B007TVANDM|5.0|As the subject line says, my two year old daughter loves this book. In fact, she asks me to read it over, and over, and over again...that would be in a row. It has replaced all of her other books, so I thought I had better get more Pete the Cat books for my own sanity. Which I did. Hopefully, I will be able to read 3 different books tomorrow night.

B005LAIIPS|5.0|THere were a lot of positive and negative reviews about the movie.  The only way to develop your own opinion is to watch the movie yourself.  I really enjoy how they recreated a new story line.  I think thats the biggest thing people have to understand.  This isnt Matt Damons Bourne movie anymore.  The Bourne series is not dead, its just recreated.
B008JFUNAU|4.0|Okay, Margaret Hamilton may be rolling in her grave. But L. Frank Baum probably won't be, because OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL for the most part succeeds as an homage and as a prequel. The plot concerns the shady origins of he who would become the legendary Wizard of Oz. And for that, we turn to the dusty plains of Kansas and a traveling circus and a low-rent magic show. Oscar Diggs is a small-time charlatan and a terrible cheat and an unflagging womanizer. We set eyes on him in 1905, in the drab back roads of Kansas, as he works his acts of prestidigitation. Oscar Diggs is remorseless in the bilking of his gullible marks. He does it with a twinkle in his eye.<br /><br />And yet Diggs has a knack for alienating folks. When he infuriates a carnival strongman, Diggs must frantically pull up stakes. He soars away on a hot air balloon, only to get sucked into the twister. The next bit is familiar territory.<br /><br />Disney spent north of $300 million on budget and advertising. And when you invest that many bones in a project, then you'd best fix the odds in your favor by hiring on someone like Sam Raimi. There's no denying the film's visual virtuosity. As one of many nods toward the original 1939 classic, Raimi frames the prologue sequence in black and white and in old-school 4:3 Academy ratio, holding out until Diggs' tumultuous arrival in Oz before the screen explodes in vivid color and expands to Cinemascope.<br /><br />In the land of Oz a prophecy circulates, foretelling the coming of a mighty wizard who would end the tyranny of the Wicked Witch. James Franco is steady, if not spectacular, as Oscar Diggs. I understand that Johnny Depp was first offered this role, and I wonder if Franco was channeling Depp a bit in his performance. There's grandstanding and a quirkiness to Oscar Diggs. Word is, Franco took lessons from Lance Burton to help sell the sleight-of-hand stuff. From the first moment on, Diggs is presented as a charming heel, and Franco is very good at translating this onscreen. When informed by a naive witch that he's destined to be the next king, one can see the dollar signs light up his eyes. Not even the caveat of having to first destroy the Wicked Witch before he can claim the throne does much in the way of dissuasion. Off he goes on that yellow brick road, with his top hat and bag of tricks and accompanied by a china doll and a talking, flying monkey in a bellhop uniform. Can empty theatrics and pure bluff win the day?<br /><br />Me, I'm starved for stories about the land of Oz. L. Frank Baum's Oz adventures are some of the earliest books I'd read as a kid. This prequel film isn't close to supplanting the 1939 MGM picture, but it's an honest, earnest enough effort that I feel good rating it 3.5 out of 5 stars. OZ THE GREAT AND POWERFUL rolls out enough references to that other movie that I'm satisfied with the continuity and connectivity between the two. Sam Raimi's trademark jittery camera pans and zooms provide interesting perspectives. Two CG-generated characters threaten to steal the show: Diggs' wisecracking monkey sidekick Finley (Zack Braff) and the delicate but adventurous China Doll girl (Joey King). Of the three witches, Rachel Weisz fares the best as the scheming Evanora. Michelle Williams as Glinda is properly sweet and wise and, okay, bland. Mila Kunis suffers the most as the heartsick Theodora who later undergoes an odd transformation. Kunis does okay in her early segments but cannot rally when her character later requires a show of dramatic flair.<br /><br />For those curious, yes, Bruce Campbell does make his inevitable cameo. No, he doesn't play the Wicked Witch, even though he's got the chin for it.<br /><br />I wouldn't be at all surprised if kids find the 1939 film more frightening. Margaret Hamilton's original, theatrically cackling Wicked Witch of the West has inspired nightmares for generations of children. Not to mention, it's harder for kids to identify with a grown man than with a lost little girl from Kansas. One inescapable element of the prequel is that the future is already predetermined. The prequel serves as a filler-in-the-blank. We know that this pretend wizard's fight, should he win it, works merely as a treading water maneuver. It's the little girl from Kansas who settles matters with finality, not the wizard. We know there's a far greater and more magical adventure still ahead. In 1939.ttle girl from Kansas.

B001JIHGO0|3.0|Note: I saw this via XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Stephen Sommers' follow-up to THE MUMMY and THE MUMMY RETURNS is a mixed bag of an homage to the classic Dracula, Frankenstein and Wolfman films of the 1930's and 1940's. The script suffers from a lack of character development for Van Helsing, especially in explaining his tortured past, of which we hear a bit from Dracula in one scene and a bit more during the intense climax. Kate Beckinsale's character, however, is well-developed. The score is quite good, and is reminiscent at times of THE MUMMY RETURNS. The acting is excellent from Hugh Jackman & Kate Beckinsale (sporting a very credible foreigh accent; is it Romanian?). The same, however, cannot be said for Richard Roxburgh as the main villain Dracula. He came across as somewhat effeminate and too over-the-top to be truly menacing. I think Gary Oldman would have made for a much more intriguing villain, as he had already played the Count to maximum effect in Bram Stoker's Dracula, which I consider to be the definitive film version of the novel by Mr. Stoker. And what was that nonsense in the middle about Dracula having babies? Can vampires actually procreate as humans do? Suspension of disbelief is required, but here, it flies out the window once this plotline is introduced.<br /><br />I recommend this film for one-time viewing only.
B005LAIISA|5.0|Manny, Diego, and Sid are back for another adventure. They surely dont disappoint in this movie either.  There is still enough humor for Kids and just enough jokes for adult humor.  I also enjoy how they introduce new characters to keep the movies changing.  Also, Scrat has a great intro!.  I cant remember the last time I laughed that hard!
B00A7CF1QY|5.0|If you like spy movies, you'll like this one.  If you're a bit of a &#34;snob&#34; about it you might have a few squabbles with certain parts but for the most part this is just a good fun old fashioned spy movie with a new school twist!

B003QS9WIE|5.0|Note: I saw this movie in HD via XFinity On Demand.<br /><br />Christopher Nolan's follow-up to the reinvigoration of Batman is a classy suspense thriller that is complex and intriguing. Multiple viewings are certainly needed in order to fully grasp the multi-layered mystery (or is it mysteries?) presented here. Christian Bale does an equally convincing job here as he did in Batman Begins, playing a man who may not be what he seems, and perhaps even more. Hugh Jackman does a spot-on American accent, while Scarlett Johannsson and Piper Perabo do equally impressive British accents. Academy Award winner Sir Michael Caine rounds out the main cast, with singer David Bowie (HOLY SMOKES!!!) proving that he is more than just a singer, Mel Brooks' Sherrif of Nottingham Roger Rees and Peter Jackson's Gollum bringing up the rear (and by no means is that meant in a negative light). Jonathan Nolan (co-writer of The Dark Knight & The Dark Knight Rises and creator, executive producer and writer of the new hit drama PERSON OF INTEREST, currently in its second season on CBS) makes his screenwriting debut with this film, working alongside his brother Christopher Nolan, and the genius of their pairing is seen here, in their first collaboration. Very well-written film, with plenty of twists and \\"Turn\\"s to keep the audience spell-bound. And we certainly are. If you think you know how good the Nolan Brothers are together, see where it all began: with The Prestige.

B001XV3LSS|4.0|I hadn't seen Contact since I saw it in theaters as a kid. As with a lot of contemporaneous movies with similar themes (Antz/Bugs Life, Prestige/Illusionist, etc.) I get this confused with Deep Impact, which I think delivered more in the area of special effects.  Contact had a big influence on me as a kid, and fueled the wonderful childish curiosity I had about space, science, and the search for Extraterrestrial Life.<br /><br />That said, I had forgotten about the cheesy melodrama between Jodie Foster and Matthew Maconaghey (whose character could have been removed and the movie wouldn't have suffered) and the overplayed &#34;david and goliath&#34; trope about Jodie Foster vs. &#34;The Man.&#34;  I would have loved to see more about what we've learned about the universe and our place in it, and less about petty interpersonal relationships.

I could read only  a few pages at a time, I believe it was good to do that, gave time to digest what was going on. First time I read a book like this and first time for this author. I would purchase another of her books. Makes you really think do we know our children??

B00843TZJ2|4.0|I saw pretty much the same CS&N concert last summer and thoroughly enjoyed it. They were very engaging and they were not just phoning it in like say Van Morrison. I had very low expectations and went because they were one of the few groups left that were on my \\"bucket list\\" and wanted to bring my young son. A few months before that I saw Stephen Stills play in a small 500 seat venue and was lucky enough to be in the front row. Stephen is pretty much deaf and that's why his voice is so bad despite using hearing aids. He jokes about it during the show. When people call out requests he says, \\"yell all you want. I can't hear you anyway.\\" Nonetheless, he is still one of the greatest guitarists alive and its worth it just to see him ply his craft. He barely gets a chance to show his chops on this DVD/CD, but he can definitely still bring it. Anyone who goes to see groups of this vintage and expects them to sound like they did 40 years ago is being unrealistic. It's not like you can't sample the songs on Amazon or I-Tunes before you buy it so the quality of their voices shouldn't be a surprise. Go back and listen to 4-Way Street. They sounded even crappier live then!

B002ZG98UK|5.0|this was a five-star movie from a 3D perspective and belongs in any 3D collection. The first 10 minutes alone make it worth the purchase as it was clearly built for a 3D audience. The storyline was also enjoyable - yes that's going against all the critics. If we believed critics then every Oscar winning movie should be a blockbuster but it's not. Critics - I took two film classes in college - love to talk about artistic style but it's more along political ideology or what they view from a personal belief of what is a great movie.<br /><br />Movies were created in America for one reason - to escape reality. That simple and that's the truth. With that said, this is a movie based on a video game that's based on zombies, something that doesn't exist in the real world. When you take it from that perspective and ignore the baseless realities of critics you'll also enjoy the movie.

B00BNWWVFG|4.0|Emily (Rooney Mara) is clinically depressed. She has been seeing a psychologist (Catherine Zeta-Jones). Her white collar criminal husband (Channing Tatum) is getting out of jail, which leads to more depression. Having failed a suicide attempt, Emily is placed on medication and does the unthinkable. At this point the film goes into an odd mystery/thriller, one where everyone knows who done it. Just when you think you have it figured out, it twists, having more twists than Taylor Swift having break-up songs. Jude Law plays Dr. Jonathan Banks, a man caught in the middle of all of this.<br /><br />I didn't know what to expect going into this feature. It is best not to read the reviews as it is impossible to write anything without giving away too much of the plot. If you like mystery thrillers with twists and clues that hurt your head like a Hitchcock masterpiece, this one will fit the bill. If you know anyone who takes meds for depression, then you can enjoy the film on a different level.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bombs, sex, very brief nudity (Rooney Mara)

B0049P1VHS|5.0|Zombies definitely scare me and I like being scared. If you like being scared and the idea of a zombie apocalypse appeals to you then be sure to check this out. It really takes a couple of episodes to get to know all the characters but the show comes together pretty quickly after the second ep I think. The show also seems to parallel the comic book but not exactly- there are subtle differences. Lots of action too. And you never know who's gonna die and who's gonna live. They really keep you guessing since no one is really safe. Lots of bonus stuff on the dvd's- almost too much. I don't like seeing too much behind the scenes stuff b/c it takes away from the realness of the show. The scenery is gorgeous too since they really film in some of those small Southern towns in Georgia in and around Atlanta. The characters are so real- not at all laughable. It really makes you think about how profoundly life would change if a zombie apocalypse really occurred. This show is extremely violent and gory so beware of letting kids or even adults with jumpy hearts watch! If you like to be scared then this is a show for you.
B00BLGZDYA|3.0|The premise of the film is fairly easy to comprehend, although many reviewers seem puzzled by the format and editing. The main character, played by Denis Lavant, is a highly paid mercenary actor aptly named Oscar. His clients hire him to act out their fantasies in real life by seemingly abruptly intruding into their everyday existence and playing out some oddball fantasy script. To wit, Kay M (played by Eva Mendez) is a woman with obvious image issues who goes from preening at a fashion shoot to being kidnapped by a hobo (played by Oscar). The hobo takes her into a cave where instead of raping her, makes her wear a burka... The point of this particular tale being a philosophical inquiry into what is the correct 'posture' for a strong beautiful woman to adopt, struggling between the extremes of narcissism as a fashion model to a retiring beauty hidden by a full body burka.<br /><br />The other tales follow a similar psychodrama style, wherein a banker pretends to get murdered at a restaurant on the Champs Elys&eacute;es, a teenager acts out some unresolved father-daughter conflict and a flight attendant (played by Kylie Minogue) mourns her lost lover before committing suicide.<br /><br />The pacing of the movie is slow by American standards and will no doubt tax the average viewer. The different chapters can be seen as small stand alone short subjects, but really only come into focus when viewed as a whole. The ending is perhaps the most surprising part because it seems to confuse the matter even more.  If however you keep in mind the film's beginning and the fact that Oscar is driven around in a 'holy' limousine, perhaps what we are witnessing are Oscar's own post-mortem fantasies.<br /><br />There are many hidden clues and nods to film buffs, from the main characters' name Oscar, to the Jean Seberg wig sported by Kylie Minogue. However, I find the rhythm to be ponderous, as is wont for typical French fare. Additionally some areas feel unresolved, like the motion capture sex scene which feels amateurish and shows Leos Carax' disdain for the splashy computer generated films of today. There are other hints of his displeasure with modern day moviemaking as when Oscar complains to Michel Piccoli that actors can no longer even see the cameras anymore because they are so miniaturized. Even the cars complain at the end that they feel obsolete. Perhaps the most pervading message Leos Carax tries to get across is a sense of regret over the loss of glamour in films today. There is a certain charm to this posture that I somewhat share although I feel this particular movie could have used some sharper crafting.sex scene which feels amateurish and shows Leos Carax' disdain for the splashy computer generated films of today.

The writing is still good and the characters still very believable. The gang is now hiding out on a farm owned by a doctor who lives there with his two daughters. Conflicts arise and the group spends a lot of time fighting each other as well as others out in the world- ones who aren't zombies or \\"walkers.\\" Of course there are plenty of walkers to contend with here and they are still scary as heck! But this second season is also great for the same reasons that the first season was so cool. Beware there is even more blood and gore in this season. The show is starting to remind me an awful lot of \\"LOST\\" only on a Georgia farm instead of on an island and instead of Others we have Walkers... Just a thought!
B007PAAO0Y|5.0|The Bravest Man in The Universe is a surprisingly good new Bobby Womack product. This mixture of classic R&B sounds with the production values of today really works on many levels. This is a great combination of message and music that I highly recommend.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|This is a great movie for the family to sit down and watch.  It has good classy humor, and great values through out the movie!  I would totally recomend!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This the Best Bible App.. it gives you everything you need for effective bible study, notes, both public and private, related/reference scripture available at a touch, it even suggest bible study plans. It can be use on or offline. So much more....GET THIS APP
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|I chose 4 stars because it was not really my type of book but was a great book. I did not like how at the end of the book it didnt give a whole lot of information. I would recommend this book to my grandpa.
B001EN71HC|1.0|The sound is terrible, I wanted blue-ray probably would have been better to buy regular DVD. I would not reccomend this for a frend!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Cool game g5. I love hidden object games n this one has a good story line as well. Keep'em comn'!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Just a really amazing story about some cancer kids and their life, their loves. Very smartly written. Witty, humorous, thought provoking dialogue.
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie is fantastic. A good mix of intense emotion and humor. not to mention the cast was superb! I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Both kids and adults alike will love Wreck It Ralph. Disney apparently acquired the rights to images from Sonic the Hedgehog, Pac Man, Q-Bert, Super Mario, and several other &#34;old school&#34; Atari or original NES video games to use in this movie. That coupled with modern shooter games and go-kart racing games can bring the interest level from kids aged 5 through kids aged 40.  It has a great plot and heart warming characters. In other words it has all the wonderful aspects Disney brings to film. Highly recommend this movie.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Total addictive game! My poor husband is a kindle widow because I want to play this game all the time.
B0054YH8VQ|5.0|You just can't go wrong with Billy Joel.  I've always liked his music.  I bought this album specifically to get Stiletto.  I've never figured out why it doesn't appear on any of his &#34;Greatest Hit's&#34; albums.  Oh well, it's worth it to me.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I really enjoy card games. I would recommend this game to anyone. Amazon makes it easy to download. I would like to see more games.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The message was a good one and reminds us to live everyday as if it is your last. Easy read and inspiring.
034580404X|5.0|I found that the trilogy had a great story about Christian and why he is the way he is. For me, E L James put so much heart and soul into Anastasia to help guide the man she loves. As for the SEX...... *fans self* It was some the hottest scenes of passion and I just love, love, LOVE the little silver balls. These books will definitely have you squirming in your seat. I also have them in audio book for from audible.com and to have Becca Battoe read them made them even better.<br />You may even get your own set of little silver balls but they may be on back order. LOL Still waiting for mine.
B0006B3UEQ|4.0|Not a big Tom Cruise fan I nevertheless have to admit that I was convinced of his role as contract killer in this film. Jamie Foxx is also outstanding as the hapless, but intelligent, and ultimately resourceful cab driver Max.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Who doesn't like angry birds? This was the first game on my kindle and remains one of my favorites. Fun!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really really really really really like this game it is one of the best games I have ever played I always play when I'm bored
B006C1DH92|5.0|This is a very fun game... probably one of my favorites! It is very addicting and if you like fruit ninja you will definitely like this. In Puss on Boots it has Desperado which is like the classic level on fruit ninja, and then it has another game ( cant think of the name, sorry!) which is like a bunch of mini levels put together and you have three lives.... I like all the different blades and backgrounds they are fun to unlock, this game is very addicting and is SUPER FUN! I'm sure that you will like it! =)
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Maggie Smith is incredible! Actually, all the characters are fantastic. The story comes to life on screen. See one episode and you will have to see them all (more than once).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is totally awesome from the other games that you can play it has different upgrades that you can play for a little money
B00B2V66VS|4.0|When I first got it I loved it but now it's boring!! My dad loves it he always wants to play with it so I guess I should keep it.When I get an Ipad I will love it !!!!!! I don't like it on the kindle it is boring. Good thing I am getting an ipad.
B008VVT51U|5.0|I loved going to the Exotic Marigold Hotel. This is a feel good movie and I recommend it for all ages.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so awesomeeee! I play it every day its one of my favorite games my friends message me everyday on txt plus saying thumbs up 4 this game
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This novel was a gift and I do tend to enjoy Grisham novels. I have read majority of what he has published. It is well written, but the book lacks substance and I do not feel author was really into it.  Maybe he was just trying to fulfill a contract obligation with the publisher.
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|This is my kind of movie. Unusual bunch with usual problems.The cinematography and camera angles make this movie quite macabre.
B001U7IJV4|4.0|I'm not sure what the lesson or plot of this movie is but it captures my attention throughout. The 'wondering whats going to happen as he gets younger' was enough to keep me watching.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I purchased Hopeless after a simple note from a friend \\"A must read\\". WOW!! Was she ever accurate. I had zero idea what I was walking into but this is one of the best books I have read in a very long time. I'm not necessarily a YA fan but Colleen Hoover has made me one and quickly.<br /><br />I was riveted from the first page and couldn't put it down. I immediately empathized and admired Sky. I think I had an immediate chemical reaction to Holder. The dynamics of friendship, family, love and firsts completely blew me away.<br /><br />Without spoilers I will say that if Colleen Hoover can do this with 18 year olds, I can't imagine what her books would do to me if they were more mature adults.<br /><br />If I could give this more than 5 stars I would. It is a keeper!!!
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Mr. Draper, good grief!! I just love this show so much!! It is fantastically stylish and sooooo dang sexy!! I love the fashion and all the mid-century style furniture!
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like this better than the Mahjong on my iPod because it has different modes and many more towers. The time challenges are my favorites.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|Got this because it was on Oprah's book club, liked it but I was expecting so much more from the book. Even with that it's a pretty good read.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|Careful here guys, if you have a completionist streak in you, you will keep coming back to this to eke out that last star.<br /><br />I really appreciate the trajectory predictor line, that helps a lot. However, the tablet interface isn't quite so precise so you can't perfectly hit the same shot repeatedly with any confidence. Retry-apalooza! Oh....
B008B8DY2O|5.0|This is a book that I did not want to end.  I almost started it again immediately after I had finished it.  This is a book that I will read several times in the future.  The story is amazing, and the writing skill is some of the best I have come across.  I just absolutely loved reading it.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|I'll admit, it is really cool to scribble in a quick math problem, but... it does it a bit too quickly if you know what I mean. I can't really do more than a couple numbers at a time without everything shifting around as it transcribes the scribbles.
0525953590|4.0|It is somewhat difficult to write a review of a book you finished reading months ago, but Carroll's book was so good, this reviewer felt a moral incumbency to prompt the following description.  Given the fact that other reviews already unpack a detailed review of `The Particle at the End of the Universe,' (\\"The Particle\\") and the weekly news pronouncements about the likelihood that the July 4, 2012 finding is looking more-and-more like this may turn out to be the elusive particle on which billions of dollars was spent to corroborate Peter Higgs, a particle physicist, who is the brainchild behind this initial theory.  Much of these monies included the building of the Large Hadron Collider (\\"LHC\\") in order to \\"create\\" the first Higgs particle--and this is a possibility (not yet a probability).<br /><br />The Particle's reading level for the initiated is 18+ years up.  The book is very accessible and the contents of the book coupled with the manner in which Carroll lays out his material, the book flows like a fictional novel making it highly accessible even for the uninitiated (i.e., those unfamiliar with this genre and the books subject matter).  For these latter people interested in purchasing The Particle, you will not require any prerequisite knowledge unless you have never read any materials on physics.  If this is the case, I would suggest Leon Lederman's `Quantum Physics for Poets,' which is likely the most accessible and up-to-date book on physics and quantum physics out of the dozens released each year.<br /><br />Also, publishers obviously have to capitalize on issues that will sell books, and the possible discovery of the Higgs prompted two other fine books to be published around the same time: `Higgs Force: The Symmetry-Breaking Force that Makes the World an Interesting Place' by Nicholas Mee, and Jim Baggot's `Higgs: The Invention & Discovery of the `God Particle.''--both of which are find books.  However, out of all 3 books, Carroll's book is by far the most accessible for those with little to no background in these areas.<br /><br />(Leon Lederman s new book `Beyond the God Particle' is set to be released in early October of this year.  Lederman, winner of the 1988 Nobel Prize in Physics for discovering there is more than one type of neutrino, is credited for coining the term `The God Particle' from is derived from his book entitled with the same name; and, which is the media's favorite name for the Higgs Boson and Lederman's least favorite title as he is an explicit atheist.)<br /><br />This review assumes that the reader has some basic background on quantum field theory, symmetry, the fundamental forces and all of the other pieces of information.  The theory behind the Higgs is that it is a particle that plays a fundamental role in the creation order at the beginning of our universe.  The universe allegedly began in a symmetrical state and the Higgs \\"broke this symmetry\\" during the first moments of the universe and enabled matter that formed within the universe to evolve into the complex and diverse structures we see today throughout the cosmos and our world.  That is to say, at the very beginning there were not 4 fundamental forces (e.g., gravity, the weak and strong force, and electromagnetism) until the Higgs boson, which carries its own force, broke this basic symmetry down creating the fundamental forces.  The Higgs is supposed to break the symmetry between the forces AND just as importantly, it is to give mass to \\"most\\" of the elementary particles as these particles move through the Higgs field.<br /><br />As Carroll states in the Prologue to The Particle, \\"The Higgs particle arises from a field pervading space, known as the `Higgs field.'  Everything in the known universe, as it travels through space, moves through the Higgs field\\" which is always lurking in the background.  Carroll continues, \\"And it matters: Without the Higgs, electrons and quarks would be massless, just like photons . . . They would move at the speed of light themselves, and it would be impossible to form atoms and molecules, much less life as we know it.  The Higgs field isn't an active player on the dynamics of ordinary matter, but its presence in the background is crucial.  Without it, the world would be an utterly different place\\" (page 5).<br /><br />Carroll's description of the possible creation of the Higgs is both tentative and honest, like a true scientist.  Carroll is not claiming that we know for sure and he is quick to quash popular rumors that \\"the Higgs has been found,\\" as one finds such averments on the front page of their Yahoo homepage once every 2 weeks.<br /><br />The contents of the Particle contains 3 appendixes that unpack a more detailed and graduate level description of (1) spin; (2) the standard model of particles (what Marcus Chown calls the Particle Zoo); and, (3) a discussion of particles and their interactions.  However, the rest of the book is where the reader will be drawn into Carroll's world.  As I stated above, this review is not meant to unpack the contents of Carroll's book, a task that has been completed numerous times by other reviews.<br /><br />My purpose is to inform the reader (as they can tell by my other reviews) that this is the most accessible book on the Higgs currently in print.  That does not make it the best as this depends on one's background knowledge, but Carroll does simplify, much like Lederman's book , concepts such as quantum field theory, symmetry, string theory, M-theory and \\"branes\\" is a simple, not simplistic manner, that makes the reader feel as if they are veterans of quantum field theory.  I highly recommend this book.e at the speed of light themselves, and it would be impossible to form atoms and molecules, much less life as we know it.

B0050PYNO4|5.0|Just good fun and a great movie. Could watch it 100 times. Everybody should buy and watch this movie. It's great for the whole family
B007UXSPK2|3.0|I started watching this late on a weeknight and had a hard time turning it off to go to bed.  I was into it, but my beauty sleep is more important.  It's nothing amazing but definitely entertaining.
1476712042|5.0|Rating: 5 Stars<br />This book was a whirlwind of emotions for me! I loved it, then I wanted to scream and throw it the characters frustrated me so much, and then I loved it again! The title completely fits this story. Abby and Travis are a Beautiful Disaster! They ultimately belong together. It just takes a while and obstacles to get them to their happy ending. I rated this book 5 stars because any story that can cause as many emotions in me as this one deserves it! I can't wait for the next book that is told from Travis's point of view, Walking Disaster.
B00942XS04|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, but it was pretty different than the first one.  My husband didn't like that somebody called somebody a &#34;jerk' in the beginning, but besides that it was tiny tot appropriate (it is G rated after all).
B00992CF6W|5.0|its awesome It is so addicting but not as addicting you spend all day I still get to posy outside
B004NSHBCK|5.0|This CD comes from a set remastered in DSD for the non-US market in the mid-2000s.  While it is NOT an SACD, the sonics easily exceed my older Sony Esssential classics recording, and are worth seeking out for the audiophile.  I'll leave it to others to explain why, but it just \\"works.\\"<br /><br />The CD itself is printed to look like a vinyl record, a nice touch.<br /><br />The Tchaikovsky is one of the best-in-class and compares favorably to my Mint-Minus LP of the same recording.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its so addictive its 1a.m. and I'm still up playing it, this makes 3 hours that I have been on it. Now if only it had a music selector.
B006MGDVFM|5.0|Excellent historical documentary. We enjoyed the racing feature and the amount of detailed revealed.<br />Both my husband and I loved the movie.
B0033AX26I|5.0|If you are looking for new music, this is an album to try. It is amazing how The Chieftains are able to capture the essence of Mexican and Irish music and blend them together. A very enjoyable album with interesting history behind it.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I usually do not write reviews on books; i'm a consumer of great writing, not a producer ;) however, I do feel compelled to review 'The Night Circus' because it simply is amazing. Once I began to read it in earnest (only about the second chapter) I realized that books like this make me LOVE reading. I want nothing more than to stroll the avenues of the mysterious and beautiful establishment known simply as the Night Circus and the scenes the writer paints are as deep and intriguing as her characters which are astounding as the plot line. The plot is original, the forever tragic teenage love story takes on a whole new meaning as their fates intertwine to a surprising and incredibly satisfying/mystifying conclusion.<br />thanks!

B00005JMYI|5.0|Probably one of Ferrell's best roles. Anchorman is a movie that you will remember and quote over and over. An instant comedy classic.
B009NPK1IO|5.0|The last season of gossip girl is definitely the best an most dramatic season. I like that this show is unpredictable and full of drama!
B00991TCOG|5.0|This compilation of Lindsey's original work is one of the best. Never could you have imagined a pop and dubstep sound lead by a violin. Simply an amazing artist and a wonderful performer.
0345803507|5.0|Great book! it is kind of explicit and your wondering what is going on with this and for those of us that are not familiar with this lifestyle it is kind of shocking but as you continue reading and reading you just can't put the book down because you want to know what's wrong. It is funny i found myself laughing. It is kind of repetative but nonetheless I did enjoy reading it. I have read all three books and I thought they are all entertaining.
B003YGSLDA|5.0|Saw this movie years ago and I loved it. One of my favorite movies. Looking foward to watching this over the Christmas holiday.

B001TCHDPS|5.0|A girlfriend introduced me to Rodriguez in the 70's. i've been a fan ever since. The guy is a poet and supports his profound lyrics with beautiful melody. It's a shame Rodriguez never got the recognition he deserved, although the mystery surrounding his persona at the time only added to his mystique.<br /><br />Now that he has achieved a measure of fame thanks to &#34;Searching for Sugarman', I wonder if we will ever hear some new music from this remarkable talent.

B005JZBPHS|1.0|Nearly every disc in this collection has a flaw, although the package was unopened when I received it. The DVDs skip, blur, and eventually just stop playing. I would not recommend this product to anyone.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|I was one of the lucky few who saw Rodriguez perform live when he toured Australia in the early 1980's. On stage he was humble to the point of appearing slightly uncomfortable. Nevertheless he performed the set with all the polish of a true professional.<br /><br />I am pleased his music has been resurrected. If you like profound lyrics delivered with a dash of bittersweet melody then you will love the music of Rodriguez
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I also own Season 1 & 2. I love being able to watch the episodes of the season without having to wait a week. I was thrilled that Season 3 was available on DVD almost immediately after it had aired, so I didn't have to wait months before watching it -- especially with so many spoilers (I had to mute the TV a couple of times to not find out the surprise ending).
B007BFSYMS|4.0|I figured out how to get some nature, &quot;cricket&quot; type sounds to play, so that I may fall asleep - and this app most definitely does well in aiding sleep. What I find disappointing is this feeling I have that there are more features - some I might even like - and I can't find my way to them. Probably my fault, I am tired after all. Good night.

B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good reading although the middle seemed to drag a bit. The ending was a little abrupt as well.  Good John Grisham though...
B008JGSM6G|4.0|It's challenging without being impossible, and is fun on a kindle. One does not need great eyesight to play this.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Loved the color and how it works.  I dont even like pink so I almost didnt buy it but I loved the shade of pink on this when I received it.  Pics dont do it justice.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Not a lot to choose from, and the puzzles are not challenging in any way. And the selection is pretty standard.
B0049VZ222|2.0|I watched episode 3 then watched it again with my wife. Amazon charged me twice. I looked through the help page as to where to challenge this..but good luck with that. I can leave a review!
B00683JK9K|3.0|These puzzles are pleasurable to look at, and the feature allowing you to choose the amount of pieces is a plus, as is the option to start with just edge pieces.Very relaxing. The only down side is that there are not enough puzzles to choose from.
0385535147|5.0|This is, in my opinion, Grisham's best yet...the plot is a twisting, turning, convoluted mess, but it kept me enthalled all the way through.  I noticed in his acknowledgements that he didn't research a lot, and this was very much fictional.  I tried to draw it out to make the suspense last, but finally gave in and finished it.  I love Grisham, and being a legal assistant in a law firm, I can usually identify with the legal aspects of his books.  This one was by far my favorite.

B004BJMEO6|5.0|This movie is done very well and has a great story to tell, we have watched it some twenty times. We still discuss how the story compares to our relationship beginning, and most likely many others.
0062082353|2.0|The quality of the book was poor the pages were cut unevenly very poor quality paper the only part of the book that was satisfactory was the cover. I guess you cant judge a book by its cover
B00BHU2A7I|1.0|How can you miss with these two fabulous actors! But it did....I watched a portion of the movie and had to pause to do something else and never went back. What a disappointment.
0142423432|5.0|I was introduced to this book through the film.  I really loved the film (though, I'm the only one I know who does)  I love the characters and the atmosphere; however, the film can be depressing.<br /><br />I came into this not entirely sure what to expect, I've recently tracked down the books some of my favorite movies are based on and I've found that more often than not I actually preferred the films (much to my dismay since reading is my passion).  The characters are less pronounced in the book than the film but the mood is much lighter despite telling the same story.  Although I am a tad disappointed to see that my favorite character from the movie, Kristofferson, wasn't a character in the original story.<br /><br />I've read that some people dislike the abrupt ending to this, but I think that the story is the exact length it needed to be.  The price of the book, however, is absurd.  This is a very short story and a fast reader will devour it before they have time to get comfortable in their favorite reading chair.
B000FCKIFU|5.0|This book, which introduces the title group, has a somewhat lumbering start as each character is fleshed out.  But, once done, the storyline ebbs and flows as the drama and intrigue build.  I actually got goosebumps at one part towards the end.  Another hit for Mr. Baldacci.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|looking forward to reading book 3!  The author has done a great job with the complexity of the characters & their interactions.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesome and as soon as I go on I can't get off because I just want to beat my high score.

B00AHSIQWE|2.0|I think I paid $4 to rent this movie.  I am not sure I. Would watch it again if you paid me $5.
B005MMYBXI|5.0|When I watched Spartacus: Blood and Sand for the first time, it was when I was stuck at an airport for 9 hours due to flight cancellations.  I have always been a fan of ancient Rome movies and shows...yes, I even used to be addicted to Xena: Warrior Princess.  I finally bit the bullet and paid to download season 1 and FELL IN LOVE.  The characters, the drama, the violence (totally gratuitous in most places, but visually uh-Mazing!), the sex...everything about it was raw and engaging.  I did some research on Andy Whitfield, and when I realized that Gods of the Arena was made as a prequel, essentially to buy time while everyone hoped for his recovery, I almost didn't even bother with it.  But I am SO glad that I did.  The characters in Gods of the Arena bring SO much to the table, and I fell in love with them.  Seeing the start of the villains and the O. G.s (Original Gladiators...Ice T anyone?)  really made seasons 2 and 3 so much more impacting.  As sad as Andy Whitfield's untimely death is, the creators of the show have definitely done his character justice in continuing on such a strong path.  If you're wondering if you need to see this \\"prequel\\" season in order to enjoy seasons 2 and 3, the answer is YES!  It clears up so much.  *Team Gannicus!* Enjoy!

B001R0LOES|5.0|Wonderful movie to watch , loved it. I would tell anyone to watch this movie and give it a chance because it is good and pretty historically accurate.
B004I744AS|4.0|I have tried several other dictionary apps and this one has been the best so far.  It is fast and accurate.  My only complaint is when you look up a word like embarrassment, it gives the definition to be embarrassed and does not define embarrass, which in most cases is what a person needs.
0142410705|5.0|An Abundance of Katherines, by John Green, is a fantastic book about finding an identity and moving on to the future. When anagram-loving Colin Singleton turns eighteen, turning from child prodigy to just smart and the nineteenth girl named Katherine he has dated dumps him, he is rather depressed about his life. His best friend, Hassan Harbish, convinces him to go on a road trip to quell some of his sorrow. They end up stopping in Gutshot, Tennessee to see the alleged body of Archduke Franz Ferdinand, which turns out to be a fake. They decide to stay in Gutshot, despite its small population. Colin becomes obsessed with having a \\"Eureka moment.\\" He thinks that his eureka moment will be creating a theorem to predict the length of any given relationship between two people. Eventually, he finally realizes that he doesn't have to be a genius to be himself and he feels \\"non-unique in the very best way possible.\\"<br /> I enjoyed every page of this book. It contains enough life lessons to make it useful and enough humor to make it easy and fun to read. Colin's failed theorem shows how even the seemingly most constant things and events are truly random. It also does a great job of teaching how to embrace who you are because you can't change it. His anagrams show how any situation can be turned around into something completely different. Even while it is packed with life lessons, An Abundance of Katherines is a very interesting book. It has enough action to keep it exciting, but not enough to overwhelm the reader. It has enough humor to keep it lighthearted, but not so much as to ruin the mood of some of the more unhappy parts. The only negative thing I can say about this book is that it ended rather abruptly. It goes from Colin telling the story of all the Katherines to the end in just a few short pages. This is a good book for any teenager to read, especially those with a good sense of humor. Anyone who has enjoyed other books by John Green will surely enjoy this one.
6305428271|5.0|Always have liked this movie. Gave to a friend who wants to be an inner city school teacher and make a difference.
B009GEOLM4|5.0|Sadly I have yet to read the comic but hear it's different on a few key scenes.<br />I still liked this movie though.<br />Felt like a kid getting excited but it's a bit more mature than BTAS.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|Solo worth it... I never thought I would enjoy such a little kids game. I don't know if I should be ashamed or amazed.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was surprisingly great. I was not expecting the quality of movie that I got with it. The story was deep but yet very easy to follow. It kept me guessing the whole time, and was action packed enough to keep me very engaged. It was also very, very funny. It had lots of puns and great jokes. I loved this movie.

B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I don't think there is one album that I do not like by Josh. I got to see him in concert in 2011 and it was just awesome so I rushed and purchased this as soon as I saw it was coming out.  I've spun it several hundred times already and still not tired of it. I like that it is a mixture of sounds but all the songs are Josh and his voice and lyrics carry through as they have on all the previous albums. I do wish that the bonus tracks on the Target Stores version was on iTunes or Amazon MP3. I hate not hearing every single song from artist that I love. Feel cheated but can't go buy it a 3rd time ;) haha  Hope this helps!
B0041KKYEM|1.0|This movie was terrible, Everyone says \\"It's Unique\\". \\"It's so artsy.\\" \\"It's so creative.\\" NO NO NO! It's just a BAD Movie. I sat through it once and sat there dumbfounded at the end. Watched it again to see what I may have missed or what not and I came to the same conclusion. I want my 2 1/2 hours back.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|If you haven't seen this yet, GO SEE IT!!! It's AWESOME, funny and the music is amazing! I'm a guy by the way lol and I really enjoyed it.  This album is awesome. I like the songs Popular, Defying Gravity, As Long As You're Mine and What Is This Feeling. I got the MP3 version with auto rip so I also got the CD in the mail to donate to Good WIll.<br /><br />I saw this on Broadway in NYC in 2010 and still one of my favs if not my favorite.
0345803485|4.0|Very descriptive book and captures your attention from the first chapter.  Love reading a book and visualizing the movie in my head..its a very easy read.
B002TLSSXO|5.0|I was skeptical because they weren't the traditional ones that I was use to but the reviews were so good I thought I will trust it and go for it. Man, I'm so glad I did. The handles are weighted so it's really a joy to use them, plus they are very comfortable to grip. On top of that they have a little stand built in so the end never touches the counter or whatever you are sitting it on, which keeps it from making a mess.  I have no regrets and highly recommend these to anyone if you are a light cooker or a chef, these will be your new love ;)
0062238868|4.0|A good look at what it was like to be there. Very interesting read and easy to put yourself in the author's position. I'd recommend it to those interested in this type of book.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|A riveting book. It made my heart pound many times. I found it hard to put down. If you like WW2 and spy books, you get the best of both worlds.
B007REV4YI|5.0|I was dubious of the franchise reboot until I watched the first sequence of &#34;Casino Royale&#34;, when Dennis Craig became Bond #1 for me (and I grew up, and through, all of the Bond men). I know Bond fans winced heavily at &#34;Quantum of Solace&#34;, but &#34;Skyfall&#34; really has Craig and the rest of the cast finally gelling into a tight ensemble. Fantastic direction and some unbeatable cinematography combine to keep the audience riveted all the way through, and if the movie is not without its share of genuine heartbreak, it is an homage of love to a 50 year tradition that both sends off some of that history in grand style while simultaneously reinventing itself with an unimaginably slick and timely &#34;old like new&#34; re-envisioning of itself. &#34;Casino Royale&#34; proved the Bond audiences' loyalty after the lengthy gap, but &#34;Skyfall&#34; is the movie in which the franchise is *truly* rebooted in fact and style.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|It was a good read, but in the same way watching a train wreck is hard to turn away from.
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|Enjoyed this game very much! I must be old or slow because it took me longer to finish  than some of the other reviews said!
B008MM9630|5.0|fun playing this game on facebook but not  app game on my kindle it has a lot of problems. like not being able to open fortune. cookie's. or use the genie mine has said for three weeks back in 23 hours still waiting.
1439153663|5.0|I bought this book for my recent vacation.  Initially, I was worried that the subject matter might be too 'heavy' for a beach read, but it was the best book I have read in a long time. I finished the book so quickly that I felt sad when I had completed it. I felt such a connection to some of the characters that I found myself missing them when I read the last page.  The subject was not an easy one, but it is an ugly history we cannot ignore.  This story is about courage, resilience, love, and the strength of family - even when the family is anything but traditional.
B000GJ0KOG|5.0|Greetings All, What a great movie this is, lots of fun and great acting. Based on a true story with a great cast! I know you will like this one! Would buy from seller again! Cheers! William

B000LB7G00|5.0|My boyfriend was looking for some kind of mouse replacement because of wrist/palm pain and we bought 3Dconnexion. He is so amazed how intuitive and easy in use it is. He can't imagine his work in 3d softwares without it now. Great device!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this app. I like the details and color of the games. I don't care about the ad s at all. Must download game
0810989956|5.0|I bought these books for my son and not only does he love reading them, he also started making his own comics.  As a parent, it is nice when your child voluntarily stops watching TV and starts reading a book.  Great purchase.
0470450266|5.0|Wonderfull written book  loaded with a bulk of info on human anatomy in a digital enviroment. A lot of work went in to the writting of this book and it shows! Highly recommended.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I bought this mouse because of the price, and the overall good reviews. ---Build quality/ergonomics:   I found the build quality to be quite admirable, and the mouse to feel comfortable in the hand. I use a standard palm grip as opposed to the claw grip, and the contours of the mouse fit nicely. A couple things worth pointing out are that my pinky tends to hang off the side, and that the scroll wheel is a little too close to the middle of the mouse for my liking. The feet on the bottom glide very smoothly. But overall great build, and attention to detail. ---Software/Programming Buttons:   The software is very easy to use, and has some cool icons reminiscent of Diablo for selecting options. You have a variety of options to choose from, and the DPI settings are very easy to choose. Changing the light on the Anker icon is easy, but it is upsetting that you cannot adjust the light on the scroll wheel. Overall a great mouse for the price, high quality, and very good looking. Seriously people ask me about it all the time. P.S. the Anker icon looks really good in purple. :)  Edit: 19 months of use and abuse later.  Mouse broke one day in my book bag,  I'm keeping the five star rating because it most likely broke from abuse.  The manufacturer warranty was 18 months, so Anker would not replace it. They were nice enough to give me a discount if I purchased another one though.
B009Q6ADG0|5.0|Heard this at the movies and had to have it.  When she its it, it's out of the park. :)
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I enjoyed this final book of the series.  Suzanne Collins writing has been a great inspiration for my imagination.  Always something to think about, for the future.
B004Z7AHZC|1.0|This was a present and opened later only to find the dvd skipped, was not happy about it. I will not buy advance presents ever again.
B004T4KKSA|5.0|The best book I've read on the subject yet. Complete, thoroughly researched and annotated, authoritative.<br /><br />Despite its 800-odd pages this book manages to be concise.<br /><br />A seminal work.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Captured my interest immediately & kept it all the way through end. Very well written. Truly enjoyed this love story.
B005NQ5LSC|5.0|great movie but not as good as the first 2 movies but it is still agreat action movie should buy
B008KOTNVA|5.0|Has pretty much everything I need to work on most laptops and other small electronic devices. I might buy the larger kit next time...
B001DUDKEY|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies based on a Jane Austen book.  The romance unfolds subtly and the actress portrays the sadness of the main character at the beginning and the changes in her throughout the movie.  She is well-paired with the leading man.  I would recommend buying it as a DVD.  It is cheaper than the online version.  The sound and subtitles weren't in sync with the streaming version and the quality of the video was not as good as the DVD version I had previously checked out from the library.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I loved this movie, my main concern when watching a movie based on a book I have read is the fact that stuff gets messed up.  Not so, not in this one.  I loved the movie and if you love the genre then I am sure you will as well.  The special effects is amazing.<br />WaAr
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It was very eye opening and graphically depicted the sacrafices our Armed Service Members make for our freedom every day of their service.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|The twist and turns in this book will leave u breathless and wanting more. So unseen. So tragic. So very wonderfully!
B009FZFONO|5.0|The price is a bit high for the price we paid I could've waited and had the whole season on DVD/Blue Ray but impantient is my name and this was great to catch us up to current episodes.  Definitely see a big difference between the HD and non -HD (worth the extra buck!)
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Poses the question of how well doe's anyone really know their child?  And what length will you go to save that child?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I almost forgot to rate 5 stars. (Been playing on computer since Beta 1.2_01 and trying to get it #1 in app store)
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game kept me tied to my Android phone until I finished all the levels. Its such a fun little game, highly recommend it.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My wife and I, my 9 y.o. son, and my 5 y.o. daughter all loved the movie.  It has a good story line and has a good lesson to it too.  There were a couple of slightly off-color things they could have left out of a kids movie but overall not bad.  I love the DVD / BR combo because our BR is upstairs and DVD is downstairs so we don't have to worry about the kids having to find it all the time.  We just stuck the DVD in a cd pouch that has several of their DVDs in it for downstairs and keep the case upstairs.<br /><br />I recommend it for families of all ages!
B005VZQ95O|5.0|This CD contains SO many hits! I think there was only one song that I hadn't heard on this CD. I love Pink Floyd. Every song is a winner!
B004I744AS|5.0|its a great app it help out alot. i get done with home work alot fast than using a book dictionary
B00AHXIC50|5.0|Every song is a winner on this CD. Bruno is so good & I can honestly say I LOVE every song on the CD!
B00006I53S|2.0|This lense works well in low light and is built strong and runs smoothly but it annoyingly telescopes out when hanging due to the weight of the glass. when i manually zoom with it it has an annoying plastic on plastic squeeking noise. It does not affect the fuction but is annoying as hell.
B002XMBVEM|5.0|Love this for destressing at work. Whenever I get keyed up, I listen to Enya. The beautiful music & her angelic voice!
B00005LUR2|5.0|This album is the 80's personified as it features the electronic keyboard style used<br />so much during the 80's.  This album takes me back so many years, and can be electrifying to<br />anyone who lived in the early - mid 80's.  I highly recommend it.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I found this app to be user friendly and full of fun.  Bright colors and large tiles are easy to  choose.
B004LWZW4M|3.0|I chose the &#34; It's okay&#34; rating because, while it is an interesting movie, to anyone who has seen the original series with<br />Charlton Heston, this one may be a let down.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|The movie is great. The book and whole series is great. It's a must see and read! It was a good change of pace too. I wish the ending was a little different but it feels like definately room for the sequel.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This book was okay. I read it very quickly (by my standards). Mainly because it's the kind of book that makes you want to know what happens next. Lots of twists and turns.
0446556750|4.0|Book one and two are great! I hope the trend continues.This is worth your time. I have already given as a gift to two completely different individuals with different interests. They both liked it.
B0013KTGAG|4.0|This movie had an atmosphere similar to 2001: A Space Odyssey.  Although it is a completely different story, it had this almost ethereal feel about it, right down to the computer, except this computer was a little less malevolent.  The most striking feature of the movie was the sense the viewer got of just how powerful the sun is and how we are at its mercy. It left me a little shaken, but sometimes that's a good thing.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It may be a game with simple play but you will spend hours knocking over scientists and collecting coins.  All you do is touch the screen to go up and not touch to go down.  Use that to go around obstacles and collect coins causing mayhem for all the scientists.  Kids love this game.
B0037VNX44|5.0|I couldn't believe it was Tom Hardy when I first began watching this movie. I love him as an actor. He's so versatile. I could watch him in just about anything.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved it! Probably one of the hottest book I have ever read! A book had started a fire in me. :)
B009O07NMA|5.0|Such a GREAT band, I haven't taken the CD out of my car since I bought it 2 months ago.  All the songs are worth listening to over and over again!
B00AYR2FOI|4.0|If you've ever been a fan of Boz Scaggs you'll want to add this to your library.  It will give you that same old feeling.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|This game is very relaxing when you really get into it. A lot of fun. Keep up the good work.
B004132HZS|5.0|i really like mistery.  so when i watched on of the episodes at my father-in-laws house i knew i had to see all of them.  i really like how they kept it really close to the actual book but modernized it.  i think that is doesn't have to be changed at all.  i really loved it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|I've had a particular interest in the special ops teams. The Navy Seals are one of the elite American fighting forces. After reading Marcus Lutrels story in &#34;Last Man Standing&#34; I have become keenly interested in the Seals and the art of Sniping. As a hunter and long range Marksman, this book sheds a lot of light not only on the Iraq war, but the the trials and tribulations of family life of a SEAL or for that matter our military men and women.<br /><br />The book is well written, very worth reading! I bought the book just a few days before Chris Kyle was tragically murdered, so I think it is particularly compelling.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|These DVD's are the Peyton Place of the early twenteth century British aristocracy.  This show grabs your attention and has you wanting more.  I am currently waiting for the fourth season on PBS and will purchase the DVDs when available.  This one is one you will want to see again.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game! So much fun. Challenging and difficult. Good for hand/eye coordination. My daughter downloaded it for her to play....now I'm hooked!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This savy app is good.... love the graphics babbyyy!!!!! it is so fun for horse riders and animal lover's.... for free too babbyyy!!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I love this book. It is better than Twlight! Would love to see it in a movie theater. I hope it will have more series to it.
0062014536|5.0|In Delirium love is found.<br /><br />In Pandemonium love is lost, and found again.<br /><br />In Requiem we see the depth of the world Lauren Oliver created. This: a love song that sometimes is nothing more than a whisper of what you think it should be until you realize the entire time you've been listening to love screaming at you so loud it was only pretending to be quiet. We see love between friends, between strangers. Between people who think they are in love but aren't. Between lovers and parents. Different kinds of loves layer Requiem, so deeply woven together the pieces are sometimes difficult to spot. As it is for so many of Oliver's characters, sometimes we don't even see what love is until it's too late.<br /><br />But it's there. Waiting for the walls to fall, love is there.<br /><br />This trilogy has always been about love. In Delirium Lena finds love. In Pandemonium she finds it again, though a different love is lost. In Requiem she resists. Oliver creates a quiet kind of war built on the platform of a louder one - love upon hate, cured upon uncured. She takes the political and very real aspect of a resistance and layers on love until we are left with a war between those who love and those who don't. Though we get tastes of loudness in Pandemonium and Requiem, Oliver's is a quiet kind of war where the casualties number even more - because they forget. They love and leave and are gone. And underneath this war Oliver has created between the loveless and the lovers, there is this: Lena and Alex and Julian. First loves, second loves, all tied together as one because love is rarely a simple thing. It's never so black and white as we make it. And this trilogy focuses on that, how love is not made up of firsts or seconds or even thirds, but just is.<br /><br />Love stirs jealousy, envy. Happiness and faith and greatness. Love seems unstoppable, and yet it stops from time to time just to breathe, to change. To mold into something different than what it was. And then it's back to this: Love is a force of nature, and in this trilogy it is a character just as real as Lena or Alex. Perhaps even more real.<br /><br />Still, we must remember that this is Lena's story. It is about war, but a different kind of fight. At times, like in Pandemonium, we get the feeling that circumstances and other characters are much bigger than they seem, that we are only seeing a tiny picture in this harsh world of forbidden love. But really, isn't that the point? This is Lena's story. Her loves, her hates. Her eyes seeing her world. And although we hear Hana's voice in the end, it still comes down to this: Lena and the loves she has and doesn't. Her love for Hana and Julian. Her mother. Alex.<br /><br />Her beginning. Her end.<br /><br />But maybe the beginning isn't a place where things just start, but a place where things end and begin again differently than before. Like time, love is deprived of boundaries and borders. It is endless in so many ways. Oliver knows this. She writes this. Which is why Delirium begins in Portland and Requiem ends in Portland.<br /><br />\\"Direction, like time, is a general thing, deprived of boundaries and borders. It is an endless process of interpretation and reinterpretation, doubling back and adjusting.\\"-Requiem<br /><br />Some things never change, some always do. Some even change like whispers on the wind so they're different without even meaning to be. That whisper is what moves the Delirium trilogy along.<br /><br />This: a whisper of the hope of love.<br /><br />This: a requiem of love.<br /><br />This ending is just the beginning. Of life. Of freedom. Of love.<br /><br />Of life beyond the walls.nd then it's back to this: Love is a force of nature, and in this trilogy it is a character just as real as Lena or Alex.

B0044WUQ3G|5.0|This movie feels low budget, but once you get about 20 minutes in the story takes a turn to an hour of sitting on a chair lift footage. I've seen this movie a few times now and you will be yelling at the screen to arguing over how stupid the actions are of the three main characters.<br /><br />If you're looking for a well done thriller, this is not it, but if you're a fan of a watching to see how bad a movie can get this may be the movie for you. Out of 6 people 3 of us thought it was hilarious and the other 3 want the 88 minutes of their lives back.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Sons Of Anarchy is the best TV series I've watched since 24. I hope season 6 is not too far away.
B00AZNEW5G|1.0|I couldn't stand how this movie portrayed the event.  Torture was not a factor and had nothing to do with anything except that they used it to fictionally inject drama into the narrative.  I have other problems with the movie but this is my main concern as people are led to some dangerous conclusions about the intelligence community.  It's sad that the iraq and afghanistan wars do not have any real movies of substance and truth for people to see.  There's enough action if we portray events as they happened.  directors and producers should not feel obligated to inject falsehoods for the sake of creating false drama.
0525953728|5.0|Those who believe BHO did something, they have no idea how the US system works.  The real heroes are those Navy Seals or military people who give their lives to give us freedom.  Obama only takes credit when something like this happen, but he refuses to accept that he is responsible of the bad economy and inept government.

B004X4R3FE|5.0|Such an inspiring true story, with great actors outside  of their usual characters! Great for a stay in movie night!
B008XG1X18|3.0|This completely unnecessary app is nothing more than another way to spend time. I have found plenty of pretty pictures, a few recipes and more of the same plaque of platitude that people keep posting on Facebook. I think interest is about as useful as stumble upon.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Okay so I read this book because my friends have told me how amazing it is, and I have to tell you they weren't lying.
B000ICXQU6|5.0|This movie is a must-see! I can't believe that this is a real story and that a normal individual stood up to start doing something about this!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I loved it, I love it!<br />Every song is fantastic. I love his voice and<br />the marvellous guitar in the songs. I recommend the cd to everyone!
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|The raw passion of the people to give all for their freedom should inspire us all. This movie is a classic.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I have this app on my phone and I love it for the few pages that I run myself. If you have a Facebook page and you're always are on the go download this app for running you pages need
B0012Q732O|5.0|it isn't the best best, but it was really great, i expected it to have more sabertooth tiger to it, but it's still a good movie. it's better than King Kong, i didn't like that one, not very good. but this, oh yeah! i mean cool!
B008LY9AWG|5.0|really enjoy all of his books.  its great to have short stories to read when I am short on time
B008B68J2G|5.0|If your little girl is a Monster High doll and playset collector she will absolutely love the Scaris Caf&eacute; Cart. The set includes an umbrella table, a bench, a chair, and a food cart with awning on wheels. The awning is removable and the wheels actually work, which is a nice feature. There is little assembly required only the bench had to be snapped together. The spider web design of the bright pink, purple, teal, and black furniture simulates wrought iron for the whole Parisian theme. There are lots of little pieces: a coffeemaker accessory, pastry shelf, flower vase, snacks, and drinks. However all of the pieces fit on the two shelves inside the food cart so that's a plus. My 11-year old granddaughter collects Monster High and she loves this set. She put it up on the shelf in her room so she can display her Monster High dolls. This set is cute and fun and affordable. A perfect addition to the Monster High collection.
B0095P31L6|5.0|the kids loved the movie and it worked perfect. watched during a doctors appoinment...made it worth the wait in the waiting room.
B0079KGAOY|4.0|Beware -- the description from amazon for the first movie talks of the Director's Cut.  NONE of them 4 featured here are Extended Director's Cuts.  I bought this box (One day deal of $35) so I know what I have.<br /><br />Do the research folks.  If you want the Theatrical editions then buy this.  Otherwise, get the DTS DVDs or Wait until yet another box is put out for sale.<br /><br />All 4 films are very entertaining.  Just buyer beware.  and Amazon...Please correct your product descriptions.
B001DCQI8W|5.0|To adapt Confucius, performing Bruckner poses the same difficulties as cooking a small, delicate fish.  Not that Bruckner's symphonies are small or delicate -- anyone who has listened to them knows they are broad, bold, expansive, ambitious.  It's that they are so easy to overcook or undercook.  I've heard too much of both in other recordings of Bruckner's symphonies:  the slow, grave parts (say, movement II of symphony VII) die of languor, the big, loud parts (say, from movement III of symphony IV) rupture in unrestrained bombast.<br /><br />But Karajan and the Berlin Philharmonic get these spot on.  I have remarked elsewhere that Karajan has a habit of restraint that doesn't work well with other scores, but it is absolutely essential with these.  The slow never gets too slow:  motion and pace are always apparent; the fast never gets too fast:  nothing gallops away.  The same can be said for dynamics, phrasing, and attack -- everything is done with a sense of control and purpose, and the result is a set of performances that reveal the real majesty of Bruckner's symphonies.<br /><br />I have especial praise for the brass performers from this set:  they play with a clarity, yet also a warmth, that is noticeable throughout.  All too often, clear brass playing is cold, and warm brass playing is fuzzy.  A long retired trumpet and horn player like me is left to wonder how they pulled it off.<br /><br />The only downside is that several of the symphonies are split across more than one CD, and the symphonies are not presented in sequential order.  That's a bit awkward when I'm looking to play just one of them that is so split.<br /><br />I leave to others the many musicologists' arguments about how many symphonies Bruckner actually wrote (there is a piece called number 0) and which versions are authoritative -- in the end, the music director has to choose one or the other, and I'm pleased with Karajan's choices and direction.<br /><br />I've listened through this set several times now and look forward to enjoying it for some time to come.al times now and look forward to enjoying it for some time to come.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I think this game is totally better than the first it has better graphics better sound  really baisclly it has better everything
B007VUA7VO|5.0|it dosent only monitor it. it saves your battery too.when it is charging its saves and it is way faster.
0143118757|4.0|I bought this book as part of an negotiations class I was taking at a local college.  The author presents a wonderful system for working through negotiations in a win-win way while also providing details on how to work with difficult people or situations.  The book is applicable far beyond the classroom and my job - it's a great way to take a new attitude even for personal situations - such as buying a car!
B000GCFBQU|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  At times I was anxious for the end, but it was so well written, that I knew she would have a good ending.  A great story anyone who has had ups and downs in their life can relate to.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|I love this book from the analytics side of things.  While a nice story line, the true beauty of the book is the way that baseball SHOULD have used stats in the past - instead owners fall all over themselves to sign mediocre players.
B008CPZNL6|3.0|I still have not read anything on this magazine,but it's on my kindle fire, I will have to check it out
B008M0NDOK|1.0|only for very few games. i&#34;s not very useful, because it&#34;s good for only few games. It&#34;s not enough. That is all
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I loved this book! The way it's written...back and forth between the past and present made it a little confusing at first and I had to go back and re-read a little paying close attention to the dates but it was well worth it! The characters were well developed and the suspense level was great. I will immediately by her next book as this was the most enjoyable book I've read lately.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Best headset ever.  Does a great job on voice recognition as well as VOIP. I use it for business daily
B008TRUDAS|5.0|One of the worst things that can happen to a teenager is to have them move away from all of their friends, to a new place where they know no-one. This happen to Layken shortly after the unexpected death of her father. Her neighbor Will tragically lost both of his parents in an accident and is now raising his younger brother on his own. There is no denying their attraction, and the connection that they share is instantaneous.....Until they realize that they can't be together, WHICH SUCKS!!!! I felt so bad for these two! Having someone who could make you so happy be unattainable is almost cruel! There were times where Will annoyed me with his mixed signals.... But I understood, he had to put himself first and his brother. This was a tortuously sweet read. I'm hooked on this series, I need to know exactly what happens with them!!! Thank God I can buy Point of Retreat right now and start reading!<br /><br />Here's my favorite line:<br /><br />\\"I used to love the ocean, everything about her. All the beautiful? It's not real, it's fake.... So you keep your Ocean, I'll take the Lake\\"<br />Please read this book!!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I know I can find out how much battery power you have left in the settings of the Kindle fire HD but I really like the fact this app breaks down the information according to tasks. I also really like the fact it tells you how long in minutes until the kindle is fully charged. I tried the free app first and then bought the pro version.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|&#34;Before I Go to Sleep&#34; kept me from sleeping many nights, because I had to keep reading to find out what happened when Christine woke up.  I love books that keep me guessing, hoping things will turn out ok, and sometimes aghast at the turns they take.  This book lives up to that.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|_<br />This game has quickly become very adicting. I cant seem to stop. but its one of those games where you have to do a lot of waiting around
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|My daughter absolutely LOVES this movie.  Can't say enough good things about this classic movie.  I recommend it any parent with kids.
B007VUA7VO|2.0|I love that the app gives you an overall percentage of battery life plus gives you hours for different kindle uses like standby, video, reading, music, and online browsing.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|This movie is played over and over again at my house.  My 3 year old can recite it from memory.  LOVE LOVE LOVE!!
B000000OF6|5.0|I also grew up with this band.  I got this as a reminder of the music from when I was a teen. I already have the others but this one I wanted to leave in my car when I want some of the older rock.  Love it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|An incredibly well written page turner. Having watched the history of Apple play out in the media, it was fascinating to read about the power plays behind the scenes.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love the Big Bang!  I have the whole set and I find them so funny and each character play their parts so well.  Just the thought of trying to be Sheldon and perfect is so good.  I don't know anyone that doesn't like it.  Comedy is a fantastic tool for depression or just needed a good laugh.  I hope it stays on the air a little longer.  Who knows, because they are getting older.  I am glad I have the set.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Sleek, intuitive layout. Reliable and a pleasure to use. Great for travel, home, or office. Easy to use features. Weather, multiple alarms, etc. I recommend it!!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|I love the Big Bang!  I have the whole set and I find them so funny and each character play their parts so well.  Just the thought of trying to be Sheldon and perfect is so good.

B004G6009K|5.0|Tangled is a cute show and the 3-D version was a treat. Having all the versions gives you flexibility on where you can play it, so you can take it with you and show to friends no matter what system they have.
B006YXKLV0|5.0|I bought this for my niece.  She has always like the chipmunks.  I thought she should have the dvd's for a small collection that she has.  Now since she can watch them, she won't play the Xmas record from many years ago that I had when I was little.  Kids love these so why not make them happy and they are very cute.
B008WCP2PG|2.0|Based on the marketing and the interviews I had seen with actors in the cast, I was expecting something upbeat, funny, but it was dark and depressing and sleazy...
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is an awesome movie.  As usual Sandra Bullock is fantastic!  There is such a good story to this movie.  If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do.  Very heart warming and the whole movie just flows together so well.  An awesome part for Sandra to play.  If there were actresses to do this movie, it would have to be Sandra Bullock or Julia Roberts.
B000I186FW|5.0|Great hero figure, unique storyline, awesome damsel in distress; its perfect!  It is my absolute favorite movie now.  I started with DVD, then bought Blue Ray disks for myself and a friend of mine.
B004EPZ03O|5.0|Who ever said that you can't be an adult and love the muppets.  I love them!  I have every single one of them.  For me, it wouldn't be right not to have the whole set.  They are great!
B002RV01QI|5.0|As a casual fan of Enya, I was thoroughly satisfied with this album.  I usually download most music these days, but I bought this CD because her style has a purity of sound that demanded CD quality.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I have the whole set of the Harry Potter.  I love it.  All the characters are awesome.  Could you imagine having powers and going to that school of Hogworts.  I think it would be a riot.  I give Daniel Radcliffe a 2 thumbs up on this series.  Seeing him grow up in front of us, I thought it was great!  Now also on Broadway, the sky is the limit for Daniel.  Great job!!!
B008Y6TE5O|1.0|Is anyone else having troubles with their prime streaming?  I use a Roku and Netflix works almost flawlessly.  Amazon Prime, however, completely bugs out whenever I try to pause and replay a movie.
B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movie was done so well and I can see why it took so long to make.  Everything in this movie is moving to the mind and I give the producers a perfect 10 for this movie.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|If you like crime dramas that take place in LA, this is a must see.  Like Mann's other classic LA crime drama, &#34;Heat,&#34; &#34;Collateral&#34; delivers a compelling story with superb acting.  This is one of the best performances of Cruise's career.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I love the Big Bang!  I have the whole set and I find them so funny and each character play their parts so well.  Just the thought of trying to be Sheldon and perfect is so good.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a pretty fun game. The only thing I don't like are all the adds that pop up and how long it takes to get coins.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  I think I have watched it 3 or 4 times now.  It doesn't seem to matter how many times I have seen it, I always find something else I didn't get from before.  Colin Firth is an incredible actor.  I thought he was the right person for the part.
0316056898|5.0|To me, Tine Fey is a celebrity par-excellence.  Her memoir is more of a conversation about whatever is on her mind.  Doesn't write a lot about herself or the celebrity people she has known.  More about her observations of the human comedy.  More about how we should all treat each other.  More about being good than being famous or successful.  I liked it a lot.  Ms. Fey  does a great job portraying herself as someone we would want as a work mate or a friend.  She sold me.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|If you thought Temple Run 2 was great then wait till you play the Oz version. The familiar endless running game reaches to new heights (literally with balloons!!) in OZ. A delightful game with amazing graphics, ballons and the flying baboons. A must have for a temple run fan!
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I had an alfa years ago.worked great.this one didnt do any good at all.1 bar on singnal 1000 ft away.sent it back for return.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I have watched this and enjoyed seeing the UK version as well as the PBS. Looking forward to future episodes.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Really enjoyed it. Couldn't put it down. Well written, funny, sad and truthful. Like able and relatable characters. Well done.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Sweet free app.  Easy to use with nice features.  I may buy it for the music.  Now to find a stand for my night stand.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Exciting and insightful in parts. I liked where it finally went. I was interested because I heard about the film adaptation coming up. I'm curious to see how they pull that off.
1118156307|4.0|This looks like a long and dense book, but I read it over a weekend. It's heavy on the research methods, less so on philosophy and the history of service design.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The story was very surprising and I was engaged from the first page. At first I tought this was a ordinary love story, then it took a twist, and I could hardly do anything else before I had finished the book.
0307454568|5.0|Great reading, you will not want to put this book down. Stieg Larsson holds your attention to the point of great expectation of the next page.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fine. passes time.<br />keeps me busy when waiting and it keeps you looking g forward for rewards.<br />like I said its fine
0307742539|4.0|It continues the entwined stories of a Swedish journalist and a disturbed but talented young woman. There's no way a sequel can hang on to the discovery and excitement of a first novel (5 stars) but it still captures the suspense around this mismatched couples interactions.
B00BFUUMO8|1.0|I hate to have to wait. This isn't a game I want to play because everything takes to long to reset. Trying to upgrade  1 dinosaur took thousands of coins!!!!! If I have to log on ten time to progress a tiny bit not worth it.
B0064T6LV8|2.0|Flippers difficult to use. Very little action not  Very exciting.  Very boring. Poorly designed. What else can I say. Ok
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|It is glitchy when it came to the dark forrest, I eventually did get it todownload for my ki dle hd and my I phone. It also gets a little boring after a while, but it is pretty to look at and I hope they'll add more characters as time goes on.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|We've always been big fans of Criminal Minds. We love it just as much as we loved season one. Watching it on Amazon Instant Video has been wonderful!
B005CA4SJW|5.0|Great to have especially for those Walking Dead Parties. Can't wait to get the rest of the series so that I can watch them whenever I want
0307341577|4.0|Libby survived her family's murder only to become an adult who never learned how to be an adult.  After going through the trust fund created after the outpoor of the public's sympathy money, she becomes involved with the Kill Club, a group of people who are obsessed with famous murder; everything from 20th century Fanny Adams to modern crimes.  She wants money from the Kill Club and is finally able to look into her family's deaths.<br />The chapters are based on Libby current life and investigation, her mother Patty's day of the murder, and Ben (her brother convicted of the killings and sent to jail) th day of the story.  I like the alternativing POV style.  I liked that the reveal behind the murders had been built up to hinted at, and it's not a simple \\"who it was this guy\\" revolution.  I wasn't as drawn in and interested as \\"Gone Girl\\", but, it's still a good book. I would definitely recommend.
B008OOYALE|3.0|i love most of the &quot;story&quot; games and dragon story is good but it needs improvement. the wait times are soooo long. people cant get invested in something that you cant play. once you wait to breed your dragons you have to wait for the egg to hatch, there should be a way t abandon the egg instead of having to hatch it. also the food is really hard to grow. then you have the issue of expanding...super expensive and hard to do. its  a fun game but i prefer bakery story, you actually get to play the game.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|The wrong cable was sent.  It doesn't fit my Kindle.  I have 1st edition Kindle and the custmer service rep told me this cable would work
B00009ZYBY|5.0|This is a great movie with plenty of action. Russell Crowe is just out standing in this movie and I think it is one of his best.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I enjoyed it when it was in the movie; had to have it in my collection of very good family films
B000UZQI0Q|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  It's the second in the mistborn series and highly addictive. I read the first one in paper back and once I got my kindle it was the first book I purchased. I would recommend for anyone who  like sci-fi.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game is alot of fun. Graphics are well done. I am buying the full version. I recommend this game
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I bought two and wind up returning both as neither would charge my kindles at all, nor any other devices that work with the same type of cord.
B000002UB2|5.0|I bought this for my stepson who is a huge Beatles fan.  He's only 9 so I didn't want to spend too much on his gift.  I found this vinyl for a great price.  I check the price since I bought it and it is triple what I paid.  It was his favorite gift.  I'm so happy I bought it for him.
B002UTKSBK|5.0|To this day this is still an amazing album! Howard Shore does an amazing job of creating music I never get tired of listening to.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Liked this book but didn't really like the ending. I wish that they would have at least brought them back from Colorado. But l in all different type of love story.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like how you can have multiple alarms. I like how there is a ton different settings. You can change the sound, the amount of snoozes you get, saga nd which alarms get math to snooze. Overall a great app!
B000N6U0E2|2.0|I wanted to like this - was first engaging - good acting - but the plot is too predictable and somewhat boring - I did manage to more or less watch the whole thing but would not recommend it. It's at best an average movie. It does show some genuine human emotions which is nice.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|I really enjoyed Papillon-the thrilling and heartbreaking story of an escapee, victim of the French penal system off the coast of South America. Its great from beginning to end. The seller did a great job, quick and speedy shipping.
0756405890|5.0|This is a really great book!!! It was recommended by a friend, and I wasn't so sure I would like it... especially for the first 2 chapters or so, but keep on reading!! NotW gets so much better after the story picks up.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is awesome you should play it its fun and cool hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi hi
B009UZLRJE|5.0|So glad I purchased the box set. Great deal for anyone who loves Big Bang Theory. You won't be sorry :)
B004LWZWGA|4.0|Great movie, i feel like it was missing something. Not sure, i guess that one moment in a movie where the good guy and bad guy go at it and your cheering for the good guy. It sorta happened when he (spoiler alert) climbed out the prison which was cool. Great scoring by Hans Zimmer. Great performances by the whole cast. Great movie.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|It took their relationship to the final  level.  However, I am aghast that a young girl just out of college would be so terribly naive initially.
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Might just be my own personal style doesn't work well with the suggestions.  Will come back to it another time and see if I find it more helpful later.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|bought for a grand daughter who requested it and sshe is very happy with itmake the geand kids happy yes
1616550414|5.0|So happy, i love it.. so much more than I expected. Learned so much, and it is beautiful. It is a must bay.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|the first season was blemished due to being so gory  2nd season was less gory abd more suspensful loved it
B003V1WTMM|5.0|Prefered the Secret Keeper, but again, very well written, The author's descriptions are vivid. The story line always has a few unexpected twists.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|thought the first season was a bit gory however just fini the second season and found ii very very good
B000VLE3GA|5.0|Vinyl Review<br /><br />I own and have owned multiple copies of all the Led Zep albums.  I have 1-6 in their original pressings.  While the music was great on the original disks, the later discs were flimsy and iffy...especially Physical Graffiti, with the subsequent unevenness of the sound, tone and color of the music.<br /><br />The new mastering has done wonders to unshackle the music and allow the detail to come to the fore.  Sound stage is broader, not as brassy and less muddy...totally richer.... This is what I have wanted to hear every since I bought Led Zep 3 as a kid in Singapore.  Vocals and Guitar are clear, correct and balance well with Bonham's wonderful overuse of the cymbals and high hats!<br /><br />Worth every penny... Long live vinyl!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I never wanted to see a movie about blue people until this one came out in 3D at the theaters.  Then I had to have the blu-ray but it was very expensive.  Glad the price finally came down within my reach.  The effects are a great addition!
B000000OU0|5.0|Excellent songs with an excellent band. Doesn't get much better than that. I have nothing more to comment oabout this quality CD.
B004I8WLK2|4.0|If anyone had read the comments before publishing them, they would have known it was for another book. Please show more respect for your own publishing exercise if not for your customers. I had never commented an Amazon book before and promise not to do it again.
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|Sweet, innocent, child-like Arthur is not respected around the north pole. His older brother is expected to step up and take the role of Santa when their father retires, but, a child has been missed. How will it be handled? Does anyone care? Is this truly important? Should Santa be concerned with such a minor number as 1 missed out of so many successful deliveries all over the world?<br /><br />Watch and see what happens. A very fun adventure!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game has a wide variety of quarter horses and unicorns. it could have other breeds such as friesions and Arabians. it is very interactive and the horse sounds are realistic as well.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app! It is addicting. If you love the original Temple Run, I guarantee you will LOVE this one. Goinv through mines are my favorite thing to do. I think Temple Run 2 is Awesome!!
B0067R0APK|4.0|Would like to see the hourly forecast since it is a platinum edition; but it is just fine and gives me what I need for now.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|This CD is fantastic and I love pretty much every single song! I highly recommend this album. Give it a listen!
0062014536|5.0|I loved it.  will buy all the other books in this series and read them.  This is a great series

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Linden Sky Davis finds herself &#34;completely and comfortably numb&#34;, then along comes Dean Holder. He's intense and makes her feel once again. It's terrifying and exciting, but when Sky discovers Holder knows more about her than she does, her world suddenly comes crashing down. <br /><br />I know it's going to be a long review but there's so much that needs to be said. So I'll try but I feel like there are no words adequate enough to describe how I feel about this book. It felt like I was on a rollercoaster and I loved every bit of it- the ups and downs. I felt like Sky and Holder because I experienced so many &#34;firsts&#34; with this book. It was the first time I had the need to contact the author, the first time I couldn't bring myself to finish it because it pained me to have to part, and the first time I was left speechless.<br /><br /> I was emotionally invested with the story and characters. Never have I formed such a connection with a character none the less two from the same book. I had such a strong urge to protect them, and gosh, how I felt their pain. They were so imperfect and so real. Sky's strong and brave, yet so fragile and broken. She has a dark and troubled past, and that's putting it mildly. The stuff she had to endure and go through was heart-wrenching. Holder. *sigh* He's just pure perfection. He's intense and endearing. I loved his ego-busting texts. I definitely need some of those. I think anyone who finishes Hopeless will find their lives lacking without a Holder. <br /><br />My heart broke multiple times, but it was mended more times than it was broken. I'm jealous of those who get to experience Hopeless for the first time. And I recommend it to anyone looking for a dark, gut-wrenching beautiful story.

1250012570|5.0|Eleanor & Park is a very powerful read.  Not in that it's an issue book (though there are issues addressed) but that it's a realistic look at teenagers and their lives.  Eleanor is a normal girl, only not normal because she has things so, so bad.  She's also a plus size girl and has crazy wild red hair and she's picked on.  She comes from a dysfunctional family (really dysfunctional) and has to deal with a lot.  And Park is your somewhat average teenage boy with two normal parents (though his mother is Korean, which kind of presents some problems in Park's eyes) who love each other still (hard to find) but with a father who has a hard time accepting him as he is, always wanting a bit more.  It shows us that yes, Eleanor has real issues and has to deal with a lot and Park's issues are nothing in comparison, but they are still the things he has to deal with and it's still tough.<br /><br />You've probably already heard a lot about this book.  I bought it because of the reviews and I read it almost the moment it arrived in my mailbox.  It was a very emotional read that really brought back a lot those teenage emotions.  I also felt so much anger at the stuff Eleanor had to go through.  But I loved the very sweet and unique romance between these characters.  I have never read anything like it and it was absolutely beautiful.<br /><br />Honestly, all I can really say now is that this is a must read.  Everyone's saying that, and it's for good reason.  It's beautiful, powerful and extremely good.  This is a book that every teenager should read, there's stuff in it that nearly everyone can relate to and connect with.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Purchased this series as a gift for my Brother-in-law.  Both he and my sister (not a comic book type at all) were hooked and watched it all the way through over a matter of a month or so.  Highly recommend this series to anyone.

B00AB0AR2U|2.0|I'm a diehard fan of all things RE but this was painful to watch. Seriously, those glasses? What was that? And the storyline made no sense and had me so lost. What about all the characters from the previous movie? The one cool thing was that more game characters were included, but they got Leon all wrong.

B004X6PRO6|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son is not a happy book. At the same time it has humor. It is a fiction while also being true-to-life. It contains many such dichotomies. Great beauty, also human ugliness. Kindness and cruelty. Sanity and gross insanity. It reflects the current state of irresponsible governments and leaders whoever they are and wherever they are located. The people's responses to their conditions throughout their lives are portrayed with an honesty that hurts.<br /><br />It's an important book. Superbly crafted. Intense. Gifted. Harrowing. Horrifying. And possibly, redemptive.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down. I'd heard that it would grab the reader and not let go. That was 100% true from my experience.
0345529057|5.0|I am really looking forward to reading these after I finish the book I'm currently reading. I was surprised at how heavy each book is. The paper is thinner than I'm used to but excellent quality. And with the thinner paper the number of pages in each book is amazing, and the weight of the whole set is deceiving as well. Approximately 4000 pages total!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Not every book is made for everyone.  You either love it or hate it.  I loved it!  On to book Three!
1402786360|5.0|I find it hard to pick up this book and not immediately begin drooling. Page after page of beautifully photographed sugary goodness. Every baker's dream - easy to follow, tasty, and aesthetically lovely. Highly recommend!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved the 1st and 2nd books.  Loved this one too. Once again, this book isn't for everyone.  But if you're reading a review on Book Three of the Trilogy, then you've already crossed over to the dark side and there's no sense of reading a review NOW, lol.  These books are not meant to gain an intellectual understanding of the universe.  They're meant to relax your mind, let your imagination wander a little bit, and enjoy a fantasy sexual adventure from the point of view of a young, inexperienced woman. The end.
B0026OR1UK|5.0|One of the best books about talent development I have read.  I especially liked the variety of skills described using similar techniques from all over the world.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Totally enjoyed every minute of it...Could not stop watching...Had to watch the entire season on a Sunday afternoon...It was very addictive...
1476729719|5.0|Nineteen Minutes is a book I read as part of a book club and I could not stop reading at the allotted chapters!  It is a page-turner that leaves you emotionally invested in the characters even after you put down the book.  I found myself constantly changing who I was rooting for.  I am a pre-service teacher in graduate school and after the recent shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in CT, I was left haunted.  I accepted the ending of the book with a heavy heart and newfound concern for my future students.<br /><br />We are constantly reminded that every victim has a family and friends left with a beloved person missing from their lives.  However, Nineteen Minutes reminds us all that every shooter also has a mother and a father and connections of their own left to grieve.  Jodi Picoult paints the even more complicated picture of being the family member of the alleged shooter and the toll it takes. This book captures the raw emotions and reactions of friends, girlfriends, parents, teachers, and community members effected by the repercussions of a school shooting.  This book certainly sheds new light on the profile of a school shooter.  Picoult leaves you with a new understanding of the unspoken atrocities occurring in schools.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of it.  Could not stop watching highly recommend...Great way to bond with spouse...Time period right on the money...

B0042C1BP0|1.0|I had heard from a friend that the latest installment of Casino Royal would make me a Bond fan again. Boy, was he wrong. The things, to me, that made bond films of the 60s 70s and even 80s great was the humor in terms of the over-the-top villains, elaborate hide outs, and male/female interaction. Todays Bond has none of that charm and wonder. Instead, the films are just like any other another action movie with a lot of stuff being blown up all the while advertising the latest car, cell phone, or computer.  Really really awful.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing she put so much character in this book then she ever Has I couldn't put this book down

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I was not expecting this book to be so good, it was a hard book to put down as I wanted to find out how it was going to end. I just hope the writer has more books in him.

0316224588|5.0|Eighteenth in the Detective Inspector Rebus mystery series revolving around ex-DI Rebus in Edinburgh while being third in the Inspector Malcolm Fox mystery series revolving around Rebus' nemesis in the Complaints.<br /><br />My Take<br />I was so not expecting Rankin to pop up with another Rebus book...and I am absolutely thrilled that he did. Rebus had retired in [[ASIN:0316099279 Exit Music (Inspector Rebus, #17)]], back in 2007, and Rankin has him popping back up as a civilian working with the cold case squad. There's just a hint of possibility that Rebus may get taken back now that they raised the retirement age...and from the work Rebus does in this story, the Edinburgh police would be nuts not to take him. I am definitely curious as to which way Siobhan ends up swinging. She's had a bit of time in which to see Page operate, and now it's back to Rebus' free wheeling methods which end in results. Hmmm...<br /><br />It is interesting that Rankin's newest series, Malcolm Fox, intersects with this. As the names Tony and Joe Naysmith cropped up, I couldn't figure out why they sounded so familiar until I was checking my notes. Uh-huh, it will be interesting to see what pops in the fourth Malcolm Fox. And if there's a nineteenth Rebus!<br /><br />Rankin has certainly left the possibilities open for it.  <br /><br />This particular story leaves me wondering if Rebus is right and it is just ego that's got Fox ticked off. Especially when there's such ground opening up under other policemen who should be investigated. Tony definitely has his own questions about Fox's obsession. Another interesting venue to explore.<br /><br />The new bad guy whom Rankin has introduced is a new complication, and I'll be curious to see what Rebus, Clarke, and Cafferty do about him.<br /><br />I can see where Complaints would be concerned about a cop hobnobbing with a crook, but then again, where else are the cops going to get information?<br /><br />Oh man, Rebus does have fun with DCI James Page with Led Zeppelin song titles.<br /><br />Really, it was pretty stupid of Hammell to be so trusting with someone whose family he's screwed over. Then there's Dempsey's attitude. Gimme a break. She's equating Rebus with every other Tom, Dick, or Harry calling in with tips? When he's the one who broke it?<br /><br />You can't help but love Rebus for all his drinking when he's the one out getting things accomplished while those above him are more worried about camera face-time, playing groupie, and lunching with the higher-ups. That and he's taking the piss out of everyone! It's a different sort of business-as-usual with Rebus, and we're the richer for it.<br /><br />The Story<br />It's a colder case than usual that finds Rebus pushing people's bells. One that will tear the socks off a variety of participants and leave Rebus questioning what he truly wants.<br /><br />The Characters<br />RETIRED Detective Inspector (DI) John Rebus is working in Serious Crime Review Unit (SCRU), the cold case squad, as a civilian and still enjoying his music. His daughter, Samanatha, is either shacked up or married to Keith, and they're trying to get pregnant.<br /><br />The cops at Gayfield Square in Edinburgh include:<br />DI Siobhan Clarke is doing well for herself. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) James Page is all for first names and looking good for the cameras. He's also doing Siobhan. Other cops include Ronnie Ogilvie, Detective Constable (DC) Christine Esson is their computer person, and DC Dave Ormiston has a bit going on the side.<br /><br />Fellow retired cops in SCRU<br />Hmmm, do you think there's a hidden message in that acronym? Detective Sergeant (DS) Daniel Cowan is in charge, and he's one of those more interested in his own progress rather than case progress. Retired DC Elaine Robison and retired DI Peter Bliss work away at the cases along with Rebus.<br /><br />The Complaints<br />Inspector Malcolm Fox wants too badly to catch Rebus at anything while Tony Kaye has his doubts and Joe Naysmith is just along for the ride.<br /><br />The cops at Northern include:<br />DCS Gillian Dempsey is reckoned to be brilliant. Gavin Arnold is a flexible cop, even if he's not so hot at darts.<br /><br />Nina Hazlitt is bugging Rebus about her daughter Sally who went missing along the A9 back in 1999. Other missing persons include Zoe Beddows.<br /><br />Annette McKie is the latest to go missing. Her mum, Gail McKie, is devastated. Fortunately, another crime boss, Frank Hammell, is in the wings to support her. Derek Christie is Gail's ex. Darryl Christie is their eighteen-year-old son, Annette's older brother. A very quiet, observant lad with big plans. Joseph and Cal are the younger brothers.<br /><br />DI Gregor Magrath retired some years ago after he started up the Serious Crime Review Unit. Kenny Magrath is his brother and an electrician; Maggie is his loyal wife.<br /><br />Cafferty is still around and kicking, even though he's \\"retired\\".

B006LSZECO|5.0|I don't often give out five stars, but to find myself so engrossed in a love story that suddenly turns in on itself and morphs into something new and twisted, yet believable was a real surprise.  This author has the ability to write about clever people capable of extended mind games. This was a real find. Enjoy!
B002U5HKZ6|5.0|This book is a heartbreaking triumph of the human spirit. I will read it again and then again. Bravo Linbaba.
B0044IABFS|5.0|Really enjoyed this entire series.  Action from season one to season four.  Wish there were a few more seasons, but you can only break out of prison for so long.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I've read all the Grisham books, and this one was interesting, easy to read, and had the typical complex plan that needed to be executed. The only disappointment was that there was no surprise ending.
0446615625|4.0|Baldacci's thriller rambles, and sometimes veers into needless exaggeration (e.g., a practically super-human American spy). But what sets it apart is its profoundly creative plot.
0143120530|5.0|Moonwalking with Einstein is a fascinated one. Joshua Foer has successfully explained the essence of memory to his audience from different aspects; such as what memory is, what functions does it serves and how significant it could be through his own experience. What's more, from Foer, I also learned that \\"if there is a will, there is a way.\\" Foer's efforts on memory have made him the winner of the US Memory Championship. Nevertheless, besides all the secrets he reveals, there are still a lot of mysteries remains. Therefore, the further we explore on the journey of memory, the more we would harvest. I highly recommend this book to you.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Good Grisham read, you get all his clever and 'secret' plan that inevitably works out. However, as I sorta read the acknowledgements at then end I realized this WAS a very lazy book.  he's done better.  None the less, it's a fast and fun read.  No spoilers from me, sorry
B005PK56TA|4.0|If you like bizarre strange horror movies then you will love this.  It was like driving past a bad car wreck.  You don't want to see but you can't look away!
B005WYFLNU|5.0|What a great solution for a kid who loves stickers, but constantly wants to reposition them!  My daughter kept getting so frustrated with stickers that lost their sticky-ness!  Not any more!  She love this sticker pad and has so much fun with it!  I would recommend using it with either an older or more mature child because it can be difficult for them to peel them off the paper and everything.  My daughter is 2 and does well with them, but I do have to help her with them a good bit at getting them off the page.<br />But it's a great produce and very cute pictures!

B008XG1X18|4.0|If you love pinterest, you'll like this app. However, the version for Kindle Fire does NOT have the &quot;scroll to top&quot; feature and it is kind of annoying!
B0083GQKQG|2.0|Most of this film was wasted on images of red things (ketchup, tomato soup cans, tomato sauce, etc. We get it...something horrible happens), random gratuitous sex scenes, and Tilda Swinton's character stumbling through life dealing with a mentally ill child (that no one else believes is mentally ill).  Excellentl portrayal by Swinton, but there is actually little of Kevin in the film.  This movie could have been a powerful display of how Reactive Attachment Disorder (if that is what the diagnosis is) effects families.  Instead, we are left to wonder &#34;What's with the tomatoes?&#34;
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I literally could not put this book down. It was gripping, riveting and extremely fast paced. Hard to believe this was the authors first novel.

B008J05EL8|1.0|Why do I have to get this package? Why doesn't it just come with OfficeSuite Pro?  This is just a cheap little trick to get a few more bucks. I'd given it up front, but whittling away does not enhance my respect of the product.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I'm an avid PC gamer and I've used a variety of mice for productivity and game play.<br />After using this mouse, I have to say that the product is great.<br /><br />In my opinion, here are the pros:<br />The mouse is good looking, sturdy, intuitively designed and a good grip/platform for my hand.<br />The 9 buttons are responsive when you click them and don't feel cheap or sluggish in response.<br />Also, with the exception to one or 2, the buttons are well placed overall.<br />The programmable software is very simple to use.<br />8000 dpi for the price is really really great!<br />Switchable profiles are useful since I have one profile saved for gaming buttons and another for my media productivity.  (This is where color coding your Anker LED icon actually pays off.)<br /><br />My cons (mostly small stuff):<br />Adjustable weights are a nice feature, but for this product it seems negligible.  I think you either use all the weights in the mouse or don't use any.  I have them all in to help keep it sturdy.<br />LED effects with the Anker icon can get annoying to me...thank goodness it can be shut off via the software.<br />No disk with drivers or software are included with the mouse.  You must download them from their website in order to have the proper drivers, program your buttons, dpi and LED color schemes.<br />Once installed, the programmable software is always up and running.  You will see it as a standard part of your start-up process and will leave an icon on your taskbar. You cannot minimize it to a background application or keep it hidden.<br /><br />Overall, this is a great mouse for the price and kudos to Anker for making such a nice mouse!!  It's a solid piece of equipment and I've been using it constantly now for a month with no major complaints. I would recommend it to my gaming buddies.

6305508550|4.0|From laughing that is.  I never tire of &#34;Office Space&#34;.  A cult classic that never dissappoints.  Ron Livingston and Gary Cole are absolutely hysterical.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it has awesome. graphics great fun it it is better than at other game. it has good competition on fb
B00005Y6YB|5.0|product was perfect. love this story line. glad to have found it here. a gift to my husband. definitely a keeper.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|good game so far.  I do need to get used to the buttons. it is so much like Mario brothers.
B0081SPK0I|3.0|This is a nice retro style racing game.  Reminds me of the old arcade games from years ago.  Good time waster!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I already had the entire series on DVD and wanted them on blu-ray.  Especially glad that the collection included &#34;The Plan&#34;, as well.  It arrived in excellent condition and on time!

B003YL4LYI|5.0|I thought this book would wrap up the story. Of course not.  Still a great read, though. Highly recommend it.
B00992CF6W|1.0|I love Minecraft as much as the next guy, but $7 for a really crappy rendition of it? Why? This is the kind of 2 dollar game that you only use to show off to your friends. So why does it cost so much?
1616550414|5.0|This book is great is even bigger than i though it was i hope for more items like this one.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|After I watched Argo I understood why it won best picture at the Academy Awards.  This really is a great film and the real life suspense surrounding that situation translates to viewer effortlessly.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Interesting game. Holds my sons attention for hours. The animation is cool too! Was very simple to download as well.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is the best and free I showed my older brother and he freaked out he just started screaming
B00BBW16HW|5.0|I rarely ever give reviews.  Usually things just don't impress me enough to go through the trouble but here I am reviewing this movie.  I absolutely loved it.  The relationship between these two men is amazing and clearly what they each needed.  If only we could all have someone like that in our lives, this will be a much happier world.  In case you aren't aware, the movie is in French, there are English subtitles.
B009E3EYS8|4.0|For nostalgic listeners like me, even though I prefer the studio recordings. The quality of the vidoe and audio are superb.
B0094K1QR8|5.0|So nice to have a feel good movie. I love Ashton  in all his movies he really is better than two and a half men
B005OT2YVA|3.0|This movie has the same feel as the first two. The story line is that of a kids cartoon series, so I guess that pretty much sums it up. I was entertained while watching it, so it was okay. I gave it three stars because it was entertaining, but not much else. No deep thoughts go into this story, character development is pretty weak, special effects are very good.
B000NI9UMS|5.0|This movie is very good. My husband and I were glad that we watched. I highly recommend your viewing! Awesome.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome to play. If you can get it you wont be bored with it<br />So get it while you can I THINK this is awesome to play
B004498KPU|5.0|Awesome! Wearing it out? Can i get a discount on a 2nd? Good quality videos and sound. packaging is neat!
B006O3MU96|5.0|This game is so addictive and fun to play! Must have for any smartphone! Get this game now! Really fun!
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Great package and contents! Quality of the video is great and I love the intro with the fans before the concert
0316067598|5.0|There are quite a few books about the Navy Seals but this is one of the most compelling survivor stories I've ever read - right up there with &#34;Unbreakable&#34;.  Once you get started you won't be able to put it down - my wife is finishing it as I write this and she felt the same way.  I hope the movie coming out this fall does it justice.  It really helped understand not only the commitment, sacrifice and bravery of the Navy Seals but also the history of the conflict with the Taliban in Afghanistan.  I bought a copy for my brother and my son.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|What an awesome show! One I wish I could have seen in person!<br />Good quality and sound. Love the intro!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|This was suggested to me by a friend that had read about the life story of Rodriguez in the newspaper. I was not influenced by the incredible story in itself since I listened for the first time before reading it. This was a huge surprise! The lyrics are still updated so the same type of questions keep coming. The music is superb.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|I have been a Nicole Conn fan since I first laid eyes on her work. Elena Undone is in my opinion her finest work to date. The two stars are well cast in their roles and do a wonderful job bringing their characters to life. But the true greatness of the film lies in Nicole's Directing style. She brings a realness and warmth to the characters and the story that is too often missing in today's cinema. She manages to get the best from everybody involved in the project from the actors to the editors. The movie itself is a tender but difficult love story. The difficulty lies in Elena's hesitance in accepting her new love in the face of what it will do to her family. This theme, in and of itself, is not original. But the approach of how it is portrayed is more real and believable than others' versions of that same theme. Just as a personal note, the two women playing the starring roles are incredibly beautiful and their onscreen chemistry could be cut with a knife. Nicole Conn's other films are also tour deforce showcases of her directing talent and if you like \\"Elena\\" you will like her other films just as well.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Saw this on tv sometime back loved it then an love it now,I'll watch it again soon thanks amazon! I will be ordering more in the future.
0761119752|5.0|You can't miss with Sandra Boynton books. Fun for you and your little listeners. There is just joy in all her books.
B0063M22QO|5.0|this is a great mahjong app!! the tiles are nice and big and I don't have to strain my eyes to play on my kindle fire.
0671449028|5.0|Another fun read by Sandra Boynton. All her books are as much fun for the reader as the listener. Enjoy!
B00AS1Q8FW|1.0|Yep.  If you buy the rights to three movies, you get to \\"act\\" the part.  Hopefully, with over 15 pretty good Jack Reacher novels, after Tom Cruise slaughters these first three, we'll get to see Ray Stevenson, or some actor near the stature, demeanor, and disposition, try Jack Reacher before they get too old.  If nothing else, let Lee Child (the author) play the part.  This could end up like Akira Kurosawa/Toshiro Mifuni with \\"The Seven Samauri\\" and \\"Yojimbo\\", and Sergio Leone/Clint Eastwood doing European/International western renditions of Kurosawa's samurai classics.  Some of us just want to see our true warrior/samurai, as written and captured nicely by Lee Child.  He's big, powerful, tough, rough around the edges, has his own code of justice, smart, doesn't take \\"no\\" for an answer, and will ultimately destroy evil.  With a good production team and a well cast actor, this Jack Reacher series could provide Oscar material, or at least provide our next generation John Wayne/Ward Bond/James Arness/Clint Eastwood.  Unfortunately, Tom Cruise can never do this part justice without the physical stature and temperament for the job.  Nice try, but we need the \\"classic\\" team.  If Hollywood doesn't get this right, the Europeans or Japanese motion picture industry will.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Love it!  Nice mix of classic and contemporary styles, including original works of his own with the help of some very talented friends.  Best one yet!
0802473156|5.0|I had heard about this book and decided to purchase to see what it was about.  It is very interesting.  I have enjoyed reading it and applying it to the people in my life.
1442337966|4.0|Loved The Secret, and The Magic,...so I got this one kind of by accident...seemed a bit redundant if you've already read the other two.
B004SUDQE0|1.0|The movie is excellent but the packaging and wrapping was poor. The dvd was broken. I was disappointed. That was my first dvd order, maybe my last... :(
1451673442|5.0|This book has changed my life.  Be prepared to do it as an assignment if you really want it to work.  28 day study in gratitude that is life altering.  Want to be happy?  Get this book, read/do as recommended.  Sit back and ENJOY the rest of your life!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|sometimes at work I only have 2 minutes to do some math. So this really helps me not get fired
B0042FZOFU|5.0|My daughter is a Toy Story fanatic. The individual discs have special features, so it's not like some of the bare bones sets out there. It's also nice that each movie comes in its own case instead of those annoying special boxes that are slightly larger than the rest of your collection.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|I found this book very well written and an original storyline.  I think it is more geared towards the 'tween age group, but I am a 'tween x 4 and I still loved it.  Not a super serious read, but definitely a great one for vacation/rainy day/time passer.
B005H9B44A|4.0|It is a good movie and it was fun to watch.  It was somewhat far fetched but, it is SiFi.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Got here quick in package and new as listed! Loved the movie and the price was better than in store prices!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is amazing. I love the way Rick puts the story. I will have to get the next book when it is published. Best book series you will ever read.
030759565X|5.0|I heard this author on NPR and knew I had to buy the book. It was a Christmas gift to my daughter. A friend looked at it before I wrapped this gift and was turned on to a new way of cooking as was I. So happy when new cookbooks like this one arrive on the market.<br /><br />It contains recipes I've looked for my whole married life.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Fairly predictable, though engaging &#34;from the dog's point of view.&#34;  It held my interest and brought laughs and tears that added up to a good read.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|This app shows 2 pages at once.  It is so nice to be able to read my books on a larger tablet
0061474355|5.0|The story is a change from all the other stories that take place on simple locations or that show the dilema between good and evil. I'd recommend it.<br />The book itself is a nicely built book. Pages are just right in thickness and have a nice contrast, as the pages are white and not yellowish.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|okay but there was one time that i almost lost all of my data  but its better than tiny zoo so thats great
0061743526|2.0|The book's quality deemed it 2 stars, I was not a fan of the story. Many will argue that it is an American classic, but I will reply that just because it's a classic does not make it good.
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I have been looking for calculators that will simply allow my math challenged students an ability to calculate fractions.  This is easy, understandable and involves only basic steps.  I need this on a basic hand held calculator the students can purchase.
B00AA36RZY|5.0|Read this and you will become a better coder it's that simple.  There is nothing else that needs to be said.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is the best game I have ever played on a tablet. I like raising the dragons and breeding them
B00BDRJ3Z2|4.0|PERSONALLY I have been buying Luke's Spring Break EPs since college and definitely crank them up year-round (but especially for beach trips).  This is the first hard-copy format for people not into downloading, but if you have all the previous EPs you can download the two new tracks individually without that \\"album only\\" nonsense.<br /><br />The title should give away the substance of this album.  I'm sure his forthcoming full-length studio album will satisfy the fans of his range - from country silly to deep and emotional - but this is just some fun he has every year, put in one spot.<br /><br />Calm down.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Genial edición y con audio en castellano. Además mucho mas barato que comprado en cualquier tienda de España<br />Totalmente recomendable.
B005JR3Y5W|3.0|The show is funny in an awkward, weird way. The characters are somehow relatable despite being completely bizarre. Hopefully no one would be naive enough to come away thinking the characters' lifestyle is anything to strive toward. The idea that people could really lead lives so focused on utter shallowness and still be happy and cheerful all the time is pretty unreal...  Overall the message of the show is contradictory and frankly, stupid. I did watch the whole season so I don't know what that says about me, but I definitely wouldn't suggest this show to anyone else.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is a very fun game to play it a lot better than temple run thought<br />maybe even better than temple run two
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it is so fun but need new birds and new levels to play on and hf h g gvhvhbu. n b j h.
B004R1VXYU|5.0|I love this cd. One of the songs will be played at my funeral. I believe it is called &#34;Song for you&#34;. It is being played by my sons for me
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great for kids and keeping busy at boring times. It's also great when you can not be apart of the country life anymore.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Love Josh's new album! Great lyrics and melodies. Josh is growing and expanding and is better than ever. Great for any listening mood!
B002RVZV9K|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie, 3 great guitarists...some would even say legendary.This was a gift for my teenage daughter who is just learning the guitar, she found it inspiring!. Fast delivery!..thanks
B00AE9UYJ4|2.0|You run around grabbing notes which takes forever.  I was drinking my coffee while pressing the forward button trying to get to the next note.  It's not slow it's just a great distance to get to each note. Very boring at least for me.
B0000714BP|5.0|i love this movie. this was a movie that i came across one late night. i begining part is my favorite when the three of them are transforming into there characters and snipe is excited about his shoes. it was an unexpected good movie
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is a great game to learn and play with game-loving friends.  The obsession with it is contagious; once you get hooked, you will want to keep playing it.  It helps if you know someone else who can teach you the game.  I tell friends whom I indoctrinate, &#34;It takes about thirty minutes to learn the game and the easiest way is to get the basics and start playing.&#34;  There are also some helpful youtube videos just explaining the basics.  Initially, it seems like there are a lot of rules, but once you get the hang of it, all the rules are fairly intuitive.  Anyway, it is the funnest board game I have played in years and I cannot recommend it enough.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love how you can personalize you alarm to wake you up in the best way possible. I am not a morning person so being able to wake up to my favorite songs helps a lot!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|don't understand it and I don't like it . doesn't let you kn ow if you won and when you do it is too late.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved the entire Hunger Games trilogy but Mockingjay was my favorite. I found the ending needed and bittersweet and real.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of my favorite television series.  Loved the characters - upstairs and downstairs.  Felt like I knew them personally.<br />On an historical level, the series emphasizes how world events contributed to the cultural change that took place in England after WWI and the decline of the aristocracy.<br /><br />I have now watched all three series and hope that there will be a fourth.  Not to be a spoiler but I hated the way the third series ended - hope it turns out to be a terrible mistake.
B00846F1YW|5.0|Best Free Game in a long time for this type of seeking game. I love these kinds and still haven't reached the end.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|Have not read a Tom Clancy book for a while.<br />This book is a good read. I can relate it to what is happening now in the real world.

B0042U2HLY|4.0|In my opinion, Bruckner s secret is strings ostinatti as bright as brasses and drums; shrill brasses in scherzos only, never in allegros,where they may be \\"forte\\"but not shrill.And,alas,the heavenly adagios, where we often need velvet Wagnerian brasses, where many orchestras don t quite speak Bruckner s tongue.<br />  I would say there is no perfect conductor for Mahler and  Bruckner, while meaning the whole cycle of symphonies.May be there will never be one whatsoever.<br />  Although Bruckner s orchestra is smaller than Mahler`s, there are fewer orchestras familiar to Bruckner than to Mahler, not to mention likewise conductors themselves.. Unexperient conductors may use brasses as if in a military band.<br />  I am a freak Brucknerian since childhood. I own cycles by Inbal, Haitink, Furtwangler, Karajan, Jochum and Tintner.<br />I had not need one more, but I ve bought Wand.<br />Bernstein, Baremboim, Solti, Chailly are not properly Bruckners addicts. As for Celibidache, I know he does not fulfill scores due to his amazing slowness.  I don t know whether various listeners have at home all Bruckner s scores, neither would I understand them should I own them. So, I cannot say Wand is or is not the closest one to rigid scores.<br />  Some people charge Wand with disruptive gear. I would tell this is Bruckners purposed signature, unrealizable even in 1890 for Mahler, who blamed Bruckners \\"discontinuity\\". By the way, it is  still \\"heavy\\" or \\"confuse\\"for most musical world at times,1890, or 2010. Experts have told us Bruckner s harmonic oddities were very profetic, avant garde.<br />  Since Haitink Concertgebow cycle is no longer available, I would hesitate between Karajan, Jochum and Wand... should one ask me which box to buy.<br />  I could say  Wand has ,mainly in allegros and codas, a spontaneous eloquence surpassing even the Karajan stereotype.<br />  Only in the adagios I `ve felt lack of Karajans solemn depth, perhaps due to my prejudiced ears. In allegros, Wanddoes not owe anything to anyone. As Bruckner is the master of adagios, I could not give Wand 5 stars.<br />  The 5th is even better than NDR dvd version under old Wand. Its finale ,like 8th finale, are given by Wand a majestic sumptuosity, not to mention these adagios( 5, 8 symphonies) are here quite flawless.<br />  Cologne Orchestra will never be BPO, however it is neither thin or strange to Bruckner s language.<br />  The first 4 symphonies ( I would never spurn gorgeous 1st and 2nd) are almost perfect. The coda of 1st movment in 2nd Symph  is  too fast, lacking its pomp.I know better Ninths than Wand's one. As for extreme movements of 5, 6 , 7 and 8, they ve surprised me.<br /><br /> Flavio J. Morsch<br />Santa Cruz do Sul, Brazil
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so . Awesome because of the running and boards that . Are in . this wonderful game
B0015DROBO|4.0|Having not seen the movie, I had no preconceptions going into this book. There were perhaps too many twists and surprises to this book. Creating a character from a persona that was obviously not an 'acceptable' social presence was refreshing to me.  As we grew to know her we applauded her exceptional resourcefullness and ingenuity with dealing with the trials that she not only encountered but, at times, anticipated.  Good read, good entwining if the 'old boys' network with the main plot, I felt.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game I always wanted my own horse. And now I have one. Only issue is all the training you have to do to enter every competition.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I love minecraft but I couldn't play it all the time so I bought this app. It's not like the real thing and you can't connect to any servers, your skin is always Steve, and it just has a totally different feel to it. It's not really worth the seven bucks.
B00992CF6W|5.0|It is really a good game for all ages. great things about the free feeling about building or doing anything. The seed generator is great for finding new and really cool worlds
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|This movie was great because it was an awesome original story. I loved the attention to detail. The movie was a little dark, but my four year old did not have a problem with it at all. She loved it. Hope this helps.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Solitaire is relaxing when I don't want to really have to think about anything too much.  I enjoyed it also
B00004T9UF|5.0|Honestly I feel that The Marshall Mathers LP is a deep and personal album showing us what the other side of Eminem goes through and the demons that haunt him. It's not just some stupid rap album, It's deeper than that. For example songs like \\"The Way I Am\\" and \\"Marshall Mathers\\" shows us how fame has chewed up and spit out Eminem. While songs like \\"Kill You\\" and \\"Remember Me?\\" show us all the anger that just kept building up inside Marshall for years. And of course \\"Stan\\" shows us that he does care about his fans and doesn't wanna see them do some crazy s***. But anyways like I said I Iove this album I think It's Eminem's best work 5 stars out of 5 stars.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Don't start watching this show unless you are ready to be hooked.  Has its ups and downs, but it's one a the few shows I like enough to buy when I have missed an episode instead of just waiting for a repeat.
B007V65R54|4.0|Good review of basic probabilistic thinking.  Silver uses various events and environments to help teach us how to look at event with a Bayesian lens.  At times the events and analysis are extended and a bit disconnected from what I see as the core purpose of the book--to help one develop a statistician's mind.  Worthwhile read nonetheless, but one at times the reader can breeze through.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|Godfather?  Blu-ray? $25?  Doesn't get much better than that.  I had the DVD box set already, but could not pass these up.
B002QP145C|4.0|I enjoyed watching this movie because I didn't know that much about the war in the North. Some really good battle scenes. It was the uncut version, so I watched it in two installments. Still, it had a lot going for it.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|Really like this case.  The part that surrounds the kindle back and sides seems tough, and the whole case is covered with matte, smooth finish.  I would recommend it.
B007XH6BPG|2.0|Awfible (a combination of horrible and awful).  This reminds me of the other bad progressive collaborations like Asia or Mike and the Mechanics and GTR.<br /><br />Chris Squire had the best solo album of any Yes member with his fantastic Fish out of Water.  Steve Hackett's albums have been uneven.  Most have some great songs, but also some dreadful songs. He would always seem to follow up a great song with a bad one, like Narnia and the Carrry on Up the Vicrage or Every Day with the Virgin and the Gypsy.  But, he has some albums that are great throughout.  And his live restrospective albums have always been fun and interesting.  Also remember that Hackett was part of GTR.<br /><br />This album reminds me of the worst of Hackett.  There are 3 songs that are OK, but the rest are not good.  Aliens is just downright awful.  \\"Aliens are only us/are only us/from the future\\", sung over and over again.<br /><br />The other big problem with this album is the sound quality.  A progressive collaboration between these two artists should have a powerful sound to it.  But, the sound is muddy and there is no dynamic range.  There is no high end or brightness where you would expect it.  Squire's bass almost never comes through and is lost in the noise.  Their vocals are reduced to drones in parts.  It reminds me of the sound quality of the Yes albums when they were first released on CD.<br /><br />I knock this down a star due to the sound quality.<br /><br />For the backup band, there is a very good keyboardist.  The drumming is mostly mediocre.
B008SVFX96|2.0|Aftermath of the Lowdown is a lowdown as compared to Richie Sambora;s first 2 albums, Stranger in this town and Undiscovered Soul. They are by far 4 and 5 star rated albums in my opinion. Aftermath is a mediocre effort and pales before the previous efforts. It will definitely require multiple sessions of listening for it to grow on you.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love this series, the actors, the story. My husband and I are very pleased & will enjoy Downton Abbey often. It is great to feel totally entertained by a series & find yourself anxiously looking forward to the next episode.
B004SH40BQ|1.0|not functional
B0018QQQK8|4.0|I read this book after having read another Nicholas sparks book with a very similar theme. Both were enjoyable, but there wasn't much of a deviation from the familiar for this author! If you like his style, this is exactly as expected.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|I am a fanatic of 007 movies; I've watched all of them a few times each and I have to say this is the best Bond movie so far. I wasn't too crazy about Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace, which were the first movies were Daniel Craig played 007 but Skyfall was amazing. It sidetracked from the usual Bond movies and I absolutely loved the idea of going back to the old Cold War times type shown in the first Bond movies with Sean Connery. Five stars earned 100%
B009MF5BXK|5.0|great action and funny lines by most of the actors special effects are great.loved to see van damn get butt kicked...
B000001DQI|4.0|Awesome album wanted it on CD, it is in new condition and looks  good but unplayable skips all over and static sounding ,tried multi cleaning BAD DISC waste of money.<br />need to buy another copy
B001EN71CW|5.0|great sci fi with humor ...great interaction between actors..  no ego problems between actors .. love the fast thinking on their feet...kinda shows what goes around comes around...and sometimes you don't always come out on top...sometimes you loose...but you keep going...
0307346617|5.0|This is a must read for people who like zombies and love reading. The sequences in the book are part action, part reflection.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Thrillers that feature ex-military, CIA types are often blood and guts, killing machine books that have implausible characters and story lines.<br /><br />I got this book as a gift and because I had absolutely nothing else to read - this is really not my type of book at all - I read it.  I was amazed by the writing, by the story line and the way it developed.  There was no &#34;over-the-top&#34; mass shootings; no unbelievable escapes; lots of vicious, crazy folks but they added interest to the tale.  When I finished the book, I sat back and thought about it and decided that the genre is not my favorite, but when a thriller is in the hands of Lee Child, it's worth the read.
B009POCG2C|5.0|All of Clint Eastwood's movies are great, but this might be my favorite one to date.  The father-daughter bonding in this film is so special and almost made me cry.
B00AHXDECG|5.0|You can tell that several songs were inspired by different types of genres of music. I think he did a great job with the album.
B0097AQEG8|5.0|Quality album to have on vinyl record. The next Jimi Hendrix in my opinion. Shipped on time and sounds great on my record player. A must have!
B004WGIXX4|4.0|I already saw Friends with Benefits so I waited to see this one.  Same story lines but Natalie Portman is very good and stole the show.  I would say, not a must see but a good stay home date night movie.  Enjoyed it!!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|It's really fun and you don't need real money which is really awesome! I'm enjoying it evenly and recommend this game to everyone.
B005H9B44A|4.0|I watched this after the Avengers Movie and I thought it was pretty good.  I would recommend watching this again.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app is stupid. If you want YouTube then go on to the internet(silk). It is still pretty bad there but it is better.

B002HJ9PTO|4.0|One of the best in its price range.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Audio is clear.<br />The mono to stereo jack makes single source audio easy to handle in post.<br />The clip is strong and isn't going to break.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The cord is a bit long and can get in the way if trying to keep all the cable hidden on your subject.<br />The mic head is big and tough to hide if you want to body mount.<br /><br />Other thoughts:<br />Order extra batterys. You aren't going to &#34;burn&#34; through them, but it's easy to leave the power switch on.

B004DI7HZ6|3.0|I want to like this book, and maybe if I read the second book, I will. The main female character just comes off as weak to me, which is disappointing because it seems like Deborah Harkness wants her to come off as strong. Diana never takes control of her powers, and that gets her into damsel-in-distress situations where Matthew must rescue her. I want her to be a more powerful woman.

I've been recommending this to everyone I know.

1401938906|5.0|Many books have been written about how thoughts shape our reality and that the world around us is influenced by them. E-squared by Pam Grout is one of the most insightful books on the subject I have read. It shows through experiments done by the reader how to attract abundance into one's life and that we do control how we see the world. E-squared challenges us to nine experiments in order to realize that our internal thoughts create our external reality. In the experiments we learn everything from there being a force of infinite possibilities to the fact that, as Pam Grout states, \\"The universe is limitless, abundant, and strangely accommodating.\\"<br /><br />  E-Squared is funny, light, and hard to put down. In fact I liked this book so much I did the first three experiments at once. I got immediate results. Let's say I saw a lot of cars and butterflies.<br /><br />  If you have doubts I encourage you to put your doubts aside, just for the 48 hours it takes to do the experiments (at least most of them) and see if they really do work. You will be amazed. From the beginning to the end of this book you will be astounded at the results and how in a scientific manner we are shown our thoughts affect our everyday reality.<br /><br />  I received this book free of charge from Hay House in exchange for my honest review of the book.

1595141715|5.0|It is hard to write about this book now that I have finished it. I am sad. I am angry. I am blown away by both the premise and the execution of this book. Jay Asher wrote a book that would be hard pressed to find someone it didn't change deeply. I know Thirteen Reasons Why left me a different person. And here are thirteen reasons why you should read this book, and then pass it on...<br /><br />1. Because when a girl wants to tell you why she committed suicide, everyone should listen. Hannah Baker is gone, but she left behind 13 stories about why she made the decision. She instructed the listeners, who are all mentioned in the tapes, to pass them on to the next person. She warned them that if they didn't, a second set of the tapes, full of their dirty secrets, would become public. And so a group of people, some more guilty than others, but all with a hand in the final outcome, passed their dirty secrets to one another. They needed to hear how they played a part in her decision to commit suicide.<br /><br />2. Because you never know what the consequences of your actions will be. Not all the stories are as horrible as the others. Sure there are some that will disgust you, but it is the small things that hurt Hannah the most. For instance, a boy she didn't encourage when he came on to her after another boy tried to force himself on her in a diner (she was basically stunned and in shock) proceeded to take all her notes from her bag in Peer Communications. Since the teacher acknowledged it was hard for them to give each other compliments, she made them all bags where they could leave anonymous compliments. Hannah needed those. They were like a lifeline. When she realized it was him who was taking them, it hurt her more than the boy who tried to force himself on her.<br /><br />3. Because bullying goes farther than the immediate incident. When a \\"Hot or Not\\" list placed Hannah in the \\"Best of\\" list for a specific body part, it seemed to make boys felt they had a right to objectify her. She wasn't even the real target of the mean-spirited list, but the consequences were long lived.<br /><br />4. Because even someone with genuine intentions can be too late to change the direction things are going. Clay, the narrator listening to the tapes, really cared about Hannah, but his appearance in her life was too late. She had been hurt by so many boys that Clay seemed too god to be true and Hannah felt too damaged to give him a chance if it meant opening herself up to more pain and suffering.<br /><br />5. Because there are some really bad people out there. One guy who repeatedly sent Hannah over the edge was known for this kind of behavior. In fact, as Clay listened to the tapes, he knew exactly who Hannah was talking about before she mentioned his name. So why did it take a suicide before this guy was called on his actions? Why didn't someone stop him?<br /><br />6. Because there are always signs. Teens, or anyone for that matter, don't just kill themselves without warning signs. Change of appearance. Giving away items, especially those they care about or use every day. Saying goodbye. Don't overlook the signs. Don't make excuses for them. You can never be too careful.<br /><br />7. Because even rumors and verbal bullying hurt. There is a misconception that rumors are just part of human nature. We are social creatures and we like to gossip, that's the justification, right? Well, why do we need to justify hurting someone for entertainment? Bullying isn't always physical. Many times, rumors and gossip are the most painful and the longest lasting, especially with technology today.<br /><br />8. Because suicide happens, even if we don't hear about it. Many times the news keeps coverage of suicides to a minimum, out of respect for the family left behind. Just because we haven't heard about it, doesn't mean it isn't happening right outside our doors. This isn't a problem contained in after school specials and teen novels. It's real and it's killing our children.<br /><br />9. Because everyone has a story. Hannah had a lot of them. Clay had his own. Everyone had their stories, and some of them were on the tapes. Hannah wasn't the only victim, she was just the one with a voice. Sometimes people just need their stories to be heard. Listen to Hannah's. She needs you to.<br /><br />10. Because the best way to stop something like suicide is to talk about it. The more shame and guilt attached to these feelings, the less likely kids are to come forward with them. Opening a dialogue in a safe place is the first step. Is it hard to talk to your kids about suicide? Good. It should be. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't do it.<br /><br />11. Because these characters are real people. Sure they are fictional for this story's purposes, but I'll bet you can think of someone you know who reminds you of Hannah. Someone who you think of every time you read Clay's story. You know a Bryce, a Marcus, and a Justin. So what are you going to do about it?<br /><br />12. Because it is about time teachers and adults were made uncomfortable when it comes to the emotional lives of our children. We have a ridiculous notion school is just for learning subjects like math and science and history. Wrong. Dead wrong. Our kids are at war from the time they start school until they graduate. It is high time they had some allies in the adults in their lives. We might be uncomfortable getting involved in the emotional lives of children, but if we don't try, how will be help them? Hannah might have been helped had one single adult known what to do to help her.<br /><br />And finally...<br />13. Because I need you to read this story. Like with any story such as Thirteen Reasons Why, I need to talk to someone about it! I am sure Clay felt the same way when he listened to Hannah's tapes. When something is that emotional, that painful you want to talk about it. I'm no different. So please, read this story. Yes it has some sexual content (mostly in rumors), and partying (not glorified), and uncomfortable subjects, but that is exactly why every adult and teenager should read this book. And when you do, you won't be the same. But that isn't a bad thing... not by far.g our children.<br /><br />9. Because everyone has a story. Hannah had a lot of them. Clay had his own.

1416914307|4.0|The Shadowhunters have a huge responsibility for such a young group of people: they must protect mundanes (you and I) from ugly nasties that go bump in the night. But life as a Shadowhunter isn't just dangerous because they hunt vampires, werewolves, and demons; it is dangerous because everyone they ever loved could be in danger because of their calling. Cassandra Clare's third book in the Mortal Instruments series, City of Glass is another thrill ride to keep you coming back for more.<br /><br />Jace doesn't want Clary to go to the City of Glass on the hidden Shadowhunter island; she is determined to go even though it is illegal to travel to the city without being invited. Despite the dangers, Clary knows the answers to her mother's disappearance are on that island, and she isn't scared of the consequences. When Jace and the others leave without her, she drags Luke with her to the island, but the presence of a werewolf in the city is more than just illegal- it is dangerous. While the Shadowhunters Clary knows are comfortable working with some Downworlders like Luke and newly vampirized Simon, the Clave members and their families on the island have very different, very sheltered understandings of what it means to be a Downworlder.<br /><br />In addition to her unwanted presence on the island and her missing mother, Clary is still reeling from the news that Jace is actually her brother. It was bad enough learning she is the daughter of Valentine, the maniac in league with demons to scare the Clave into waging full-scale war on the Downworlders, but to learn Jace was also his son was too much. She knows the island has deep answers, but the answers she has gotten so far have only made her life more complicated (and uglier). But everyone knows there is more dangerous evil out there than any Downworlder walking around: Clary's father.<br /><br />The interesting thing about reading this book so late is that I know there are 3 more books in the series, but at the same time, this installment ended with such finality. It almost makes me think the next three books were just an afterthought for Clare who has been notoriously stuck in this world for 5 or 6 series at this point (most upcoming)! Still, the stories are exciting. You can't deny that. They are entertaining, they are exciting, and they keep you wanting more. So even if you think Clare needs to move beyond this world, you still find it your guilty pleasure to join her in it time and time again!<br /><br />The series is great for a range of students. It is always action-packed, but the books are really long, and so could bog down a struggling reader. I once had a student who was very dyslexic but was addicted to these books, and he used to listen to the audio books. He loved them! Devoured them! So consider these books for a variety of ages and demographics, because they are just pure, easy fun!, this installment ended with such finality.

030758836X|5.0|I'm surprised to see so many complaints about this book's ending. Did you expect a neat, tied-in-a-bow ending? Did you expect to be satisfied? I can almost hear Amy and Nick laughing at you.<br /><br />As this novel progresses, you'll feel manipulated, deceived, betrayed... Isn't that what an unraveling marriage does to a person? Instead of just telling about it, Gillian Flynn decides to take you along. Ms. Flynn remains true to the end, leaving you flipping back and forth between the last page and the acknowledgements, your brows knit, asking, \\"Really? That's the ending?\\"<br /><br />No, you won't feel good when this novel ends. You won't feel satisfied or justified. You'll feel like a thorn has been inserted just beneath the surface of your skin: it won't really hurt, but it will itch and burn, and you'll feel it. And think about it.<br /><br />I love that I hated the book. Ms. Flynn wanted to provoke, to needle; and she does it brilliantly.

B00BLGXL3U|4.0|Tip: If you're still digging THE MASTER after the first 30-40 minutes, continuing to the end will probably be worth it; otherwise, it probably won't be.<br /><br />THE MASTER is another idea-driven experiential film. It's one to analyze and does not work terribly well as straight entertainment, so I can understand many people's reasons for disliking it. As my rating indicates, I like it a good bit even though I wish it had a more cohesive plot. This film combines a 1950s style, mood, setting, and soundtrack with expertly modern cinemagraphic techniques to very interesting effect. While it does not just try to be weird for weirdness's sake, I can only say that I have never seen anything remotely like it.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix gives a memorable performance as \\"aberrated\\" WWII veteran Freddie Quell, a unique if not particularly endearing character. The entire film centers around Quell's codependent relationship with Lancaster Dodd, the founder of the embryonic L. Ron Hubbardish \\"Cause.\\" Although they are two very different people, the way the two men connect in their mutual fantasy is both fascinating and believable.<br /><br />THE MASTER could be interpreted many different ways. It has satirical value in places, but its primary focus seems to be something about different individuals' search for meaning and happiness in this life. (Is it REALLY just all about getting laid?)<br /><br />This film's detractors frequently accuse it of being an exercise in sophomoric pornography disguised as \\"Art.\\" While there's no denying that sex is a pervasive topic in THE MASTER, for the record, there are only two relatively brief scenes of coitus/female nudity.

Nicholas Sparks is one of my absolute favorite authors and I wait patiently for each new book or movie to be released.

145162607X|1.0|I was so excited when I discovered that the new book in this so far excellent series was to focus on Anne Neville.  I had long wished for a good book about her and this had been such a wonderful series so far.<br /><br />Instead, this was a depressing and gloomy book with Anne having little personality.<br /><br />There are far better depictions of Anne's character in the few pages in which she appears in Susan Higginbotham's Queen of Last Hopes  and Kate Sedley's The Midsummer Crown from the latter's fantastic Roger the Chapman series.<br /><br />I realize that Gregory has become devoted to the characters of Jacquetta and Elizabeth Woodville and has done them proud in earlier books, but her efforts to see Anne without reference to who those women really are in the world she has created of Yorkist England is sad.<br /><br />The only thing that really comes through is what was already obvious to anyone who has studied this period, that Anne's father, Warwick the Kingmaker, was a viscous psychopath.<br /><br />I can only hope that with her next book Gregory will feel more at ease with her subject - Princess Elizabeth of York, wife of Henry VII and mother of Henry VIII.<br /><br />In the meantime, will someone please write a good book about Anne Neville?  Or do I have to do it myself?
0307277887|4.0|My fiance and I read this book because we are fans of the Dexter series on Showtime. We have become less and less impressed with the show as it has gone on and wanted to read the book that started it all to renew our love for the series.<br /><br />The first season of the show follows the book fairly closely. There are definitely some surprises with the ending of the book. All in all I enjoyed the book, but preferred the Season 1 version of the story. Probably because I saw it before I read the book.<br /><br />I will likely be moving on to the next book in the series and I look forward to seeing how the book and TV series continue to diverge.<br /><br />If you are a fan, this is worth the read!

B0058YPG2K|3.0|This was a typically great season of BB with a heart-pounding final episode, but my issues are with the blu-ray transfer itself, which was remarkably flawed and not consistent with the excellent quality of the previous three seasons. The image is incredibly blurry at times, as if some kind of digital noise reduction was used, resulting in weird flaws like frames appearing to blur into one another, causing characters' facial features to appear to jump around (it's hard to describe, you just have to see it). The video also appears to have been compressed to an unusual degree, evident in the banding that shows up in some scenes, in particular the ugly pixellated streak scene in the pool of blood during the boxcutter scene from episode one. There's even an inordinate amount of color shifting and flickering, defects I would expect to see in a poor transfer of a movie made 40 years ago, not in a tv series from 2011.<br /><br />I don't know what went wrong here - I hope AMC didn't screw up the Mad Men season 5 set like this. I buy blu-ray for the mouth-watering image quality, and this was a confusing disappointment. Strangely I've only seen a few complaints on the web - bluray.com is the only site I've seen who noticed issues with the image quality, and even they said it only looks that way in certain scenes, while hidefdigest.com gave it a 4.5 for picture and said it was consistent with the other seasons. Maybe there are two versions of the blu-ray somehow, and one has screwed up image quality? I've noticed people complaining about the lack of subtitles in a certain scene, and my copy has subtitles during that scene, so perhaps that's the case, but that still doesn't explain the overall off quality here. Maybe the usual authoring guys were tied up and some flunky stepped in a ruined the batch? Could be.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|I normally enjoy any variety of bbc masterpiece theatre and period pieces but for some reason I found this one tiresome.  Gemma A as an actress is absolutely wonderful, and I came across this after seeing her in Hansel & Gretel.  The plot and movement leave something to be desired.  It seems this was written and setup to spotlight Gemma as an actress.  In that it succeeds.

B0041KBWM0|5.0|I've watched all the previous Emma's including the one with G. Paltrow but Romola Garai takes the cake.  She embodies the youthful silliness of Emma from Jane Austen's book very well and Johnny Lee Miller is as usual, perfect in any british gentleman role.  I love to play this randomly just like Downton Abbey to have in the background and to rewatch on my ipad.  I hope to see more period pieces with Romola Garai.

0385302320|5.0|Third book in the Outlander series, Diana Gabaldon's Voyager continues the story of Clair and Jamie in an intricate story that continues to teeter between two centuries.  Thankfully, this book is also narrated by Davina Porter.  With over 20 years in the audiobook industry, Porter continues to set the bar for all audio performers.  Her mastery of dialects and devotion to the preparation of performing the books is evident in the riveting narrative.  She has won several awards for her performances, including AudioFile's 50 Best Voices of the Last Century and two different Audie Awards (that I know of, she probably has more than that ... or certainly deserves more).  This version was released about a year after the audio version of [[ASIN:B007SKJQC8 Dragonfly in Amber]] and I eagerly grabbed it to see what would become of the separated heroes.  I've listened to it several times since then. At nearly 40 hours long, it is the longest Outlander novel yet, and well worth your investment of time.  There are few performed books that can provide that much entertainment for less than 2 dollars an hour (at suggested retail price)!  If you have the opportunity to listen to this version, you will also be thrilled with it.

B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I honestly love this prequel. It had great special effects, good characterization, and a great story that shows how the Wizard of Oz came to be. The film tries to make references to the original 1939 classic film without being sued by Warner Bros. James Franco stars as Oscar Diggs (Oz) a small-time magician and con artist in a traveling circus. When a twister comes thru Kansas, Oz is trapped in a hot-air balloon and transferred to the beautiful and enchanted Land of Oz. He is greeted by Theodora and tells him of the prophecy of a great Wizard coming and saving them from the Wicked Witch. Will a con-artist magician from Kansas be able to step up and save the people of Oz from the Wicked Witch's army? I highly recommend OZ: THE GREAT AND POWERFUL!!!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Blurays are awesome, A Cappella is awesomer. Together, they make one hell of a combo. This movie is pretty hilarious and the music is awesome. If you don't like having nice things, than don't buy this bluray
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love it anyone should love Suzanne Collins work I love  this book so much you should read this great book
B003DZX44I|5.0|I have never seen a smile so big and bright as when I showed her this movie. Disney movies are made for little girls who dream of being a princess.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Loved this app until it updated and now I can't post anything....I have to go to the web and log in. I sent in many coolants over the past few months to the developer but it still doesn't work.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|i set an alarm but no matter what it wont go off. When I go back on the app it says it had to reset settings for whatever reason. You can try possible solutions but i couldnt
B0092MKFIY|5.0|There is not a song on this album that I don't like. I first heard &#34;Radioactive&#34; on a preview for a movie, and I had to have it. I've been listening to the album non-stop since Christmas. The songs are catchy, diverse and exciting. BUY THIS if you're thinking about it. I've just made your decision for you. It's worth it!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|awesome but whats stupid is that you have to pay more money to get one of the planets.Also there is a planet that is coming soon but there was a recent update which had nothing.
6301969413|5.0|What an amazing tale of US vs Russia during a time where our current allie did everything possible to obtain whatever information they so chose. Based on a true account Ice Station Zebra is a must see for the curious mind.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I'm used to playing games on pc, so i was delighted to find great graphics and ease moving about in the game on my kindle fire. You've got to try it out. It's fun!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|This is a wonderful movie.  It makes you realize the complexity of the job of a pilot.  Denzel did a excellent job.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I've gotten so addicted to this show. The only thing I don't love is that there isn't more of it out on DVD already.
B000N2HBSO|4.0|Interesting book. Good read. Too bad we don't have more politicians that love our country like these guys, who were willing to sacrifice their agenda for the good of our great nation!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|This app is definitely one of the better alarm clocks on the app store, but there are some flaws. U can't put music to your alarm unless u upgrade to the full version, which it tells u every time u set the alarm. It's a great app, but if it really wants me to enjoy it, it should stop reminding me that this version can't do anything I want it to and the full version can. It also shows u all of the things that the full version can do. It's like saying, \\"this app can do this and yours can't\\" when u don't want to spend any money on a stupid alarm. My opinion, get this app if u don't have a regular alarm clock. Otherwise, this app is a waste of memory space.
B00957T6X6|5.0|Simply amazing. The adventure and medieval politics that surround the game of thrones are thoroughly engaging. A must read for any fan of fine literature.
B0089LOKHG|1.0|What can I say... I absolutely LOVED the first 2 books in this series, so I had high hopes that this one would (as a trilogy usually does) sum up everything, wrap the story up, tell us who gets a happy ending, etc... Well it doesn't! My first gripe about this book is the author writes twice that Lenna does something \\"unconsciously\\". You can't do something unconsciously, the word is SUBconsciously... that was just problem #1 I had. The book itself starts out right where pandemonium left off, and it's amazing; then it just builds and builds and builds and builds and builds, then ends.<br /><br />You are literally left with more questions than answers. It feels to me like the author was in too big of a hurry to finish it and get it out there and the book suffers because of that. It's almost like she didn't have time to put a real ending.<br /><br />What happens to Tack? and Hanna? How does Lenna handle things with Julien? Does she and Alex ever actually get together? What happened to her aunt and uncle? What happens to Grace, does Lenna take care of her from now on? And what about the city??? The government is being pretty much overthrown by the invalids and then the book ends.<br /><br />If she ends up writing another book that sums up all of my questions then I might come back and revise my review, but if this is the last book of the series, then it sucks.
B008RXYOKY|5.0|I purchased this to use my 2TB WD external to my new 27&#34; iMac. The cable fits fits and works as design and it much faster than my firewire that I had on the 08 iMac. Works Perfectly!!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|keep up the good work. and the game very much, maybe you should have kindle vs other kindles members from
0062238868|5.0|I have great respect for Chris not because he has passed but because he so humbly recognized other servicemen and other branches of military as equally deserving of our respect.This book is not a glorification of one man.Chris Kyle also had the gonad's to call em as he saw em. He said &#34;Let us do our job&#34;, and I say GOD BLESS HIM for it  and god bless TAYA his wife for her great sacrifice. Someone took my copy of American Sniper so I ordered two more the next day. One paper back and one hard copy. Two days later ,whoever took my first copy returned it either because I put a return address sticker with an american flag on the cover or because their consience was bothering them.In any case I am glad to know I have a new copy coming in October!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Great game. Had a lot of fun with it,and I JUST got the game.I highly recommend it.Also good for those who like super mario bros :)
B00AZL3PBK|1.0|Every 5-16 seconds a &quot;Dating&quot; Ad comes up...<br />1. DO NOT Purchase, 2. Ignore App, and finaly 3. Leave the search &quot;Leps World or Leps World 2&quot;
B007N85POS|4.0|I like it but it gets harder and harder angry birds space is good cool major changes to the angry birds trligy
B0084AXZK0|5.0|Easy to read and get through really quick.  It's the story of a man and his worsening depravity.  I love the kindle format because if there's a word I don't know I can just select it and it shows the definition.  It even allows me to highlight the word so I can add it to my vocab list.  I prefer all my books to be in Kindle version now.
1401216676|5.0|no seriously, words cannot properly describe how awesome this book is, just read it. Seriously. If you haven't read it yet, you are doing something wrong.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|I HAVE'NT USED MUCH YET, BUT LIKE WHAT I'VE USED. PLAN TO USE OFTEN.<br />VERY EASY TO USE. . THANK YOU
B00BHMETKC|4.0|I was pleasantly surprised by just how good this movie is, afterall we start out knowing how it ends. Still has moments of suspense without oveekill
B009VSW15Y|5.0|MY GRANDDAUGHTER JUMPED RIGHT IN AND STARTED HAVING FUN WITH THIS. WE ALL HAVE TRIED IT AND IT HAS BEEN SIMPLE TO USE. WE PLAN ON PLAYING WITH THE POSSIBLITY.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|it's simple and fun<br />it makes for a pleasant way to spend some spare time or to clear your mind
B002QE3CTY|4.0|Filled with suspense but enough of the story line and secrets are revealed to keep you turning the pages. Quite the easy, entertaining read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|For some reason my kids van kill me in this game lol and the youngest is 4 and he still better but it as such a challenge but can get frustrating
B009E3EY38|5.0|I saw them on their last American tour and was dumbfounded. I felt the same way watching this DVD. Plant may not have the high end he did in the day, but he didn't even have to try as this career spanning set list was so dynamic. No one has the drum sound of John Bonham, except son Jason, so thank your lucky stars for that. The signature sound of Jimmy Page and the pure musical ability of John Paul Jones show that theses guys still have the goods. If you were not around when giants like these ruled the rock n'roll earth, than this is as close as you will get. A must have!
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|This is a great movie, but you have to pay attention to what goes on throughout the movie or you will probably not like the movie.  Great Story line.
B002ZHKZCY|5.0|Bought the whole series, great movie.  Good rewatch value too, meaning you can watch it a few times before it gets real old.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|Good story line, i enjoy subtitled movies this one fit the bill.  Enjoyable movie with some decent acting.  I recommend it.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|I loved the Format when they were still together so when I heard this guys voice on another bands album I had to get it.  Catchy tunes, great production quality.  A little too much autotune on a couple tracks for my taste, but overall a great album
B005N09L5C|3.0|Big Brother WAS watching!!!! Sat with my high school daughter to watch the movie after she read the book.  I think we all read it in high school.  It is still as interesting as it was back then, though 1984 has passed. recommend it.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Google is the bomb!  I love the search engine on my laptop and desktop. In my opinion tootle beats Bing any day.

B00BFUUMO8|5.0|a truly excellant simulation.  huge fan of the book and movie and as a kid I had all the action figures, playsets, the park power wheels jeep etc.  I love this app
B00AFARIZA|5.0|This is a great set at a bargian price, and I'd recommend it not only for Toscanini completists, but also for those who are sufficiently curious about \\"the Toscanini mystique\\" to want a decent symphonic survey of his output in the mid/late-1930s (or, 15-20 years before his last recordings for RCA with the NBC Symphony Orchestra.)<br /><br />It is of course probably natural that most listeners would want to compare these performances with others by Toscanini...and that can easily be done, in comparison to (say) his 1950s recordings with the NBC symphony, or in comparison to his fall, 1939 Beethoven cycle with the NBC symphony, or his early 1950s Brahms cycle with the Philharmonia. I'm not sure I can generalize my reactions; there are plusses and minuses. For example, I much prefer this version of Sibelius' 2nd to the later (more driven) version on RCA. Similarly, there is tremendous excitement to this version of the Enigma variations, even if this isn't the only version I'd ever want. Also, Beethoven's \\"pastoral\\" symphony with the BBC is just simply....exquisite (especially the winds, which are so totally on their toes they took my breath away.)  On the other hand, (sound aside) for the other Beethoven symphonies I marginally prefer the 1939 NBC Symphony renditions on Naxos. Brahms 2nd and 4th are a tossup between these versions and the ones Toscanini did in the '50s with the Philharmonia. The later Philharmonia versions probably win. On the other hands, Toscanini's Brahms on RCA isn't even in the running next to these.<br /><br />But what is equally pertinent to me, however, is how well these performances stand up to others at the the time, most notably those of Felix Weingartner in the Beethoven and Brahms. These Toscanini recordings with the BBC clearly have points of view that distinguish them from the Weingartners of the world, but also from Toscanini's other recordings. As I alluded to earlier, there are plusses and minuses in comparison, but I am very grateful to have this set alongside the others.<br /><br />Several reviewers (here and on Amazon UK) have commented on how Toscanini was able to take an orchestra with moderate strengths and get them to raise their own bar in performance. While I obviously can't speak to the state of the BBC orchestra at this early stage in their evolution, it is clear from these recordings that Toscanini was able to coax genuinely spectacular results from them in the midst of these performances.  I don't have a \\"trained\\" ear, and am not a musician, bu to the casual (but serious) listener, mot of these performances were spectacular.  The only places where I heard noticable slips were in the Brahms 2nd.<br /><br />Lastly, a comment on recorded sound. I am not an audiophile, so I'll let other comments on this in due course. However, EMI appears to have cleaned up the sound as much as they could on these recordings. All are fully listenable, although there is clearly some variation from recording to recording. After all, these are going on 80 years old. Maybe I have grown too accustomed to the limitations of \\"historical\\" recordings, but these days I hardly notice unless the surface noise or contraints on the upper end of the sonic range are an inhibitor. No consistent problems here.<br /><br />All in all, I can heartily recommend these. As the other reviewer pointed out, its a tremendous benefit to hear such a master as he evolves in his thinking on various works, and to capture, even in imperfect sound, a conductor at the height of his powers. These recordings were made fully a decade and a half before the relentless, almost ossified approach to standard warhorses that Toscanini took in the twilight years with RCA. All the more to our benefit. During the bulk of these BBC recordings, Toscanini would have been in his late '60s...think of the current generation of conductors at that age; for orchestra conductors, isn't mid-60s the new mid-40s?<br /><br />For comparisons, try:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00003OO0T Brahms: The Four Symphonies / Toscanini, Philharmonia Orchestra]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005MFGQ Beethoven: Symphony Number 5 & 7]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000269IN Beethoven: Symphony Number 1 & 3; Fidelio Overture]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000CNTLU Ludwig van Beethoven: The 9 Symphonies - Arturo Toscanini / NBC Symphony Orchestra]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000003EXH Enigma Variations / Pictures at an Exhibition (Arturo Toscanini Collection, Vol. 35)]]B00003OO0T Brahms: The Four Symphonies / Toscanini, Philharmonia Orchestra]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005MFGQ Beethoven: Symphony Number 5 & 7]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000269IN Beethoven: Symphony Number 1 & 3; Fidelio Overture]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000CNTLU Ludwig van Beethoven: The 9 Symphonies - Arturo Toscanini / NBC Symphony Orchestra]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000003EXH Enigma Variations / Pictures at an Exhibition (Arturo Toscanini Collection, Vol. 35)]]
B0097HSS4M|5.0|I really like the way I could do things with this programs. It was hard at first to learn but got it down pat.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Absolutely Classic movie for the newer generation. It is absolutely adorable and my kids ages 3-9 all love the movie and the older kids laughed at some of the puns and silly parts of the movie. It is really hard to get my 3 year to sit and watch a movie but he sat down for this movie no problem and only moved once...from the floor to the couch...perfect!!!
B008I43DYU|5.0|I really like this. It was big and helpful to see. I can use it easy. I have use this for a week now.
0380730405|3.0|The story of Rebecca is beautifully told. However, I found myself a little confused over the ending (don't worry-- I won't give spoilers here), and I spent a lot of the book frustrated with the protagonist (the unnamed second wife after &#34;Rebecca&#34;). Read Frenchman's Creek instead.
B00011F5DK|5.0|Our family loves this game!  It is challenging and thought provoking.  A good game for competitive family fun.  I recommend this game highly.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|I love this show, it has everything I want in a television show, action, drama, romance.  I just love the characters!
B008XGW1CI|3.0|I pre-ordered this book and anxiously awaited it's arrival.  Having enjoyed the Harry Potter books so very much, I was expecting the same excellent writing style that kept me captivated.  I must say, I was disappointed.<br /><br />None of the characters or their stories seemed to come together until quite near the middle of the book.  It did become more interesting at that point.  However, I personally found it to be a rather depressing read.<br /><br />Rowling is an excellent writer and the H Potter books held so much magic, wit, wisdom and hope that I neglected many of my daily chores just to keep reading.  (All seven books over a dozen times.)  I'm not a doting kid who hopes to learn magic but a highly educated senior citizen who enjoys a good read.
0316152196|5.0|The book arrived in great condition and it was a great bargain. Love , love loved it.I would recommend this novel.
B004ZQBP3Q|4.0|This a good buy for some different pop music to listen to, not much to say about this product. Few songs are good other you have to be in the mood for. Better music for light party back ground noise.

159413586X|3.0|book was received great did not enjoy the story out come. loved the first two books disappointed with this one
B00498YZH8|5.0|A refreshingly unique drama about a lifestyle and culture in America that the majority are us not aware of.  Although most likely exaggerated, one wonders whether life like this really does exist.  The acting is superb.  I am now even more encouraged to count my blessings every day. Just a classic good movie.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Love the premise of this movie, but the ending is slightly predictable about 20 minutes before end of movie.  The premise of the movie is amazing, and treats the subject matter with great care.  The idea of a time-traveling hitman plays into this story extremely well.  Would have liked more explanation on how the time travel itself worked and that backstory as well as the &#34;psychic&#34; abilities of some of the characters.  They are just small things that are glossed over that should have been explained better.  It, at times, has a Terminator feel to the story, but overall is a great ride.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Some of the aspects of the book are not tied up as neatly as the could be but it kept me engaged the whole time.
B00AYDC5HY|4.0|The animation in this movie is amazing.  Can't say the same about the story.  It becomes bogged down in trying to fit in as many class movie monster references as it can while not fleshing out character detail.  Love movie monsters, but just not as much as the crammed in references to them.  Was a great movie overall, but the story could have used more work.
B006LSZECO|5.0|First book I have read in awhile that you couldn't predict the ending. Don't read the end before you get there, it will spoil it for you.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|This movie is more of a family story.  About a father letting his daughter become an adult, and stop protecting her constantly.  A father learning to let his daughter become a woman who can protect herself.  All of this wrapped with lots of references to classic movie monsters.  Watched this around time that Frankenweenie came out.  Would MUCH rather watch this type of movie than that one.  If you like classic movie monsters and have the time, this movie is the one to watch!
B00846F1YW|5.0|We haven't finished it yet (both my husband and myself are playing it), but it's my favorite HO game so far.  Got it as App of the Day for my Kindle Fire 8.9.  Works perfectly, looks great, good story ... and isn't JUST HO, but also has other puzzles each level so I don't get bored.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I love being able to download the book and read it on my phone.  Having the book at my fingertips is handy!  I love the book!
B00000K19E|5.0|An instant cult classic and a 'must-see' for anyone that has ever pondered or perhaps continually questions the \\"norms\\" of everyday existence and ALL of the rules, laws, and dictates that society and/or whatever other potentially negative forces exist that may be acting upon your person/personhood (at any given moment). \\"The Matrix\\" may just become a relativistic blueprint for unraveling the mysteries behind the secret controls that one becomes aware of at the cost of \\"being awake\\" for generations to come. For one, I agree on some level with Cypher, that sometimes \\"ignorance is bliss\\".
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love being able to download the book and read it on my phone.  Having the book at my fingertips is handy!  I love the book!
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|Love all of the songs on this CD. Affordable price also. I can't wait until season 2 comes out so I can purchase that one as well. Thanks for much.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|You would expect a drop in quality,screen play, and acting when taking it from a movie to a tv show. This was surprising cery food quality in all aspects listed above. It was difficult to remember that this was a tv show. It was the good.<br />The video streaming quality was also very good. It is a shame this show only lasted two seasons.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Will probably use it as my book club choice the next time I host, unless someone picks it before me.  Loved it.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|She never disappoints! A real story about the human spirit and tolerance in this world.  My favorite Piccoult book so far!
B000035P5E|5.0|Follet has a great talent for spy/covert action novels, and this one is one of the best.  The movie was done back when sticking to the author's plot was considered a good thing, so fans of the book will not be disappointed.  Great acting, great scenery, this film is just great.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|So far this is probably my least favorite book in the series. HOWEVER, I still enjoyed it immensely. I felt like certain sections were dragging along but it wrapped up wonderfully in the end.
0765348276|3.0|not bad, but also not very satisfying. There is nothing really to the story; just the story itself, which isnt terrible, but also not great.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The author succeeded in getting me inside the character's heart and mind about living with a terminal disease. I appreciated the reminder that we are all terminal and Augustus (my favorite character) inspires us to live our finite days selflessly helping others find joy in their struggles.
B00785P2QC|3.0|feel like I'm waiting all the time for energy or money. I'm not going to spend money on a free app.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|Just like FaceBook  on your home computer. You can do more than you can with the other Facebook app. I enjoy using this app the most
B003TGMFG4|5.0|This is a great book.  It has life-changing potential and has had a distinct impact on my students.  The seller was great and very helpful.  My shipment was held up by the blizzard and they were ready to resend the copies right away in the event that they had been lost.  Very impressed!
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|Just getting started on this series.  So far I'm really enjoying the characters, looking for more in up coming episodes.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It was a fun book and all I could think about that night was reading it again an again<br />It has so funny
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Lots of back story and interesting characters, I'm enjoying this show very much.  You Downton Abbey lovers will enjoy this too.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|The characters were very good and the story line was great. I liked how there were several different stories all weaved together. It was a very interesting read and think most people would enjoy the book.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|If you haven't seen this series you gotta start here.  The character development over time begins in the first season.  You'll fall in love with all the characters.  The show gets better and better with each show.  Extremely well written and acted. Bravo!
B003JA5NUA|5.0|Great series, ended on an awesome note, though it seemed a little hurried.  Was a great ride though.  Definitely recommended
B00571F26Y|5.0|Very conprehensive book for explaining the dangers of wheat consumption.  Finally, someone is willing to tell the truth about wheat addiction!
B008NA2HMI|4.0|Even when caught, he tries to come off as the good guy, howver a very good read, fast paced and interesting
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I loved the movie but was so disappointed that the weather caused me to have to wait for my product especially after I paid extra for shipping to have it before Christmas and I purchased a second movie in order not to have a disappointed granddaughter.  While I understand the seller can't control the weather, I didn't feel like I should have been punished by being charged the extra shipping either, but life goes on and in the end she was happy....
B008NA2JMQ|4.0|Looking for sympathy from the readers....come to the wrong place.<br /><br />Little more then a con man and a thief, although on a grand scale.<br /><br />Fast paced and will keep your attention, my wife grabbed it straight after me and read this and the follow up. She thought he sounded wonderful, wanted his lifestyle. Poor me.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|again, recommended for teens who love the step up movies, our granddaughters were thrilled to get this movie at Christmas
B005LAIGLE|4.0|A very action filled movie, with great acting by Mark Wahlberg.  I thought the subject matter was fascinating. I have always been interested in the law and enforcement.<br />Thank you for your prompt and courteous service.<br />Norma
B007FROGME|5.0|This book was perfectly written.  It is easy to read, however the story is intricate and full of twists and turns.<br /><br />I read it in less than a week, which is a record for me, seeing how busy and full my life is!
B0051MKNV8|5.0|I have always loved Bradley Cooper, and think he is very talented. I will enjoy seeing this movie. Have a great week!<br />Norma
B003G4W49C|5.0|The only science fiction that's ever held my attention long enough to finish. Even better, my kids loved it too!<br />Well done.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I love Bill Murray. He is able to put himself into different characters, and play them with much feeling. His use of humor in the reality of his characters is great.<br />Thank you!
B001BPJJ82|5.0|very 'artsy' .... involves thought .... the shooting of the scenes & angle of the camera with contasts are excellent .... plus the storyline is great .... i won't spoil the movie ..... it should of won a oscar ... enjoy it!
0767805712|5.0|I have a feeling that this will be a very interesting movie. I thank you for your fast and courteous service. I hope you have a wonderful week!<br />Norma
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I was begging my wife for years for this collection and it does not let down.  I have been watching this for weeks on repeat. Yes its excessive, but every episode can be watched over and over again and gain new perspectives and understanding on what is going on in the story line, and get some very profound wisdom as well. Since some of the writers were on the staff of the West Win, it brings the show to a whole new level.  Simply the best show ever made!
B00AKL1XPU|2.0|I love (I should even say loved) this game. I was in the 26th level, but yesterday when I try to open the game it didn't open anymore. So I had to delete it and download it again but I also had to start from the beginning. :( also it crushes all the time. very disappointed.
B00BP4Z8XY|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie, but it went over the line. I have an 8, 6 and 3 year old, all three had night mares.  I was really taken back that is was a Disney movie.  Glad I waited for video and did not pay theater prices to be disappointed.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I was addicted right away. So get out there and destroy humanity! Oh by the way it isn't good for those who have a life.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Make sure you have a lot of time for this game.When you start you don't want to put it down.
B007VUCAVO|4.0|I needed a battery monitor and this app fitted the bill. It gives me the information I need in a clear and sensible way. Does what it says on the tin, and I recommend it on that basis.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This was another season of wonderful drama.<br />Didn't like the ending. BUT, I am not the writer nor the stars that didn't want to continue with the series.<br />If you are Downton Abbey fan, you will love this latest installment.
0765325950|5.0|So many reviews on here, I won't write much.  I thought the best scene was when we learn about the Flame of Tar Valon.
B00AFEYUVG|3.0|Although this movie had to demonize straight guys (except for the main character's brother and the main character himself)this was a truly original movie. The gay agenda was the same though: flamboyant, always funny and morally perfect gay guy, closeted gay guy (demonized) and moronic straight guys who must beat up the gay guy. Please, this is the gay Agenda. Why can't there ever be a gay guy, pretty basic, who is proud to be gay but doesn't feel the need to mention it 200 times a day? Also, the closeted gay guy's father has to beat him up when he finds out his son is gay. Not every father reacts this way. Come on. However, Ezra Miller (who in real life is gay) is a fantastic actor when he is not just being the stereotype. He was great in \\"We have to talk about Kevin,\\" with Tilda Swinton, who was also impressive. He stole the show. Emma Watson was somewhat flat in her role, although I really wanted to like her more. the main character (I forget his name) was good, but not compelling. The dialogue here was great! I am of an older generation, so I really don't know what goes on now in High School. Yet, I was angered by the way drug use, and sneaking powerful illegal drugs into a character \\"for laughs\\" was handled. This is no laughing matter! It's an assault and a crime.  I am also old enough to disapprove of the underage drinking, although this is as old as the hills. I love Ezra Miller. He's a young actor to watch.The power of this movie was in the plot and as I said before, the inspiring and complex dialogue. The use of one of David Bowie's greatest songs was apropos. The first scene when Emma Watson appears was ethereal. See this movie, but can we have a little less of \\"the flamboyant saintly gay guy attacked by demonic straight guys and demonic father?\\" Please?
159562015X|4.0|Quick read, and I was easily able to boil down the results of the strengths finder to provide useful affirmations of some of the things I am already doing. This is worth the modest price and modest time required to read it and take the 'test.'
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|wonderful presentation of LB! It is not necessary to subject me to such a long explanantion of why I found this perfect!
B00821OX98|5.0|Great series, keeps you watching, not all about fighting aliens, good stories and character development.  Good mix of military and civilian perspectives.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Excellent game does not have many bugs. Could be better graphics and should be a way to make the daily challenge available sooner
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I'm glad that I ran across this great app because I don't know how to watch videos on any other website without having an updated Adobe Flash Player on my kindle fire so it makes it easier for me to learn songs on YouTube : )

B00AE1P8UM|5.0|I use the techniques in this book and get the best results. I recommend it for you if you want to get in touch with the power of you subconscious mind.
1416550550|3.0|While the overall story was a good one, the method of telling the story in a bunch of disjointed flashbacks felt cumbersome and confusing. The book was about 100 pages too long. By the end I no longer cared about the characters and considered putting it down without finishing, something I have only done on 2 other occasions in my 48 years of avid reading.
1451627297|5.0|I was very happy with my purchase.  It was listed as a paperback novel but I have never seen this book in paperback version.  When I received this item it was in hardback but I am still very happy with it.  This book is as good as new.  No dog earred pages, no tears or marks in book.  As good as new.  I also received this product in a very timely manner.  Didn't have to wait long for item to arrive.  I would high recommend this seller to anyone wanting to buy  used books.

030745455X|5.0|I bought this triology for my husband.  All three of the books were in great shape and he loved all three of them!  Have been pleased with all the books I have purchased through Amazon.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|every song is amazing. he writes with such conviction and passion! and ryan's beats and production is nothing less than perfect as far as pairings go.
B0015DWLD0|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book--I stayed up half the night to finish it because it just grabs the reader and won't let go. It was a good recommendation to me from a friend and I would definitely pass that along.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Look, if you're considering this movie, there are three aspects you want to know about:<br /><br />1 - Production Quality : It's Disney, and they didn't hold back.  Definitely up there!  No complaints whatsoever!<br />2 - Theme/Atmosphere : This is a kids and family movie and you won't be upset about the content here.  It's safe for kids, but has a TON of references for anyone who grew up playing video games in the 80s.  The whole movie takes place in a video arcade, after all.....  Two thumbs up!<br />3 - The story : This is the only part that's not 100% awesome in my book.  It's a very predictable \\"outsider wants to fit in\\" storyline.  The two main characters are both outcasts in their own societies and want to be part of their mainstream society, but are unable to do so because society's rules are holding them back.  The movie is about how they rose above their society's rules and succeeded in making their own dreams come true.<br /><br />If you liked any of the PIXAR movies or have fond memories of video games, this movie is definitely for you!<br /><br />If you don't care about video games at all but want to see a good \\"role model\\" movie where someone who's feeling down and out can rise to the top, then this movie's for you!<br /><br />If you don't want to sit through a movie targeted at a young audience, then you might be disappointed.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The books are better than the movie that was made (so far), as usual. I normally only read non-fiction, but this series was the exception to the rule. You can relate to every character and you can see our world being like this later in life....let's hope not. Read this series! I also don't read the books that everyone talks about very often. Glad I did this time!
B002VHI8J0|2.0|I heard the author discussing this book on a radio show. What u heard interested me enough to buy the book. It's very well written but the story, such as there is one, makes it a tough read. I was anticipating some coming together if the various strands and it was this expectation which kept me reading. Unfortunately I was left unfulfilled when I got to the last page.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I love love the ice age....thought this would be a really fun game but it is really hard to get around and to understand the game.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|...that I've seen in a while.  I agree with previous reviewers--I was hooked. I watched the series in two days!  Never a dull moment in this series.  I watched the pilot twice, second time with the commentary.  Claire Danes seems like a fantastic person.  You can't go wrong with Damian Lewis, one of my favorite British actors. Eagerly wait release of season 2 on DVD!!
0307730697|5.0|Adam Brown is a hero of unmeasurable terms. Reading this book makes me want to be a better Christian. This is a well written book. Eric Bleme did a great job telling the life of Eric Brown.
B0012GN3RI|4.0|I haven't got any other Riot album. This is something else. Very strong band,  fine guitars indeed. A drummer who needs no introduction and a singer who does not bother! He can sing high and mighty! What you are about to listen to, is what the picture tells you! War sound, heavy, melodic, strong classical taste  and alot 80's, very nice.So thrashers proceed!
B004ZZFMTK|5.0|I have wanted this cookbook for awhile but always felt so intimidated by it. My sister bought it recently and I was flipping through hers and figured it was finally time for me to try it out. I bought it on the Kindle which I love. Having it electronically is nice because she is constantly referencing other parts of the cookbook in recipes and the electronic version allows you to easily go back and forth. I have tried several recipes and have really enjoyed them and they were not too complicated. I recommend reading her tips in the beginning as they are quite helpful and explanatory.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This novel sucked me in from start to finish, hated to put my kindle down... what an incredible story of love, loss, the struggles with depression & mental illness.
B005EHILV4|3.0|i really wouldn't consider this product a mixer. its more of an audio interface platform. but don't get me wrong. it works. but if your looking for a mixer. you may want too look at the behringer xenyx usb 802, 1002, 1202.
B00008BXJJ|5.0|This purchase was for another replacement CD for my worn out original AD/DC Live CD.  Never heard Thunder Struck performed so perfect as here on this.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Anthony Hopkins does a great job as Hitchcock. True to form. Good movie for those of us that remember the famous Alfred. For those of you who don't, there are some old shows available on Netflix to get acquanted. Not sure if you are not familiar with Hitchcock if you will appreciate this movie.
B0054S6N04|5.0|I loved this book so much that I have read it three times. Funny,sad, and suspenseful all in one.  Excellent read!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I saw this in theates with the passive (no battery) glasses. Loved it. Ordered it and saw it on my Samsung e8000 plasma 51&#34; TV which uses Active glasses. Wow, so much better than the passive glasses in theatre experience. If you want TV for movies and some PS3 Games, you will love this TV. The only downside is you cannot order these movies seperately, they all come with the DVD version, so more expensive $25-$35 dollars typically. Not sure why you can't just buy the 3D version, but all the ones I have purchased have both DVD and 3D Bluray versions.
6303020089|4.0|Pretty decent movie - action packed to be sure - never saw it until it was on cable channel so I became interested in owning a copy.
B00AA0TZTW|1.0|horrid mixes, lousy versions of tracks I already bought on other albums... this is no way to honor Jimi Hendrix... he's rolling over in his grave.  you money grubbing producers should be ashamed of yourselves.  The bonus track is a sic joke.  I mean those who applaud haven't heard Hendrix or they work for the record company or something... they can't be serious.  Don't be duped.
B00005LOUP|4.0|Pretty good remake although I am a traditionalist when it comes to remakes of classic movies- the originals are usually better than the remakes.  I probably stand alone but I prefer the animated version of the grinch.
1936608898|5.0|I gave this book 5 stars because it totally changed the way I look at food and how I eat. I feel better and have lost weight, my psoriasis is going away and I have a lot more energy.<br /><br />This book really explains how food works and affects your body completely. I highly recommend It Starts With Food and the Whole 30 program. Even have my family doing it and I've never enjoyed cooking so much!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is a cute game for toddlers and young kids. Not too difficult and keeps them thinking through each level.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Loved this series.  It is very well done and I can't wait for the next season to come out.  I've watched it several times.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|I like this app and tend to use it for sleeping to over other apps because it can layer more then three sounds.  Having said that I feel that for the price there should be more sounds like other apps that are cheaper.  This one does have some interesting sounds that differ fro<br /> similar apps but the premium is not alot better than the free version, just more sounds.  I also noticed on the free version it would not run in background if you left app but does on premium.  Try free then if you really like it then buy.
B006OFN0SE|5.0|This was a great movie and a good history lesson.  Acting was great and it was a very well done movie.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This last book was a little slow and somewhat more horrifying then the first two. It closes in a real way, not in a happily ever mood but a live in the sorrow but maintain normalcy way. The writings in the series will never be forgotten.
1439190275|5.0|Wonderfull. Has great ideas for keeping weight off and the proper way to build a routine for everyday living. You can adapt it well to fit your lifestyle. Would recommend to others.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I love the mix and match and very soothing tones to this app.  It's a charming fun combo that I get to pick
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I love it. It's funny, and great acting, and memorable characters, and AMAZING music.I honestly don't think there is a boring moment in this movie.
B007BRJYF2|2.0|Neither our kindle fire user or xoom user could play this game through. Did Not like It, a waste of money.  This is the first of many games of this type that we had no desire to try to finish!  VERY DISSAPOINTED! DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!
1419705849|5.0|A wonderful story for children. It gives a good model for how to treat other people and tells the story in an age-appropriate way.
0345803507|5.0|Everything and more! Looking forward to another book from this Author<br />job well done! Congrats! A must READ for all!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Seriously folks, there are far better erotica out there. This has to be some of the most poorly written prose I have ever read. Please save your money and go buy a book by Karen Marie Moning. She actually knows how to write.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|great graphics. my kids love this game as much as i do. the horses look real. i like training the horses its alot of fun. i have not gotten bored yet
030758836X|4.0|I will say it has a lot of twists and turns. Keeps you captivated making it a very quick read. I definitely recommend if you are looking for something suspenseful and intriguing.<br /><br />Follow @nissawise
B004JHYRAE|5.0|This book is essential reading for anyone considering open relationships or polyamory, and has helpful advice for everyone regarding understanding one's own emotions. Valuable for monogamous people too.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love this series and don't get PBS on our cable plan.  This was a great way to watch Season 3 uninterrupted.

B007REV4T8|5.0|as good as connery. i hope there is more bonds. exciting chases as usual. i hope creig stays for more bonds
B009GQ57ES|5.0|I loved this c.d.this was a great purchase and I loved the price that was even better it was great!!
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|The game was fun but for the $4.99 price for the full version I really expected it to take longer to complete.
B00168OIOE|5.0|Love movie with the family ,,,,can watch it over and over again ,,,,family movie ,,, kids would love it good movie good movie good movie good movie good movie good movie good movie good movie good movie good movie
B005P5TQPU|3.0|I hope my review conveys that while the series overall is an easy 5 stars, this season as a stand alone is far from it.<br /><br />It starts off with a good idea from the last season which was also a bit lackluster.  All of the good elements of Supernatural return here with impending world doom, monster of the week episodes, and shallow but fun character development.<br /><br />We also start off with a bang - leviathans!  I thought this was just going to be about the most awesome of all creatures.  Sure, they were tough and such, but I guess I expected more from them.  They seemed no different than a typical vampire or ghost in terms of running a situation.  Their master plan also wasn't too exciting... About the coolest thing these monsters had going was they had to eat themselves as punishment at times.  Also - if you thought the leviathans were introduced into the story quickly and with little thought, they left even faster.  They're all gone too - at least as far as I can tell with no mention of them ever again.<br /><br />There are of course loses for the boys.  They must continue to carry on by themselves.  The boys will never truly have a home or any family except each other.  This part of the season was better I think and keeps up with the fact it's just Dean and Sam going it alone against the rest of the world.<br /><br />The current season was partially set up by the 7th with the tablets that reveal awesome secrets about many of the main monster races.  This didn't need a whole season though as this concept was crudely inserted at the end.  It's a cool idea and we currently get to see it played out now with each monster having an ultimate kill switch or other things that can be used against them.<br /><br />Overall - it's Supernatural and a lot of the series favorites are present in the 7th season.  I just found the bigger story of it disjointed and it could have been more of a sub-plot to a bigger season.
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Not the biggest 007 fan....worth the 5.99...just not the admission to movie....seemed a bit boring compared to others..plot issue more than acting
0739308742|3.0|It is like the author was bogged down and wanted to be shocking (even more than the other books).  If you are into perverted sex and sadism, you will love this book.  By today's standards it isn't porn.  I do not know if I care how the series ends, because this book should have be skipped.  The author writes extremely well, but seemed to have lost the storyline in this book, or just wanted to drag out the series.
B0050XFY4O|1.0|This is not so much a movie as a diary or blog. It's certainly not porn, but it's not a movie either.<br /><br />And first up, do be warned, almost nothing happens. There's NO plot development as such, just long lingering scenes that all last way beyond their potential for any interest. I was shouting \\"CUT\\" about halfway through every take.<br />It's almost as though the director thought every inch of film he shot was just so wonderfully artistic that nothing could ever be edited, and we are subjected to the lot. There's even a weird segment where he overuses a new programme he's apparently just discovered that allows characters to \\"apparate\\" about the room with blurry effects. It has no meaning at all, it's just there because it is.<br /><br />The premise? Two half brothers grow up together, fall in love, have sex and there's a brief separation.<br />THAT'S IT!<br />Now if that's supposed to make us all reel about, dizzied with the shock of a semi-incestuous relationship, it's simply not enough!<br />Being half-brothers NEVER appears to worry them, so why should anyone else care? Even the viewer?<br /><br />Almost half the movie is taken up with the two boy's childhood, it which great and interminable pains are taken to ensure we see that they grew up with happy parents, in a loving environment, in luxurious surroundings, and were not subjected to abuse of any kind. This takes hours and you lose interest long before it's shown, re-shown,then underlined and reinforced about twenty times. The kids act OK, but enough is enough.<br />Has anyone ever heard of editing? NOTHING happens, repeat nothing; ...other than the domestic bliss of what is little more than gem&uuml;tlich home movies and childhood \\"happy snaps\\". We get the damn picture! We got it after the first five minutes already!<br /><br />After what seems like hours, finally Mum dies, .....but in what must be an editing blunder, or what was supposed to be some sort of artistic \\"imaginationing\\" by the director, she inexplicable re-appears in full flesh to swim languidly with the two older boys much later. Why? How? It's just never explained how she manages this resurrection. (Note to the continuity-person, .....DO take note of just what swimwear the blokes have on between their takes please!)<br /><br />The actors who play the brothers as adults are certainly good-looking enough,....although both have been waxed to within bare millimetres of a complete flaying.<br />They have sex in oh-so-artistically arranged positions, but communicating all the while in corny Hallmark Greeting Card quotes and sound grabs! This is truly embarrassing rather than romantic! People, ...(and certainly not men), do not talk like this.<br />The two actors can barely keep straight(ha!)faces as they are asked to deliver such flowery lines to each other. Hell, I couldn't stop laughing myself! Could they not find someone who can at least write realistic dialogue?<br />Mention must also be made here of THE most overly sentimental soundtrack I've ever heard, ..full of constant tinkly \\"romantic\\" piano and violins that play ALL the damn time as the camera lingers over everything and anything.<br />This can only be a highly irritating attempt to convey that the story is oh-so-deep, but you soon realise it's nothing of the sort.<br /><br />The movie also suffers from the taboo on showing the most evident and prominent sign of male sexual excitement. (Ahem!)<br />No amount of breathless and passionate exchanges of saliva, together with naked writhings, rubbings and moaning are convincing, when to the sharp-eyed it's plainly obvious that neither of the blokes are in fact sexually aroused where it counts at all!<br />There is one brief and rather coy attempt to portray online sex, but again, it's probably going to pass over most viewers heads as to what is supposed to actually be going on.<br /><br />The main problem here is we are meant to feel sorry, or empathise with two highly privileged and wealthy young men, who have lived in cosseted luxury all their lives, (their designer family home they inherit for nothing overlooks Sugar Loaf in Rio if you don't mind!), they have never had any hardship in their life, both have good looks and perfect health, one is an Olympic standard swimmer, the other had no trouble whatsoever becoming a doctor; neither are subjected to any discrimination or disapproval at all; (either for their sexuality or semi-incest), neither have AIDS; and the hardest thing they have ever had to face in their lives is separation for a while as one goes off to train in Russia! (Even that's not for ever.)<br />That's their ONLY problem in life! I kid you not.<br />Now why Mr. Rich Doctor doesn't simply go with his lover from the very start is beyond me, ....and that simple solution would have saved reels of over-agonising angst and nonsense there and then.<br />Then, ...much, MUCH later, the BIG reveal at the very end, ....SPOILER, SPOILER, SPOILER, ....is that HE DOES! Tah-Dah!!!<br />Bet you never saw THAT coming! (Rolls eyes!)<br /><br />This \\"movie\\" is just so ultimately unsatisfying. It has no real substance whatsoever.<br />You keep expecting at least something of interest to happen, (even a car accident?)...but it NEVER does! Endlessly watching two pretty boys go through the motions, while initially nice enough, soon wears thin because it's just not enough to sustain a whole damn movie.<br />That plus the fact neither of these over-indulged, over-gifted little rich boys ever manages to evoke our sympathy in any way. Envy perhaps, ...but they've already got everything possible anyone could want, even each other, so what the hell are they mooning and moping about for?<br />Get on with it, enjoy your wonderful lives.<br />We should all be so lucky!<br />I could not believe the way this movie ended, ..and you won't believe you sat through this entire thing from \\"Beginning to End\\" just to get to that final scene either.<br />What happened to \\"the middle\\"?n, who have lived in cosseted luxury all their lives, (their designer family home they inherit for nothing overlooks Sugar Loaf in Rio if you don't mind!), they have never had any hardship in their life, both have good looks and perfect health, one is an Olympic standard swimmer, the other had no trouble whatsoever becoming a doctor; neither are subjected to any discrimination or disapproval at all; (either for their sexuality or semi-incest), neither have AIDS; and the hardest thing they have ever had to face in their lives is separation for a while as one goes off to train in Russia!

0439813786|5.0|-Originally posted at bookyareview.blogspot.com-<br /><br />The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a magical and whimsical read filled with beautiful illustrations and a wonderful story for the ages.<br /><br />Hugo is such a wonderful protagonist. It's rare to find a character who is both smart and whimsical, but Brian Selznick proves to us that they still exist. He was such a fun character, and I adored every single second getting to travel with him through his adventures in the train station. Plus, I absolutely loved the setting. Inside the walls of a French train station was absolutely brilliant, and this is a world that I am dying to explore.<br /><br />The illustrations are simply gorgeous. Selznick really brings the world to life with these stunning works of art, and I appreciated that they were put into the story. It made The Invention of Hugo Cabret seem real and authentic and all-around a fantastic story, since not only do we get to use our imagination, Brian Selznick shows us the world through these brilliant illustrations.<br /><br />And I know that it seems long {since it is 522 pages}, but trust me when I say that it is a very quick read. I read it in the matter of a day. I think I read somewhere that there are only 25,000 words, which is not a lot. It's an easy book to breeze through with a captivating and gripping story that will captivate readers of all ages.<br /><br />If you didn't know, this novel was turned into a film (titled Hugo), which I do have to say was also just as great. But I loved the characters, the world, and the illustrations of The Invention of Hugo Cabret. Everything was magnificent.<br /><br />Overall, The Invention of Hugo Cabret is a must-read for everybody. Looking for something that is magical and vibrant? Then you need The Invention of Hugo Cabret in your book life.

B001AEF6IQ|2.0|I am a Doctor Who addict. Collect both old and new ones. Torchwood is a spin off of the Doctor by Davies the man who brought the Doctor back.<br />The show is not like Doctor Who which is good but it is not a good show. It does not have a true plot line and the characters are not trully developed. At one episode I realized that they would just sort of meander in to situation and then start spouting out about personal problems as opposed to the story creating a problem that must br stopped or solved.<br />I found the series to be a poor mans Fringe (which is a fun exciting sci fi series.)
B002I9Z8I0|3.0|I bought this DVD set to replace my old set of VHS tapes of the same movie series. While the picture quality was good, I was very disappointed in the sound quality of the first (oldest movie).. there were 2 or 3 scenes where the background noise of the ship was louder than the dialogue. (not that way on my VHS tapes so I know the movie wasn't intended to be that way). I could deal with that if it was only that one disk. The other 5 movies didn't have that same problem but they DID have spurts of volume blackout.. the sound would go out for one or two words of a sentence at least 2 or 3 times during each disk. Irritating but I can live with that for the price I paid. What set me off enough to write this review was that the last movie, \\"Undiscovered Country\\" was missing at least 2 scenes (or parts of scenes). The scenes involving the actor Ren&eacute; Auberjonois were completely cut out!! I tried to Google why this was done but couldn't really find anything that would justify why one of my favorite movies in the series was cut up! I looked back at my VHS and it was not a \\"special editorial cut\\" or anything either. I had read a couple of reviews before buying this DVD set and saw none that mentioned this outrageous cut job! (There might be some but I missed them) So now i have a DVD  in which my VHS tape is a better viewing of the movie than the DVD copy... that is maddening to me! I'm trying to think if i would still have bought this set if i had known the scenes were cut out...  I don't know... I guess if you don't know about the scenes they don't take away from the movie... but I do so it's bothering me.
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Evernote is way too capable to review in this forum.  It is the type of product that is impressive on first use and keeps your mind looking for new applications, both business and personal.  I still have to do a little studying to get the most out of it, and they provide excellent Help resources, tutorials, newsletters, and very quick responses to questions.  I have dealt with very large companies in my decades of professional work and this one has all the positive aspects that I  respect and trust they will be direct and supportive.  They also introduce new products at least every month and I have checked out a few and they added to my work skills.  They are very open to suggestions.<br />Very impressive

B004LWZWGK|1.0|Batman Begins......GREAT Batman film and acted as a great origin story to reboot the franchise.<br /><br />The Dark Knight....A bit too long in the tooth, but still an enjoyable film, despite some liberties taken with the source material. Ledger was great...but not as &#34;Joker&#34; as he could have been (that's the fault of the writing).<br /><br />The Dark Knight Rises....What the HELL happened??? This movie is the epitome of a train wreck. It is poorly written and leaves gaping holes in a plotline that had become far to convoluted to begin with. It is mired in socio-economic platitudes (Occupy Gotham anyone??), has well known characters in Batman lore that are light years apart from their source material (not in a good way), and has little to no redeeming qualities that made &#34;Begins&#34; SUCH a great Batman film. While I understand and respect Nolan's desire to make Batman less &#34;comic book&#34; and more &#34;realistic&#34;, the realism has gone into the realm of the absurd, and for all the wrong reasons. An earlier one-star rating here did a much better job than I could in pointing out the glaring plot holes, but even with their laundry list..there's even MORE than was noted.<br /><br />I am a film buff. I am also a comic book fan. I understand fully the differences that are somewhat necessary to bring a comic book character successfully to the cinema. Naturally, a non-comic reading audience must be reached for it to be truly successful. However...As absurd and fantastical as a film like &#34;The Avengers&#34; was, it hit it out of the park!! Why? Because these are COMIC BOOK CHARACTERS. Nolan has taken this far too seriously as if to make some kind of statement, although I can't figure out what that statement is other than &#34;Um....I think I let this plotline get away from me, so let's just shoot it and put it out while my fanboys are STILL fanboys.&#34; There is nothing in this film that is even mildly true to the source material. This is NOT Batmanby any stretch of the imagination. There isn't a likable character in the entire film (with the exception of Gary Oldman's brilliant Jim Gordon...the ONE character that is dead-on to the source material).<br /><br />All in all, it almost made me miss Joel Schumacher. Of course...that's an &#34;almost&#34;.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I've only had one pretty scary moment so far. I had about 4 papers, playing on hard mode on the farm at night. I was walking toward a building I hadn't been in yet, and I was curious to see if he popped out of nowhere like the reviews said, so I turned around. He was about, maybe twenty feet away from me. I nearly crapped my pants. The screen flickered and waved, so I turned around and set off towards the building. Bad idea. The building was pretty big, and had a courtyard, and I stupidly walked right into it, efficiently trapping myself. I ran into one of the buildings but found no paper. I realized I was trapped and was going to die, so I turned around thinking he would be maybe ten feet away or something. He was about two feet way, huge with tentacles sprouting out his back. I died instantly. Then at the menu you get when you die, I heard him whisper in the creepiest voice &quot;his car must have broken down&quot;. Pretty sketchy.<br />Here's a tip:<br />When you head in one direction for too long, BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU TURN AROUND BECAUSE HE WILL BE THERE!

B00B1E6FF8|4.0|Director Kathryn Bigelow and screenwriter Mark Boal garnered Oscars for their war film The Hurt Locker a few years ago.  While planning a film on the fruitless hunt for Al Queda leader, Osama Bin Laden, the fugitive was eventually tracked down and killed after a decade.  The filmmakers subsequently expanded their film, gathered from several first-hand accounts, and the result is Zero Dark Thirty, a thoroughly detailed, complex study in the greatest manhunt in recent history.  It is a fascinating study in the tedious work of the behind-the-scenes faceless men and women whose intelligence gathering efforts and in some cases obsessive determination culminate in the most stunning of missions.<br /><br />As audio of frantic, desperate victims of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center plays in the background, we flash forward a couple of years to the Middle East and a torture scene of an Arab prisoner witnessed by newly transplanted CIA operative, Maya (Jessica Chastain), whose intelligence is matched by her sharp tongue and dogged stubbornness.  As part of a group of operatives sifting clues and leads to locate terrorist mastermind Osama Bin Laden, she comes into conflict with  traditional, out of date methodologies.  Her theory centers on a courier who could be the link to their target, but to identify, locate and follow this suspect proves confounding and fruitless over the years as other hopeful leads fail to pan out or prove deadly. More terrorist attacks occur globally and there is a greater sense of urgency when Maya stumbles upon a crucial, misplaced piece of information.  A remarkable series of interviews in remote, secret locations and painstaking surveillance result in a possible hideout.  The question is whether to take the chance of launching a strike mission based on imperfect, yet probable data and plain, gut feelings.  What follows is a minute by minute recreation of the subsequent, military mission to end all missions.<br /><br />The infamous torture scenes are not so much violent as unbearable and uncomfortable.  To center on these scenes misses the point of the film.  While the story could have left out the bulk of these moments, they only serve to illustrate one of the means of collecting hard intelligence.  The film also shows the toll these acts take on the human psyche of some of the interrogators.<br /><br />Chastain's character is quite the rebellious analyst who is unafraid to speak her mind or display emotion.  What we don't know is her background or her family or friends.  This rough sketch of a character may serve this story adequately, but it denies the audience of more textured character development and audience empathy.  She has a deep resolve that will keep her searching for years and endless interviews often in disguise to protect her identity as she herself becomes a target, looking for the one misstep or inadvertent mention of a name or detail.  She even challenges and stands up to her superiors including the Director of the CIA (played with great effect by James Gandolfini) because of her self belief.  Hers is a female operating in essentially a male dominated profession much as Jodie Foster proves herself in similar environs in Silence of the Lambs.<br /><br />Bigelow excels with this intense, intricate screenplay.  She is in her element during the last half hour of the film (where there is effective use of a minimal musical score and eerie, night vision camera work) as the stealth helicopters proceed to their target and she flexes her filmic muscles, which she does as well as any action director.  John Milius (The Wind and the Lion) would be proud.<br /><br />As a chronicle of the remarkable mosaic of intelligence work, Zero Dark Thirty is excellent. If it lacks a little heart and soul, that's not the fault of the filmmakers so much as the source material.  While it could have easily been a thorough miniseries on television, it has been distilled to a highly engaging tale of good old fashioned detective work of the highest order. When Maya reacts to the mission's completion at the end, it is one of emotional release which the audience shares and could very well have been Bigelow's own reaction to a job thoroughly well done.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book with a lot of drama I recommend it too every one I already started the next book. ENJOY
B009AMANBA|5.0|The subject of many films over the decades, Abraham Lincoln has been portrayed to great effect by such top actors as Raymond Massey, Henry Fonda, and on TV by Hal Holbrook.  Steven Spielberg has assembled a great cast headed by Daniel Day-Lewis in Lincoln, a chronicle of the last weeks of his presidency and his final important accomplishment before he was assassinated.  As a slice of history, it is a fascinating insight into the political challenges that went into the 13th Amendment. As a portrayal of a historic figure, it could not be any better.<br /><br />In January, 1865, President Abraham Lincoln (Lewis) has been just re-elected and must contend with major issues particularly the ongoing toll of the Civil War.  Amid the inequality of the `colored' soldiers and a growing personal conviction that was marked by his landmark Emancipation Proclamation in 1863, Lincoln is passionate about getting the 13th Amendment (which would unequivocally free all slaves) passed in Congress.  At odds with his headstrong wife, Mary Todd (Sally Field), and surrounded by a doubting cabinet and strange bedfellows, Lincoln's challenge is to secure enough votes in Congress amid powerful opposition.  With the potential of a Confederate signal for an end to the war, Lincoln must weigh the political fallout of ending a costly conflict and achieving lasting freedom for all Americans.<br /><br />Lincoln is not intended as an all encompassing biography but rather a microscope into the President's last great act of his administration, and it illustrates his sheer will and unshakable faith. It demonstrates his disarming sense of humor and philosophy, and he is depicted as an imperfect human whose relationships are depicted as often dysfunctional whether it is with his paranoid wife Mary Todd over the loss of deceased son or his rebellious older son, Robert (Joseph Gordon-Levitt).<br /><br />Unwilling to compromise on his beliefs, Lincoln realizes that his legacy will be tied to this moment forever.  It is revealing how the political challenges in Congress are dealt with in bold strokes or subtle, delicate wording.  His battles with Congress have direct parallels with the current political climate.<br /><br />Lincoln had the foresight to look ahead and anticipate his legacy and how the world will look on to this moment in history including the proposed Reconstruction of the South once hostilities ceased.  The behind the scenes cajoling and arm twisting make for an interesting insight into the political process. As the momentous day for the important vote arrives, each congressman places his vote in a manner not unlike the founding fathers of 1776.<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis has become the Paul Muni of our generation.  By being selective with his roles, he has played larger than life period figures that have transcended their respective films.  He inhabits this role perfectly, and the makeup work and vocal inflections are outstanding.  When the war winds down and has taken an emotional toll on Lincoln, you see the President's line worn face.<br /><br />Sally Field is the perfect foil as Mary Todd, his opinionated wife.  Tommy Lee Jones is a standout in an impressive cast of well known actors (including Holbrook as an influential citizen).  His Thaddeus Stevens, whose support was instrumental in Congress, is an intimidating figure with an imposing demeanor.  He gets some of the best lines.  James Spader makes a fine, slimy operative for Seward, who is played with stern conviction by David Strathairn.  Spielberg consistently gives a slave's point of view to put things in perspective. The war and the amendment are seen through the eyes of former slaves particularly Gloria Reuben's servant to Mrs. Lincoln.<br /><br />The film is magnificently shot by Janusz Kaminski in a manner that emulates the iconic pictures of the period.  You feel at times that you are witness to actual, historic events.  We don't actually see much of the Civil War battles but rather theaftermath in the bodies and limbs that are testimonials to the horror of warfare.  Indeed, such themes recur in Spielberg films depicting World War I (War Horse) and World War II (Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, Empire of the Sun).<br /><br />There is a certain reverence and awe when you watch this film because the details are recreated vividly.  Tony Kushner's screenplay is the blueprint that enables Spielberg to add to a body of work that contains some of the best documentations of American history (Amistad).  There will be future film versions on the life of this remarkable historic figure, but it is difficult to imagine a better impersonation, period.

B005LAIIJY|4.0|L'enfant terrible, Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Reservoir Dogs, Inglorious Basterds), has specialized integrating his encyclopedic knowledge of exploitive movies into reinvented, genre films stocked with top actors and highlighted by dialogue enriched scenes.  The ultimate revenge tale in the guise of a slavery drama morphed into a western, Django Unchained is a highly entertaining adventure with a heavy dose of violence.<br /><br />It is the pre-Civil War South where cruel plantation owners treat slaves inhumanely, and guns rule the landscape.  A former dentist, Dr Schultz (Christoph Waltz), is a bounty hunter and seeks his quarry by enlisting the aid of a slave, Django (Jamie Foxx).  It seems bounty hunting is a very lucrative profession, and it facilitates Django's freedom and a means to search for and rescue his wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington), from a wealthy slave owner, Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio). As Schultz and Django devise a plan to win Hildy's freedom, Candie, who relies on the counsel of his slave-confident, Stephen (Samuel L. Jackson), begins to suspect a ruse and with time running out, it leads to an explosive, bloody end.<br /><br />Although his films tend to function and be appreciated for their parts rather than the whole, there are, of course, the Tarantino trademarks.  He knows how to build a scene, and part of the fun is the delicious interplay among the key characters.  As in most of his films, his characters are put in situations where there is an inevitability, a destiny if you will as the tension and looming threat of violence gets unbearable at times particularly in the climactic dinner scene.  He also has a couple of scenes early on which are meant to fool the audience in which things appear one way but are really a clever misdirection.<br /><br />Foxx is quite the stud as the determined former slave, and DiCaprio is cast convincingly against type. Yet it is Waltz who shines here, and he makes the most of a role written for him.<br /><br />As he has done in all his previous films, Tarantino has resurrected former stars and character actors in numerous supporting roles.  Part of the fun is trying to recognize a face under heavy makeup.  Try identifying Michael Parks, Tom Savini, Robert Carradine, Bruce Dern, Russ Tamblyn, Don Stroud, Franco Nero (star of the original titled film), Don Johnson, Dennis Christopher, or James Remar.<br /><br />The film is heavily influenced by spaghetti westerns with the long stares and moody musical score.  The action scenes are brutal and at times over the top; when has it not been so in a Tarantino film? One day perhaps, he should make a more intimate, gentle film to prove his versatility (like David Lynch demonstrated in The Straight Story).<br /><br />At 165 minutes, the film could use a bit leaner running time, but it is good fun if you aren't put off by the  periodic, graphic violence.  Tarantino may be a film geek with a nasty streak, but he definitely knows how to put together engaging, crowd pleasers, even if much of the material is cleverly recycled from older, obscure films.  He has devised a crackerjack piece of entertainment, and while he says he wants to make a very limited amount of films in his career, if they continue to be as popular and well written as this and his previous work, we may have to wait a couple years or more for the next one.  For his fans, it will be worth the wait.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|I liked The Panther and it is very topical since a plot line in the book discusses US use of drones overseas.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Director David O. Russell (Three Kings) has taken Matthew Quick's novel, Silver Linings Playbook, and adapted it for the screen.  It is a topic near and dear to him as his own son has bipolar disorder like the lead character.  By balancing dramatic situations with comedic overtones, Russell has accomplished a rare feat, an excellent drama with a superior cast that treads the fine line of humor.  By making such a delicate subject accessible to the masses, he has made a really entertaining, crowd pleaser.<br /><br />Pat (Bradley Cooper) suffers from bipolar disorder and, following a breakdown over a failed marriage and confinement to a psychiatric facility in Baltimore, has just been released to his parents' care.  Now back in Philadelphia and living with his parents, Dolores (Jacki Weaver), his doting mother, and Pat, Sr. (Robert DeNiro), a sports addict, Pat is determined to get his wife back despite a restraining order.  He is so obsessed with getting back with his wife that he boils over on occasion with emotional outbursts which threaten to send him back to confinement.  When he is not taking his meds or visiting his therapist, he runs in his neighborhood to get into shape in anticipation of repatriating with his wife, or so he thinks.  One day he runs into Tiffany (Jennifer Lawrence), another troubled soul who not only has been widowed recently, but now sleeps with anyone.  Their uneasy interactions lead to an unusual offer by Tiffany for him to partner with her in a dance contest in exchange for her being an intermediary and backdoor link to his wife.  What follows are the revelations of emotional scars and the realities of finding happiness in the most unlikely places.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, particularly the four lead actors.  Lawrence portrays Tiffany as a seemingly naïve, young woman, but she turns out to be a bright, perceptive person who is not afraid to stand toe-to-toe with anyone.  DeNiro has not had such a strong role in many years, and heshows just how good he still is.  Even Chris Tucker, in an unusual supporting role, registers as Pat's buddy from his psych group.<br /><br />The film is about how people, who are trapped in their own patterns of behavior, are afraid or unable to reach out and take a chance in life.  The depictions of mental illness are portrayed with realism.  When Pat undergoes mood swings, it can manifest itself as uncontrollable rage brought on by a simple trigger.  He has no filter to his reactions and responses which can be quite awkward and downright offensive.  Much as Jack Nicholson's character in As Good as It Gets laments if `this really is as good as it gets', Cooper's Pat tries to find the `silver lining' in his life.<br /><br />It is interesting to note that virtually every major character in the story has emotional issues in varying degrees.  At one point Pat actually thinks Tiffany is crazier than he is.  Pat's father, a superstitious gambler and bookie, has his own issues with obsessive-compulsive disorder. His belief that having his son nearby to ensure the Eagles football team a victory, leads to an amusing confrontation with Tiffany.<br /><br />When you have a cast that is this good, you have to look at the director, Russell, who orchestrates like a master conductor.  Despite an uneven filmography in his early career, he is rapidly becoming the actors' go-to director.  His attention to minor details like the simple act of tying a tie, a quick reaction shot, or hand gesture enriches the texture of a characterization.  His recent films (The Fighter) have taken noteworthy, acting ensembles and elicited superior, Oscar worthy performances amid strong storylines.  Somewhere, directing legends, George Cukor (The Philadelphia Story) and William Wyler (The Best Years of Our Lives), are smiling broadly.

B005LAIIHG|4.0|Yann Martel's novel, Life of Pi, had long been considered unfilmable until Oscar-winning director, Ang Lee (Brokeback Mountain), did the impossible.  He (with an adaptation by screenwriter David Magee) has made a visually stunning adventure about ultimate survival and the meaning of existence in the universe.  It is a unique film experience and one that requires openness and a certain suspension of disbelief.<br /><br />Pi is an impressionable young boy whose exposure to religion develops into an embracing of more than one faith much to the consternation of his father.  The family owns a zoo in the French part of India and one day are forced to uproot their lives and head to Canada by cargo ship.  During a powerful storm, the ship sinks and all hands are lost except Pi, orphaned and stranded in the middle of the Pacific Ocean with no help and a lifeboat filled with an unlikely manifest: wild animals including a tiger, oddly named Richard Parker.  An unusual dynamic plays out as Pi struggles to stay alive in the elements and contend with the ferocious beast.  As the hours turn into days and then weeks, Pi, left with only his instincts and ingenuity, is forced to improvise and utilize all his survival skills amid dwindling supplies.  When hope begins to fade for rescue, some unlikely, awe inspiring events occur that mean the difference between life and death.<br /><br />Lee, no stranger to computer generated effects (Hulk, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon), has done a major accomplishment here by adapting the challenging logistics of the source material and making it accessible and compelling to an audience.  He is no doubt aided by incredible advancements in special visual effects that form a significant portion of the film and recreate unforgettable moments including the fatal storm and the sinking cargo ship, the wondrous, luminescent phenomenon at night, and the depiction of animals in the lifeboat especially the tiger, Richard Parker, who becomes a major character.Some of the imagery is remarkable in 3-D.<br /><br />Suraj Sharma is quite convincing as the young Pi; it's a one man show for a majority of the film. The story, told in a flashback, is about Pi's ascension to manhood, and he is in essence is a citizen of the world, not having been bound to any one religion.  His curiosity and spiritual journey serve to make this an allegorical tale, and it is his relationship with Richard Parker that serves as a foundation to the story.  He wonders about his deadly companion and ponders the question, \\"Do animals have souls?\\"  In essence, Parker is Pi's Wilson (from Castaway) but with a soul.  Pi's interaction with the ocean is not unlike the solitary figures in The Old Man and the Sea and 127 Hours, in which mother nature can be lovely and deadly, giving and taking, a sort of protagonist and antagonist.<br /><br />There are unanswered questions.  What really becomes of Richard Parker? And are we to believe this fantastic tale as fact or fiction or a warped truth?  Is there a more plausible explanation?  Maybe that's just the point of the story: that life is full of questions and wonder, and sometimes truth is stranger than fiction no matter how unlikely it may appear.  Audiences who are willing to completely open their hearts and minds, will find a rewarding experience in this tragic yet fascinating exploration into the miracle of life.  And the movie does look hauntingly beautiful.
1401938906|5.0|I really enjoyed E-Squared by Pam Grout. If you've ever wanted to put the teachings of Esther Hicks/Abraham or &#34;The Secret&#34; to the test, well this is the book for you. The hands on approach with the 9 experiments were a lot of fun, and I learned quite a bit that I really wasn't expecting. Since each exercise takes a day or two to complete, it was nice to slow down and really absorb each of the messages the author was teaching, rather than speed read. I was planning on doing a write up on my personal experiences, but I found a lot of it, a little too personal and profound to share. Besides, I wouldn't want to give anything away, or ruin anyone else's experiments. Suffice to say, this book will get you thinking. It's well written, well researched, enlightening, and entertaining. It's full of great, inspiring stories and quotes as well. I recommend giving it a chance. The idea of woo-woo new age mysticism and scientifically measurable data meeting at a comfortable middle is too much fun to pass up. I received a free copy of this book for review purposes from Hay House, I was not paid for my review or opinion. My honest opinion of this book is that it is a fantastic 5-Star read.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|There are musicals, and then there are musicals.  This adaptation of the smash Broadway show, itself sourced from Victor Hugo's classic novel of the post French Revolution and the suffering plight of the populace has been transformed into an impressive film which will appeal to those open to its free flowing style of song and music.  Think of this type of musical as operatic narrative with hardly a spoken line of actual dialogue.  For the uninitiated and fans of traditional movie musicals, this may take some getting used to. If one can embrace the format, it is a well made, emotionally moving tale of love and hope.<br /><br />Spanning the years 1815-1832, in Paris, France, the years following the French Revolution have left the country divided with its common citizens in poverty and hard labor.  A prisoner, Jean Valjean (Hugh Jackman), is paroled under the watchful eye of policeman, Javert (Russell Crowe). Stigmatized by his record, Valjean flees his past and makes a new life for himself as an upstanding citizen until a chance encounter exposes his identity to Javert, and the hunt is on.  Meanwhile, in a related incident, a factory worker, Fantine (Anne Hathaway), has been unjustly fired and must struggle to survive and care for her young daughter, Cosette.  As Fantine must resort to desperate measures and all hope begins to fade, Valjean intercedes, and while Cosette grows into a woman (Amanda Seyfried), their lives intertwine with a movement to rekindle the Revolution as a growing revolt pits commoners against French soldiers even as Javert closes in on his quarry.<br /><br />Through these characters, we witness a wide range of behavior from treachery and betrayal to loyalty and unrequited love.  It's also about the secrets and the choices made especially by Valjean who comes to a series of crossroads in life. Jackman does a great job of conveying shame, guilt, desperation and anger, but those feelings give way to wanting to be a better man.  His Valjean is the conscience of the film.<br /><br />Hathaway owns her role as the doomed Fantine and has the chops to sing the signature song, \\"I Dreamed a Dream\\".  Her character's descent into hell is not unlike the doomed characters in The House of Mirth or Sister Carrie.  Crowe has the unsavory role of the obsessed Javert but proves an effective foil to Jackman.  The folks that made TV's The Fugitive must have modeled Inspector Gerard on Javert!<br /><br />The storyline has numerous supporting characters and subplots including one involving a pair of crooked innkeepers played with villainy by Sasha Baron Cohen and Helena Bonham Carter. (What's with these three name actors anyway?)  There is also a nice musical, montage sequence that alternates and merges several different settings and characters; it is directly reminiscent of the pre-rumble sequence in West Side Story.<br /><br />Production values are outstanding with the set designs realistically recreating 19th century Paris (with parallels to Dickens' London settings) befitted with costume designs of the period.  The camerawork relies heavily on handheld close-ups for realism.  Of note, this is one of the few musicals that did not loop the vocals in post-production. Rather, the actors actually sing on camera, and fortunately they all acquit themselves well with these terrific songs.  The effect is more akin to witnessing a live, stage production.<br /><br />The end is memorable as wishes and legacies are fulfilled.  When you figure the resources and talented cast directed by Tom Hooper (the King's Speech) that brought this to the screen, it is a remarkable achievement. Because of the theatrical source material, however, just be wary of the way it's all presented, narrative and all.  \\"Vive la France!\\"

1590171993|5.0|There are good books...and then there are books that move you so profoundly that the experience is worth more than gold. Stoner is written with power and restraint, clarity and poetic force. The story is sweeping, its prose easy to grasp, yet endlessly giving. This novel is one of the best I've read. Ever.
B001JYEMOQ|2.0|Not a very original idea... it was taken from the French film Purple Noon filmed back in 1960.  But look at all of the \\"artists\\" who have brutalized ideas from Shakespeare and some of his ideas were not very original.  I guess this the film industry's idea of \\"free trade\\".  But that's entertainment!  Enjoyed it.

0375836675|1.0|I read The Book Thief and fell in love with the writing style, imagery and story so I thought I'd try this one.  What a HUGE, SAD, and DISAPPOINTING book. I felt like I was reading a 4th grade novel.  I can't believe it's even written by the same author. I guess in that year between this book and The Book Thief Zusack took some writing classes.  No offense to the author, but I'm just trying to make a point. If you're wanting to read something by him, get his other book; The Book Thief.

B009AMANH4|5.0|Daniel Michael Blake Day-Lewis, Steven Allan Spielberg, and Anthony Robert &#34;Tony&#34; Kushner are the three primary figures who built the foundation for this powerhouse film.  In crafting this work, they deserve immense aplomb for granting the viewer a detailed and nuanced peer into the life and times of the sixteenth president of the United States of America.  I have read and heard the scattered peeps of complaints yearning for a shorter and less &#34;boring&#34; film.  To that, I say ha, and no, this film was not too long and it definitely was not a bore.  On the contrary, I longed for more.  I wanted to see more and more of Day-Lewis's portrayal.  He was so addicting to watch.  The mannerisms, the old English speech dialect, the stares, the outbursts, and the passionate arguments with dialogue so layered that multiple watches might still not be enough to grasp the density of the screenplay.  This film should go down as a classic, one of the greatest biopics since Patton, if not, the most important one since then.  Janusz's cinematography with the soft interior lighting, John Williams understated yet ready to sweep score, Sally Field and Tommy Lee Jone's fiery supporting roles, the costumes/production design that required immaculate research; I am not at leisure to list the entirety of the praise I am riveting forth.  This is an off-the-top-of-my-head review that I just had to type hours immediately after watching the film.  Now I fully understand the immense thanks that Daniel Day-Lewis has given to both Spielberg and Kushner in all the awards he has collected; they truly fed Day-Lewis that fuel to speak and move as if Lincoln himself was still alive.  Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis have done it. This picture belongs to the ages.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Dredd was a delightful film! Character development was subtle but believable, which seems rare for most action flicks.  Although Dredd doesn't actually have many lines, we  get a strong sense of his character (and the understated changes it undergoes) through small but intentional gestures, pauses, etc.  Fine acting throughout and an excellent script that included pregnant pauses and meaningful silence.  Very well done.  Highly recommend for anyone interested in a different take ont he action genre.

B007STXHTM|4.0|Let me preface this with the statement that GoPro cameras are great toys, and I love using mine.  The only thing I'm less than impressed by is the interface on this model.  The company has since made major improvements in their new models, but I'm using the first gen hero.<br /><br />The housing itself is watertight for sure.  I was able to test it down to about 30 meters without any issues at all.  Once I figured out how to make sure the camera was actually recording, it was easy to use on dives.  You can actually still hear the beep from the camera when it starts to record and that is extremely helpful.  I was actually surprised at how audible it still was, even with all my SCUBA gear on.  Picture clarity is good to okay under water.  Using the wide angle setting you lose a bit of quality but that's true wherever you use it.  However, the quality seemed to degrade faster under water.  Use the 1080p setting for the best results.  If you plan on diving, get this housing, no question.

B0089LOKHG|5.0|The ending is a true masterpiece from the first to last chapter.  The last few pages made me cry. Viva la Lena. Viva la Hanna.Viva la Grace. Viva la Julian. Viva la Alex. Viva la love. Viva la choice. Viva la freedom to love and feel and live. TAKE DOWN THE WALLS! Take them down. I think it was disappointing she left so much open ended. We dont know what happened to Han. We don't know if because of the resistance real change happens. We dont know what happens with the Love Triangle. Did Lena really pick Alex? How will Julian deal with it? I mean Lena was the reason he left what he knew. She was the reason he came to the wilds and for her to just go back to her past and forget about him...I mean no one in their right mind will just be okay with that. There was so much potential for the books ending. So many open strings that Oliver let unattended to. So many questions that werent answered. But I think past the characters, past the love triangle, the book was about the choice to choose. The choice of living your life how you wanted. The choice to not know what's going to happen tomorrow but still be okay with it. Lena CHOSE to LOVE Alex. Lena CHOSE to leave Portland. Lena CHOSE to save Julian when she knew they'd end up killing him. Lena CHOSE to go back to Portland. Lena CHOSE to fight for what she believed it. Hana CHOSE not to leave with Lena. Hana CHOSE not snitch on her best friend. Hana CHOSE to let Lena go. Hana CHOSE to tell Fred to stay home and leave him. Alex CHOSE to sarafice himself for Lena's happiness not once but twice. Alex CHOSE to put Lena above himself. And Alex eventually CHOSE not to leave Lena. Julian CHOSE to forget what he was raised to believe. Julian CHOSE to trust this Lena with his heart despite being scared. Julian CHOSE to go into the wilds with her. The Series was a series based on choice. Based on the freedom to do what you think is right. Your freedom to live your life. Your freedom to protect the ones you love. Your freedom TO LOVE, TO FEEL. The basic human principle of free will is laced throughout not only this series but this book. Despite the fact that we didnt get closure in the way we wanted this ending taught us a lot. TAKE DOWN THE WALLS. FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE. LIVE. Regardless of what happens for Lena and the rest of our favorite characters, regardless of if it's happy or even more struggles. They'll be living. They'll be together and they'll have the freedom to choose.TO FEEL. The basic human principle of free will is laced throughout not only this series but this book. Despite the fact that we didnt get closure in the way we wanted this ending taught us a lot. TAKE DOWN THE WALLS. FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE. LIVE.

However I thought she would include stretching in the beginning of the workout but she didn't. So do this on your own! I didn't and noticed stiffness everywhere not too long into the workout.<br />Do the forms as she said or duh you will have hurt knees or back. My knees started hurting but then I noticed I wasn't doing the lunges correctly to begin with so I fixed it. As for results can't say yet, just started but overall I like it!
0316743003|5.0|Always been fascinated with aviation. The skunk works was always a mystique as I entered engineering. It was great to read about it now that the material is unclassified. A must read for aviation buffs.
0345803485|3.0|I think I need to clear something up, before I begin. Fifty Shades of Grey is hardly BDSM literature; in fact, it's hardly erotic literature. It has explicit sex scenes and breaks readers into the world of sex toys and equipment, yes (for those of us who never knew what a Cat o' Nine Tails or kegel balls were--psh, amateurs)--but if this is what people are being introduced to as \\"erotica,\\" no wonder they've been severely disappointed. To those who haven't been disappointed, or have even been ridiculously enchanted by James's series: what. the. hell. is wrong with you??? Pornographic writing and a list of submissive rules/toys do NOT equate to erotica. Take it from me, who's read dirtier, sexier, filthier, and way more taboo than this. Please, just trust me on this one.<br /><br />This book isn't evil because of its portrayal of an \\"unhealthy relationship,\\" which is what I'm hearing from a lot of reviewers, or at least the conservative ones. The BDSM lifestyle has nothing to do with domestic abuse or inequality between partners; in a sense, it's power play--roleplaying for pleasure, and is perfectly sane and perfectly safe. I've seen many D/s relationships (in real life and in other books) that are way more tasteful than in Christian and Anastasia, but I won't divulge because this isn't a lesson about BDSM. The point is, if you can't stand the idea of pain for pleasure, you shouldn't be complaining about the \\"unhealthy relationship\\" in the first place. As for me, I can handle whipping, I can handle tears, I can handle bruises, and I can handle pain, but what I can't tolerate, is the disgustingly unrealistic dynamic between Christian as a Domme and Ana as a sub.<br /><br />James has committed no crime in writing about such a relationship; her only sin is glamorizing and falsifying it. It is a miserable portrayal of erotica and BDSM fiction--a poor, inaccurate, and unrealistic picture of a D/s relationship--and I'm sorry if anyone who's never read erotica before has been unfortunate enough to be broken into by Fifty Shades of Grey. Anastasia Steele is a bad initiator, and if you're a smut-virgin, you deserve much better than this.<br /><br />For starters, it doesn't even give you details of the relationship, aside from a list of hard and soft limits, a few unremarkable spanking scenes, some naughty uses for gray ties (from a man named Grey with gray eyes... ooooh!), and ONE exceptional--I'll admit--love scene involving a flogger. But that's it. All 500-something pages revolve around Ana mulling about the non-disclosure agreement she's so afraid to sign... no juicy deets on what the contract will actually promise.<br /><br />I'm not trying to kill the hype here, because I actually wanted to like this book. You'll see my rating is way more generous than I feel it deserves, because I do get why people fell for this book, at least partially, and will explain more about this later.<br /><br />People have said this is smut for smart women. No nO no No NO. This is the opposite of smut for smart women. These are presumably the same people who tell unsuspecting readers to \\"open up their minds\\" and give BDSM a try because it isn't all that smutty, it isn't all that bad. Well of course it isn't bad, because it isn't actually BDSM! You want real BDSM, real down and dirty kinky BDSM? Try Rachel Kramer Bussel's anthologies. Try Alison Tyler's. Try Carrie's Story, for Chrissakes, but if you've never tried erotica, do not read Fifty Shades of Grey; you will hate start off and end up hating the genre, which would be a terrible shame.<br /><br />As for the characters... this is where I'll start getting nasty.<br /><br />Anastasia is probably the dumbest narrator I've ever encountered in any book. I'm not kidding you. However, literally every man she encounters is smitten with her; she has multiple suitors throughout the book, which is inappropriate for her so-so looks and awkward, dim-witted, and terribly (and I mean TERRIBLY) naïve personality.I don't get it... even she doesn't get it. Which probably means it's just a fantasy on James's part, and perhaps even just an illusion! But I won't go there.<br /><br />She does have slight relatable humor to her, but it's just that: very slight. That's the only good thing I can say about her. She contradicts herself (and not in that way that makes me sympathize) and apparently is an academic, though she doesn't sound at all intellectual, save her sporadic references to classic literature in comparison to her own life. This, and her poor attempts at self-deprecation (\\"my hair never behaves, ugh!!\\") make her even more dislikable. All in all, she says the stupidest things, does the stupidest things, and lets her huge doe-eyed crush, Christian Grey, get away with the stupidest things. No wonder he had such a strong urge to beat her all the time; I wanted to give her a good whipping myself--that's how much I was irritated with her.<br /><br />Christian Grey is also a problem. He's handome, rich as sin, oozes sex appeal, and cares for the ordinary and unintelligent Ana. Basically, he doesn't exist. He, too, says weird, uncharacteristic things that makes me wonder if he's an android (possibly) and is also kind of a jerk. A self-proclaimed \\"fifty shades of 'effed' up\\" lives shamelessly and opulently... because he can. And I'm totally picking on him in this review because... I can. He's supposedly got a dark, alluring past that isn't ever fully disclosed. Thanks for telling us, but for not explaining, EL James. Really, thank you!<br /><br />The only good thing about him is his attractiveness, which I guess is the only reason why Ana likes him. This shows how shallow the basis of their relationship is. I picture him to be sexy as hell; I mean, physically, Ana doesn't skimp on the details. I'm sure he's a babe. But otherwise, he sounds rather bipolar, creepy, stiff... more like a serial killer than anything. He actually stalks Ana at one point. I wanted to swoon over his good looks, but found it hard to.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Christian finds Ana absolutely fascinating, but like I've mentioned, I can't see why. The relationship is even less convincing in that respect, and even less enjoyable to read about for 500 pages.<br /><br />Long story short: the characters sucked. The romance sucked, because frankly, there wasn't really any.<br /><br />Moving onto the next worst element of this book: the style. EL James's writing is simplistic (but not in the poetic way) with the occasional out-of-place SAT word thrown in for good measure. Ana's stream-of-consciousness first-person narrative is often difficult to follow--rather elementary in tone, like a middle schooler's diary--and I surprised myself that I even got through the whole thing. I think the quality of writing is some of the worst I've seen published, with lots of telling rather than showing (see my quotes below for references) and dialogue that's choppy, forced, and stilted.<br /><br />Aside from the poor composition, James seems to have an affinity for foil packets, dry murmurs (how does one dryly murmur, anyway??), gasping, wide eyes, the word jeez, and the six holys (*insert f-word here*, moses, hell, crap, *insert s-word here*, and cow, as in \\"I'm turned on. Christian is so sexy. Holy moses!\\"). If you can get through 500 pages of holy moseses, then be my guest.<br /><br />I know this is only the first in a three-book series (I'll be reviewing the next two... don't know whether to be excited or to burst into tears), but the ending was what was fifty shades of 'effed' up; Mr. Grey himself doesn't even compare. It has this cliffhanger that doesn't leave me hanging--the absolute worst--and it's almost as if James just wrote this huge 1500 page book about a stalkerish billionaire and a dumb college student, then chopped it up into three to create a \\"trilogy.\\" Oh wait.<br /><br />There isn't much else I can pick on; in summary, the characters are weak, the dialogue is weak,the style is pitiful, and the plot is pretty mellow, nothing fancy. It doesn't live up to the hype at all, but eff me, I read the whole freakin' thing in two days.<br /><br />See, this is where my review sort of does a 180 and I start praising it. You didn't see this coming, did you?<br /><br />I think it's the storyline. Like in Twilight, there's an irresistible troubled hero--who, I cannot emphasize enough, is really poorly portrayed and quite stalkerish/pathetic--and his uncontrollable compulsions for a girl who's wrong in every way for him. I'm a glutton for these kinds of stories, so yes, that is why I kept reading. Everything--the style, the characters, the sex--is weak, but the appeal factor is strong, definitely strong, and that's why I (unfairly) am giving this one 6 hearts: because I kept reading, and eff me, because I actually wanted to.<br /><br />So let's put it like this: The characterization, style, dialogue, BDSM elements, and sex scenes deserve 2-3 hearts.<br /><br />The intrigue factor, the fact that I kept reading and actually wanted to know what happened next? 7-8 hearts. I guess the story itself is good, but the poor writing and Ana's idiocy/ignorance creates this irritating shadow over the entire read. Even the sex, which you'd think would be the foundation of an erotic romance, is very mediocre... which is a euphemism for very bad. I don't think any of them were remotely arousing (minus the one flogging scene at the end SPOILER START which coincidentally, is also when Ana leaves Christian SPOILER END) because they were ALL THE SAME. And let's not forget the most absurd loss of virginity I've ever read in my life. I've definitely definitely read much better erotica. It's safe to say the love scenes aren't what make this book enjoyable--I could've done without them. And considering this is an erotic romance novel, that's saying a lot.<br /><br />Rather, it's the emotions, the overwhelming darkness, that keeps the story moving and Mr. Grey entrancing. There's a certain tenderness in getting to know him; he's got this dark, painful past, and she's got nothing. She wants to know him, but he won't let her, and this desperation is at once startlingly draining and hauntingly engaging.<br /><br />So overall? I weigh the factors and give it 6 out of 10 hearts. I'm certainly not saying there's anything substantial, anything sexy, or anything I get out of this series. I'm just saying I liked it enough.<br /><br />See why this is so frustrating??<br /><br />I hated everything about the book, but I was so immersed in the relationship and the elusive Mr. Grey, that I actually ended up kind of liking it as a whole. It's weirdly addicting, like those powered donut holes you hate and know are bad for you, but keep eating anyway (as EL James would so eloquently articulate).<br /><br />Pros: Grey is intriguing... while I don't understand Ana as a character, I do understand her attraction for him // I'm mildly curious as to what happens in the next book // Christian Grey weirds me out but I do feel sympathetic for him // Taylor, the bodyguard, is a total catch. I ship him and Ana // The emails between Ana and Christian are the only tolerable correspondence they two have... they're actually witty! But the in-person conversations... ugh. See \\"Cons\\" below<br /><br />Cons: They fall in deep, desperate love in like, two weeks // Sounds like it was written by a ten-year-old // Unpronounceable vocabulary words randomly thrown in the middle of sentences // Unrealistic dialogue //Ana is probably the most dislikable protagonist in history // Grey is the creepies freak ever // Cookie-cutter secondary characters, i.e. the likable brother, the doting mother, the best friend who has it all, the guy friend who secretly has the hots for Ana, etc. // The \\"dark past\\" isn't really... dark? Sorry. I've seen worse // Ridiculous and inaccurate portrayal of a submissive lifestyle // BDSM just isn't kinky // Sex scenes are awkward or just outrageously underdone // Overall not arousing // Ana literally calls Christian \\"Fifty shades\\"..... ok // Ending is balls<br /><br />Verdict: I have a manic love-hate relationship with this book and am awarding it a reluctant 6 hearts because Christian Grey, while unrealistic and overstated, is strangely hypnotic. I didn't like this book for the characters or BDSM or the romance, or even the sex; only for the story. I can't recommend this, especially if you're new to erotica; this is not the kind of book you want your first experience to be. I don't recommend this to you even if you read a lot of erotica, either, because you probably won't be able to finish it. So I guess I don't recommend it to anyone. It was a pretty entertaining read (more out of laughs, than anything) and I will be reviewing the next two books because I have to, but as it isn't particularly well executed, and often very frustrating, I suggest you spend your time and money elsewhere.<br /><br />Rating: 6 out of 10 hearts: Satisfying for a first read, but I'm not going back.<br /><br />Source: Complimentary copy provided by Edenfantasys in exchange for an honest and unbiased review (thank you!)the style is pitiful, and the plot is pretty mellow, nothing fancy.

I don't think any of them were remotely arousing (minus the one flogging scene at the end SPOILER START which coincidentally, is also when Ana leaves Christian SPOILER END) because they were ALL THE SAME. And let's not forget the most absurd loss of virginity I've ever read in my life. I've definitely definitely read much better erotica. It's safe to say the love scenes aren't what make this book enjoyable--I could've done without them. And considering this is an erotic romance novel, that's saying a lot.<br /><br />Rather, it's the emotions, the overwhelming darkness, that keeps the story moving and Mr. Grey entrancing. There's a certain tenderness in getting to know him; he's got this dark, painful past, and she's got nothing. She wants to know him, but he won't let her, and this desperation is at once startlingly draining and hauntingly engaging.<br /><br />So overall? I weigh the factors and give it 6 out of 10 hearts. I'm certainly not saying there's anything substantial, anything sexy, or anything I get out of this series. I'm just saying I liked it enough.<br /><br />See why this is so frustrating??<br /><br />I hated everything about the book, but I was so immersed in the relationship and the elusive Mr. Grey, that I actually ended up kind of liking it as a whole. It's weirdly addicting, like those powered donut holes you hate and know are bad for you, but keep eating anyway (as EL James would so eloquently articulate).<br /><br />Pros: Grey is intriguing... while I don't understand Ana as a character, I do understand her attraction for him // I'm mildly curious as to what happens in the next book // Christian Grey weirds me out but I do feel sympathetic for him // Taylor, the bodyguard, is a total catch. I ship him and Ana // The emails between Ana and Christian are the only tolerable correspondence they two have... they're actually witty! But the in-person conversations... ugh. See \\"Cons\\" below<br /><br />Cons: They fall in deep, desperate love in like, two weeks // Sounds like it was written by a ten-year-old // Unpronounceable vocabulary words randomly thrown in the middle of sentences // Unrealistic dialogue //Ana is probably the most dislikable protagonist in history // Grey is the creepies freak ever // Cookie-cutter secondary characters, i.e. the likable brother, the doting mother, the best friend who has it all, the guy friend who secretly has the hots for Ana, etc. // The \\"dark past\\" isn't really... dark? Sorry. I've seen worse // Ridiculous and inaccurate portrayal of a submissive lifestyle // BDSM just isn't kinky // Sex scenes are awkward or just outrageously underdone // Overall not arousing // Ana literally calls Christian \\"Fifty shades\\"..... ok // Ending is balls<br /><br />Verdict: I have a manic love-hate relationship with this book and am awarding it a reluctant 6 hearts because Christian Grey, while unrealistic and overstated, is strangely hypnotic. I didn't like this book for the characters or BDSM or the romance, or even the sex; only for the story. I can't recommend this, especially if you're new to erotica; this is not the kind of book you want your first experience to be. I don't recommend this to you even if you read a lot of erotica, either, because you probably won't be able to finish it. So I guess I don't recommend it to anyone. It was a pretty entertaining read (more out of laughs, than anything) and I will be reviewing the next two books because I have to, but as it isn't particularly well executed, and often very frustrating, I suggest you spend your time and money elsewhere.<br /><br />Rating: 6 out of 10 hearts: Satisfying for a first read, but I'm not going back.<br /><br />Source: Complimentary copy provided by Edenfantasys in exchange for an honest and unbiased review (thank you!)
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|This was one of the better games I've played lately and I am a h/o adventure game junky. Great graphics. Interesting story. I'll definitely be buying more.
0812975219|2.0|The author says at the beginning of the book that one goal was 'not to think'.  For what I read, this seems to be true.  It doesn't take much thought to say how great you are and how stupid others are.
1592536913|4.0|This book may be useful for everyone who wants to make something looking interesting and unique. For me it was pretty good.
B0050DIWFC|2.0|I've never been one to read and enjoy a book only to be disappointed by the ending but William Landay left me with an empty feeling after this book had ended. I feel like there were holes in the story (perhaps to cloud Jacob's true guilt) and it lacked a mystery or thriller aspect to the entire story.<br /><br />The first implausible detail were the wounds on the body, no defense wounds but 3 stabs across the chest evenly like from the use of a pitch fork. How these could be made without someone moving around, falling back, etc seemed to be lost on me. There also was a cursory mention of Andy being suspended straining them financially with needs to bleed nest eggs for the defense etc. but after the trial it was revealed that he was on the payroll all along (did that only resume after the case was over?) that would allow the entire family to live currently at their leisure.<br /><br />Again, the book lacked a mystery or thriller component that left me disappointed (hint: don't put a quote about a surprise ending unless the ending would be a surprise to an invested reader). It was less about the case and more about what such a mystery does to the family involved but the author never let it be that and merely glossed over the torment it was placing on the characters as a means to get to another day of the case that provided no real mystery to readers.<br /><br />Perhaps the Internet should invent (maybe its already invented) where you rewrite the last 20 pages of a book to better satisfy yourself and perhaps others, because I truly feel that I could have surprised everyone way more than the author did with the material laid before him.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|this game is compatible with all extensions and featured addgames!!! i bought first the gallery ed. but this is way more cool!! 100% customizable!
B008JFUNAU|5.0|The first 35 minutes had me worried, but thereafter it just kept getting better and better, gradually gaining momentum and ending strongly. The animation is wonderful; especially the China Doll- she is pure Disney magic! The storyline is fairly predictable, but too often movie studios ruin a film by \\"forced unpredictability\\"... yah, I made that term up. I would encourage others to see this film for what it is- don't avoid it for what it isn't. It is an enjoyable \\"ride\\", far better than I thought it would be based on critical reviews. It is NOT a remake of The Wizard of Oz- it is simply a prequel, and the storyline is extremely satisfying- Give Sam Rami credit for that. How can a confidence man become both \\"powerful\\" and \\"great\\" at the same time? Can he help others but remain in character- i.e. keep the con going whilst becoming a hero? I love this aspect of the movie- I don't remember anything in film like it, save possibly The Sting. So Munchkins- take it from the lollipop guild- go see it and let Disney present you with a real treat! It doesn't suck!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app, but can.some 1 tell me what 0.8.0 has thanks.  I really want online games, wolves, and buckets
0740797719|5.0|I highly recommend this book. After perusing it quickly when I received it I put it down. It took me 2 years to pick it up again and read. and each page gives me a new way to look at color and light. Very good.
B005HI4LMS|5.0|Such a good & funny movie! This had me laughing the whole time! Definitely worth spending the money on it*
B005LAIISA|5.0|Delightful animation, imaginative story and dialogue with a real message about family and friendship to savor. I highly recommend it! I've watched it a dozen times already and never tire of its entertainment factor!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This series is really overrated. . .could not wait for it to end. Did not enjoy it at all. Pick another book.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|I realized there was a explict version of this CD but accidently ordered it! Now it's only for adults ears and not the preteens. I realized AFTER opening it so I couldn't return it. I do enjoy the CD. Just wish I had payed more attention before hitting the confirm button.
B001ISZYKY|4.0|Very little of the Queen signature sounds. Much more influence by Paul Rodgers. Fun album. Pretty good rock and roll.
B0043KK4N6|4.0|I watch the movie ever now and then but realized more for the music rather than the movie. Now I can just listen to the soundtrack whenever without taking time to sit down and watch movie. I'm really enjoying.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|What a beautiful performer, complete with his band. Jason delivers new life with this performance. His message through his music is true Love & happiness. Very quick & clever.
B007HO392S|4.0|I'm not a country fan but enjoyed the song \\"Blown Away\\". I hadn't heard more than a couple Carrie Underwood songs before ordering this CD. She is more pop country than old school country. Find myself playing often so if you are a Carrie Underwood fan, I'm sure you'll enjoy this CD.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I think all American should read this. These men and women put their lives on the line for our freedom. This should be required reading in school. We should know what is going on in this world and stop sugar coating every thing.
0307341550|5.0|I really loved this book, in fact I read it in one day, couldn't put it down.  Would recommend this book to my friends or anyone who interested in thrillers.
B00028HBKM|5.0|I haven't watched the movie yet. Plan on sitting down tomorrow with my box of tissues and watching it. I heard it's great.
B008220DGE|5.0|THE MASTER was in local theatres for such a short time that I didn't even get to see it, so when it came out on DVD I lost no time in getting a copy. I loved Anderson's previous film, THERE WILL BE BLOOD, so was even more anxious to see it. It didn't disappoint. Beautifully scripted and directed, THE MASTER also boasts three amazing performances. Joaquin Phoenix's in particular was brilliant, so much so that I wished he'd have received the Best Actor Oscar rather than Daniel Day-Lewis, since Phoenix had to create his character out of whole cloth. Philip Seymour Hoffman is nearly as good as the character somewhat based on L. Ron Hubbard, and Amy Adams is fine as Hoffman's wife. Some of my friends have carped about the film being plotless or formless, with no resolution, but I disagree entirely. The relationship between Phoenix and Hoffman is enough in itself to carry the film, and I thought the ending was perfectly in keeping with we've learned about Phoenix's character. Do watch the outtakes sequence, since a number of questions are answered there. Overall, a great film experience, and a film worth seeing several times. Highly recommended.
B0002E5O9G|3.0|The only problem is that it had skip in it on the very first time I played it.  It was also played in a brand new car CD player.<br /><br /> the skips were in the finale portion.  I did not return it but I was disappointed
B00ACBN9CI|5.0|there's no other app (that I have found) that even comes close too this app (And its free!)  great graphics. and good controls. best app I have.
0316067601|5.0|This is a heartbreaking, yet superb book about heroism under fire. Excellent read. This young man went through so much, along with his unit. They are all heroes, as are all of our men on the front lines.
B000JMLFLW|4.0|After watching the movie Pride and Prejudice, which was one of my favorites, the book was even better than it would have been. The author is able to describe so well the meaning behind everyday conversations ,seemingly insignificant but actually but symbolizing alot.
B008CRC506|5.0|My wife and I got so hooked on Smash, we had to ration the episodes so we didn't stay up till the stupid hours watching 'just one more'.<br /><br />Normally, I'm a bit of a Grinch with my reviews, but all I can do is gush over this body of work. The writing is superb. The challenges of the cast are believable and in a nuanced manner, they reflect on the show's story (The life of Marilyn Monroe). The cast is perfectly chosen--we never could decide which of the two competing female leads to favor--which was the idea, I'm sure, but this is to say it worked.<br /><br />I hope when the TV series is finished that they develop this musical and put it on Broadway. We'll be booking our flights as soon as they do.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|Have been doing YouTube videos and am really impressed with this mic. Use it with my Canon t4i camera. I'm no expert but it sounds great on my amateur videos. Gives them a lot more polish. The only annoyance is the excruciatingly long cord but I knew about that when I bought it.<br /><br />I also remember someone mentioning battery life so I bought a large pack of batteries to replace them frequently. But I've recorded 8 videos so far averaging around 30 minutes of recording time per video and I haven't replaced the originals yet. So I'm thrilled.<br /><br />The hardest part is just remembering to turn it ON when you start to record and OFF when you're done! Great mic!
B004O86JZ4|3.0|I know that I am showing my age, but where (and when) I come from, LP's are run at 33.3 rpm.<br /><br />I applaud the Foo Fighters for pushing the envelope with this recording, but why doesn't say anywhere on the vinyl album that it is to be run at 45 rpm??<br /><br />I have over 200 albums in my collection and they all run at 33.3 rpm.  I don't criticize the Foo Fighters for doing this, but don't you think it would have been thoughtful to tell their fans of this true vinyl album that it needs to be run @ 45rpm?<br /><br />Do you think I can send a bill to Dave Grohl for the unnecessary repair to my turntable??
159315724X|5.0|I had heard so much about this book, so I finally read it myself.  Great read!  I was highlighting everything!  There are action steps at the end of each chapter to apply it.  I highly recommend it!
0385349947|5.0|Much more than a \\"How I did it\\" book - not that there's anything wrong with that - but \\"Lean In: Women, Work, and the Will to Lead\\" is so much more than that. Sheryl Sandberg has been criticized for being a gazillionaire and thus (the argument goes) that the ideas she writes about are \\"easy for her.\\" After reading this book, you'll see that this assumption could not be further from the truth.<br /><br />I'm a firm believer in the concept of KWW - Keep Women Working - and it makes me angry when I hear of women friends and colleagues who \\"opt out\\" of the workforce or throw in the towel on their high-powered careers because it's \\"too much\\" or they simply choose not to return to the corporate grind after maternity leave or some other life event that has given them a taste of \\"real life.\\"<br /><br />Well, Sheryl's book clearly shows you how opting out is NOT part of \\"real life\\" and how opting IN - way in - is the better option.<br /><br />A great book for young women about to embark on their professional (ad)ventures as well as women at every stage of their career - the personal stories, research, advice, insights and recommendations in this wise book will keep you leaning in, opting in and standing out in both your professional AND personal life.<br /><br />-- David Newman, author of [[ASIN:0814432867 Do It!

1579128955|5.0|Great book - fun read (for kids and adults alike), nice pictures - good choice with black background.  Binder is fragile - handle book carefully.
B0001Z53F6|2.0|This is a rip off for the price. It is a remix of music and most of it is B tracks that never made an top 100 list. I would not recommend this CD.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|i like the app wish it was easier to get the gems and that there were more levels of competition and available training and freestyle riding. maybe some more ways of earning treats for your horse.
B0095P3ULC|1.0|Wow, they're really up to 3. Indicative of the current state of horrible thrill-ride-esque non-movies that are all the rage.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love having another source to entertain myself when I need a mental relaxation.  I use it daily and get into trouble with my husband because he thinks that is all I do - play Solitaire.  (he is right MOST of the time! LOL)

B0000065TL|5.0|I would order again and I loved the movie. It was fast service and good movie quality to watch .
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Really liked this one.  Needed an easy read with substance.  About teens, but didn't feel like YA.  Will definitely read this author again.
0525953728|5.0|Movies are good, but the book is great.  Awesome detail and easy read. Mark Owen describes things so everyone will understand.  Amazing what these men have sacrificed to serve our nation!!  Thank You.
0380807343|4.0|The best way to experience Neil Gaiman is to hear him read his own work in person or via an audio book. His voice is full of British charm and wonder. The next best way is to read his books to yourself and let your inner voice color his prose. The worst is to see a film adaptation that adds characters and strips the HUGE helping of good-hearted wit that comes with his writing. Midway between those extremes is this graphic adaptation. Artist Dave McKean does a creditable job of preserving the characters and gist of the narrative. But he gets Coraline all wrong. She is not pouty, bored, blank-faced girl, but a young lass dying for adventure, terrified when she finds it and spirited enough to face it. None of her courage comes across in this telling. His straightforward style doesn't capture the oppressive and frightening atmosphere of the original.<br /><br />Still, this adaptation is leagues above the execrable movie adaptation, which adds an obnoxious BOY character to save Coraline from her nightmares. Good reading, but take the time to go to the source.
B00136LZG8|1.0|Where the heck did this come from??? It certainly sounds like it was mixed from a master, which is even more puzzling. This is a terrible, terrible representation of this great piece of musical artistry!! An abomination! Not only is it poorly mixed, but it is full of distortion and songs are roughly cut off near the end.<br /><br />I am listening on a set of LSR4028 Studio Monitors - widely used in professional recording studios.
B005603236|5.0|This is a charming adaptation of Jane Austen's &#34;send up&#34; on the fascination women of her generation had with Gothic romance novels. The director is to be commended. The acting was not overdone, the amount of tension and folly was just right. The blu ray does have the complete edition (not edited) of the original airing. Content to have added it to my Austen collection.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Like this game, only disappointment was that it wasn't longer. Good graphics, a good fun game for  adults and kids alike.

B004A8ZWW4|3.0|The secret the kid mentions is that Hugh Jackman's character Charlie wasn't the kid's biological father. You could tell when Charlie asked the kid, Max, if he was 9 or 10 and when the kid said 11, he then asked \\"are you sure?\\" I was waiting through the rest of the movie to hear this elaborated upon, I assume Charlie was not with the kid's mother 11 years and 9 months earlier. I'm pretty sure that's the secret.

B001I5M9SC|4.0|So I will say I've probably watched this Blu-Ray more times than most humans on this planet, having worked in Costco in the photo-lab right next to the TV displays, this was on loop for several months while I worked there. I still purchased it myself despite seeing it that many times, that's how good it is.<br /><br />In fact, this almost epitomizes what good production can be, and the height of a good video/audio system. I'll get into the \\"almost\\" in a bit, let me first state that the critiques I have.<br /><br />First critique, one of the cameras was of poor quality compared to the other cameras. This was often the \\"wide-shot\\" camera, also sometimes a zoom portrait camera for a few acts, and you'll note it is far fuzzier compared to the tack-sharpness of the other cameras. I have a few guesses as to why (probably an older camera that might not be a true production HD camera, but could either have a poor lens or a bad cameraman), but the end result is some scenes have a slight fuzz to them, where others are amazingly on-point; sometimes the other cameras also have focus issues, and this can be somewhat distracting to go from amazing tack-sharpness in visuals to a slightly blurred visual. A few other critiques include nobody telling Kenny G not to wear pinstripes for recording, if you have a good eye you'll see why that is; there also seems to be a very slight audio reverb issue on the harp on the second song in.<br /><br />As I said, these are small critiques, aside from the camera focus issue; a few other cameras also go out of focus slightly here and there, but having done several live events, some of it is acceptable, but the amount on this blu-ray almost makes it not worth it to step up to the blu-ray version. I could probably find a few minor issues, but this already being pretty picky.<br /><br />The pros to this are the amazing perfromances, and the audio will blow you away. The video production is pretty good overall, some of it spot-on and amazing to show in HD, but if you have a good audio system, the audio production hands-down makes this disc one of the best discs created. Having both an Infinity Primus 5.1 setup in my living room, and a JBL Northridge setup in my \\"man-cave\\", and the audio is so good it makes my hair stand up (no joke, I seriously get goosebumps hearing this). It is 5.1 PCM, or Stereo, but there is little if any compression that I can hear (I'm not sure if it is true uncompressed PCM).<br /><br />The performances are great, I don't know what else can be said other than to go into detail about how great they are (other reviews have done this already so I'll leave it to them). I personally found Heather Headley's performance to be much better than Sarah Brightman's (Sarah can obviously hit the high-notes beautfully, but the rest of the time she sounds like she's swallowing her tongue and is rather off-putting, again just my opinion, still a good performance overall).<br /><br />The price is steep, and still years later there seems to practically none in the used market and the price has stood high, but that is because, IMO, this is a really must-own performance.in HD, but if you have a good audio system, the audio production hands-down makes this disc one of the best discs created.

B005LAIISA|3.0|We were really anxious to see this one.  We have the other three which were really good.  This was so so.  It lagged.  Just did not hold us as the others did.  However,that being said, Scratt did not disappoint.
B0096PAA6E|5.0|Now I'm a fan of every type of music. But my favorite genres would have to be Blues, rock n roll, and R&B. I'm one of the biggest fans of Jimi Hendrix and so when I heard rumors that this guy was like the Hendrix well i had to check him out. Now that ive listened to this album a enough times I can see the similarities. Same style  on quite a few of his songs, kinda dresses like him too.  Its obvious this guy is influenced by hendrix but in my opinion this guy took what hendrix had done and made it fresh for this new generation. Not that thats hard to do with all the crap out there today where everyone just copies each others sound. Anyways alot of people say that there are too many mainstream songs. Well id have to disagree. He does a great job of changing up his style on each song so it doesnt get boring. It makes for a good listen. Too many times when you listen to albums you become bored with it because it all sounds the same. Great album worth every penny.
B0000026NC|4.0|Like many, I had this VHS tape and it was in heavy rotation in my early youth. As a die hard PF fan, I can say I've listened to all the music. This compilation is not meant to be the best Floyd has to offer. Whether you're a Waters fan or hater, what you experience with this album is a band having a good time jamming to some of their old tunes and exploring the newer stuff. The album as a whole seems rather dark with some slowed versions of songs including Comfortably Numb. It's a sampling of what Floyd can do and certainly a very early preview of the later Pulse album. With your favorite bands, you accept the good, the bad, and the inbetween. This is an inbetween album capable of showcasing some small gems and good memories. I would not recommend this album for the beginning Floyd fan but the die hard fans that can detect the pea in the matress will find the diamonds in here.

B009J2VQSK|4.0|Watching the movie, decided I wanted the soundtrack, and now totally enjoy it. Very creative (Danny Elfman involved!), in a good way. I enjoy the Stevie Wonder song but it almost seems out of place. A solid, good disc, well worth the $. I listen to it often.
B009YP9L7U|2.0|It was an effort to finish this book. I did not like either the hero or the heroine, she was horrible and I didn't feel there was any true chemistry between them. The premise started out fine and the first few chapters were fun, then they move in together and it goes downhill fast.

B00000IQW5|5.0|LOVE THIS MOVIE.  HOW IT ADDRESSES RELATIONSHIPS, GRIEF AND LETTING GO FROM BOTH SIDES.  HAD TO BE IN MY COLLECTION OF FAVORITE MOVIES.
B00000ILBK|2.0|Insurrection comes after First Contact in the Star Trek movie series, and if history tells us anything, any odd-numbered movie is sure to be a bust. This movie has a thin plot, and felt like an extended episode of The Next Generation. This movie didn't stop the writers and crew from making yet another lackluster movie (Nemesis), though Nemesis is slightly better. Avoid this movie unless you're a die-hard fan.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE.  THE RENAISSANCE ERA, THE INTRIGUE, THE ROMANCE AND THE POLITICAL TWISTS AND TURNS.  I REALLY ENJOYED WATCHING IT AND IT SEEMS LIKE IT COULD BE TRUE.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great and easy to use especially because the calculator is large, so the buttons are easy to see and press.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|i can't seem to watch this movie too much.  Even though the story line is familiar i love the exotic environment and the new language that was created.  The visuals are incredible and beautiful.  Will be one of my favorites for a long time
B005721Y7Y|5.0|Alan Ball's screenplay of American Beauty borders on genius. The text and subtext of the movie start at the opening scene:<br /><br />On video: Jane Burnham lays in bed, wearing a tank top. She's sixteen, with dark, intense eyes.<br /><br />Jane: \\"I need a father who's a role model, not some horney geek-boy who's gonna spray his shorts whenever I bring a girlfriend home from school. (snorts) What a lame-o. Somebody really should put him out of his misery.\\"<br /><br />The root of the family dysfunction is how they see each other. When Annette Bening's character pulls into a fast food restaurant Spacey's character works at, they trade overly polite remarks, then she shouts, \\"Lester, just stop it.\\" Spacey's character responds, cooly, \\"Uh-uh. You don't get to tell me what to do ever again.\\" That this is at a drive through window is relevant. To the wife, Spacey's character has turned from boyfriend to husband to employee. He's someone to help throw dinner parties. To the daughter, he's a \\"horney geek-boy.\\"<br /><br />Movies focus on what can be seen, and subtext is difficult to get across on film. But it's the subtext that matters. When I say some lame-o comment to Starbucks girl -- \\"It's busy today.\\" -- I don't really mean \\"it's busy today.\\" What I mean is, \\"You're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen, and your beauty frightens me, and because I feel pressured by people waiting in line, and also because I'm not sure you even like talking to me, this is the best I can come up with: It's busy today.\\" The subtext is the heart of the matter.<br /><br />The subtext of American Beauty comes across in the screenplay. Much of this movie takes place looking through Ricky's camera, or from points of view of other characters. Even the audience's pov: \\"Jane looks at us....\\" People watch us everyday, and we watch others. People judge personalities, and often get them wrong. The changes the family needs, then, aren't jobs or cars or murder. Each person needs to know that those watching them actually see them, and love them, despite any preconceived notions of what a husband or father or wife should be.<br /><br />Spacey's character often asks for his family to notice him, to ask how his day is going. They respond, Why should we? And that's the problem. Why should we implies being noticed and loved have to be earned. The subtext, however, is, We would, if you noticed and loved us.<br /><br />Midway through, Ricky's character shows Jane a video he took of a homeless woman who froze to death.<br /><br />Jane:  Why would you film that?<br /><br />Ricky: Because it was amazing.<br /><br />Jane: What was amazing about it?<br /><br />Ricky: When you see something like that, it's like God is looking right at you, just for a second. And if you're careful, you can look right back.<br /><br />Jane: What did you see?<br /><br />Ricky: Beauty.<br /><br />This woman, who the rest of society has thrown away, had a life, a family, hopes and dreams. Ricky sees all of that at once.<br /><br />And seeing is the heart of the movie. The surface movie is of a family that seems perfect, but has some hidden problems. The real movie is about how people see others, and what it is to see love.<br /><br />A person has to be willing to look.

1118156315|3.0|Drawing on principles from Business Model Generation, this book seeks to apply similar principles to personal modelling during times of career change & crisis.<br /><br />There are general exercises that require much introspection and soul-searching to direct the reader to finding their purpose and value in order to reinvent themselves or find new direction in life & work. I assigned the book three stars because it is quite general and other resources exist for more specific problems/areas. It is however a useful starting point and there are various (business canvas) examples of other participants who successfully made the transition, to draw from.<br /><br />The most useful thing about it is that it encourages an evaluation of one's life and work from a macro perspective. All too often, we are caught up in busy lives, busy existing, getting nothing done fast, never really living our purpose. If the techniques are applied thoughtfully and assuming one can overcome their own fear of the unknown, it is possible to transition into something more meaningful and happier.
B00AFEY354|5.0|As someone who never quite fit the ideal societal mold, I really appreciated this movie for showing the beauty in every individual
B006UN3K4O|2.0|The message is valuable but the contents of this book could probably be condensed into one tenth of its original length! I regretted the kindle purchase almost immediately, but didn't know I could return it, oh well, will know better next time. Buy it if communication is the sole/main issue of dissention in your personal relationships and both parties are willing to work towards communicating more effectively...

B001HN69B8|5.0|The locales are interesting, the acting is great, and the whole film is generally very cohesive and enjoyable. Some people are obviously never going to like this director. I thought this one was a keeper. Love the costumes and script in particular. I see nothing that would warrant this film receiving below three stars and I have seen a lot of film. Bump to 5 to even out the score. This is AT LEAST worth watching once. The bluray is a nice transfer free from any major setbacks like excessive DNR.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is and always will be my favorite story. I dont think anyone can top the love Anna and Christian share. It is a bit intense at times but the love they share is worth the crazy sex parts!

1451695195|5.0|According to a Gallop Poll conducted in 1992, over 8 million Americans have had a near death experience.  In research from around the world, near death experiences are described in a surprisingly consistent way.  The light, the warmth, a spiritual well-being, the notion of a boundary somewhere that if you cross it, you're not coming back. Medically, these are often described as hallucinations. Research and investigations generally fall under the categories of psychiatry and psychology, not neuroscience where it really belongs.  The spiritual aspects of life and death are also a consideration. In fact this is probably the most important consideration to prove or disprove association of NDE's with Heaven or God. In this case, this book actually 'disproves' the heaven concept because it does not occur across all cultures.<br />  The imagery  during each NDE  varies within cultures  A Christian believing in Heaven and Hell has different NDE visuals than a Brahmin with a very different expectation of an afterlife.  A patient's sex, age, or religious beliefs had no bearing on whether the patients reported near-death experiences. The only factor (associated primarily with cardiac arrest patients) seems to be the level of CO2 in the bloodstream.  The lower the level, the more inclined a NDE will be initiated. Having said all that, after reading this book, I would recommend this highly. Written lucidly and intelligently, it has been a joy to read, and a comfort to those of us who have had similar experiences. We may not yet have the scientific  explanations, we may not even believe in hell, heaven and angels, but we must all face death regardless. Sharing NDE experiences with others will surely make the transition from life to death less frightful and far more peaceful, as it should be. This has been a very good read,  providing ideas and insights that will have us thinking about this until we reach our own demise.

B000JMKQX0|4.0|imaginative, insightful, oddly a cultural tome of comparing nations and states, but eventually succumbs to its device (spoken word history) which leaves it without narrative drive.
B00BLGXL3U|1.0|Like another reviewer, I also thought this movie was too strange and the characters so dislikeable I gave up trying to follow the plot because I no longer cared what happened to them.  I just wanted the movie to end so I could leave. Fortunately, the 2 friends I talked into going to see this with me are still speaking to me, as they hated the movie as well. I understand many people liked this movie for their own reasons, but this just isn't what I want to pay $10 a ticket to see. I can stay home and be depressed for a lot less money.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I bought this book in oct, started it put it down, did not grab me, just got back to it and it started slow and picked up speed. But why does it always have to be about someone wanting to hurt Kay .That has become a sad old story.

0385341008|4.0|I liked the form, which is different and interesting and I liked the characters.  It taught me things I never knew about World War II, even though I've read a good bit on the subject.  A good read.
B00ARA4SLU|3.0|Alfred Hitchcock is rightly regarded as one of the greatest movie directors of all time, and \\"Psycho\\" is rightly regarded as one of his greatest films.<br /><br />So how better to tell the story than with a light, tongue-in-cheek tale about Hitchcock's marital woes and battles with the studio? \\"Hitchcock\\" is a fun movie with some genuinely brilliant acting, particularly by Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren, and it does show us how even the greatest have to fight for their art. But it also shies away from any kind of depth.<br /><br />In 1959, Alfred Hitchcock (Hopkins) had another runaway success with \\"North by Northwest,\\" but is bothered by a reporter's implication that his best work is behind him. While the studios offer him their best (such as adapting \\"Casino Royale\\"), Hitchcock wants to reclaim the raw artistic thrill of his younger days. So he decides to adapt a bestselling horror novel, \\"Psycho.\\"<br /><br />His wife Alma (Mirren) quickly warms to the idea, despite wanting to do her own writing projects with her friend Whitfield Cook (Danny Huston). But the studio balks, forcing Hitchcock to finance the movie with his own money.<br /><br />But Alma is soon annoyed by studio meddling and Hitchcock's constant ogling of the beautiful blonde Janet Leigh (Scarlett Johansson). Hitchcock begins to suspect that Alma is having an affair with Whit, and the stress takes a toll on both his health and the movie shoot. At the same time, he is plagued with insecurities about the movie's future, and whether it will sink his career.<br /><br />Hitchcock is a man who is still something of an enigma today, but \\"Hitchcock\\" doesn't really try to explore him in any depth. Instead, it dances between the Hitchcocks' marital problems and the trials of making a movie that no studio wants anything to do with -- and it does it with a wry, witty touch that borders on comedy without ever quite crossing the line.<br /><br />The writing tends to be airy and clever, especially when the writers dabble in Hitchcock's notorious macabre streak (\\"By the way try the finger sandwiches... they're real fingers,\\" he remarks when showing people pictures of a serial killer's work). In fact, he's at his most charming when he's lighthearted, such as the little stabby dance he does outside the theater on opening night.<br /><br />However, I felt that \\"Hitchcock\\" avoided handling its story with any depth. The marital spat is cleared up too quickly and cleanly, and his controlling nature towards the \\"Hitchcock blondes\\" is briefly touched on but never really explored. And Hitchcock's conversations with an imaginary Ed Gein seemed strangely out of sync with the tone of the overall movie.<br /><br />But Hopkins plays Hitchcock as a genial, witty man with some darker sides, and he mimics Hitchcock's speech and body language nicely. On the flipside, Mirren plays Alma as a fiery, intelligent woman who is content to remain in her husband's shadow, but also wants to be appreciated for it. And James D'Arcy and Scarlett Johansson do fine smaller roles as Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh.<br /><br />\\"Hitchcock\\" is not a bad movie, just a lightweight one -- excellent acting, a somewhat flimsy story, and plenty of behind-the-scenes woes for a now-beloved movie. See it for the performances and the banter.dabble in Hitchcock's notorious macabre streak (\\"By the way try the finger sandwiches... they're real fingers,\\" he remarks when showing people pictures of a serial killer's work).
