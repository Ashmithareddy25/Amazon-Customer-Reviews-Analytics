B00AIUUXHC|4.0|the game is pretty cool except gems are way too hard to get maybe you guys should throw some more gems in there. wink wink ;)
1560100842|5.0|if there were one book that i could have about cartooning, this would be it. This book can take a beginner to an advanced level, offering thorough details in a logical progression- stuff like showing how to shape the basic character, and how to shape the mouth of a character for each syllable they speak, and how to time the patterns of movement for a character. I've got a long way as an illustrator, and i'm confident this book is going to be a great reference all along the way.
B0053FANS6|5.0|Always loved the movie. I'm glad I bought this trilogy! It's in blu-ray and affordable.  Can't go wrong with that.
B008RJ6TTC|5.0|Instead of filling up my dvr I decided to purchase this set and I love it. Anyone who loves Lt. Columbo should get this - the price is right!

B008RXYOKY|3.0|What isn't made clear in much of the online info is that to use this adapter, you must have a Thunderbolt-equipped Mac. Don't expect to buy a Thunderbolt drive and use this adapter to connect it to an older Mac via FW800, because the adapter isn't equipped to do that. Oh well...
B003JTHXOK|2.0|I know many people love his books but I will not be downloading another of his in the near future. The characters were well developed but I did not enjoy his writing style, sorry
B004SBX112|3.0|The game itself is good - in the tradition of the other Angry Birds games. But backing up the scores is not possible. I just had to reload my phone to factory settings and my scores are gone. This makes me much less likely to want to start all over again and risk losing my scores once again.
B0038LB4TE|5.0|Jack Reacher is made to live and breath out of the pages. He is neither friend nor foe. I fights for justice and truth.
B000FA5STS|5.0|Loved this book, loved the multi plots and the cool characters! Going to read more of his books. Can't wait to start the next one.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|The packing and of course the movie arejust perfect. If you like the movie and want to add it to your collection, don't hesitate on buying it.
B00A1EOBJQ|5.0|I love the show Nashville & the music & think it is one of the best on TV now.  It amazes me how the people &#34;acting&#34; in the show are all able to sing so well & they do the songs justice.  I could listen to this music over & over.....Great job & I hope they keep it up.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As usual, Grisham has left me late for meetings, lacking in sleep, and lagging at work. An easy, but interesting and entertaining read!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Really good study plans.  Would highly recommend. Easy to use and read.  Great for devotional use also. Works great on my kindle.
B00992CF6W|3.0|its a great and fun game. However, you cant actually play survival cuz it still has a few unlimited items. And the whole point of minecraft is survival mode. I know a better app which is cheaper, better, and is much more like the real minecraft. Its called survivalcraft.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|The reason I gave it such a low mark is that it makes me sick. No I mean REALLY makes me sick. I had to take it off my device because every time I tried to play it I got sick to my stomach and wanted to vomit. I am sure it has something to do with my brain workings and I would have enjoyed it I think if I could have played it.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I loved this book the whole time I was reading it if u haven't read this book u need to !!!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Ripped through this book in one day. I am not one to enjoy or read &#34;romance novels&#34; but this book really took me by surprise . Read Read Read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book just wouldn't let me put it down it just kept me on the edge of me seat the whole time I was reading it !!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun and keeps you motivated. I also enjoy the fact they allow you to email the support group. The option is in the game and easy to find.Graphics are also pretty decent.
B0060MYM7O|2.0|I'm not sure if this was a widespread problem from Amazon's stock of preorder copies, but mine did not have the insert for the digital copies. Normally this wouldn't bother me, I rarely use them, but I was looking forward to loading them on my tablet to take with me.<br /><br />Oh well...
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|once again Bocelli has an albulm that you can listed to over and over again.  With the mix of singers it keeps your interests and allows good memories to flow...Bravo Bocelli
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is really fun, but I get bored really easily, but when I'm not in la la land, it is one of the best and most entertaining games that I have on my kindle.
B007REV4T8|4.0|Like the supporting Actor as well and felt the casting was great.  Adel's song was perfect and she deserved winning the award for it.  I will miss &#34;M&#34; however no problem with a change but not sure I like the new one at all, will have to wait and see.  If you like james Bond you will like Skyfall and all should see it....will watch it again at another time.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Awesome! Awesome! Awesome! You will never see it coming!! These characters will stay with you for a long time! Amazing!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is an incredible writer. I loved the way he built each character up, so it felt like I knew each of them! What an emotional and impressive plot and conclusion. I'm looking forward to the next one.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|This was the first on-line movie I viewed and it was GREAT!, I watched with my son and we both really enjoyed the movie. I would reccomend this movie to my friends. A lot of &#34;old school&#34; kung fu action.
B00BF11STU|1.0|Lots of action but the ambivalent to condoning use of torture by Americans is a real turn off. Don't recommend.
B0054S6N04|4.0|Another great read by Linda Howard, however, the ending felt very rushed. The story line was laid out so well, it's a shame a little extra attention wasn't given to the finale. Still, it was worth the purchase, and I highly recommend it.
B00A89ITZG|4.0|While this book takes the principals of CrossFit to the endurance relm and this procedure is original, sports help books like this have been around for decades.<br />The concept of CrossFit endurance is yet unproven so at best this is a good intro to CrossFit.<br />I love CrossFit and use the book to guide me through exercises unique to it. Further the endurance sports drills are helpful. I recommend this book to any endurance athlete looking to improve speed and strength. But the endurance aspect is missing in this book.<br />Would have been a 5 star review if the concept of CrossFit endurance was believable
B00ADQ7JCS|2.0|I bought this CD on a whim and with high hopes of something new to listen too from the world of progressive rock. One of the reasons for the purchase was the fact that Steve Hackett was a guest performer for Lifesigns. The album is progressive rock....but it never ascends to any real high point. If your expecting Genesis, Yes, Porcupine Tree, Big Big Train.. etc.....this band doesn't do it! This is not to say that there isn't talent here! They do put together effort...it just doesn't gel for me! My thoughts are that there are no strengths in the music. No highs or lows...no real variations. The singing doesn't really go anywhere! I was quite disappointed really with the whole thing. The album artwork is beautiful though...They did the packaging right. Bottom line for me...some tweaking and this band could be a contender in progressive rock in the future.
0425252868|2.0|A HIGHER CALL is a well-written and engaging tale from the European air war. It is classified as a \\"History\\" and \\"Biography.\\"  The historical parts, no doubt contributed by the historian, Adam Makos with  the biography written by the journalist, Larry Alexander, a published biographer. The \\"biography,\\" -at least most of it-- comes from interviews with the historian simply placing the personal stories in context to the war. Alexander, using an exceptional amount of quoted dialogue, does add to the story to some extent but  sources are limited. The prime source is  Stigler with  Brown in a secondary role.  Both pilots died in 2008.<br /><br />  The thrust of Franz Stigler's story, as he tells it and what is told about him,  is that the moral compass of German pilots and the Luftwaffe was superior to those of the U.S. Army Air Forces (AAF).  In addition to Stigler's response to \\"a higher call\\" he enhances the character of the Germans while denigrating Americans with examples both silly and serious: Luftwaffe fighter pilots claim a \\"victory\\" upon destroying an enemy aircraft, Americans a \\"kill.\\" \\"(Americans) would strafe a stray dog if they could.\\"Germans were ordered not to fire at an enemy in a parachute. American pilots and gunners, however, were \\"known\\" to kill the helpless enemy and pilots were warned that American fighters would also strafe them on landing when entangled in their parachutes: perhaps there were such incidents on both sides but I suspect these were the exception, not the practice. And finally, a Luftwaffe squadron commander is quoted as declaring \\"the Allies weren't `the enemy.' They were merely 'the opponent.'\\" Just a game, of course, not unlike soccer.<br /><br />  Adam Makos with Larry Alexander have produced a dramatic story presented in a very attractive package with excellent photographs. Unfortunately, however, the personal story of Franz Stigler and the World War II Luftwaffe is not based upon diligent research, but upon the memories and imagination of self-serving individuals. Every historian and every journalist has the inherent responsibility to be skeptical (as should readers) of what people say about themselves.  This doesn't negate  A Higher Call as an engrossing story and it might even rate a high grade -as a historical novel.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Its good,sometimes it gets pretty boring. You barely do anything. But its a good game when you want a boring game.  :)  Its cool,good,and i don't know.  LOL
B001NLL93W|4.0|It may have been a little bit predictable at some points, but I truly enjoyed reading it. It was a very good ending to this first trilogy.<br />I'd recommend it without hesitation.<br />There's still something about this that hasn't turned me into a raving fangirl, but I guess I'm kinda close to that... The only thing is I don't know if I should continue with the rest of the TMI saga, as I haven't heard the nicest things about books 4 or 5. We'll see.<br />For now, I can say that these first 3 books are great!
B008I3RARW|1.0|I hate this game and I did not even have to pay for it! Condolences to whoever actually paid for this pos.
B001NLKZUA|4.0|I enjoyed it very much. I love how different parts of the story are written from various characters' points of view. It really makes the story 'richer' for the reader.<br />Very good 'ending'/epilogue. It leaves you wanting to read the next one.
B0006HBZXS|5.0|This movie was all I expected Quality was exceptional and I would recommend this movie to anyone who like anthony Hopkins
B003Z0BWRM|4.0|I didn't really want to read this serie-- I saw a recommendation by Stephenie Meyer on the cover and ran away from it, since I really don't like Twilight, but I'm glad I overcame that stupid prejudice and gave TMI a shot. They say: don't judge a book by its cover; but I'd add: don't judge a book because there's a mention of an author you dislike on the cover.<br />TMI CoB: Very good and entertaining!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The story is fantastic.  The characters have developed in a way that I would never have thought of and I can't wait until I see season three.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Entertaining and well-written.  I always look forward to picking it up at night.  I do recommend to others.  The end.
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|There are funny moments, but are very far between the EXTREMELY predictable storyline. It is basically another version of Family Guy, as Seth Mcfarlane compiles the his three voices (for Brian, Stewy and Peter) into Ted, with the SAME EXACT HUMOR. McFarlane is a one-trick pony with a shortening life-span.<br /><br />They force 2 gay characters into the script, that have absolutely nothing to do with the story. But its today's Hollywood, so what do you expect... The drug use is also unneeded. Wahlberg is very wrong for the role he plays but must've needed quick cash.<br /><br />People who gave this film a 5-star rating no nothing about comedy or original story telling.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Its a good game in its own right,  but after playing games like farmville it left much to be desired. the graphics are pretty good. choice sellection is poor and what buged me the most was that once you put down a road...that was it. you can only add or delete with no return value. I would like to see that changed so you can move the roads around.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! it is a great game for when your sick or you have a snow day. I think you should get this game!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This show is simply the greatest show in the history of shows. It has everything; Love, hate, sex, greed, laughter, sympathy, the house of the undying, and leaves you craving more. I am re-watching seasons 1 & 2 before the premier of season 3 and I love it even more than the 1st time.
B0046W5E0Y|4.0|This was an excellent movie for my 2 year old granddaughter. She sat intently and was thoroughly engaged. The story was good for parents as well, showing how sometimes we can learn from the children. I enjoyed and would definitely recommend it for anyone with young children.
B004XJRQUQ|1.0|After sticking with it through the full trilogy, I can confidently say that The Hunger Games series is a waste of time.<br /><br />The plot throws you just enough decent supporting characters and genuine moments to keep you hanging on, craving some sort of satisfying resolution. Nope. The first two books were largely forgettable, and the third, utterly senseless and at times painful to sit through.<br /><br />**SPOILERS**<br /><br />The trilogy's reluctant hero, Katniss, is the weakest and most disappointing part of the series. During the first book I was taken aback by how dull, unobservant, and generally disagreeable Katniss was. The second books did little to further endear her. In in the third book whenever Katniss manages a mature or inspired moment we can only assume that her time in the Games left her with a case of multiple personality disorder. Throughout the series you continually expect Katniss to emerge from her fog of self loathing and pity to blossom into the confident, inspiring young woman constantly eluded to. Yet instead of coming out the other side of her tribulations a diamond, Katniss degenerates into a drug riddled, endlessly tragic basket case- too emotionally and mentally crippled even to feed herself.<br /><br />While I disliked the series in general, the end of Mockingjay is a disaster. In an attempt to distract the reader from the fact that she really has no good plan for how to end her train wreck of a story, the author simply starts pouring on the blood in the hopes that it will serve as placeholder for a resolution.<br /><br />Lastly I have to touch on the sad attempts at a love triangle in which Katniss is, of course, the object of desire. In the end Katniss's choice of paramour is more of a haphazard gravitation of sorts, motivated by mental instability and a lack of ability to make meaningful emotional decisions. Apparently the underlying message of the series is supposed to be that love is important.<br /><br />Sweet, futile catharsis. It will never cease to amaze me how many people love these books. Take my word for it- go read something else.
B008LG6SXS|4.0|I chose my hotels for an upcoming trip to Spain through Booking.com.  I like the filter options and the fact that photos are plentiful.  I also like that I can get the app on my Kindle to keep track of my reservations.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|This is the first time I have watched Harry Potter.  I viewed this series with my two great granddaughters who are 6 and 10.  They looked forward to each video.  I really enjoyed being able to watch the whole series
1250027624|4.0|Really enjoyed getting to know the folks at Downton Abbey....gives really great insight on just what drives some of these folks....and their backgrounds really come into play at a new level.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I like Denziel Washington.  I have seen most of his work and have never been disappointed.  He is very versatile
B00BP0MF7K|5.0|What a beautiful book!  Harold does what many of us only think about - he acts on an idea without any forethought.  What follows is his journey to understanding his life and the people he loves.  This book celebrates memory and the idea that we do matter - that our relationships matter.  The writing is lovely and the characters became so appealing over the course of the story.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good for the kids they love to play all these games and they are educational for them as well enjoy
B004SIIBGU|2.0|I found myself going to my laptop because I couldn't get all information on my account information page. Very frustrating.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I enjoy watching my minions kill the zombies! Wish gold dropped more often.... otherwise very addictive. More fun than flying birds attacking pigs!
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|I like using website better. I don't particularly know why. It just doesn't feel as comfortable. Just not like home
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Definitely worth it. One of the best games  that I've played in a while on the kindle fire. Must get.
B006TJXZ30|2.0|I'm having a hard time figuring it out. I'm only getting current incoming mail. It might just be a setting, but not quick made a auto figure out
B0089EHWQE|3.0|A naive girl who lead a sheltered life in a small village lands a job with a rich family.  She takes care of their handsome quadriplegic son.  Despite his limitations he expands her view of the world and she brings him out of his depression.  A tale of love and the determination to follow your own path.
0062082353|5.0|I can't believe he's gone BUT I know were he is with the Lord Jesus. He was a great brother. God bless Chris Kyles true frinds
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Really liked the book. At times I had to put it down because it became too much with the drugs. However, things like drugs and cutting are  real  problems today. Really kept my interest and couldn't wait to see who was the murderer.
076780421X|3.0|The disk hung up briefly on several occasions but that may be something that will go away now that the disk hasbeen played this once
B006LSZECO|4.0|A unique psychological puzzle. A Who Done It, with a bizzare twist! Your mind will change a number of times, and get totally blown away at the end!
B001TH16DS|5.0|My son-in-law loved this as one of his Christmas gift! Plan on buying more of the series. Couldn't be happier!
B00AZM7IQC|5.0|This will appeal to those who watch great videos because of the technology or simply like a well done presentation.  The experience is best on a big screen with a great sound system.  As the story goes through a series of vinettes showcasing current Las Vegas acts, one is just hooked at what they are seeing and hearing.  The effects are stunning, the actors are incredible, and the story is compelling.  Well done and well worth the cost.  This is a video you could watch over and over again when your friends come over and want to see the lastest best videos that are out there.  This is one that stands the test of time.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this series they kept me reading just trying to figure out what was going to happen next. Great read
B0052RDHTM|5.0|The Pillars of the Earth was the first book I read by Ken Follett. It became my favorite. He does that same masterful magic in this one. He makes the characters come to life, creates a story that makes you feel like your a part of and educates you without you even realizing it.
B0081SPK0I|5.0|My child spent several hours playing this game. I think it is one of their favorites.  It was nice to find an app she truly had no complaints with.
B008I3RARW|2.0|Really glad this was the free app of the day. Not worth a dime let alone $4.99. Very limited gameplay and for some reason it keeps flipping upside down on me? Deleting it as soon as I finish this review.
B00A6D5GBE|4.0|My daughter loved playing this game. She says it was a challenge for her. She loved the graphics and background music a lot. I would recommend this for kids 6 and up. Younger children may need help.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|And best of all: the story is not propelled by anyone acting stupidly or out of character (as is common in this genre)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics as are so nice and it's very creative.<br />I think if I could I'd play all day and all night. My friend recommended I played this as so I did. Love it.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love it but it needs an update. They have to add wolves,ocelots,herobrine,a jungle biome,and we need to breed things. You guys need to fix bugs like I got a whole butt load if diamond and when I came back on... it was gone. WE NEED AN UPDATE. We also want servers and invite people from different places by game center.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is very addicting but can get a little boring after you defeat the missions. Definately would recommend to other people.
B003NRYMZQ|4.0|This is the &#34;adult&#34; version of Doctor Who. They chase monsters.... and each other. I wouldn't recommend this for children, but for adults it is entertaining.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|All three books together were great. Recommend these books. A must read series. The last book was a little more slow in pase, but a good read.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Great read!! I was really impressed and couldn't put it down. Wonderfully written and so entertainingMoving on to book three.
B004VRK436|5.0|Actually, but this movie for the sheer fun of it. You kids (probably younger than say 13) will really enjoy this heart touching movie about two brothers learning to bond , while playing a fantastic game called Zathura. Adults will enjoy this with their kids.<br />There is even a play along game EXTRA on the disc, which is really cool. At least it was for my 6 yr. old granddaughter.<br />The other EXTRAS, are equally enjoyable, especially the one in the making of this movie.<br />You won't go wrong with this purchase.
0385344333|5.0|Another great Jack Reacher story.  Love the character and the action.  Recommend to anyone and everyone who likes a good action adventure.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Ah, this certainly has brought back many fond memories.  And I'm so happy with how easy it is to play on my new Kindle!  :)
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I recently saw the movie. I must say the movie was not even close in awesomeness. I completely and totally recommend both.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Perfect for my kindle fire.  It's light weight yet protects the screen when the kindle is traveling in my purse or the car.  I can't really get the folding stand to work, but I couldn't probably break it in and get it to work if I wanted to.<br />  For the price it's just fine, good protection while not adding to the weight and/or size of the kindle.  Plus I like the bright pink color.  I can find my kindle before I can find my black phone every time!
B0033807C2|5.0|I loved this book so much that when I finished it I was so upset that there weren't anymore to read, as this is the last of the series. Anyone who adores the Percy Jackson series, I have to tell you... This will be your favourite out of them all.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|you won't find it in this album. not that she is hard to look at, but she has always had such style and class. i own most of her studio albums and considered her about the classiest act around, but this album absolutely sucks. how someone who can mesmerise with a song like a blossom fell, to name just one, can make such a soulless collection of drivel is incredibly disappointing. one can only hope it was just a bad day and she will get back to what she does best and reclaim her class. i threw this one away, i wouldn't even regift it.
B008I3RARW|2.0|FIRST & foremost, controls were quirky, the throttle was just a broke joke, like one of those games my son and myself SHOULD have been able to play, but the lack of responsiveness and the sucky throttle just wouldn't let us use it effectively, not to mention lack of tracks to run.  2/5 stars only because there wasn't a 1.5 star!<br /><br />Anyone want details other than what I posted?  Well, this is all I have to offer.  This is NOT a good game to invest in, even for a free one, this was not worth it. I got this for free on the Amazon \\"Free App of the Day\\" and glad I didn't pay for it.  It has since been deleted from my device, as well as my cloud storage.<br /><br />Even my video game savvy 13 year old said \\"Mom, this game is really bad.\\" and there you have it.  Not the exact worst, but most definitely NOT anywhere near acceptable.
B000NA28I4|5.0|Love this movie and love this vendor. Got it for a good price and I will continue to use this vendor for future purchases.
B00355L2TU|5.0|I have been doing this with some weight work for chest and shoulders ... Have lost  45 pounds so far. She'll kick your butt. Good work out. Only 20 minutes a day. That's it. Wonderful . I have tried a few others also but this is my fav of hers so far.
B004EPYZSK|5.0|Love this movie and love this vendor. Got it for a good price and I will continue to use this vendor for future purchases.
B005LAIH9K|2.0|I ordered this movie and it came today on time but it was not exactly what i ordered! This is just the bluray & dvd copy! The one i ordered was a bluray,dvd,ultraviolet,digital copy!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I am a big Grisham fan. I love all his books. I will continue to be a fan and will continue to order all of his books.
B004R9EYS4|4.0|This movie was bought as a gift for a family member and she has not received it yet from me.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Love this movie and love this vendor. Got it for a good price and I will continue to use this vendor for future purchases.
B009E3EWPI|4.0|I am yet to listen to the cd's, but I have a lot of Zeppelin music. The dvd is awesome....can Jimmy play the guitar or what. Of course, he is one of the best ever to grace this planet ( his makeup is a little much) . Robert's voice is on target and Jason playing in place of his dad is great!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game allows me to have fun. It is so awesome I can't Imagine not playing it. I recommend this game to anyone who likes to have fun!!!!!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|As soon as I purchased the Mark of Athena, I was pulled into the story. As usual, I was up till practically midnight reading. As soon as I got to when Annabeth was facing Arachne, I COULD NOT PUT THE BOOK DOWN! Although the ending was a cliffhanger, I thoroughly enjoyed the book. The characters are realistic and vivid, and you can start to see the teammates starting to trust each other and work together (especially Jason and Percy!) I was on the edge of my seat for the whole story. Get this book!!!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|This book was well written and a very easy read. I liked gone girl more but I would recommend this book to any mystery fan.
B0053TMP24|4.0|I loved this book.... Percy is one of my all time favorite book characters. The plot was quick- paced and entertaining, with a dose of the authors humor.
B008I3RARW|5.0|Ok, first of all, I always get free apps of the day, so I got this. Second of all, I don't see what everyone thinks is wrong with this game. It's really fun. I always come in first place. I think it's one of the fourth best games in the world, beside Sims free play and temple run 1 and 2. And also where's my water, but not the point. This game is really fun.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|(Spoilers!)<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />Katniss has gone from being confident, proud, and determined to hiding in closets, getting drunk, and trying to become a social outcast.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />Katniss faces many personal and emotional challenges (getting over Prim and Cinnas' deaths, killing President Coin, facing President Snow again, rescuing Peeta, etc) as well as learning just how deep the treachery in the Capital can go.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Enjoy all of the books by Nicholas Sparks and this was no different.  Recommend seeing movie (if you plan to) before reading book.  Both were very good but there were a lot of differences.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is an amazing young adult book with the perfect amount of romance, science fiction elements, and breathtaking descriptions. I found Katniss to be a witty, loveable character with a believable personality.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|I strongly reccomend watching with sons. Daughter's also but especally sons. Daughters so they know what kind of men they should look for and men so they know what ind of men they should be.
B004LQGXLE|5.0|This is simply my favorite western of all time and one of the quintessential roles for each of these great American actors.  Add on top of that the supporting cast and a Burt Bacharach song that is for the ages and what else can you say?  Well, that ought to do it.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|I liked how it had a lot of videos but the quality of it was bad. and it would freeze for ten minutes then play for another 30 seconds and freeze again. I deleted it. just save yourself time and don't download it.
1594202842|5.0|Amy is a brave mother for sharing her personal information around the world, knowing there will be negative critism from the book.  She is an intelligent person, as a mother , I sometimes doubt wheter if i am too harsh on my children, deep inside I believe if you do something you should do your best. Don't let anyone influence your decision, especially living in America, what we need are more dicipline and hard working,  which is this book about, inspiring mothers raise successful children. The book might be a little too dramatic, but makes it more interesting to read.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|I found this show and watched it out of boredom. The first season was scary and I covered my eyes a lot. Season 2-8 =amazing. I had no idea i liked sci-fi until I started watching this show. Each episode is deep and unpredictable. I also love the brotherly loyalty-to death and everywhere else!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever I must say. Totally adicted! Its appropriate for people of all ages is also an advantage to this brilliant game!
030758836X|5.0|I gave 5 stars because Gone Girl was a page turner. I realize some people can't connect with the characters as well as others. I thought I was like Amy...until she got super crazy and then she turned into an &#34;old&#34; friend of mine. I could picture the obsessive recon etc and it made me miss her (my ex friend) hahaha. I totally related to this book and I loved the ending. It's true, life is a little boring without those crazy people!<br />Also, this book kept me on my toes. I had no idea what was going to happen...it was so NEW and unpredictable. I'm not sure another book will ever satisfy me again!
B0015KO52S|5.0|Even five years after its release date, \\"Consolers of the Lonely\\" remains incredibly current. The mix of genres, variety of song types, and quality of every track on this album sets it apart from any other CD I have purchased. Although I can honestly say I love every song on this album, my personal favorites are \\"You Don't Understand Me\\" with its hauntingly beautiful piano line, \\"Old Enough\\" which has a cool, Beatles-esque vibe mixed with folk rock, \\"The Switch and the Spur\\" with a country-alternative feel, and \\"Carolina Drama,\\" a bluesy song depicting an intense story about a young boy. Every track released by The Raconteurs has a unique sound. The artistry of this group of musicians, led by Jack White, is extremely impressive and entertaining. I have had this album on repeat for the past several weeks, and I still manage to find an even deeper layer of musicianship every time I listen to it. The instrumentation, the lyrics, the unique sound, everything about this album is phenomenal. I HIGHLY recommend this purchase.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|My kids love it! We watch every night at bedtime and I got it for a good price too.  Thanks
B009AXXI52|5.0|I love this collection of beautiful songs ,some were never released. I enjoyed being able to listen to each brother Gibb and when you listen you can hear how close their voices resembled each other in some of their song.  I want say this is one of the best collection of all the brothers Gibbs I own.  RIP Andy, Maurice and Robin
B004J4XGN6|5.0|A very approachable discussion of the author's philosophy and approach.  lots of examples and practical advice.  I am sure that I will be applying his principles.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I do love Denzel and have watched and enjoyed most of his movies.  This one is a bit different.  First, the plane crash was not realistic.  Secondly, though I hoped he would turn his life around, he did so in a not so appealing manner.  Truth is, the ending lacked...tremendously.  I appreciate DW's entice presentation and devotion to his work.  I also liked how the other main character held her own and did such a great job (better than he did, IMO).  No spoilers here...just my two cents.
B0067DBHBU|5.0|It's Daughtery!! Need I say more? Just goes to show you dont have to be an Idol winner to make it!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|David Bowie once again proves that he is one of the few relevant rock musicians from the distant past! This album rocks, takes chances all over the place and essentially has no commercial potential! It's just a shame that David hasn't done this at least every two years! IF the first three songs don't get you, then you have no pulse. The title song is killer, the production is impeccable and the Morphine-like saxes throughout are fantastic, and the 7th song, &#34;If You Can See Me&#34; is so far off kilter from the opening screeches right through to the end that it is down right astounding.Wind that mother up, and let it rip! Thanx David!!!!
B00AK0X5VQ|3.0|Basically a simplified version of the cell stage from the game Spore. It's pretty, and it's relaxing, but for me a bit repetitive. If you are a very casual gamer you'll probably love it.
B00280LYIC|4.0|The book was quick and enjoyable to read. I didn't feel the author spent a lot of time on establishing the details but he provided enough of a back story to make the characters relatable.
B009NYF2ES|2.0|Although I enjoyed the storyline, it was the quality of the DVD that I disliked.  Several times throughout the movie the movie froze or the soundtrack was off.  Not sure if I could request a replacement.
B00756GRUE|4.0|As always Seiko delivers too quality, superb movement at a very low price. I particularly loved the color combination on the bezel as well as the beautifully finished dial.<br /><br />Cons: the bracelet has this gaudy mirror finish on the centre links which makes it look very cheap, I'm thinking about buffing that out. Also, the minutes sphere is hard to read due to the thicker hands on the dial.
B00BP29SAA|5.0|My 3 year old daughter LOVES all the Dr Panda games. We have purchased all of them. I hope they keep coming out with more. Definitely worth the money.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|this game is tub but after a while it gets boring.but when you go back to it real fun it also reminds me of mario
B001GCUO1Q|5.0|love the movie great action lets you know how he became wolverine nice movie he a great actor nice movie
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The main characters are fresh and complex and the story has plenty of turns. Well worth my snowy cold weekend.
B003UYV08E|5.0|great movie you never know what iron man is up to he is a nut movie was great action movie
B000R9J3XE|5.0|This band has a unique sound and lyrics. Shirley Manson is the best. Sexy, sultry, and sometimes downright irresistible. Highly recommended.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|i like this app but its really bugish<br /><br />for one thing i hate the headstarts. so wen i get them in the mystery boxes i have nothing to do with them. i wish u could sell them!!!!<br /><br />2whenever i listen to music and play this it screws up the music. i hate wen ANYONE screws up One Direction
B007HC3LHS|5.0|If you like a good suspense novel then stop what your doing and read this book!!<br /><br />This is definitely one I could read again. Here you have this normal average girl who worked during the week and enjoyed her weekends. She met this man Lee who was everything from handsome and charming to dark and sinister. Boy did he had everyone fooled. And to make it all the better, he was a cop. This man is just sick.<br /><br />As I was reading this, I thought it would make a great lifetime movie.<br /><br />Lots of twists and turns so you'll always be on the edge of your seat!!!
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Well, first of all, this is a WAR movie. If you are a sci-fi nerd who is intimidated by all things military, you need to move on. You will not like this. Apparently many reviewers of this movie fit the sci-fi geek description and, of course, they panned it. If you have a latent hatred of the USA(although what other country would allow your sorry, fleshy rear end to continue to live out your ridiculous \\"slacker-chic\\" life),you also need to move on. So, if you would like to view an excellent war movie with above average acting, fantastic action sequences and not so much foul language that you can allow your 13 yr. old to watch it, you will enjoy this movie. The combat scenes are particularly good and quite realistic. A Marine friend of mine gave it a thumbs up! Yes, this movie is VERY pro military and an unabashed love letter to the United States Marine Corps. In my book, those are very GOOD things. Semper Fi!
1554512115|5.0|Lots of laughs and a great message; girls rule! A haughty prince, a dragon, and a heroine who triumphs in the end.
B005LAII80|5.0|Saw it in theaters on a bored Saturday and was very shocked. It's brutal and beautiful and (I don't like 3D) a okay use of the gimmick although it approached silly at times. Amazing in glorious 2D in high def.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I loved this show.  It's good to see more well made Sci-fi shows out there. I just wish there was more.
B00AYDC3CG|4.0|I almost busted a gut during the PTA scene when the teacher gives a speech about science. It's also heartwarming for anyone who has lost man's best friend.
B007GE2H3G|5.0|I watched this movie on a whim but was very surprised how it pulled me in. Definitely recommend this movies to others.
B008I3RARW|1.0|Free app of the day, would not.run on my Galaxy tab 2.  Oh well.  Sounds like I didn't miss much.anyway.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Good book dealing with spousal abuse.  Most of us do not understand how hard it is to get out of a horrible abusive relationship. Would recommend this book to anyone wanting to help someone they know get help.
B009K86D86|4.0|Food, Inc was a very insightful view at what we are \\"offered\\" as food for our tables.  The film certainly gave me a new perspective on what I want to eat!
B004U52VPS|5.0|This game is the world of Angry Birds .... but in the real world!! My kids have so much fun with it and recommend it enough.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Good game real addicting. It`s like eating potato chips can`t play just one game. I would recommend this game to those that don`t like pigs.
B000ID37T0|5.0|really love it ......al pacino is alway my love  wanna see it again .<br />scent of a women . :)
B00BHMF578|4.0|Fun movie to watch.  Its quite a feat to make a movie suspenseful when you already know the outcome going before you watch it.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Pros:<br />I immediately fell in love with this bag. It held a Canon 60d+battery grip, 550ex II speedlite, 70-200mm+hood,15-85mm+hood, 50mm, 85mm+hood, Canon G9 point and shoot, deflectors, flash light and various other accessories. I really liked the velcro straps, which held the camera and 70-200mm+hood firmly in place. I liked that there were no large decals or advertising branding, with the exception of the amazon zippers.<br /><br />Cons:<br />I did not use the tripod straps, because I found it did not hold very well as it does not have a slip to slide the tripod feet into at the bottom.<br /><br />Warning:<br />I used the bag for 2.5 months until the hand strap pulled free from the seams and the pack fell to the floor. Luckily, nothing was damaged, however the seams for the shoulder straps appear to be separating a bit now.  It appears as though the nylon strap frayed until it pulled free through the seams. If they had folded and cross stitched the strap ends before sewing it into place, to avoiding the fraying, this likely would not have occurred.<br /><br />Amazon customer support was great and I'm feeling quite satisfied with the resolution.
B0063IH60K|5.0|One of my favorite apps . Use it frequently. works well , no glitches. Great time killer at the Dr office or else where.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE this game because you have to do competitions and train your horses!!!!!!! Makes me feel like I have a real horse!
B008QE9XD2|4.0|great movie even better cause the DVD comes with a ultraviolet code for the movie so i can watch it anytime i wanto on vudu app like on my PS3 or phone i gave the DVD  n box to a friend. only con is that the mvie has poor audio its not the disc or ultraviolet its the movie its just has very low volume had my speakers at 60 just to hear it.
B00065JTBA|5.0|If you are a Bon Jovi fan this is for you....it has a great mix of songs and most of which are unreleased. This is a 5 cd set, not every song is the best song ever but there is a lot of great music in this set.
B009YQJ322|3.0|i buyt the movie on DVD cause i know its not worth buying on blu ray the movie sucks compared to the stallone judge dredd tho the plus side is that the DVD version comes with a ultraviolet code so i can watch this movie on my PS3 throw vudu and give the disc n box to a friend.
159315724X|5.0|I am going to give a copy to every person I know who appears to want to make some kind of improvement in their life.
B009NQKPUW|1.0|its a prequel thing as well as a story thing it ruins the alien origins for alien universe as well as the alien vs predator universe cause the way the movie goes is the first xenomorph didnt exist till after this movie but in the AVP universe the mesomorphs have been the predators favorite ultimate hunting prey for thousands of years even more so than the humans.
B0073V7YTY|4.0|fun to play with and see how loud some things really are! I downloaded this to my Android tablet and it works good.
B000ARFNNM|1.0|This purchase was a big disappointment. This movie is an old favorite and I was looking forward to having it in my movie collection. However, when I opened it and tried to watch it, the DVD wouldn't play. I guess people can even cheat you on Amazon, because most people will not go to the trouble of sending a $10 item back.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Still testing it out but looks go so far.  I'll replace my normal clock and see how it goes then I'll post again
B008I34YYY|5.0|Interesting how the reviews are all over the place for this movie. I thought it was great! I love a movie that doesn't take its self seriously and has no qualms in telling you so. Specials effects, acting and dialog where perfect considering the tone. I found myself laughing out loud several times. However, the Very End, is quite dark and sets a tone in line with  the actual history of earths warfare and humanities preparation for it.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I was completely disgusted when I found the cost of the in game purchase options.  There is an option to buy gems for $99.99.  Yes, you read that right, one wrong click, and it could cost you more than your phone.  They know this game is targeted to little kids and know the odds of a child buying the in game stuff without their parents consent.  Words cannot describe how I feel.  Did I say disgusted!?
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This series is engaging and very well done.I watch very little TV but I have become quite addicted to this series.
B002U3CCF6|5.0|Gillian Flynn is an extremely talented writer and her debut novel is a page-turning thriller with many intriguing and shocking layers.  Camille, an investigative journalist, with some horrific issues of her own, returns to her hometown to gather information on some recent murders.  She also has to confront her nastily dysfunctional family and sinister characters that seem to leap out from every corner of this town. The plot line takes several unexpected turns and finishes with, my only criticism, an ending that is a little too rushed and tidy.
B00846WWVM|4.0|This app seemed boring when I bought it, but I soon got addicted.  If deciding wether to get it or not, you should.
157421327X|3.0|Although I love the zentangle drawing it wasn't worth the price I paid for it. I was disappointed with the book.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book seemed too long to me - I was getting weary from it about 3/4 through.  It is quite the work of writing and I have to admire all the details and getting into the mind(s) of these characters.  I say Mind(s) because I actually felt it was the same person - was  expecting the end to reveal one person with multiple personalities.  I've known a scarily manipulative person or two over a lifetime, but nearly all the characters fit that description in this book.  Not enough relief in contrast throughout.<br /><br />I don't know how may pages this book has as I read it on my kindle but if felt like 400-500, which made the experience a bit like a lengthy soul bashing.  Often times a page turner and a mind bender - trying to &#34;side&#34; with one character over another - exhausting.  If you like that kind of read you will enjoy this book.
B004XUMMFE|4.0|It was a great show. Intriguing, funny, captivating. It's just too bad that the show is only one season. There are so many unanswered questions. Nevertheless, I enjoyed it and am happy I watched it.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|It was boring for the first 20 or so minutes, Heath Ledger's scarily insane performance saved this movie, what happened to the people at the party after Batman fell out of the window to save his old girlfriend leaving the people at the party to the Joker's devices?
B00AB65SVE|4.0|Seasons 1-3 of this show were gold, with this season though I feel like its lacking something...the epaiodes are good to so-so and kind of forgettable after watching them. I was dissapointed in season three when I first watched them on air but after buying them on DVD and re-watching, I had a changeel of heart so this season will probably be the same scenario. I honestly don't know how having a baby in this show will go because it's too early to tell but I'm anxious to see where they will go with it. So, I'm hanging on and I'll probably purchase this to keep my collection going but hopefully it picks up steam again. Still funny, the good messages are still there and I love all the characters...I just can't pin-point what this season is missing, or if it's just me...
0749398086|5.0|I loved this book! Very well written, and in great condition:) I highly recommend it for anyone. It has great insight on the 1930's and very interesting.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|Love this trilogy and will watch it over and over.Kate is awesome and needs to be spaked with wokfs today
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Nice game, takes some thought as opposed to the mindless repetition of most on the market. I recommend it to all
0062082353|5.0|My book arrived much quicker than originally told. For a used book, it was in fantastic shape! I'm very happy with this deal.
0618918248|4.0|Good bpok, different piontd and ideas. Proved wrong what seemed to be right, and helping people not necedsarly follow him, but make peiple confident for walking their way withput being told where to go and how to.
B00B780TAK|4.0|Definite improvement over the wandering weirdness of Season 2. Maggie Smith is right back in form. Some good plot surprises, new characters, great moments and of course all the favorites. Way too long on the prison plot but great writing on the role of the manor lord. Best stuff still happens below stairs.
B000957O82|5.0|I own this DVD at home, wanted to get a gift for a friend,  I bought 2 copies. The arrival was quick, it was packaged properly, I will purchase again from this Company.

B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is fabulous and pretty much all G5games are!It has good goals but some do ask for a bit too much! Once you have started to get high levels it takes longer for the game to boot up... I hope G5 can sort this out.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Love the show. The characters grow on you, as I did not like the choices in the beginning, but as the show goes on they get much more interesting.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|Other than the slow going later on this is an addicting and fun game. Be careful how you expand early on.
B0081336FO|5.0|Excellent show. Keeps you guessing, and makes you not want to miss a minute of it. Wish it was on all the time!!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|The game is great. It's well paced and will take a long time to beat or get all the stuff in the store. Nobody likes a fun game that is short.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|This has it's ins and outs, but I would say it is kinda hard to play &quot;challenging&quot; gameplay mostly because there are a lot of fierce mobs like the bull and<br />Coyote. I would say maybe to scale down the pressure...
B005LAIIFS|5.0|The grandkids loved it. they played with the eggs all night. Watched the movie twice. Worth the price. You wont be disappointed.
B001U3ZYVG|5.0|increibel sonido, un placer para ser oido una y otra vez , hasta el cansancio.<br />Una verdadera perla musical, .

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is a amazing app how?Well first I think its challenging but amazingly fun. I would get it also because its free and if u played the first one and u liked it just wait!!!
B009O2XY12|4.0|I have this app on my iPhone.  It's a lot of fun after a long stressful day to play on the bus or train heading home.  I thought it would be a good addition to my Kindle Fire and more fun to lay on the larger screen.  It is, but there is an important drawback: you need to have a Wifi connection to play.  So, if you're on an Amtrak train in the Northeast Corridor, you'e good to go.  If you're on Metro-North, you'e out of luck.  It's a free app and worth picking up, just be aware you may not be able to play it anytime/everywhere.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is pretty fun. It gets a little annoying with the timers that are used but other than that it is a must have.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I was a little skeptical about this game when I purchased it, but boy is it fun!  I play it almost daily on my bus commute to work.  It's a great mindless diversion to start the day.  Be cautioned, although the app is free, you can purchase upgrades, etc. with real money (not unlike the games you lay on Facebook).  But, even free play is quite enjoyable and gives me a chuckle or two.

I also forgot there really isn't as many fight scenes!  The 3D is pretty good When there is flight scenes.  I miss the loud sounds from movies back in the 80's. For the price it's a good movie.

B00B9366VO|5.0|I never knew so much work went into the making of just one song, let alone an album in that day.  What a story about a old little studio where well known groups made their start.  Good job, Dave saving the heart of the studio as it closed and bringing that magic into your home.  It was great to watch fellow performers that recorded at Sound City  jam together in your home using that special sound equipment from Sound City.  Bravo
B005CGI4EG|4.0|For the price you can't go wrong, but the packaging leaves a little to be desired.  Do yourself a a favor and buy some thin-line jewel cases, you will want to get the discs out of the box.  They are stacked on two spindles and are a bit cumbersome to sort through.
B00846WWVM|5.0|The game is different then a lot of the more popular little Android games. The game is fun and very challenging. Good game for the whole family. Winner here
B00BMUYLSE|5.0|I really like this new release. It captures something new for Bowie, yet again. I have been a Bowie fan from way, way back (Ziggy Stardust, Alladin Sane, Diamond Dogs,.. etc) and have seen him change, evolve, many times over. &#34;The Next Day&#34; shows me a more mature, aware and maybe even a sentimental David. His voice cracks often but emits more emotion. Is vocals seem less forced and more natural than before. I feel his soul in this release more than ever. I wonder what comes next...<br /><br />Well done, The Thin White Duke!..... Ziggy played guitar..............

B008ZVNC2O|4.0|Not many people could tackle the material in this collection. Mick Hucknall has that amazing, soulful voice, that serves these songs best. Really loved his version of the Ettta James classic, I'd Rather Go Blind. This is a must have for all soul music lovers!
0525948023|5.0|Should be read as a companion to Tolle's &#34;The Power of Now.&#34;  This is certainly the case, if one is committed to pulling oneself up by one's own bootstraps.

B003FXXNBW|5.0|Great fight movie very action packed. I looked for months in stores and could not find it. Very happy with purchase.
B0072OFOM6|4.0|I love the series all episodes the format if you liked Gladiator movie, don't worry you will like it. The best is season 1.
B00942G4UA|4.0|A really important documentary which examines closely where our food comes from. For me, when I read the book \\"Fast Food Nation\\" that changed the way I think about fast food and the choices I make when I buy and consume food. This movie covers a lot of the same ground in visual form. I highly recommend it so that you at least can understand and make informed choices as a consumer.
B00005QHPQ|4.0|Very Good I recomended those whose fans of Erique will love it, I have several Enrique CD's myself and this is one of his best.
B000SO7OL6|4.0|Excellent, deep (for a female) piano-bar vocals, backed by good professional arrangements and musicianship, and well recorded.<br /><br />`S Wonderful is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />I particularly liked the \\"Heart of Saturday Night\\" ... delightful familiar, down-to-earth memories of more innocent times ... really puts a smile on.  <G> ... and WELL done.  Joy !!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love playing this game. I got addicted the first time I played. It shows you a pretty realistic illness travel.
1449433251|5.0|I have been reading Calvin and Hobbes since about 8 years now and it is has become a yearly tradition for me to go through the entire set during November-December. I purchased this set to enjoy this tradition even more. The books are beautiful and the paper quality is great. I love this set.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|At 69 years of age and a former organizational leadership developer, I find this work based in strong research and real life experiences that I can reflect on with understanding--been there done-or seen that--.  This is an eye opener for both interoverts, extroverts and those inbetween-not a one sided defense but an open and pervasive discussion of behavior and its origins.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I love this cd.  All of the songs are great. I would recommend this CD to all age groups to enjoy.
B004J4WLB4|3.0|This book was emotionally a bit difficult to read.  If you are looking for light and happy reading, this might not be the best choice.  Our book club read it and we had quite a lively discussion.  There is much here to ponder.  We were amazed at all the information on the 'language of flowers' that this book contained.
B00275EHJG|4.0|I love Toy Story 3!  Great movie & so glad that this finally came in so I can enjoy it! I appreciate it! Thanks!
B004D5AJ3G|5.0|This little green sheep is smaller than expected, but my daughter loves it.  We ordered the book from which this toy was derived, and now she loves reading the book with her sheep at bedtime.
B0029LCJJS|3.0|it kinda boring,I could be wrong but I only seen half of season 1.I give it an other chance hopefully get it better
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love this game but I dont like the world tour levels! but anyway I would recemend this game to people. and if you like temple run this is better
B0082A3JHQ|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST JIMI HENDRIX LIVE RECORDINGS I HAVE EVER HEARD! I REALLY LIKE THE WAY IT STARTS OUT OF THE BAND WARMING UP AND EVERYTHING!
B004S3MB2U|4.0|Good calculator with lots of functions, easy to use, and nice display.  Best calculator i have seen out there.  Excellent
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This book was only a buck but was worth much more. I've purchased books before that cost 15 times as much but this little gem beat a lot of them. Most excellent read.
1574216988|5.0|I am enjoying this book so much as its examples inspire me to create my own Zentangle art.  Great illustrations, great ideas, great book!
B0094K1MH2|4.0|We went to see this movie with my 70+ parents--and it went well. It was a good family movie, entertaining story, enjoyable artwork, and it had some quirky humor tucked into it as well.
B0042RUMH8|5.0|What can be said about a super nova that can produce an album that will captivate you? This mix is amazing, you cannot listen to it with out moving some part of your body. The mix of songs could not be done any better.
B009CF7JDU|5.0|While the events aren't &#34;realistic&#34;...it's a fun romp of a boy idolized for skipping school in a world class &#34;Sausage King&#34; style. I enjoy that it shows familial love (and frustrations) and the loyalty of friendship. The only real &#34;damage&#34; anyone does in the story is to the car--but even that has a bit of cathartic purpose to it. Ferris is the kid that you may wish that you were... or at least that you were friends with, because he is fun.
B008BRC6NS|5.0|Get on the floor! J-Lo knows how to motivate every part of your body. This album to nothing but hot, hot , hot!! You will listen to it and the songs will not stop in your head, your feet will move you, your hips will not be still and you will get HOT!!
B009VB97EY|1.0|I could only stand to watch about half. Not a huge fan of Tatum...and while I really like McConnoughey's charm and wiry good looks--it was not enough to keep me watching. I think that if someone is teeny-aged ga-ga over Tatum and male dancers in general--they *might* find it worthwhile. Otherwise...just leave it on the shelf.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|I love this movie, for it shows how tight family is.  When two people are in love anything can be accomplished.  I have really enjoyed watching this movie.  It brings swells of joy to my heart.  I'm sure there are a lot of good guys out there who are just as good as Shawn.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Read a lot of books through the Kindle app on my iDevices.... This one was fantastic!  Excellent sense of humor, interesting science and problem solving and great fun.  Enjoy!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|What a great story from 2 members of the greatest generation! The &#34;side &#34; that they were fighting for was of no consequence....true gentlemen!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|a great and fun way to pass the time especially for the horse lover's out there. very interactive and entertaining
B00846WWVM|2.0|Sprinkle is a physics based game which resembles a top rated game. The physics engine is excellent for what it is though, it seems time management was a burden for the developer. Specifically, the controls lack refinement. I made sure to give this game adequate time to make a fair assessment. Unfortunately, my experience was not unlike many have made note of before me. I found, easily solvable stages became impossible to complete due to the inability to maneuver the water canon with much precision. On many occasions, when I attempted to rotate the canon, I was only able to raise and lower it. Other times, when I meant to raise or lower the canon, it would rotate, instead. If the game weren't played against a clock, I wouldn't have made such a fuss but due to the nature of the game, FIRE, I did. I couldn't justify spending $1.99 on a game with a flaw of this magnitude. It isn't like a sound or instruction issue. The controls are the most important function of this game or pretty much any game. It is a shame I couldn't give this game the proper rating of four or, very possibly, five stars. Instead, I was honest and gave it what it's worth. If you are contemplating the purchase of this game, I recommend contacting the developer and ask if they have corrected the controls issue. This could save you from much frustration. When the problem is finally fixed, this will definitely be a game to waste time on.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|it works fine I don't use it a lot because I'm really smart. I saw this review it said 0/1 equals zero he needs this app
B009XEE0DW|5.0|I recomment this album to everyone who loved point de suture from 2008, Mylene had finally returned to laurent and this album is solid and I can't wait for club and DJ remixes
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|This is a good story for a quick read or something that you can leave for a few days and not be lost when you pick it back up
082300659X|5.0|I really don't know how to rate this product because it is the title we were looking for. My girl does actually use the book and she says it has helped her skills a lot.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Addictive game. Wish there were more options. Some items I'm still trying to figure out, but I guess that will come with more playing
B001D0BLTA|5.0|i own on it on DVD...i watch it EVERYTIME its on tv. whats NOT to love!?! in Molly Ringwald. Duckie is just a great character. great chick flick/coming of age sort. love it...always will
0988936402|4.0|College student, Owen Sage, finds himself mysteriously switching between dimensions.  One is the the \\"normal life\\" at Easton Falls University, and the other is the \\"fantasy world\\" of Everville.  He soon learns that the two worlds are interconnected.  Owen must work with the creatures of Everville to battle the forces of evil before they cause permanent destruction to both worlds.<br /><br />Everville is very creative and full of action.  I did feel however, that it needed a good proofreading.  There were a lot of errors in spelling and grammar, and at times the point of view did not remain consistant.  I also felt more could have been done with character development.  Perhaps more dialog would have helped.  Still, it is a good read.  Everville would appeal to YA readers who enjoy fantasy and adventure.<br /><br />Note:  After this initial review, the book did get proofread. I received an updated copy.  The errors have been corrected.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I first heard The Piano Guys during an appointment with my financial advisor and she had it playing in the background.  Lest that makes them sound stuffy, it was precisely because they were so completely different from anything I'd heard before that I wanted to know if I was really hearing them accurately. I was.  Plus, the Piano Guys you hear are a pianist and a cellist.  The cellist is the &#34;spark&#34; of the group, I think.  I really don't know how to describe them.  My favorite piece involves a topless piano so they can pluck the strings, play percussion with their hands on the side of the piano from the inside, carry a beat by lightly hitting the keyboard cover to the full-up position in rhythm to, yes, someone actually playing the keys on the keyboard. For that particular piece they bring in three other &#34;piano guys&#34; who are the &#34;techies&#34; of the group.  Most of the music is played by one pianist and one cellist, both obviously well-trained and accomplished artists who wanted to see how far they could go with something beyond the usual.  Don't miss them.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|its a cute game. my kids like it. i just wish so many thinys didnt cost real money. my kids really want to be ablebto get a different horse.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|I was mesmerized by this film when I saw it in a theater and gladly pre-ordered it from Amazon before its release date.  I watched it last night for the first time at home and, even on a small screen, I was on the edge of my chair for the adventure part of the story.  It is truly an incredible film both for special effects and for content.  I also love the music and have just ordered the soundtrack CD as well.  It was also pleasant to find Amazon refunded the difference between the pre-ordered price and the actual price, which was less.  Thank you, Amazon.
B008I3RARW|2.0|This game must be under development. Its is far from a polished well constructed game. The controls are wonky and leaves the player fighting the cars steering. After playing the game six times I had enough and deleted it. This game simply needs more development.
B00006JI11|1.0|I received the product and the dvd does not work.  Tried it several times.  Am very angry because I looked forward to receiving this movie.  Had friends over to watch it.  Tried to contact seller and no reply.  I will never buy from them again.  Save your money.
B000031EGV|5.0|Amazing special effects, fun story with a &#34;happy&#34; ending as it should be with any fantasy story. Highly recommend it.
0316227706|1.0|I love these images, and I can understand the appeal in publishing a book that doesn't cost a fortune.  However, the size is just too small to do any justice.  Several of the images are printed across the binding - part of the image appears on one page and part on the other page.  Really detracts from the artistry.  Book should be larger, and the images should be published one to a page possibly with blank space surrounding some if not all.  Very disappointing.  It's more enjoyable looking at these images full frame on the web than it is in this penny pinching book.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A very entertaining, believable science fiction story which makes you want the characters to succeed. Genuinely laughed out loud at several points in the book and lost sleep because I didn't want to put it down. Great read, thank you Mr. Weir! ( . )  ( . ) indeed...
1451695195|5.0|I just finished reading this book and it was personally life-changing.  Dr. Alexander had a truly amazing experience and had the courage to go public.  I have worked in health care, with patients in hospitals and clinics, for over 35 years.  I clearly remember a physician who years ago said that as a doctor the disease that most frightened him, struck fear in his heart, was meningitis. I have seen those frightening cases but thankfully not too many. I have been a Christian since childhood. When my Father was dying I started reading NDE accounts as I was facing his loss. Attempts to explain the \\"visions or experiences\\" as illusions or the response of a dying brain have been advanced.  Those present at a death bed have recounted the sense of the spirit leaving the body. Alexander's account is unique. It was now from a scientist who had worked all his professional life with and on the brain.  Who better to show heaven to than a scientist? A non-believer. There are many in the science and medical fields who are Christians, who still believe in the spiritual, in God, and in the power of faith. Science and faith in God and higher consciousness can co-exist.  This experience shows that.  In recent decades more areas of medicine have arisen that acknowledge the spiritual role in healing and in life.  Thankfully, doctors are praying for their patients, and using the power of the human mind on many levels to restore health. Those of us who work daily in the medical field, who study science, the workings of the human brain and body, who can relate to Dr. Alexander's background, realize that many of his associates and colleagues would have the same doubts he previously had about a hereafter. Yet he came forward--reading the book you will see how he had to share his experience. Scientists want to find the facts, a material explanation for life and consciousness.  Going public Dr. Alexander met with much skepticism from many in the medical field.  I thank God for him. On a very personal level for me he helped greatly to restore my faith at the darkest time in my life, the first death of a younger sibling from metastatic breast cancer, and when it reached the brain it quickly claimed her. She too was a Christian and very spiritual.  Her death shook my faith to the core, even as she looked forward to heaven and the reunion with loved ones. She felt herself held in Jesus' arms as he comforted her, like her Dad had comforted her as a child. As I struggle through my grief, his \\"Proof of Heaven\\" has helped to change my life dramatically.  This book can help put life and physical death, and the hereafter, in perspective. Thank you, Dr. Eben Alexander III! I will be forever grateful.

B000026I8U|5.0|This album is incredible.  Manu Chao's sound is unique, playful and timeless.  I have it in the car for daily listening and it does not get old.  I would recommend it for any well versed music lover.
1597801585|4.0|I'm not a big fan of science fiction novels but this book was a selection of my book discussion group so I decided to give it a try and boy, I'm I glad I did. Its a really  fun, exciting read set in Thailand in the near future. At its core, the story offers a warning about letting genetics run amok. It features a large cast of characters in a world rampant with food diseases, mastadon-like creatures and sex clubs with genetically engineered windup girls. There's lots of action, political double crosses and even a mad scientist. The book won both the Hugo and Nebula awards and I would highly recommend it, not just to fans of science fiction, but to anyone who just enjoys a good story with some worthwhile, thought provoking elements.
B002N7CTKM|4.0|I purchased certain episodes from first season and no more.  This show could have done so many things better.  Oh well, that's tv today for ya!
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Being able to recognize the myriad of video game characters that younger viewappear in Wreck-It Ralph is less critical to the story. It's a blast for fans of video games to spot the cameos, but the film's story and original characters are strong enough so that you really don't need to be a gamer to appreciate it.<br /><br />Wreck It Ralph is, at its core, a story about middle age crisis: a big lug who has been doing the same job for years with little or no positive recognition starts to question his life and future. He has anger issues. He goes into therapy with other video villains, including Satan (\\"That's pronounced '\\"Sa-teen,'\\" he says). All that's missing from his journey is a trip to Human Resources.<br /><br />In Toy Story, Woody worried about being replaced. Wreck It Ralph asks, with apologies to Peggy Lee, \\"Is that all there is?\\" His character arc is very believable and touching, but never sentimental.<br /><br />Most of the film takes place in a blindingly colorful game called Sugar Rush, shown off to good advantage in Blu-ray. Clever gags abound: castle Oreo cookie soldiers who sing \\"Or-ee-O, Yo-oh;\\" a pit of Nestle's Quik sand; attacks by barking Devil Dogs...it goes on and on. I like the brightness, after decades of bleak, realistic fantasies.<br /><br />The Blu-ray disc contains all the bonus features, which, considering what a rich film this is, are not as generous as one might wish (no feature length commentary). The DVD disc, though, does include the Oscar-winning short, Paperman.<br /><br />WRECK IT RALPH BLU-RAY/DVD FEATURES<br />(also available with 3-D Blu-ray & Digital Copy)<br /><br />Blu-ray Bonus Features:<br />* Paperman theatrical short<br />* Bit By Bit: Creating the World of Wreck-It Ralph<br />* Disney Intermission: The Gamer's Guide to Wreck-It Ralph<br />* Deleted and Alternate Scenes<br />* Video Game \\"Commercials\\" for Fix-It Felix, Jr., Hero's Duty and Sugar Rush<br /><br />DVD Bonus Feature:<br />* Paperman theatrical short
B004R13U6Y|5.0|The new text flow page orientation is great!  I use the double column view and it flips the pages like the Nook.  So instead of side loading the nook, I just bought this app.  I wasn't disappointed, did I mention that it reads aloud for you.  So when my eyes are tired I simply change it's setting to read to me.  Easy to pull up my docs, text, pdf files, etc. Keep up the good work.
B00AO686MY|5.0|When I first saw Who Framed Roger Rabbit in 1988, it was like an epiphany. While the combination of live action and animation was and still is remarkable (and astonishingly great considering that the effects were all optical and pre-digital), what resounded with me was the cartoon characters cameos and the grand assemblage of them all together (I won't spoil it for those who have not seen it).<br /><br />I and many fellow animation enthusiasts felt vindicated for all those years of what some termed \\"baby stuff.\\" Animation was hip, cartoons were now cool and Steven Spielberg was buying cels. Roger Rabbit the film became a benchmark for animation for every age, especially adults who grew up with it and wanted to see it aimed at them.<br /><br />Thus came The Simpsons and copycats that imitated both Roger and Homer. There were cartoons for kids, cartoons for grownups and a new \\"golden age\\" at Disney, where now-classics like Beauty and the Beast delighted everyone. Many of the artists -- and there were TONS of them -- cut their teeth on the huge international effort that went into producing Who Framed Roger Rabbit and went on to greater successes on their own.<br /><br />So how does it look now? Gorgeous on Blu-ray, particularly the Toontown sequence, but also even the darker scenes take on a luster and sheen because every detail is defined. It holds up quite well, not as shockingly adult as it seemed to parents back in 1988, as compared to today, with far more racy scenes and strong language more prevalent in mainstream media, even \\"family\\" films and TV.<br /><br />It seems likely that many of the cartoon characters who pop up in Who Framed Roger Rabbit may become more and more obscure, sadly, except to animation and Disney buffs. Several generations have missed out on regular TV viewings of classic cartoons, so the character cameos do not all have the impact they had back in '88. It's like watching Around the World in 80 Days today with people who are only familiar with the here and now. They may not know David Niven, much less Cantinflas, and the star-studded parade they encountered in what was a sensation in its day.<br /><br />WHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT BONUS COMPARISONS<br /><br />The new Who Framed Roger Rabbit package includes bonus features from the 2003 Vista Series release, but mostly on the Blu Blu-ray disc.

B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Kill apps and caches quick.  Does everything I need help me save battery life on my Fire.  I plan to upgrade.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|Great book exiting adventure worth every penny. I gave it five stars couldn't pull my nose out of this book, once again great buy!
B0083B3KOQ|5.0|I bought it to easily convert my music files for the Kindle Fire.  Awesome app, it was easy to do just that, I put them in the drop box from my computer and phone then pulled them through the converter.  Not only will it convert music files but also docs, etc. You will not be disappointed with this app.  Worth the price, it does what it says.
B00AE2I4WK|4.0|I'd like to give it 4.5 stars, holding back 1/2 a star for some slow spots in the plot.  The choreography was diverse and superb.  The scenery was good.  We rented it and are now buying it.  Enjoyable movie.
B007W4OZ76|5.0|I didn't expect this much from the explorer, easier to get to all files even the root directory.<br />Put this on my Kindle Fire.
B0045XICB2|4.0|I like it. It keeps my attention, with its surprising twists and turns. Even my family liked it. We are waiting for all the rest.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book!! Could not stop reading it!! Best book i have ever read!! Deffanitly is a winner!! Good job!
B001UTW7QU|4.0|The characters really grow on you as they develop.  Each episode adds a clue to the overall story.  We enjoy it.
B007HC3LHS|3.0|Started out good and got even in the middle better but ended with a whimper! It could've ended so many different ways and I have  to say, I was a little disappointed with it. Worth 2.99 though no doubt. Good writing.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|not bad but need to buy new games with points gained from other games. some games are idiotic and not fun
0425241505|5.0|Loved every moment of it.. how he slowly changed his way of thinking for her and how she gently tells him what she needs. This heroine is no pushover. And i love the peanut!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|*Screaming* I absolutely love this book. People have told me to read it for forever and I never thought I was going to like it this much. There was so much glorious drama. Every time you thought man it cant get worse than this, something else would happen.<br />Clary was such an awesome character. I love her sarcasm. Her strength grew by the \\"day\\". She grow so much.<br />Jace. YUMMERZ! Man I love everything about it. He's super hot and bad-ass. Every girl loves a guy who can kick some serious butt. Hes just plain dreamy.<br />I can't wait to read the next book. I'm officially addicted.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Neat little set, our 10 yr old was a little dissapointed in that this is a mini set which meens the whole set will probably fit in a adult hand so its a little more difficult to handle.I asked my son he said anyone interested in Minecraft and Lego will love this set!
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|Wow! This hasn't left my listening rotation since I received it. QT's eclectic taste raditates throughout this superb collection of diverse musical genres. As someone who viewed the movie itself three times,this serves as the perfect compliment to a magnificent celluloid experience. Love the audio outtakes that precede each track,and since they appear in the order that they did in the film,it makes it very simple and pleasurable to recreate the action in your mind. The aural pleasure of QT's jukebox magic makes this soundtrack as vital as the movie itself. Simply superb!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|Nice sounds works fine. Better than buying a machine for sure! N o complaints. A good app in my opinion.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|Love the series and knowing, once it is gone I will still be able to enjoy it whenever I want.  Look forward to purchasing the Complete Season Five when it is available.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|Another hit for the woolly mammoths, this is a great movie for the entire family. Five stars for the fun packed movie with a message for the whole family.
B00AQMSJI2|4.0|I really like this game even tho it takes awhile if you don't wanna spend real money.<br />it takes along time to do anything when you get around level ten. great ga
B004LROUNG|5.0|Excellent, refreshing read, with thrills, excited and something to learn for the novice in the world of litigation. Well done!
B0053O89RY|3.0|I think this show is getting a little stale. The episodes are cute but the writing is just not as clever as it used to be. I know it's very difficult to write comedy and this show started out so hilariously funny that subsequent seasons just haven't been able to live up to the bar the first (and second) season set. It's still worth watching. I hope it has just hit a temporary lull and will bounce back with some great episodes. This is a phenomenal show afterall.
B000SXMSJ0|5.0|I chose this recording as my first Kindle Fire 7 purchase. I love Norah Jones and this purchase just reinforced my feelings. Thank you! I am basically New to the electronic age. Being 70 yrs of age, I am really working at this new age of communication. Having fun, tho.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I would rate it 5 stars but I didn't because u can't even mine redstone but it is still their and yes I am even using a diamond package but no.... nothing.
B005IQ39AY|5.0|Enjoy playing this game. Would like more of this type of game.and would order more of this type of game.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|This is a very good game. Good storyline. Hidden objects are challenging. Had to use hints a few times and even had to replay a couple when I ran out of time. Mini puzzles are good. I played this on a K F  8.9 with no problems at all. Worth the money in my opinion. Hope you get it. I think you'll enjoy it if you like HO games.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|The game in itself is awesome ,along with the great background music it fantastic. Keep up the good work developer.
B00000JBFW|5.0|I have always liked this album since the first time I heard it in 1984. I went to my local record store and there it was sitting on the rack, just released. I thought &#34;Alright, The Classic Purple Line Up Has Reunited&#34;. I bought it, took it home and put it on my turntable, cranked the volume up and thought, &#34;Yes, Deep Purple Is Back&#34;.   Between 1984 and all the way till now, it is an album that has just gotten better with age. This album has many great qualities that SO MUCH rock music from that era is missing. When you listen to it, it doesn't sound 80's, it sounds like Mark 2 Deep Purple In Full Flight !.   It starts out with Knocking At Your Back Door, with the classic Jon Lord intro, then Roger Glover's great bass line, then Ian Paice's solid drum sound, then Ritchie Blackmore's awesome guitar and then Ian Gillan's &#34;Sweet Lucy Was A Dancer...&#34;, A Classic All The Way!.   Under The Gun is a 5 star song with Great Playing From EVERYONE!.   Nobody's Home and Mean Streak are very good songs.   Perfect Strangers starts with that Awesome Jon Lord intro and Ian Gillan's Great Singing and Lyrics, Classic 80's Purple!.   A Gypsy's Kiss with the Really Good Intro, Great Lyrics and Great Playing From Everyone, Another classic track !.   Then we hear Ritchie play some AMAZING lead guitar work on Wasted Sunsets, what a Great Song!.   Hungry Daze is a Cool Way to end the record with the Good Lyrics and Really Good playing from EVERYONE in that song!.  Not Responsible and Son Of Alerik from the CD are Very Good songs as well.  This recording is Deep Purple Mark 2 in Top Form and will always be an Essential Recording To Listen To !
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this book, I do wish it was a bit longer! I love the connection that they have and how they are so comfortable and open with each other. Never a dull moment with these two, if only all relationships could be like this. I would so recommend this book to both men and women in a relationship and even singles.
B007FC3AAI|5.0|I love how the final novel of the Twilight Saga was split into two movies. This first half exceeded my expectations.
0823016714|5.0|This gives a good basis in photo references of facial expressions. the title says it all.<br />It is good that there are models of different races
0307704610|1.0|The worst book ever written by far in the history of fitness.<br />He says that people who are vegans will often miscarry and its not good for pregant women.Just read about benefits of vegan diet and you will know how wrong you are.<br />Also T-Ferris do some research and you will find world's largest vegan population is in INDIA .i don't think have to tell about their actual population.<br /><br />Plus its sickening eating beans all time.Also no fruit ?? You will lose vitamins and important nutrients n develop deficiency.I am sure he doesn't personally use any single schemes shown in book.<br />Though i appreciate his marketing tactics and i think he should write a book on that.4 HOUR MARKETING.<br />Every book of his becomes a sales letter to his new book.<br />The fact that he goes on TED and talks about stuff shows how  deeply advertisements are  in the roots of world and to find truth you cannot even trust yourself.<br /><br />There will be a day approaching soon when all con artists would have fooled the world and there would be no one else to be fooled.
B00B4MUSHI|5.0|cd was finally delivered and the cd case was broken and smashed. Cd works great but the point remains order something new get it in new condition.
B00BEPVAV8|3.0|Its fun but frustrating because it takes too long to get coins. Then things get too expensive. Its obvious they want you to buy (with real money) coins. If you don't buy coins, you spend a lot of time racing for 45 seconds at a time over the same stretch of beach.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|subway surfers ts really fun and free i like the mega boost and jetpacks you can earn people by colecting things
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This season was great can't wait for season 3 would recomend season 1 & 2 if you like this kind of show.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Almost every game created by Game loft is so much fun to play. So when you have a good devolper and a incredible game sirrees you get a fantastic expirence, you get Modern combat 4.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great movie and historical facts that I had forgotten during the Iran captives that were being held.  Of course I'm sure some facts did not take place.  Worth while movie to see.
B000077VOY|5.0|This Gerry Anderson stuff is the bomb. Beats all the computer generation u c nowadays . Thanks tattooed squirrel guy. What's left? Stand by for action, anything can happen in the next half hour. Stingray!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Loved this book, could not put it down once I began reading.  Grisham out did him self on this book.  A must read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is one of the mysterious books that I have ever read, but the series is not done yet for the final finally.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Where do I begin?  I have not read the book but after seeing the movie I must read it.  I loved the story, the simple story telling that is missing from movies these days.  A fantastic story about ordinary human beings that turns into a story of perception.  Which story you chose to believe is up to you, I believe both have value.  3D glasses make it hard to cry but I hit pause a few times to wipe away tears and gather myself together.  You start to care for all the characters because they acted according to their nature.  Visually stunning even without 3D, a movie I will probably watch over and over and I can count on one hand the movies that I think are worth watching again.  Lovely.
B001UTW7QU|4.0|Had missed this series when it came round so I'm slowly catching up on Prime.<br />It's a kind of XFiles meets CSI event, with weird events being tracked to the mysterious Pattern.
B0011UJMK2|5.0|Not one to fly through books, I finished this in less than a week. Tom Rob Smith just become my new favorite author. I can't wait to start the next book in the trilogy.
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|I was in love with \\"Grace for Drowning\\" from the first listening, and I wondered if Steven Wilson would ever do anything else that wonderful, much less top it. Wow, had I underestimated the prog master! \\"The Raven who Refused to Sing\\" is a masterpiece. You'll fall in love from the first listening. Really, set aside some time, play it all the way through, on your best equipment. One of the joys of the album is the terrific job of engineering, so I hope you opt for the CD, Blue Ray, or Vinyl and have good speakers. I just can't imagine any MP3 rip doing it justice -- well, maybe 320K.<br /><br />Wilson has always had an eclectic style. This album is the culmination of that eclecticism. Largely based on classic Jazz, but also progressive rock. You'll hear some Yes / EL&P / King Crimson influence here -- not by any means a bad thing -- but there is so much about this album that is fresh and new, serious and playful, tender and rough.<br /><br />No review can really do this album justice. It is probably the best album of the year, maybe of the past several years.
B008I3RARW|2.0|This isn't the worst, but its pretty unimpressive.<br /><br />it gets steering right, the tilt feels good, but the throttle is flat out broken.  applying the brake results in a near instant stop with little gradual speed decrease.  Ggraphics are average for this day and age, one car, 2 opponents, 1 track. Completely limiting and really equates more to a demo than a full game.
B005GIS1WA|5.0|Loved the video. Cute and funny characters.  For a few weeks my 5 year old watched this movie every chance he could.  He inquired if we could go to Rio for carnival.<br />Great music -downloaded the songs from Itunes.<br />Paid a very low price; arrived in new condition.<br />I can definitely recommend the move for anyone with young children
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Any fan of the Castle tv show would love this book!  I love how connected the tv show is to the books.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It is just what I was looking for. And it is free! Easy to see and play. I win. Yea.
1592407889|5.0|Thank you Sachi for the courage you showed in surviving such a life and for writing your book. I do hope that your mother will see your love for her and that she will not only remember you in her will with the lion's share, but also that you will have some happy days together in the future.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|For a free version of mahjong, this is a total winner!  And every board is not simple so it presents a challenge.
B004RZGUBM|5.0|I love reading this on my Kindle Fire, because the old eyes aren't what they used to be, and I can enlarge the print.  Great times reading the stories in a serial fashion; it is simply wonderful to share these classics with my grandchildren.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I've been using the Anker mouse for two days now. I haven't done a whole lot of serious gaming with it yet, but so far it has performed excellently for everyday purposes. I bought it to replace a 3 button mouse which I had been using for several years. In the past I have used Logitech gaming mouses similar in size/shape to the Anker Gaming Mouse but haven't used anything as sleek or comfortable as this Anker mouse. It looks very nice and is super comfortable to use, even for an hour or two at a time.<br /><br />I am a woman with an average size hand and it's comfortable for me to hold and I can reach all the buttons comfortably as well.<br /><br />I believe long gaming sessions will be no problem with this. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the mouse that I have come across so far, performance wise. It is responsive and accurate and extremely customizable - you better be using this for gaming because it has far too much functionality for every day use! I tend to use the keyboard mostly for games (since I was used to a 3 button mouse) so this mouse has a lot of room for me to adjust my play style if I desire.<br /><br />I will mention that for me, the software didn't install when I initially plugged the mouse in. A quick trip to the Anker website and I was able to download the latest version of the drivers.<br /><br />Although I am inexperienced as I haven't used that many different mice, I would tend to agree with the reviews here that this seems to be an excellent mouse for the price. I'm sure there are fancier ones available but I have nothing bad to say about this one - and it is so easy to use and offers so many options for personal adjustment (like the weight tuning system) that it is a good mouse for someone who may not be really familiar with what exactly they like. I recommend it and hope this company continues to do such great work with the design of their products!
B00ARI9CDQ|5.0|I enjoy the app, mainly because there are multiple options to choose from on the screen, so that I can choose the story I want to read without difficulty.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I am completely addicted to this game. Whenever I have Hetherington do this is the game I go for. I can play this game all day long I'm in love with this game
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I ordered this case on tuesday and ir arrived on friday I have loved it so far and it fits my case fine also the screen protector works fine and It also can go on my iHome just fine and do not have to take of my case at all.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Even knowing the story I was still on my seat thru the whole movie.  A little fun, a little suspense, and a lot of cheering!
B000ASATZ8|5.0|Tremors (the original movie) is AWESOME. It's funny, creepy and action-packed with a little romance to boot. What more can you ask for?
B009VSW15Y|1.0|Will not download to my kindle fire ????? Need help getting it to my kindle please.  Could not find info on how to download.
B004G6TD8Y|1.0|Crazy rock music, not at all classical.  phew,phew, etc., etc., etc., bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla, bla
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This is such an amazing story, impossible to put down.  It was like Ender's game cross a brave New world cross battle star gallactica.  Makes you question humanity, individual rights or societal good?  And what lies are we being told now by those in power in the name of \\"for the greater good\\"?  Would we have the guts and decency to stand up to them if we know the truth?
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Soooo disappointed there is no book 6 or 7!  Sounds like another Auel in the making, waiting years for the next book.<br />Still I will buy the third season video.
B006GWO5NE|4.0|With the discount, this is a decent buy for a USB cable.  I believe that at the original price it was over-priced.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice design and works better than a regular calculator. Well thought out and works flawlessly every time.<br /> Great idea and its free.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|app crashes every time I try to play, this is very frustrating for me. please fix so that I can play again.
1451648537|4.0|Difficult book to get through, yet very interesting story of how an adopted child becomes a billionaire!  Through his brillance, he is able to get through the drugs and anger to share his brilliance with the world and produce the computer on which I am trying to type this review!--and that is only the beginning! Isaacson documents it all very well.
B0059XTUXQ|3.0|For starters, I voted Obama. I'm a Democrat. I think austerity during a recession is stupid. Given how much Republicans adore Margaret Thatcher, I probably would not agree with her on much.<br /><br />I came into the movie not knowing all that much about Margaret Thatcher.<br /><br />The movie is highly disrespectful towards Margaret Thatcher.<br /><br />The reason is because about 1/3 of the movie is spent depicting Ms. Thatcher as a senile old woman losing her bearings.<br /><br />Highly disrespectful. Everyone gets old. Everyone gets senile. Why make the story of Margaret Thatcher about her as a woman talking to ghosts?<br /><br />The same could be done to just about any liberal/leftist hero (the few that live to old age, that is).<br /><br />The rest of the film is fine. It is artfully done in a David Fincher style. You see glimmerings of her career though it's just skin deep. You don't really see any deep discussion on her policies. You are treated to soundbites about individualism and free markets.<br /><br />That part is fine. There is a disconnect between political rhetoric and the real world. Party politics is pretty much about convincing the people in the room that you mean business, more than it is about effects on the society.<br /><br />But the old age part is just unbearable. It overwhelms the movie and is just...disrespectful.
B004JC16LC|5.0|Got this sent to me from Germany to the midwestern US, received it in about a week, faster than two orders I placed with  US company the same day.<br /><br />This is enormous and intelligently presented. I printed off the artist and track listing and it's 21 pages of small print.<br /><br />As an audiophile I was happy to find that the sound quality for these historic performances was at least equal to the commercial ones for the handful that I already own.  Absolutists might need to stick with the high-priced specialty labels but I'm extremely happy with the spot checks I did today.<br /><br />If you've ever searched the dusty cutout bins for vinyl versions of these, you'd do better to just buy this box.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|Does what it says. Downloaded app while in a pinch at work when I didn't have my cell phone at break time.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Great product. Priced right. Light weight and works well with my Kindle Fire HD. I would highly recommend this product.
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Grandson loved it !! and it was very cool and entertaining will always look forward to new updates for this app.
B004XDYJRU|4.0|Latest update is not installing on my Galaxy Note 2. I have plenty of space for upgrade. Developers please check the latest upgrade for newer model smartphones.<br />Great app working fine w/o upgrade.
B00BMVTS1S|3.0|Stunningly beautiful art direction and production design. LOVED the dwarves, Bilbo and all... Good performances from a superb cast. It just seems to me that it falls short in the clearly 'formulaic' treatment of the script - especially the narrative portions - I think they may have rushed things a bit trying to get the product out. It makes me really appreciate the uniqueness of LOTR: Fellowship OTR, which lovingly set the tone for the entire series (wonderfully effectual screenplay). I'll definitely go see the remaining films though...
B005LAIIGC|5.0|Just a fantastic all around film, for kids and kids at heart of all ages.  So much fun, brilliant animation, great story, and it makes you fel like a kid all over again.  Its so rare that I give any film above 3 stars but ROG deserved it.  This is a movie with endless replay value.
B003IDMUT0|4.0|Once again John Grisham has a hit  The Testament was a thriller from the word Go  very descriptive and kept me readin gwell into the night  wit its many twists and turns  and enjoyable read
B00APJLFEG|4.0|VEry enjoyable movie again with great animation.  Maybe not as good as some other recent animated flicks, but good enough to stand on its own merits.  Highly recommended, especially if you have kids.
B00AEFXV3E|5.0|My wife had me order this movie and she really likes it, as it relates to a friend of ours that has had a rough trip through life.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Im loathe to publish this review, but lets face it.  Craig has more than filled the shoes of 007, even if he isnt what were accustomed to seeing as Bond.  The guy has stones, he has style and he can say a ton without really saying much of anything.  And then theres this film overall.  Just brilliant.  The entire reboot of the 007 franchise had me worried, but its been pulled off with aplomb.  And this is the best of them yet.  Yes, it deserves a place among the 5 best Bond films of all time.  Some think its the best of all time.  Theyre not all wrong most likely.
B007BL6XC0|3.0|It's pretty good. I've seen much worse movies. It's average. I bought it because I heard that there is some music in it by The Yardbirds.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is anothe recent animated release that I think deserves 5 stars, a rating I never give.  Its great for kids as well as older folks that remember most of these characters from our childhoods of going to video arcades and standing for hours with pockets of quarters to get the high score.  So many old school games are referenced, and done so in such an accurate and fun way.  Impossible not to enjoy this movie.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|The opening sequence of this movie is one of the most moving things I have ever seen in my life and it is only the beginning.  Please stop and think about that for a moment.<br /><br />It's difficult to describe without spoilers, but I can say this:  The back story - the context for the plot - is a masterwork.  The thought that went into the characters is phenomenal and the entire movie glows with the same polish.<br /><br />Also, if you don't cry and laugh out loud at least once during this movie you may be a robot.
B008I3RARW|2.0|This game is mediocre at best, and feels very thrown together. I was willing to give it a chacne because it was the free app of the day, but at the listed price of $4.99 this would be an absolute ripoff.<br /><br />It simply isn't fun, nor does it feel properly finished.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I am a lifelong fan of Hitchcock and his films, so I was excited to see this movie. It was wicked fun seeing actors playing other actors! I didn't think Hopkins looked the part, I'm afraid. His makeup was overdone, and came across as such, rather than convincing, especially the mouth; Hitchcock had a distinctly saggy little mouth, but it did not look like that! I loved that they kept his big, round belly, though! His acting was beautiful, as always. I thought Scarlett Johanssen did a reasonable job as Janet Leigh; she had excellent 1950's-like mannerisms, but Scarlett is famous for her gigantic, puffy lips, and Janet Leigh has very thin lips, and that threw me off. The story was fun and interesting, but it seemed a bit plot-less. The whole story centers around the creation of \\"Psycho\\", but it's got so many side-plots (the strains on Hitchcock's marriage, etc) that it seems to wander and drag at times, and you're not sure if you're supposed to be focused on the filming of \\"Psycho\\" or the marriage or what. All in all, it was fun, but I probably won't watch it again.<br /><br />Still a lifelong Hitchcock fan!!
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|I can't believe how addictive this game can be. You just can't put it down. And the graphics on my Samsung Galaxy Note 2 just brins out all of this games cool effects. BUY IT!
B00ALYY6ZA|4.0|Short and sweet with some good recipes, look forward to reading an updated version when there is longer data and studies on practitioners.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I used this processor as part of my new workstation build. I paired it up with an inexpensive motherboard, 16GB of memory, and an SSD. This thing flies. I couldn't be happier.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This was a good movie but in my opinion it wasn't as great as I expected it to be after the Oscar hype.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|True to the American struggle of the early 20th century west.  Moving, gripping, honest. A book so raw that it makes one question the sanity of the human condition.
B00AC8ZA3M|5.0|they did a good job of tryinh to tye this into the new game coming out lots of action and adventure
B0013ND30M|5.0|There is a reason why this movie is called a classic. becaus it is. this is one of the best disney animated movies. i just saw the full version for the first time. and i was not disapointed. the art work in this movie is fantastic and the story is great. this is a story that only disney can bring to life and have such a good response. i have said it multiple times disney movies rock. if you have not seen this movie then i recommend you do.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this app is ok because when u tell it to turn or jump. it dosent work. so its not that good of a app.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love it so so much its so fun to play and it cool.if you trust me just buy it
B007IV1E2W|5.0|Very happy with this season and the show in general. Caught up with all the past seasons on Amazon Prime.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|I watched this movie when if first came out on blu-ray without 3D and for some reason I couldn't get into it. Everyone said it was great.  I now own a 3D tv so I bought this and it is a fantastic movie for 3D.  Not the jump out at you 3D.. more the show you the scale of certain areas.. looks fantastic .. LOVE IT
B002GHHHKG|5.0|Meg Ryan has been involved in several movies that touch my heart - \\"City of Angels\\", \\"French Kiss\\" and \\"Joe Vs The Volcano\\". I am grateful to her for allowing me to share moments of deep emotion.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is such a great game it is a challenge. It really makes you really you your mind and also relaxing.
0920668364|5.0|This book was purchased as a shower gift for a first time mother-to-be.  I read this book to my children until they could read on there own.  To this day, my children quote the refrain and refuse to give the book away.  The guest of honor at the baby shower was familiar with this book because it had been read to her as well.  Needless to say, she loved it!!
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|Love Chris Robinson, love the Crowes.<br /><br />  I have seen CRB 8 times, and they tear it up live, Adam MacDougal of the Crowes really comes out in a whole different light on this album.  Neal Casal is straight cosmic with his solo's, both have performed with Phil Lesh and Bob Weir a good bit since joining this band.  I recommend this album to everybody who likes music from the Grateful Dead to Pink Floyd, C-Robs lyrical prowess is on display here too.<br /><br />  They recorded a third album in January of '13 which hopefully comes out this year.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I cannot think of anything I would rather be doing, tonite, than watching this show! I am looking forward to getting Chinese, and kicking back with my boyfriend to watch this. It is really an excitng show, visually beatiful, the acting is down-right superb! The girl who plays the youngest daughter who is \\"not a boy\\" is just an unbelievably fine actress! All ot it is so above fine! I even like all the blood! The horses are beautiful and I hope humaneley treated! The story, the acting! I actually believe that my girl-hero, Caleesi, is the Mother of Dragons! There are lessons to be learned, there is true heroism, there is scary magic. This is as epic as the Wizard of Oz and I probably haven't been as enthralled by a t.v. show since when I was four and wouldn't leave my grandma's house when The Wizard of Oz was on.  I love this show! The actors and actresses are breath-taking and wonderful hero characters. Their acting is just beyond any compare!!!!! Please make more wonderful shows like this and find wonderful books to make shows from! I really love HBO shows, mostly.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Loved it! Anne Hathaway's narration was perfect! I'm definitely going to listen to it again some other time in the near future.
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|First class collection. 2/3's of Pink Floyd are here, but I guess because for legal reasons they couldn't call it Pink Floyd.  Superb performances, excellent recording and engineering and a great selection.  Don't miss this one.  A classic.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|enjoyed the book, some of the sexual situations were expliciate, but the the story was very touching, he was so screwed up, and she loved him. I felt sorry for him.  Book 2 is very good so far....
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I absolutely love this book. I would recommend it for anyone! Read it to just pass the time or anything but you absolutely HAVE to read it!!! You will not want to put it down once you've started it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Was a good read, didn't care for the ending not into the ghost thing....Movie had some differences, but also good
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe haven was an amazing book to read. It was everything I had hoped for plus more!it really keeps you reading through out. And you can't go but fall in love with the characters! I will definitely recommend this book to everyone I know!!!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|This is one of the best books ever. I will definitely read the next book and so on. It was a pleasure to read
6304084145|5.0|I had seen this movie several years ago  and enjoyed it immensely then, too.  Our Book Club watched it<br />this time.  No one had any negative comments whatsoever.  We liked the choice of actors for the<br />roles, the setting (scenes), the costumes, and the musical score.  Sexual content was not, and did<br />not have to be explicit, which should still be held as a standard in today's productions.  Anyone<br />who is interested in history should enjoy and appreciate this movie.  One couple borrowed the VHS<br />and after viewing re-read some of their works of history in regard to the Hapsburgs.  They found the<br />movie to be very true in its portrayal of that family and the era in which they lived
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Ties everything up nicely. Now I want more of Christian Grey's side of the story that was fabulous. I am sure he has some interesting talks with himself. Great characters. Maybe we can see what Katherine and Elliott have going on? I am hooked.
0525478817|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  I gave it to my mom after I read it and she liked it so much she has her book club reading it now.  It's really well written and just a fantastic perspective on the mind of anyone suffering with serious illness, especially a young mind.  It's a love story and then some.  I can't recommend this book enough.  If you're even contemplating it, BUY IT NOW, you won't be disappointed.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Its a great game already but it needs updates to get more things like buckets and lava etc l. UPDATE THIS
1469984202|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who likes this genre.  I was surprised to find out it was self-published as the editing was better than most of the books that I've read from recent years.  Hugh Howey creates characters that you care about and weaves an unusual tale that unfolds slowly over the course of the book.  There's always enough to hold interest.
B005HSGB6W|4.0|As dark and as twisted as the covet itself. Written of its own language or idiolect, and narrated by young Alex is indeed a grim page turner. With horrid tales of the reckless youth, government overture, and the a bit of transcendentalism, A Clockwork Orange is best read in its intended 21 chapters.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I like the addition of the hot and cold lasers, or whatever they are.  Makes you think while you play.  They need to get more levels added.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|This was a pleasant book to read.  Although there were a few places that were a little boring.  I wouldn't call it a book that you can't put down because I did quite often but It's worth reading.
0452273331|5.0|This is the first book by Ayn Rand that I just finished reading. And this book is one of the best books I ever read.<br />They say that she started writing this book in 1933 and she published it in 1943, but if you read it today you can tell that we all must read The Fountainhead these days, today. This book has a very interesting plot, but it also has a core idea about who the human being is and what makes us what we are.
B00B23O96A|1.0|This cd is called &#34;Old Sock&#34; because , like an old sock, IT STINKS!!!!!!! I know: I shouldn't give up the day job, lol. This cd show eric in his mid-seventies laid back, sleepy mode, ONLY WORSE. It reminds me of that ripoff: Jeff Beck and Eric Clapton at Madison Square Guarden, where I paid $200 to watch eric take a nap. He doesn't have to play &#34;guitar god&#34; all the time, but this cd makes you want to take his pulse.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I love how this game is simple enough to not make me crazy, but just complex enough to keep me interested. Great game!
0679805273|5.0|I bought this for a graduation gift and she loved it! Such an inspirational heart felt message. I love this boold Great for young and old.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This game lets you play at your own pace. It give helpful hints when you are stuck, and the story line is fun.
B000056QE5|5.0|My friends laughed at me for buying this but they just can't admit to themselves that this is one of the greatest movies and soundtracks ever produced. You can not prevent yourself from singing along and you can not be sad while listening to this. Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke are icons and I love spending time with them. Of course this CD version is expanded beyond the list of tracks that were on the original vinyl but that's OK. I especially enjoyed the bonus track with the songwriters discussing how these classics came to be. The story about Walt Disney will bring a tear to your eye.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its awesome its so fun to I really sugest you play it buy it right now its even free to sweet isn't it.
B0039TD826|1.0|Oh when open this envelop for probe this great CD, i found other CD!!! i can't believe it. Wao after i wait so long for the arrieved CD to my home, surprise, no is not the CD Exile of Main Street. Please come back my money.<br /><br /> I will buy this CD, i wait that all is good these time.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|It watched this with my son, then he watched it 3 more times. We could not get enough of it. We will probably get it for his birthday, it's easy to watch again and again.
1401235417|2.0|It took me quite a while to get through this.  It just could not get my attention.  Basically, there was an introduction.  there was a maze and a bunch of owl faced/masked people and then I have no idea.  The best part of this book was the art in the back.
0140386335|1.0|I did not enjoy this book.  While I thought he beginning was a good set up for action, the next chapters disappointed me.  I stopped reading after only 3-4 chapters.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|What a great read! Some technical stuff that I didnt fully understand but that only adds to the story. I learnt a lot too. Give this book a go - it is well written and suspenseful, with effectively developed characters. It could also be an entertaining text book on resourcefulness, resilience and innovative thinking.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is the most fun game I have ever played the more levels u pass the more funner the game gets
B008XG1X18|5.0|i love this and have it on my phone,kindle,laptop and my desktop!i pin like crazy and then go back and see what i've pinned this way i never lose anything like a recipe,craft project,design idea,etc
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|This is the way Bat Man was suppose to be portrayed. The Dark Night Rises is gritty, fast paced, and action packed. I love that he is complicated and torn...not a true hero, but kicking vilian tail!
B004QOB8SO|5.0|LOVE IT.  Can't wait until series 3 is out.  You need to try this series that is such a cool twist on the original Holmes.
B005SAP45I|5.0|I expected not to liked it and ended up loving it. Pixar has done it again! This version is sweet, fun, and action packed. My kids love the characters and I loved the animation!
B008I3RARW|2.0|Let's start with the good: graphics. Somewhat detailed and very smooth on 1st Gen Kindle Fire. Tilt controls for steering are surprisingly well done.<br /><br />Where it falls apart is control over your speed, AI, and lack of tracks. Your accelerator controls are very inconvenient forward/backward tilting or other methods that don't seem to so a lot.. The AI drivers are slow and terribly easy to beat. The biggest ding is that it has one track. With al little challenge, one track doesn't cut it.<br /><br />Drifting is kind-of fun.<br /><br />I'm sorry, but I can't recommend this game.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Those out there who need a super hero fix will appritiate this movie. The plot is shallow but the action is great. The CGI is well executed and you will be cheering. This is great family film on a Friday night.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|One can tell that this author is a painter.  Her images are vivid and add life and depth to her plot.
B0060D123K|5.0|Zanny, Funny, and perfect....everything you would expect from the Muppets. This classic tale is turned on it's head for this version. Bring back the joy of the season and rent/buy this. You won't regret it.
B008BU70HW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this inside look at the cast of characters at Downton Abbey-  I would recommend it to everyone who enjoys the Downton series.
B0041OOEJY|3.0|For a kids flick...they remaid this with heavier themes, language, and increased violence that was not needed. It does not follow the plot of the first version...and the acting is awkward.
B00846WWVM|3.0|This is not a bad game but the controls suck. The red button to spray the water is to small and controlling the height and direction of the water is very inaccurate.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Ly whole family loved this film. There was something for everyone...from action to comedy to happy endings, this movie delivered. I highly recomend Brave for your family too.
B001I45UFC|5.0|A deep and touching story that repays it's reading year after year.  Take the lessons learned at 7 or 8 and retell them at 13, 16, and 20.<br /><br />I first learned the story at 27 and then shared it with my future children when they were 6 or 7.  Th e y still remember and I still remember the deep Christian truths for living a life full and deep.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Here a story that will challenge you to rise up and make a difference. This is inspirational story and a story that touches the heart while condeming the complacency in all of us.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Great take on an old classic. Very believable characters in a newer London. Updated tech approach by Sherlock another good angle.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|The visual display is stunning, the story true to form, and the acting was wonderful. This a fresh new way to present a classic story that really touches the soul. Dicken's woul have approved. I would recomend this version who has children or is a kid at heart.
B009WO7NQO|2.0|Crashes on my kindle fire when you try to access level 5 on the first, Tatooine. I also second many reviews here: why charge for more levels? I feel pretty cheated.
B000RUAR5G|4.0|This is Looney Tunes and Sports comming together for laugh out loud action. So good! There are so many cameos of celebs in this...don't blink. Everytime you watch it you will see someone new.
B000002V07|5.0|This album is for the little girl that needed more love in her life and finds solace in her own music endeavor/s within her own talented soul.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|Iron man is here and destined to become a classic. This film has a great plot, lots of action, and villians that are awsome. Robert Downey Jr. is a gem in this and back with a vengence! Loved it.
B000CC1U0U|5.0|Great album all together and recollects some old material and molds with newer material to create a masterpiece of swirling guitars and loud drumming along with some sympathetic lyrics that define this record.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|I good frresh story line with laugh out loud comedy. You will fall in love with those squat and squishy yellow little helpers and this quirky cast. The jokes are funny and the story moves fast. All in all, a great flick.
B0000027RL|5.0|This album is quintessential for all music listeners at the turn of the 1980's into the beginning of the 1990's.  Created out the &#34;Grunge-Period&#34; this marks a turning point for originality's purpose to prevail.
B001P5M7QE|5.0|This goes down as one of my all time favorite movies. As a History Teacher, I both appritiate the take and spin on some very &#34;Dark Ages&#34;. I even show parts of this in my Early World History class every year because it is so good!
B009NT0I06|5.0|This record would be great for target audience of pre-adolescent and above stemming to adulthood.  Sort of sad at points and upbeat as well.  I would recommend this album to anyone who enjoys this artist.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Love the ease with which it works on my various brand devices.  I even use it on my iPhone. I prefer it to Apple apps.  Another product that keeps me shopping Amazon.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|Oh, my.  Where to begin?  I am watching this steaming pile as I write this.  I'm about 45 minutes into it.  I am 39 years old, and grew up on Kung Fu Cinema.  I have enjoyed \\"recent\\" kung fu movies, like Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Iron Monkey, and Kung Fu Hustle.  I ran some errands today, and on the way home, hit up the Redbox.  That is relevant info, from the standpoint that you need to know at the rental cost of $1.59, I feel completely taken.  Holy cow, this is bad.  Why Tarantino put his name on the front of this, I have no idea.  I know he and Eli Roth (co wrote screenplay) are buds, I guess he owed him a favor.  The characters are laughable.  With the clans named after animals, there are may bad puns delivered.  Take out the violence, and this could be an SNL skit.  I have zero idea what Russell Crowe, and Lucy Liu, are doing in this.  Are their careers really so bad, at this point?  As for the writer, and \\"star\\", of this movie, this RZA guy.  I will go as far to say that there are some decent ideas here.  Rival clans fighting for power, betrayal, cool weapon ideas, etc...  The mistake was that he should've had a real writer punch up his ideas, and make it flow better.  Second, and BIGGEST mistake?  Casting himself as the star.  His facial expressions rival only Tim Duncan (sports reference).  His lines are delivered in a mumbled, lackluster, fashion, that make the viewer believe nothing.  He should have taken a page from those who've come before him, like Tarantino, Hitchcock, and just given himself a cameo, or small speaking part.  In closing, I wish I had taken a minute to read the reviews, and spared myself this hot mess.  38 minutes to go, I don't think I'm going to make it.  I should've rented SKYFALL.  *sigh*
1400069289|5.0|This book is very interesting, and fun to read.  It's not too academic and gives good analysis on how the habit can be formed and broken.  I enjoyed this book very much.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|this game is great. gameplay is good. feels like the movie with all the characters giving u task to do in the beginning. I recommend this game deffinatly
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Kate Morton is a splendid story-teller. She moves through vast exchanges of time from historic to contemporary with exquisite detail. Her characters are very compelling.
B00B23O96A|2.0|Hard to find anything good about the CD.  Fan since the Yardbirds but this one just misses all over.  Gone the way of crooner Rod Stewart and that's not good for the fans of a great guitar player.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I'm a history geek that also loves a good juicy novel.  The way Follet so easily weaves the story in real life just makes it that much more sincere, gritty and full of passion. Very addictive!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Enjoyed it from start to finish. Makes you look at our current wold with new perspective. Read it and think.
B009XY97VC|4.0|Since first coming to this genre after listening to their first album and finding many other offerings, I've found TSFH to not be capable of delivering consistently album to album.  Don't get me wrong, it's nice stuff, but there's three or four tracks I just had to whack from the get-go.  Anything with a single voice just loses me.  If I can understand the words (i.e. they're in English) I'm gone too.  I've found that I get more bang for my buck from Epic Action and Adventure.  Their albums have two versions of each track, one with vocals and one without. I find it significantly adds to my long term appreciation of the music.  I skipped TSFH's Halloween album and almost skipped this one too.  It's still better than the vast majority of &#34;popular music&#34; but nowhere near what Invincible was. I also like The Immediate, Globus, Future World Music and some of E.S. Postumus (especially Makara).
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a great game. Very occupying and is pretty brain stimulating. The best part is you get alerts when there is a new version.
B007ZMAL32|4.0|I especially like that they did the album in Swedish.  It sounds like it's got more kick in Swedish, but is rocking in English too.  I've got all of their albums now (except the live one) and this one doesn't seem like it's got the same level of energy as some of the previous albums.  It's growing on me though.  I've really enjoyed the subject matter that the lyrics cover.  There are some great Y--T--- videos that use Sabaton's music and actual footage many times to show the subject matter in action in real life.  Very interesting stuff.  I don't think I've enjoyed a band as much as Sabaton since Iron Maiden.
076115678X|5.0|It helped me understand my hair better. It was helpful with me washing and conditioning my hair. I wish it gave better hairstyles.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This book is awesome for anyone who wants to live an adventure and will blow your mind and take you to the most amazing journey ever.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This writer has quite an imagination.  Very different<br />and a fascinating read.Why do I have to have a<br />certain number of words.  What I wrote covers<br />my opinion.,
B006GECE9Y|3.0|I've used this for a couple years now and love it so much more than the native browser. I needed more space so I got a bigger SD card. After transferring everything over to the new card, Dolphin HD wouldn't show up. So I downloaded it again, but it will not install. And it gives no explanation as to why it won't install.<br /><br />C'mon already.
B002361MLA|2.0|This book was very deep.  I found it difficult to get in to.<br /><br />If you're not well grounded in your faith you will find this book religiously offensive.  Mr. Tolle has some presumptuous interpretations of the Word of God and the life of Jesus Christ.  However, on a basic focus/concentration level it may help you better manage stress.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It is the best platformer ever made in gaming history (version 2)<br />I had a lot of fun playing this game and I bet you will also have a lot of fun
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This story was very interesting! Easy read and never wanted to put it down till the end. Twist and turns that made you stay captured and ready to see how it all unfolded! The title HOPELESS is has a real meaning behind it!
B0002KPIQY|5.0|I'm a fan of this actress in whatever she chooses to do.<br />I wanted to see her in this film from her beginning career.<br />The movie moved along good and was never boring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The graphics are great and it is a lot of fun to do when your on the go. Ok Ok by
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown does it again, this time wiith The Lost Symbol! Chapter after Chapter, I was always in suspense already imagining what was happening at the moment!!!!!!!! This is a must read for anyone looking for suspenseful thrills!!!!!!!!
B009P13RQY|5.0|I've heard a few songs by them on Comcast music choice metal channel. Then, when I saw them on Travel channel's Anthony Bourdain doing live shows in Austin, I was sold. GREAT ALBUM start to finish. They got an old Sabbath sound and seem relentless.
B001MSMULG|3.0|The Godfather - always liked it and glad to have the series for my collection. It arrived just in time for my husband's birthday.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I never tire of Frank Herbert's masterpiece. I've yet to read a science fiction novel that rivals the brilliance of Dune.
B00447L4JG|5.0|I have always loved this movie for as long as I can remember! So good to watch for Halloween and again at Xmas, heck, you could watch it any holiday because of the circle of holiday trees, they do have the easter bunny in here for a second or two...
B007HJHO2O|5.0|We must be in a resurgence of progressive music.  There just seem to be progressive bands popping up all over the place these days.  I just downloaded about 6 new albums to sample and this one is the winner.  I am generally not sold on the first listen through with any complex prog, but this was different.  Jumped ahead to the multi-part song with the album name and was immediately immersed in beautiful, moody, complex, and textured progressive music.  I find that most prog these days is less accessible due to either being overly hard or overly &#34;soft&#34; (trying too hard to reproduce 60's prog).  This seems the perfect mix to me.  It has great energy without being abrasive.  This is definitely music you could listen to while working out and get that &#34;I'm flying&#34; feeling where the music carries you away from the external experience.  Music like this makes me happy.  Music is a subjective experience but if you are a lover of complex, deep, beautifully constructed progressive music you simply must give this a try.
B00004RFFS|5.0|Love this movie so much! Classic. I am not particularly a fan of Tom Cruis but, I absolutely love him in this movie!!! &#60;3
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|is a fun and interesting game. The levels are not too hard yet but I have not played that much.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|The  is the best app ever it  so cool and so addictive you can style your character's Thai  however you want it's the best app ever!!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I started and didn't stop... Many thoughtful moments that illicited a myraid of emotions.  The story is more complex than one imagines.
B00AU15HPC|5.0|If you are a Moody Blues fan-JUST BUY IT!<br />It is the closest we will get to a new Moody Blues CD in the near future. Listen to it a few times for it to 'sink in&#34; how good it is. Truly one of his finest if not his best solo effort...
B007REV4YI|5.0|That's pretty much it. I haven't been through all the special features, but what I've viewed so far I like.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|It is too short to build anything,but it has more animals like a polar bear again real short that's real stupid.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|i just keep listening to every chance i get. love the songs and the way that she sings them. great
B0044C3RB4|5.0|One of my favorite TV series and must own them to watch again later. The actors are excellent. I  picked up some freebies of Fringe at comi con years ago even before I knew about the series and am glad I did. Mixture of sci fi, drama, humor and a great storyline.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|first I bate temple run but I love this app. I like free apps but this app is with a million dollars but still it is free. don't think just get the app
B0034CNSFU|5.0|It's Jimmy. what can I say? Great music, great lyrics ... he left a great legacy. Must have music !
B00B2V66VS|5.0|better than two chains in every possible way. This game is great. If you liked the first game then get this one now. Im cereal super cereal.
B009JBWOU0|4.0|This is an awesome way to catalogue this masterpiece. I am totally satisfied with the set, except for the bogus promise from flixster.com to download the UV copy, blah blah ... it's not a functional process/website and  as far as I'm concerned and it took an inordinate amount of time to just register/sign up/choose password/ and all that malarkey they want ! ... and even then nothing was downloaded despite a 4G system. They should change their name to fraudster.com.<br />Otherwise the set is pristine and the little art booklet is a neat bonus.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|i love it brings back old memiores and some of the music I miss great c d  i really LOVE IT
B001V9TZK0|5.0|The small size and decorative cover make this book very attractive.  We enjoy bringing out every December to display and read.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is the best. I am personally always trying to find a note app thats right for me, now I have. Evernote on the I pad kindle fire and moble phone make it easy to accsess notes anywhere.
0061120073|5.0|\\"You took a walk on a Sunday afternoon and came to a nice neighborhood, very refined.  You saw a small one of these trees through the iron gate leading to someone's yard and you knew that soon that section of Brooklyn would get to be a tenement district. The tree knew. It came there first.  Afterwards, poor foreigners seeped in and the quiet old brownstone houses were hacked up into flats, feather beds were pushed out on the window sills to air and the Tree of Heaven flourished. That was the kind of tree it was. It liked poor people.\\"<br /><br />First published in 1941,[[ASIN:0061120073 A Tree Grows in Brooklyn (P.S.)]] is the story of a young girl, Francie Nolan, coming of age in the early 1900′s in Brooklyn, New York.  There are many themes in this novel: poverty, alcoholism, child abuse, discrimination, but there are two that stood out to me the most.  The first is tenacity and hope.  Throughout Francie's life, their family suffered so many hardships, and yet through their own willingness to persevere, they came through the tough times and things did get better for them.  The second is a message that despite hard times, there is joy.  Near the end of the book Francie's mother is preparing to marry a kindly man who will be able to provide for them in a manner they had yet to experience.  Francie and her brother Neeley were talking about how their baby sister wouldn't have to struggle the way they had to growing up.  And then they say:<br /><br />  \\"And she'll never have the fun we had, either.\\"<br />  \\"Gosh! We did have fun, didn't we, Neeley?\\"<br />  \\"Yeah!\\"<br />  \\"Poor Laurie,\\" said Francie pityingly.<br /><br />A Tree Grows in Brooklyn is simply a beautiful and sad and amazing story that proves to be timeless.  It is a classic that everyone should read.
B001KT6JPA|4.0|Would not want to get on the wrong side of this dude, really liked the part of the assistant pushing the creepy wheelchair guy into the pit of pigs
B00AREIAI8|5.0|super super fun. uses great responsibility skills and the graphics are extremely cool. super super super super super super super super super fun
B005LAIIFS|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. I saw it in the movie theatre and instantly pre-ordered it. I dont have kids but I am a kid at heart and I love animated movies. I would love for my kids to watch this movie oneday. It gives a great spin on the Legendary Figures. (Love the \\"naughty\\" and \\"nice\\" tattoos on santa) Definitely a classic!
0375842209|4.0|This is a book that all should read.  It describes a part of history that we would like to forget, but never should.  These characters really come alive.
B007PBKG5G|5.0|The entire album is amazing! Saw them on VH1 countdown & couldn't believe it was the 1st time hearing them. Have been enjoying every chance I get!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great/quick read!! Different from what I have been reading lately, a must read! Characters felt real, good plot, and believable
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Hooked,  from the get go!!  Easy to download and simple to play.  Has progressive levels that build on its self.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|I love the game of UNO but I think I would like to see more of a tournament or possible a career type game play
B0048WQDIE|4.0|Joseph Heller is a great writer, but his style may not be for everyone, i could almost describe it as dislexic, and the characters are not very likable, but to tell the truth, these are just minor criticisms, this is a great novel, recommended for monty python fans, hitchhikers guide to the galaxy fanboys, on people who want a humorous analysis on war.<br />A great novel.
B00942X8PY|5.0|This is VERY addicting. I like to play it while watching TV at night. I've been playing it for a while and still am not bored with it :)
B000FC1MCS|5.0|This is the best book I have read in a while. It is refreshing, different, and gave me a bit of a different view into autism.
B0030BCCB6|5.0|As already noted if you're looking for the pop Fleetwood with Stevie Nicks and her Billie Goat vibrato, you're in the wrong place.  My wife ruined some artists for me years ago when she pointed out the difference between real and fake vibrato.  Joan Baez is the worst.  Oops sorry for the digression.  This music is phenomenal, very very few guitarists have approached Peter Green IMO.  His singing is great also.  My only complaint is during the second time through I got a tired of the love songs if they could be classified as such.  I can see a few songs about woman but almost every song is a little much for me.  To be fair a lot of artists have this problem.  I think it's an easy subject to write about, oops I'm digressing again.<br />Bottom line if you like rockin blues with great guitar, you have got to give this a listen.  I just wish Peter would have stayed with Fleetwood longer, whether it was  the drugs or not I don't know, but think of what they/he could have done.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|I was a bit skeptical as dwarves are my least favorite type of characters and I've seen enough of golem to last a while but thankfully I enjoyed the movie even with these doubts. Felt the same gamut of emotions similar to the LOTR trilogy.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was incredible. It was refreshing mainly because it was from such a different view. I loved every page.
B009RI4FRU|1.0|I didn't understand the point of this movie at all.  It's as bad as Beasts of the Southern Wild.  Don't waste your time or money on this one.
0425263916|1.0|I was hopeful that this book would have more substance to it after the first book.  The groundwork had been laid but it just didn't happen.  I found myself skipping through many paragraphs looking for something, ANYTHING to happen.  Sylvia Day has the ability - she draws you in - but this left me feeling very disappointed.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Keeping up with the characters was a bit of a challenge.  The small town politics were believable.  I absolutely hated the ending. I read the book while on vacation, stayed up late to finish it and wish I hadn't.. All those slimy characters and that is who gets offed!?  Until the ending I would have rated The Casual Vacancy as 4 stars but once I finished it, I could not.
B00B0ND67K|3.0|If this were blues or folk I'd be all over it, but it's just plain country and I hope fans of country music will give it the recognition it deserves.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its the best game ever. good quality and its just amazingly amazing!!! way better than temple run!! yoj should get this app!!!!!
B00AEBB97S|5.0|The 1950s saw Alfred Hitchcock at the peak of his form:  Rear Window, To Catch A Thief, The Trouble With Harry, Vertigo, and North By Northwest.  Nobody has surpassed the sheer &#34;watch-ability&#34; of these films.  But of these, I keep coming back to watch To Catch A Thief because it holds one's interest without all of the guns, bombs, and explosions of by-the-numbers Bond-type thrillers.  This movie has the grace and elegance of a Russian ballet; it just moves along with the grace of a cat burglar, not in a hurry, but getting there in the end -- and a nice ending too.
B000N4SHOE|4.0|I enjoyed the story line as I didn't know any history about Beatrix Potter.  Cute animations with the characters she created.
B009EEFTMC|3.0|I love this game but recently the clocks were reset and all my previous scores have been replaced by one second on the clock. Does anyone know why it's doing this??
B000SEI230|5.0|Beautifully written and heart warming. I could hardly put it down. I found myself smiling, laughing, and even crying all the way through. This book really touched my heart. I loved it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|dude just get it. it is AWESOME you can go to the netherworld and you make the portals it is just like your free do whatever you want it's just the best!!!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|Because I always have my phone with me I always have a flashlight. And if I'm in bed and I don't want the bright white light (in my opinion the best color gives off the most light) to wake up the kidsI can choose an alternate color. My only problem with this app is its a timed light so if I'm searching for something and I put my phone dpwn and don't remember to touch it in a few minutes it turns off and goes to menu... but I understand why its not an unlimited light because of battery usage. Depending how long I keep the light going depends on how much battery is used. I don't think it uses too much I like it over all keeps me from walking blind in a dark room or parking lot fumbling for keys.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This is a great family movie! My family and I had a great time watching this movie I would recommend this movie to everyone!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|Overall it is a fantastic game filled with great quality and is a amazing sequel to Temple Run. The only problem is for me sometimes it works, others it just crashes and I have to reinstalll it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|why would you give it one star? tell me why it is a great game for playing if you didn't gave it one star and if you gave it one star you are looser
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This game is positively addicting.  I like Majong but I LOVE CUBISTRY!!! The colors are intense and the 3D effects are wonderful. In Majong, you just match blocks, but in this game, you can rotate the cube and actually look into the cube to match designs. I've already shown lots of my friends and they are hooked also :)
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I absolutely love this game it is the boss!!! I love it ! I play it every day! You must get it NOW!!!!
1423140605|5.0|My 12 year old daughter just finished it, with the whole series.  She read the whole series in less than 3 weeks!  She can't wait for the author to get the last (4th book) out, but now she has to wait till October.  If your child loves Percy Jackson series, he or she, will want to follow up with these!
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|WARNING: I've read all the controversy about the depiction of torture in this movie, and the indignant responses from the authorities. I'm not going to judge it on those grounds -- this is strictly artistic.<br /><br />A few years ago, Kathryn Bigelow made a little movie called \\"The Hurt Locker\\" -- a raw, grimy, unromanticized look at bomb-disposal soldiers in wartime Iraq. It made her the first woman to ever win a Best Director Academy Award.<br /><br />So she seems like the perfect choice for a much more epic story: the tale of how Special Ops and the CIA finally hunted down and killed Osama bin Laden. It's filmed and directed in the same hyper-realistic manner as \\"Hurt Locker,\\" but it's clear from the beginning that this is a story with much higher stakes, with repercussions spanning whole countries.<br /><br />As the story opens, a young CIA agent named Maya (Jessica Chastain) is overseeing the interrogation/torture of al Qaeda prisoners in Pakistan. She learns of a man referred to as Abu Ahmed, who is the personal courier to bin Laden -- and with fierce determination, she sets out to locate this man so she can get bin Laden through him. Even when the man is reported dead, she never wavers in her determination.<br /><br />Over the years that follow, Maya survives being shot at, bombed, the loss of her friend and a change in administration that may ruin her career. With the help of her friend Dan (Jason Clarke), she follows the intel to a fortress-like compound in Pakistan, where the CIA soon realizes bin Laden is hiding. As the months roll by, Maya pushes for a night raid on the compound -- and when the raid goes through, the soldiers bring the decade-long hunt to its bloody conclusion.<br /><br />\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" has its fair share of fictional characters (Maya) and scenarios (waterboarding), but to be honest, it doesn't FEEL like a movie. There are no \\"stirring\\" moments, no melodramatics, no rousing speeches, no swell of an orchestra when something important happens. When the final raid on the compound finally happens, it's not a bombastic action sequence, but a slow-moving affair punctuated by blasts of gunfire and the screams of children.<br /><br />Instead, it feels more like you're trailing after the CIA agents and soldiers, through the sun-drenched, dusty Middle-Eastern cities. Most of the story simply follows Maya as she chases clues, rumors and phone numbers, and it takes her YEARS to actually get some decent results.<br /><br />Nothing happens fast. Time rolls by slowly, full of slow progress and frustrating setbacks -- just look at the scenes where a furious Maya scribbles numbers on her boss's window. For most directors, this slow pace and attention to realistic detail would probably end up being boring, but the sudden violent attacks by al Qaeda -- leaving innocent people dead, bloody and screaming -- reminds you WHY the characters have been chasing bin Laden for so long.<br /><br />Unfortunately, some of the dialogue is hokey. Exhibit A: \\"What part convinced you?\\" \\"Her confidence.\\" That is some cheezy blockbuster dialogue, and does not fit in a movie filmed in such a realistic style.<br /><br />But despite that drawback, Bigelow draws quietly intense performances from all the actors, particularly Jessica Chastain. Apparently Maya isn't based on anyone in particular -- she's just a sort of generic CIA woman, but the ethereal-looking Chastain gives her an iron skin and flinty eyes. Her armor doesn't crack until her mission is over.<br /><br />And there are a lot of great performances by the rest of the cast. Clarke gives an unflinching performance as a cold, jaded soldier who regains some of his fire due to Maya's determination, along with Reda Kateb, Harold Perrineau, Kyle Chandler, and especially the underrated Jennifer Ehle as a bright-eyed, equally determined friend of Maya's.<br /><br />\\"Zero Dark Thirty\\" is one of those movies that can almost convince you it's real, despite the chunks of hokey dialogue.The powerfully understated acting and realistic direction carry you along to the end of the quest.The powerfully understated acting and realistic direction carry you along to the end of the quest.
1423140591|5.0|Great book to read after the 1st one in series.  After you read Percy Jackson, by Rick Riordan, follow this.  My daughter loves this even more!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great app. Slow paced for leisurely time wasting. Build up awards and rewards, unlock more levels and activities, nothing unfair or too irritating. Too many ad popups though.
1423113462|5.0|I got this book for my 12 year old daughter, who loved the Percy Jackson series, and she loves this series even more!  If your child loves to read or likes to learn about some history, they should love this book.  She can't wait for the author, Rick Riordan, to do his 4th book for this series :The Heros of Olympus.  Now she has to wait till that though, and that isn't till October 2013.  Once again, great book!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game alot it is fun and wants me to get on my kindle all the time. I love it so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much
B00B7IJBUY|4.0|Being a long time BonJovi fan, I have every one of their albums, and there is not a single one that is bad.  Of course I have favorite albums and songs as everyone does.  What About Now is a mellower album in my opinion, but still filled with great melodies and lyrics that are catchy and memorable. To me, they have proven themselves to be great songwriters, musicians, and entertainers that can change with the times and still put out great music.  They have rocked it out, gone a little country, and played a little in between.  This shows real talent and versatility. Their show in Cleveland last week was phenomenal...3 hours of BonJovi...past and present...Jon sounded terrific, and Richie rocked the house.<br />  What About Now is certainly not like New Jersey, but still a solid album. Classic Bon Jovi inspirational tunes, stand up and fight for yourself tunes, with the songwriting I expect from them. Some may say that some of the songs are too political, but I think the lyrics are what you get out of them as an individual. And really, isn't that what music is supposed to be? Just as art. Standout tunes for me are:<br /><br />Room At The End Of The World: Beautiful melody, a slower song, with lyrics that really spoke to me.<br /><br />I'm With You: also great lyrics, very catchy melody that I have found myself singing at work all day. Jon sounds great in this one.<br /><br />With These Two Hands: Makes me feel like I can do anything. Very upbeat, inspirational tune.<br /><br />What About Now: Another stand up and fight song. Again, love the melody, lyrics.<br /><br />Beautiful World: Love the message in this one, a bit sarcastic, clever lyrics, good melody.<br /><br />Thick as Theives: Again, lyrics spoke to me..about friendship, love, whatever you can relate it to for yourself.<br /><br />Amen: A song about love, and the power of it. Jon's voice is highlighted here and love hearing it!<br /><br />That's What The Water Made Me: This song reminds me of my father, as heloved the water, so it holds a special meaning for me when I listen to it, but it also has a great melody and love Tico's drumming.<br /><br />  So, overall I think this is a great album. Upbeat, great messages, well written, good hooks and melodies. Many tunes spoke to me personally, made me smile, want to dance around, kick some butt and take on the world...just a real \\"feel good\\" album.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I have this on my phone and use it a lot.  I used this on my kindle when I go to conferences to take notes and it's a great app for that.
B005M2A4DE|4.0|The only problem was that in the second chapter it jam a little bit... But the rest of the BluRay its good
B008OOYALE|5.0|my daughter and I love this game! it is very addictive.  we love to wat h all the different dragons evolve!
B00008J2PG|5.0|This is an excellent DVD, starring Gregory Peck and Christopher Plummer.  It is also a true story of a priest working in the Vatican, who hides and transports many Jews and P.O.W.'s in and outside of Rome during WW II.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  It has plenty of suspense and some humor, as well.  An interesting outcome.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This isn't a review of the movie, but a comment on the transfer to 3D BD. Definitely worth the wait!
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I got this for my 5yr old son and he thinks it's great.<br /><br />Ok, I'll come clean:  I've played it a few times too and it's pretty fun!<br /><br />I'd recommend it for kids... Of all ages.
B00884GR0W|1.0|I really wanted to like this because the graphics are nice and similar to Minecraft, but... every time I opened the game, a giant spider would kill me. I couldn't even do one playthrough because I kept dying! :(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really entertaining and enjoyable for kids I love it my friends love it and every one should love it download it
B009AMANBA|5.0|I will admit to having a bit of a historical crush on Abraham Lincoln.  His wit and wisdom was the subject of one of the many books I have read about him.  So, I was anxious to see this film by Spielburg from the moment I heard about it.  Daniel Day Lewis is one of those amazing actors that immerse themselves so totally in a role that you are astounded and see that acting is indeed an art.  He has crafted his well.  Sally Field too, though in very few scenes in the movie totally owned every moment she was on the screen.  Mary's grief having affected her mental health but this also brings about what an articulate woman she was along with her desperation at carving out her place in her husbands life when he had this job that was so all consuming.  James Spader was remarkable and gave quite a hilarious bit of comedy relief. Tommy Lea Jones will mesmerize you every moment he is on the screen.  This is an heartrending and spectacular film.  In my view it should have won the Oscar for best picture of the year.  I rarely go to see movies anymore at all.  But I saw this one twice.  Perfect for your dvd collection.  You will not be disappointed.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|This book was amazing <3, I recommend for all young readers! l (=, can't wait till the next book comes out!
B0068FYZCA|5.0|The BluRay in this set wouldn't boot on my Panasonic BD Player until I removed the SD Card. Never had that happen before. The included DVD boots fine with the SD Card in its slot. Is there a problem with Universal BDs and SD Cards if the BD doesn't need to use the SD card for storage? With the SD Card in, the disc loaded up to the point where the circular Universal logo makes its appearance. It then spun for 6 minutes until I gave up and started looking for a solution, which I found.<br /><br />As far as the BD transfer itself, it's very good. \\"Graffitti\\" must hold the record as the movie with the most night shots ever. Picture clarity has always been a challenge for this film, and I think the BD has made improvements over the DVD, if only slightly. At least one can make out what's going on in all of these night shots. The film is best viewed in the evening hours with light sources kept to a minimum to avoid washing out the picture.<br /><br />The soundtrack is a mixed bag: it starts out a little too loud and creeps into distortion. But as the film progresses, it improves considerably. I have no explanation for why such a thing would happen. It's as if they had the gain set too high at the start of the film, realized their mistake, and made an adjustment, but only from the point where they noticed the mistake. Why not go back to the beginning and fix the sound from the get-go? Strange stuff.<br /><br />Still one of the best trips down memory lane out there.<br /><br />Recommended.
B003TSEEDY|3.0|great book! somewhat not appropriate for kids, but good idea on what teens go through. drags a lot though. but i enjoyed it.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|One word wow. An amazing tale that reminds me of matched. A great book in a  great trilogy.Wow and wow
0446547573|5.0|As a love fiction lover, reading the works of Nicholas Sparks is one of most pleasant fun reads that I'm able to have. His detail writing always has a way of transporting the reader to setting of the actual story. Anyone who is a lover of love stories should read this book some time. I usually like to read the books of movies that come out, so this was the case for this one.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|The final installment of the fever series has to be my favorite. All the questions that have been driving you mad are answered and the twists are great. As promised a happy ending is in store for those who have stuck through to the final book.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Awesome game for my kindle fire hd.  Great quality and control..  definitely worth the FREE download.  I love games like these!
1451696191|5.0|It was the ending-ish that catapulted this to a 5 star book for me because it capped the coming of age tale well. The story telling along the way had been intriguing. There was something to the letter-journal style writing that made the story come alive. Charlie's personal account of his story was so vivid that I felt as if I was a fly in the wall that was able to quietly travel and witness his journey. The characters were a seemingly odd bunch but quite honest and relatable.<br /><br />The read involved very raw language and sensitive social issues that would have a parent thinking twice about having their teenager reading this book so it's a parental call. I would only recommend it to a mature reader.<br /><br />I took a great liking to this book because I'm a sucker for stories about the shy and awkward finding wonderful friends and support system ..and in this case the added bonus of finding a fit and purpose
B008D36INE|1.0|This is one of those rare movies that I wish I had never watched.  The characters were so illogically one dimensional.  Yes, relationships are good fodder for movie subject, but only when they make some degree of sense.  The fractured personalities and relationships in this movie must have been intended to represent the very worst.  If that was the goal, then in that sense, at least, it succeeded.
1401322786|4.0|Mitch Albom is one of my favorite authors. He weaves stories that arouses the curiosity of the mind through intriguing characters that doesn't seem to mess by logic but my story's end, a humanity message is achieved. This book is no exception. Here the main characters Dor, Sarah, and Victor have varying beef with time. Dor wants to reverse time, Sarah wants her time to end, and Victor wants to cheat it. Their individual circumstances then gave the reader pondering moments about the use and misuse of time. More importantly, together they exemplify the anxiety that it can mold in people. Hence, this fable was a creative way of bringing out the weight time has in our lives.<br /><br />I suspect that at one point in our existence, we will have a beef with time as well. Dor's story might just be a reminder that time will move forward whether you love it or hate it, so you might as well take a moment to pause now and think about how you will honor time and use it wisely while you can.<br /><br />My kind of book!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I got this app because I wanted to text on my kindle fire. This is better than texting. You can add people to your convocation, text, and send videos. Get this app it's free, fantastic, and great! I have no complaints.
B008XMXFS6|5.0|This album is excellent and definitely worth the long wait since the last album. A bit different (perhaps more tame) than their second album. A couple more listens and I'll know if I like it more than their first; so far it is close. I agree with a previous post how mayhaps more falsetto might send this album into the outer realms of awesomeness, but I still like it much.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|THIS IS FUN AND CHALLENGING;  GREAT ALTERNATIVE TO BIG FISH GAMES.  G5 IS AN AWESOME OPTION FOR ADVENTURE GAMERS! THEY HAVE REALLY COOL GAMES FOR THE KINDLE. ENJOY!
B0047WJ12K|5.0|This movie has a great plot, and it's filled with action.  It's a good choice for suspense and sci-fi junkies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is one of those that grabs you and won't let you put it down. So many unexpected twists in this story....Colleen Hoover may be one of my new favorite authors. Would read this book again - and I'm not one to read books multiple times!!
B003VANOFY|3.0|the head set broke after mild use but sound quality is awesome, duct taped em up and still using them.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app does exactly what it's supposed to do.  . . . . . . . . . . . . . .  I like it.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I love this game ever since my brother got it on his tablet! now I got my own tablet I'm getting on mine I finally got it! So she like interactive games get this game!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I was the unlucky recipient of an adapter that just plain didn't work - plenty of blue screens and other problems with unresponsive USB ports when using it.  So, I ordered this adapter and haven't looked back.  I would not hesitate to order another (so I don't keep leaving mine at work when I need it at home), nor would I recommend any other adapter made by another company.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|It was a good read but would have liked more action. This Reacher was more in thought than action. Some unrealistic moments.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is part of my routine. Every morning I have chores to do related to your horses. I don't want my horses sad or unhealthy. Great games for building responsability in children. I have only two small compaints, another variety of breeds and I wish I could see my horses together. Even so the game is near perfect!
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|I hate how its on sale but whatever better than mc3 and easy to play. I find it fun its better than nova 3.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|If you like flow, and auditorium and games like that, then you will love this.  Anyone who rates this less than 5 simply doesn't appreciate this type of game and even if it spit out gold coins they wouldn't be pleased.  The music is great, and constantly changes. The graphics are elegant and pleasing to watch, vivid and smooth as butter. The concept is interesting and addictive.  Get it and don't look back.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|You will be surprised at how much you'll enjoy this story!  The actors are all superb and very well-known.  The story is very touching and at the same time humorous.  I think it would appeal the most to people of retirement age.  It's a must see.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Best game ever just like temple run oz and others love it so much but every time it changes I have to upgrade it but I don't care
B0096BIENY|5.0|I really enjoyed Il Divo's Greastest Hits, as I have all their other CD's.  The song selections are some of their best renditions and there's something for everyone.  They bring magic to the music they perform.

145162607X|4.0|I have read everything that I know Philipppa Gregory has written.  I liked this book although, for the first time, I thought I found some historical inaccuracies in her story.  I recieved this book soon after I ordered it and it was in good condition.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|very fun and exciting.  I love the game because it has horses and you can buy gear for your horse. You can buy new
B003Q97D48|4.0|Keeps me on the edge of my chair, and in suspence all week. I hope the show keeps vewing.<br />why can&#34;t they view the repeats after season ends?

B007V4530A|5.0|I love Ted talks.  This book is right up there with the Ted Talk presentations.  It is an easy read and provides examples from previous presentations.  The tips and tricks in the book are easy to follow and allows the reader to incorporate their own presentation style.  Love it!
B0052AC8C6|5.0|A great movie with a good story. The animation was awesome to watch and all of Rangos face expressions.  Fun for the kids.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|I bought this for my teen age daughter, and she loves it! I know it impresses her friends. They all want one now!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I hadn't heard of these books, but saw them at the top of the Kindle best seller list and took a chance on them.  In short, they are incredible.  It is really one long book, but apparently written in volumes.  As soon as you finish Wool, you will want to read the Shift prequel (there are 3 volumes, but same concept that they are really one book.)  I believe that I saw on the author's website that there is a sequel coming called Dust.  I'm not a huge sci-fi fan, but these books cross the line into mainstream.  I enjoy them the same way that I enjoyed watching Lost (even though they have nothing to do with Lost.)  Do yourself a favor, just because this book is not (yet) on NY Times Bestseller list, buy it and read it right now!<br /><br />*EDIT 3/17/2013* Minor tweaks to wording and explanations since first review was written in less than 2 minutes.
B0051DSAP8|5.0|I haven't written a review in a really long time but feel compelled to throw in my two cents about this album.<br /><br />I'm a fan of all genres of non-commercial metal. I like black metal, speed to thrash, death metal and some power metal.<br /><br />I've gotta say this is some pretty dark power metal and that's the way I like it.<br />Total fantasy, lyric wise. The songs themselves are fantasy conjuring.<br /><br />If you're a big fan of vocals, in particular, this vocalist will impress you. He has an operatic sound similar, to say...maybe, Vortex. Similar in tone. Sometimes he's an evil minister or sometimes an innocent in a church choir.<br /><br />The songs are short and catchy. I'd say very tight song writing.<br /><br />This music, to me, can be best described as a robust glass of wine, reflecting candlelight from some decaying altar, covered in cobwebs and blood covered bibles.<br /><br />Cheers!
B00622BF40|4.0|Australian movie and the words are sometimes a bit difficult to understand.  But the script is so corny and the outcome so heart-warming.  I've watched it a number of times.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I liked it very much I will read the rest of the trilogy. I would tell my friends about it
B004KPQK2S|5.0|Absolutely wonderful movie.  A very heart-warming story.  I didn't recognize John Malkovich at first because he is always the consummate evil character but here playing a quirky, likeable role.  An inspiring story.
B000XXGMQA|5.0|Very good service, in time and always very patient and comprehensive :) it was a great experience :)! Thats it...
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I was skeptical when I downloaded this book.  The first couple of chapters seemed crazy.  It was recommended on Instapundit several times, and I needed something that would work.  So I persevered to the end of the book, and Taubes made a convincing argument.  This works!  Followup with doctor a few months later confirmed improved cholesterol levels, but I could see the results on the scale immediately!  I strayed off the ranch for a while, put on a few pounds, but now I'm back to safely heading toward my target weight.  And I feel better too.

0375703764|3.0|I wanted to like this book, I really did and on some level at least I did like it enough to finish it, but it just seemed to take such effort to get anywhere in it that my enjoyment of it was almost nonexistant.<br /><br />For those not familiar with the format of this book the story is of a man who is piecing together the notes of another man of an in depth analysis of a series of films made by another man involving the mysterious happenings in the house that he lives in. Couple all of these layers with multiple footnotes (some of which go on for pages at a time) and references most of which contain additional footnotes or references to references and many which start off talking about whatever they are noting and then drifting off into something else entirely and add to that multiple type fonts, pages where the text is upside down, page after page of notes located in a box in the middle of the text, mirror writing and codes and what you get, in my opinion, is an almost indecipherable mess. Only my morbid need to know how things would all wrap up kept me going many times throughout the long arduous process of my reading.<br /><br />This is not to say that the book is poorly written. All of the interwoven stories are very well imagined and all of the characters are nicely detailed. The author's prose style flows nicely and the imagery presented is richly detailed. It just seemed gimmicky to me and I didn't particularly enjoy all of the oddities that seemed to just be there for oddities sake.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|great game.  I play as soon as I wake up..before my son try's to take it from me.great way to teach shapes

B007SGM084|4.0|This is by far one of he best books I have read in a very long time! It has everything. Love, romance, sex, mystery, suspense. Reading this trilogy I have felt every emotion. I was angry with Christian and devastated with Ana. This was a beautiful story about two people who fall in love. The growth and healing Christian goes through because of the love between him and Ana was amazing. This trilogy was very hard to put done. EL James has woven a very engrossing story!<br /><br />I did find Ana annoying at times. She would go out of her way to intentionally case drama. The constant thinking and rethinking decisions was very irritating. I would find myself rolling my eyes at on occasion.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|I bought this book after following this man`s life on the news, especially after those tragic recent events. I wanted to know more about him. I saw him on Fox n friends after he punched Jesse (a few years ago). He cracked me up, talking about them not been able to catch him, being trained to escape n evade! I hope his family sees proceeds from the sell of his book. My heart really went out to them before, even more so now. People can donate to his family through [...] (craft international), I am so sorry for their loss.<br /><br />Now the book review! VERY honest approach. Multidimensional story. You come to care for the people involved, this is a true account of real people's acts and courage. I was surprised that it contained accounts from his wife. That added a whole other thing to consider. The book doesn't seem to glorify war in my opinion it gives insight into the mind of the best American sniper to date. But you also get a feel for the suffering he had to go through in training, in warand at home. Personal relationships that were so pushed to their limits. His wife must be an awesome, strong, courageous woman! That to me added to the honesty. I appreciate his service, the service of others mentioned here, and all service by all members of the armed service. I have also gained appreciation for the other unsung hero's of war - Soldiers wives!!<br /><br />I have family that served in other wars, my dad, my uncle and my grandfather. I guess it really brought this aspect home to me, not only do I respect the service they offered, but I have gained more respect for my mother, aunt, and grandmother.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a very fast paced game, fun and addictive. You better have total concentration when playing because it can get away from you quick if you get distracted. There is a lot to keep track of, so be on your toes. You will love it if you love to play bingo.
0316069884|5.0|This book is one that everyone should read.  It is intelligently written with compassion and also fact based.  Definitely would recommend.
B00785P2QC|4.0|not a bad Sim game. instructions could be clearer, but it's worth what I paid for it. unfortunately, since I installed it today, another game on my kindle fire keeps crashing, so I probably won't keep this one for long. Also, it doesn't always autosave on exit, so I've had to complete several goals multiple times. That needs to be fixed,  or a manual save option added.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed this book immensely. It really was a joy to read. I look forward to more books by this author.
B003NHRGSQ|4.0|From Serenna Hatfield: I don't normally like romance books, but this story held my attention. Looking forward to reading the last book in this series. Keep up the good work. Young adults will like the story and everyone dreams of living a different life at times. This let my imagination run wild. Thank you.
030759565X|5.0|This cookbook was perfect!  The stories and pictures described each recipe so completely, you could almost taste the food!  I would recommend this book to everyone.  This book would be a great addition to anyone's cookbook library.
0393338398|5.0|Michael Lewis is an incredible offer. Anyone that is into sports and sports statistics will love this book. I do wish he would tone down the language. I need Michael Lewis to write a basketball book like this one!
B00AFEXRME|4.0|I liked the story line.  It is a reality in today's world that some people are &#34;functioning alcoholics&#34; and put others at risk<br />emotionally and physically.  This character faced his problems and told the truth in the FAA Hearing. Good lesson for us all.
B008I3RARW|2.0|Yes I tend to play games sometimes sitting on a couch or laying in bed. Unfortunately this game requires you to physically tilt the phone forward in landscape mode in order to accelerate. Try playing it laying in bed. Also the introductory video at the beginning is akward and jarring when it changes your screen orientation from landscape to portrait and back. Weird. Overall its ok, however I do feel like this is an amateur production. Good thing I didn't pay any money for it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Having a blast it's cool I'm able to connect to Facebook not like the jerrastic park game I want to be able to connect with my phone

B007IXWKUK|3.0|For all the hype it was a bit of a let down.  Female character not easy to identify with.  Male character stereo typical for romantic lead a not only beautiful but in possession of unlimited wealth and connections.<br />Life in the perfect world gets boring fast.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is great for learning and having fun this is great for learning about taking care of your own horse
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I am a criminal defense attorney and usually find crime novels hard to read. But this one gets the feel of criminal law right. Even rarer, it does so while discussing an interesting theme--and yet does not sacrifice character for either plot or theme. Most rare of all, Mr. Landray manages to accomplish all of these things while providing unusually memorable and accurate commentary on human relationships in the suburbs,
B004SBS8LA|5.0|My children and I have loads of fun with this game!  We love the birds and all the funny settings.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I recently got this app and fell in love with it. My little sister also likes it and the early levels are just right for her. I am very satisfied with this app!
0670026603|5.0|I was concerned this would be a romance novel (ick!), and I'm glad it wasn't. There eere no easy answers in this book, and the story was not predictable.<br /><br />The story involves two people with limitations---one due to a SCI (spinal cord injury) that leaves him paralyzed from the neck down.  The other is limited by a bad experience that has left her limited to a circumscribed life in a small town.  They meet when she becomes his caregiver.  Each person realizes the limitations the other is living with and tries to expand the other's horizons.  The result is a unique love story, which examines the extent of love, and when it isn't enough.<br /><br />This was a book that made me think, and made me wonder what I would do.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|There are so many twists and turns in this book that they leave you quite confused as to &#34;whodunit&#34;.  An enjoyable read from the author. Looking forward to the next few in the series
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Don't want to bore anybody with repetition of what others have said. Best movie of 2012: Skyfall. Best actor: Daniel Craig. Best actress: Naomie Harris, shared with Judi Dench, of course. Best supporting actor: Javier Bardem. Best Director: Sam Mendes. And Albert Finney, in a class of his own. Well, you get the picture... no pun intended, oh well, take the pun. Seen it four times so far and I intend to purchase the DVD to see it a few times more. Casino Royale was certainly the best Bond movie up to that point. This is even better. Enough said. Back to watching it!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This show is so well-written that I often forget that I'm watching actors play roles. I feel like a fly on a wall watching people's lives. The only thing that concerns me is that no one seems to have aged in the seven years that have passed since the first season 1912-1919.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|Excellent story. I enjoyed how James included characters from other Austen novels.  Very exciting- lots of tension and suspense. Well done!
B000VDUWMC|4.0|I liked the author's perspective on how some countries have been more successful in developing technology while other societies have remained seemingly primitive. Instead of focusing on differences in race and intellect, Diamond chose to focus on the actual geographical and resource differences on continents. I also liked that he didn't try to place blame on any culture or society for having been born in a particular area at a particular time.
B00B23O96A|1.0|I had to put a star for the review, it doesn't deserve any level of a rating!<br />This is the worst album I've heard in years! Eric channeling Hoagy Carmichael.<br />Save your money and buy a Filiger album or the new Ben Harper/Charlie Musslewhite one.<br />Eric should take our money and retire.<br />I can't give this one away.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is rewarding and a well thought out app for all ages and lots of fun.  This app is fun just relax the rewards are not instantaneous.
B009ZQGNPQ|1.0|Amazon has exclusive streaming rights from episode 3 on .I became A Prime member so I could stream the episodes. Unfortunately Downtown Abbey is not included in the\\"thousads of free streaming movies\\" they advertise. Very deceiving if you ask me. I the silly consumer thought that meant free streaming. WRONG! I guess Amazon does not work like Netflix meaning you can stream all that is offered. Great for making them money but not so great for the consumer . Then again who cares about us?
B008SAZHLQ|5.0|Every once in a while, I read a book that wrecks me, that makes the world seem pale and gray. This is a book like that. I don't know which to praise first, the authors acute observatory instinct or the vitality of her language, the smart pacing or the colorful imagery. This is a marvelous book.
0802473156|5.0|This book was very helpful and when I used the techniques it improved my relationship. This book was shipped quickly and was in great condition.

B006GECE9Y|5.0|I was looking for a way to install Adobe flashplayer or a similar player on my Kindle Fire HD  and ran across an Amazon forum at the following link:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/forum/kindle?cdForum=Fx1D7SY3BVSESG&cdThread=Tx3KJWOUGOOXCD7<br /><br />Look down the list of posts on the thread and you will find a step by step procedure for installing Dolphin browser and Adobe flashplayer.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|Cute game. Like most games you have to use real money to get very far though. And that is what I think.
0440238609|5.0|I loved these books and found that so much of the story line concerning the dark materials can really be based in truth.Couldn't put these books down.
B0087IT8LO|5.0|Don't let the fact that it is a foreign film dissuade you from watching it.  This movie is good for the soul.  Very entertaining, lots of laughs, yet heart wrenching at times.  Definitely a must see.
B0037XPP7U|5.0|This movie plus the sequel are well done.Very enjoyable and believable. Highly recommend this movie.Cate is very believable as both the young and the more experienced Elizabeth.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|Munro's writing is good, but maybe a little dark for my taste. I did like the biography of her life at the end. That was my favorite part of the book.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I loved this movie,even my hubby enjoyed it and was impressed. The acting was good,the plot enjoyable and believable. I def.recommend watching this movie you won't be disappointed.

B007OWRBJK|4.0|What e memory the an has! It is fascinating and Pete sees to be a very intellgent through not always empathetic person. He is brutalt honest about his own flaws though.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Great motion picture and well acted. A little touch of History is always an interesting subject. Kept everyone spellbound thru most scenes.
B0090X4GJE|5.0|Love her voice...so many wonderful songs that don't get airplay. If you like the song Anything Could happen then you will love the rest of the songs on this CD.
B007REV4YI|5.0|As expected this movie is great and full of excitement as all BOND movies exhibit and Craig is exceptional too.
B005ZO6NRA|3.0|Not great but worth a watch. Still think Arnold's Conan was the better movie. blah blah blah blah blah blah
B00AA0TZTW|5.0|This CD was as expected and then some.  It is wonderful to hear his music again and I hope there are many more undiscovered tunes to come.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|The most poignant and honest book I've ever read. Refreshingly direct. A must read,especially for those who work with adolescents.
B009AMANH4|5.0|This actor never disappoints me.  His works in this movie only further solidify his BEST ACTOR status.  This role was made for him.
B001QB9ETK|5.0|Great acting, great story. Great symbolic story of both redemption and political realities. Loved the pacing, nice stretches without dialogue letting the scene speak for itself interspersed with wonderfully insightful words. Killer words at the end are particularly heartbreaking.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Wow!<br />Amazing book! It inspires me to take off my shoes and run for all eternity.<br />This is one of those books that changes your life for the better... forever.
B0091REZMW|5.0|this game is really fun to play. you can even play with your friends I really like it. I am very glad I found it. it is a really great app I cant believe it was free.
B008I3RARW|5.0|Not bad looking, or playing. It just happens to be a great time-killer while waiting for the rain to stop in Aussie GP qualifying.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|I'm a big fan of John Carpenter's work and really enjoyed this movie when I was growing up. So, for the price point, added features, I couldn't pass it up. It's a fun horror movie which takes me back to my teen years. So, if you like 80's and 90's horror and don't mind some cheesy (by today's standards) special effects, this is a movie for you.
B00B2270P8|4.0|It was very entertaining. Brought about some closure to the saga and moved quickly.<br />I would recommend this if you liked the earlier films.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|The characters were so well written. Even the hated ones. There was always something happening and I couldn't wait to read more. Loved that it was told by the point of view of 2 different characters.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It is fine.<br />.. I lost my old one..needed a new one..was at a friends and he had this type, which worked well, so I got the same type
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Not much of a story just kinky cruel sex. Gross subject matter. Evil subject and no story plot just sex.
B00AQKEPMI|5.0|The 3D effects were great.  Not overboard, just part of the story, like it should be.  It has great depth and not a lot of pop outs, so not corny.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not exactly the ending I expected ,however very well written story. It was definitely a thought provoking series.  I would definitely recommend it
B002M9WW30|5.0|Spent a day enjoying these again.  And I will watch them again and again.  Thanks Sly for the great series.
B0006GAOCW|5.0|I haven't seen a lot of Katie Holmes' movies but the ones I have, I enjoy her performances.  This movie doesn't end the way you'd expect but I liked it.  Good chemistry between Katie and Marc Blucas.  Would purchase from this vendor again.
B001AQT0RC|5.0|I sit on the end of my seat each time I watch this movie.  Now in Blu-ray format, its even clearer and more intense.  Awesome movie.  I wanna be next....lol...
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|i liked the story. Colleen makes the reader dive into the story plot and feel for the characters. i enjoyed the fact it wasn't just a flat romantic story but rather something engaging where characters faced real issues that would leave anyone wondering whether or not they could have survived<br />.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|Thanks for giving us an ending, but many more seasons is what we all still want~~~~!!!!~~~~~<br />Please make more for us.
0767821629|4.0|It was a rental copy and he cover art was trimmed. You also never mentioned any stickers. But, other then that it was good and shipped really fast.
0061733199|5.0|This book is a gold mine of useful information.  If I could only have one book in an emergency, this would be it!
B008RA3X5E|2.0|The instructions do NOT Work---can not find the item on AMAZON...<br /><br />Looks good but want the correct time on it so I can set the alarm..
B007IK44CK|4.0|Loved the movie.  I had a few small difficulties with it streaming.  But seemed to clear up the longer I watched the movie.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|This is one of the best games I have played. I like the storyline and it made me jump at some points. I couldn't put it down.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Best Bond movie ever!! A don't miss!  Daniel Craig is wonderful in this newest Bond movie.  Can't wait to watch it again!
B007JWKLMO|4.0|I will watch anything about The Beatles or its individual members-- even if I've already seen it 50 times, even if it contains much of what most fans already know (which this movie kind of does.) So I did enjoy it. But a word of advice for anyone who buys it: keep the remote nearby, as you will likely need to frequently adjust the volume. The music clips are LOUD at times. But some people may not mind this, and I may just be nitpicking. Just something to note. Still, an enjoyable film. I found it particularly touching when he spoke about John's death, when the interviewer said to him &#34;but he was no angel...&#34; and George said &#34;he wasn't... but he was, as well.&#34;
B00A1U2SVS|5.0|I would recommend this album to anyone who likes Led Zeppelin or just rock music in general. This album just shows how great of a band led Zeppelin really is. I mean what other band besides led Zeppelin can still sound this awesome when they've been performing for so long?<br /><br />Every song on this album has all of the awesome Jimmy Paige guitar solos and everything else you have come to know and love about one of musics greatest artists ever.
0805079831|5.0|This book is excellent and a must read for anyone who wants to learn the real truth about how our government operates, the way corporations have taken over, and how badly we, the people, are left with no recourse.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I loved this book and Jodi Picoult has now become my new favorite author . Since reading &#34;The Pact&#34; I have read 3 more of her books and plan to read more. This is an excellent book and you really connect with the characters and feel llke you know them. I would diffinately reccommend this book, but know it is not light reading
B0074MZSWW|2.0|The 1st song on the CD, &#34;Hold On&#34; is very distorted at the end. How do I return/receive the old and the new??
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|My teen age sons enjoy this game, but I think I enjoy it even more. Addicting to play and see how many coins you can shove off.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Great love story. Kept me interested longer than a typical novel. Poppy is a realistic character that makes you want to know more.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have enjoyed every episode of Downton Abbey and find it hard to wait for the next chance I get to watch it. Great character development and very clean cut.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game you have so many different varieties of games but you have to buy them with the money you earn from the games you play which makes it even more challenging!!!
B003TSEEDY|1.0|As a school counselor, I thought I would enjoy a story about high school bullying. However, this book was overly graphic in its description of the actions of the high schoolers. I am so glad I didn't put it on my 8th grade son's Kindle first.

Having been an executive legal secretary myself, I can relate to everything they do.  Great show.  Have told my friends about it.<br /><br />D.Jackson<br />Houston, TX
B00B2DSIAI|5.0|We loved this movie; my two year old thought it was great (and even loved dancing to the credits at the end) and as a fan of 30 Rock and Glee both, I was delighted to see &#34;Kenneth the Page&#34; and &#34;Sue Sylvester&#34; interacting in this movie.  Very fun for the whole family.  Oh, unless someone doesn't like candy.  We have a relative who gets nauseous at the sight of it and he did NOT like this movie -- but only because of the presence of candy.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Its a fun time waster and the price was right. works good on my kindle fire. need four more words
B000H30B2C|4.0|I have no problem with the added length (although I'm not crazy about having to buy this movie twice in order to get the \\"full\\" length of the movie).  I also have no problem with it being heavily laden with CGI effects (you do what you have to in order to make the movie you want the public to watch and buy).  I accept the story departures because I liked a lot of the revisions that Jackson made (however much we want things to be written in stone and tamper proof, people will muck about with the things we love).<br />The problems I do have with this film have more to do with the overall creepiness of the relationship between Kong and Ann Darrow (Naomi Watts).  The idiotic casting choice of Jack Black as Carl Denham (he immediately turns Denham into a nasty slug, entirely too vile and despicable to enjoy on any level).  And the Ichabod Crane look-alike Adrien Brody as Ann Darrow's second choice love interest.  Getting past them took some doing, managed only because the story kept things aloft and alive.<br />I will always hate the final line of both films because it's so obvious that \\"beauty\\" had nothing to do with killing the beast.  The blame falls squarely on the little weasel quick to cast the guilt elsewhere.<br />I did love the sumptuous look and feel for the time period depicted, the fabulous adventure on Skull Island (I could have enjoyed more of this and less of the love interest between Kong and Darrow), and the lovely score by James Newton Howard.<br />I choose to regard this as less a remake of the classic original and more of an addition to the continuing saga of Kong.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|A very moving, powerful account of extremely brave men who have my utmost admiration, respect, and gratitude.  A must read!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Incredibly inspiring! Totally believable. So many points in this book brought me to tears. It just reminds me that &#34;all is well&#34; and that I am loved.

0316187216|5.0|If you haven't read his First Law trilogy, you should start there. It's a masterpiece. This is just a really good book, probably the weakest Joe has written so far, but still worthy of 5 stars. Or maybe I'm letting that sweet, sweet ending sway my judgement too much.
B000N2HCM4|3.0|the first part of the book was entreating, the second part &#34;so so&#34; and the last part I did no read it
B001FOR5XU|3.0|I found a copy of I Am Legend on a great sale when I stopped into a library on my last business trip. I picked it up mostly because of the great price, but I also knew that I had liked the Will Smith movie version of I Am Legend. I'd heard whispers that the book was very different from the movie, but several people mentioned they liked it nonetheless.<br /><br />Very different is the best way to describe the divergence between the book and the movie. Robert Neville is still the last man on earth, and he still faces all the fear and depression such a circumstance creates. Beyond that, much is different. In the written world of Richard Matheson, the apocalypse took on a very different form, and Neville's enemy is a different sort of walking dead.<br /><br />This is more a short story than a novel, finishing up at 170 pages. My copy of the book goes on for another 140 pages, but the rest is a collection of one-chapter short stories, each of which is much darker and more macabre than the main story. A few of the later stories left me with chills, and I had to close the book and find a new story before I could fall asleep. Stephen King wrote that books like this one were an inspiration to him, and each of Matheson's stories shows his prowess as a horror author.<br /><br />While I have no real interest in horror stories, I can see Matheson's strength in that genre. His particular power is in his ability to suggest terror without over-describing it. Matheson's stories, by and large, allow the reader to paint their own fear into the story, as he includes just enough detail to hint at the horrors without over-describing them. Most of the terror comes from Matheson's description of the emotions within his characters, rather than detailing the sources and reasons for the fear.<br /><br />I give this book three stars out of five due primarily to the content, which is largely unfair to the author, and I admit as much. I write as someone with no love for horror, so I can't give this title the rating another reviewer might. Readers who are very sensitive to stories of evil will not find this a welcoming title, but I cannot deny Matheson's strength as a horror author.his title the rating another reviewer might.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is my favorite series in many years. I love that it takes real history and builds the story around it.
B00866JL96|5.0|There are many stories to come out of the Afghan war, and some of those are stories of love. Some may call this a &#34;chick flick,&#34; but it is a story for men, too.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|The show has very little to do with the story of Sherlock Holmes but that doesn't detract from how good Elementary is. Holmws and watson work well together. This is a great show.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Based on true events, this story is well told. If you like romances, you will find this &#34;chick flick&#34; to be to your liking—even if you are an elderly man like me.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Just need more classes and races. I think rangers who spec in arching should get a companion to tank well I level up. It's also confusing trying to update. I still have not been able update anyone know how.
B00AYJCEYC|4.0|I havnt listened to it yet but know I will really enjoy it as I love anything michael bolton sings
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|This is an awesome book. The language is a little hard to understand at first, but it is full of adventure.
B000002LAC|5.0|i chose this rating because this is a fabulous music reminds me of many songs i have heard in the past
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this because I have some connections because my friend tried to get a date for our dance and instead my other friend stole her date but she still went.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|I am loving this series. It is well written and the pace is perfect. There are some misspellings, but they are minor. And his \\"pet\\" makes me smile thinking about it. Read this series, you won't be disappointed.
0345531930|5.0|I would recommend it to anyone. I am so happy that I bought it. It is a great gift as well.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|The story is good and the animation is awesome! Worth watching  by children as well as adults! Bound to be a classic!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Food<br />Dec c c v c.  VCard f d f f c cc th chef dc he curb f2f f fact fed get turf diff
B004QX07G4|4.0|Truly like opening a book to see Ellen standing before you and giving a one woman stand-up routine just for you!  Who can not love someone who makes you smile.....and laugh out loud!
B00555X8OA|4.0|I learned a bit from this book. It's well written and seems squarely targeted at the lay person and not the professional. Recommended to anyone who want's to learn about how the brain works.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Really fun absolutely amazing<br />Extremely entertaining only issue is energy points other than that it is addicting i have been playing it all day!
B001ANYDAO|4.0|I loved how this book started out and identified what &#34;Outliers&#34; are and what made them that way, for instance, Bill Gates is an outlier because of the circumstances that existed that made it possible for him to succeed.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the last chapters of the book kind of ran on and it is possible to poke holes in the author's interesting premises.  All in all, I enjoyed it and recommend it to those who are wanting to help their children succeed.
B005CRQ4OW|5.0|Turns into a single entry was posted in by u by uh hui and the other hand to get to know about you are looking at least two weeks after all these people were arrested on a regular contributor the other day that I was in a regular season of a while now I am looking forward and I have been in the most common type and a single most common form and I was a while back in a single person in by
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this social network for keeping us in touch with our far-flung relatives and friends.  Many of my husband's schoolchildren, now adults, send interesting reports of what they are doing.  Also like to find out tips and see pictures.  Saves a lot of letterwriting.<br /><br />Games, Hate to say I am a big fan of the games on fb.  Spend way too much time here, but was in a w/c for six months and this was great to keep everyone posted.
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Tedious fun. The first time I played the demo, I was hooked. Much to my surprise, they kept the rest of the game new and interesting on the full version. Not repetitive at all! Free on amazon for that one day too.
B00633W614|5.0|Though I haven't read it, my son-in-law and son have read this and they also read the other book of this series and are eagerly awaiting the pre-order I did for them for the third book in the series.<br /><br />I love it when my purchases are enjoyed so much by others on my Kindle account.  Did you know you could have many, many people with their itouches, ipads, kindles, etc on your account?  (as long as you trust them!!).  Only five copies of a book may be on different devices  at a time, but we have the grandchildren, and children all reading and we can share and talk about the different books.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Lee Child is one of the few authors  I just can't get enough of. Every time I pick up a new Jach Reacher novel, I wonder if this is the one where I start losing interest  well, this is 't the one. I loved every page. It was nice to get the background on why Reacher left the army. A good read.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I love Adobe Reader because it is free and accurate and a fast way to download your files.  What would we do without Adobe Reader?  I recommend it for all users of computers and devices.
1849163863|5.0|The setting for this novel, the Isle of Lewis off the coast of Scotland is truly unique and, in a way, a character in this well-written book.  Some of the flash backs of the lead character to his childhood may seem to slow the pace of the mystery development, but actually are key to the plot.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It's a good app I play minecraft for xbox also but it needs more stuff like in pc version or xbox360 version I also play survivalist and that's good because you can fly better and the only monster is a werewolf
B008FPOIT6|5.0|I don't consider myself a reader/lover of science fiction at all, yet I loved every word of this book! The combination of musty old books in a centuries-old tradition mixed in with high-tech machinations is a true delight. I have already recommended Mr. Penumbra to dozens of people.
B003F9G8B8|4.0|This is a great story and it was well told.  It is inspiring and hopefully will encourage greatness in those who watch it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game.  I play a lot of games, mostly Sudoku and Bejeweled.  Still learning the game, love the surf board and rockets.
B005721W9O|4.0|This is a fun movie and one that I keeping coming back to watch! enough said (even though more words needed)
0525953728|3.0|Killing Bin Laden was an act of great heroics and the author deserves great credit. The story is worth telling.  Unfortunately I could not involve myself in this book.  The author told his experience but lacked an analysis of the event.  In my reviews I follow the practice of not saying more when I did not like the book so I will stop now.
B005LAII3A|5.0|Better than the original (and I don't often say that): fast paced movie.  I watched it almost every night for the first week after I received it: I kept finding more details and it NEVER got old!
0385341008|4.0|Interesting, quick read.  Humorous and poignant look at German occupation of the Chanel Islands during WWII.<br />Humanized the events and gave me insight into the history of them as well.<br />Wish the writer had written earlier in life and had more stories to tell!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this before I went to see the movie.  Don't get me wrong, the movie was great too -- but this book is awesome.
B00BFUC8RC|4.0|Great game to pass the time. I'm totally amateur and i haven't had to pay anything to enjoy it and I'm totally digging it. the theme and animal sounds are amusing. good match. feels like a carnival game.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I bought this for my daughter and she loves it.  She was so excited to get both the DVD and Digital copies.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Goes above and beyond most weather prediction apps.  Only thing lacking is hourly breakdown.  Pretty accurate, never crashes, activity advice.  I use it nearly everyday.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this game draws you in. lots of interesting twists. bummer comes when you get all excited to get into that next area and boom....free part is over...pay to play :(
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|It's a good game. It's fun, you float a ball around and absorb other balls. I like it. I'd probably have paid for it but I lucked out and it was the free app of the day.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Absolutely exciting thrilling amazing book. This is a must read will keep you on the edge of your seat and wanting more the whole time!!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|Gone Girl presents one of the weirdest love relationships that I have ever read about!  Forget Christian and Ana from Fifty Shades of Grey: their relationship is way kinder than the one between Amy and Nick.  Both characters appear doomed by their unhealthy childchoods and uncertainity about the REAL self.  After the fact, when both characters decide to write a tell-all, as Amy sees Nick hunched over his laptop, she talks about his pounding of the keys.  Strange, huh, since computers produce zero noise from the &#34;clacking of the keys.&#34;
B008220C38|1.0|This is not Anna Karenina. More like a mess. It's really awful. I read the reviews before purchasing about it switching from stage setting to movie setting and thought it sounded odd but this is so foul. I loved every other version of Anna Karenina I ever saw but this is like the nutcracker ballet threw up on a Broadway comedy. I'm so very disappointed. This movie really STINKS !!!!
B0074MZSWW|5.0|This is one of the best new CDs I've heard in recent years.  So many influences-  Al Green here, Janis Joplin there, a little Amy Winehouse, some Jack White-like guitar...  I've listened to it daily in my car since I got it and every time I pick up on something new.  They have their own unique style, and the song-writing is exceptional.  Just saw them on Austin City Limits (also SNL & Brittany on the Grammys)- dynamite performers, and a tight ensemble.  Can't wait for new material from this band!
B0070Y46UY|2.0|It wasn't too bad once you got into it, was surprised at the ending. It did drag a bit for several chapters at the beginning.
B00992CF6W|5.0|can anyone tell me if they have minecarts? that's my favorite part and I would like to know before I buy this app
B007C7UZIG|5.0|Gaben delivers with Steam for mobile devices. It runs smooth, allows you to do awesome things like install games remotely and even lets you chat to your Steam buddies.
B000V9D5LG|5.0|just as i imagined it- light weight too- fit like a glove- focus & distance is right on-will get the the longer one later
B000XUBFE2|5.0|There is no question to the fact that this is the best book ever!!!!! I loved it so so much!!!!!!
B003PTP4S6|5.0|The music is just beautiful, awe inspiring!  Makes it a must buy! The combinations of two musical geniuses is just perfect.
B0040HO01Y|3.0|Nice story but felt it was for a young audience. Although, I'd probably watch it again, if I do not have anything more interesting to watch.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|I just love Tommy Lee Jones in this movie!  At first it looked like Tommy Lee Jones was gonna be a washed up old man but he proved he could keep up with the fist swinging younger actors.  The plot was a good one too and so realistic!
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|This app is cool  .I like it . The only bad thing is  it is really hard to move . I can't stand that part . You guys should buy minecraft  P.E. It is awesome . But in survival their are zombies ,skeletons ,creepers,spiders. It is your opinion.
B008Y73940|5.0|Loved it!  This movie had me captivated all the way through.  McConaughey played this role well from the ball busting lawyer to a soft loving father!
0062238868|5.0|Chris wrote this book so one would feel like he was actually there listening to him. The language and eiscriptions are realistic.
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Loved this series! It got better and better! Definitely recommend it! Very Sad it's the end though. Could not put it down.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Martin does an amazing job painting vivid pictures it only makes sense that this translates into an awesome tv show as well.
B006225RN0|3.0|The movie was alright, but the streaming video was lagging and poor quality. Adrian Paul still a hottie, though. :)
B002DJSBMA|5.0|I have watched it many time when I suggested it to my different loved ones!!!  I wld still keep watching it.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|The movie doesn't work. It stops and we have to skip three or four chapters in order to continue seeing it.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I just finished listening to David Bowie's latest release, The Next Day. Wow! Overall, this album smokes! This is vintage Bowie with tracks that sound like they could have been on The Man Who Sold The World, Aladdin Sane, Heroes or Lodger, Let's Dance, or his later, more industrial-sounding rock albums from the Nineties and beyond. In short, The Next Day is a cohesive whole by itself in 2013 as well as a career-spanning overview of the rock chameleon's discography. I bought the deluxe version with the three bonus tracks. They fit in with the rest of the album, but I wouldn't say they are essential. It's too bad that Bowie has said that he won't tour for this album. Maybe there will be an HBO special? Or maybe late night talk show appearances or even Saturday Night Live? One thing is for sure: It's nice to say that this is Bowie's best album since Scary Monsters and actually mean it!  ADDITIONAL NOTES: This is very definitely a progression of his later stuff but is the first consistently great album, I think, in about 30 years. The sound is more muscular while the lyrics show a man comfortable in his own skin with the wisdom that only a lifetime of experience can provide. While Bowie might be a rock chameleon, the great thing about The Next Day is that it finally shows us Bowie as Bowie. It's brilliant!  One more ironic thing: The lyrics on the inside sleeve require a magnifying glass to read them! Is this Bowie's way of saying to us Baby Boomers that we should take a closer look at his lyrics?
B000GCFG7E|4.0|You got to love Child's action packed version of good detective work. Throw in Reacher's uncanny ability to track time, see details and massive strength and you have a unique adventure. Thanks to the thrills, twists and developed characters you are drawn into Reacher's world. Great way to spend a lazy Saturday morning. Thanks Jack. And thank you Lee. Well done!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I've played it a lot. I'm impressed with Groban's songwriting ability as well as his musical talent.This is now one of my faves<br />!
B0025KW29U|4.0|Clever, funny, and well written.  I'm not much if a fan of the musical genre but Dr Horrible is fantastic!
030726999X|5.0|I wanted to read more--So glad Larsson was able to finish the series before his death. Looking forward to the fianl book in the series.
B008I3RARW|3.0|To check this game out for yourself please check out my video review which is posted in the comments link for this review on amazons website.
030745455X|5.0|A good finale to the series. I read all three books within a week. The froeighn film was excellent also--not so sure about the US version.
B00846WWVM|1.0|Congradulations to Amazon for offering yet another in what is apparently a very long list of Pathetically Stupid, Mind Numbingly Boring, and Grotesquely Horrible FAOTDs.  I couldn't delete this app fast enough.
0307454541|5.0|One of the more different books that I've read lately. the locale was exotic to me and it was an interesting look at another culture. It's a loss to the literary world that Larsson is gone.
B005Y423ZC|4.0|Great live look and listen to a great artist...sound is good, and the video captures the live event well....well done.
B00338QENI|3.0|I some what enjoyed the book and it was very informative however I feel the author gave us more information then we needed.  It seemed like she was trying to make history into a novel.
0425252868|4.0|I knew of this story before but this book gave such incredible insight of what it was like, on both sides, to fly combat over Germany durong WWII.  We will never see the likes of these people or times again...
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Wow this book was awesome. Once again Nicholas Sparks does not disappoint. Like most love stories parts are very predictable, but wow the end seriously caught me by surprise. Great book, a must read for sure!!!
B004S3MB2U|5.0|Everything I was looking for and more. Easy to use. Accurate and fast. All products should preform as well. Price was reasonable for what it can do.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is amazing soo fun. Great for girls and boys. Really enjoying it. Great graphics. To sum up a brilliant game.
B005UBNKWO|4.0|this is the 1st in line in the 6 core family , it is very easy to overclock if you wish to do it .
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had a little difficulty getting into this book.  The early pages turned me off by describing every person, place or thing with so many adjectives and adverbs that it took a paragraph to get the bit of information applying to the story.  When I got past the beginning, it was a good read.  Fascinating and suspenseful to the end.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Ok this game  so cool . That I had to leave my clan in codbo2  hear is my gamer tag GarishJuggler 98 so send me a friend request
B00138J342|4.0|I own Ten and Vitiology and never heard this album until I listened to the provided samples.  I would describe this album as a blend between the two albums that I own.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This is the best game ever I think,So far I am on level 50!!!!!! :)<br />Awesome my brother ha s this game to
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|For a free game. Wow.  Really enjoy the hidden object games. This one is really good one.  Hard enough to work the brain but yet fun
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Hola muy buen libro gracias me sirvió de mucho ojala a todos los parezca igual que a mi vuestro libro. Felicidades
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is good and fun for every one. It's fun and maybe a little scary but not like drop the phone Kindle or IPad scary it's more like a woo I didn't see that creeper. All I real would like to see is a setting where u can have mods ( I'm talking about the Xbox too).
B006JPS1OM|1.0|T5his game would be good if I wouldn't have had to pay for it and then it not let me go on to chapter7 vital records it just kicks me out fix this glitch and I'll give 5 stars
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|I in joy the game but it's not really that scary. Yes it mite fitting at firs but it just gits old after a while.just add lots more color and better animation and a better sense when u die because it's to normal for a game to end like this.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|It was really fun to read and relax to enjoy another Diary Of A Wimpy Kid book.<br />  THANKS JEFF KINNEY
B005KCGIUY|5.0|i bought this album at the puscifer concert a while back and had it on in my car one time when my mom borrowed it (my car). she loved the album, and she usually isn't big on the type of music i listen too (a bit to heavy for her liking i would assume). though we do share similar taste. i got this album for her for christmas and she was really into it. and it goes without saying puscifer is just awesome. and so is this album.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is one of the rare games that even though there are in game purchases you can still be really good at the game. It is free and has a really cool multi-player world. you can make allies with other people, and attack people. The campagins get harder as you defeat more eneimes.<br />The situation is that the KRA has attcked and you are an American General and you have advisors helping you decide what to do. You build a base, get allies, and use campaign to attack the KRA.<br />A few Tips:<br />Keep gold stars they are very good to use for special bulidings.<br />Use the special weaopns building, it is a way to collect gold stars.<br />Quickly expand your base and build alot of mess halls they cost gold and are the best gold purchased item, i have worked out the math.<br />Enjoy the game it is very fun, if you like SimCity or Civilization games you will love this.<br />It's free and never ends, only one in game ad, and that's when you just go in so get it
B000Q66HBE|5.0|Bullet is the first band in a long time,  to make me want to go &#34;old school&#34; & buy their CDs instead of just buying Mp3 singles. Beautiful guitar solos, thundering drums & bass & passionate lyrics. Matt can scream with the best of them, & still have a very emotive singing voice. It just doesn't get any better than this, Bullet just blows away the bland pop & rock songs my local radio stations play. I hope The Poison is the beginning of a very long adventure for these Welsh rockers.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|It is different from any other book Nicholas Sparks has wrote. It has suspense and romance and danger put together in a way that's perfect. I highly recommend this book to anyone.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Big fan of Rick Riordan. His way of working Mythology in present time and add a great story line  This book was fantastic, and I can't wait to read his next book. Keep them coming Mr. Riordan
B00BMVTS1S|1.0|Another series of movies that should be on T.V.! Please make one movie and that be the whole movie. I will not watch another movie that false advertizes...Soon I am going to start wanting a discount on these lame movies. I will not watch the rest of this Trilogy Quandary. Or any further productions from this company or group of writers or whatever they think they are. This style movie has drained the U.S economy for the last time. I thought the two towers was awful! And this movie was the same thing as the first of the Lord Of The Rings movie. Another long stupid trail. With way too much unbelievable nonsense. They actually spoke as if they might have been on this journey ....in 2013.!.!. Almost identical. When it opened I said to my self o mg. Then it took half way through the movie to get juicy Lord Of Rings Action. Wow....and that goofy *my precious guy*  was in it.....for way to much of it. This movie is a slam dunk waste of time!<br />The only thing and the only thing that made me watch throughout....was the gentlemen from the ( Hitchhikers Guide To The Galaxy!) Dude Don't panic...You are a great actor.
B00AB6LHJQ|1.0|I have downloaded hundreds of books to my Kindle and I-pad.  This is the first book I have ever deleted.  I could not get past the first chapter.  Hated it !!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved Hunger Games and Catching Fire, so had to buy Mockingjay.  It is so unreal that it is quite entertaining.
B008J2GAKU|5.0|Just read it you won't regret it. Can't wait to get the next one. It says I need seven more words.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|There's a nice selection of sounds to choose from.  My daughter requests that I turn this on before we go to sleep. Great app!
1452113432|4.0|An excellent and visual cookbook, with a lot of &#34;Gallic charm.&#34; I've enjoyed watching the series, so this was a nice follow-up.  Her recipes are appetizing and demonstrate Rachel's spin on some traditional French classics as well as her own unique style. Beautiful illustrations added that special touch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I loved this game. It is so addicting that i cant put it down. Evey time i go on my Kindle  i find myself playing Subway Surfers
B0000SVW8G|3.0|The movie was great. The DVD did not work in regular DVD player. An error message kept on appearing saying that it was unreadable. I was able to see it on MacBook but had few damages.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|fun playing. it is absolutely fantastic to play.<br />I am having so much fun playing this game. it seems so realistic. good job.
B0038OY6DW|5.0|I can hardly believe the difference between movies that I saw when I was a kid  and those of today.  The two Robert Downey/ Sherlock Holmes films exemplify that difference, or the differences.  It was not only that I was highly entertained, but the ingenuity, professionalism, and creativity that illustrate those differences are obvious in these films.<br />I hope that there will be other Holmes/Downey pictures:  I will be among the first to purchase them.
B000NY12LO|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. The way that Picoult's characters and their stories interacted was amazing. I read this for a freshman an English class and finished it within 5 days of getting the book. Loved it.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I love this game! It's so fun and addicting. Well worth the money to unlock everything. I really want to see more expansion packs! Make one of the expansion packs an extraterrestrial virus that comes from a meteor or something.<br /><br />How to make it more realistic: reproduction/ increasing population. Also have a natural death thing. 4 people are born every second, two people die every second. Use that. With this, there should also be an ability or trait that attacks the reproduction system.<br /><br />Hint: if you have the neurax worm, get everyone infected then buy symptoms to the left till you get to the one that makes people worship the world. Once did that and won the game with only about 5 million people dead.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|You have done it again<br />robert with Ironman 1 2 and 3 i love your work and hope you can make another. My kids and i keep watching this action-packed movie. Some scenes might be intense for some of your kids. But over all, it is a great movie for the family. If your family likes movies about superheros.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|It would be nice to see movie about Mark Watney. Or even series.<br />Its first book I read in original(I'm Ukrainian)
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|I was so happy to get this app then it asked type in my User name and password. I didn't have a account so I made one and it always had a problem. so disappointed.
B008Y73940|4.0|Matthew McConaughey pulls this one well above its level.  The story's only so-so and the plot twists are formulaic, but the supporting cast is solid and Mr. McConaughey's performance makes it all worth while. And that's without even baring his pecs. Bravo.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Very informative than that of the other social media. I  enjoy meeting the people and talking to them learning their different outlook.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Mildly interesting & very easy to read.  A noble idea, but not enough of a wake-up call. It was not that inspiring in my mind.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|I needed the challenge to relax on my break. So Temple run is it. Temple run 2 was okay so I must move on to more challenges.
1932100660|5.0|Full of information that astounds us about nutrition.  Very readable and easy to understand by the layperson.  Worth spending the time reading.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|My granddaughter likes it so much she said ooh. She thinks the pony are so cute and enjoys playing with figures.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am in love with this game and I have only been playing it for ten minutes! It is awesome!!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Was better than expected...I really like it as the kindle fire is a lot heavier than the keyboard. It is nice to be able to put it down and just read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because u can get so much better at the game even on your frist try.My dad loves this game because u can go faster and faster and get so many coins and get people with your coins and boards with your coins and much much more.Download this app if u have not.Bye.
B002L3ARRU|5.0|I wish we had more movies like this nowadays. This is so light and great, with a great message that we should stop and smell the roses once in a while because life will pass you by. I recommend to everyone, I don't see anyone not liking this movie.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|From the very first paragraph Ms. McKenna's style of writing captured my interest. She has an easy way and interesting descriptive patter to her writing.  Far in the story I wondered why James was Misremembered and enjoyed the u folding of events.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|I've only been playing for a few minutes but I can honestly say it is very well made and really fun to play. Two thumbs up.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|movie are so amazed and real good movie, I would love to watch that movie again, I highly recommend you watch that movie
B00992CF6W|5.0|So I have this on my cell phone (iphone 4s) its not the full version...but is this? please help me before I spend 6.99 on the game when I have the (apple) pocket edition on my phone.<br />@
B00AA7O22U|5.0|way lots of actions and really thriller. i highly recommended any one watch that movie, you wont missed that show!
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|I enjoyed the simple earnesty of a guy writing about his love of the 80's, through an old programmer's eyes. All the references reminded me of everything I loved about my own youth.
B004H4XI5O|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The secrets of the mind and how images are vital to memory was fascinating. Not only did the author delve into memory but he gave real life examples and interviews with people. Highly recommend.
B003Z49LYO|5.0|Loved this mini series. Wish it had been longer. Give this a 5. Hated the ending but was perfect for this movie. Like to see more to come.
B008476HBM|1.0|The storyline is boring.  The characters are not well developed.  Subjecting high school students to this will make them hate reading.
B00270WH3Y|5.0|I've always found it fascinating when I hear \\"younger\\" people tell me about great musicians and great singers, then proceed to tell me of who's out there now.  It's not long before (and long after hearing a few tunes) that you're longing for *real* musicianship.<br /><br />The kind of musicianship where feelings are expressed with the right words and music-- that equally, ethereal quality --is displayed with an artisan's craftsmanship.<br /><br />There are very, very few contemporary musicians-- either as writers or instrumentalists-- that can hold a candle to the singers, songwriters and musicians that we grew up with in the 70's.<br /><br />***<br /><br />When you hear (and enjoy hearing) songs like:<br /><br />* The Boxer<br />* The Song of Silence<br />* Feelin' Groovy<br />* Mrs. Robinson<br />* and, most certainly, Bridge Over Troubled Waters<br /><br />There's definitely something missing when the music doesn't connect with something deep inside of you.<br /><br />This greatest hits is a great survey but not a comprehensive overview.<br /><br />***<br /><br />Still, it's a reminder of what great music is.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|This had all the information I needed!!! Thanks for the detailed info!! Keep the updates coming!! Look forward to more words!

B006FE83UE|5.0|I have always loved this movie, ever since it came out on TV when I was a child.  Gregory Peck is one of my favorite actors.
B008M721MS|4.0|It's a great app to connect with your friends and family......but on my kindle fire hd 7 inch....there is one thing that bothers me......it's that if you send a picture message it doesn't always go through...but I've never ever had to deal with a huge glitch I recommend you get this app
B0050KEVO6|5.0|This app is my favorite on the kindle it is very fun for creative people like my self buy this app youll be glad ya did!
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Great story of someone overcoming addiction. It's so much more than a movie about a plane crash, that was just his catalyst for change.  Excellent performance by Denzel...well done!
B009O2XY12|4.0|not my fav game in the world my dad said even at free it was over priced but, its a time waster
B008O9V4C2|4.0|I bought this the same time as Morph the Cat and the final Steely Dan album.  I've always been a huge fan; however, Morph the Cat was very underwhelming, compared to his best stuff.  This, on the other hand, is right up there - every tune is catchy and smooth.  Almost as good as Kamakiriad.  Good stuff!
B00846WWVM|5.0|I love this game it entertains me for hours! it is great for in the car, at home or in bed!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Accurate and easy to use. I like the lifestyle feature of this program. It tells you forecasts for your favorite outdoor activities. I would recommended this app to everyone!
B00AECGQF2|1.0|my daughter paid for this and has yet to download after two days. Not able to cancel or anything ugh.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Really enjoy this game.graphics are great and you really have to use your head. Keeps you amused and is a great way to pass some time.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Just like the rest these are great books!  The book kept me engaged and on the edge of my seat!
B005J2V74C|4.0|I really liked the way this movie was done. It made fun of ghost hunting shows and at the same time it was a little scary. Unlike the Paranormal and Blair Witch films it used the cameras in a more intelligent manner. They showed you some of the terrors but at the same time there were enough things that go bump in the night to tingle the imagination. My only real criticism is that it was too long, as though they tacked all of the possible endings on instead of choosing a good stopping point.<br /><br />If you like this film, may I suggest that you watch \\"The Feed\\" 2010, Steve Gibson, director. It takes place in a haunted movie theater and involves a film crew feeding live footage to a TV show.

0525422943|5.0|In her first book, If I Stay, Gayle Forman told the story of Mia, a young woman left in a coma by the same car accident that killed her mother, father, and little brother. She tells the story as she watches over her unconscious body and the friends and family who plead with her to stay. We know she chose to stay, but I always wondered where she went. Now we know...<br /><br />When Mia came back, one of the only reason she returned was for her boyfriend and best friend, Adam. Now, three years later, Adam has become an angry, unhappy man. His band is famous, he is dating a famous actress, and he has the world at his fingertips, but he can't have the one thing he really wants: Mia. After she woke up, Adam stayed with her on the long, painful road to recovery. Her determination to play the cello again was one of the driving forces that kept her going. When she left for Julliard the following fall, Adam headed to the LA with his band. Although they were a continent apart, Adam was determined to stay together. what he didn't understand at first was that Mia needed to move on, from both the accident and everything that reminded her of the accident, including Adam.<br /><br />After three years apart, Adam is in New York with his band, ready to continue their European tour. On a whim, he decides to stay in New York one more night, and he finds himself drawn to the concert hall where Mia is playing. After her concert is finished, she sends someone to bring him backstage. It is that choice, that instant, that changes their lives forever. The survivor's guilt, the shame, the grief, the loss, all come flooding back to both of them as they spend an awkward night together. Mia convinces Adam to take a farewell tour of NYC with her that one last night before she leaves for Japan on her own tour. He agrees, but he seems to do so in the same punishment-seeking way he is about his entire life- believing he doesn't deserve anything better. Along the journey, Mia and Adam share their deepest pains and find in one another the people they once knew as well as the people they have become.<br /><br />This is a beautiful story full of grief and heartache. Told from Adam's perspective, you can understand how he grieves as much as Mia, although his grief was never realized since they technically weren't his family (although in all aspects but biology they were indeed his family). The reader can also see the grief pattern Mia has experienced where she is simply tired of being treated like the victim. For three years she experienced everyone, from her grandparents to her professors, treating her like she was fragile and would break at any moment. She hated it. She was tired of everyone giving her a free pass because of her family. She just wanted to be seen for who she was: a girl, a cellist, a person who didn't lose everything and at the same time, a person who did lose everything. Together, Mia and Adam heal one another, and it is a story you need to experience to understand.<br /><br />I not only suggest this story for anyone who read the first book, but I also recommend both books as a great story for struggling readers. The story starts with a traumatizing event and continues in a full story arc through the culmination of the sequel. It is a well-envisioned and beautiful story that will undoubtedly touch anyone who graces its pages. Gayle Forman is a great author, and I am grateful she decided to continue this story.epest pains and find in one another the people they once knew as well as the people they have become.<br /><br />This is a beautiful story full of grief and heartache.

B000WZAE1I|3.0|good not great. I wouldn't buy it on DVD but not Blu-ray. Well worth it if you are a fan of Neil Gaiman
B004MC0FO8|5.0|I like this product very much, able to find out a song when I am not sure of the song or thy singer. I have donloaded so many songs because of this product. I have told all my friends about Shazam.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This seemingly simple game is totally addictive, with the next screen coming up as soon as you master the one you've been working on.  It's a great feeling to get all of the blocks covered with the colored pipelines and have the 100% come up.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|For me it was the most beautiful movie of 2012 , and I am not talking just about the beautiful picture but the spirituality , and the 14 people that rated 1 star have no soul , so sad ...  well watch it and see for yourself .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Honestly it is amazing but I don't really like the world tour thing. I always have to update it very time it switches to another place. But other wise another successful app!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is a great download for my smart phone - since I always have that with me, then I always have a flaslight.

B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Any time Frank Miller is associated with a project it is going to be DARK and The Dark Knight Returns Parts 1 and 2 are no exception. I read the graphic novel these DVD's are based on in the Mid 90's but unlike many of my friends I had no real desire to see it brought to the screen. I had two reasons for this. The first was Hollywood almost never gets the transition from Book to Motion Picture catastrophically WRONG! The second was personal I just did not enjoy the experience of a Post Justice League World.  It was depressing and I get enough actual political stupidity in my life on a daily basis I don't need it in my escapism. Besides the Idea of CADMIS winning in the end just rubbed me the wrong way. I WAS WRONG in every possible way. As Good as Andrea Romano has been in the past as a Voice director she continues to out do herself with every new project. Casting Peter Weller as Bruce Wayne/Batman and Michael Emerson as The Joker was inspired and their performances were even better than Bruce Greenwood and John DiMaggio's in Batman-Under The Red Hood which I considered to be the best BATMAN film to this point.If you enjoyed the Christopher Nolan Batman Trilogy The &#34;Dark Knight Returns Part 1 and 2&#34; is a must buy
B00A8ECU24|4.0|great content for a free game...even for a (ahem) 32 year old. brings back great memories. but does everything have to be SO expensive?
B005GG0MIS|5.0|This book was a great behind the scenes lesson in U.S. political history.  It provides an instructive background when watching today's antics by Republicans and Democrats alike.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Get past the first episode and the changes. Plenty of time is given to develop the characters as well as the storyline.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|This is much more than a &#34;movie&#34;, it is truly a work of art - Terence Malik is just amazing; his vision is expansive and out of the box.  Many people don't like this film and some, like my husband, did not like it the first time because he hadn't understood it.  I took him home, read him the reviews, took him back a second time the same day, and he loved it.  We saw it numerous times after that before now buying it.<br /><br />Many think it's about religion - it touches on religion and the connection between religion and god, but it is not, in my opinion, a religious movie.  Myself, I am very connected to things spiritual but do not go in for organized religion.  This movie actually made me feel some understanding of the Catholic religion, as the film begins with a simple theme that a woman learned as a little girl - there is nature and there is grace.  I believe this movie begins investigating how these two things fight each other, but winds up bringing them together.  After all, everything is one - this is physics as we now understand it.  Science can help you reach oneness easier than anything these days, and I feel that with the amazing Hubble shots of the universe Malik uses in this film help us &#34;feel&#34; the creation, the infinite, in a way beyond words.  I feel he accomplished that in this film!! That's how much I love it.<br /><br />Yes, there is little dialogue, but I'll tell you that Brad Pitt has never, ever been better while saying less.  He really embodies this man - he looks like Brad Pitt, but he walks like his character, sets his jaw like him, and emanates from his very being a man who loves his family but feels frustrated in his career.  You can feel this split in Pitt's acting - his character is abusive at times, but clearly loves them all.  That's good acting!  Jessica Chastain is gorgeously ethereal - her wife/mother is also struggling at times, wanting to understand god and her husband.  And when her character whispers &#34;forgive&#34; at one point, I cried with recognition.  We do not have to be doormats, but where there is love, it is worth fighting for.<br /><br />The long sequence of watching their three sons play is amazing in a very subtle way - I watched it with wonder and again, recognition.  I used to play like that.  I am from a time when we were let out early in the day and did not come home till dinner.  To watch this on a big screen is magical - just eavesdropping on these kids' play time!<br /><br />I recommend reading the actual reviews of the movie so you get a good idea of the basic premise of the film.  That won't be enough, because there are surprises and layers of the movie that are too much to go into.  But it will help.  Don't talk while watching it or you will miss a LOT.  Much of what is said is inner dialogue in the characters' own heads.  But it's intense!  Very soul searching - these people are trying to understand the meaning of life, god, why things happen.  That part of it is so human.  But Malik allows us to go beyond this to a place where we don't need to know &#34;why&#34;, we just kind of get it; to touch that part of us that is more than human, it is divine.
B0046UGSNS|2.0|When a movie falters, the director will sometimes lean towards using blatant sex scenes for filler. This film had the guy on guy, women on women, and guy on women sex scenes with too many positions than I care to see in thirty seconds or less. It was to the point of porno. I felt like Ruffalo was abused in this film as he is very talented but they sure wasted him here.
B009DP9D6A|5.0|I was recently listening to Grooveshark on an electronica station, and a song from deadmau5 came on while I was working on a bike and I had never heard these cat's before!! They are excellent!!! The song I heard was Moar ghosts n stuff from another album, but after listening to a few more track's I bought that album, and decided to purchase this one as well. It's ALL GOOD!!!
B008JLEUD0|5.0|Such a strong, beautiful voice!  Poignant lyrics, amazing music....  I love it.  We are so lucky to have access to this music.
B002SJIO5E|2.0|In the finale, the accidentally infected hybrid human is still waiting for his extra-terrestrial ally to return from it's home-world with a cure!<br />A sequel would be interesting to know if the e.t. was honorable, to fulfill it's promise for the only available cure...<br />District 9's special effects were great but, the plot was very depressing regarding the humans wanting to selfishly exploit the alien weapons technology and some of the aliens identified as criminal thieves that were stealing from innocent human citizens their private property computers! The greedy, power hungry father-in-law of the accidentally infected hybrid human man, was total scum for betraying his family (daughter and her husband), to exploit the alien's military technology for his security company's weaponry research & development department. Also, the South African &#34;person of color - i.e. black&#34; criminal gang's boss was both comical and pathetic, to think that eating the e.t.'s flesh would give them the ability to activate their acquired alien weapons, to bypass those weapon's security safety measures! The human guys buying sex from the alien prostitutes was repulsively depraved (y-y-yuk)! To think that e.t.'s with advanced military technology would possibly not be benevolent but, criminals instead is very depressing! I've always hoped that if first contact were made, that it would be peaceful and remain that way!<br />A sequel could counter balance the first movie's negativism, by being very optimistic where the aliens (don't have a prime directive policy of not sharing technology) but, are extremely generous! Good diplomatic relations by beginning with healing the infected hybrid man and far,far more could result! The moral of the story, is you shouldn't judge humans or an e.t. alien specie by if they're physically attractive or not but. instead by their ethics! Cool, huh-h-h?
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|Done beautifully... Ang Lee is amazing! Actors were sooooo great, cinematography was spectacular.  One of the rare times I liked the movie. Ore than the book.
0385344228|5.0|It is not often that a book takes me by surprise but Defending Jacob did, I so did not see that ending coming, I don't want to give too much away you just need to read this book.  This novel revolves around the Barber family; Andy Barber, top Assistant DA, his wife Laurie and their 14 year old son Jacob; living in the prestige town of Newton Massachusetts.  Jacob is accused of murdering his classmate, Ben Rifkin and in the state of Massachusetts must be tried as an adult.  Throughout the book Jacob claims he is innocents, William Landay will keep you dithering throughout the book- guilty .. not gulity - he certainly had me question Jacob's guilt or innocents.  To throw you off we hear Andy being questioned in front of a grand jury - but why?  Defending Jacob is well written, Landry will keep you on your toes with lots of twist and turn but the ending will definitely leave you with your mouth open.  A must read!<br /><br />Grover Gardner narrated this book and was superb.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I didn't purchase this book until after the death of Chris Kyle.  It made reading the book bittersweet, especially when he wrote about the death of comrades, and potentially himself.  The way he died caused me to realize how safe he felt at the time, making it all the more tragic.  The world was a better place with him in it.
B004U8VX2M|1.0|I felt that this show was very antiquated and slow moving.  Perhaps I feel this way because I had the same expectations for this show that were presented in Downtown Abbey.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Simple to use.  It helps me sample videos and songs for a few days.  If I like them, I usual end up buying the high quality version of the song from Amazon.
B00511QI4A|4.0|The book was very interesting. I loved the twists in the story and I particularly liked the action and the description of the crimes committed. I do, however, feel that it would be more enjoyable to techno geeks instead of laymen because much of the terminology and explanations about the technical aspects were over my head. I was disappointed that Jason Archer had in fact dies but more disappointed that Sydney did not invite Sawyer to spend Christmas with her and her family. I do understand that he has his own family but a romantic twist is what I had expected. Frank Hardy's involvement was a complete surprise! Well done! I would never have guessed. Nor would I have guessed Gamble's involvement. A good book which had me looking forward to the evenings when I could chill out and read!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is a heart breaking book that will make you cry and smile. It helps you understand so much about how all you have to do is make someone feel normal.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|This was a good read! Can't wait for the next book to come out... good love story, good heat, and good storyline
B003ODIZL6|4.0|Has great quality of content but lacks quantity and actual girth of content for this book to be practically used.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A long recovery from mental breakdown turned into a fun an endearing journey to reality, acceptance, and the need for love and companionship. I began reading and couldn't stop, rooting for Pat then Tiffany to find their silver lining.<br />What some would call a not so normal family, and others will  see as just a little less than splendidly normal.<br /><br />ENJOY
B00138KJY0|5.0|Because of the tremendous popularity of Thriller, it's predecessor, Off the Wall, is overlooked.  There are many good songs from this album that didn't make it to The Essential and other Michael compilation albums.

B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This game is addicting and probably the 2nd best game out there.<br />Tip: if your using the tilting screen affect to make turns easier just turn up the sensitivity.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Acting was superb.  Nice to see the English actors and actresses i love in different roles.  Dorcas is a delight, Laura is growing up, Queenie & Twister are more than excentric, Mrs.Arliss is divine, Thomas supports well while being pious, and oh the sisters Pratt (you'll see), Alfie has a true heart and Timothy is arrogant as expected but conflicted.  As are all the others, well played and fun to see what comes next.  If you like the English Drama's you will like this too I think.  Give it a try.
B00280LYHS|4.0|This was a very good conclusion to this wonderful series of Greek god and titans. Anyone who has read the books before this will truly enjoy it!!!!

B00A80SHFM|5.0|We if you saw the stage production several times, you will appreciate this movie version even more!  The music for the scenes becomes so very clear for the plot, that Hugo's classic book actually comes alive.  This is a must have cd.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I've been using a Weber Rapidfire chimney for about 15 years and will never look back at the lighter fluid days again. I have Weber 22in, 18-1/2in and a Smokey Joe. The amount of charcoal for the Joe was always hard to gauge in the large chimney.....then I found this compact Rapidfire chimney on Amazon (I never seen them in stores). It's alot easier to figure how much charcoal you need, plus it lights more evenly because it's \\"stacked \\" better as apposed to a little bit of coals in the large chimney. Works great! I would recomend it to anyone with a small table top type charcoal grill. Ditch the lighter fluid!
B000A0K2JO|4.0|I can't complain, I really haven't used it. The USB ports on the mother board works great with USB Keyboard and Mouse. If I need more USB Ports to be free then I'll use this adapter.

B007EDCWHA|5.0|I love this book because the boundaries it and by reading u get to be in their world's and see everything how they saw it. You also learn way more about who they really are individuals not just one direction so read this book!
B002GJT4XW|5.0|If you read the Harry Potter books before seeing the movies, this is the one that will take a lot to get used to.  Then you will get a feel for how much they have to cut from the books to make the movie, and get used to the characters etc.  After that movies are almost perfect. The special effects are amazing, the casting was great and as you probably know the story is very very good.<br /><br />The only drawback to this film is that the kids were so young, and so inexperienced as actors that their performances were very forced at times.  Luckily those who did the casting found actors who could learn quickly and develop great skills so that even by the second movie they had their characters down and really became those characters.  Of course all of the adult casting was great.  Snape is played perfectly by Alan Rickman, and Richard Harris was perfect as Dumbledore.  The only bad thing about the movies was that he passed away before they were complete and the actor they brought in to replace him was just not the same. He played him differently, and did not give the character the same feel as Harris did.<br /><br />All in all, this movie sets up the series well.  It introduces the characters, blends the humor with elements of the dark material that would come in the subsequent films and told the story from the book as well as could have been done.  There are portion of even the first book that had to be cut out, and as the books got longer and longer more would have to be cut.  The Ultimate Edition, while giving an extended version of the movie does not replace much of the material that was cut from the book, just enhances the theatrical version of the film.  The big ticket item on the Ultimate Edition are the extras, specifically the five part documentary series that is the focus of the second disk.  In this set it is Creating the World of Harry Potter.  They talk about finding the cast, filming and how they created Howart's, the Quidditch arena, the various locations used etc.  Not just in the first movie, but throughout the series.  You also get things like the trailers, TV spots, Deleted Scenes, and a bunch of interactive content.<br /><br />If you love the books and want to get the most out of the movies you can than this is a must have for your collection.  Even though it is probably the weakest of all the movies, it is still an excellent film.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I was stupefied by the first episode and got hooked about half way through. It was like going to the movies it is so well made. I'm just getting started on season 2 and still loving it.
B002GJT4YQ|5.0|This part of the story got much darker than in the first movie/book.  It was imperative that the actors playing the main character improved from the first and they did.  They were still quite young in this movie since it was shot basically right after the first one.  But you can tell that their performances were far less forced than in the first one.<br /><br />Like with the first movie they had to cut a lot out of the books, but they did keep the important parts of the story and the story flowed very well.  I also thought the special effects were well done and were incorporated nicely into the real sets. The standout character introduced in this film was Lucious Malfoy.  He had the sinister, evil slime ball character down.  There was not an ounce of sincerity in anything (aside from the evil parts) and it worked very well.  Also I liked what they did with Dobby.  Although a lot of that character was removed from what was in the books (more so in the next films than this one), he did provide some comic relief and helped to move the story along.<br /><br />As for the extras, like the first Ultimate Edition set you get a lot of behind the scenes material.  This time focused on the various characters.  Again they discussed characters from all the films, but the slant was toward the second movie.  There are also a lot of deleted scenes (most of which ended up in the extended version of the movie), then some interactive material on the third disc.<br /><br />Again if you are a fan of the movies and books and want the most extras you can get then you want to add this to your collection.

B00BDPW7XE|5.0|Discovered this band a few years ago now , and I've been lucky enough to acquire all their recordings (including the very rare \\"Bard\\") , and I can't stop listening to this great band.<br />Although all their recordings are similar , they each provide a unique listening experience .<br />\\"English Electric Part 2\\" features the usage of strings and brass in a very esoteric fashion. The instruments always decorate the music and do not take away anything from more traditional prog instrumentation.<br />I could hardly wait the time between part one and part two ; now I'm salivating for what's next on the Big Big Train track.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|E L James continues the amazing love story and does just as an amazing job as the first book. The third  book is just as amazing as well.  I'm so in love with this series. A must read!

B0094K1PW4|4.0|Amusing and different approach to filming and story. Kind of a combination of ET, Goonies, and serious scifi story lines.

0141034599|3.0|I just finished the book and was compelled to contribute something different to the reviews.  Taleb is one of the rare people who worked in private practice in the financial industry, was very successful financially and is now an academic and economic advisor. His business made investor's a fortune when \\"unpredicatble\\" swan events happened (although he was positioned to take advantage of them). If you are interested in managing risk and gaining an insight how \\"experts\\" make mistakes and how it can effect you, read the book. If you are not - do not bother.<br /><br />I found his references to \\"experts\\" fascinating (using searches to find out more about those people making the book a long read). His personal experience in Lebanon is inciteful. Yet his writing sytle is inexplicable, seemingly all over the place, never being quite sure if he was relaying fact or fiction to punch home a point. He mixes mathematics, philosophy and commentary throughout the prose, making for a challenging read.<br /><br />What will you gain from reading this text? Perhaps a new skepticism of our so called experts in finance, business and government. Perhaps a better understanding on how financial risk is managed and the underlying traps associated with the models. And for the mathematicians in the group, perhaps an insight into the fundamental issues/problems with applying gaussian models (bell curve) to life.<br /><br />Taleb provides the beginnings of a framework to understand or anticipate the Black Swan events turning them into Grey Swans that you can take advantage of.

B001FD5KJM|5.0|This film is spectacular.<br /><br />Robert Downey Jr. is amazing as Tony Stark/Iron Man.<br /><br />This movie is brilliant.  I love the visuals.  They are spectacular.  The cast is also amazing.  The plot is very interesting which makes Iron Man a great start to the Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br /><br />There are a few scary scenes in this movie, so I recommend it for people over ten.<br /><br />I recommend this movie.
1594481717|5.0|Design matters today more than ever.  We seek experiences when shopping and demand great design from our iPhones and products.  Creativity and innovation is derived from connecting the dots.  I believe is this a must read for our new connected tech driven economy.
B00BSBT8M6|3.0|Watching it on a small tv didn't allow the beautiful scenes to shine. Not as great as the book but I feel like that is always the case.
B005OT2YVA|3.0|The movie was good, special effect awesome as usual, but the movie as a whole was kinda reaching. Guess they just needed to make make money after they paid for the licensing.
B0089AD8IO|5.0|A must have for any Doctor Who fan. Not only is Christopher Eccleston revealed as the New Doctor, but Billie Piper is also introduced as the Doctor's companion.  The dvd arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|Every single song hits the soul. A must listen to. The band is just getting better and better in each and every. Album release.
B00001OH7V|5.0|This CD is great and is relevant to what Bowie is doing now on &#34;The Next Day.&#34; The first two tracks are excellent songs. There are some cool instrumentals here like Bowie did on &#34;Low.&#34; Overall, this is a great microcosm of what Bowie was doing during his Berlin days.

0805047905|2.0|I ordered this little hardback book &#34;new&#34;, not &#34;used&#34;.  When I received the book, it, along with another children's book I ordered at the same time, were damaged in shipping.  The bottom of the spine of this book was damaged.  These books were placed inside a paper envelope that did not withstand the rigors of shipping.  I order a lot from Amazon, and only one other time had anything damaged in shipping.

B0081336FO|5.0|What a great series!  I wish we didn't have to wait until next year for season 3!  What a cliffhanger!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is probably the most accurate battery meter out on the market, as it not only tells you how much battery you have left, but also how much time you have left to do certain things such as video playback or music!
B00BHMF578|4.0|It was very interesting and always kept the viewers attention. Only negative was that it was not always factually accurate. The scenes that were replicated fro actual events were amazing.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It would be better if it had a share on your friends page option and it actually showed the pictures/videos of links you post like my phone does. It only shows the link and only allows you to share on your own page.
B00280LYIM|5.0|For kids and adults. Humor and adventure.<br />Loved the continuation from the last book and you could probably skip some books and still understand what's going on. Can't wait to read the next one.
B000SEGTI0|5.0|I bought this book because I liked the movie, blade runner.  It was different, but I was not disappointed with it.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|Good for kids. Advanced ideas, classic monster, low gore, healthy representation of multiple socio economic roles. Will make sure every child I have sees it.
B006WSKTPU|5.0|Really fun show, kept me in splits! Looking forward to the next set of shows of this really fun TV series.
B005R2S3VE|3.0|It is what it is. The original line up. 7 songs. I never saw Terry Kath before. I never saw Peter Cetera live in Chicago before. I never saw the original drummer live before. Till I saw this dvd. It was interesting. However, don't expect surround sound, don't expect hi definition. It's about the quality you would find from the 70's. It's not as bad as other reviews make it sound.<br />It is what it is. Sound is 2.0
B0089XH38M|4.0|It works for me and has been better than any other app I have used. AVG has not let me down yet and I would not change it unless I just had too.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|Keep my computer quite cool.  lots of overheating problems before but with this beast it's great.  Without a larger case you can't run it tho.
B00BMCLCG6|4.0|I agree with those who say many of the low reviews are being too critical of this album.  Sure, it's unlikely to match New Jersey or Slippery When Wet.  But when taken on its own, I think it's a solid, 4-star album.  And having listened to a couple of Bon Jovi's '90s and '00's albums after this one (such as These Days), I think it's comparable to those.  You just can't go in to it expecting every song to be a hit like Livin' On A Prayer or It's My Life.<br /><br />That said, there aren't any tracks that are as hard rock as many classic Bon Jovi hits like those.  But not every great Bon Jovi song is a hard rock song.  And I think there are a few tracks on here that have a chance at becoming classics.  The deciding factor for me in making this a 4-star review was when I found myself humming one of these songs (\\"I'm With You\\") after listening to a couple older BJ songs from the Greatest Hits CD in my car, after having only listened to this album twice.  There are a lot of albums where that wouldn't have happened.<br /><br />Favorite tracks of mine include \\"Because We Can\\", \\"I'm With You\\", \\"That's What The Water Made Me\\", and \\"Beautiful World\\".  \\"Amen\\" reminded me of the earlier Bon Jovi track \\"Make a Memory\\" musically; a good thing in my book.<br /><br />The only disappointing part is that I felt the 4 new tracks on the Greatest Hits CD from 2010 (\\"The More Things Change\\", \\"This Is Love, This Is Life\\", \\"What Do You Got?\\", \\"No Apologies\\") were all better examples of the harder-rock, traditional Bon Jovi style than any of the tracks on this CD.  While that made them fit in well with that collection, it would've been nice to see at least one more like those on this CD.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|love it very fun and addictive! was hard 4 me to control at first but u can change it in the settings..... give it a try:)

B0083ZRAJS|5.0|I loved this book! I had to read it for a classic for my language arts class and I read it in 2 weeks I loved it and you will too.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|I did a three hour podcast on the &#34;We're with the Band&#34; show (episode bowie look it up) about this album and bowie in general. Also a lot of talk about Hoggle...anyway, This record rocks. Bowie sounds pissed! the drums are huge the guitars have bite. This is the bowie record I've always wanted but never asked for. I let bowie lead when we dance. Yes this is the worst art work in bowie history but you can't hear that when you listen to the record. Get the version with the bonus tracks because they are really solid.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Short review here; First of all, happy 66th birthday to David Bowie & thank you for a great new collection of songs!<br /><br />I was feeling a bit blah this morning when I decided to give this new album a spin and with all of the up-tempo rockers, David's vocals a little tighter and higher pitched than on many of his post \\"Scary Monsters\\" albums (I've always preferred this style of David Bowie's vocalizing) I cheered up right away and had a blast! The album flew by, as time seems to when having fun and wow, this is an excellent sounding CD that rocks from the opening notes right through to the end. I like every song here, not so much for the lyrics which I'd say overall are neutral (i.e., some junk, some good) but rather for the great upbeat sound of the songs. (\\"I'd Rather Be High\\" is one of the better worded songs with \\"I'd rather be high, I'd rather be flying, I'd rather be dead or out of my head than training these guns at those men in the sand\\"). I couldn't agree more with David's statement here! Overall, some song lyrics aside, I really enjoyed listening to this new disc.<br /><br />Easily one of his best new albums since Scary Monsters (I would compare this new disc most closely to \\"Hours\\"). I very much like his 80's, 90's & early 2000's music and this is as good as anything he has released over that time period.<br /><br />Highly recommended to fans new and old, enjoy & God bless :-)
B00AFEY354|5.0|I recommend this to everyone. It is the Catcher in the Rye for a modern generation. Way better the atlas shrugged just saying.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|The 3d picture was very grainy like an old  1940s black and White movie. Every thing else was fine with the other copies.

B00AZM7IQC|4.0|I have been to a cirque de soleil  live show before and found this movie to be as good as being there live.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|If you are a big fan of Bruce Willis then by all means you'll want to see this movie. As for me, wish I'd past. While it is an intriging premise for a movie it was hard to keep up with all the going back and forth. Other than that it's just a typical shoot 'em up Bruce Willis movie. Not bad but not good .. just OK
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is very addictive. I have to play a couple times a day. I highly recommend it, as it helps with relfexes too.
B007BRJYF2|5.0|I really liked this game on my Kindle Fire.  There were quite a lot of levels, which I like.  It worked fine on my Kindle, and the graphics were quite good. I recommend this for anyone who enjoys hidden picture games.
B005ILYWN2|4.0|I watched Troll Hunter because I was bored and nothing was on TV, so I watched it via Netfix.  As I was about to select another movie, about 12 minutes into this, the action picked up as did the story.  It pulls you in with both special affects as well as filming method (like a documentary).  I don't like subtitled films, but this one didn't bother me as much as I thought it would.  In fact after 15 minutes, I forgot it was all subtitled as I was drawn into the story and action. I was very happy to find this on Amazon on blu-ray. The unique combination of film style, in your face action, folk lore and story is very good.  Who says foreign films are all bad?  Not me any more!  Oh, and my kids loved it too!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|Really love it. Great product, works well and very useful.  Excellent tool with easy to ready statistics readily available. .

B000JMKNV0|5.0|Having already watched the movie, I read the book just to see how well they stuck to Lehane's original idea and to answer a few questions that the movie left out there.  Even though I knew how it all ended, I was entranced throughout, which is a testament to Lehane's masterful story telling.  Well worth the price.

B005CRQ4XI|5.0|What a beautiful told story. Read on the eve of hiking the W circuit in Patagonia. While not nearly as vast in distance as Cheryl's trip, traveling to Torres del Paine national park from Austin TX alone to go find something,yet not knowing what, this seems like one of those coinky dinks that people talk about. I leave in 6 days and while I have been somewhat terrified as this day approached, i have been at the same time excited at the prospect of hiking at the ends of the earth, then going on to Buenos Aires to a Pearl Jam concert that precipitated all this bravery in the first place! Strange the things that move us on in our lives. I saw Eddie Veddar in concert last November. So moved and inspired by him and the purity of his love of his craft and the things he holds dear, and his ridiculous talent and music, next thing I knew I had planned a hike at the ends of the earth, and bought vip tickets to see Pearl Jam at an ecological reserve in Buenos Aires. Like Cheryl, I am looking for something and I am not quite sure what it is. Like Cheryl, I am willing to travel to the ends of the earth alone to find it. Like Cheryl, I keep casting fear aside though I feel it profoundly. I can only hope that all turns out well, and that I discover the peace she found at the end of her adventurous journey. Well done Cheryl...well done!

B009EAO38C|5.0|Most of the music and thing heard about ThePianoGuys was on Youtube and loved their music before. Now finally having an album with all my favorite songs on it is great! This music takes modern songs and not only turns them in to a classical song, but has that unforgettable PianoGuys sound to it. The quality is great and you definitely get your money's worth for the amount of songs that come on this album. All and all this is definitely an album worth buying.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I am not into scary shows or lots of gore, but the characters in the show just grip you into the story line. The actor's play their roles amazingly well.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The writing gets better and better -not weaker and desperate. It's nice to see the life hasn't left the Walking Dead yet!
0670023329|4.0|The story is there. It is a fantastic one. This young man is amazing, his ordeal is amazing and the fact that he made it out alive is nothing short of a miracle. My only complaint is the writing is a bit choppy and sometimes a little scattered. Aside from that, it is a quick read, and definitely worth a few hours time. In the end, I am left wondering how South Korea could be so indifferent to its northern neighbor and when will North Korea's brutal, corrupt government finally fall?
0062073613|3.0|In her second full-length Miss Marple mystery, Agatha Christie once again shocked the quiet village of St Mary Mead with the appearance of a body in the library of a well-to-do home. Neither of the owners know who the dead girl is, nor how she came to be deceased in their house, and when the wife calls neighbor Miss Marple by to visit her and help figure out how this confusion came to be, you know you're in for a good mystery.<br /><br />When the dead body is identified as a dancer from a nearby resort, Miss Marple and Mrs Bantry (the homeowner's wife) travel to the hotel to try and ascertain who would want the young girl dead and why on earth they chose to put her in Colonel Bantry's library. While there, they unwrap a series of strange family dynamics involving an ill wealthy widower, his ne'er-do-well son-in-law, his quiet daughter-in-law, his precocious step-grandson, as well as the dead girl's cousin. Combine that with a local missing girl scout and you have a case that is tangled in more knots than a ratty shoelace.<br /><br />Of course, Miss Marple, along with the inspectors from the police and Scotland Yard, are able to untangle the problems and come to the heart of the matter. Unfortunately, this one doesn't leave as many clues for the reader as some of Christie's other works, but it's sill a delightful peek into a sleepy way of life long-gone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is an amazing Bible app.  It is so comprehensive and user friendly. You get a choice of numerous translations and the ability to switch as you are reading to get a different translation. Also has multiple reading/devotion plans that you may choose and it keeps track for you,syncing to multiple devices and even reminding you each day to read.<br />  I particularly I love the quick search for a verse during church or a study with just a few taps.<br />I have recommended this to several friends. Better yet currently it is FREE!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I found this story, in it's very detail, to be heartwarming and engrossing. I became entwined in the characters lives and anticipated the next happening. I will continue to read the neck three books in the saga.
B00BP4WAZS|4.0|this movie was I liked it.  my 3 year old did not care for it, and my 6 year old was ho-hum with it.
B00008G7UJ|5.0|I use this in my English classes when I teach &#34;Romeo and and Juliet.&#34;  The DVD came with extras which I did not know and it is great!
B0040UEI7C|5.0|The singers give a moving presentation of the Aida story.  The orchestra is also excellent.  I highly recommend this recording.
B000096I9G|3.0|I bought this on DVD the day it came out and I love the performances but the DVD freezes up for some reason. I have played it in several different DVD, Bluray, and game systems and it freezes up at the same part on all player. The disc has no scratches or anything. I don't know if this is common but it really irked me.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Star Trek: Voyager continues to impressed and never let down. Unlike many other series, it doesn't find itself  having to change pace or improvising to stay relevant. The awesome final &#34;flight&#34; home brings a worthy end to their long journey.
0399229191|5.0|It is just what I expected. It's a really great and colorful Eric Carle book! Kids love the bumpy spider web!
B007REV4YI|5.0|Seen them all.  This is by far the best Bond movie ever (although some of the others are fun and enjoyable too in their own way).  The Bond folks took their time on this one, because if they blew this like they did on Quantum of Solace, the Bond franchise would be over.  I ordered it a day or so after it came out and got it in just a few days.  Amazon is the best.
0887081770|3.0|I did not realize how small this book would be. I guess I did not read the description carefully enough. I shoul have spent more and gotten the bigger version, which I really like. (I saw it at the library)
1400067820|5.0|This book should be forbidden, because it will make our modern life disappear, just like that. And that will favor only our children :)
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This app keeps me busy for hours on end. I love to draw, but when it all comes to life on your screen, it really is amazing. To be honest, I can draw better on this game than on a piece of paper, so......<br /><br />  FIVE STARS!!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I enjoyed the interpersonal conflicts. Kept me entertained and held my interest. Enjoyable. Lively dialogue and descriptive, steamy bedroom scenes.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|Hate is a pretty strong word to use to describe my experience with this product, though I'm at a loss to come up with a softer yet equally telling word to convey my regard, or lack there of, for this Alfa adapter. I am returning the adapter to Amazon for four reasons. (1)The included CD Rom would not load the drivers needed to run the device on my OS, Windows 7. It only managed to mess up my computer by installing a dialog window that I could not delete without shuting down the computer and restart it. (2) I called the tech support team only to find that they were closed until Monday 10 am. That call was a disappointment as well. The tech sent a link to the drivers that did not work. (3) It was difficult to find the drivers on line. (4) After loading the drivers I eventually fond at a different web site, the adapter functioned for about five minutes before it caused enough damage to my registry to cause me to have to restore the system to a time previous to my installing the Alfa product. My computer is working fine now, but I will not, under any circumstances, ever load an Alfa product again. Enough is enough.
B007SGM084|5.0|It is what it is...although the books could have been written better, I really enjoyed the characters. I laughed and moments i felt there pain. All in all the story was clear and full of memorable characters. I highly recommend it! :)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I AM ABOUT THE LAST PERSON WHO USUALLY PLAYS COMPUTER GAMES BUT I AM AT LEVEL 332 AND CAN'T STOP PLAYING.  LOTS OF FUN!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This free app lets me use my tablet as a kindle and works without any problems. Very handy. I'd recommend.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Anita did a good job explaining her experience and what it meant.  Especially, when words are not sufficient in describing this awesome experience. It resonated with me deeply.  I highly recommend this book.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|Certain of the elements in this movie were taken from actual footage.  It is unclear how much of the involvement of the CIA is fact and fiction by a casual viewing of this movie. Thirtysomethings watching this movie will learn about the Iran Hostage crisis and get some entertainment and suspense.
B00BHU9DUK|2.0|Many versions of the story are in film that are far less obtuse than this particular production.  Is hard to follow.
B009VIZDLI|4.0|I enjoyed this book and at times laughed out loud - always a good sign.  A pleasant read that I would definitely recommend.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved it. This book gave me a mystifying feeling. It was soo intense. It was a little confusing though.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game Subway Surfer is great. I lobe how you tour different parts of the world and how the game stays up to daye and it corresponds with what is in. The way the holidays line up with the scenery is great. I &lt;3 SUBWAY SURFER!!!
B004VMUS9G|2.0|Too difficult to navigate.  I knew I would never use it so I deleted it. I hate that there is a minimum number of words required to leave these reviews!
B0086900TI|5.0|Received as ordered - was happy with this process and will continue to visit this site if my one concern is addressed
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great way to pass the time at the airport - waiting in the Drs office or just to unwind for the day
