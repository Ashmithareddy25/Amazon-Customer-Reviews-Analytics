B000063DHL|4.0|hmmm...this album just didn't quite do it for me in the way that IM's other albums really hooked me.  This is still an awesome CD, but in comparison to their other works, not quite up to standards.  Much like seventh son of a seventh son, I was disappointed with their choice of an opening track.  Somewhere in time is a good song, but doesn't seem to be the best way to kick off an album.  Wasted years is really an awesome song for the intro alone, let alone the crazy vocal harmonies on the chorus  and the musicianship in general.  Sea of madness is awesome and just a little spooky.  Heaven can wait struck me as a little too long, but dickinson's melodic wails keep it interesting.  The loneliness of the long distance runner is great driving music as it keeps the speed and intensity going.  Stranger in a strange land has a killer bass line, but seems just a little off from the rest of the album.  Deja vu is a pretty cool song and Alexander the great is another epic that provides a perfect ending to a high quality album.<br /><br />TRACK RATINGS<br /><br />caught somewhere in time 6/10<br /><br />Wasted Years 9/10<br /><br />Sea of Madness 10/10<br /><br />Heaven can Wait 6/10<br /><br />The loneliness of the long distance runner 9/10<br /><br />Stranger in a strange land 6/10<br /><br />Deja Vu 8/10<br /><br />Alexander the great 10/10
B00005MK9Y|5.0|This is not an actual live concert, but rather 2 or 3 from the Bob Marley and the Wailers 1977-78 tours of Europe.  During this time period the band was gaining much more popularity.  The Wailers were much bigger in Europe than they were here in the states, but none the less this is still a record that should be purchased by anyone wanting to start a reggae collection.  This was the first Bob Marley and the Wailers cd I puchased, and after listening to it I couldn't stop.  If you think the Wailers are good in the studio, they will blow you away with their live performances here.  This cd is of very good quality, and the rythm section of the Barret brothers dominates everything.  There are some great bass lines, and some even better drumming displayed on this record.  I highly reccommend this to anyone who is a fan of the Wailers, and even if you aren't a fan this will make you into a fan.
B0007MUS4O|4.0|This 1975 album is uneven but it contains at least four classics in the marvellous title track with its gripping mix of sax, brilliant rhythms and lyrics rich with imagery, the infectious Fame, a song co-written with John Lennon and Carlos Alomar, and another Beatles song, Across The Universe. This version of John I'm Only Dancing (Again) was added later and it fits in well with the overall mood and sound of the album. Another good track is Win, but the rest is rather forgettable although the overall sound is cohesive enough to provide a pleasant listening experience. What makes it work, are the sax contributions of David Sanborn, the buoyant percussion and the backing vocals of the great Luther Vandross. The result is a seamless blend of Philadelphia soul and rock, a style that became in a sense a precursor to the disco explosion that was soon to follow. With the additional tracks on this enhanced album, Young Americans now earns a four star rating.
B000063DIH|4.0|This album is definitely not a fan favorite, save for a few of the songs.  I was right up there with most people when I first listened to this album.  I was disappointed with the musical direction this album seemed to take.  There simply wasn't enough of that Iron Maiden Flare.  However, after a few listening's parts of the album really started to grow on me.  While all of the tracks lack the timeless quality of Maiden's earlier releases such as powerslave or the number of the beast, they at least serve the purpose of entertaining the listener.  Be quick or be dead is a good old school maiden style track that starts off the album nicely.  From here to eternity at least has a catchy chorus.  Afraid to shoot strangers has some interesting use of bass chords that add an ominous quality to the song.  Fear is the key, childhood's end, and wasting love are all fairly generic, but have some interesting musical qualities that are at least pleasing to the ear.  Chains of misery, Judas my guide, the apparition, and weekend warrior are all quite good and really have a toe tapping kind of element to them.  Fear of the dark is most definitely the best song on this album and serves as a terrific closer. <br />TRACK RATINGS <br />be quick or be dead 7/10 <br />from here to eternity 7/10 <br />afraid to shoot strangers 7/10 <br />fear is the key 7/10 <br />childhood's end 6/10 <br />wasting love 6/10 <br />chains of misery 9/10 <br />judas my guide 8/10 <br />the apparition 9/10 <br />weekend warrior 8/10 <br />Fear of the dark 10/10
B00005KB9T|5.0|When the Wailers were signed to island records in 1972, this marked the beginning of reggae to an international audience.  The Wailers were already famous throughout the Carribbean, but worldwide they were nobody's.  Catch a Fire changed all that. This was packaged as a rock album and the original album sleeve was actually a zippo lighter and when you opened the lighter the record would come out.  This  artwork is not original.  The sound tapes were actually overdubbed with rock giutars and other instruments to make this album appeal to an American and English audience.  To hear the original versions, check out Catch a Fire Deluxe Edition which has the original Jamaican versions, and the versions heard here.  This is still a great recording, but the Deluxe Edition has the original Jamaican versions which are a real treat.
B0000009LI|4.0|Heroes was the second album in Bowie's trilogy of Brian Eno produced electronic albums. It follows the pattern of Low in its mix of short pop/rock songs and moody instrumentals and semi-instrumentals. Somehow it lacks the trenchant edge of Low, although the title track is truly spectacular in its evocative imagery and great emotional impact.<br /><br />On the title track, Bowie's voice is as emotive as on Word On A Wing (from Station To Station) over the wailing drone of the synths as it paints a scenario of lovers meeting beneath the Berlin wall. Truly breathtaking, this song was also released as a single in German and French versions in the seventies.<br /><br />The melancholy Sons Of The Silent Age has a spacey feel, beautiful lyrics and a ghostly chorus, while Blackout is harsh and discordant. I love the sax and the driving beat of V2 Schneider as Bowie's voice intones the title. Moss Garden is a delicate instrumental, a sound I recognized later in some pieces by e.g. Autechre and Cabaret Voltaire, but Secret Life Of Arabia drags a bit.<br /><br />Lodger, the third album in the trilogy, is nowhere near as good as the first two. Heroes remains my favorite of the three, primarily on account of the unsurpassable title track.
B000063DFN|5.0|This is easily my favorite Iron Maiden album (surprise surprise, right?) and simply just kicks your a$$ from start to finish with some of the finest musicianship out there.  The album starts out intensely strong with the unforgettable intro to Aces High making the listener know they are in for one hell of a ride.  2 Minutes to midnight (quite possibly my favorite maiden song) keeps the momentum up.  Losfer Words is a nice instrumental touch, but without something to croon along too, loses a point or two.  The chorus of flash of the blade will remain stuck in your head for days And the solos in the following track (the duellists) are some of the finest maiden work out there.  Back in the Village is probably the least amazing track on here, but once again, killer guitars really pull it through.  Powerslave is just an awesomely creepy song, and Rime of the Ancient Mariner (while just a little long) is Truly an epic work.<br /><br />TRACK RATINGS<br /><br />Aces High 10/10<br /><br />2 Minutes to Midnight 10/10<br /><br />Losfer Words 8/10<br /><br />Flash of the Blade 10/10<br /><br />The Duellists 9/10<br /><br />Back in the Village 7/10<br /><br />Powerslave 9/10<br /><br />Rime of the Ancient Mariner 8/10
B00005LANG|5.0|Exodus (the movement of JAH People) was time magazine's album of the century, that should say enough right there.  But if you are not convinced buy it and you will be for sure.  This album was released in 1977, and was recorded in London England.  Bob Marley and members of the band survived an attempted assination in December of 1976, and went into self imposed exile in London.  Here the creativity of the band is quite good, and many of the Songs that you know by Bob Marley and the Wailers appear on this disc.  Jamming, Exodus, One Love, Three Little Birds, and Waiting In Vain. All the tracks are great on this disc and you can hear for the first time in all of the Wailers recordings that the quality of the recording equipment here is much better.  The dummer's (Carlton Barrett) high hat never came through so clear. This album marks the intro of Junior Marvin (lead guitar)to the band. The band was about to gain superstar status and this album marks the beginning.  If you crave more Jamming, check out the Exodus Deluxe Edition, it offers a second disc with part of a concert from the Rainbow Theater, and some rare Lee Perry tracks that will surely move you.  This album is the album of the cetury, and you should own it for yourself, reguardless of you liking reggae or not.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This movie is very stupid and pointless, which is why I love it!  Napoleon is hilarious, trying to dance and always eating tatertots. Pedro, running for school president, is very funny, always looking bored and repliying with only a couple of words while looking down and tired.  Deb, is a very shy, yet funny girl who is a rising photographer and makes her own sleeves (buy this movie to see what I am talking about).  And then Kip.......  Here are 5 words describing Kip.  feminen, boring, ladies man, really boring, and HILARIOUS.  No review will tell you how good this movie really is.  To find out, you have to click the, \\"Buy\\" button at the top of this page, to experience a great worthwhile movie which will keep you laughing the whole time.  Thanks! <br /> <br />P.S. BURTON SNOWBOARDING ROCKS!
B000063DI9|5.0|I'm amazed that something as small as the addition of synthesizers could cause that much aversion towards this truly awesome album.  I have heard the releases before this, I have heard the releases after this, and I would say this fits in perfectly with the stylistic evolution of Iron Maiden.  The sound is in a word experimental, but bands need to grow and I think this was a fine step for IM.  I was a bit surprised at the opening track, moonchild.  The band is usually pretty good at getting an awesome song to kick off an album but for some reason moon child just wasn't quite there.  probably my least favorite song on the album.  Infinite dreams and Can I play with madness? are easily the best tracks on the album with catchy melodies for the former and a very high energy sound for the latter.  The evil that men do isn't quite the stuff classics are made of, but an enjoyable track nonetheless.  The title track is very intense but a bit too long to really hold the listener's attention.  The prophecy is just generally pretty cool and the clairvoyant is very intense and lyrically out there.  The closing track, only the good die young, is a stellar way to close the album.<br /><br />TRACK RATINGS<br /><br />moonchild 6/10<br /><br />infinite dreams 10/10<br /><br />can I play with madness? 10/10<br /><br />the evil that men do 7/10<br /><br />seventh son of a seventh son 7/10<br /><br />the prophecy 8/10<br /><br />the clairvoyant 10/10<br /><br />only the good die young 10/10
B00069YE0W|5.0|This album is the best of John Frusciante's recent releases. It's on par with Shadows Collide With People, but with simpler production. Frusciante is the best and most diverse guitarist of his generation and one of the best overall musicians of his time. There's not one bad song on any of his recent albums. His are the kind of records you listen to over and over again. Money is not wasted on his music.
B00000IPAX|5.0|it is the best of there many cds it has really great songs on it such as whats my age again and adams song. it hassome immature things on it it but over all its really good its my favorite its good because all the new stuff is more serious WHAT HAPPEND TO THE OLD BLINK? there newstuff is cool but they should model it around this but anyways this is AWESOME
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Will Farrell captures the essence of innocence as Buddy the elf in \\"Elf,\\" directed by \\"Swingers\\" man Jon Favreau.  From the beginning, this movie catches both the imaginations of young kids and the hearts of adults.  It tells the story of the aforementioned Buddy, an orphaned human baby who is raised by Santa's elves at the North Pole, and his attempt to find his real father who just happens to live in New York.<br /><br />Farrell is perfect as the innocent Buddy.  He is captivated by everything New York.  From the huge buildings to the gum on the handrails at the subway entrance, he takes it all in.  When he finds his father(James Caan), he tries his best to be accepted into the family, but his innocence often gets him in the way or in trouble.  Also, Santa runs into a little trouble on Christmas Eve and has to call on Buddy to help save Christmas.  The result is a heart-warming, happy-ending tale that is perfect to watch at Christmas and year-round.<br /><br />The supporting cast is splendid.  Bob Newhart plays Buddy's adoptive elf father.  Ed Asner plays a wonderful Santa.  Mary Steenburgen plays Caan's wife who is amazed by the childlike simplicity of Buddy.<br /><br />The biggest surprise of this flick is the lovely Zooey Deschanel, who plays a department store elf that Buddy falls hard for.  Their date, including a taste of the \\"world's best coffee,\\" is fun to watch, and Deschanel and Farrell have wonderful chemistry on the screen.<br /><br />Language is pretty light, so the youngsters can watch this.  There are a couple of curse words scattered through the movie, but nothing you can't hear at the mall, unfortunately.  The music is fun.  Deschanel performs \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" with Farrell in the film, and with Leon Redbone in the end credits.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think this film will become a Christmas favorite and eventually rank up there with holiday comedies like \\"A Christmas Story.\\"
6304884419|2.0|This film is way too superficial and phony.  It tries to \\"moralize\\" too much, and none of the characters comes across as believable.  One of the worst movies of all time.
0739302752|2.0|I listened to this book via CDROM.  It is ironic that the 2 executives who speak of execution produced a product barely worthy of it's name.  Many of the case studies didn't have a meaningful conclusion.  The writing is at many times \\"not cohesive\\"  The use of too much long-winded jargon fails to make a point sometimes. I found the narration of executive letters to be difficult to listen to because names, companies, and projects were changed to the point where it was not relatable. I think this is one of those books where the administrative assistant wrote the book on company time.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|Like one of the other reviewers, I too was introduced to this film in the late 80's under the title, \\"Warriors of the Wind\\". My brother in law had rented the movie for his son. The entire family watched the movie and loved it. When I first saw this film, I thought even then, it was a great movie.. even for a cartoon. In those days, I had no real appreciation for animated films as art as I do now. This movie helped change my views of these kinds of movies.    Even in the edited, bootleg, incomplete version of the 80's \\"Warrior's\\", few animated films can match it.        Princess Mononoke doesn't even come close.
B00020HEL6|5.0|This CD is outstanding.  The musicians are excellent and so are the arrangments giving a big band sound at times and a superb trio/quartet sounds at other times.  Listening to the way Renee Olstead belts out songs on this CD reminds me so much of some of the great bands and vocalists I got to listen and dance to back in the 40s and early 50s.<br /><br />There are a variety of the well-known old tunes sung in outstanding ways by Renee.  She has a beautiful voice and that real jazz touch. She also adds plenty of excitement to the appropriate tunes.<br /><br />It is even more amazing that she is 15 years old.  I see her on TV and find it hard to believe that this pretty little girl has so much talent and feel for the songs.  Can't wait for her next CD.<br /><br />The best CD I've bought in a year.  Been playing it steadily in my car for the last 6 weeks.
B00008H2LB|4.0|1) Intro - doesn't count <br />2) Don't Stay - Great powerful bass and guitar. Catchy chorus 9/10 <br />3) Somewhere I belong - At first I didn't like this song because I don't like rap, and Linkin Park is always rapping, but the rapping fits in pretty well with this. Similar to Don't Stay, but I wish there was no rapping, ah well 7/10 <br />4) Lying from you - I LOVE the dramatic guitar introduction. Very heavy metal but it's great. Another rapping song, but I don't mind rapping too much if it's accompanied with guitars. A bit of screaming, but like I said before the guitars are BRILLIANT 9/10 <br />5) Hit the floor- Another dramatic heavy guitar introduction. Not such a good song. Too much rapping, then he just screams a bit too much for my liking. Also the music isn't very advanced, just a few noisy chords. Listen to it if you need some mindless music in your ear 6/10 <br />6) Easier to run - \\"It's easier, replacing this pain with something numb.\\" A great song, with minimal rapping, and we finally here how gentle his voice really can be. He doesn't scream half as much as well 9/10 <br />7) Faint - MY FAVOURITE SONG!!!!!! I really don't mind the rapping in this; it fits well with the BEST CHORUS EVER!!!!!!!! Sorry, but this is a fantastic track. The music is loud and faced past, and his chorus is quite upbeat, and you just can't help singing loudly and dancing around the living room to this song 11/10 <br />8) Figure 0.9 - This is similar to Faint but a bit slower. His whispering is really great in this song, even if it sounds like Faint. He doesn't really scream, but the guitars are slightly heavy. 9/10 <br />9) Breaking the habits - The one everyone knows. This has got great music. We finally get a break from the pulsating heavy guitars, and at last we can hear some gentler music. He varies his voice as well, so we don't here him screaming/bawling/grinding. His voice is gentle, and the music contrasts. Instead of the usual guitars/drums/bass, we here strings, guitars, bass, piano, and some sort of Chinese bells 10/10 <br />10) From the inside - More gentle singing, but still screams a bit, a bit of light rapping. Not very original music, but nice to listen to anyways 8/10 <br />11) Nobody's Listening - You know how I said I don't mind rapping if it's to a guitar background? Well he raps to a heavy r'n'b background, which kinda sucks. I've tried to like this song, but I can't stand it 1/10 for trying <br />12) Session - Just a musical, but not such an impressive one. It's a bit repetitive. It's a good song to listen to though, if you want to do something without getting distracted by words 7/10 <br />13) Numb - Another well known great classic. A mixture of gentle and hard singing, and gentle and hard music, with NO rapping whatsoever 10/10 <br /> <br />Overall, this is a really good CD. At first I didn't like it because I thought it was too heavy metal for me and too much rapping, but after a while it's grown to be one of my favourites, and surprisingly I listen to it to calm me down. A must buy for rock fans! <br />
B00005JKN9|3.0|The story was interesting but it was tough staying interested. Danile Day Lewis kept changing accents throughout the movie, not sure how this happened so quickly.
0143034901|2.0|This bloated Spanish novel boasts the most overwrought prose this side of a Harlequin romance in a mix of thriller, historical fiction, tragic romance, gothic horror, and most of all, soap opera. Set sixty years ago in postwar Barcelona, the story concerns teenage Daniel, whose discovery of an obscure novel is the catalyst for this sprawling adventure. That novel is \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" by a Julian Carax, a marginal exile writer who left Barcelona long ago to live in Paris, only to return later in life and die in murky circumstances. Daniel, the son of a widowed bookseller, becomes obsessed with the novel and its author, and so tries to track down more information about him. This leads him into the path of a mysterious disfigured man who is apparently tracking down and destroying every single copy of Carax's books. Meanwhile, there are a lot of other things going on, such as Daniel's coming of age into adulthood, his Romeo and Juliet romance, and persecution by an policeman who harbors some kind of grudge against Carax.<br /><br />This all sounds fine, but the novel so filled with problems it's hard to take seriously. First of all, the highly self-concious prose is atrocious-florid metaphor piled upon metaphor. Second, the characters are all fairly stock figures. Daniel is a plucky precocious teenager whose speech is witty and clever far beyond plausibility. His eventual mentor/sidekick Fermin is a figure of Falstaffian excess combined with encyclopedic knowledge, a heart of gold, and the wisdom of the ages. Women in the book are beauties, some virginal, some femme fatalesque, but above all, beautiful. The policeman is simply evil wrapped in a black trenchcoat. Thirdly, the atmosphere is a pretty standard film noir stuff -- people lurking in long shadows, narrow streets, curfews, the oppression of the Franco era. No true sense of Barcelona, not even for readers who've been there. Fourthly, some of the revelations that occur late in the story will hardly be as stunning as the author must have intended. In this kind of book, when there's any hint of mystery about a central character's death, they're probably not dead. Or if there's someone who wears a mask, it's a good bet that when that mask is pulled off, the most unlikely face will be revealed. Finally, the profusion of plot points make for an overcomplicated, overdetailed, and over-the-top story which rambles on for far too long.<br /><br />The author has clearly been influenced by the much better works of his countryman Arturo Perez-Revert&eacute;, but this reads like a comic book compared to Revert&eacute;'s engrossing and polished prose. Coming in at 500 pages, the book requires a significant commitment, but few will find it time well spent -- even those like me who enjoy historically-set mysteries.stunning as the author must have intended.

B00005JNBQ|4.0|I didn't really want to see Napoleon Dynamite, but had that sick curiosity reserved for rubbernecking on the freeway and reality television.  Then a friend let us borrow the DVD.<br /><br />Napoleon Dynamite is about, well, Napoleon Dynamite (Jon Heder), a tall, frizzy-haired, spectacled geek of enormous proportions.  Napoleon is a new breed of nerd: The Angry Nerd.  Because he's not short, Napoleon is a little too powerful to routinely pick on.  Instead, he's randomly slammed into lockers or mocked in gym.  But Napoleon never curls up into a ball and weeps. He tells people \\"SHUT UP! GOSH!\\" or \\"Freakin idiot!\\" through half-closed lids. Everyone knows the Angry Nerd...he's voted Most Likely to Be a Serial Killer by his graduating class.<br /><br />To be fair, Napoleon never had a chance.  We're never told where his parents are, but he lives with his ATV-riding grandmother (Sandy Martin) and his painfully awkward older brother Kip (Aaron Ruell).  Kip has a long distance relationship over the Internet with a woman known only as LaFawnduh (Shondrella Avery). Adding insult to injury, they own a pet llama named Tina and Napoleon has to take the bus to school with elementary kids.<br /><br />And oh yeah, his first name is Napoleon and his last name is Dynamite.<br /><br />Napoleon is also a gamer.  I submit the following evidence:<br /><br />Napoleon draws a manticore that he refers to as a liger. \\"It's pretty much my favorite animal,\\" says Napoleon. \\"It's like a lion and a tiger mixed... bred for its skills in magic.\\" When faced with a job putting chickens in cages, he asks, \\"Do the chickens have large talons?\\"<br /><br />Yep, that's a guy who plays Dungeons & Dragons all right.<br /><br />Or he would, if he had any friends.  Napoleon eventually makes one friend, Pedro (Efren Ramirez), who is also ostracized at school because he's from Mexico.  The so-white-its-bright faculty and students constantly look down Pedro upon.  But Pedro is confident in his own subtle way.  He asks girls out by baking them cakes and most importantly, he plans to run for school president.<br /><br />Napoleon is not so lucky.  He openly admits he has no skills (if this were a more up-to-date movie, Napoleon would say he has no \\"Mad Skillz\\"). Well, he has the ability to draw.  Unfortunately, he only THINKS he can draw.  His drawing sucks too.<br /><br />So Napoleon lies.  He lies about hunting wolverines, about his amazing martial arts prowess, about his non-existent girlfriend, about pretty much everything.  Since everything Napoleon says is utterly deadpan, there's no easy way to tell if he's lying.<br /><br />When Napoleon's grandmother has an ATV accident, his Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) comes to live with them.  There's a subtle irony here: Rico is a failed football star that is perpetually stuck in the 80s.  He is the ghost of the future, a vicious attack on all those high school jocks who would have gone pro if they hadn't messed up that knee.  Rico's entire life is driven by one goal: to travel backwards in time.  Once he discovers an expensive time travel kit on the Internet that will transport him backwards, he enlists Kip to join his get-rich-quick schemes.  First it's Tupperware, then it's...breast enhancement products.<br /><br />Yeah, Napoleon never had a chance.<br /><br />In the middle of this insanity, Napoleon bumps into Deb (Tina Majorino), dressed in full 80s attire and trying to sell her friendship bracelets so someone (her? Her mom?) can go to college.  It doesn't go well at first, but it's clear the two are destined for each other.<br /><br />Eventually, Kip meets LaFawnduh, a luscious African-American woman from Detroit.  Her arrival transforms Kip and the entire movie from then on, signaling a change from the 80s death by stagnation to an updated, hipper universe.  No literal time travel happens, but suddenly the movie shifts gears and its 2004 again.  And finally, all the characters begin some real emotional growth.<br /><br />Much of the movie's humor centers on the sympathy or disdain we have for characters like Napoleon.  A lot of the jokes are around mid-Western foils: the white town's reaction to an ethnic student, heavy usage of the word \\"sweet,\\" and farmers shooting cows (in front of a busload of schoolchildren no less). Not everyone will get the jokes.<br /><br />Perhaps more intriguing is the parallels between this film and Donnie Darko.  Both films have superhero-esque names, both take place in primarily white high schools, both feature racism against a different ethnicity, both have adults teaching kids confidence building skills, both have a serious 80s fetish, and finally both feature an obsession with time travel.  It's likely more people haven't made the connection between the two movies because few audiences have watched both.<br /><br />Unlike Donnie Darko, the broad parodies of white Midwesterners are smeared with racist undertones.  The two ethnic characters play to the most awful racial stereotypes: Pedro has a big family, scary relatives in pimped up cars, and is Catholic while LaFawnduh has long painted nails, lots of gold jewelry, and comes from Detroit.<br /><br />Throughout the film, the director (Jared Hess), makes liberal use of the buzzing sound of a fly.  It's a reminder that whenever we're laughing at Napoleon, we're the big jerks.  Which really argues the point that perhaps this movie isn't supposed to be a comedy after all.<br /><br />Ultimately, Napoleon Dynamite posits the question: what good ARE people like Napoleon?  He's angry, rude, insensitive, socially inept, and seems to be in a perpetual daze most of the time.  What ARE Napoleon's skills?<br /><br />We get the answer in a climactic frenzy of events that culminate in the class election. Pedro promises in his speech that he will make \\"all your dreams come true,\\" and in a sense, the film's conclusion is precisely that.<br /><br />Sweet!ional growth. <br /> <br />Much of the movie's humor centers on the sympathy or disdain we have for characters like Napoleon.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie was made out to be the funniest movie that any one has ever seen,when in actuality it was the most imature, senseless, plotless, dull movie I have ever seen. I actually sat through the entire movie thinking \\"hey, maybe it'll get better.\\" much to my demise it got worse, but I guess MTV can make teenagers these days believe anything is funny. In the words of Comicbook guy, \\"Worst Movie Ever!!!!!\\"
B0006957SA|5.0|When I first heard this album 17 (!) years ago, I was hooked. If you like rowdy music and dancing, you'll love the Pogues. I finally saw them in 1996 (minus Shane Mc) and it was still the best show I ever saw, though it took me a few days to recover. The title track, Bottle of Smoke, South Australia are great moshing tunes, but some of the most interesting songs for me include the instrumental Metropolitan and Fairytale of New York. I've been listening to this album for almost two decades and have never been bored. Not bad for something I bought totally by accident in 1988!
B000003CM8|5.0|if you like bluesy rock and roll, this is an awesome album by a truly unique band.  the musicianship alone is enough reason to get \\"the allman brothers band\\" cd.   buy it! buy it! BUY IT!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|The movie is wonderful.  The stage production is $145.00 and $175.00 a pop in Detroit.
B00005JMAH|5.0|The latest Harry Potter film installment stands head and shoulders above the other two. Cuaron sure had his work cut out for him -- a book far too long to bring to the screen without major editing. In the end he and the screenwriter captured the feel of the book and the most important plot elements without making the film feel too abreviated or lost. Yes half of the movie comes from the last fifth of the book, but that is the most important part of the book.<br /><br />The cast is, as before, tremendous, especially Emma Thompson, and I greatly enjoyed the cameo by Dawn French as the fat lady. I didn't even recognized Julie Christie. Michael Gambon is a wonderful replacement for the late Richard Harris.<br /><br />The whole atmosphere works and adds the right touches of a sinister feel. The color scheme, cinematography and art direction are all above the standard for this genre, but restrained and controlled as not to get in the way of the story telling. The director of Van Helsing could learn a lesson here.<br /><br />This film is far darker than the previous two, as is the book, so I would definitely not recommend this for viewing by SMALL children.  As Harry ages, SO DOES HIS AUDIENCE!!!  This is definitely a PG movie, and the next may very well be PG-13, and rightly so.  I think the books are.<br /><br />In the end, the film succeeds in what it intended and in what it NEEDED to accomplish. Here's hoping the future installments can be this well crafted and masterfully told, despite their prohibitive length.<br /><br />****1/2
0553571338|5.0|The Giver is a very good book that everyone should take the time to read. The way that the author, Lois Lowery, begins the story is excellent. You learn more and more as you read on and while the main character, Jonas, learns more. And it's not just a novel with a good plot. You get something out of reading this book. Jonas experiences life in a way different then everyone else in his town does. He's an outsider in a place where sameness is welcomed. The Giver also has good character development. You learn about Jonas even as he learns about himself. This book isn't just for young adults. Anyone of any age could read this and get something out of it. I read the book a few years back, I read it recently, and some of my opinions and thoughts about certain parts of the story have changed completely. I also noticed things this time that I didn't notice before. The Giver is definitely a book that everyone should read at some point in his or her life. It's never too late.
B0002KVUKM|3.0|but I didn't.<br /><br />It wasn't exactly boring or hopelessly lame, but it sure did have some glaring flaws. For one thing, the special effects often made the film feel cartoonish. In the post LOTR world of movie making, this is far less forgivable. The werewolves in the new Harry Potter movie are scarier and more \\"realistic\\" than the ones in Van Helsing. Dr. Jeckel looked more like a bad copy of the Hulk than anything menacing.<br /><br />The film certainly has its moments -- some good dialog/repartee and a good cast. The non SFX atmosphere works pretty well too. But all in all, I left the theater wanting more.  The anime versions of this story are far better.<br /><br />Decent but unremarkable. Would I see it again? Perhaps. Would I buy this DVD? Used...
B00005JN4O|4.0|Here's a scary revelation for you:  Evan \\"Average Joe Reviewer\\" Hinton is actually agreeing with the snooty movie critic community on one of those serious Oscar-worthy pictures.  Yes, usually I find the deep, emotional, dramatic films boring and dull; but, except for a minor bout of yawn-induction, \\"Finding Neverland\\" is an interesting and touching drama starring one of Hollywood's current superstars: Johnny Depp.<br /><br /> \\"Finding Neverland\\" is the (almost) entirely true story of how English playwright James Matthew Barrie was inspired to write his most famous play:  \\"Peter Pan\\".  Interestingly enough, it was originally scheduled to premiere last year, which would have been about the same time as the latest movie rendition of Barrie's famous play hit theaters.  Ultimately, \\"Peter Pan\\" didn't pan out (har!) too well, but at the time Columbia Pictures refused to allow Miramax to use portions of the play if the movies were released at the same time, so the film was held for a year.  \\"Finding Neverland\\" premiered in the larger cities months ago, but has recently gotten a lot of Oscar buzz, so our humble theater has begun showing it here.<br /><br /> As the story goes, J. M. Barrie (Johnny Depp) was inspired to create a story of children who didn't grow up by the Llewelyn Davies boys: George (Nick Roud), Jack (Joe Prospero), Michael (Luke Spill), and most significantly, Peter (Freddie Highmore).  He meets them in the park one day, and they become good friends and playmates.  Barrie uses his incredible imagination to entertain and enlighten the boys, all the while growing closer to their widowed mother, Sylvia (Kate Winslet).  Unfortunately, some of their romance stuff is pretty slow, and rather predictable, which weighs down the film and prevents it from getting a perfect rating.<br /><br /> This film is a bit like \\"Big Fish\\", with scenes of \\"reality\\" intercut with beautiful fantasy.  It's also reminiscent of \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", with moments in Barrie's life that obviously inspire aspects of the \\"Peter Pan\\" story.<br /><br /> Even though it is probably technically a \\"romance\\", \\"Finding Neverland\\" is an interesting tale of how a lasting work of theatrical and literary art is developed and created.  Writers definitely \\"write what they know\\".  This film gives us a glimpse at what the inside of a truly creative person's mind must look like:  images and feelings, wrapped together to form a seamless, wonderful tale.<br /><br /> Johnny Depp is excellent as J. M. Barrie.  His English accent is impeccable, and a different dialect than we heard in \\"Pirates of the Caribbean\\" (though he does slip briefly back into Jack Sparrow when he's playing \\"pirates\\" with the boys).<br /><br /> Perhaps what says the most about Depp's skills as an actor is that his next role will be that of zany Willie Wonka in the upcoming remake of \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", a abrupt departure from his sophisticated (but still good-humored) J. M. Barrie.ire aspects of the \\"Peter Pan\\" story. <br /> Even though it is probably technically a \\"romance\\", \\"Finding Neverland\\" is an interesting tale of how a lasting work of theatrical and literary art is developed and created.

B00005JNEI|3.0|Did you notice how many times Michael Moore says, \\"I wonder...\\" during his narration of Fahrenheit 9/11? This should tip you off that the film is mostly a montage of speculation and political rants with very little of what I would call journalistic substance behind it.<br /><br />I was disappointed by the film simply because it didn't do a good enough job. Taking cheap shots at Dubya may make those who hate him cheer, but it is not particularly compelling for those of us who might actually be trying to remain objective.<br /><br />This is basically the same stuff you'll find on Fox News or Rush Limbaugh, just spun in the other direction. Is that helpful?<br /><br />Post-election, this film loses much of its immediacy.  I agree that Dubya should be out of office, but I seriously doubt Moore's film will change many minds either way. If you already loathe Dubya, you'll love this film. If you support him, you'll end up hating Moore more!<br /><br />All the bomb throwing and conspiracy theory spinning reduce the power of his case, reducing it to a joke skit you might see on \\"The Daily Show\\" or \\"Saturday Night Live.\\" On that level it is fun, but again it lacks ultimate substance, and Jon Stewart does it better!<br /><br />It cannot be denied that there is plenty of fact-twisting and spinning here. I also found that there were NO \\"revelations\\" for me. I already knew all of these rumors and theories just by being a well-read citizen.<br /><br />I can only imagine that an uninformed viewer might come away thinking that the Bushes are the most corrupt politicians ever. Folks, the whole political system is corrupt...both parties. Politics breeds strange bedfellows and there is a whole lot of adultery going on. It's what Alexander Hamilton claimed made the system work.<br /><br />Yes, millions of Americans are angry with George W. Bush, and rightly so.  Michael Moore is livid, but I just wish he would have stayed his fomenting rage just long enough to create a work of serious journalism and not succomb to pedestrian muck-raking. ***k of serious journalism and not succomb to pedestrian muck-raking. ***

B000683VI4|5.0|Okay, let's admit it up front---this is a chick flick, unabashedly sentimental and designed to tug your heartstrings and keep Kleenex in business.  But as a guy, I found THE NOTEBOOK a remarkably well done and entertaining movie.  Based on Nicholas Sparks' hit novel, the story tells the familiar tale of two young people from opposite ends of the social scale who dare to fall in love.  Of course, parental interference, coupled with a World War, intervene and our lovers don't get together.  He becomes embittered but builds his dream house; she falls in love with a wounded soldier.  But as in any good romance novel, fate intervenes and our starcrossed lovers meet again.  Framed by sequences involving an elderly gentleman and an Alzheimer's stricken lady, we realize very soon that this elderly couple is our starcrossed lovers.  Despite its unrealistic ending, we do find ourselves engrossed in their love story and can't help but hold back a few tears at its sad, but understandably romantic, ending.<br /><br />What makes the movie work is a composite of remarkable acting and director Nick Cassavettes' embracing of the period costuming, and the gorgeous lighting and romantic sequences.  Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are wonderful in the roles of young Noah and Allie.  Consider that Gosling played the evil teen in MURDER BY NUMBERS and McAdams was the bitchy villainess in MEAN GIRLS and one can appreciate their multi-leveled performances.  The Academy should have found a supporting spot for both James Garner and Gena Rowlands, as they are great as the elder Noah and Allie.  Garner should have gotten Jamie Foxx's place for COLLATERAL, since its obvious Foxx has the best actor sewn up.  Oh, well, what the hey?  Garner is marvelous in a role that seems tailor-made for him, and Rowlands (who is the director's mom) is radiant and tragic.  Joan Allen as Allie's mother plays a rare despicable role, and even with a secret revelation, one cannot condone her interference in her daughter's life.  Add Sam Shepard in a nice role as Noah's father and you have one of the best love stories in recent years.  So sit back, enjoy and keep those hankies handy.'s life.

B0006SSOHC|4.0|This is a really cool movie. It's not just horror or just suspense; it combines a lot of the motifs in these genres to make for an entertaining ride. Critiquing this film is a lot like grading a poor student who you really like as a person. You know they dont deserve a good mark, but he/she is so darn fun and enjoyable, that you cheat yourself a bit. <br /> <br />This film has very good writing for the most part. Expect some funny dialogue and interesting special effects, along with decent acting and slightly better direction. Also expect to roll your eyes a few times in the film. But, the ending will make up for it. <br /> <br />I was really into the film until it came to that pivotal/climactic scene where the victim final gets away from her kidnapper, who has been torturing her, and has the gun in her hand, all she has to do is shoot, but what does she do?...she calls her husband. Yeah, doh! Giving the creep just enough time to attack her again. I mean doesn't this happen in every mediocre suspense film? Honestly now. <br /> <br />However, the ending of the film is so unexpected and fitting that it actually makes up for the mentioned flaw. <br /> <br />Overall, it's worth watching at least once. You'll never guess who the killer really is, and at the end you'll say \\"whoa!\\"   <br />

B0001KL5DA|5.0|If you haven't seen Season One, stop reading this right now and go watch it.  You're in for a real treat, as 6FU is one of the most well-written TV dramas ever.<br /><br />If you watched Season Two when it originally aired and are considering purchasing this set, you should know that the DVD extras are not plentiful.  Several of the 13 episodes have optional commentaries you can listen to while you're watching the episode; I find this is a big investment of time for a small payoff, but that's just me.  Plus, the last disc contains a short documentary \\"anatomy of a stiff,\\" which is worth watching once, but not really that compelling.  Another factor that might affect your purchase decision is that the episodes themselves are rich and stand up to repeated viewings, unlike most of the tripe on television.  Plus, watching the episodes on DVD - on YOUR schedule - makes for a much better experience than waiting a week or more between episodes as they are aired on HBO.<br /><br />If you've seen Season One but not Season Two yet, the best indicator of whether you'll like Two is how much you liked One.  Yes, it's true, fans disagree over which of the first two seasons was better.  But the overwhelming majority that liked One a lot also liked Two a lot.<br /><br />I think both of the first two seasons were EXCELLENT, but a bit different.  Almost every episode of the first season was very good or excellent.  The second season had the same average quality as the first season, but more variability - that is, a few episodes or storylines were a bit weaker than what we typically saw in Season One, but other episodes and storylines were even better than those in Season One.  The last two episodes of Season Two rank among the best television I've ever seen.<br /><br />I will try to set up the events of Season Two without giving anything away.  At the end of Season One, Nate was coming to grips with a newly diagnosed brain condition that could cause seizures, or even a stroke and death.  Nate and Brenda had declared their love for each other, despite a fairly complicated and sometimes rocky relationship.  David was single and struggling in his love life, and coming to terms with being \\"out.\\"  He and Keith were still friends, and it was clear that they still had feelings for each other.  These storylines are developed further in Season Two, with many interesting twists and turns along the way.  Of course, there are also storylines involving Ruth and Claire.  Ruth's growth in Season Two is nonlinear - she seems to make progress in one episode, but then reverts back to her depressed, repressed, controlling self in the next.  Claire has interesting relationships with different people, each of which shapes her in some way, good or bad, and she gets a bit of direction in her life toward the end of Season Two.<br /><br />One of the things that makes 6FU so great is that it's so real.  The characters are 3-dimensional, flawed, and (mostly) likeable.  Whenever I watch the show after not having seen it for a month or more, it's like getting together again with old friends.  I also respect the show for taking seriously the issues of religion and minority sexual orientation (Amazon.com has previously censored me for using the word that begins with \\"h\\").  Half of the main characters are religious, and their views are treated very respectfully.  One or two of the main characters are g__ (again trying to avoid the censor) and they are portrayed as real people, with the same joys and sorrows and problems as straight folks.<br /><br />Bottom line:  If you haven't seen 6FU season two yet, you are in for a real treat.  Be patient through the first two episodes, though, as their slightly lower quality is not representative of the rest of this outstanding season.declared their love for each other, despite a fairly complicated and sometimes rocky relationship.

B000683VI4|5.0|After hearing many positive reviews about The Notebook, I decided to see what the fuss was about.  During the first strains of the opening music, I found myself wondering if I was going to be able to watch the entire movie.  \\"This is going to be BORING...\\", I thought to myself.  But, I felt committed now that I'd paid the $3.95 to Blockbuster, so I was going to watch it whether I liked it or not. <br /> <br />However, as the plot unfolded, I found myself being pulled into the storyline subtly - identifying with Allie - not expecting to feel the emotions I felt when Allie had to choose between Noah and Lon.  The last few scenes were heart-wrenching and bittersweet and I was moved to tears.  I didn't want the story to end.  This story makes you want to go out and find that one GREAT love and live each day to the fullest with that special someone. <br /> <br />

B00008BRB5|4.0|By the seminal band of the eighties! Though this wasn't the album that got me INTERESTED in Sting and the Police, it was a decent eventualization of what they had been doing on \\"Zenyatta Mondatta\\" and \\"Ghost In The Machine\\" They had, by this time, just about completely chucked the reggae/calypso influence which had been a trademark of theirs on \\"Regatta De Blanc\\" and \\"Outlandos D'Amour\\". This was replaced by what would eventually become Sting's solo trademarks: political awareness, psychological speculation and observation, both inward and outward, and genre-hopping musical styles.<br /><br />The album title, \\"Synchronicity\\", is taken from a book by Carl Jung, discussing \\"interconnecting principals\\" and \\"cause and effect\\"...something which, oddly enough, doesn't really appear on the album itself, except on one song, but whatever floats Stingsy's boat, I guess....This is classic Sting... pretense with substance...(g)<br /><br />The songwriting, at least as far as Sting and Copeland are concerned on this album, is exceptional:<br /><br />1) \\"Synchronicity I\\": One of the two title tunes on the album, this is the ONLY song to deal with the title theme of the album itself. Though it sounds vaguely like a threat or a warning, (\\"You WILL know...Synchronicity!\\") and not just a glorification of the philosophy.<br /><br />2) \\"Walking In Your Footsteps\\": A rather corny tune, asking long dead dinosaurs whether they have \\"a lesson for us\\", comparing these behemoths to pacifist whales that were \\"three stories high, but wouldn't hurt a fly\\". Yeah, Gordon...say that to a stegosaur that's just been half devoured by good ol' Tyrannosaurus Rex!<br /><br />This is, however, the ONLY \\"cutesy\\" song on the album! Other themes are quite serious, like the next one, 3) \\"Oh My God!\\", a lament concerning the lack of concern the Almighty seems to have for Sting's character's life. One of my all-time favorite Sting lines is in this song: \\"Oh my God, you take the biscuit, treating me this way...expecting me to treat you well, no matter what you say! How CAN I turn the other cheek? It's black and bruised and torn...I've been waiting...since the day that I was born....FILLITUP! FILLITUP!! Fill it uuuup!\\"<br /><br />4) \\"Mother\\": Apparently, Andy Summers, who wrote this one, has BIG Tony Perkins issues...this song is VERY out of place on the album and suggests a \\"Psycho\\" element within Summers' mental makeup. It's best skipped, believe me!<br /><br />5) \\"Miss Gradenko\\": The only other song that could even remotely be described as \\"cutesy\\"...it seems to be about a teacher or office worker being confronted about how she feels or her conduct within the workplace...the \\"policy meeting\\" thing has me wondering just WHAT the song IS about, however. This is the one by Copeland.<br /><br />6) \\"Synchronicity II\\": The first archival tune you'll think of after listening to this song for about ten seconds will be one of the Monkees' better hits, \\"Pleasant Valley Sunday\\". Its main thrust seems to be the criticism of the bland, standard American/Western suburban lifestyle. However, there's a sub-stratum story warning of a mysterious entity rising from a \\"dark Scottish lake\\" that has you scratching your head throughout the tune!<br /><br />7) \\"Every Breath You Take\\": The ubiquitous top 40 hit that was eventually turned into a hip hop sample by the inimitable \\"P. Diddy\\", this is a song romaticizing obsession with one person, almost to the point of  stalking, for all I can see. But the tunesmithing is infectious and anybody who has been wronged, male or female,in a relationship, can readily identify with how the singer, (Sting,) feels.<br /><br />8) \\"King of Pain\\": I, entirely to myself, nicknamed Sting \\"The Little Pope\\" after hearing this and seeing the \\"EBYT\\" video. In this song, the very talented Mr. Sumner seems to be talking to God again, asking him why all the suffering and paradoxes are taking place around him. In it, he transfers his soul to a number of objects caught inimpossible traps or situations...(\\"...that's my soul up there!\\"), and after listening to all this, you have to say to yourself...that Sting is one COMPLEX dude! No question about it!<br /><br />9) \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\": A song telling the tale of a humble little fellow marking time as he waits to turn the tables on a well-situated superior of some sort...a mentor or a feudal landowner..who knows? But it DOES bring up some interesting visuals!<br /><br />10) \\"Tea In The Sahara\\": My personal favorite on the album...a song OBVIOUSLY inspired by the film \\"Dune\\", which Sting had been working on as he was also completing this album. The denouement of the song seems to almost parallel the tale of Paul and Jessica among the Fremen...\\"My sisters and I...have one wish before we die..and it may sound strange, as if our minds are deranged...Please don't ask us why...beneath the sheltering sky...we have this strange obsession...you have the means in your possession!\\" (Muau'Dib training the Fremen in the Bene Gesserit \\"weirding\\" way)....\\"The young man agreed...he would satisfy their need...so they danced for his pleasure...with a joy YOU COULD NOT MEASURE! (sietch orgy) Please wait for him dear (Chani)...the same place every year (Sietch Tabr)...Beneath the sheltering sky...across the desert he would fly...\\" Sound familiar? I can just see Muau'Dib and Stilgar riding the sandworm to Arrakeen as the imagery is conjured up....<br /><br />All in all, DEFINITE break with Police tradition, musically, as well as lyrically, as \\"Miss Gradenko\\", aside from ALMOST being \\"cutesy\\", ALSO is the only tune that sounds remotely Caribbean in flavor on the album.<br /><br />If you want a good example of the stage in the career of the Police where Sting pretty much turned into the artist he is now, this is the album to get...\\"Zenyatta\\" and \\"Ghost\\" would be more embryonic along those lines.<br /><br />Highly recommended!tening to all this, you have to say to yourself...that Sting is one COMPLEX dude!

1400032717|4.0|This is a great book that takes you out of your normal range and thinking and normal thought process and throws you head first into the world of Asberger's syndrome.  Some of us might tend to have some of these behaviors ourselves, but on a lesser scale.  I was able to enjoy this book and sometimes predict how the characters would react to certain situations.  I liked how the author did not downplay or adjust his writting to make us a little more comfortable with how this boy's life and thoughts are.  It was an awesome experience to walk in someone elses shoes without physically doing it.  That is a true sign of a great writer, when you are transported in mind to become the character.  Well put together and very informative.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Finally we have a concert DVD with decent video editing!None of that MTV cut-every-2-seconds garbage.(To be fair,Scenes from a Memory wasn't too bad about the video editing). The camera actually focuses on the band members long enough that you can see them do their thing.<br /><br />  And many times,as they're doing their thing,you'll find yourself shaking your head in disbelief and going wow.Especially during the many hyper-speed guitar solos that Jordan Rudess matches note-for-note on the keyboards. These guys are ridicuously good! And the 5.1 mix is fantasic for about the first 3/4 of the show. It's still good after that,but someone should have caught that before it got out. Much to my delight/chagrin, John Petruccis guitar is mixed dominant in the right rear speaker,every note comes through loud and clear. (Guitarist know exactly what I mean by the delight/chagrin comment;)<br /><br />  I know a lot of people complain about James LaBrie,but I've never really had a problem with his voice.At least he sings on key. He's more animated here than on previous releases,where it looked like he was just there to do his job. On this one,it sounds like he's getting vocally tired towards the end of the show.Then he coms back in full voice for the encore.<br /><br />  The extras are very good too.Especially the documentary and the multi-angle of \\"Instrumedley\\".<br /><br />  Unless your offended by instrumental profinciency, just get this!
0767821629|4.0|Why do so many reviewers compare this movie to the Matrix? <br />This movie is nothing at all like the Matrix. If you are ever in the video store and can't find anything good to pick up you might want to give this movie a try.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|Finally, this wonderful series is coming out in DVD.  I am still entertained by the episodes and am waiting for the next releases.  As a science teacher, I use some of Mac's innovations to stimulate discussion and interest with the students.  It is a great way to get their interest.  Especially for the price, this is truly a bargain.  Bring on the next years--I am ready for them.
B00008OSD3|1.0|This is certainly the worst of all the Trek films: I have no idea what they were thinking ($$?) when they made this one. <br /> <br />The plotline is illogical, unfocused, inconsistent, confusing and so poorly written that even some of the TNG season two stinkers (Samaritan Snare, anyone?) are more entertaining and satisfying to watch. Half the screen time you have no idea why the character is doing what it's doing. And the way they killed off Data was truly pathetic. <br /> <br />I cannot understand what would motivate the producers to make this movie. It has no sense of wonder that made Star Trek  great in Generations, First Contact or Undiscovered Country. Even Insurrection, though lame and laid-back, was true to the spirit of Trek - it was like an average season finale parts I and II combined. Nemesis plays like a cheap sci-fi B movie - avoid at all costs.
B000683VI4|5.0|Too bad my husband watched it with me. Otherwise, I would have bawled and bawled. Watched it last night, purchased it today.
B000089CJI|2.0|*Give Up* is very appealing the first few times one listens to it.  Much of the music is pretty good, but the album suffers from uneven lyrics, uninspired instrumentals and bad mastering.    Ben Gibbard's lyrics sometimes work very well, but frequently make me wince:  \\"I'm feeling green / like teenage lovers between the sheets.\\"    \\"Nothing Better,\\" starts with a neat line but then turns into a silly emo mess.  The vocals are a kind of annoying whiney monotone and have a emotionally vacant quality that matches the cheap synths a bit too well.    The most serious problem with this album is the production.  The tracks are insanely overcompressed, and there is almost no dynamic range or variation in the instrument levels.  The sound has no presence and the Game Boy/Casio keyboard synth loops get very old very fast.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|I love this song!!!  People were sitting in the theatre after viewing \\"The Wedding Date\\" just to see the credits to find out who was singing this amazing song \\"HOME\\"!!!

B0002IU988|4.0|This album is awesome. Many people I know aren't giving this album a chance, because they say 'It has members from Creed in it'. Boy, are they missing out. I always knew that there was more to Mark Tremonti's playing than what was showcased in Creed, and this album proves it. Plus, the songwriting is much better. It's amazing how much a guitar solo can make a song better. Also, the lyrics don't have the religious overtones that Creed's did.  <br /> <br />It's not n-metal, it's not grunge-rock, it's straight up Pure, no BS ROCK!!! <br /> <br />Best tracks - Find the Real, Open Your Eyes, Burn It Down, Metalingus, Broken Wings, Watch Your Words, The End Is Here. <br /> <br />Worst Track - In Loving Memory. From some interviews I have read, If he had the chance, Mark Tremonti wanted to redo this song. It is actually a tribute to his late mother, and he felt the song was kind of weak.
B00070Q7VO|3.0|This album seems tired. \\"Home\\" is the one fresh song, and has found a permanent place on my list of favorite songs of all time.     I adored his first, self-titled album. The vocal and instrumental quality of \\"It's Time\\" is equally high. And it isn't over-produced, as I feared might be the case with a David Foster project. But I don't often feel compelled to listen to the whole album. I can replay \\"Home\\" over and over again and never get tired. I respect the other songs, but they've already moved to my playlist just for parties or background music. A compliment to other activites, bit not special enough to be savoured on their own.       Looking forward to his next effort and hopefully some new territory.
B000059TEP|5.0|This is an offbeat and completely original love story, with some comedy, some drama, and a ghost story with elements of true pathos.  Some moments are genuinely heart-rending.  The viewer is immediately drawn into the story and remains riveted right to the end. <br /> <br />Patrick Swayze, Demi Moore and Whoopi Goldberg, (who won an Oscar for her performance,) are all perfectly cast.  They succeed admirably in bringing a rather unlikely story to life. <br /> <br />The movie was a popular success upon its release in 1990.  It hasn't lost a bit of its appeal in the intervening years. <br /> <br />This is a great movie, not to be missed! <br />

B0002F7I9Y|5.0|Ray Charles swept the Grammy's with awards for his music. Does anyone need a reason? Ray the one name is all we need to identify the man. He has been around as long as we can remember, and his voice is one of sentiment, tone, resonance and love. He loved every style of music, R&B, gospel, jazz, blues, soul, country and rock and roll. Every one of his memorable songs brings back of memories of the man and the times. We miss you Ray Charles, but this CD brings back some of the best of you.<br /><br />My favorite is his duet with Elton John- \\"Sorry Seems To Be The<br /><br />Hardest Word\\". There was a full orchestra behind this duo and it turned out to be the last song Ray Charles would record.<br /><br />His duet with Bonnie Raitt, \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind\\" is a bluesy rendition of this great song and how wonderful they are together. Bonnie's lilting smooth delivery of \\"Do you ever want to know what happened to me?\\" old lovers asking of each other.<br /><br />Norah Jones won a Grammy for this recording of \\"Here We Go Again\\". They both played the piano and bring out the best in each other- what brilliance in their voices as they slide into their rhythm.<br /><br />\\"Sweet Potato Pie\\" sung with James Taylor. They made such soulful, joyous music together.<br /><br />Diana Krall joins Ray for a rendition of \\"You Don't Know Me\\". Another song of loneliness and heartbreak that Ray does so well. The addition of Diana Krall's rich delivery provides a contrast to Ray's more gravelly portrayal.<br /><br />Ray joins Natalie Cole in the ever popular \\"Fever\\"- the funky jazz greatness.<br /><br />One of the best arrangements is that of Ray and Willie Nelson in \\"It Was A Very Good Year\\". A song sung solo by both of them, but oh, so much better as a duet. You can hear the weariness in Ray's voice, but the love of life is still there. They were the best of friends and now, alas, we have only Willie. Willie is the best there is and we need to keep him.<br /><br />Ray loved Michael McDonald's version of \\"Hey Girl\\". They have a full orchestra backing them, and this version of the 60's delight is one I will remember as my own.<br /><br />In a jam session, Ray and B.B. King belt out \\"Sinner's Prayer\\".<br /><br />Billy Preston joined them and the three friends made this song theirs to own.<br /><br />Gospel was one of Ray's favorites and he and Gladys Knight unite to sing \\"Heaven Help Us All\\" An influence of jazz and gospel in this old time religion sound.<br /><br />A dynamite recording with Johnny Mathis in \\"Over The Rainbow\\" is a smashing success. Two voices of the best generation.<br /><br />And, at long last Van Morrison and Ray Charles sing \\"Crazy Love\\".  Van Morrison requested that Ray induct him into \\"The Songwriters Hall of Fame\\", and then they sang. The crow went wild. Van Morrison, one of my favorite songwriters, singers of all time. How glorious to hear the two of them together.<br /><br />This is the best there is. We had Ray Charles for over sixty years, and now he is gone. Gone, but for the old clich&eacute; \\"Never Forgotten\\". Ray had a profound impact on us and on the performers who are represented in this CD. They were performed with a passion and uniqueness that was Ray Charles. Thank you, Ray for all the enjoyment you have brought to us. Unabashedly recommended to all. prisrob/>Ray loved Michael McDonald's version of \\"Hey Girl\\".

B0001UL7RY|4.0|UNDER MY SKIN....The title says it all. It's like her own diary in songs. These are not LET GO kind of songs but thought provoking. From the angry and sad NOBODY'S HOME to the super catchy MY HAPPY ENDING. This cd shows Avril in her mature state. From a girl who wanted to show the world that girls can be one of the guys to a girl who is a girl that goes through brake ups and sad events in life. A must  have for any AVRIL LSVIGNE fan and for those who are not AVRIL LAVIGNE fans this cd will show that she truly is a singer/songwriter. A GREAT PERFORMANCE! THOUGHT PROVOKING!
B00005JNPZ|4.0|When we discovered -Constantine- wasn't playing [a burned-put projector was blamed], m'hubby & i went to the next movie on, which turned out to be this likable if forgettable Will Smith vehicle.<br /><br />It really does little besides fill 90+ minutes.  Of course Will's an honorable 'date MD', who coaches shy guys on how to get their foot in the door, as it were.   Eva Mendes is equally sweet as the gossip columnist who's swept off her feet by Hitch, then ditches him when [she thinks] she finds out he's advising slimeballs.  [The 1 jerk implicated is man-handled by Smith for even  *suggesting* he wants Hitch's expertise to get a girl into the sleazoid's bed].<br /><br />& of course Love Trimphs Over All.  Like i said: a movie to see w/your date, while you're getting to know each other.  That's about it.
B00005JNPZ|3.0|This is about as non-offensive a film as you're ever likely to see, and Will Smith has such a sweet face that you can't help but smile when he is on screen. I recall Laurence Olivier's quip about Peter O'Toole's first film: \\"Had he been any prettier, they would have had to call it 'Florence of Arabia.'\\"  Well, it's kinda the same, without the overriding historical and spiritual dimensions. A chick flick? Yeah, especially given the fact that the audience I saw it among were predominately 14 year old girls and women my Mom's age. That's OK. Me and the missus got a few laughs out of it. And New York is never that clean, so what was left after paying Smith certainly went into sprucing up Soho.   There are a number of moments when Smith addresses the condescending white attitudes, but they are handled with a beguiling charm and strength that lands somewhere between Cary Grant and Pierce Brosnan. However, it was especially good to see a film that doesn't pander to a rose coloured picture of how we would like to get along. Watching the film and the mix of ethnicities, I was sure it must have been a Canadian film or shot in Toronto. What might come off as contrived in the US audience, Canadians have long gotten past.  I'd recommend the film for a harmless night out. It was worth the ticket price.
B000002L6P|3.0|This is Madonna's breakthrough album that came out in 1984 selling like over 18 million copies. I remember listening to Like A Virgin and becomming a fan right after. Its not the best song on the album but hey it was her second CD. I know Madonna does not like this song.     Material Girl is a  pop song about materialism and \\"if they dont give me proper credit, I'll just walk away\\", nice message.  She will forever be labeled as the Material Girl even though she has changed a lot and not that all into materialism anymore.  Angel is just another cute pop song.     Over and Over is my favorite fast song on the album. It has some  strong messages saying \\"if at first you dont succeed hears some advice that you should heed\\" meaning...\\"you get up again over and over\\". You keep doings things over and over even if you dont succeed at first. It is very danceable track and there is a amazing remix to it on the You Can Dance CD. The remix adds more life to the song with more sounds and is better than the original. This song may have been the starting point of Madonna transitioning into her more memorable fast songs from the True Blue album. But really who could forget Like A Virgin and Material Girl from the early 80's. I know I wont.    LDLHA is slow and dragged out song and I really do not like it.  Dress Up is fance song and the lyrics do not have too much of a deep meaning to it. A simple fast song with simple lyrics and it works.  Shoo-Bee-Doo has a great piano backing to it and the trumpet playing during the songs when Madonna is not singing. I like how she says \\"come here baby\\" . I dont like Stay or Pretender very much. They are not bad songs but they are the best either. Pretender has a great message I love about \\"I know all about your kind\\" meaning a guy whos been telling her lies and she acts like she doesn't know this but really does.  I recommend this CD for the songs Material Girl, Angel, Over and Over, and Dress Uo Up. This was Madonna's 2nd album so it was a great start.
0316172324|1.0|Having read recent articles written by Gladwell in the New Yorker, and having offered him the courtesy of access to information for the purposes of more objective reporting, and yet never hearing from him, it strikes me that the content of anything written by the author has to be taken as \\"for comedic purposes only\\". How anyone can consider Gladwell a serious author or innovative thought leader needs to complete more detailed research in to his writing. Blink proves to be ample additional proof that in future generations, when school children are reviewing the work of early 21st century writers, Gladwell's work will be used as an example of what NOT to aspire to...
B0006A9FMI|5.0|This may be hard to believe, but I can think of no anime/CGI film I've seen since Ghost in the Shell that has anything like the impact of Innoncence.  This is certainly one of the best of its kind.  Unfortunately, lacking the sexiness and high energy of Ghost, it has gone largely unnoticed.  I can only point out that the deep layering of not only the visual work, but music, dialog, and plot, demonstrate an almost infinite level of detail.  In many ways, this reflexion is what Mamoru Oshii was striving for - a film that challenges not only the viewer's definition of reality, but stretches the meaning of human beyond all comfortable boundaries.<br /><br />Three years have passed since Major Motoko Kusanagi entered the Net, leaving Batou, her partner, alone in a world where few have the mental cognates to understand what life as a 'ghost' really means.  A series of horrific killings spread across Tokyo.  Violent, arbitrary slayings by a new series of 'dolls' - robot toys for men.  Aramaki assigns Batou and Togusa to the investigation as partners.  Togusa is uncomfortable in this role because he is a full human. 'I have a daughter back at home,' he says.<br /><br />The story ranges from bloody crime scenes to a Yakuza showdown as Batou allows himself to be hunted in an effort to find the threads of the crime.  Lurking in the shadows are the manufacturers of the dolls, but Togusa and Batou must visit an eerie city that resembles a Hong Kong straight out of Bladerunner and a trip to a hacker's mansion where death, rebirth, and illusion are the stock in trade.  In the end it is not clear if they are searching for proof or for a deeper truth.<br /><br />The artwork and animation are so brilliant, and one can miss the a level of dialog where quotations from the Bible, Milton, and Japanese philosophers are commonplace, and Batou's interrogations are essays in the real subjects of the film.  The problem with dolls is not that, unlike the life they reflect, they can reach perfection.  The only thing that might spoil their mechanical grace and attention is the injection of a human consciousness.  Dolls, dogs, and children, director Oshii suggests, are our toys - made to imitate what we like best in ourselves.<br /><br />This is a dark film.  It frightens because the acts that open the layers if the case are unbound by human considerations.  Even when the motivations are good.  When Kusanagi's consciousness makes its appearances she can only offer Batou hope if he is willing to leave his human framework behind.  Only then can she be with him.<br /><br />Available only as subtitled Japanese, with a brilliant 'making of' and a full length commentary by Oshii as extras, this is still a DVD you will want to own.  Wherever you look there is more to seen, a brilliant script with interlocking references, and music that is a further refinement of what was done in Ghost in the Shell.  The more you watch it, the better it gets.hat might spoil their mechanical grace and attention is the injection of a human consciousness.

B000003BEV|3.0|Marc A. Vesci has no idea what he's talking about. Jagger admitted that this album was the stones attempt to combat Sgt. Peppers, he also admitted that they failed, and were taking too much acid anyway. <br /> <br />Having said that, I find amazing beauty all through this album, from the delicate She's a Rainbow to the mysterious 2000 Light Years and the plain groovy Citadel, this is well worth a listen, if only as a messy yet Nostalgic piece of psychadelia.
0441003257|5.0|This is one of the funniest books I've read since leaving my Douglas Adams novels at a friend's house. I laughed out loud at many points in the story, which I don't do very often. At others, I couldn't even do that - I had to rock back and forth, gasping and smacking the table.  <br /> <br />Crowley and Aziraphale are the representatives of hell and heaven, respectively. Crowley has to make sure that the Anti-Christ grows up to be the Anti-Christ. Aziraphale is also supposed to, because heaven wants celestial warfare. The problem is, they're both rather fond of the human race, not to mention this planet. But bad stuff's starting to happen - the four horsemen of the apocalypse are showing up (on motorcycles. And Pestilence retired. Pollution took his place.) and the seas are turning to blood. It's getting bad.  <br /> <br />It's also really funny, if you pay any attention to Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchett. Admittedly, the plot does drag a little in the middle (Adam the Anti-Christ and his friends are cute, yeah, but they're just not as good as Aziraphale and Crowley) but it's worth it. It really is. There are so many funny, little things in it (\\"Newt did not smoke, because he would not allow tobacco to enter the temple of his body, or rather, the Welsh tin tabernacle of his body...\\") that all the slow bits seem much faster. There are jokes about Welsh-Language television, New-Age spirituality, satanists, seventeenth-century English, fast food, diets, tabloids, and almost anything else you can think of.  I advise giving a copy to everyone you know.

The lime pound cake is simply terrible.  The cranberry cake is excellent.  The recipes remind me a lot of Martha Stewart recipes; they sound good but are not at all reliable.
B0006SSOHM|1.0|This was probably one of the most disappointing movies I've ever watched, especially with all the hype surrounding it.  My friends insisted that this was a horrifying movie, and they were right- just not in the way I expected. The only horrifying thing about this movie is the acting done by a tired and bloated looking Cary Elwes.  Past that, the movie just doesn't make any sense.  And so far as the plot twists that so impressed my friend, they're juvenile and easy to guess or just silly.  Wait for this one to come out on a premium cable channel and save your money.
B0006IIPIK|3.0|I skipped seeing this movie at the theatre because it just didn't seem good enough for me to spend $20 on tickets and concessions, and I'm glad I did.  I really did want to like this movie.  I enjoyed the story idea, the technological \\"wow\\" factor, the homage to 1940s serials; but the wooden acting and hackneyed plot just brought the movie down.  Yeah, the whole technological razzle dazzle was a sight to behold, but too many times you could tell that the actors were standing in front of fake scenery and each time I saw Gwyneth Paltrow attempt to run around in those heels, I just had to chuckle; I mean, she looked more like she was running in place!  There are certainly some great moments in the film:  the arial battles, the 1940s look, and the inclusion of an actor who's been dead for more than 15 years.  Overall, it just wasn't enough to rate higher than three starts.  There is definately potential here and I hope the fact that the movie was a major flop in the theatres won't deter Conran or others like him from trying this again.  Just get a better story and work out some of the kinks.
6305558167|5.0|This movie is by far the best on-screen adaptation of the legend that there is. The dark mood evoked by the clever use of eerie lighting, brilliantly timed scores by Wagner and Carl Orff, and the extraordinary cast brings so much truth and feeling to this film. It's been one of my all-time favourites for as long as I can remember, and I think it's got the potential to capture even today's new audience.
0790742780|4.0|Arguably Michael Douglas's best acting performance in this gritty, urban \\"everyman's\\" tale of reaching the breaking point...and then some.  Compelling direction told in near \\"real time,\\" with one of the best, most diverse and talented supporting casts ever assembled.<br /><br />The big disappointment with this DVD is the non existence of any special features!  That is the only reason I didn't give it a 5 Star Review.  Douglas, Hershey, Duvall...Writer, Director, Casting Director...all would have been compelling commentators!
034544678X|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It is a book on dog behavior, and provides only a few actual training tips.  However, the author gives many very interesting anecdotes from her own experiences, which she uses to illustrate her points.  It is a quick and easy read.  All dog owners should read this book, especially if they are experiencing behavioral issues with their dogs.

B0000013G9|5.0|When Lisa 'Left Eye' Lopes died in 2002 I thought it was about time I invested in a TLC album. I had always liked the band's music in the past but wasn't sure if I would like an entire album of material. I felt this way for a few years until I saw \\"CrazySexyCool\\" on sale over Christmas 2003. I bought it straight away and for a few months didn't listen to it much at all. You can only listen to so much music, and Bjork was currently taking up all my air time. However, when I really started playing this album in 2004 I realised just how funky and important a record it actually is.<br /><br />Released in 1994, this was the album which made TLC the R'n'B legends they are today. It sold more than 10 million copies in America alone! For a solely R'n'B band, that is absolutely incredible. Even Destiny's Child haven't managed to sell that much of one album. So why did this record sell so much? I believe it was down to the incredible music on the album and the way in which TLC's style transcended musical boundaries. They came up with the hit singles which everyone loved and could identify with. It wasn't just R'n'B lovers who were buying this album, in other words. Other successful examples of records that have transcended their musical boundaries from the Nineties are Shania Twain's \\"Come On Over\\" and Alanis Morissette's \\"Jagged Little Pill,\\" both with mammoth sales of 20 million and 16 million respectively in America alone.<br /><br />The album opens with the fabulous \\"Intro-lude\\" which is just over one minute long but could perfectly stand as a song in its own right if it were a few minutes longer. The album title is whispered over and over to get you in the mood for the themes of the album. This leads us into the funky \\"Creep,\\" which was one of TLC's biggest ever hits. The girls sing about creeping out of the house to meet up with other guys, while their boyfriend's are at home. The reason for this? Because they know their boyfriends are doing exactly the same to them. Superb slick song about female empowerment. \\"Kick Your Game\\" is a very sharp and tight song with great beats and an undeniable groove. Lisa's raps are great and also rather funny. \\"Diggin' On You\\" has to be one of the flyest songs I've ever heard! The vocals of all three girls are amazing on this song and the beat is really soulful. This is one of those summer time anthems that you can just relax to, especially with the lyrics, \\"I was like peace, in a groove, on a Sunday afternoon.\\"<br /><br />\\"Case Of The Fake People\\" has a slamming beat which really draws you in. It's a very classy song where the girls talk about the fakeness of the industry. The chorus is very catchy and you can sing along to it so well. \\"CrazySexyCool - Interlude\\" picks up where the intro left off, but I always tend to skip this. \\"Red Light Special\\" is where the girls get really sexy with lyrics which will melt your earphones! They sing of entertaining their man without any shame of feeling dirty or degraded. They are, indeed, the one's in control and it's much classier than say Janet's \\"Would You Mind\\" or \\"Moist.\\" Then of course we have the masterpiece of the record in the form of the classic \\"Waterfalls.\\" In stark contrast to the sexy feeling of the last song, this song has a very serious message about life on the whole. The video is absolutely amazing because of the messages it puts across, and it tells you straight away not to get into deep water if you don't know what you're doing. The waterfalls obviously represent the downfall of each particular person as the girls warn, \\"Don't go chasin' waterfalls.\\" This song always sends chills down my spine because it's so poignant but also very peppy because of the instruments used. This juxtaposition is what makes it chilling. A classic song that will stand the test of time.<br /><br />\\"Intermission-lude\\" is another boring interlude followed by the superb \\"Let's Do It Again.\\" This song is similar to Diggin' On You but a bit lighter and I think Chillireally gets to show off her vocals here. \\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\\" is a great song which turns the pace of the album right around. The beat is dark and almost intimidating, and I'm sure Beyonce sampled this on her duet with Jay-Z's \\"Bonnie & Clyde '03.\\" Another interlude follows in the form of \\"Sexy - Interlude\\" which is rather dirty and funny at the same time! \\"Take Our Time\\" is a slower song with a sexy beat, although it's not really one of my favourites. \\"Can I Get A Witness - Interlude\\" continues the theme of the first few interludes on the album and features Busta Rhymes. \\"Switch\\" is a rather funky song with a bit of an old-skool feel to it. It's not really one of my favourites though. The album closes with \\"Somethin' Wicked This Way Comes\\" which ends the album on a fine note. There's a real message in this song and Andre 3000's raps are also rather interesting.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />In the end I'd have to say that this is one of my favourite R'n'B albums ever. It's not the best I've ever heard, but I can see exactly why it sold so many copies. This was definitely one of the best albums of the Nineties and deserves a place in anybody's collection. The album is mainly focused on love, but always has a song which contrasts this about cheating men. The album juggles the highlights and lowlights of a relationship, and also has a few strong political messages. This in itself commands respect. The Spice Girls might have taken over the entire universe, but TLC were always more critically-acclaimed.als here. \\"If I Was Your Girlfriend\\" is a great song which turns the pace of the album right around.

B00004W510|5.0|No argument. This is among the all-time great albums of the rock era. <br />    The problem comes from the conflict between Robbie Roberston and (mainly) Levon Helm. <br />    Most people are familiar with the argument, but basically it is that Robertson takes an inordinately large amount of credit for the music of The Band. There are supporters on both sides of the argument, but the fact that Helm insists it was much more collaborative among them all appeals to me and he offers compelling arguments in his book, \\"This Wheel's On Fire.\\" <br />    In the liner notes to \\"The Band\\" the only member represented is Robertson whose statements are all \\"I\\" statements. Things begin to sound implausible when he talks about doing historical research before writing, by himself, \\"Dixie.\\" He goes further on saying that Helm's contribution to that song was to provide a \\"cracker\\" perspective which enabled Robertson to write the lyrics more authentically. <br />    When we look at the incredible scope and imagination put into The Band's music and lyrics (and that did not fully disappear with Robertson's exit) and compare it to Robertson's mediocre solo work, Helm's argument for collaboration gets a boost. <br />    So, how did Robertson get his name all ove the writing credits? According to Helm he was the more business and studio saavy among them, and the rest of them didn't take things seriously enough to worry about it. <br />    Clearly Robertson was a significant component of The Band. Unfortunately, he seems to want to promote himself at the expense of the others and the folks at Capitol are happy with that. <br />    My advice is to listen to the music and don't read the notes. The music is sincere.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This is the type of movie (for me atleast) that is the stupidest thing in the world until the day after you see it, and then it's hillarious! Watch this movie but don't make any judgements on it until you've had time to think about it! The characters are all very loveable, Deb being extremely shy, Pedro with his simlple one word replies, and ofcourse Napoleon himself who is so nerdy he's cool! (does that make sense? lol) n e ways, go out and get this! it's worth it!
B00005Q4CS|4.0|Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream is strangely captivating. After watching it the first time, I decided to never watch it again because of its raw darkness. The next day I was watching it again.  <br />The characters are likeable, but their lives are destroyed by their choices. It is painful to watch the characters go farther and farther down into their nightmarish lows.  <br />However, everyone should watch Requiem for a Dream because of its honest portrayal of drug use. Some aspects of the movie are incredible, like the artistic qualities of the film, the acting ability, and how easy the story is to relate to.  <br />Other aspects of Requiem for a Dream were annoying, but easily forgiven. The movie has a loose plot because the story is about observing the spiraling downfall of the character's lives. The filmmaking style can become aggravating because of how repetitive it is. And I had a quirky problem with trying to start the DVD, because an infomercial plays when I press the `play movie' button. I had to start the movie through `scene selection'.  <br />
B0006HXXBA|5.0|I love this album. If Violent Revolution was the Endless Pain for the new millenium, this is definitely the Pleasure To Kill for the new millenium. After a 4 year hiatus, Kreator release their strongest album in years. Mille Petrozza's vocals are as great as ever. The album starts with the title track, which has a great guitar riff and great drumming. The next song, Impossible Brutality, is another favorite. I think it's about the Holocaust (\\"All I see is terror/All I see is pain/All I see is mothers/Dragging children to their graves\\"). Other great songs include Suicide Terrorist, World Anarchy, Dying Race Apocalypse, and Under A Total Blackend Sky. The best song on this album, however, is Ancient Plague. That song ALONE is worth purchasing this album. All the songs on this album are good, but the above mentoned are my favorites. Hail Mille Petrozza, and hail Kreator. Buy today or continue posing.

B0009KA7BS|1.0|Very bad Keanu Reeves horror film is a real look at how much a vanity project can spiral out of control. Keanu Reeves is just out of place in supernatural tale about a private eye that helps a cop look into the suicide of her twin sister. The special effects are not of top quality and the script is too jumbled to even try to figure out what is going on from time to time. The rest of the acting is decent with Rachel Weisz stealing the show and giving this movie more than her fair share of heart and talent and Peter Stormare doing more in his brief cameo that most of the other actors in the film. Unfortunately nether Weisz or Stormare can over come the hack like script which treats their characters and the story of the film as a joke. I like a good popcorn film but this is not one of them.  <br />
0767830555|4.0|Well, the movie is always gone at the BlockBuster next to my house, so I figured I would buy it. I was very hesitant at first because of the \\"NOT was it was said to be.\\" - \\"It's to slow.\\" - \\"Only emotion you'll find in this movie is bordum.\\" comments. It was none of the above. This movie doesn't appeal to most because it doesn't have people firing guns left and right. The context of the movie is what makes it a 'classic'. I highly suggest atleast renting the movie. If you can't rent it, I would suggest buying it. Yes, it's that good. Whatever though, each to his own, I guess.
B0007CY2RI|3.0|This film has a few comic moments but it  has a very dark theme that in no way relates to a normal coming of age film.  It is powerful and is a work of art but the director makes his mark on us by crossing many lines, making a film that frankly could not be shown in any public theater I know of.  It is a work of despair.  Heavy use of symbols to code whether something is actual or imagined.  The main theme is the harm done to childhood both by the social environment and by genetic and abuse-caused brain damage.  There are scenes of both child and animal abuse.    This is the second and last film from this director, who died in a small plane crash soon after this film was finished.
0425166805|1.0|I was about to write a review when I discovered one that said everything I wanted to say, except to note that Erich was a fraudster and convicted embezzler, and reprinted it below.   <br /> <br />- Primitive savages (i.e. non-Europeans) weren't intelligent enough to create these monuments, and their own great civilizations for that matter, all on their own. Thus, those outside influences that created these civilizations MUST have been aliens who, coincidently, looked much like Europeans. - <br /> <br />It's not difficult to counter Von Daniken's claims. From a scientific standpoint, he has a theory and twists \\"evidence\\" to support it; evidence that would counter his hypotheses is conveniently ignored. In fact, he rarely uses any evidence at all. He merely dismisses the accepted ideas out of hand, and then floats his own ideas as if these constituted evidence itself. When he did try to present physical evidence, as he did with pottery depicting flying saucers, these were proven to be frauds (\\"Nova\\" found the potter and Von Daniken had to admit the fraud he perpetrated when confronted). This, boys and girls, ain't science. <br /> <br />I'm torn in rating this book. On the one hand, I found myself laughing a great deal, so in that respect it provided me with a great deal of entertainment. However, it has also contibuted to a lack of scientific understanding of many people today. There are those who accept it without question, and I find this fact scary as hell. <br /> <br />Here, here. <br /> <br />
0440238609|5.0|these i would say are the greatest books ever. from the first page right until the last, they touch on so much. from the growing up of children, the church and life in itself. it rivits you into it and you cannot let go. the most memorable book. Pullman has used incredible skill in creating a whole other world where the events happen.it leaves you with such emotion, a book like no other.  if you haven't read these books DO SO NOW!
B0000027RL|5.0|Before I ever knew of a band called Pearl Jam I picked this CD up in my music shopping spree 3 years ago and I was very surprised by this band. This is Pearl Jam's first release back in 1991 and since this album I have started collecting their other albums. This album is richly deserving of the praise and adoration by fans and music buffs for it is a great CD with 11 helluva rock'n'roll groove.<br /><br />The songs 'Once', 'Even Flow' and 'Alive' set the pace and the band's direction all at once. Since this album Eddie Vedder and his merry band has gone from strength to strength with hits and album successes every year since 1992. Two of my all time favourite PJ songs are on this very album and they are 'Black' and 'Jeremy'. Vedder has the voice to pull off the changes in vocals needed in this unique CD.<br /><br />And the last song 'Release' is a craftily made song to lull people back for more and more of a dose of Pearl Jam. Yeah baby!
B0006399FS|1.0|We are U2 fans as well, but we just dislike this (...), thats all. Must a U2 fan love every corporate plastic radio-friendly ordinary product credited as \\"U2\\"? I dont think so. Im a Radiohead fan as well, but I hate Pablo Honey, that means Im a Radiohead hater and a Korn fan? No way.    The same thing happen here, despite Im a die hard U2 fan, I simply dislike this recycled cheap (...). When you say \\"I programmed that track order in iTunes and it's really good!!!\\" you just show your emptyness as critic fan, I mean, every real U2 fan just hate that sellout move!!!. Just read older reviews here.    And you say \\"I'm not part of U2's marketing team and I really love this CD. It's so sad to read so many negative reviews of this CD. It reminds me of when Pop came out and the same happened and now, generally, people consider Pop a great CD\\", but let me remind you thats not true at all, unlike what some younger U2 fans - whom usually love ATYCLB and hate Zooropa and Pop - think. Pop was so acclaimed at that time. By the end of Pop Mart Tour Pop became a so so reviewed album. Pop was actually poorly rated by the time ATYCLB was released, I mean, they sold out and they promised \\"A return to our roots\\" late 1999 so everybody was happy for that and negative reviews increased, as fans were expecting for another Joshua Tree.      Dont forget the hype theyve got since ATYCLB. Thats include their well-known supporting magazine Rolling Stone, Grammy Awards, MTV, NME, Time magazine, Billboard, etc. The mass media must be down on knees for them, because they have the money therefore everyone must follow their rules. Usualy Rolling Stone rate every new U2 album with 5 stars, but then they down it to 4, after realising fans dont think the album is as good as they say.     Its not secret this mainstream (...) was made purely for the money they can get from easy fans like you. I bet you that you were one of those fans who have nothing else to do that waiting outside the music store by the release day, dont even listening to it before, people like you just want to say among fans \\"I was the first one in buying the new U2 album!!!\\"...    If I were U2, I had no intention of touring this disliked dull album. As one might expect, this album hit #1 on the charts quite easily, but in my opinion, that is merely another example of the fact that people, as a whole, sometimes are idiots.     The album itself is unforgivable. It sounds canned. Selling out as it's most obnoxious. Weak songs, cliche lyrics, emtpy music borrowed from ATYCLB, etc. \\"Sometimes\\" gets my vote as one of the worst U2 songs ever. \\"Original of Species\\", \\"Love And Peace Or Else\\" and \\"A Man And A Woman\\" instantly sound dated and unlistenable. All that plus lame sissie production. There is a definite decrease in artistry that nobody can deny (songwriting, solidity, and overall impact) compared to U2s best albums - Acthung Baby, Joshua Tree, War, Pop, Zooropa and Unforgettable Fire.    It's very soothing and has a nice tragic feel to it. In fact the album has the same ATYCLB sound to it, even considering the stupid army of asleep producers and U2s idiocy to label this a \\"U2\\" record.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I purchased this album three months after purchasing Ten. Many people who have reviewed this album don't like it and yet I can't see why not. 'Binaural' has some very cool songs on it with one of my favourite songs 'Evacuation' and followed by 'Thin Air'.<br /><br />Okay granted some of the songs are below par but heck the good definitely outways the bad. 'Breakerfall' is a good song, although short for a opener for this album. This album should be given another chance by fans, it is a album that you have to listen to more than once to fully appreciate.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Not often do you run into a movie like \\"Before Sunset\\". I decided to give it a shot after being floored by its first part, shot nine years before, \\"Before Sunrise\\". Today, I confess my admiration for what director Richard Linklater, along with Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy accomplished.<br /><br />Hawke and Delpy meet again during the last stop of his book tour in Europe, when she drops by the bookstore where he's giving a press conference. After that, they have about an hour to catch up where they left things at nine years before, when they said goodbye (at the end of \\"Before Sunrise\\") in a Vienna train station.<br /><br />This movie is close to perfection in many ways. The dialogs are fascinating: far from conventional, very deep and still romantic in many ways. The timeline (80 minutes) is almost in real-time (having been shot in a little over two weeks, after another two weeks of rehearsal), which makes some scenes admirable from all points of view: some approach the demands of theatrical work. The music, a bit more inconspicuous than in the first one, is still fantastic.<br /><br />Overall, this one, with its 1995 counterpart, are bound to become all-time classics. At least for me, there are spaces saved on my small collection of movies for them.
B0001EBXBK|5.0|In my honest opinion, this movie surpasses The Matrix by a long shot. This movie was made so well, and Tarantino added this awesome style to the movie, it's simply stunning. It has just about everything, humour, martial arts, great dialogue, very very very fake blood thats spurts out in fountains, and an awesome supporting cast of unforgettable characters.<br />Four years after the massacre at her wedding, the Bride awakes from her coma and seeks revenge on the 5 people who did this to her.<br />The cast is played very well by everyone. Uma Thurman truly shines, and the supporting cast is also very good: Budd (Michael Madsen), Oren-Ishii (Lucy Liu), Vernita Green (Vivica A. Fox), Elle Driver (Daryl Hannah), and of course, you can't forget the big man himself, Bill played by David Carradine (voice). Other well done roles include the girl who plays GoGo Yubari and Hattori Hanzo (Sonny Chiba?)Every role in the film is very well done.<br />If you don't mind A LOT of blood and lots of violence, this movie    <BR>must be seen. It will take your breath away.

B000660UN0|5.0|\\"Sessions For Robert J\\" is amazing, and in my opinion, a clear winner over the also-extraordinary \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\".  The CD contains several new covers of Johnson songs on his \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" album such as \\"Milkcow's Calf Blues,\\" \\"If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day,\\" and \\"Me and the Devil Blues\\".  It also includes a few other Johnson covers not on the album such as the amazing \\"Sweet Home Chicago,\\" \\"From Four Until Late,\\" and a new acoustic cover of \\"Ramblin' On My Mind,\\" which he originally covered in 1965 with John Mayall's Bluesbreakers. <br /> <br />The sessions for several of these songs can be seen on the DVD, including sessions for songs not on the CD.  The DVD also contains intervals with interviews with Clapton, touching on his love of Robert Johnson and his roots as well as a few interesting facts about Johnson's mysterious history.  The interviews, the stories, the songs, and the videos all make \\"Sessions For Robert J\\" and obvious choice for any Eric Clapton fan. You won't be the least bit disappointed.
B000003TA4|5.0|Folks can quote Schopenhauer & say Kurt was ignorant or, OTOH, call him the early '90s rock messiah but the plain truth is . . . they're both wrong. Nirvana needs to be understood in the context of the Seattle music scene of the time. The best way to get a handle on that is to watch the documentary Hype! & realize that the Seattle scene was an excellerated microcosm of the rest of the country. Because of that, its bands evolved in a way that was unlike any other major city's scene in the US or UK. Collectively, those bands - Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Screaming Trees, The Posies, Soundgarden, Mudhoney, etc (&, yes, even Tad!) - affected the the direction of popular music so dramatically that it practically changed overnight. I remember vividly the first time I heard Nirvana's Sliver on a local college radio station driving home from work one Los Angeles evening in 1981. It was so vastly different from  everything else being played at the time that I 'bout had to pull off the freeway! But that uniqueness was not owned by Nirvana. Kurt, like the rest of the artists from the Seattle scene, never wanted big fame or to be rock & roll heroes; they just wanted to play their music on their terms. By the time the rest of the world discovered what was happening there, the scene was already changing. (Read what Michael Stipe has to say about the direction Kurt's music was going at the time of his death.) <br /> <br />By the time it hit the mainstream, Grunge was already dead. Those who say it was about any one specific band weren't paying attention. It was about the scene itself. And once it got out to the masses - who almost universally misunderstood it - and the sound was appropriated by bands like Stone Temple Pilots, the originators lost interest. Notice how the sounds of bands like Soundgarden, Pearl Jam, & The Posies had radically changed by 1994 & their peers had dropped off the charts. Same thing happened in the early '80s with REM, U2, The Clash, etc. Same thing happened with the Beatles & the Beach Boys. <br /> <br />It's so easy to write a hagiographic piece about a guy who was the antithesis of the New Kids on the Block & easier to vilify him. But the truth of the matter is, most folks tend to view Nirvana in 20/20 rose-colored hindsight. Remember folks, the Beatles' stuff can sound trite in light of their imitators, too. But let's be honest & remember who did what first. And admit that it was never really about Nirvana & Nirvana alone. Just as it was for the '70s punk bands, it was about all the bands of the Seattle scene, their music, & the opportunity to play it. And when I hear a band like Nickel Creek drop part of Lithium into the middle of one of their bluegrass numbers - & rock the varnish offa their instruments! - I know that the Seattle ethic is alive & well in the musicians of today who were influenced by Kurt 15 years ago. <br /> <br />\\"Rock is dead. Long live rock.\\" <br />Pete Townsend
B00005MK9Y|5.0|\\"Babylon By Bus\\" captures Bob Marley & the Wailers in the middle of the European leg of the \\"Kaya\\" World Tour in 1978.  The album shows the band performing with amazing, spellbinding energy.  Nearly every hit from the Marley repertoire up to that point in his career is here from \\"Stir It Up\\" to \\"Is This Love\\".  This shows Marley near the height of his career, having become a musical icon all over the world as he thrust reggae into the mainstream of music just two years earlier with \\"Rastaman Vibration\\". <br /> <br />The best song on the album is the closing track, \\"Jamming,\\" with a stellar guitar solo.  Also outstanding with an even more impressive guitar solo is \\"Heathen\\".  This album is phenomenal, and in my opinion, a great addition to, and better than 1975's \\"Live!\\" album.  If you buy this, you won't be disappointed in the least.
B00005JN0T|5.0|This is the best Sci-Fi film since the Matrix!!! It was very real and the effects were amazing. This movie is PERFECT for anyone who enjoyed A.I.
B0001HAHXW|5.0|\\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\" shows Eric Clapton going back to his roots, to his inspiration, the bluesman Robert Johnson.  On this album, Clapton covers 14 of his hero's legendary songs like \\"Me and the Devil Blues,\\" \\"If I Had Possession Over Judgement Day,\\" \\"Milkcow's Calf Blues,\\" \\"Traveling Riverside Blues,\\" and my personal favorite, \\"They're Red Hot\\". <br /> <br />This album is about pure, heartfelt blues.  It's Clapton's labor of love to the man who inspired him to such great heights throughout his entire career.  Clapton pulls off the sound excellently, with down-home piano-playing and his own personal excellent guitar work that's made him known as one of Rock & Rolls greatest guitarist.  Any Clapton fan will not be disappointed.  This his best work in years.  Well done, Mr. Clapton.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|This movie has got to be the best film of Ashton Cutcher's career! (OK that does'nt say much but I have to give him props to a great screen performance for this one!!).   <br /> <br />I watched this movie not expecting much, but it ended up being a film that actually made me think philosophically about life and those \\"what if\\" possibilities. Although the film is at times can be a bit poor, it was overall a great film! I thuroughly enoyed this movie and I liked that fact that it had a lot of dark irony it and is'nt a \\"happy go lucky\\"-type film. So many people wrote bad reviews because they can't handle this type of film.  If you can't handle a dark, some what demented film than go see Independence Day or something....  <br />I would definitely watch this one again... if you liked Donnie Darko, American Psycho, Punch Drunk Love, you would probably
B0006399FS|1.0|Well here we are at U2's last official studio album -I hope so- and what a disappointment it is. Really there is nothing that screams out innovation and song quality here. Even the name 'U2' seems to lack the whole quality after this lame attempt at radio-hit album. <br /> <br />Most songs of this unoriginal remake album are almost impossible to differentiate from each other and, indeed, just come across as three reprisals of the same song. And it gets worse. \\"Vertigo\\" was released as a promotional single for this pitiful album which I find singularly incredible given it is one of the very worst songs I've ever heard recorded by a major artist (let alone a band as great as U2). Again, it is a ham-fisted rockabilly number that is simply beyond redemption and, listening to it, one marvels as to how any band could be short-sighted enough to write it, let alone include it on an official album, LET ALONE release it as a single. Can you imagine the embarrassment of hearing that in the chart countdown alongside the likes of Green Day, Franz Ferdinand, The Cure, etc?. <br /> <br />'Love And Peace Or Else' is an offensively poor rockabilly cut that is simply terrible. F.I.L.L.E.R. 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own' is stupid beyond belief with Bono stuttering old cliches and the band sounding similarly out-dated. Still, with 'All Because Of You' they sound like they're having fun, a bit like your middle-age relatives embarrassing themselves at weddings dancing to the likes of \\"Twist and Shout\\".  <br /> <br />Let's not get too cynical. The whole album is an obvious outtakes collection from All That You Can't Leave Behind. U2 are now another dinosaur band trying to make a ton of money by releasing bland radio rock for secretaries and investment bankers and A&R men with ponytails. This s**t is supposed to be like some kind of updated 1980's U2 and yet it comes off as more contrived and outdated than anything else they've done.  <br /> <br />
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I liked this movie more then most people did, but not enough to give it 5 stars....I think 3.5 stars would be more like it. I watched it a few times since it came out and I'm sure I'll watch it again and again. I liked the music, I liked the acting (although there was nothing special about Bill Murray's performance) and I like the point it tries to make. I can really relate with the two characters who are trying to find there place in the world, but it was the connection these two made that hit me the deepest. Making that kind of connection with another human being is a very rare and special thing. This movie also helped me to appreciate my Christian faith more which reminds me that I am never lost as long as I follow Christ. There were many things about this movie that touched me personally because I've been in simillar situations. There were some very humorous moments in this movie as well. The part were Bill Murray got on that lethal treadmill deal was hilarious \\"HELP!\\" The only part I despised about this movie was the strip club scene which made me feel more uncomfortable than the main characters felt. I can see why so many people would dislike this film, but I personally could relate with it because of my own experiences in life. One of the reviewers below me had stated that it was a racist film. It's unfortuante that he feels that way, but I would have to disagree. Maybe I'm just another ignorant American, but I found nothing hateful or racist about this movie.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I watched this movie with a group of people.  Half were in stitches the whole time and the other half walked out in the first ten minutes.  The half that walked out probably found it painful to watch because of the slow pace and the annoying characters.  But I loved it.  The other half is retarded.

For one, most of the scenes are on airplanes and the dialouge is very quiet and touching.  There is no way you can talk like that on an airplane in flight.  Especially after a guy ejects!!!  And the love story between the pilots?  Just ridiculous!  All the face stroking and peaceful banter, ridiculous!  We have to yell at the top of our lungs to talk in the jet off headset.  So STUPID!!!!  DO NOT waste your time with this movie.
0965750892|5.0|Right away you notice something different about the book.  It is written from the point of view of a 15-year-old boy with Asperger's Syndrome, which is essentially a type of autism.  He is amazingly brilliant with math, and likes everything in his life being orderly and as mathematically based as possible.  He is constantly coming up with equations to help him understand the world around him.  He cannot however understand emotions, does not like being touched, and has little (if any) intuition in many scenarios.  (For example, when asked to guess what was in a candy tin, he said candy.  It was opened and there was a pencil inside.  The tin was then re-closed and he was asked \\"What would your mother walked in right now, what would she guess is inside the tin?\\" and he said a pencil.)  The best way to describe him is being almost entirely left brained.  All logic; no emotion.  In a sense, he is entirely objective... no emotions to cloud the thought. <br /> <br />As I continued my journey, I got pulled out of my world and into his.  If you've ever wanted to get inside someone's heads and know their thoughts, know how they perceive the world around them, what upsets them, how they react to things, how they deal with stress, how they feel about others... really get inside the brain... well, this book is for you!  You are totally immersed in this brilliant child's mind.  Suddenly you become fully aware of this entirely different way of viewing the world, a different way of processing information and facts.  It seemed like I gained a whole new understanding of the world about me by reading the book.  (A truly special journey for those who are very right-brained, especially!) <br /> <br />I get lost in thought sometimes, wondering about our brains and how so much is unused and how great it would be to utilize those portions... or I think how great it would be if my memory was able to remember everything... but then I think that would be too much, too difficult... there is perhaps a defense mechanism within most brains that allows us to only see what we need or want to see, so we don't become totally over stimulated and shut down. <br /> <br />Christopher, the autistic narrator, seems to have proved my theory correct.  He sees and remembers everything.  He can't just glance down a street and think, \\"here is a tree lined street with several three flats\\" he takes it all in.  Every last detail is forever stored in his brain.  How many trees, how tall, which kind, their exact location, what flowers are around them, how many cars, what colour they are, what stickers they have on them, the type, where street lights are placed, etc etc etc ad nausem.  He won't forget any of it.  He can say on which day at which time he was where, and what the exact looks of everything was.  For this reason he has an immense distaste for new places.  They are too overwhelming, his brain taking every detail in.  Imagine trying to go to a mall when your brain is taking in every detail in camera-like precision.  How many people there are, what they are wearing, where they are located, where they are moving, what they are doing, and the overall surroundings about you.  As Christopher describes it, it is like the blue screen of death.   <br /> <br />I could go on and on, being in his brain is a truly fascinating trip!  However, if I go much further I would take the joy out of reading the book for yourself!
B0000X2EOW|5.0|This is the best fantasy/fiction movie ever! I saw this movie when i was 6 or so and i fell in love with it- ( and David Bowie). I thought he was great as the Goblin King and had a crush on him despite all his make up and glammed up look. He was so mysterious and the role fit him perfectly. Full of imagination, cute puppets and a great story. I suggest you get the Collectors edition boxed set because it contains over one hundred photo gallery images, behind the scenes( case character and script), poster gallery, story boards, a inside the labyrinth making of feauturette, trailers, talent files etc...<br /><br />Also contains a cool collectors edition scene composite  with a story on the back of Sarah encountering (The fierys) as they dance around her. Also comes with a collectors edition picture of horetenz and drawings plus a Collectors booklet with pictures and stories. This is truly a remarkable memorable film and will be loved by all ages! Highly Recomended. 5 Stars.
B000003N89|5.0|Diana Krall has become a huge selling singer over the years, which has often made her a target of the jazz \\"purists\\" who scoff at anything popular as a sellout.  Perhaps she's not the greatest lounge-style singer and pianist ever, but I would argue that she's very good, and has popularized that style of music with her success.  That's not a bad thing. <br /> <br />Of her CD's, I enjoy this one the most.  As another reviewer wrote here, it's a lot \\"swingier\\" than much of her other material, and she brings meaning to the lyrics, the playfulness and the innuendo of it all.  This album is a great place to start for those who've liked anything they've heard from Diana Krall.  What she does, in this case smoky lounge music, she does very well.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|Most Megadeth fans didnt really seem to like this album when it first came out. I thought it was decent/kinda liked it but was suprised at the new style and change they made to their sound. After listening to it all these years i love it. The songs are catchy though the lyrics arent as serious on some of the songs like prince of darkness or the doctor is calling- which are my 2 least favorites,. but the rest of the songs are really great with good beats/lyrics/guitar. Megadeth cant seem to make a bad album. Best songs on the album are crush em, breadline, Ill be there, Wanderlust (one of my favorites) insomnia and time. I would recomend this album to any Megadeth fan if you have an open mind and can appreciate a diffrent and unique sound from the band.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Not one other album in my life has provoked such a feeling of an insane emotional roller-coaster as De-Loused In the Comatorium. When you reach the end you have to pick up all of yourself which in the process of listening was thrown around the room (and you will never be the same again). You'll be awakened, you'll wonder what the hell just happened. To be honest, this is the best album of it's kind I own. Maybe it's because it's one of a kind.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is no doubt my favorite movie.  You will find yourself laughing at Napoleon's uber-geekiness within the first five minutes.  Whether or not you'll enjoy this movie depends on what kind of humor you like.  If you like stupid humor, like SpongeBob SquarePants, you'll love this movie.  On the other hand, if you like actual humorous humor, you may be better off with a movie like Shrek 2 or Dodgeball.  Still, I would highly recommend this to anyone who wants to see what it's like living life as a nerd, or just know what the heck is going on when someone tells you that \\"You're just jealous because I've been chatting online with babes all day.\\"
B0006213WG|3.0|First and foremost, it's not depressing when a goofy (yet equally entertaining) teenage rock group changes their style, it's pathetic when they don't. Enter groups like Everclear, Sugar Ray, Smash Mouth that at like 40 years old are still recording the lamest music to date. It's almost torture to listen to. \\"Chuck\\" rocks, more than any of their albums to date, \\"Half Hour Of Power\\" and \\"All Killer No Filler\\" were cool albums at the time, but their evolution into the new Sum 41 is a welcome change. The reason I bought the album was mainly because I heard Deryk actually whip out some scream vocals, which sounds great. He doesn't have the intensity, but it lends well to all the songs. This album is much more involved and intelligent than anything of the past. In all honesty, Sum is super entertaining, but not really a terribly talented band in the first place. On the bright side, their live show is unreal, I was impressed... and completely lit. Their new harder sound is great, if you're a fan and you can't get into the new sound, go pick up a Barenaked Ladies CD if you want more idiotic childish immitation rock.
B0006399FS|1.0|After a decade of innovation U2 got scared because the Americans weren't \\"getting it\\". During the 90s U2 made some of the most daring and original music (for a band in their position) with Achtung Baby, Zooropa, Passengers and Pop. They weren't all wholly successful - there are a few dodgy tracks on all of those albums. But it was the critical drubbing they received in the US of their last world tour Popmart which caused them to run for the hills and attempt to recreate the Joshua Tree.<br /><br />Unfortunately HTDAAB is nowhere near up to the Joshua Tree's class. It is dull, lame, insipid, tired and boring. U2 are my favourite band and the disappointment I felt when I first heard this record was overwhelming. I now consider this to be their worst ever album - even worse than the much loathed Rattle and Hum, or even October. It has but one good track. The stunning City Of Blinding Lights. Only there can you hear a ibt of the 90s U2 - radical in its construction and arrangement. And awe inspiringly beautiful. But you don't buy an album for one song, do you?<br /><br />The album is inconsistent though and falls short with those dull uninspired \\"songs\\". Miracle Drug and All Because Of You are an unremarkable compositions that tries a lot to sound like something U2 would have written back in the 80s.<br /><br />if you wanted to torture somebody like in Clockwork Orange, you could lock them in a room and put this worthless CD on repeat.<br /><br />The music sounds nice sometimes but it just kind of hangs there as mediocre background music with an occasional guitar solo or keyboard effect to make you remember that it's U2. What is the concept of this bulls**t? To make U2 a load of money that's what it is. Did it work? Yes it did. Is it good? Hell no it isn't. The music is definitely watered down and more blatantly commercial than what you'll hear on their classic records (80s and 90s).<br /><br />The whole record kind of takes on an atmosphere of resignation to a certainformula which works for this band. For the most part, they try with their well-known radio hit formula and there aren't surprises here. Here they are more or less pleasant background music to set the mood for the rest of the album and serve as a break from the radio hits.<br /><br />I'm not making excuses for this former great innovative band. This s**t is horrible, don't buy it.
B000001EAQ|5.0|My title says it all. The record is brimming with genuine emotion, beautiful and complex imagery and music, and lyrics that are at once passive and fire-breathing.  <br /> <br />Pop is a concept album of sorts, not musically, there are no recurring musical ideas or phrases, but thematically. The underlying theme in this album is humanity's increasing alienation and abandonment in the modern world. Pop is just full of intensity, innovation and originality. <br /> <br />Pop is a work of genius, non mainstream U2. It`s modern day Sgt Pepper.  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|This romantic and beautiful film begins at a rest home for the elderly.  \\"Duke\\" (James Garner) spends his time reading from a notebook to a woman suffering from Alzheimer's disease (Gena Rowlands).  The story in the notebook centers on two teenagers, Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams).  Noah is a underprivleged boy who lives with his father (Sam Shepard) and works at a local lumber yard.  Allie lives with very well-to-do parents and has aspirations of attending a prestegious college in New York.  Despite their very different upbringings, Noah and Allie begin a whirlwind romance that develops into genuine intimacy.  Allie's parents intervene to stop the romance, insisting that Noah isn't good for Allie, but the romance continues until the day comes that Allie must leave for college. <br /> <br />Despite writing to her for 365 consecutive days, Noah never receives word from Allie after she leaves for college.  Noah and his best buddy join the Army after the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, and Allie becomes a nurse volunteer, where she soon meets Lon Hammond (James Marsden).  Lon and Allie begin a romance of their own and fall in love.  Lon is much more appealing to Allie's parents, due to his wealth and fine upbringing.  Meanwhile, Noah returned home to restore his dream home.   <br /> <br />However, after a chance meeting, Noah and Allie rekindle their earlier relationship.  This reunion has forced Allie to choose between her true love and \\"class order\\".   <br /> <br />By this time in the movie, the viewer should be able to figure out the connection between \\"Duke\\" and the lady suffering from Alzheimer's.  \\"Duke's\\" caring and concern for the woman is a high point throughout the course of the film.  As for Allie, will she choose Noah or Lon? <br /> <br />This is an excellent film.  James Garner and Gena Rowlands give moving performances as the aging couple, and Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are superb as well.  The story is very cleverlyscripted, and it is heartwarming to see true love win in the end.  I highly recommend this film.  Watch and see how true love can overcome any obstacle.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day is the best punk rock band out there.  They still sound great, but the lyrics to their songs are more meaningful and thought provoking. I'm glad they received the recognition they did at the Grammys this year.  This is a very good album.  My favorite track is Boulevard of Broken Dreams.  It is a beautiful song about we all must find what makes us happy.  American Idiot is another hit on this album.  This is a song about the negative aspects of living in the information age.  The message of this song is that we have become so dependent on media and technology that we could lose the ability to think for ourselves if we are not careful.  Another song that really rocks is the track She's a Rebel.  This song really pumps me up.  Front Billy Joe Armstrong is a great vocalist, but I think that on this track all the other band members in Green Day shine on drums and bass respectively.  Jesus Of Suburbia is like a mini punk rock opera.  This track has an excellent pulsating drum beat and great guitar rifts.  This song is about how easy it is to feel angry, confused and apathetic when you don't feel in control of your life.  Extraordinary Girl is yet another hit song about feeling trapped and lonely in a lifestyle that you don't like.  This song is definitely one of my favorite tracks too.  American Idiot is simply Green Day's finest effort.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|I... can't say enough good things about this movie. This film has to be the funniest film i have ever seen. It's worth seeing just for the soundtrack which is nothing short of perfect. Matt and Trey have a unique way of putting a film together that you could not expect from any other movie-makers. I just hope that when the DVD comes out they will put enough extras in that will make people buy it on impulse so that they can see it.. and die laughing. I'd like to add that i have been a fan of south park for 2 years and own series 1-4 and can't wait for series 5 to come out, so i can relive those hilarious episodes (towlie, anyone!) I have seen every south park episode up to 814 and i am looking forward to series 9 which airs on March 9th. Also, i'm 14 and i can't see why people say that \\"you must to be 17 to see this movie\\" why? <br />Look how much i care, Stan, see, look at my face, this is how much i care. <br />Sorry, i just had to get a south park quote in there somewhere :) <br />Anyway, if you are not offended by south park you will love this movie.
B000268QB2|2.0|Does nobody but me think this is a mediocre emo band. This is pretty tame, average and actually quite boring at times. There is not very muh to get excited about, each song just meanders on to the next.  <br /> <br />Nice - which is a terrible word to describe anyone or anything, is just the word to describe this album. If you have an amazing cd collection, full of progressive, banging tunes and need an album to chill out to, that is still a 'indie/rock' album then fine buy this. But Keane are perhaps the most overrated bands of last year.  <br /> <br />The more people go on about how great they are, the more dull they seem.  <br /> <br />They are also rubbish live. They cant fill a school hall with their tiny live show. Neither of the three band members have as much talent as many of their peers. Coldplay are especially in no danger from this lot. <br /> <br />Having said all that: Somewhere only we know, is one of the best radio friendly chart hits or last year, and We Might As Well Be Strangers (although it has coldplay written all over it) is one of the more exciting and best track on the album.  <br /> <br />As for the rest, who cares. Check out these guys instead: The Perishers, Bang Gang, Athlete, AC Newman, Matt Pond PA, Doves, Styrofoam
B0006J28KU|5.0|When I first saw this film I was around 16 and wasn't that impressed mainly because I thought it was kind of boring. Now that I have matured I thought I would give it another try and I dusted off my DVD from my shelf and watched it for a second time tonight (four years later). I was blown away by the acting, screenplay, action, music, emotion, and the fact I felt bad for the \\"bad\\" guys. This film has it all and after this viewing it has moved up the ranks to my top 25 list of all time. Pacino and De Niro are magnificint to say the least. I can't believe this film didn't get a single Oscar. It should have been up at the very least for Best Picture and Director. This is one great film that took me too long to realize what I had been missing.
B00005JNEI|1.0|...this is FICTION. Or at very least, it is a distortion of fact.  Mr. Moore artfully splices together scenes and sound bites that do not belong together.  He cleverly manipulates the viewer into feeling precisely what he wants them to feel; for that he deserves a star.  I withhold the other stars based on the fact that Mr. Moore misleads his audience into believing that his presentation is factual.
B00005JNJ7|4.0|Anyone that watches South Park know that Trey Stone and Matt Parker like to make adult political satires based on pop culture and contemporary politics with a no-holds-bar style of bashing.  Team America: World Police is not any different.<br /><br />In Team America, the patriotic soldiers of freedom (Namely, Team America) are depicted at reckless, overreacting, over-destructive soldiers despite their good intentions of protecting people.  In the first scene, they blow up Paris while trying to stop four terrorists, later they do the same in Cairo.  Kim Jong Il and the terrorists are portrayed in stereotypical fashion of Middle Eastern/Islamic males with turbans on their heads, spouting off idiotic sounding jibberish (\\"Durka, Durka!  Muhammed Jihad!!\\").  Kim Jong Il is quite comical in his role as he kills Hans Blix, hosts a peace rally and even breaks into song at one point.  The Hollywood celebs are depicted as... well, wusses.  People, that prefer to blame those who fight terrorism, rather than the terrorists themselves and even band together with Kim Jong Il to stop Team America.<br /><br />Now believe it or not, but this all serves a purpose to explain a sort of \\"balance\\" in the world between those who fight terrorism, those who sue for peace and those who oppose peace.  It's rather interesting, but this is a review, not a political commentary.<br /><br />Now politics aside, this movie is not for anyone under 17.  The jokes are rather crude, involving drunken vomiting, an explicit sex scene, blown up bodies, animals eating corpses, shark attack... all involving puppets.  Which makes it rather humorous in some areas, especially with the \\"Kung fu\\" fight scenes.  The puppet works is done extremely well in some scenss, but horribly done in others, which is supposed to make it funny.<br /><br />Team America was extremely funny when I first saw it in theatres.  I hit the floor laughing when Michael Moore... well, you'll just have to see.  However, the 2nd time around, it wasn't all that funny, especially after the tsunami incident in Asia.  It's mostly shock humor that loses it's taste to the general audience after the first showing.  Nonetheless, I still enjoyed this movie emensely and I recomend it to anyone that desires to see another side of the political spectrum.<br /><br />Be forewarned, this movie will probably offend you no matter what political idealogy you follow.  But do not let that ruin the experience.time around, it wasn't all that funny, especially after the tsunami incident in Asia.

B000063DFN|5.0|Yes Indeed this had to of been thier finest hour of Maiden History! This was the second album I ever listened to from the great catalog of all of thier albums ever made! Once I put this cd into my stereo a few years back, I just couldn't shut it off. So in other words it wasn't boring at all! It was like the \\"Beast\\" album, just kept coming with great songs, and yes a few to play some air guitar to as well ;) Aces High was my all time favorite song and is still to this day. 2 Minutes To Midnight was a great song explaining what could happen if the wrong hands got to the nuclear bomb and destroying of the earth. But then the other songs on that album, don't even ignore they are great in thier own rights. We have Flash of the Blade which was a great song about a fencer, which is one of Bruce's past time hobbies, The Duellists another one of thier best songs. Then the last three which totally was a nice ending to thier effort, \\"Back In The Village\\", thier title track, and \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" which is one of the best stories ever told in a musical aspect. They have an instrumental on here called \\"Loss for Words\\" which is a pretty well jammin tune. I was never really into instrumentals until I heard this one. It just was going and never got boring. But after hearing this album I knew that Iron Maiden was capable of anything and could do any song they wanted to play and it would still sound superb. Great solos on every song, and this is coming from a guitar player! For all of you peeps trying out Maiden I would recommend this being your second album to listen to with the Golden Age singer, none other than Bruce Dickinson! Also this was the start of a long world tour known as \\"The World Slavery Tour\\" which is a very great cd and dvd. and on cd it's known as Live After Death. Enjoy this album and defitnitely turn the volume up on this because you will not regret it! Cheers!!!
B0002KVUKM|3.0|It seems very difficult to rate badly a movie which keeps on your chair with fear, action and great special effects for almost two hours. Photography and camera effects are fantastic. And not to mention about the costume design, backgrounds and even music. <br /> <br />Yes, details are of importance, and in this movie, they have been carefully chosen and put into practice. The computer work is terrific and sure it took thousands of work-hours. <br /> <br />But, we must be truthful. The mixture of characters is, at least, unfortunate. It is more or less \\"the league of extraordinary monsters\\". Gabriel Van Helsing is a XIXth Century James Bond, with a notable exception: \\"Q\\", that is, Carl is not only the source of all weapons and trickeries, but is like the fellow servant of Van Helsing. <br /> <br />Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde role is stupid, Frankenstein's \\"good mood\\" is pathetic, and only Count Dracula is the very very bad. I think it's not a matter of using all characters together. The problem is how to use them and, this is very important, how to perform them. Actors seem to be amateur and only computer can make good face and body expressions and motions. <br /> <br />I think there won't be a second part, but it would be funny to see Van Helsing fighting the Mummy, Godzilla or King Kong. Being serious, This film has been a lost opportunity of making a good horror film.
B000003C4K|5.0|This has to be the best Exodus album ever made. Don't get me wrong the others are as well, but with the raw sound and energy they produced with Baloff on vocals putting his effort on the title track, No Love, Deliver Us To Evil, And Then There Were None, and Exodus he expressed a technique that was the epitomy of the Exodus thrash saga. Didn't care too much for Souza's examples of And Then There Were None, and A Lesson In Violence. Don't get me wrong he's a great singer, but the original stands out best with Baloff. Exodus to this day is one of the best Bay Area thrash outfits of thier time and still produces the best on the West Coast. I defitenately recommend this album to any first time Exodus listeners before buying \\"Tempo Of The Damned\\" so you get a feel of what old Exodus was like with Baloff on Lead. Enjoy this album and play it loud like it was meant to be. Cheers!!!
B000687M48|2.0|this cd has been terribly recorded. Everything is on the same level and it just sounds flat. Amy needs to concentrate more on her performance and vocals rather than jumping around like an idiot. This cd lacks everything fallen has. But  even over that, Origin was by far the greatest album they have come up with. Sad that they never even acknowledge it exists.
0767812387|5.0|I've seen this movie once before on cable, and I looked for it and could never find it until now.  And, I've watched this movie <br />twice already.  Vanessa  Williams such a wonderful actres.  And the latin singer Chayanne is such a sexy, handsome actor in this movie. <br /> <br />If you like Dirty Dancing,  you will love this movie.  It's just something about dancing and falling in love that makes you wanna do it too!
B0002234LS|1.0|Secret Window (David Koepp, 2004)<br /><br />What I still haven't figured out is how no one realized that \\"Secret Window, Secret Garden,\\" the story upon which the film Secret Window is based, was nothing more than a rehash of Stephen King's novel The Dark Half from a slightly different perspective. Now, The Dark Half was taken on by a mighty, mighty director, George Romero, and it failed miserably. David Koepp is a good director (witness Stir of Echoes) and, when he wants to be, a fantastic writer (Bad Influence, the underrated TV series Hack), but let's face it, David Koepp is not on the level of George Romero. So why did anyone think this was going to work?<br /><br />Granted, they assembled one of the finest casts in recent history here-- Johnny Depp, Golden Globe winner and nominated for more Golden Globes, Oscars, and Oranges than you can shake a stick at; Golden Globe nominee and Cannes Best Actor winner John Turturro; Golden Globe nominee Maria Bello; Oscar and Golden Globe winner Timothy Hutton; Emmy winner and Golden Globe nominee Charles S. Dutton... I could keep going, but why? You've got a who's-who of underrated Hollywood already. And every one of them turns in a performance as wooden as the trees in Maine. Even Johnny Depp, who in a thirty-film career has never, even in his worst films, played a role that wasn't excellent, is off form here for the first (and perhaps only) time in his career. Depp, who has made a number of otherwise awful films worth watching, however marginally (Sleepy Hollow, The Astronaut's Wife, Don Juan DeMarco), can't save this turkey. The pacing is horrendous, and boredom will set in before ten minutes have passed. I will warn you, it gets no better. This is a thriller completely devoid of thrills, a mystery that's solvable long before the boneheads on the screen work it out. Normally, watching Johnny Depp act would be enough reason to rent this, but it doesn't cut the mustard this time. *
B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero is my favorite Nirvana album out of the 3. It's depressing and eerie in a way because you know that Kurt committed suicide soon after this album was released, and the lyrics in the songs tend to be dark. <br />So obviously this album has lots of emotion in it, and that's what makes music good. Music is a way of expressing yourself, and if you really have something to express it's gonna turn out good. Sure it's a very raw album and it takes several listens but once you're used to it you really become attached to it. <br /> <br />Even though I think it's Nirvana's best album, DO NOT make this your first Nirvana album. Get Nevermind first, it's much more \\"listener friendly\\" than this.
6305291446|4.0|Halloween H20 is the seventh movie of the Halloween series and is in my opionion the best since the first one mainly due to the return of Jamie Lee Curtis. The only down side is that there is no Dr Sam Loomis due to the unfortunete passing of Donald Plescense. In case of confusion, H20 is not really linked to H4, H5 and H6 and is more linked to John Carpender's opening two Halloween movies.  <br /> <br />The story is based of Laurie Strode, now named Keri Tate having faked her death. She is now head mistress of a high school in Summer Glen, California. She is still suffering the trauma of her ordeal in 1978 and as Halloween approaches is having nightmares and seing reflections of her maniac brother Michael Myers. But of course, Myers tracks her down and Strode is now in a desperate situation to save herself and her son John.  <br /> <br />This is a good movie, without being overly good. It's well acted and well script and the story line is excellent. I would not recommend this film for anyone who hasn't seen the first two movies. I also like the fact that the movie goes back to basics like the first two movies rather than all the rubbish about the 'thorn' constellation in the last movie.
B000003TA4|5.0|Yes, Nevermind is a very overrated album, and I don't think it's Nirvana's best album either. In Utero is my favorite Nirvana album. <br />But, nevertheless, Nevermind is an enjoyable album. There's lots of cool songs that will stay in your head for weeks (Smells Like Teen Spirit, Breed). People give this album 1 star because it's \\"overrated\\". Just because it's overrated doesn't mean it sucks, this album has some VERY good moments on it. So what if it \\"isn't really Nirvana\\", that doesn't mean it sucks either, it means that Kurt and his band was exploring new territory. <br />If you're interested in Nirvana, this should be your first album by them. Although In Utero is an overall better album (IMO) it's a lot harder to get into. <br /> <br />This was Nirvana's \\"breakthrough\\" album for a reason, pick it up. <br />
0061015725|3.0|As a fan of Mr. Crichton since Jurassing Park, I was eagerly looking forward to this work. After reading this book, however, I have to say I don't entirely know what to make of it. The premise is certainly frightening. The idea of nanotechnology running amok is a truly frightening idea, all the more so due to the current advances in that field. However, the story bogs down in the protaganist's strange family life for the first third of the book. Only after the main character makes his way to Xymos' plant in the desert does the story begin to become interesting. The emphasis on his family life could be much more engaging if any of the characters were remotely likeable. However, they're not. Reading the story, I almost wonder if Mr. Crichton didn't intentionally strive for an unsympathetic cast for whatever reason. The first-person perspective heightens the mystery aspect of the story, but becomes irritating after a while. Such an approach is always dangerous for a writer, because whatever the central character is thinking is almost always more interesting to the writer than to the reader. The book also has a rather formulaic feel to it, with the same basic problems recurring as in all of Crichton's books. In fact, it's basically Jurassic Park with more annoying characters and less interesting \\"monsters\\". The characters and their fates are painfully predictable, even if the plot isn't. Indeed, the plot is one of the weakest areas of the book. The bizarre idea of the machines developing intelligence and taking human form passes the point of compelling and enters into the realm of the truly bizarre at a certain point. The ending is maddeningly ambiguous, explaining virtually nothing and basically just leaving the reader with a massive question mark. When I finally put it down, all I could think was, \\"What?\\". I also found the scientific aspect of this story to be overdone in comparison to his previous works, and generally less interesting. On the whole, I'd recomend sticking with Mr. Crichton's earlier works, such as the gripping Jurassing Park, or the far more original Time Line.
B0002OERI0|3.0|American Idiot is one of those \\"really ok\\" albums. I might find it more tolerable if there weren't so many kids out there who \\"OMG luv greenday\\" just because of this album. This isn't really Green Day, they're a punk band and this album isn't really a punk album. Sure there's some great songs on here but I think the album is boring as a whole. Kids who gave \\"Blvd of Broken Dreams\\" a 1000000/10 and said \\"OMG teh best song EVR!!1\\" and \\"American Idiot\\" a 7/10 really don't know what they're talking about, IMO. Sure Boulevard of Broken Dreams is a good song but there's SO many better songs out there! American Idiot is a PUNK song, what I bought this album for, and for those of you that say it gets boring, listen to \\"when september ends\\" 5 times and tell me what song is REALLY boring on this album. <br />Is there a possibility that kids buy and like this album because \\"everyone else likes it\\"? Of course. They want to be like everyone else so they hop in their raft and go down the mainstream. I bet if NOFX sold out and released their own version of American Idiot, everyone would hate it. <br /> <br />Now don't get me wrong, this cd doesn't totally suck. \\"American Idiot\\" is a very cool song if you ignore the absurd lyrics. \\"Holiday\\" is a really cool catchy song, very enjoyable. \\"Blvd of Broken Dreams\\" is SO overrated but it's not a bad song, it just isn't NEARLY as good as it's said to be. \\"She's a Rebel\\" and \\"St. Jimmy\\" are PUNK songs on this album that I like too. <br /> <br />Now about those 9 minute songs with 5 parts on here that everyone says are \\"genius\\". Sure it's something new but these songs are really hard to follow and it would me much cooler to have five two minute songs with a gap in between them, wouldn't it? And about how cool it is that this album tells a story, just so you guys know every album out there tells a story ;) <br /> <br />For punk I recommend NOFX, Rancid, Pennywise. <br />For a recent mainstream rock album, get Sum 41's Chuck.
B000002OTL|4.0|I love the soundtrack! Although, like Kill Bill's, I think there's not enough music on it! I just love the song they are playing on the twist contest: Ces la vie, by Jerry Lee Lewis... <BR>Anyway it's a great CD!
B00005A46T|5.0|Slipknot's 2nd album, IOWA, is often called slipknot's worst album. I really don't understand why, sure the band changed a little, but that doesn't mean this album sucks. With this album Slipknot tried to move away from the rap-metal that their first album contained. IOWA may not be what some people consider \\"real metal\\" but it's a much better attempt than the self-titled album.  <br />IOWA has some amazing songs on it, including People=S**t, My Plague, Everything Ends, Left Behind, New Abortion and Iowa. <br />IOWA is a very dark album, (515), Gently, Skin Ticket and Iowa are all very creepy tracks on this album, which makes it feel much more genuine than the self-titled album. <br /> <br />I don't recommend getting this as your first slipknot album, however. Vol. 3 should be your first album by Slipknot, it shows their real talent. If you like that then try out Iowa, and if you still like Slipknot go for their self-titled album, which I think is the band's worst album but a must-have for any fans of Slipknot.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I just saw this movie twice yesterday and I couldnt believe how good it was.I saw Before Sunrise before and I think this is better.  Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy contributed to the screenplay so the acting is very natural and spontaneous (Julie Delpy even composed and sung some of the songs in the soundtrack) and its remarkable that they still have great chemistry even Before Sunrise was filmed almost a decade ago.There are no cliches and even though were just watching these two people talking,its fast paced and I was so sorry when it was finished.Its only an hour and twenty minutes but you cant help but be enriched and inspired.The ending was a little confusing but maybe its up to the viewers to guess what happened.Did he get on the plane or what?  I highly recommend this movie.Its smart and witty. But it will be better to watch Before Sunrise first so youll know these characters better.Bravo!
B00005QIPH|4.0|I have this feeling that the people who are so mercilessly bashing these guys are more outraged by all the hype that surrounds this young band.Having picked up on The Strokes \\"post-hype\\", I was able to listen with an un-biased ear and take the music for what it really was.Sure, there isn't anything ground-breaking here-but the music is fresh, its fun, energetic, and very enjoyable. \\"The Strokes\\" aren't musical gods, but they write sweet tunes, and the instrumentation is tight. They don't sound like every other band out there, and their popularity is easily credible to the fact that their music is genuinely fun without sacrificing the band's artistic integrity. <br /> <br />Is This It is a VERY fun and upbeat album. There isn't a single downer-if you don't get the urge to nod your head somewhere in the middle of the album, something is seriously wrong with you. So, chill out, ignore the hype, turn the music up, and sing along to this fresh, fun, and zesty band.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I had never really heard of this band until a friend introduced me to a band called Green Day. Of course I was rather cautious with thoughts of immature lyrics and tunes in my mind. However when I gave the two singles American Idiot and Boulevard of Broken Dreams a chance the general sound grew on me and inspired me to give this album a chance. Having listened to it I have to say the majority of the songs really are very good. The opening song American Idiot is a very fast paced track which is certainly very enjoyable to listen to with a very catchy tune. The following song Jesus of Surburbia explores a slower side to the band with a rather interesting mix of traditional loud and fast sounds with a somewhat slower sound and more focus on the lyrics. At over 9 minutes you might think it would be easy to press te skip button after half of the time however the interesting changes in various parts of the song keep you interested. The third track, Holiday is a rather more upbeat, fast tune not dissimilar from the opening track Amiercan Idiot. As far as the 'fast' tracks go on this album Holiday has to be my favourite of them. Boulevard of Broken Dreams is a much slower, meaningful song which certainly shows that there is more to this band than fast loud playing. The quieter more sinister sound of the instruments combine well with the greater lyrical focus seen within this song. Another quieter song follows in the shape Are We The Waiting. This song is good but it's qualities are diminshed by the fact that it follows the immensly good Boulevard of Broken Dreams which is surely one of the best tracks on this album. St. Jimmy is the only real throwback we see to Green Days original punk rock days in a rather enjoyable high octance song. Another favourite of mine on this album, perhaps a little surprsingly was Give Me Novocaine. I found that the rather muted sound of the instruments allowed the lyrical abilities of Billie Joe Armstrong to shine through which is not always clearly seen from this genre of music. Shes a Rebel and Extraordinary Girl are probably two of the weaker songs on the album with the tunes being kept a little too simplistic and whilst decent tracks that just seem to lack the sophistication seen on the rest of the album. A rather muted throwback to the old days of the band is seen in Letterbomb which, like the more obvious throwback track St. Jimmy shows some of the orginal flair that brought the band this far. Wake Me Up When September Ends is a rather enjoyable melody with some rather elegant usages of language throughout. It's nice to see that the band show their growing with more meaningful tracks like this. The final two tracks on the album Homecoming and Whatsername sound rather similar to the general sound observed on this album and, although not particularly bad songs they are certainly not highlights of this album. American Idiot is an album which shows a bands maturing, with songs like Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Wake Me Up When September Ends to better things but also rather pleasingly makes reference to the genre through songs like St. Jimmy. This is not an album for pure punk rock fans however if you are the type who enjoys some sophisticated music with a light sprinkling of loosen up tunes then this album is certainly for you.
0385510454|3.0|With this book, Grisham proves himself to be our most overrated author.  This book is great if you are looking for a travelogue of Italy.  However, that isn't why I bought the book.  I had hoped for some exciting action, cool inside stories of the government, and a character who you felt might actually not make it.  Instead, we get a majorly convoluted story, a climax where you never once have any doubt about how the story will turn out, and a lame ending.  In fact, in the afterward, JG brags about his lack of research on government agencies.  This is something to be proud of?  I think not.  He has become lazy.  I guess that happens when you write your best book first and then only write something decent every few years.  This isn't one of them.
B0002EXFNI|3.0|This film was almost universally panned by critics as a failed imitation of Risky Buisness.  While the comparison is probably appropriate, I do think the critics were a little too harsh with the film.  The movie's first act, undoubtedly its finest,  introduces the film's protagonist, a high school senior.  As the movie opens, he is reflecting on his High School experience, only to realize that he has nothing worth mentioning. <br /> <br />Mathew isn't one of the cool kids who cut class or wear a letterman's jacket.  He's the class president and intends on attending Georgetown next year.  He wonders, however, just what it would be like to be one of the jocks.  Enter Elisha Cuthbert's character, who gets Mathew to shed his timid nature.  This section of the movie is actually quite enjoyable and the characters are still appealing.  <br /> <br />Unfortunately, it doesn't last.  As soon as we discover Elisha Cuthbert's character's past the movie starts its dive into becoming just another brainless, overtly raunchy teen comedy, the likes of which the world has too many of as it is.   <br /> <br />The peculiar thing about \\"The Girl Next Door\\" is that it never truly sinks to the same level of the \\"American Pie\\" films or \\"Dude, Where's my Car.\\"  Rather it tries to be both \\"American Pie\\" and \\"Risky Buisness.\\"  The result is that for last three quarters of the film, it seems unsure of what it is, alternating between crude humor and a respectable coming of age story.  The movie is redeemed by strong performances by the two leads, Emile Hirsch and Elisha Cuthbert, who manage to create appealing characters despite the offensive situations they are thrown in. <br /> <br />In the end, I give the movie three stars for the first quarter of the movie and what it could have been, more than what it actually was.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|This video rocks!!! I got this video from my friend Julian Parris, from Aliso Viejo, CA. He thought i would like this video <br />since I'm a big Guns N' Roses fan. And I like it a lot, I can <br />see most of my favorites how GNR plays them, my best would be <br />November Rain, Sweet Child O' Mine, Paradise City, Welcome to <br />the Jungle,& Live & Let Die. But some how its' not so great because it's missing some of the others that I like, such as You <br />Could Be Mine, Civil War, Mr. Brownstone, & Knockin' on Heaven's <br />Door. Take out Don't Cry into You Could Be Mine for better video <br />of this. And also, take out Since I Don't Have You into Civil <br />War. Then this video would rock harder if them 11 songs were here. Let me explain what would make this video better. <br /> <br /> 1. Welcome to the Jungle <br /> 2. Sweet Child O' Mine <br /> 3. Paradise City <br /> 4. Mr. Brownstone <br /> 5. Patience <br /> 6. Live and Let Die <br /> 7. November Rain <br /> 8. Civil War <br /> 9. Knockin' on Heaven's Door <br />10. Estranged <br />11. You Could Be Mine <br /> <br />For many Guns n' Roses fans must own this video. <br />
0425188809|5.0|When one of my co-workers suggested this book to me, I was intrigued with the concept and went out and bought it.  A few weeks passed before I actually picked it up and read it....and once it was in my hands, I couldn't put it down!!!!!<br /><br />The two main human characters are endearing and you cheer from them from the get-go....the two non-human characters are nothing but sheer genius!!!!!!  This book made me laugh, cry, and kept on the edge of my seat so much I practically fell on the floor.<br /><br />This is truly the BEST book I think I've ever read....as Dean Koontz himself puts it....other books I have written are as good, but nothing has been better than Watchers!!!!
B00005B36H|5.0|This album is not really an album, it is more of an experience. The guitar riffs are great (as with all Tool albums) and the vocals are equally good. However, what allows Lateralus to transcend most other rock albums is the feeling throughout. The album all fits together with an interesting New Age theme. Tool manipulates the emotions with their music, and this is what makes it so amazing. Some of there songs exude peace, like The Patient, while others stir up terror.  Let me warn you: the album ends with a track called \\"Faaip De Oiad\\". If you buy this album, do not listen to this track alone at night because it will scare the crap out of you. It goes to show how powerful the music is. If you are seeking a great album to make you think or to meditate to, then Lateralus is a great choice.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|This is one of the best shows on TV! I first heard of it when I went to visit my sister and ended up watching the complete first season while on vacation!! The plot is dynamic and the characters really have a depth to them with the quick verbal banter and amusing one-liners kept me entertained for hours UNENDING!!! I loved it.
B0002Z0EYK|2.0|Don't buy it.  Just keep browsing because this movie is not \\"it\\" and will cause you to ask \\"how do I get rid of this crap\\" after and if you can make it through one viewing.   <br /> <br />Hollywood has really added all the prime elements here, being (A) an all-star cast that have been superb in the majority of their other works (Peter O'Toole, Brian Cox, Eric Bana, and even Brad Pitt).  Moving on to (B) a great director, Wolfgang Peterson, who directed terrific movies like \\"Das Boot\\" and lesser greats like \\"In the Line of Fire\\".  Okay, we've got two pretty big chunks of the pie already, director and stars.  Now, (C) the concept of the story itself is wonderful and has been told for thousands of years.  The story of Troy has inspired a variety of authors and films and led to both direct and indirect recreations of Homer's \\"Iliad\\".  Budget covered?  Yes, plenty.  Special effects?  Yes, enough to keep from hiring extras and building model ships.  Now all these factors together, you think that it would be near impossible to fail?  Everything is in place, but somehow, maybe so much positive counter-acts itself and becomes negative.  Simply put, in no way does this movie add up to (D) a movie worth watching more than once, let alone all the way through the first time.  Time and time again we see Hollywood fail in this way.  \\"League of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" is another example of this kind of bad Hollywood math that results in painful cinema.   <br /> <br />This movie got annoying because I'd just seen all these actors in Lord of the Rings.  So Orlando Bloom grabs a bow in this movie and has a cool arrow scene?  Hey, that's great, don't worry about being different for this movie, we'll just go for what worked with this actor in Lord of the Rings (the funny voice on Bobcat Goldwaith never got old and steered him to a powerhouse of success, didn't it?).  Don't produce a variation on what I just watched a month ago, give me something that at least is different enough to beinteresting.  Troy is a case of poor direction, lackluster acting by good actors, painful dialogue, a total abortion of a great story, would-be cinematography, and chinsy music by Horner (on that \\"note\\", the ending credits song was probably one of the most painful.  It's like they switched the Troy end soundtrack for the one from Beaches).  All in all, what a waste of my time that I even bothered to buy this movie.  Now I'm asking myself that question of what am I going to do with it?  Maybe the box will be better suited as a $20 coaster to set my drink on for when I watch a movie worth more than two stars.
B00004WEJZ|3.0|He's back and this time he is better than the last time. Sean Connery definitely is the real James Bond, a perfect embodiment of the famous super spy. <br /> <br />After having sat through all those Roger Moore movies (Who kept it going but also turned Bond into a joker), it was really refreshing to see Connery back. He is 53 but looks better that in Diamonds are Forever. The movie even though a remake of Thunderball has been well tailored for the 80's. <br /> <br />Although i thought that the character of th villain (Now what was his name) could have been refined a little but the women all in all made up for it. I do agree that this was quite a raunchy Bond movie and i must say that Barbara Carrera does a wonderful job as Fatima Blush. The action is customised to suit the ageing Bond who does it better than most. <br /> <br />All in all i would say that this movie might disappoint the purists (traditional Bond fans) but it nevertheless delivers. <br /> <br />Always good to see Sean Connery donning the tux. <br /> <br />Welcome back Mr. Bond
B000002U8G|5.0|This is the Pink Floyd album that's got it all: <br /> <br />1) One Of These Days - it's slow at first with the basically non-chord changes and repetitive riff, but once the \\"One of these days, I'm going to cut you into little pieces\\" kicks in, all Hell breaks loose!  A great rocker to begin an album. <br /> <br />2) A Pillow Of Winds - it's sissy, but okay.  Alright so I think it's a dissapointment.  It is sissy!   <br /> <br />3) Fearless - very cool.  That's about it... <br /> <br />4) San Tropez - in my opinion, Pink Floyd's goofiest song.  It just isn't like them.  But I like it!  It's smooth, easy, simple, and happy!  The last characteristic seems almost nonexistent from hereon out.  It makes me think I'm at the beach.  I suppose that's a good thing, if I want to be at the beach. <br /> <br />5) Seamus - I really don't get it...it's blues with a dog in the background. <br /> <br />6) Echoes - this is where it's at.  This is where Pink Floyd is like, \\"Here's our sound and stuff like that...and of that matter.  Yeah.\\"  I don't know, maybe it didn't happen like that.  But it sure seems like it did.  It's long, chillin', and doesn't get boring.  Now that take talent!
B0002X314C|5.0|This CD is a WINNER from top to bottom. One of the best genuine soul albums to come along in awhile. This guy is the real thing. I absolutely love this album. I don't have to skip a single song. <br /> <br />Prelude 5/5 <br />Let's Get Lifted 5/5 <br />Used to Love U 5/5 <br />Alright 5/5 <br />She Don't Have To Know 5/5 <br />Number One 4/5 <br />I Can Change 5/5 <br />Ordinary People 4/5 <br />Stay With You 5/5 <br />Let's Get Lifted Again 4/5 <br />So High 4/5 <br />Refuge 5/5 <br />It Don't Have To Change 5/5 <br />Live It Up 5/5 <br />
B000002U9W|5.0|This is tied for my favorite PF album with Wish You Were Here.  The title track is brilliant!  The horns with the band is so cool sounding, and the chorus at the end is spectacular.  Summer '68 is just as exciting with it's bombastic horn parts.  If and Fat Old Sun are good too.  They're kind of soft and wimpy sounding but It's a different side of Floyd.  Yeah...and the breakfast that psychadelic and belongs to Alan is okay.  But I would go far enough to say that the rest is perfect.  Anyone who has a problem with this is...is...is...not a neat guy and/or gal (so I don't offend anyone out there).
0375756728|5.0|This edition of LITTLE WOMEN is great!  First of all, there's the wonderful story of the March family in the years during and after the Civil War, as the 4 daughters -- Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy -- grow to womanhood, experiencing joy and overcoming obstacles and tragedy.  This edition stays true to the language and grammar used in the original.  I have read versions of the novel in which the girls' grammar is cleaned up for them!<br /><br />In addition, the introduction by Susan Cheever is first-rate; it is neither too long or too short, and she beautifully ties it to her own experience without being cloying.<br /><br />Another reason why I so highly recommend this edition is because there is a glossary at the back to explain some of the obscure (to modern readers) terms and obsolete slang.  Also, there's a nice essay/review by G.K. Chesterson, who warmly praises Alcott's book.
B000002UA5|3.0|Let me clarify my rating: the live album is 5 stars, and the studio album is...not.  I know that's a pretty typical review, but it is so true!  The studio stuff is just so noisy and not very cool.  In fact, there is no cool factor - wait - I like David Gilmour's The Narrow Way, and I'm even a Roger Waters type of guy!  But I guess that doesn't matter...Sysyphus gives me a headache, SEVERAL SMALL SPECIES OF SMALL FURRY ANIMALS GATHERED TOGETHER IN A CAVE AND GROOVING WITH A PICT is actually okay (I like it's name), but Granchester Meadows is boring!  And I won't even comment on The Grand Vizier's Lame Garden Party...I guess I just did though.  Actually, it's cool that they got away with that experimental stuff.  The live album is fabulous though.  Astronomy Domine and Careful With That Axe, Eugene (which is my favorite Floyd recording ever) are superior to the studio versions, but I prefer the original Saucerful Of Secrets.  Set controls for the heart of the sun seems real similar to the studio version, but good nonetheless.  All in all, this is great stuff.  Ofcourse like anything else, die hard fans must have this, but if you're just a casual listener you should get The Piper At The Gates of Dawn, A Saucerful Of Secrets, or Relics.  But if you get all of those you might as well get this too.  Right?  Yes.
0060934913|5.0|...or I would've choked from laughing so much and so hard!  I really enjoyed Bourdain's edgy and humorous look at what goes on behind the scenes in restaurants.  Especially funny were his early days in this environment as he struggled to learn his craft and get a clue.<br /><br />Although Anthony Bourdain is vulgar and very much over-the-top [I loved every line, and even picked up some new and colorful expressions to use in my own kitchen!] in relating his experiences, I never felt like he was putting the reader on, especially since the book ends with a description of a VERY LONG day in the life of a chef.
B000002U82|5.0|Hmmm...this is a good album...it is one of their best...the music is there...the lyrics are there...the atmosphere and mood are there...the concept is prevelent...what's not to like?  Well, I will tell you what's not to like, because most of the other reviews are telling you why it's so great. <br /> <br />1) Speak To Me/Breathe: this is bad...well...not really.  Okay, so there really is nothing bad to say about any of this album.  It's absolutley amazing on any and every level!  It's not my favorite Floyd album, but it is up there.  Back to Breathe - a great way to start off.  The reprise in Time is perfectly done and brings sort of a theatrical feel into the groove. <br /> <br />2) On The Run: if I had to pick one song to be the worst, this would be it, but it's still a good one.  It just kind of goes on and on, but I like that sort of thing.   <br /> <br />3) Time:  Who doesn't like the sound of all those alarm clocks?  \\"Ticking away the moments that make up a dole day,\\" have to be some of the greatest lyrics ever written.  And then there is that reprise of Breathe which I always look forward to because I'm a loser. <br /> <br />4) The Great Gig In The Sky:  Great lyrics.  My favorite song on the whole thing!  If you ever watch The Wizard of Oz with Dark Side, pay attention to this track.  It is crazy!  When the tornado and the music match perfectly! <br /> <br />5) Money: I like it just becasue it's in 7/8. <br /> <br />6) Us And Them: Good stuff.  I mean, that's all I can say about it.   <br /> <br />7/8/9) Any Colour You Like/Brain Damage/Eclipse: I group these three songs together because I believe they are the GRAND FINALE!  And boy is it grand.  Leave it to Roger Waters to create unnecessarily huge and overdramatic endings to albums (ex. The Trial in The Wall).  But it is terriffic!  I think Dark Side Of The Moon has my favorite finale out of any album, although Joe's Garage A Little Green Rosetta comes close. <br /> <br />This is the album that every humanbeing needs to have.  It is just too cool to pass up on.  There is not one bad song on here.  Get it...or else.
B00062IVKI|2.0|I love this movie.  I have owned the VHS version since the 70s when it came out, and saw the theatrical release at least 4 times.  I was so excited to hear that it was being released on DVD that I pre-ordered it immediately from Amazon last year, with great expectations.  The DVD finally arrived earlier this month.  To my horror, the sound quality is AWFUL (muted, garbled), there are big green streaks/lines in the \\"But the World Goes Round\\" scene (where Liza is singing against a darkened studio with only a spotlight on her face).  The title song scene is muted and of poor quality.  C'mon, MGM!!!  You need to re-release this. AND PLEASE RELEASE IT IN WIDESCREEN, NOT LETTERBOX!!!!! (To Amazon.com's credit, however, I have to say that with no questions asked, they have offered to send me a replacement immediately, without even having to return the original due to high cost of shipping from Canada to the US.  Makes me happy to be an Amazon customer)
B000002UA2|5.0|Even though though I rate OBC 5 stars, there is actually nothing real special about it.  Free Four is pretty fun, and so is Childhood's end, but anyone could pull them off.  The soft instrumentals in my opinion are what set this album apart.  Good, great, and even astounding...but nothing special.  It is one-of-a-kind in a sense that there are no other Floyd albums like it, but it's not groundbreaking like Dark Side or The Wall if you get my drift.
B000089CJI|5.0|If you like New Wave Rock, like Coldplay, and the Killers, you'll love this, it is amazing.  You must know it is really classified as Electro-Rock, because it has electrica sounds with rock instruments.  The first track is in the upcoming movie \\"Imaginary Heroes\\" and no wonder, because its probably the best on here.  But every song is great, it'll get you in a chill mood.  I'm more of a rap fan, but I'll recommend it to anyone.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have now been to see this movie 1/2 dozen times and each time I got something different out of it - I loved it and cannot wait to have my special edition of DVD - hats off to Joel Schumacher and Andrew Lloyd Webber - and to the three \\"unknowns\\" - you are now known forever by your Phans !!! <br />B. Phelan
B0002858YS|5.0|I'm not a big rock fan, as a matter of fact, I prefer Rap like 50 cent and Mobb Deep.  I only started listening to Rock a few years ago when I heard Coldplay's \\"Clocks.\\"  After that I felt in love with this sort of New Wave style of rock; Coldplay, The Postal Service, and The Killers are on the top of my list.  The Killers did a great job with this album, most of the songs are those type of songs that could be a sitcom's theme song, if you know what I mean.  My favorite is \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\"; it has a slow start but then the drums kick in, with a great chorus.  Another good one is \\"On Top,\\" as it has sort of a techno-rock vibe to it. <br /> <br />Overall, I recommend this album to anyone who likes great music, regardless of what you're into.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Let's get this out of the way. I'm not an \\"old school\\" Green Day fan. I didn't know about them when they were still \\"punk.\\" I don't know why one punk-sounding song differs in authenticity from another punk-sounding song. I don't know what the criteria for \\"punk\\" are. But I do know what I like: catchy music that doesn't make my ears bleed from utter lack of hook. A song without a hook is like a movie that shows a man reading a phone book for two hours.  <br /> <br />I paid no attention when this album came out, mainly because I happened to miss out on the radio play. I've always liked what I have heard of Green Day's songs, but I wasn't too familiar with them. Then the melodic and catchy \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" caught my attention one day on TV, and from there I was hooked. \\"American Idiot\\" is not a good single to judge the album by; at first listen, it might just seem like \\"noise\\" to the uninitiated. But after listening to \\"Boulevard,\\" I got the \\"pattern\\" with which Green Day works. This album is full of songs with plenty of hook if you just open your mind a little, including, but not limited to, \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" (which really showcases Bille Joe Armstrong's idiosyncratic, I've-got-a-sinus-problem-but-it's-sexy voice), \\"Give Me Novacaine\\" (another slow but catchy song in the same vein as \\"Boulevard\\"), \\"Whatsername\\" (which is reminiscent of Everclear due to the steady, rhythmic guitars, except better in every single conceivable way), and the upbeat \\"Holiday\\" (most similar to \\"American Idiot\\" in its pace and style).  <br /> <br />This album is a departure from Green Day's younger days, but it's not necessarily a bad thing. Artists should grow, letting their music mature without losing their audience by trying to be too \\"serious\\" (i.e., boring). Is Green Day trying too hard to be rebellious? Is the political slant distracting and unnecessary? Even as gimmicky as the eyeliner Billie Joe has been sporting lately? The answer may be \\"yes\\" to all these, but all thatmatters to many listeners is this question: \\"Are the songs good?\\" Many will offer a resounding \\"yes!\\" Green Day has definitely earned some new fans with this album.
B0006399FS|2.0|While the U2 of old broke new barriers with their landmark albums, on HTDAAB they are content to offer a second-grade rehash of their 80's works. To be honest, the first time I played this, I thought I was listening to a recording of some comedians on a sketch show doing an imitation of U2.  <br /> <br />Innovation is non-existent here. Cliche, boring and unfocused. The quality of all the songs on this disc would not get any other band in the world recorded by a hobby label. The attempt to update their used 'classic' sound became more important than making good music, and it resulted in songs that sound amateur and dated. Unlistenable commercial garbage. The lyrics are embarrassing and the vocals are far too poorly strained. <br />U2 now slaves to mass media (have you seen the ridiculously stupid videos for the horrific new singles?) make Christina Aguilera seem like Aretha Franklin if you get my drift.  <br /> <br />I give this 2 stars because this isn't their worst album ever - that's ATYCLB - but it ranks below U2 80's and 90's standards. But don't forget U2 now show just another level of selling out.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006J28L4|4.0|Born of trouble, snubbed by the Oscars and faded from memories, Spike Lee's \\"Malcolm X\\" thunders back in a DVD set keyed to the 40th anniversary of its subject's death. The film did a better job of selling \\"X\\" hats than cinema tickets upon release in 1992, partly because of its running time of about 3 1/2 hours. Lee's \\"labor of love\\" feels at home on DVD, where viewers can pause on any of the film's organic chapter breaks, delineated by cinematographer Ernest Dickerson's dramatic shifts in visual style.<br /><br />The film comes remastered on the DVD, with generous and to-the-point extras. The feature stretches over both discs. Audio and widescreen images are first class, with almost no signs of wear or damage. (The DVD set replaces a vanilla single-disc version released five years ago.)<br /><br />Lee's stylish and eclectic vision holds up well, but Denzel Washington's performance as the polarizing black activist of the 1960s remains the reason to revisit \\"Malcolm X.\\" Washington's portrayal is \\"one of the best in American movies,\\" Martin Scorsese maintains in the DVD extras.<br /><br />The extent to which Washington embodied his character becomes clear while viewing the DVD set's other outstanding Malcolm X film, the documentary of the same name from 1972.  The film relies on audio from Malcolm X's speeches for most of its narrative drive. There's no political correctness on display here, only the raw emotions of the era. \\"The devil is the white man,\\" Malcolm X informs his audience. \\"By nature he is evil.\\"<br /><br /> Lee enthusiastically introduces a handful of deleted scenes he said he didn't remember shooting. (\\"The DVD is one of the best things to ever happen to directors,\\" he said.) One great scene shows Malcolm X toying with an overeager volunteer. \\"People don't realize, he had a great sense of humor,\\" Lee said.<br /><br />Joining the director on the commentary are longtime collaborators Dickerson, editor Barry Alexander Brown and costume designer Ruth Carter. Their talks were recorded separately and edited together reasonably well, but there are awkward moments -- as when Lee says something profound about Malcolm X's legacy and Dickerson immediately begins talking about light bulbs. The commentary rarely drags, and Dickerson and Carter make good use of the opportunity to address the specifics of their crafts.Ruth Carter.

B000001E18|5.0|It goes without saying that when you release an era-defining album following it up can be something of a challenge. Still, Zooropa wasn't just U2's profile that saw this album shift far more copies than you would have expected for such a complex release and it is their ability to produce material like this - utterly complex and dauntingly intellectual but still melodic and resonant - that really sets them apart from the likes of U2 2000 with their pitiful 'ability' to write nice hit and miss songs as 'Beautiful Day' or 'Vertigo'. <br /> <br />The overall atmosphere of the album is pretty different than Achtung Baby. It's a defiantly anti-commercial album. The fact that it does defy convention and escape classification is a great achievement in itself. Are 'Numb', 'Lemon' or 'The Wanderer' a U2 songs ?... yes they are !.  <br /> <br />The album as a whole stands out as their second - Pop was the first - most complex and inaccessible release to date.  <br />
B00062IVKS|5.0|Martin Scorsese's black-and-white film, an underdog in its day and a classic today, makes a rousing comeback in this double-disc set from MGM. All of the key participants return with blow-by-blow accounts of making the movie, including a repentant Jake La Motta. The DVD can go toe-to-toe with Warner's great \\"Goodfellas\\" DVD.<br /><br /> Extras dig deep into Scorsese's methods and motivations, drawing heavily on the observations of Thelma Schoonmaker, his longtime editor who won an Oscar for the film. One of the DVD's best extras is a featurette in which Schoonmaker sits at her editing bay, breaking down the fight scenes, running film backward and forward as Robert De Niro does battle with the real-life boxers he faced during filming. The old champ La Motta says he went \\"a thousand\\" rounds with De Niro in preparation for filming. \\"I'm positive he could have fought professionally,\\" La Motta says.<br /><br />A short but telling extra shows how carefully Scorsese and De Niro followed the script from La Motta's real fights. The 3-minute \\"Shot for Shot\\" intercuts footage from the actual and movie fights, the drama heightened by Frank Warner's jungle-beast sound effects from \\"Raging Bull.\\"<br /><br />The DVD's widescreen anamorphic images (1.85:1) look sensational, with concussion blacks and silky grays across a distinct scale. The Dolby Digital (5.1) sounds all right, with plenty of punch, but requires some bobbing and weaving with the volume control to catch all of the dialog but not be blasted out in louder moments.<br /><br />Most viewers will be satisfied with the film's history as told on disc 2's quartet of featurettes directed by Laurent Bouzereau. They're solid pieces, but viewers may tire of sitting through opening titles and end credits as they navigate the short films, obviously separated at birth. De Niro participates in the featurettes, not the commentaries.<br /><br />Scorsese and Schoonmaker's commentary will be familiar to owners of \\"Raging Bull\\" laserdiscs. Their talks were recorded separately, and include some lengthy silences, but there's no shortage of content or insight.<br /><br />There are three commentary tracks. A lot of material gets repeated across the hours of extras presented here, and in one or two cases audio comments seem simply ported over to the featurettes.

B000001EAQ|5.0|Pop is not just the intellectual and innovative art-rock arrangements that inspire awe but the songwriting as a whole is unbelievably strong. It is nowhere near as immediately accessible as ATYCLB or HTDAAB, but when you do take the time to perceive beyond the technical intracies you are confronted with a wealth of atmospheric and unforgettable melodies.  <br /> <br />'Gone', 'Mofo', 'Discotheque', 'Last Night On Earth', 'Do You feel Loved', 'Please', 'Staring At The Sun', etc all feature peerless melodies that are easily the match of the mainstream commercial corporate sellout \\"Rock\\" of ATYCLB and HTDAAB. <br /> <br />'Please', 'Wake Up Dead Man' and 'If You Were That Velvet Dress' are beyond perfect and help give this album a unique and innovative ambience of technological isolation and emotional numbness.  <br /> <br />This album is balanced further between the songs that embellish the atmosphere with urban arrangements, such as the suicidal 'Mofo' and the claustrophobic 'Gone' and the more straight-forward Rock songs that did well enough as singles to establish U2 as one of the biggest bands on the planet at that time.  <br />
015670160X|3.0|Virginia Woolf's \\"Orlando\\" is unique in form, being a mock biography of a fictional character. We are introduced to Orlando, a protagonist based partly on Woolf's close friend Vita Sackville-West, as a 16-year-old boy, the son of noble parents, in the latter years of the reign of Queen Elizabeth I. By the end of the book, more than three hundred years later, he has become a 36-year-old woman living in \\"modern\\" times (meaning 1928, the year of publication).<br /><br />Woolf uses Orlando's sexual transformation and long life as a vehicle for investigating influences on and consequences of gender and sexuality through history. Her commentary is pointed and often right on the mark. But at the same time, the book is infused with Woolf's dry wit, giving everything a humorous overtone. For example, when Orlando returns to England after his transformation, everyone at home assuming him to be dead, she finds herself embroiled in a legal battle to get her property back: \\"The chief charges against her were (1) that she was dead, and therefore could not hold any property whatsoever; (2) that she was a woman, which amounts to much the same thing\\" (168). One can tell that, while these issues were obviously important to her, Woolf was having fun when she wrote this.<br /><br />Now, as far as my personal reaction, I am going to be among the minority of reviewers here in saying that overall I really didn't much care for the book. In talking to others who have read it, I've noticed that \\"Orlando\\" seems to be one of those \\"love it or hate it\\" works. Perhaps I went into it with the wrong expectaions, this being my first Woolf novel, but it just kind of fell flat for me. I certainly wasn't expecting it to be the kind of book it was. Thinking it was going to be a historical fiction piece with a serious tone, I found it to be much more like a more emotional version of \\"Candide.\\" Much of it is farcical, and certainly far from being believable.<br /><br />Though Woolf makes some very insightful and worthwhile social commentary here, her presentation, I felt, detracted from its impact. The fantasy-world feel that permeates much of it makes it seem unreal, and therefore less applicable to our own world. In addition, the narrative tone changes from time period to time period, which makes the book feel disjointed. Just as you get used to one style - BAM! - it changes to a different tone and you're left feeling disoriented all over again. And furthermore, Orlando her/himself doesn't feel like a real person. No matter how much I tried, I couldn't empathize with her/him. All of this, I found, got in the way of the actual story and its intended impact.<br /><br />In summary, I do commend Woolf's experimentation in style, and as I noted the underlying messages are important, but overall the book just wasn't as strong as it could have been. If you're a fan of Woolf, go ahead and give it a try. You may well find that you like it after all. But if you like more reality-rooted and tonally serious stories, this probably won't leave you very satisfied. Try it, but calibrate your expectations first.al commentary here, her presentation, I felt, detracted from its impact.

Dave Brubeck, is of course, a formidable jazz artist whose \\"Take Five\\" is positively essential for budding jazz artists.<br /><br />We had just upgraded our stereo system which now plays the super audio CDs.  To say I was floored is a masterpiece of understatement.<br /><br />The sound is quite simply phenomenal.  Moreover, while this was released in the early 60s, the material here is timeless and beautifully performed.  This is an excellent reminder of the caliber of musicianship that was Dave Brubeck's.  This set is filled with rapturous piano performances that jazz aficianados will readily and eternally appreciate!<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend!!!!
B0006GAOBI|2.0|'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut' (2005) offers audiences a restructured vision of the extraordinary 2001 Richard Kelly film, which stands with 'Haxan' (1922), 'Freaks' (1932), 'I Walked With A Zombie' (1942), 'Beauty And The Beast' (1947), 'Curse of the Demon' (1958), 'Eyes Without A Face' (1960), 'The Innocents' (1961), 'Carnival of Souls' (1962), 'The Birds' (1963), 'Blue Velvet' (1985), and 'Faust' (1994) as one of the greatest fantastic films ever created.<br /><br />Sadly, the revision, however more closely it may dovetail with Kelly's personal vision, considerably dilutes the film's drama and power on almost every level.<br /><br />While the theatrical release was fueled by its own judicious editing, structural hard edges, glorious ambiguities, and evocation of the suburban weird, the so-called director's cut continually literalizes the plot while simultaneously altering the status of essential story elements.<br /><br />In a grave error of judgement, the daimonic rabbit Frank, a dominant presence in and the very symbol of the theatrical release, is now overshadowed by Roberta Sparrow's previously obscure book, The Philosophy of Time Travel, which is brazenly promoted into the foreground. Additional superfluous scenes of the Darko family interacting (which were wisely included as outtakes only in the original DVD) undercut the film' pivotal forward momentum, while the deletion of some of the mean-spirited dialogue Donnie's peers direct towards one another weakens the satiric and parodic humor of the original.<br /><br />Key characters, like the free thinking, anti-establishment teacher beautifully portrayed by Drew Barrymore, now seem to have briefly wandered in from another film entirely.<br /><br />Awash in new CGI effects, the director's cut should make more logical sense, but simply does not. The film's last ten minutes, in which everything that has gone before coalesces into terrible meaning, should have been considered sacrosanct and left unaltered.<br /><br />As a result of these changes and others, a clever, multi-faceted, fairly original, and genuinely tragic film has become a muddy, unfocused, and protracted exercise in the unthreatening and the banal.<br /><br />So in a reversal of several well-documented Orson Welles projects, including 'The Magnificent Ambersons' (1942), and the plot of Woody Allen's 'Stardust Memories' (1980), 'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut' is a concrete example in which the much-maligned Hollywood executive machine has actually strengthened a creative work through forcible tampering.<br /><br />For the film's reputation to continue to flourish, it is essential that the theatrical version remain in circulation; the obvious choice here would have been to include the mediocre director's cut in addition to the theatrical release.<br /><br />Bonus \\"special features,\\" such as \\"They Made Me Do It--The Cult of Donnie Darko\\" and \\"Number One Fan--A Darkomentary,\\" are third rate, futile studies in self-applause and package padding which further embarrass the project as a whole./><br />As a result of these changes and others, a clever, multi-faceted, fairly original, and genuinely tragic film has become a muddy, unfocused, and protracted exercise in the unthreatening and the banal.<br /><br />So in a reversal of several well-documented Orson Welles projects, including 'The Magnificent Ambersons' (1942), and the plot of Woody Allen's 'Stardust Memories' (1980), 'Donnie Darko: The Director's Cut' is a concrete example in which the much-maligned Hollywood executive machine has actually strengthened a creative work through forcible tampering.<br /><br />For the film's reputation to continue to flourish, it is essential that the theatrical version remain in circulation; the obvious choice here would have been to include the mediocre director's cut in addition to the theatrical release.<br /><br />Bonus \\"special features,\\" such as \\"They Made Me Do It--The Cult of Donnie Darko\\" and \\"Number One Fan--A Darkomentary,\\" are third rate, futile studies in self-applause and package padding which further embarrass the project as a whole.

B0002O06N0|5.0|I grew up on \\"alternative\\" grunge rock, and industrial music.  But as I get into my mid-20's, I've been obsessed with listening to better quality music.  This means rock and roll that was meant to rock.  I've gone through a phase where I couldn't get enough of rockabilly, and now I'm into garage rock, and The Black Keys is just what I needed.  This is the rock that made my head jerk up and listen, and did the same to my dad, and he said it was the same pleasure he derived when he first heard Led Zeppelin in high school.  This is as pure as it can get, and man I'm so glad to discover this band.  Driving, energetic, powerful, and fantastic direct lyrics.  There's no filler here, there's no fancy studio tricks, no lip-syncing, just honest to God rock.

B00003CXD5|5.0|One of the things that makes this classic so appealing to me is the way Bogey's portrayal of Dobbs gradually reveals himself as the personification of the Bible verse:  \\"For the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil\\" (I Timothy 6:10).  The film opens with Dobbs as a sympathetic character, way down on his luck.  He bumps into Tim Holt, a fellow American stuck in Mexico without a job or a way home, and in the course of their misadventures they hook up with an old prospector and eventually make a quite decent haul in the mountains.  Dobbs's excessive paranoia mars their stay, but he's shown to be wrong and he is shamed....for awhile.  His character eventually gives in to all of its demons, and the unraveling is quite something to behold, the mastery of Bogey working in concert with the mastery of director/screenwriter John Huston to an extent that shines through in almost all of their collaborations over the years.    For all the power of the early scenes in the flophouses and bars of Tampico, as well as those of the gritty, sweaty drama in the mountains, this film earns its fifth star of my 5-star rating in its final act, when the trio of nouveau riche prospectors begin their return to civilization.  There are several ironic twists of fate that take place as the story unravels to its satisfying conclusion.    Finally, a sixth star could be rated to Warner Home Video for treating this masterpiece with the respect it deserves.  With documentaries, old and new, as well as pleasant surprises like the cartoons and audio track of a radio play version, they have ensured that \\"Treasure Of the Sierra Madre\\" will continue to hold a very special place in movie history.  Well worth watching and rewatching, even for those of us whose parents were kids when it came out.  Most excellent.    Footnote in the interest of accuracy:  The famous line \\"We don't need no stinking badges\\" is never uttered.  As with the famous non-line \\"Play it again, Sam,\\" from another great Bogey picture, the actual line has been truncated over the years.  The line is actually \\"We ain't got no badges!  We don't need no badges!  I don't have to show you any stinking badges!\\"  (In \\"Casablanca,\\" Bogey's line is \\"If you can play it for her, you can play it for me.  Now, play it.\\")    Quick trivia that explains some continuity problems:  Censors would not allow the inclusion of a second shot fired by Dobbs in an attempt on the life of one of his cohorts, which explains why we only hear one gunshot but the other character later says he was shot twice.  Also, when the bandits catch up to Dobbs near the film's end they chop his head off with a machete; again, a bit too much for the censors of the day, which explains why we see the same bandit coming around the same burro twice and delivering the same blow.  Looks like deja vu; this was done to cover up the fact that Huston was not allowed to show a decapitation.  A \\"Director's Cut\\" would cure these imperfections, but trimmed footage is probably not available almost 60 years after it was shot, and after all this time these historical footnotes just add to the character of the film.

However, this powermetal thing (or whatever you want to call it) just makes me cringe. Tolkein makes poor fodder for rock n' roll...including Led Zepplin and my all time favorite band Pink Floyd ( ala Syd Barret era). <br />I was excited when I first bought this album. I even bought the German version before it was even released in the US. When I put it in my player, I was sorely disappointed.

I've listened to it at least 8 times through now hoping I will pick up something new but its just not clicking. Its grown on me enough now that I realize it is an good album that has many positive qualities :  <br /> <br />1. Amazing harmonies that have never been repeated by another band  <br />2. God Only Knows is one of the best songs of all-time in my book <br />3. One of the most influential albums of all-time <br />4. this album is ridiculously trippy <br /> <br />but it also has negative qualities <br />1. so many of the songs sound so similar its hard to distinguish them apart. it starts w/ track 1 Wouldn't it be Nice...a classic pop song that will never be band.  <br />track 2 You Stil believe it me ..slow paced song but very beautiful sounding <br />track 3 That's not Me.. same <br />track 4 Don't Talk ... The first time i listened to this cd it went thru tracks #2, 3, and 4 and I dint even realize the song had changed...hmmm <br />track 5 I'm Waiting for the Day ...Finally a change of pace..One of the best on the album <br />track 6 Let's go away for awhile ...nice instrumental <br />track 7 Sloop John B - not bad..i think this song is really about a bad acid trip that brian had <br />track 8 God Only Knows - one of the best and most beautiful songs of all-time..easily the best on the album <br />track 9 I Know there's an answer - great song. great lyrics <br />track 10 Here Today - solid song..little hoppier then most songs on Pet Sounds <br />track 11 I Just Wasn't made for these Times - negative lyrics but still a catchy song to chill too <br />track 12 Pet Sounds - AWESOME.. great instrumental <br />track 13 Caroline No- what is the big fuss about this song?? I dont know..the random sounds at the end are good though <br /> <br />Good album w/ highlights like God Only Knows, Pet Sounds and I'm Waiting for the Day. But LIke 6 of thesongs aren't even distinguishible from each other.  <br /> <br />Good Album - YES <br />Best of all-time - no way - in the top 25 but not close to # 1 <br /> <br />There are so many classic albums that are better then this album <br />The Beatles - White Album, Sgt.

0575074361|4.0|Not revelation space. This starts with a genuine puzzle: humanity on earth has been wiped out hundreds of years ago. But contemporaneously a strange murder case needs solving in Paris, France. It's not time-travel or a parallel universe, so how can this be? Rather deus ex machina is the answer, but this is just background to the plot!<br /><br />The Paris detective stuff is really not bad: believable characterisation, trademark snappy dialogue and organic plot development. Genuinely page-turning stuff.<br /><br />At the half-way point it's all change, however. We get into an extended hi-tech chase sequence and the plot development stalls. The editor should have been harsher here. More serious is the collapse of plot credibility. Why would the \\"extremist slashers\\" want to unleash their genocidal plan on E2? Both revenge and the quest for real-estate are equally implausible as motivations. And the ending is scrappy.<br /><br />A shame really - this had potential for audience crossover, but SF folk will like it, even those who hang out at /.
B00000253N|5.0|It took afew listens for me for the gems on this album to shine. It was not until I really sat down and appreciated the lyrics that I realised what a truly great album Blood On The Tracks is, and like albums that grow on you, you never get sick of it.  <br /> <br />Every song on this album shines. Other reviewers have dealt with them so I won't bore you with repetitions, but there is one thing I do want to say..... <br /> <br />Unlike other reviewers I love the oft cited \\"weak\\" song \\"Lilly, Rosemary...etc.\\" Though on first listen it seems lighthearted, perhaps because it is rooted in the mythic \\"wild west\\" mieleu Dylan drew inspiration from for \\"Patt Garret & Billy the Kid,\\" in my opinion it is far from being a throwaway. The characters have considerable depth... more, in fact, than most characters in western films. Only Dylan would have thought of giving them universally relevant backgrounds and life experiences (broken homes, suicide attempts etc.) Like the other songs on the album, its theme is loss. The image of Lilly \\"comb(ing) all the dye out of her hair\\" after the \\"Jack of Hearts\\" has left her is moving, as is Rosemary's sacrifice on the gallows.   <br />  As I'm a spaghetti western fan I can't help loving this song, but those of you who've critcised it, give it another spin and shut your eyes, visualise, and enjoy the story. I don't think its out of place. In my opinion serves as a foil and counterweight to the more introspective songs.

B0000013GT|5.0|This album is one of my favorite albums of any genre. ATLiens captures Dre and Big Boi as they began to hit their creative stride. forget all those whack mcs and so called 'artist' (50, The Game, etc.) that MTV and BET keep force feeding the masses and pick up an album with tight beats and real rhymes that people, regardless of skin type and background can relate to. (By the way, aqumini ain't too bad either.)

0061015725|5.0|Jack Forman, a stay-at-home dad has a problem. His wife, a scientist and psychologist appears to be cheating on him.  But is she really, or are things quite what they seem at the Zymos plant?<br /><br />I really enjoyed Prey- I especially found it refreshing that the main character was a stay-at-home dad. This role-reversal was fun and refreshing. I especially LOVED the first 3/4's of this novel. The ending seemed.... Rushed, and I felt that Jack didn't seem to care that much for his wife. Also, I never really understood the 'swarm's motivation.' I would've liked to have understood it better, especially in regards to Julia's involvement with it. How much control did the swarm possess?<br /><br />Overall, this was a superb book that kept me on the edge of my seat! I sincerely hope there is a sequel. We never did find out why the sprinklers didn't work!
B0002X314C|5.0|Hopefully, this album with be the start of a long career for John Legend. He's got major talent and a strong voice to go along with it. There aren't too many R&B singers making an album like this anymore. Better get this one because it's got classic written all over it. Will John Legend rise to the status that his last name has so boldly estimated? We'll have to wait and see. But we can certainly hope that he does. With some people you can just tell by the sound of their voice, their music, they way they put their words together that the result is going to be something special. And with John Legend, those are the circumstances. Please take the time to listen to this album. This is music that you don't want to miss.
B000007MVU|4.0|The fact that Ringo Starr is often deemed \\"the luckiest man in show business\\" for having joined the Beatles shortly before they were to start conquering the world is quite an apt one. As Ringo himself often claimed, he was never the cracker-jack songwriters his 3 fellow Beatles were (John & Paul were already wonderful, while George struggled a bit before becoming a fabulous songwriter), and often relied on them to write songs for Ringo to sing on Beatles' albums to compensate for his unique, limited voice. When the Beatles disbanded, Ringo was fearful of the future without guys like them to help him along. So when he began work on his first solo album, he opted to go a sort of safe route by covering the classics, songs that were popular before or just after he was born. Hence, 1970's SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY.<br /><br />Ringo wanted to record the album for his parents and relatives, who were always proud of his success, and wanted to pay them back for inspiring his love of music. While Ringo would often call on his former Beatle mates & other famous friends to help him record future efforts, SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY only features a cast of thousands in the arranging department. All of them help a singer like Ringo wrap his voice around songs that may have been recorded numerous times before, but it is always interesting to see which singer is the one giving them a fresh face.<br /><br />The title track was the song that made Doris Day a huge star, and I'll bet she was proud to hear Ringo acquit himself well on here. The arranger of the moment is Richard Perry, who would graduate to producer on Ringo's first \\"original\\" solo albums 1973's RINGO & 1974's GOODNIGHT VIENNA. With the oodles of standards albums that came out last year, it is surprising this one was not as attempted so much as say \\"Night & Day\\" or \\"Stardust\\" (yes, Ringo would do those, too).<br /><br />Cole Porter's \\"Night & Day\\" was one of his most seductive works, and you would think that Fred Astaire owns this song & nobody else can touch it. Well, that is true in Ringo's case, but again, he does not embarrass himself at all, and with it being the first song he recorded for SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY, the tone was probably set for the rest of what came.<br /><br />\\"Whispering Grass [Don't Tell The Trees]\\" is a real diamond in the rough simply for it being one of the least-known tunes on the album. Because of this, Ringo actually manages to make this song one of his own, having a 36-piece orchestra behind him to help out. I wonder if the Ink Spots' original classic was what spurred Ringo to try this one.<br /><br />Joe Cocker had already done a distinctive version of Eddie Cantor's \\"Bye Bye Blackbird\\" the previous year, but Ringo still manages to do the same with a more traditional approach, banjo and all. However, the double-tracking of Ringo's voice does modernize the song a little bit, especially since such a recording trick was pure science-fiction in Cantor's day.<br /><br />Ted Daffan is one of country music's most underheralded personalities, having been a big star in the 1940s, back when it was still called \\"hillbilly music\\". He was also a fine songwriter, with \\"I'm A Fool To Care\\" being one of his jewels. Perhaps it was Les Paul & Mary Ford's hit recording that caught Ringo's ear, and encouraged him to try this country-tinged one on for size. Somehow, Ringo's offbeat voice is perfectly suited for this genre.<br /><br />Where to begin with \\"Stardust\\", that Hoagy Carmichael song that is truly the standard of standards? Surely, Ringo knew he would never steal this song from anyone, least of all, Nat King Cole, whom Hoagy claimed did it the best. However, Ringo has never tried to be earth-shattering with his music, just simply wanting to have fun. If that was the case with his \\"Stardust\\", mission accomplished. At least Ringo had Paul McCartney as the arranger in question, with more than a little help from producer George Martin.<br /><br />Fats Waller's \\"Blue, Turning Grey OverYou\\" is much more like it, with another lost classic of sorts, and a brassy, swinging approach that finds Ringo succeeding again beyond all expectations. Louis Armstrong had popularized this song, and seeing as he was still alive when Ringo recorded it, I wonder if he dug Ringo's cover of a truly forgotten classic.<br /><br />The Four Aces' \\"Love Is A Many-Splendored Thing\\" was one of Ringo's favorite songs growing up, as he mentioned in THE BEATLES ANTHOLOGY book, so recording this probably was a labor of love for him. With master producer & arranger Quincy Jones at the helm, Ringo again does his best to put his signature on it, getting some ample help from organist Billy Preston & a smaller 16-piece orchestra along the way.<br /><br />Ringo's delivery of \\"Good Night\\" on the WHITE ALBUM showed he could do the \\"Uncle Ringo\\" persona with a lullaby to soothe the listener on their way to dreamland. He does so again on Johnny Mercer's \\"Dream\\", which also seems to exemplify the easygoing nature of Ringo himself. Even with the Beatles becoming a thing of the past, Ringo could not have been that scared of what he was going to do next. Not when he had old friends like George Martin to arrange this classic.<br /><br />\\"You Always Hurt The One You Love\\" was co-written by Doris Fisher, who also collaborated on \\"Whispering Grass\\", and here Ringo gets a bit more melancholy with a song that is the polar opposite of the one coming after this. However, the much more upbeat instrumentation is rather jarring, making for an ill fit. Perhaps the only song on here that does not succeed totally.<br /><br />\\"Have I Told You Lately That I Love You?\\" is my favorite entry on SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY because, this time around, a peppy lyric is matched wonderfully with an equally-so arrangement by the late film composer Elmer Bernstein. Ringo's enthusiasm is beyond infectious, and I bet he enjoyed particularly the ending with the violin and bird noises. Cute!<br /><br />SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY then heads for home with \\"Let The Rest Of The World Go By\\", written by Ernest Ball of \\"When Irish Eyes Are Smiling\\" fame. Obviously, Ringo is no Dick Haymes, though they have similarly deep voices, but Ringo still creates an appropriate sense of contentment with a song again playing to his real-life happy-go-lucky attitude, albeit with a more sedate arrangement that still manages to fit.<br /><br />Ringo Starr would continue going the covers route on his follow-up of country greats BEAUCOUP OF BLUES (1970), so even if he was unsure of what to do after the four-headed monster of the Beatles separated, he was at least not going to stay idle. Although Ringo did begin work on his song \\"It Don't Come Easy\\" during the sessions with George Martin producing, that version remained unreleased, and when released as a single the next year, it would be a complete overhaul from what I have heard. While Ringo's post-Beatles solo career would not really get underway for 3 more years, SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY shows that Ringo was at least going to succeed on his enthusiasm and his aim to keep working somehow or another. In the end, I am sure Ringo's parents were prouder still to see their song sing the songs they enjoyed for a change.You\\" is much more like it, with another lost classic of sorts, and a brassy, swinging approach that finds Ringo succeeding again beyond all expectations.

B0006IUE3Y|2.0|I had read a bunch of online reviews that said this was a movie that was all \\"look\\" and little substance.  It's true.  The gauzy, sepia-toned computo-cinematography is equal parts Fritz Lang's Metropolis and cheesy sci-fi serialization.  It's thrilling to look at for the first few minutes, but once the torpor of the film becomes apparent, nothing really makes much of an impression.  It seems as if the stars -- Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow -- were instructed to behave as if they were actors in a low-budget '30s action serial, ie., to emote flatly and have delayed or muted reactions to any and all plot developments.  This, combined with the actual challenge of acting against a blue screen (where the actor is told what special effects will be doing, but can't actually see what will be onscreen in final print...), essentially sinks the film.  Overall, the movie is just plain unexciting -- the pacing is slow, the special effects are also held in check, presumably to mimic the stiff, ricketty charm of the serials.  Thus, robots clank past clumsily, stone walls fall to the ground as if made of molasses, airplanes move with mechanical deliberation... Why the director didn't just digitize in some fake \\"wires\\" to hold the models up is, honestly, a bit of a mystery to me.  The film is full of clever homages to classic films -- The Wizard Of Oz, Lost Horizon, every \\"girl reporter\\" film known to mankind, etc. -- but although it's clearly a labor of love on the part of director Kerry Conran, Sky Captain is essentially dull as dishwater.  It's a pity.  If they had injected just a modicum of excitment into the proceedings, this could have been a wonderful film.
B000002OX5|5.0|In the year of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper and the Rolling Stones' Satanic Majesties, this certainly wasn't the first concept album, but, released just two weeks before Christmas 1967, what a treat to find under the tree!  The Who Sell Out was 60s psychedelic pop-rock at its height, executed with great humor, inventiveness and devastating musicianship. <br /> <br />Themed around the then-booming offshore pirate radio stations that were blasting the music into Britain that the staid old BBC refused to play, Pete Townsend & Co. created their own commercials for deodorant, baked beans, guitar strings, (hoping for free product), body-building courses, nightclubs, acne treatments and more, all interspersed with \\"borrowed\\" pirate radio station IDs linking the album's songs proper.  Oddly, the jingles and ads disappeared about three-quarters of the way in, but the excellent remastered CD version adds extra songs and jingles, plus ads for Coke, the local Bag O' Nails pub and a car dealer, (Townsend hoping for a free car). <br /> <br />From the lysergic `Armenia City In The Sky' that opens, through the masturbatory `Mary Anne With The Shaky Hand', then `Odorono' and `Tattoo', the first fifteen minutes were mind-bogglingly wonderful.  `Our Love Was' provided a brief respite before the band, in full rock flight, kicked into `I Can See For Miles' - magic!  Towards the end Townsend indulged himself with the solo acoustic `Sunrise', before the mini rock-opera, `Rael', (possibly an oblique warning about the world being overrun by hoards of Communist Chinese). <br /> <br />The Who weren't this good again until 1971's Who's Next, and by then they were a very different band. <br /> <br />Kim Porter <br />Fort Magazine, Australia <br />
B0000C9JFO|4.0|First of all don't be mislead by the DVD Cover.  Although Audrey Tautou (Amelie) was used to boost this movie to American audiences she plays a minor role.   <br /> <br />I found the movie interesting however in how Europeans (as told from a Parisian French point of view) see themselves.  In applying to a graduate school in Barcelona ( part of the EU in which they use the same currency) you would think he was going to study on a different continent.  I mean what is it 400 or 500 miles to Barcelona? That's about the distance from San Franciso to Los Angeles.  Saying good-bye to his girlfriend (Tautau) Xavier sheds tears like  he is some modern day Columbus leaving for the new world.   <br /> <br />Having studied overseas in Japan I was amazed that my experience was far less complex and paperwork requirments were far more lax than what was required to study in a neigboring country.  However once arriving in Barcelona Xavier has to deal with an apartment full of one each of a Brit, German, Italian, Spanish,  Danish, and a Belgian Lesbian who gives him pointers on how to seduce women.  What was interesting was how they all find a lingua franca in which to communicate with. Of course the usual stereotypes appear; the comparison of a sloppy Italian student with the very precise and orderly German; the biggoted Brit doing Hitler impressions, and the proud Spaniard who screams that Spain is more than flamenco, Picasso, and happy people screaming Ole! <br /> <br />There is an overall story however; and that story is that in the end you must do what makes you happy. As for Xavier; being one tiny cog in the large French bereaucracy is not what he sees for his future.  An entertaining and quirky movie about how your Europeans view themselves and all of their differences.
0441003257|5.0|That's because Crowley is a demon.  \\"Cursing\\" under his breath doesn't offer a demon the emotional release the opposite expression would provide.  Crowley is one of The Two.  His opposite number, Azariphale, is an angel.  For six thousand years [Ussher missed the correct time of creation by fifteen minutes], they have wandered the planet awaiting the final encounter - Armageddon.  The arrival of the AntiChrist on Earth is what they've been preparing for.  Of course, it means both of them will thereby be laid off.  No more job.<br /><br />Pratchett and Gaiman's story of Christianity's two-millennia-long fulfillment episode is outstanding.  With their combined wit and inventiveness, \\"Good Omens\\" is at least a laugh per page.  A subset of humanity has blamed The Evil One for various wars, disasters and Labour governments.  Not so, according to Crowley, who should know.  Each time he thinks he's devised a truly fiendish torment to apply to humans, they've usually gotten in before him.  And exceeded his expectatations.  When it comes to vindictiveness, it seems nothing can outdo the human species.<br /><br />There's another side to humans, however.  It's sometimes discovered among children, who haven't learned the kinds of nastiness adults can develop.  Among the children of the remote British town of Tadfield is a four-member gang, the Them.  Three lads and a red-haired girl struggle to understand the adult world.  One of them, Adam, has a certain level of leadership.  He also has a dog - named \\"Dog\\".  A recent acquisition of Adam's, Dog has been developing a taste for rabbits, a novelty compared to his previous diet.<br /><br />Although the authors kindly provide a \\"Dramatis Personae\\" at the book's opening, listing various real and supernatural beings, one group enjoys a particular place in this book.  Witches have endured some interesting shifts in our history.  Where once they were dumped in the nearest scum-covered pond or fried upright bound to a post, now they have a new image.  Today it's health food, long beaded necklaces and ley lines.  Anathema Device, who may [or may not] be the descendent of Agnes Nutter, takes her role quite seriously.  After all, she has The Book.

Agnes foretold the future in astonishing detail and precision - a capacity surprising  Azariphale and occupying Anathema's time.<br /><br />Bringing all these disparate elements together seems an impossible task.

0393035158|3.0|...it was possible to be a fanatical atheist. Unfortunately, Sam Harris has shown me that it is possible.  <br /> <br />His attitude toward religion and religious belief is a rigid one, dependent on a narrow, black and white view. For one thing, he confuses fundamentalism with religious or spiritual belief. He cannot separate them and, indeed, insists they can't or shouldn't be separated. As the Amazon editorial review pointed out, this is naive and immature, although perhaps it would be more honest to call it arrogance.  <br /> <br />According to Harris, if you are a REAL Christian, you can't ever really respect people of another religion (because they don't believe Jesus is the messiah.)  <br /> <br />If you are a Muslim, there is no way you can endure torture and persecution without desiring violent vegeance (quite a generalization of a billion people!). If you are a Muslim who desires vengeance after persecution, it has to do with your religion and not your human nature. <br /> <br />And by the way, REAL Judaism is about following the Old Testament laws, like those about killing disobedient children and nonbelievers. Oh, and keeping slaves. <br /> <br />In truth, I find this narrow minded, uncompromising view of religion chilling. If taken seriously, it could provide for a rollback of centuries of painstakingly aquired religious tolerance and acceptance. <br /> <br />To put it another way: you can indeed respect other religions if you are a Christian, be a non-violent Muslim, and be a religious Jew without practicing Old Testament brutality. <br /> <br />I believe Harris' view comes primarily from fear, which is understandable. Violent fundamentalists of many kinds are a danger in the world today. However, the answer is not an answering fundamentalist atheism. <br /> <br />Indeed, societies that try to forcibly elimate religious expression rarely succeed and are indeed unhappy places (see Communist Russia; see also the history of any religious minority driven underground). It is too deeply enmeshed in human culture, identity and psyche, not to mention spirituality. There is a reason America was founded on freedom of religion. <br /> <br />In short, throwing out religious respect and tolerance is indeed throwing out the baby with the bathwater. <br /> <br />
B0001N9ZKW|5.0|In our age of hyped-up folkrock artists like Ryan Adams and Bright Eyes, it is a real eye-opener to listen to this album. The music lingers in the borderland between traditional english and american music, giving it a really original flavour.  <br /> <br />The opener, the transcendent \\"When I get to the border\\" is probably the best \\"new\\"(to me) song I`ve heard so far this year, totally unpretentious and original and free. Like Bob Dylan, Richard Thompson attempts & fails to conceal an amazing personality and individuality which seeps through every breath of his vocal work. The same goes for the rest of the album.  <br /> <br />Linda`s vocals are a little less original, but more than adequate compared to other singers, and anyway, the imperfections of this album adds up to become perfection as a whole.The title song, for example: A rambunctious, messy, drunken, glorious thing, complete with a marching band and a primitive bassline, totally irresistible. If you`ve heard \\"The basement tapes\\", you`ll know what I mean.  <br /> <br />Strongly recommended.
B0006SSOHC|2.0|...we're all in some serious trouble.     As a huge fan of horror films for years, I was very excited to (finally) see \\"Saw\\" when it made it out on DVD. A compelling sereal killer, some graphic violence, that creepy laughing clown ... how could you go wrong?    For starters, the acting is awful. It's sad to watch Cary Elwes absolutely mail in a performance like this - he had such verve and charisma in \\"The Princess Bride,\\" but here he seems very ill-suited and even a little bored. Leigh Whannell is only slightly more convincing as his cell-mate. Danny Glover is Danny Glover. He's an effective character actor, and he could have been used to much greater effect here.     Then the directing. This might just be my personal taste, but the nonstop MTV type sound blurts and quick-cut camera effect is badly overused in many movies, and it seems particularly inappropriate for the horror genre. It's been done before, and in \\"Saw\\" it manages to crush any atmosphere or suspense.     And finally, the plot. \\"Saw\\" clearly draws its inspiration from \\"Seven,\\" with a little bit of \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" \\"The Cell\\" and \\"The Usual Suspects\\" thrown in for good measure. The movie makes the mistake of being far more clever than it needs to be - tacking on badly contrived and unlikely twists to an already shaky plot.     Note to Hollywood directors: A \\"twist\\" is only satisfying if it makes logical sense within the context of the picture. When you pull some minor non-character out of a totally unrelated scene and make him the most important player in the movie for no other reason than to surprise the audience, we won't care. And I didn't.     But what annoyed me most about \\"Saw\\" was its self-serious attitude. A less proficient director probably could've turned this material into cheesy high camp. Instead, \\"Saw\\" is so heavy-handed and devoid of fun that I seriously considered turning it off midway through.     Two stars for some graphic violence, a rarity in mainstream horror films these days. I'd have given it 2 1/2 if we were treated to some pointless nudity (sadly, everybody keeps their clothes on).
0812548094|2.0|Good God and there are six more?  When I signed up for the Sci-Fi book club several years ago I received the first four books in the Sword of Truth series.  The Sci-Fi book club just raved about them being the next great epic fantasy to rival Tolkien.  I should have remembered that job one of the book club is to SELL books.  Letting it's potential members know their selections were coma inducing would not have been good for business.  I managed to get through the first book and since I had the nect three I figured I should read them.  Well, the second was as far as I got and I ended up trading them all in at a used book store without ever opening up books three and four.<br /><br />To Briefly summarize, Richard and Kahlan, easily the most lackluster characters to ever see print in a fantasy, are back.  Richard is having trouble controling his powers and is getting bad headaches (although I bet they were nothing compared to the ones I got trying to get through this).  The Sisters of Light, a Quasi-Religious group of fanatics who train wizards offer to help.  Well, not really offer, more or less force themselve on Richard.  Meanwhile Kahlan is off to the Council of the Midlands, dodging all sorts of trouble along the way including a prophecy that she must be executed.<br /><br />And thus the bulk of the tale becomes these separate, long, ponderous Journies with a lot of muck about prophesies.  Goodkind certainly loves to see his words in print that's for sure.  Never was so many pages spent accomplishing so little.  I didn't care much for the characters in the first book but now I basically despise both of them.<br /><br />The only way I would recommend this book is if you have a sleep disorder...or need a good paperweight.
B0001ZMWQO|4.0|Franz Ferdinand seems to be one of those anti-pop bands, a notion that is especially evidenced by the fact that the liner notes show neither the band members' names nor what respective instruments they play.

Their debut full-length, self-titled album brought forth that popularity, but it also brought some criticism: several people label the band as a rip-off band (although it would be a little more understandable if they pointed out just WHOM they're ripping off).<br /><br />Franz Ferdinand may be classified as indie rock, but to me they're more like indie rock with a hint of new wave flavor; see especially \\"The Dark of the Matinee\\" (side note to the lyric transcriber: \\"matinee\\" doesn't have an accent on either \\"e\\"). Anyway, there are other great songs on here like \\"This Fire\\" and \\"Jacqueline\\". And as far as my favorite song, well, I'm still debating between \\"Take Me Out\\" and \\"Auf Achse\\".<br /><br />I'm not homophobic, but \\"Michael\\" still didn't really do anything for me (not that it's a bad song). The only song on here I really didn't care for was \\"Cheating On You\\". Everything else is fine, although most people probably won't want to pay full price for an album that's under forty minutes in length. Anyway, if you don't often listen to indie rock, it might take you a while to get into this, but for everyone else, Franz Ferdinand's album should fit in well with your Beck, Modest Mouse and Snow Patrol albums.<br /><br />Anthony Rupert
B0006SSOHC|4.0|As a fan of the horror genre who reads a lot of industry magazines, I had read a great deal about this film long before it even hit theatres.  It eventually turned out to be a far different film that I ever thought, being far more of a psychological thriller than the crazed, serial/slasher film that it seemed to be advertised as being.<br /><br />Saw opens with two men, Adam (Leigh Whannell) and Dr. Lawrence Gordon (Cary Elwes) being held captive in a dingy, grimy, foul, and mold infested bathroom.  The bathroom from hell, literally.  They are both chained by the ankle to pipes at opposite ends of the bathroom, neither one knowing how they got there or why.  Between them lies a corpse, dead of a self-inflicted gunshot to the head.  They each find a micro-cassette in their pocket as a voice ridicules them as to the reason they are held captive.  Gordon is told he must kill Adam by 6:00 or his wife and child will be killed.  They also find two hacksaws...too weak to cut through their chains, Gordon realizes they are for cutting through their own ankles if the want to be free.<br /><br />Through flashbacks told by Gordon, we learn of a maniac called the Jigsaw killer.  He plays a deadly game with people, putting them in horrific traps with a small chance of escape where they usually end up killing themselves.  But who is he and why is he doing this?  We learn that Gordon himself was a suspect and investigated by detectives including Tapp (Danny Glover).  Tapp eventually is dismissed from the force when he becomes obsessed with Gordon after his partner is killed by the Jigsaw Killer.<br /><br />Saw is a heavy-handed thriller/horror.  The killer has his warped, moralistic reasons for doing what he does such as trapping a prostitute in a mask that will rip her face apart unless she locates the key for the trap inside the stomach of a corpse.  The Killer seemingly goes after victims who don't have a greater appreciation for life and this does somewhat give away a major plot surprise as James Wan simply was not subtle enough to handle it more deftly.<br /><br />Elwes and Whannell give fine performances as the two men driven to the edge of sanity by their ordeal and one wishes that more time was spent building the tension between the two, rather than with so many flashback scenes.  It is in this dark, dank cell where the movie is at it's best.  Being in a place like this would make anyone cringe and run screaming.  Being held captive there would be one's own private hell.<br /><br />If SaW is guilty of one thing it's perhaps that it tries to be a little to clever for its own good.  It tries to throw a few too many curve balls at viewers to throw them off the track but in doing so, allows one to basically eliminate every character from suspicion out of general principle.  And of course there's little doubt that the film was made with the idea of a sequel already planned.<br /><br />An effective thriller, more for the mood and settings than for the actual plot, but a well done effort.or plot surprise as James Wan simply was not subtle enough to handle it more deftly. <br /> <br />Elwes and Whannell give fine performances as the two men driven to the edge of sanity by their ordeal and one wishes that more time was spent building the tension between the two, rather than with so many flashback scenes.

6305327041|4.0|The movie starts with a bellhop starting his shift. He is the night bellhop in what seems to be a high class hotel. He is the only one working that night and has to contend with four different roooms (not all at the same time) which is where the name comes from. Each room has its own segment and is written by a different writer. The first two I don't remember who did them, but the last two are done by Robert Rodriguez(#3) and Quentin Tarintino(#4). <br />Now that all of the rooms are fun to watch. The first room is horrible and contains one of the worst actresses in the world, Maddona. Stay away from this room and don't bother watching it. Basically it features a group of witches attempting to resurrect their leader. They all bring different items but one of them doesn't. She needed to bring sperm but didn't, so guess who is going to give them some? That's right the bellhop. She doesn't want to take advantage of him but is forced to. There is some nudity in this scene(and it is a beautiful women who is nude) but that would be the only reason to watch this scene, and I say just fast forward until you get to it. <br />The second room contains a couple who are in the middle of a major conflict. The bellhop walks into the room to find the husband with a gun and the wife tied up. The husband is accusing the bellhop of committing adultery with his wife. He denies it and they go back and force. The bellhop gains his trust then loses it, and back and force like that. It was quite funny but not my favorite. <br />The third room contains Antonio Banderas(I don't think I spelled his name right) and an actress playing his wife. They want to go out but they have two childen, a young son and older daughter. These two children are trouble and you can tell from the moment they appear on the screen. Now in order to get away from their children they pay the bellhop to check on them every hour. The parents leave, mischief occurs, children don't listen, and more mischief happens. Lovedthis scene, one of Robert Rodriguez's greatest works. The only thing of his I liked more was From Dusk til' Dawn. <br />Then there is an intermission where the bellhop complains to the pothead manager of the hotel, who is played hilariously by Kathy Griffin. Good break up from the rooms that perfectly sets up the final and greatest room of the movie. <br />The final room was written and stars Quetin Tarintino. Quentin plays a famous actor who rented the penthouse with a bunch of his friends. They are drunk and bored and asked the bellhop for what seems to be a bunch of random items. When he delivers these he is instantly greeted by a drunk and merry Quentin. He invites him to drink a little with him and another of his friends, while Bruce Willis argues with his wife on the phone in the bedroom. Eventually he asks to the bellhop to help out in an outrageous bet with crazy circumstances(don't want to give it away) and the bellhop eventually after much begging to do it. <br />That is the basic plot. It is a good comedy and for a little more than 10 bucks it is a great addition to anyone's DVD collection. Get it, skip the first room, and enjoy.
B000051Y0G|5.0|Cyndi had been working as a professional singer for a few years, unknown to the public, before hitting the big time with this album, which yielded four international hit singles, all of which made the top five in America. This album of raucous rock music sold several million copies so, though it is not my favorite Cyndi album, this was easily her most successful<br /><br /> The first two hits (Girls just want to have fun, Time after time) made the top three in Britain although the net two (She bop, All through the night) were only minor UK hits. The title track is a gender-adapted cover of a song originally written in 1929. Thus, even on this album, Cyndi showed an interest in songs of a bygone age, something that became much more obvious with her more recent covers album, At last. Another notable song here is When you were mine (written by Prince).<br /><br />Cyndi was hailed as the next megastar following the phenomenal success of this album. It was not to be - Madonna became the megastar instead - but Cyndi has recorded some great music since then including the follow-up, True colors, as well as an outstanding Christmas album (Have a nice life) and a wonderful collection of standards (At last).

The Album does contain the hits \\"Black Dog\\", \\"Rock and Roll\\", of course the masterpiece \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" and my favorite and possibly the greatest end of an album I've heard ever \\"When the Levee Breaks.\\" there is four other tracks which are not disappointing either like \\"The Battle of Evermore\\" and the acoustic \\"Going to California.\\" If you haven't got this my strong suggestion is get it you won't be disappointed.

B00005RYL2|4.0|Nearly lost in straight-to-video-hell, Highlander rose like the Phoenix to become one of the most popular cult classic fantasy adventure movies to ever grace the screen.    Released in 1986 on a shoe string budget, the movie is shot in dark and gritty New York City, flashing back to Scotland hundreds of years earlier.  The main character is Conner MacLeod (played with European gusto by then unknown French actor Christopher Lambert) a Scottish Highlander who discovers, very painfully, that he is special; one of a sparse race of immortals that will walk the Earth until one of them wins `The Prize'.  An early battle scene that takes place in the 1600s depicts him fighting with his clansmen and being impaled by another immortal (not known to him at the time), The Kurgan, played with scene stealing villainous venom by Clancy Brown.      After coming back to life, McLeod is ejected from his village as a demon hellspawn and forced to live in solitude with his wife in the highlands.  Despite his shame, he wants nothing more then to have children and a family.      Enter Sean Connery, in a role that most certainly helped bring him back into the lime light, playing Juan Sanchez Villa-Lobos Ramirez, or `Spanish Peacock' as McLeod likes to call him.  [A strange observation; they have a Frenchman (Lambert) playing a Scotsman, an American (Brown) playing a German barbarian, and a Scotsman (Connery) playing an Egyptian from Spain...strange role reversals, but I digress]  Connery is fantastic, playing the role for all it is worth.  He reveals to Connor his true nature, that he cannot have children, and that they are meant to walk the Earth until `The Gathering', where the last few remaining Immortals will gather and fight for The Prize.    What happens next is somewhat predictable, but nonetheless, Director Russell Mulcahy handles it well.  The action scenes are great with good swordplay between people of different cultures.  The scenes that take place in modern day New York are fascinating in that you get to see how this man born over 300 years ago lives in today's world.      Hot on his heels is an attractive forensic scientist who discovers that McLeod's sword, an ancient early version of a Japanese Katana, was created long before the Samurai ever started making them.  This peaks her interest and soon she finds out more than she ever thought she would.    Although dark and moody, the movie is lightened with flashbacks to McLeod's happier times, some injection of humor in just the right places and music provided by Queen.  All this amounts to very original movie despite its low budget and near death status going to straight to video.  Highly recommended.
B000002HH2|5.0|This is a very good album with many beats that sound very industrail yet quite <br />Army of Me- you enter some kind of very dark factory when you listen to this song full of extravagant beats, that are very retro and heavy <br />Hyperballad- a very good song, that talks about being with someone that you dont really love anymore and the things u do to manage it from falling apart, it sorda sounds like summin that would b on debut but at the same time not really! <br />The Modern things- a very catchy song, with computer like thumps, over and over, were bjork sings about modern things that have always existed on a mountain and how we bothered them! <br />Its oh so quite- a very old jazzy song fromt he 50's or summin, its very easy to get into ur head, with bjork screaming at the top of her lungs <br />Enjoy- A very industrial factory song with a heavy dirty beat, and bjork's voice sounding kinda dark and scary <br />You've been flirting again- a very slow but good song about someone telling bjork that her lover was cheating on her or summin like that lol! its very peaceful! <br />Isobel- starts off with a very relaxing flute sounds in some mystical forest, but then jumps into heavy drum beats and syntethetic fly sounding things its very good very tribal! <br />Possibly Maybe- starting off with a phone ringing then bjork sings about her lover and her breaking up very slow but very electronic, a nice song to actually listen to and enjoy <br />I miss you- a wacky song starting off with footsteps and going into some kind crazy playhouse music its absolutley danceable and very quirky! <br />Cover Me- another song of bjork with a harp i think! and bjork sings about doing the impossible with bjorks voice sounding like its muffled <br />Headphones- a very long song almost 6 minutes that is VERY slow but very atachive it has very sudden quite beats! <br />
B00005K3NR|5.0|Sunday, February 20, 2005 / 5 of 5 / Sad horror tale with emotional performances.<br /><br />Like the Shining's Jack N. looking through the ax-broken door and saying \\"Here's Johnny\\", Carrie's pig-blood spattered wide eye stare is an enduring image of modern horror films.  It had been a while since I'd seen it but watching it again, I'm struck with just how sad the story is.  Rarely do I feel such pathos towards anything in the horror genre but Carrie as played by Sissy Spacek cuts such an emotionally stunted, afraid, and vulnerable figure one can't help but be drawn in.  There are lots of cameos by future stars including Travolta, Nancy Allen, and amusingly, Miami Vice's Larry `Switek' Talbot.  Tormented as a mousy outsider, Carrie, the daughter of a religious nut case, also possesses latent telekinetic powers.  These powers explode outward during periods of emotional stress and/or trauma.  When Carrie is asked to the prom by a popular beau hunk, whose girlfriend is trying to do Carrie a favor, she eventually, meekly, accepts.  She begins her transformation into a princess as personal esteem creeps into her gradually until she's blooming.  At this pinnacle of self worth, Carrie ascends to the thrown as prom queen along with her king.  Sadly, savagely, it ends as Nancy Allen drops the bomb on her.  Carrie lashes out indiscriminately and wreaks havoc on the school, town, and eventually her abusive mother and herself.  Carrie stands the test of time as a film and a warning about how abuse can lead to all encompassing rage.
0671027387|3.0|Deception Point is a fast action thriller written to the same formula as his first book, Digital Fortress. The main character, Rachel Sexton, has the same personality, drive, and abilities. The plot is similar enough that there are few surprises. The only major difference is that there is a greater assortment of supporting characters as more freedom of movement is allowed. In this novel the main character actually gets to leave her office building although this is based on a very flimsy premise. Sexton is sent to verify the NASA find in order to convince the White House staff of its legitimacy. I fail to see the logic in this.<br /><br />In Digital Fortress it was the NSA that was portrayed as evil incarnate; in this book both NASA and the Space Frontier Foundation join the ranks along with, ultimately, the NRO. I was left wondering if Brown really does dislike NASA, etc. and if in fact his novels are guided more by a political agenda than a desire for thrilling readers. At best he seems to consider NASA a misguided venture but fails to see a better way.<br /><br />Deception Point is a fast read and the chapters fly by (hardly surprising as there are 133 of them!). I read this on vacation and would recommend it for the poolside as you can interrupt the book at any time for a dip.
B000002J2F|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Genesis from the Peter Gabriel era, so anything that falls after Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is looked at with some hesitation.  However, I've continued adding to my Genesis collection, buying all the studio albums through Abacab, including this one...Duke.   <br /> <br />Right away Duke hits you as crisp and a bit edgy compaired to it's predecessor, Then There Were Three.  It's a fusion of Genesis at it's prog rock best and the pop influence which was becoming much more dominant in their music at the time of this album's release.  It's evident with Duke that clearly the trio is finding it's musical direction again and producing some quality stuff.  There's not much more to say than what's already been said in the other reviews, but add my vote for Duke, this is a great Genesis album. <br /> <br />
0440211727|3.0|As Grisham's first novel this one has a few rough edges, which he readily admits in the preface. In rural Mississippi a ten year old black girl is beaten, raped and left for dead by two white punks. Although she survives the attack she will be mentally scared for life. The town is outraged but before justice can be done the girl's father takes an M-16 into his own hands and ensures that they are put away for good.<br /><br />Most of the book deals with the implications of having a child raped and of a father's desire to circumvent the \\"imperfect\\" justice system. Grisham pits societal forces against one another with KKK members facing off against black families supporting their own (A feature he will use again in The Chamber). The idea throughout is that if the case were reversed and a white father walked into a courthouse and shot to death his daughters attackers he would be found innocent of any crime. I find this truly unbelievable.<br /><br />My disappointment with this book is Grisham's portrayal of justice as being not justice but survival of the fittest: those with the quickest wits and most able lawyers. Ultimately justice is not done but Grisham leaves you with the feeling that justice is impossible.
B000002UJQ|5.0|To tell you the truth, when I gave this album for a spin for the first few times, I was a bit skeptical. As I was listening, I was reading reviews from this very page, and I didn't agree with anything that anybody was saying. It didn't sound like anything I'd be listening to much more in the near future, but instead of discarding it and calling it crap, I did what everybody who avidly listens to the radio or endlessly watches MTV should do for a change, and I gave it time. I was patient.  <br /> <br />My strategy was to load the CD and hit play, and go on with my normal business, anything that suited me at the time. I didn't necessarily have to be paying complete attention to it, but I'd have to know what I was listening to, it'd have to be loud enough, and I'd have to know it was there. I would continue like this until I found myself humming along with it, and from there was when I was beginning to become immersed into this album. I started getting the urge to listen to it more and more (I'm even listening to it now) until I completely fell in love with the album. <br /> <br />It became an album that I would play all the time, holding my complete attention or not, I knew it was there, and I loved it. As it grew on me more and more, one song that I found myself always going back to was 'Paranoid Android.' No doubt my favorite song on the album, the definitive point being the break after the solo where it starts to go slow. Every time this part is played, I just like to close my eyes and listen. A part I can sink deeply into, and definitely the highest point of the album. <br /> <br />Another one of my favorite parts is the portion with Exit Music (For A Film) and Let Down. The continuity between these two tracks make it almost my favorite part of the album. Exit Music has this melancholy, and sort of dark feel to it, and when the intro riff to Let Down plays, it sort of adds some clarity, like the sun is rising while Exit Music took place during the dark before dawn. The uplifting part of Let Down is also perfect coming right after Exit Music. Even though it doesn't have the same vibe and overall theme, I believe Karma Police rounds off this as a trilogy rather well, also adding a good end to the first half of the album. <br /> <br />The second half of OK Computer isn't as memorable as the first, but it still helps to make this album my favorite of the 90s. I never liked Electioneering from the start, but it slowly grew on me, and now it's a track I often go back to. Climbing Up the Walls added some balance between the two halves when I started to become immersed; I would actually stick around when Karma Police was over just to hear this eerie song. No Surprises, Lucky, and The Tourist are a great way to close the album, but took a little more time for me to get into. <br /> <br />Bottom Line: Don't pass this off after only a few listens. This is a great album; just keep listening, and you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.

Potente (Maria) looks totally different in this movie but it is the same actress after all.   <br />     The rivalry between dept heads is fun to watch, and besides who wouldn't enjoy seeing Matt Damon climb, jump, and threaten his way towards his goals?

B00062IVKI|4.0|Even the non Special Edition of Boxcar Bertha from the Martin Scorsese Collection was presented in Widescreen , but alas New York, New York is only Letterboxed.    It  only includes the  so called restored version of the film which is in reality only one of three versions released.    If any film is more deserving than The Abyss for a \\"watch it the way you want to\\" DVD release it's New York, New York.     The deleated / alternate scenes included do not  represent the differences between the first and third versions of the film, nor do they include the  scenes deleted from the first release to shorten the running time for the second run release.    The Laserdisc Special Edition release had more bonus material  than is included on this DVD.        Guess we'll have to wait for the Ultimate Edition Boxed set for a truely special edition .     In the meantime this one will due.    Sept 2007: Pre - order pages are appearing for New York, New York: 30th Anniversary Edition, Reportedly 2 discs.  Hopefully  it's a vast improvement on this one. Buy it instead.
0385334206|4.0|Breakfast of Champions reads as a fresh work, considering today's political climate.  It is a very anti-American novel and, depending how you voted in the last election, you will either love it or hate it.  The plot concerns a science fiction author, Kilgore Trout (a pun on real-life author Theodore Sturgeon), and a car dealer named Dwayne Hoover.  Hoover is going out of his mind and - after reading one of Trout's books - comes to believe that he is the only person in the world who isn't a robot. <br /> <br />This is an experimental novel.  Vonnegut writes himself into the book and fills it with crude illustrations.  It is funny, biased, and thought-provoking look on American society.  It doesn't have a traditional \\"beginning, middle, and end.\\"  Vonnegut expressly states that he disdains traditional fiction writing because it makes people believe that they should act like characters in books.  It is difficult to imagine agreeing with Breakfast of Champions one-hundred-percent, but it will give you plenty to think about. <br /> <br />
B00000DHRZ|4.0|This CD is sort of overrated. Many people say that it is the best Offspring CD ever released, but many of the band's other albums are better than this. Ixnay On The Hombre, Smash, and Splinter (their most recent release) are all better than Americana (in my opinion). \\"The Kids Aren't Alright\\" is also one of the most overplayed songs on the radio. The CD is still good though. Standout tracks include \\"Have You Ever\\", \\"Starring At The Sun\\", \\"End of The Line\\", and the CD's title track \\"Americana\\". Also on this CD is the powerful and very emotional track \\"Feelings\\". I actually got really pissed off after I listened to that song a few times over. This CD is definetely worth the purchase, its just not definetely not The Offspring's best.
0805076476|4.0|Fight Club is Chuck Palahniuk's first novel, and I still think it is his best.  It is difficult to discuss the book since the movie has become so famous.  I saw the movie first and, although I thought it was flawed, it was still a remarkable piece of filmmaking - especially the first half.  Everything that was great about the film came directly from the book. <br /> <br />I imagine a lot of people take Fight Club as their bible.  I don't think that even Palahniuk feels that way.  Tyler Durden doesn't really have a consistent philosophy to live one's life; if we needed to hunt elk through Rockefeller Center, that would be just as stifling as having to work in an office for a living.   <br /> <br />What makes Fight Club a great novel is that it taps into something we have all felt.  Modern society has made everything corporate.  Authentic experience is getting harder and harder to come by.  We lose our soul working jobs we hate to earn money to buy things that we don't need. <br /> <br /> <br />
0790737345|5.0|Meg Ryan plays a nurse named Maggie who loses a patient on the operating table, who is visited by an angel named Seth(played by Nicholas Cage.)  Of course, our main character doesn't believe in angels, but that is what makes the movie interesting.  The two actors work very well together.  Cage has an engaging gentile side and Ryan matches the emotions very nicely.   This is a love story, which has some very tragic parts.  Bring a box of Kleenex along, you will enjoy this one.

Her father hides drugs for the local kingpin Norman Stansfield, and one day, Stansfield takes revenge on her father, due to the fact that he stretched the drugs a little too far, and thus, kills her whole family while she is out grocery shopping. When she returns from shopping, she notices that her family has been murdered, and turns to her neighbor Leon, who is a professional hitman, for guidance. She eventually finds out exactly what he does for a living, and wants him to take her under his wing, and teach her how to become a \\"cleaner\\" like himself, so that she can avenge her brother's death.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|It's pretty hard for an artist these days to make a successful follow-up to their debut album. Many artists have tried and failed. But Avril has done it again!! Only this time with a fresh new sound.  There are some songs on this album that are reminiscent of her first \\"Let Go\\" such as \\"He Wasn't\\" which did remind me of \\"Sk8er Boi\\" but now that she has ditched her old production team The Matrix this time she delivers new music that is more personal and far more endearing.    Songs such as \\"Take Me Away\\" and \\"Nobody's Home\\" are two completely different styles but at the same time they really let you in to a part of her life that is very personal to her and it is clear to see that she has a lot to get off her chest whether it's anger of how an ex-boyfriend treated her (\\"He Wasn't\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\") or how she felt when her nan died?! (\\"Slipped Away\\") maybe.    It is plain to see that she has come a long way from her first offering \\"Let Go\\". For me it is easier to listen to than her other album as there are lot of songs that I can easily relate to because of what I've been through.    Whether you buy this album because of her ballads, to hear new stuff, or maybe you're craving for more of \\"what she does best\\" then this album is for you. Let's hope she'll be around for a long time and doesn't lose her grip!!!
B0000640SA|5.0|Memento was sadly under marketed. It could have done better with more screens and more marketing as it has mass appeal. Nevertheless, it's been a hit via DVD sales. The film is set up in such a way that you are the protagonist suffering from not remembering what happened last. The sequences are brilliant. I was very sad when Chris Nolan didn't win for Best Original Screenplay for the Academy Awards. The story is original, engaging and thought provoking.
0060958324|5.0|This book is about what the title says - an inquiry into values. But, that is an understatement. The author, through the main character, questions and challenges you to validate how you do and accomplish things. I have tried not to give away the contents in this review for it is best left to be read. <br /> <br />The main character is on a yearly vacation and chooses to take a ride down south from his place in Montana. His son accompanies him. As they ride, Phdrus, recollects his past and the path that led him to his current self. He goes over how he viewed doing or accomplishing tasks and how those around him differed. In the process he depends a great deal on his experience with both eastern and western religion and philosophies. His knowledge of the Hindu scriptures, religion and simple but profound truths is particulary gratifying to me (Twat Tham Asi - I urge you to explore this). <br /> <br />A major part of the book, he spends laying a foundation in defining what he thinks is Quality. By referring to Quality, he in a way, is referring to the Absolute in what one days. A few examples he delineates that come in one's way of looking at or achieving quality - Stuckedness, classic and romantic way of approaching solving a problem, value rigidity.  <br /> <br />Through his journey, both on the motorcycle and his life (past and present), he walks you into constantly thinking and re-evaluating how you can approach your way of doing.  <br /> <br />At times, I felt a great deal of self-righteousness in his approach. After all, not everyone is as gifted as a few people on this earth. His choosing his young son as somebody to display his disapproval constantly is particularly bothering and worrisome if you are a loving parent. Ultimately is it a big relief that he realizes the hypocracy and the truth why he needs to get back to his looked-upon self. Life is more about loving and caring than about how you view things, however right you are.  <br /> <br />The afterward issomething you wouldn't expect. I had read this book twenty or so years ago as a young man and all I could remember today was that it was one the very best books I had ever read. Reading it again, just confirms the thought; only now, it certainly had a more profound impact.  <br /> <br />
B00005JMYI|4.0|Yes, this movie is dumb. But it is fricking hilarious. Will Ferrell is a comedic genius. Ron Burgundy is a lovable loser without a clue, and Steve Carrell steals the show as an incompetent weatherman. The writing and improvisation was funny, and it was a laugh a minute!
B00009V7RF|5.0|Black Eyed Peas have came back with a blast.  This CD is funky and a good time.  I love the beat on all the songs.  They make you want to dance and  many of the songs have a focus to them and they are trying to a point across. Have fun with music.  That is their point.  Each song on this CD is great.  I don't recall any songs that I skip.  They all have a funky beat and make you get up and move.  This CD is one find I am happy I stumbled on!
B00005JNPZ|5.0|This is the Best Movie you will ever come across to spark the beginning Year of 2005. The movie has everything in it, comedy, romance, action(few), ect. I have nothing else to say about this movie but that it is the best dating movie ever! You should go watch it now! There's nothing better.
B0000CFW87|5.0|Closer is a great CD.  I think it is a CD of passion and great music.  \\"You Raised Me Up\\" has got to be one of my favorite songs of all time.  It is just wonderful and full of passion and an awesome voice!  But each song has its place on this magnificent CD.  Some songs I have no clue what he is singing but I can just feel the passion and his voice changes with certain lyrics so it makes you understand.  This CD is just as great as his first CD.  I highly recommend getting the self titled along with this CD.  His voice will overpower you!
0345440900|4.0|3.5 to 4.0 stars    Hey dads, moms, grandparents, etc.,  Here is a bit of my experience with The Baby Whisperer.    My wife and I were looking for something that was in between the stricter method of child rearing and the loosey goosey methods.  We knew that each way had its merits but wanted more information on when one method would be preferable over another and/or how to implement a hybrid of both.    Tracy Hogg's Baby Whisperer seemed to be that middle ground and provided a lot of the answers we were looking for.  Note that it didn't provide them all and we dismissed some methodology that we didn't want at all.  However, we were able to file that information away \\"just in case.\\"    She seems to lean a bit more toward the stricter, \\"Babywise\\" side, at least in the scheduling department, but she does allow for some flexibility.  We tried to implement her EASY method but our son needed some variation on it and that was fine.  As long as we were consistent, a point she emphasizes, he had fewer problems.  And with eating and sleeping, she can discuss how to do it in general terms but the detailed intricacies need to be discovered by individual parents based on the situation.  Sure, a routine of bath, story, and into the crib is easy to write but leaves some blanks that the parent must fill in (does the baby like a rocking chair for the story or somewhere else? Is a bath at night feasible for the parents or would a mid-day bath be better?).  Over time, the parents learn about the baby and vice versa and Hogg's methods are implemented more easily because of this increased familiarity.    As for common sense, yes, she does talk about things that are common sense to some people but when it comes to parenting, the definition of common sense can vary.  She gives some nuances that can be applied to basic \\"common sense.\\"  And think about dealing with a screaming newborn for the first time and remember how common sense can go out the window for some people.  But the more youread, hear and evaluate advice on parenting, the more prepared you will be to recognize what is common sense.    One of the problems I had was that her numbers don't always seem to add up.  As she lists out timelines, I felt her math was a bit off.  So, when looking for her recommendations on when to do something, I was often confused because start and stop times would overlap.  However, I could get the main idea of what she was saying and would just adjust it to fit but this was not always easy.    And, yes, she does classify babies into four categories.  Of course, this is very small but it gives a good base.  This is done all the time and we actually looked at it as a starting point.  Does our son fit one category?  Does he straddle more than one?  It isn't the end all, be all of personality types but it is a point of reference, much like the book as a whole.    As for the father part, this was another book that helped me feel less in the dark when it came to parenting decisions.  My wife didn't have to know everything herself and could use me as a resource.  I could also decipher the \\"book-speak\\" of acronyms and theories that new parents often have.  I also knew that I could get my son to sleep (usually) when it was bedtime, among other things.    In general, the BEST thing I've learned from parenting books, classes, my wife and other parents is that no one method works across the board when applied to babies and kids.  Nothing!  There are things that might work 99% of the time but don't be surprised when a \\"proven\\" method comes up short.  At those times, a little improv can help and then it is good to have more than one source of information to pull from.  This book is not for everyone and I can't advise anyone to only use this book as their reference at home.  But it does come with a lot of good information and that information needs to be evaluated before implementing.  As for us, we liked it enough to add the toddler version to our collection of books aboutthat age.
B00004ZAV3|4.0|The Beatles 1 is a great CD of Beatles number one hits.  It also has the best songs on it.  Songs everyone young and old know and sing.  There is at least one Beatles song that everyone knows and loves.  Many of the Beatles songs people may not even know it is the Beatles singing them but will be happy that they do because this CD is full of great songs!  The only song I am disappointed that is not on here is \\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\"  But other than that it is a great CD for any Beatles fan.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Just buy it.  It's their best album yet.  I'm addicted to it.  And I loved there old stuff.  It will be in your CD player for a while.  Guaranteed.
B000001EL7|5.0|This album was one of the first albums I remember getting as a kid.  I remember the first time I heard of Kiss was my brothers Alive album and I was hooked just from the look of the band from then on.  Each song on this album, like Destroyer before it, took on a different part of each member of the band and showed what this band was really made of.  From Peter's Hooligan song to Ace's Shock Me it played up their persona's to a T.  Peter was the catman, and cats are well known for being mischevious, Ace's Shock Me since he was a Spaceman he played with electricity, Gene's Plaster Caster showed the Demon as a very playful but sinful character, Paul's Love Gun..need I say more about this song with the Starchild?  I think what made this band the band they were at this time period was the fact that they tried to keep their image going by any means necessary.  I still have alot of magazines where the members would cover their faces in public to try to keep from being seen without their makeup.  That's what made Kiss to me, was the not knowing part of who they were the mystery of them.  That's why I think what they are doing nowadays just doesn't have the same kick as it did back then.  We know who they are now, it's lost the mystery.  Oh and just to back up the Amazon reviewer, he is correct that this was the last album that the original four members did together.  Dynasty and Unmasked both had studio players sit on on songs.  Just because they were seen on the album cover doesn't mean they were on the album.  Peter did one song I do believe if I remember correctly the rest of the album was done with a studio drummer.
0451191153|5.0|Whether you agree with the ideas Rand presents or think she is one with the devil, \\"The Fountainhead\\" is a powerful and moving book that I highly recommend.  Although it is long, it is very tightly written.  There are no unnecessary scenes, no irrelevant characters and no ad nauseum descriptions of sunsets and waterfalls.<br /><br />There are several reasons I love this book, none having to do with the controversial philosophies of the author.  The first is the amazing characterization.  There were several people in the book that could have been drawn directly from people in my life:  the social worker who works more out of self-righteousness than pure altruism, the over-blown academic who can read meaning and symbolism in tripe, the professional who cares more about where his work takes him than the quality of the work itself.  Rand doesn't draw these as flat characters.  Instead we actually see their flaws and motivations in all their beauty and terror.<br /><br />I also love the idealism of Roark.  Several previous reviews have termed him \\"egotistical\\" with a \\"superiority complex\\", but that isn't how I see him at all.  Would a professional who meets those descriptions lower himself to working as a common laborer at a quarry?  Roark doesn't care if his work is good or not, let alone that it is superior.  All that matters is that it pleases him.  He might work a menial job, but he wouldn't debase himself to produce anything but the kind of art that pleases him, whatever anyone else says about its quality.<br /><br />The insight of the book into the power of the press and the country's growing socialization is another drawing point.  I crack up whenever I read the Banner's editorial on parenthood in modern times.  It describes how parents need to be just as loving toward and concerned about other children as they are of their own.  It reads remarkably like Hillary Clinton's \\"It Takes a Village\\".  In an age where talentless performers are at the top of the chart because of the right buzz, I can understand the idea that he who controls the media, controls the tastes of the masses.<br /><br />A common criticism of \\"The Fountainhead\\" is the rape of Dominique by the hero.  Like so much of the book, it is not something that can be understood if you only view it in a vacuum.  Roark and Dominique have an almost transcendental bond.  Throughout the book they start in the middle of conversations and understand each other as if they were one.  Their violent first sexual encounter is not indicative of Roark's character or of their relationship.<br /><br />There are some simplistic parts of the book: all capitalists are good, all socialists are bad, wanting to help people and do good is described as an excuse, not a noble motive.  Still, there is so much good in this beautiful book that I consider it one that everyone should read.can understand the idea that he who controls the media, controls the tastes of the masses.

B00005JMYI|4.0|Pretty funny,.  Nothing too special, but it did provide laughs, which I believe comedys are supposed to do, right?  My only complaint was the completely unsseciary scene with Jack Black punting a dog off a bridge.  The dog didn't die, and it had no essential effect on the ovie, so why do it?  However,. it was entertaining overall, and I do recommend it.
038572179X|5.0|I've recommended this masterwork to several friends and colleages...A truly impressive piece of literature. Should be on everyone's top ten list. McEwan is officially one of our greatest living writers.
B00005JKGO|5.0|This is a film that is very difficult not to watch.  Once you press play, the DVD keeps you stimulated for three very short hours.  Mastroianni's performance is every bit as good here as it was in \\"8 1/2\\" but this is a far better film.  Indeed, I regard it as Fellini's strongest.  I am still amazed at how accurately the paparazzi are depicted in the film.  Whenever real life intrudes upon the glossy, soma-drugged lifestyle of Rome's socialites, the paparazzi are there to take pictures and instigate more action.  Their presence sometimes even changes the events they are there to record.  The main character Marcello yearns for a more serious life but the shallow road is the only one that provides constant reinforcement.  The lessons on how not to lead your life are all around him but Marcello is unable to synthesize their meaning.  His life is sweet only at the surface level.  He barely knows his father and barely knows the woman he lives with, but there are always parties, parties, and more parties to attend.  The life is drunken and short, but only sweet for a few isolated moments.  Fellini's message was profound and I hope that future viewers continue to internalize it.
0553573403|5.0|I consider myself a fantasy fan.  I like fantasy.  So I picked up this book and read it.  Since then my life has never been the same.  How can I read the average slop that is fantasy when I have now tasted what true brilliance is?  How can I suffer through anymore \\"wizard and young person who is more than he/she seems\\" when I have experienced a plot that defies description?  Reading fantasy novels, which was once my passion, has now just become what I do in between the release dates of the Fire and Ice series.  If you are happy with the standard twenty volume series, then stay away.  Ignorance is bliss.  This novel truly redefines the entire genre in a way NO writer has.<br /><br />First, as I stated before, each character is well defined.  Even the ones you think are not, will be later.  Second, the plot is BRILLIANT.  It is literally impossible to say what this book is about because it is about so many things.  However, despite its complexitey, it really is very accessible.  Within two chapters you are hooked.  Third, the writing is superb.  There is nothing about this book that is negative.<br /><br />The only caveat I would have is that with an opening this good, things cannot possible get better.  Luckily, I have read the next two volumes, and let me say, things can get better.<br /><br />If you have not read this book, then please do so right now.  The accolades are deserved.  The love is earned.  This is a bestseller that should be because it is writing at its best.
B0001L3LUE|5.0|I was hoping more would be discussed about the War on Terror and the world today, but other than that this is one of the best documentary's I've seen.   <br /> <br /> <br />In response to the ridiculous review review by Matthew W. Cero \\"The Goalie\\", it should be noted that the movie is \\"clipped\\" together because in the beginning of the movie, McNamara talks of hanging sentences and how if he pauses in mid sentence, he will just continue from where he left off.   <br /> <br />It should not suprise anyone that parts are \\"clipped\\" together because an 85 yr old pauses in mid sentence <br /> <br />As for the claim that 100,000 dead civilians was dubbed in, he may not move his lips but he's sure moving his tongue.  He didn't become a ventriloquist at 85! <br /> <br />Some people need to wake up.  This movie isn't for partisan hacks.
1400032717|5.0|I just finished reading Haddon's novel about a 15 year old autistic boy. I didn't enjoy the book but could not put it down. <br />My autistic son is 30 years old. It was as if Haddon had been hiding in our house. Few authors possess the insights of Mark Haddon to write such an accurate story about autistics and the dynamic that controls their families, friends and teachers. <br /> <br />The thing that impresses me most with Haddon's story is that he did not end it with the sappy uplift that characterizes many of the books written about autistics. <br /> <br />The struggle for the parents of autistics will simply go on. Most of us have embraced the reality that we must adapt to our children and stop looking for a cure or something to blame for autism. <br /> <br />Another reality that Haddon wrote of was that society will be slow to understand and accept autistics and their behaviors. <br /> <br />I did not enjoy reading this book but am thankful to Mark Haddon for shedding valuable light on autism. <br /> <br />John H.

0446677450|3.0|This is an average book - doesn't take too long to read and you probably will never read it twice.  I am amazed that it has been on the bestseller list this long, but the book does have some good points.<br /><br />Kiyoasaki basically stresses that while hard work does make money, investments make more money.  You can waste your life away working for an employer who will capture most of your value added, or you can invest in real estate or whatever and make money just sitting there.<br /><br />This main thesis leads to more ideas: college is not the best path for everyone, negotiation is key, etc.  But 90% of the book just emphasizes over and over the above point.  I found it enlightening but a bit repetitive.<br /><br />I think Kiyosaki downplays the risks to investments though - you could lose everything, whereas working for an employer the most you can lose is your current income stream.  Also, if everyone subscribed to this theory, a huge real estate or stock bubble would emerge. I think it is safe to say that not everyone is jumping aboard, but with or without his book, bubbles do develop in investing and you could get creamed (anyone remember real estate in California during the 80s?).  I think he does talk about stock bubbles in another book, but seeing as he has about 20 books out now, I wasn't about to go read all of them.  What he needs to do is condense them all into one and then you might have a solid read with a real thicket of information.  As it is, I think the book has one really good idea that is repeated over and over.  So buy it if you feel my explanation hasn't been thorough enough, but there isn't that much more there.
0385510454|2.0|As a cloak and dagger novel, very unsatisfying - a nice build-up that just fizzles at the end.  The novel feels unfinished.
0393035158|2.0|I applaud Sam for his sharing of his beliefs re:faith. Religion, faith, belief systems, cutural milieu's are all of great interest to me as I try to sort out not who I am but what I am regarding my life on the planet. The difference relates to being...who I am is personality which incorporates change, albeit subtle throughout one's life; soul is the essence of what I am and that is changeless, neutral and a silent observer.Getting the personality in line with the soul is essential to ending the violence and intolerance we  perceive is happening. There is a knowing regarding this when there are glimpses of an overwhelming feeling of peace, an instant of the sense of unconditional love.Beliefs, on the other hand, are structured around an underlying sense that maybe, just an inth of maybe, something might not be true. Knowing is a surety that brings a deep sense of calm and peace with all the inherent responses that follow, when one would be perceived nuts to even think such an idea in a chaotic and shambled situation.  <br /> <br />Around all this, I would ask Sam if he is aware of the book A COURSE IN MIRACLES. I have found this to be the most mind-changing conversational, psychological guideline for challenging the mind about the mind. Forgiveness and illusions are well presented with their concomitant results. Reasoning is in the forefront and  surrounds all that is presented. Interestingly, psychologists who have read the text and have done the lessons presented have seen almost immediate change in the workplace and relationships, the latter of which is what living on the planet is all about.  <br /> <br /> I had hoped Sam would have come across this in his outlining beliefs about mysticism and religion. The Gnostics were cut out of the conference that finalized who would get in the book: Bible. So mysticism was rejected for Christianity's insititutionalization. Interesting since the East and its ideas of spirituality were next door to Rome and there was a competition in ideologies and \\"tribal adherance\\". Try out A COURSE IN MIRACLES (no author) only Foundation For Inner Peace publisher.It is being translated in many languages around the world. This might create a balance with Sam's thoughts on faith and show history continues and perceptions are capricious. <br /> <br />
B00025ETIW|5.0|I had only heard \\"I'm Not Ok (I Promise)\\" before buying this CD, and honestly it doesn't say nearly enough about the CD's true genre. I also have MCR's first CD, but they've definitely caught onto something with Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.  <br /> <br />Favorite songs: <br />Helena, To The End, I'm Not Ok (I Promise), The Ghost of You (LOVE THIS SONG), The Jetset Life Is Gonna Kill You, Cemetery Drive (LOVE THIS SONG), I Never Told You What I Did For A Living (ADORE THIS), and It's Not A Fashion Statement, It's a Deathwish. <br /> <br />Alright I pretty much loved the entire CD. I haven't been able to  stop listening to it/cannot get tired of it. Their lyrics are dark, interesting, and captive. Their beat is original and quirky, really catching. All  and all, Gerald Way and his band are bloody brilliant.
B00064MW6A|2.0|First of all, I'd like to say that \\"Catwoman\\", although not a good film by any means, isn't the worst superhero movie I've ever seen. In fact, I'd argue that last year's \\"Daredevil\\" was worse. This film isn't horribly acted or directed; it's just ill-conceived, with a shabby premise and a mediocre script.<br /><br />Instead of spinning off the Selina Kyle character wonderfully adapted from the comics (and brilliantly played by Michelle Pfeiffer) in \\"Batman Returns\\", the masterminds behind \\"Catwoman\\" made the decision to create a brand new Catwoman character, this one with actual superhuman, cat-like powers and abilities. The result is that this film not only betrays the built-in fan base of comic book fans, but fails to deliver an interesting or exciting substitute for catburglar Selina Kyle.<br /><br />Halle Berry tries hard to rise above the material, and she does a fairly good job at playing both mousy graphic designer Patience Phillips and feisty, sexy Catwoman. And given the right material, Sharon Stone, icy and diabolical, could have been a wonderful villianess. It's just that both actresses are doomed by the script, premise, and in Halle's case, RIDICULOUS costume design.<br /><br />This movie should serve as a warning for the film studios: When adapting a film from a comic book, it's okay to take slight liberties to make the film work, but if you completely betray the original creation, you're doomed to failure.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Time Is Running Out and Hysteria are undoubtedly the two best tracks on Absolution.  I bought it based upon these two stellar songs, yet these two powerful and invigorating songs are hardly a microcosm of the entire album.  While the CD is solid, replete with incredibly introspective lyrics (e.g. Endlessly & Ruled By Secrecy) and intense guitar work(Hysteria, The Small Print, and Stockholm Syndrome come to mind), it can be a little draining at times with the seemingly indefatigable over-the-top brooding emotion from Matthew Bellamy on almost every song.<br /><br />That being said, it's an undeniably solid effort - just not something I could listen to every day like a Franz Ferdinand.  With lyrics like \\"Your death creates success rebuild and suppress\\" from Ruled by Secrecy, I'm sure you can understand why.
0156027321|5.0|This book is very well-written and a real joy to read and reread.  The story and resolution will really make you think about things, whether or not you wind up believing in God, which is the stated purpose for the retelling of the story.  Give it a chance and I really doubt you will be disappointed.
B000683VI4|2.0|I have read all of Nicholas Sparks' novels and have seen all of his film adaptations.  The Notebook was a very simple love story but it possessed all the elements to make you laugh, scream, love, and cry.  In short, it really moved you.  This film adaptation, however, did not. I wanted to like it, I really did, but I actually found myself fast forwarding through some of it.  One of my biggest pet peeves is when movies deviate noticeably from their book counterparts, and this movie just barely follows the rough outline of the novel.  It left out key parts of the novel and skimmed over others, made up new parts to introduce to the story and virtually changed everything about the book.  The actors playing Allie and Noah showed great promise but never really reached their full potential.  On the upside, Gena Rowlands did pretty well playing the elderly and unaware Allie and James Gardner shined as the elderly Noah.  Overall, however, there was nothing in this film that grabbed me, held my interest... moved me.  I feel that the two hours I spent watching this movie were wasted ones... I wish I had just re-read the novel instead.
B000002ADT|5.0|Kind of Blue isn't merely an artistic highlight for Miles Davis, it's an album that towers above its peers, a record generally considered as the definitive jazz album, a universally acknowledged standard of excellence. Why does Kind of Blue posses such a mystique? Perhaps because this music never flaunts its genius. It lures listeners in with the slow, luxurious bass line and gentle piano chords of \\"So What.\\" From that moment on, the record never really changes pace -- each tune has a similar relaxed feel, as the music flows easily. Kind of Blue works on many different levels. It can be played as background music, yet it amply rewards close listening. It is advanced music that is extraordinarily enjoyable. It may be a stretch to say that if you don't like Kind of Blue, you don't like jazz -- but it's hard to imagine it as anything other than a cornerstone of any jazz collection.
B000683VI4|5.0|\\"The Notebook\\" is a great heartwarming romance! The performances by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are excellent and the performances of James Garner and Gena Rowlands are emotionally excellent. The directing by Nick Cassavettes is excellent.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Are they hacks or geniuses? I'll let you be the judge, but in any event, they've made one hell of a CD.  It's not perfect by any means, and has many more slow, brooding ballads than anticipated.  That being said, those songs still jive well with the carefree and high-spirited songs like Are You Gonnna Be My Girl, Rollover DJ, & Cold Hard B****.  The more uptempo and invigorating tracks Get What You Need, Get Me Outta Here, and Take It Or Leave It stand out as a cut above the rest.<br /><br />The only knock is the ostensibly \\"enhanced\\" CD has nothing more than \\"web link\\" and \\"play CD\\" options and the artwork in the jewel case includes no lyrics.  All around good stuff, though.  Look forward to their sophomore release later this year.
B0006213WG|5.0|Sum 41 began as a pop/punk group with albums like \\"Half an Hour of Power\\" and \\"All Killer No Filler\\". They were also well known for their hip-hop/rock hit, Fat Lip. \\"Does This Look Infected\\" was the beginning of a new style for Sum 41. With \\"Chuck\\", Sum 41 has adapted to this style.    1) Intro: 8/10  A nice intro which demonstrates the groups talent.    2) No Reason: 10/10   A very cool, fast-paced song. You'll get hooked right from the beginning. I love it when the group yells \\"Hey! Hey! Hey!\\". It's so cool.    3) We're All to Blame: 10/10  A cool metal song with hard verses and soft choruses. The bridge of this song is very cool. But it sounds a lot like System of a Down's \\"Chop Sue\\". This is also the first single off the album. However, the music video is dumb and unoriginal.    4) Angels With Dirty Faces: 8/10  The beginning of this song is it's weakness. Deryck's voice sounds just plain wierd. I don't really like the punk rhythm of the drums in the chorus either. But other than that, this is a pretty cool, fast, and dark song.    5) Some Say: 8/10  A nice, soft, acoustic song. However, the chorus sounds a lot like the chorus of \\"Handle This\\", and the singing gets a little repetitive.    6) The Bitter End: 8/10  A very Metallica-inspired song. The solos are the best that Sum 41 has ever done. Unfortunatly, I don't really like thrash metal so the drumming kinda bugged me. Also, the riffs are repeated too often.    7) Open Your Eyes: 7/10  A bit of a poppy song. The verses sound as if they are being rapped (not a bad thing). The bridge has some chord being played at strange times. There's nothing really special about this special. However, the solo is pretty cool.    8) Slipping Away: 4/10  Worst song on the album. It's short, slow, and boring.     9) I'm Not the One: 10/10  I love this song! I don't know why other people don't. It's kinda like a combination of Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, and Raining Blood. The verse are rapped and the bridge has one of the coolestriffs I've ever heard.    10) Welcome to Hell: 6/10  An average song. There are only 2 guitar riffs in the whole song. The bridge is just a bunch of distortion. The bass solo is cool though.    11) Pieces: 10/10  The best soft song that Sum 41's ever made. It's also the 2nd single off the album. The video is interesting but not great, at least it's better than We're All to Blame's. It's hard to describe this song. It starts off soft, then it gets hard, then soft again.    12) There's No Solution: 8/10  I agree with the reviewer who said that this is an underated song. The intro riff is cool. I also like the outro.    13) 88: 9/10  The longest song on the album. This song is split into 3 parts. The first part is the main singing part. It then enters the instrumental section with several riffs and solos. It then climaxes with a bunch of effects and distortion with Deryck singing and yelling \\"I'm losing control!\\".
B00005OAA6|5.0|I was excited to learn that Victoria Beckham had landed a solo career so I had to sample the tunes right away. I was surprised from the fantastic results. Most of the tracks are catchy pop tunes that you can tear the dance floor to. I thought it was so great, I had to place an order for a copy right away. This is what music should be all about. To hell with all of the rock bands that keep coming in and claiming that they're real because they stay true to themselves- screw that! This is what should really be happening! Listen to the samples and see what I mean. The debut single \\"Not Such an Innocent Girl\\" will not let you down.
B00006AW2J|5.0|A strong acoustic Delta blues flavor colors much of the material, particularly \\"Salt of the Earth\\" and \\"No Expectations,\\" which features some beautiful slide guitar work. Basic rock & roll was not forgotten, however: \\"Street Fighting Man,\\" a reflection of the political turbulence of 1968, was one of their most innovative singles, and \\"Sympathy for the Devil,\\" with its fire-dancing guitar licks, leering Jagger vocals, African rhythms, and explicitly satanic lyrics, was an image-defining epic. At the time, though, the approach was still fresh, and the lyrical bite of most of the material ensured Beggars Banquet's place as one of the top blues-based rock records of all time.
B00005JN4H|5.0|This movie is SO darn funny! Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah truly play off each other so well - you can tell that a lot of the dialogue has been ad libbed. One of the funniest movies I've seen in a long while! Ann-Margaret does a wonderful job playing Jimmy's drunk mother, and Henry Simmons (\\"Belle's\\" boyfriend\\") is wonderful eye candy! Jennifer Esposito portrays a wonderful Lt. to Jimmy as well - great cast, great movie, great laughs. BUY IT!
B00008DDXC|5.0|I ordered this DVD in widescreen format. The sound was of very poor quality, as was the picture. I kept adjusting the tracking and the volume, but in the end I ended up throwing both discs away. It was a waste of money. Other Harry Potter DVDs have been okay, but not this-- actually, everything's just a lie-- this is a great movie.
B000268QB2|4.0|This CD makes my list of the best of the year in 2004. It is hard not to keep saying that Keane sounds like Coldplay. However, they have their own original sound and they do it without bass and guitar. Also, it is nice to hear the tenor vocals. I can't help, but smile when listening to Keane even though some of the songs are about themes of melancholy.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Let me say first off that I was surprised how much I enjoyed the film.  I expected to dislike the new characters after years of loving the London cast, but I must say that it felt like seeing it for the first time all over again.  I've seen the show on Broadway and although nothing can take the place of the magic of the stage, this is excellent in other ways.  It goes beyond the limitations of the stage and provides a rounded view of the storyline.  The first time I watched the movie it was with skeptic eyes, I've now seen the movie four times and enjoy it more each time I watch. <br />As far as the actors, I love Patrick Wilson in the role of Raoul and Emmy Rossum does an excellent job capturing the innocence and pull towards the Phantom.  I was skeptical of Gerard Butler, although I am a fan of his acting in previous movies, but I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed his performance in the movie and also his singing capabilities.  It's not perfect, but I don't think that it's meant to be that way.  I know many fans who did not like the route taken with the Phantom character, but I found it more appealing and also more believable for Christine to fall for this character. <br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone and advise to keep an open mind and let your fantasies unwind!  Enjoy!

B0002858YS|3.0|I guess I'm one of the few rock fans still old enough to remember David Bowie's 3rd Album - shame on me - should've died, before I got old. The penultimate track on the original Hunky Dory (not the re-issued 90s version) was a bit of glam rock angst called 'Queen Bitch' - allegedly about one of Mr. Bowie's male lovers picking up another guy while he looked on in shame and desperation. The following line appeared in that song:  <br />\\"There's a taste in my mouth and it's no taste at all, <br />and I'm phoning a cab, cause my stomach feels small.\\" <br />I'm amazed that not a single reviewer has noticed the similarity, both thematically and lyrically this Album's Mr Brightside.  <br />Of course, if this is the Killers' homage to Dave's ravings of 30 odd years ago, all well and good... but guys, if you're gonna steal a riff, or a line from a song, be arch enough to acknoledge it somewhere, please.  <br />Had to get that off my chest.  <br />For the rest, this is pretty typical of a particular vein of post Strokes pop (I know we're supposed to think this is punk, but it's simply not - it's pop music). The music's OK - sometimes it's pretty good. But it's got some growing up to do.
B00005AQE8|5.0|I have been a 2pac fan for a while now, but have never been able to get hold of all eyez.. for whatever reason. Not wishing to download it illegally, I finally managed to get hold of it. I was blown away - there is no other album like it on the market. The tour de force of rap, with just about every major west coast and east coast star bar the notorious big on it. Disc one is definitely more of a party disc, with california love and all about you being some of my favourite party tunes. there is a sensitive side to the disc as well, with life goes on and I ain't mad at cha. Only god can judge me is also a very strong track. there are no weak tracks, and space is not taken up with unnecessary skits, for example on the d12 albums, or redman's malpractice. it is more like a greatest hits. Disc two is much darker, but the title track and picture me rollin' are the two standouts. the flow and wordplay of 2pac standout as particularly expressive and fluent, and he has cemented his name in history with this record. an essential. buy it now.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|Animal House was a changing of the Hollywood comedy guard in 1978. Serious films like The Godfather directed by Coppola or Taxi Driver by Scorcese, which both appeared in the 70's brought the French New Wave and Post-War Italian techniques to America and hence, film became edgier and realistic.    Bob Hope, Doris Day, and Sandra Dee dominated the 60's with light comedy, breezy shtick, and virginated sex comedy.  Looking back to the early 60's, the Kennedy years, America was not going to deal with those crazy college kids and their first attempts at capturing what was left of the Beatnik Era. With a simmering middle class producing college bound kids in baby boom numbers, the youth culture looked for their own laugh statement.      2nd City, National Lampoon, and Saturday Night Live writers and performers finally got the Hollywood green light, so naturally, with pent up baby boomer instinct, they produced the most influential comedy of the last twenty-five years.      The boys of Delta are essentially The Three Stooges with snappier dialogue. That's the similarity, but the difference is about rebellion and sex. The nubile young girls truly show their stuff.  Dean Wormer's wife is a middle-aged Victoria's Secret. The Sandra Dee look-a-likes are daffy and weirdly sexual, almost perverted, not that there's anything wrong with that.      Does it hold up 25 years later?  This is tricky.  My generation will always love a spirited laugher about the old days when we did some pretty risky stuff.  Today, a college student, living a moderately Charlotte Simmons's lifestyle might yawn with studied angst.  I give it to you Dean Wormer!

B000268QB2|5.0|I heard Keane play on Saturday Night Live and was intrigued by the fact that the band consists of only a singer, a drummer and a pianist.  All that music and all that sound from such a simple ensemble was impressive.  I purchased their CD and haven't been disappointed yet.  The songs are very easygoing and are delivered in an evocative, earnest, matter-of-fact manner with no hint of pretentiousness.  I'm not quite sure how to categorize this, but if I had to I'd say something in the ways of indie pop.  Several songs you will find yourself singing along to, and others you will want to listen to with the door open on a beautiful day just lounging on the couch.  I look forward to their followup CD whenever that comes out.

B0006GAOBI|1.0|This \\"updated version\\" ends up being an endurance test in boredom and humility.  Not only is the pace drawn to an almost halt through the whole flick, but everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) is spelled out.  Where in the first version, you had to watch the movie a couple of times to grasp this amazing puzzle, now the director is holding your hand as he assumes that his audience is comprised of bumbling idiots!  Not since the voice-overs of Superfriends have I been so insulted <br />If you're looking for a twisted and mind-boggling trip into dramatic scifi, pick up the \\"original\\" DVD, but if enjoy shutting your brain off while episodes of \\"Joey\\" pass in front of your listless, drooling face, then I'm sure you'll love this new director's cut. <br />And as for the commentary track?  I'm a big Kevin Smith fan, but if you are going to talk over a movie, at least talk about the movie!  Don't be the old couple that are always sitting behind me at the theater discussing how bad the service was at Denny's.   <br />I want my money back.  The 2 hours are gone forever.

B00006JKOL|4.0|Jethro Tull over the years have released many classic albums. This is another one of their finest. <br />The Minstrel in the Gallery shows Jethro Tull moving in a new direction than previous albums. <br />It starts with the title song \\"The Minstrel in the Gallery\\" which to this day remains one of Ian Andersons finest compositions. The acoustic guitar shows Tull in top form.  <br />\\"Cold wind to Valhalla\\" is another fine song from this CD. I like the acoustic side of Tull as much as the electric. Cold wind to Valhalla is a fine piece of music. <br />Black Satin Dancer is next and it shows the interplay between Ian Anderson and Martin Barre that has always been the foundation of Tulls sound. <br />One white Duck is also on this CD and remains a favorite of mine. <br />For any true Jethro Tull fan this is a must. For anyone who wants to hear Tull and wants to listen to their music, I suggest you give this a listen. <br />Martin Barre is outstanding on electric guitar. Ian Anderson plays alot of flute as usual. Enjoy
B0006IIPIK|1.0|I can't believe I waisted my money and time watching this boring movie!
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I am 22, listen to classic Rock and modern rock of the eighties, I like Led Zeppelin, Van Halen, Def Leppard etc.   <br />And many in my Generation are just like me, earlier rock was alive, rebellious, not afraid to challenge anything.  Back then rock music was so popular on the radio. Thats why there were the epic, legendary bands, bands that would have almost cult followings. People would throw themselves at them.    <br /> <br />Then came this era, You turn on any hit music station, you will hardly hear rock, you hear mainly pop, hip-hop, and R&B.  And most of todays rock is manufactured, heartless.  What happend to the Electric Guitar, when it used to howl and scream like a wild animal instead of one or two power chords, guitar solos for that matter.  I love the electric guitar and I missed it. <br /> <br />THEN CAME JET!!! <br />A band with members who are only a few years older than myslelf, put life back into Rock n Roll, The Electric Guitar came alive once again and howled and screamed.  A revolution started in rock n roll, and will forever be remembered as the sound of the 2000's.   <br /> <br />To those who said they are just ripping off the epic, legendary bands of the 60's and 70's.  They, like those bands of yesteryear, used what they considered rock and roll, this is the style of Rock Jet likes, the style many in my Generation like.  They gave the people what they wanted to hear, not become just another no-name band.  To be an epic one. One that will define this decade. <br /> <br />JET, We salute you!!!
B00000099Y|1.0|Tool's followers are not going to hell for listening to an anti-Christ artist, but for a more serious reason. Every 5-star review praising Tool that I have read is pitiful. It's as though it is against the rules of heavy metal to say something negative about this band, and if one truthful negative comment is made, that person is stranded with \\"0 out of 35 users found this review helpful.\\" So to avoid that sickening mark of helpfulness, you instead lie, and inadvertantly cheat and steal from the purchaser of Amazon, their coveted $15 (approximately) that is spent on this CD. Shame on you! You will go to hell for that! It's time that you stop believing what you hear and express your true thoughts. Oh, isn't that what Tool is supposedly about? How ironic.  <br /> <br />As far as Aenima is concerned, I enjoy most of the songs by themselves, with exception to the six random filler tracks. What a waste of my time, to have to sit through six entire random tracks that are filler and random noises that sound like monkeys playing with the band's instruments. Sorry Tool, but most people prefer to hear thought-provoking and creative songs, not this horrid excuse for music. As much as I would love to say that the remaining nine songs on this album are incredible, I simply cannot do so without lying. Basically, they are all the same song just with a few variations. They begin slowly, then pick up the pace and get a little bit bipolar, then they mellow back down to the end. It's the same exact blueprint on every single track that could even legally pass as a true song. Which is why I say that I like most of these nine songs INDIVIDUALLY, but when playing them back-to-back, they all sound the same and I begin to doze off. Perhaps that is why Tool chose to inject six tracks of random noises in between each song, in an effort to mix things up a little bit with chimpanzees playing on the instruments. The sad part is, the monkeys play with more variation than Tool does. If they could sing and write lyrics, then perhaps they'd be better than Tool. I would recommend Undertow over this CD, because it does in fact sound like those monkeys playing that can even sing and write lyrics. I expect you biased Tool fanboys to choose \\"not helpful\\", but the bottom line is, you can't deny a word I just said. I would recommend some better bands, but I'd rather have it that the Tool fanboys keep their self-righteous ignorant selves swarming around bands that are junk, opposed to really talented bands. Go dye your hair black and continue worshipping Satan!
B0002XVQNU|4.0|I didn't care too much for Colin Farrell's obnoxious one-dimensional character, Bullseye, nor Michael Duncan Clark's unconvincingly cruel Kingpin.  The script short changes the dialogue for the villians but more than makes up for the intimate interactions between Ben Affleck's and Jennifer Garner's characters.  This is the movie's saving grace.  Affleck plays a convincingly somber Daredevil who serves justice to the common man by taking the lives of the guilty.  Despite his physical blindness, his other senses have become extremely amplified and gives him the perceptive powers to fight crime.  He lives his life through revenge and violence.  His alter ego is a lawyer who defends only innocent people or people he knows to be innocent.  This biased character flaw is was makes his dark nature so convincing and deeply touching.  What he cannot see, he feels very strongly.   <br /> <br />Besides his late father, there is a strong love for Elektra, the lovely socialite aptly played by Jennifer Garner.  And definitely not to be outdone by her secret superhero lover, Elektra seems to hold her own as a martial arts expert (gotta give tribute to the Alias complex).   <br /> <br />So what is it about Affleck's somber nature and Elektra's survivalist instincts that brings this pair together and make them feel strongly for one another?  A chance for hope, maybe? Whatever it is, the chemistry works well between them and very convincingly, with or without the superpowers. <br /> <br />Don't be fooled by the trailers.  There is less action going on in the story than appears, but this is still worth a watch. I give a C for the action, but A for the romantic intimacy.
B00002Z88D|5.0|this cd is awsome...i'm both a fan of metallica as well as classical music, and to hear them together is spectacular...although some songs like battery, sandman, sad and one don't work well with the orchestra, it really adds another demension to classics like ktulu, puppetz, bleedin', nothin' and especially, for whom the bell tolls. there are two new songs, no leaf clover and minus human, and clover is probobly the cd's best. the only proboblem was the abscence of tracks like fade to black and the unforgiven to name a few. I would love for Metallica to make an S and M 2 after their next album.    S and M 2  Disc 1  1  the ecstasy of gold   2  the unforgiven  3  creeping death  4  welcome home (sanitarium)  5  where the wild things are  6  disposable heroes  7  don't tread on me  8  ride the lightning  9  the god that failed  10 st. anger  11 orion  Disc 2  1  turn the page  2  to live is to die  3  harvester of sorrow  4  am i evil?  5  four horsemen  6  leper messiah  7  the unforgiven 2  8  ...and justice for all  9  the unnamed feeling  10 dyers' eve
B00005U122|5.0|Picked this up for 9.99 (at another major retailer, but that's hardly the point, 11.99 is a great price) yesterday, got home and popped it in.  <br />Starts out with \\"In the Flesh?\\" and you can clearly see that Waters is having a blast being on stage performing.  The sound quality on this first track seems to waver at points; almost made me think the whole disc was going to sound this way and be a \\"one-timer\\" (one watch).  NO WAY.  I was wrong.  If you're a die-hard Floyd fan, order it now, you won't be disappointed.  170 minutes of classic PF with a few of Roger's songs added to the mix.  His guitarists switch leads and each do a fantastic job of emulating the sound of David Gilmour and if you close your eyes, this IS Pink Floyd.  I'm not going to get into the track listing, you can get most of it from the other reviews and from the companion CD's track listing; but believe me, it's worth every penny.
B000268QB2|3.0|this album is good for reading, doing taxes, laundry, driving with a full load of people in the car at low volume, and taking a bath.  <br /> <br />honestly, anyone could but an album like this together. there isn't anything new or special. however, i do love melodic stuff. if you like melodic stuff, then this is a good album for you. but do yourself a favor and listen to Oasis first.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Deadpan, dry humor. This movie is addictive. I highly recommend it if you love a different kind of movie!
B000002VJH|4.0|I'll betray my age right from the beginning by saying the strength of this CD lies in its first \\"side\\" -- referring to the old LP format, of course. From \\"Help on the Way\\" to \\"The Music Never Stopped,\\" the Dead blast away with an energy they rarely found in the studio; the best of these songs are no less than NIMBLE, and that's saying something for this band. The \\"Help on the Way\\"/\\"Slipknot\\"/\\"Franklin's Tower\\" axis alone would be enough to recommend this disc -- and that medley of tunes became an absolute monster in concert. But \\"King Solomon's Marbles\\" weighs in to show off a band that was feeling its rhythmic oats, thanks in part to the return of Mickey Hart to the fold after an absence of about three years. And the Weir/Barlow \\"Music Never Stopped\\" really works as a summation of everything the Grateful Dead stood for: Individual identity flourishing within committed community.  <br /> <br />And then we come to ... Side Two. Arrgghhh. \\"Crazy Fingers\\" has not worn well musically for me, though Robert Hunter's haiku lyric construction still intrigues. \\"Sage & Spirit\\" is, in my opinion, a somewhat tepid instrumental, though with some beautiful melodies. But I think the \\"Blues for Allah\\" suite almost redeems the second side; it's challenging music, to be sure, with all the Middle Eastern sounds and atmospheres. Yet the closing \\"under eternity blue\\" motif is one of the most uplifting, purely spiritual pieces this band ever did. <br /> <br />To sum it up: I'll take this album over anything else the band did in the studio in the 1970s. If you're not that into the Dead but want one great disc from each of the band's three decades when they were making studio recordings, buy this for the 1970s, \\"Workingman's Dead\\" for the 1960s and \\"In the Dark\\" for the 1980s.
0670033375|1.0|Don't be fooled by Diamond's apparent objectivity. This book is first and foremost a critique of Western European culture by a scholar imbued with left-wing bias and anti-European prejudice.  <br /> <br />Collapse finds its inspiration in cultural relativism, the academic dogma of absolute racial equality, luddite, anti-technological environmentalism, and most of the other hackneyed left-wing rubrics. <br /> <br />Most dogmatic political works are boring in the extreme and when one realises that Collapse is indeed a political book, it attains all of the arresting allure of a Barney the Dinosaur book. <br /> <br />If I might give an example, there is Diamond's analysis of the Viking settlement in Greenland. According to Diamond, the Vikings, although in possession of superior technology which initially allowed them to exploit the environment of Greenland significantly more successfully than their Innuit rivals, ultimately perished because their cultural arrogance would not allow them to assimilate survival strategies from the Innuits whom they considered to be barbarians. Result, Vikings perish and disappear from Greenland whilst the despised Innuit flourish and remain.  <br /> <br />The message we are supposed to come away with is, of course, that Hey! Western European civilisation may have massive technological superiority, but unless we open our borders and change our culture to bring it more into line with African, Asian, and Middle Eastern culture, Western Europe and America will become extinct, just like the Vikings right? <br /> <br />Diamond is, of course, completely ignorant of Viking culture and civilisation and is consequently 100% wrong in his analysis. The Greenland colonists did not perish. They re-emmigrated to Iceland and Norway. The Greenland colony never was a great success due to  the harshness of the climate. The Greenland colonists did not choose to perish because they despised Innuits as sub-humans, they chose to return to a land where they could raise cattle and pigs, grow corn, make beer and weave cloth, rather than munch raw fish and live in snow holes.  <br /> <br />In an opus which claims to present a unified field theory of why civilisations collapse, it is laughable that Diamond does not actually mention one single recognised historical civilisation. No mention of Rome,Persia, Egypt, the Mongols, the Hittites or Ancient Greece. What we get instead are a couple of tiny islands in the Pacific, a wierd jungle theocracy and a fringe offshoot of Amerindian expansion. With the possible exception of the Maya, none of Diamond's examples can even be credibly described as a civilisation. The Easter Islanders and the Pitcairn Islanders had customs, they did not have culture, and were not civilisations. <br /> <br />Diamond's theory is so preposterously based on biased sample, false comparison and extrapolation from insufficent evidence that it would be highly hilarious if it were not for the fact that our modern universities are producing graduates who believe that this codswallop has intellectual merit.  <br /> <br />

Siddartha uses his skills of waiting, fasting, and thinking as he easily accomplishes mortal goals yet struggles for true immortality and peace.<br /><br />While this book is about a spiritual jounrey, I did not find the book spiritual in itself, and if you're looking for spiritual guidance I don't think you will find it here.  That was my only problem with this book -- that it sometimes took itself to be of higher spiritual value than it actually was.
B00062IVKS|5.0|I'm talking about Martin Scorsese.  If he doesn't win an Oscar for directing The Aviator, and he probably won't, his legions of admirers won't be any more disappointed than they were in 1981 or 1991 when he was overlooked in favor of Robert Redford and Kevin Costner, respectively.  (Redford is a class act and gave Martin a plum role in \\"Quiz Show,\\" but as for Costner...)  Anyway, Martin's award is this: tell just about anyone that he hasn't ever won, and they are flabbergasted.  Stunned.  And this movie, Raging Bull, is one of the reasons why.  Having seen muddy, murky VHS copies and an OK DVD in past years, this version is a revelation.  Disc 1 gives you the movie with 3 outstanding commentary tracks.  Scorsese is always engrossing and entertaining with his remarks, and he always seems like just a big movie fan instead of an ego-driven director.  Because Scorsese is, above all, a collaborator and not a dominator.  He gives those who help him realize the vision plenty of credit.  And that includes DeNiro and Pesci, in some of the most convincing and breathtaking acting you'll ever witness.  People take these two actors for granted these days, and perhaps they've been overexposed, but remember--this was Pesci's first movie with DeNiro and Scorsese, and only his second movie overall.  With all respect to Goodfellas and Casino, I think this is his best performace (Pesci).  DeNiro--what can I or anyone say about this legendary portrayal that hasn't been said?  Just marvel at it.  One of the bravest performances committed to film, up there with Brando in Last Tango in Paris.  This is where DeNiro, in fact, confirmed that he is Brando's heir, especially by recreating Marlon's On the Waterfront speech--\\"Could've been a contender.\\"  One interesting thing I learned in the commentaries and documentaries was that except for DeNiro, most of the actors in the movie were newcomers or relative unknowns.  As an ensemble, they are brilliant, another example of Scorsese's directing brilliance.  Special Features: For me, the commentary tracks are the best extras because they allow you to see the film from multiple perspectives.  The documentaries are nice, but much of the information overlaps, a common problem in DVD documentaries.  As for the quality of the movie transfer, I've seen the film probably two dozen times prior to this release, and I saw and heard new things as I watched the discs.  For instance, the checkered pattern in Pesci's suit when he's talking to DeNiro by the swimming pool in the rain is sharp and vivid.  That's just one small but significant example of how strong this new version is, aesthetically.  I've always been, well, knocked out by the use of sound in this movie, and not only can you hear the effects better than ever, the documentaries and commentary explain how the effects were put together.  Also, when you're not watching the movie, the packaging is beautiful.  It's like having a new edition of a classic book with first rate binding and printing on your shelf.  Sorry to gush, but this is almost a holy relic, something that fits with Scorsese's abiding theme of anguish and redemption through violence and blood.  Favorite scenes: the second Robinson fight; the home movie sequence; Jake wins the title; Jake loses the title; and, a quirky one, fat Jake setting up a tower of champagne glasses and filling all of them by pouring champagne into the top glass and letting it overflow like a fountain.  The unique touches like that are what set Scorsese/DeNiro apart and take this film into the atmosphere of the sublime.  Also, before I forget, Nicholas Colasanto, later of Cheers where he played the beloved but not so bright Coach, shows up here as a neighborhood mobster who is both gentle and lethal.  His scene with Pesci in the \\"Debonair Social Club\\" is brilliant, with Colasanto conveying barely restrained anger and frustration.  Beautiful performance.

B000059ZT4|5.0|Many reggae fans have long villified Island Records head honcho and, according to Lee Perry, vampire, Chris Blackwell for adding additional instrumentation to this album's original tapes in order to pander to mainstream Western tastes. The fact is, the Wailers themselves were intent on breaking reggae worldwide and reportedly approved of Blackwell's \\"enhancements\\". Whatever the case, the listener can be the judge with this collection. <br /> <br />Disc One features the original Jamaican versions of the songs that were to eventually comprise \\"Catch A Fire\\". These tracks are generally more raw and immediate than the official Island release. In some cases, there is little variation between the two. In others, the differences are quite notable. Many consider the originals to be the definitive versions. Also featured are two bonus tracks, including the beautiful \\"High Tide Or Low Tide\\" which was originally made available on the Marley boxed set. <br /> <br />Disc Two, of course, is the released album complete with Blackwell's sonic \\"tinkering\\". I honestly feel that each disc is crucial. The Jamaican tapes offer a rock solid foundation for the tasteful contributions of some ace studio musicians. They hardly turned \\"Catch A Fire\\" into a mainstream rock album. Rather, they added some rock flavor to what is very much an uncompromising reggae album. Take, for example, John \\"Rabbit\\" Bundrick's clavinet and Wayne Perkins' guitar parts during the intro of \\"Concrete Jungle\\". Rather than detracting from the original version, their parts contribute to the the song's overall intensity and sense of desperation. Perkins' guitar solo is simply incredible and, again, only adds to the song's dramatic flare. Elsewhere, Perkin's slide guitar parts (and especially his solo) on \\"Baby We've Got a Date\\" are unexpectedly effective while Bundrick's etherial synthesizer on \\"Stir It Up\\" elivates this tune to a higher plane. <br /> <br />Compare the two discs for yourself. Both are 100-percent enjoyable, in my opinion.       <br /> <br />
B00008OLIO|5.0|***** - FIVE STARS <br />=================== <br /> <br />The heaviest, raunchiest, coolest Crue you can buy..... <br /> <br />Not even \\"Shout At The Devil\\" could top this. This release defined a generation of kick ass 80's Metal. It still stands the test of time today as well.... <br /> <br />Regardless of Motley's \\"Hair Metal\\" lable, this came out at a time when there was really no such thing. Nobody knew what a \\"Hair Metal\\" band sounded like, and I personally classified this as Punk / Sleaze Metal. \\"Too Fast For Love\\" was the rawest of the Crue days, and when thay were at their most impressive in my opinion. Nothing they did after this hit me quite the same.... <br /> <br />The early days of Crue were truly untouchable. This is where it all started, and if you don't own this, you really can't call yourself a fan in my opinion..... <br /> <br />CUZ I'M ALIVE!!!!...... <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002UDB|5.0|I know that all of you doubters out there don't like this album, the movie, or the Beatles.  Well I'm telling all of you that this album is terrific.  The movie of the same name is only for the hard-core Beatles fans such as myself.  But the music can be enjoyed by all.  The tracks are truly wonderful.  This, and Pepper was them at the peak of their psychedelic powers.  Fool on the Hill, I am the Walrus, Blue Jay Way, MMT, Your Mother Should Know,  and all the rest are great songs.  It's great fun.  I've loved this album since I was a little kid, and if you give it a chance, I'm sure you'll love it too.  Don't be put off because of the movie because that has no effect on the quality of the writing genius that was Lennon/McCartney, and Harrison.
0316172324|5.0|Blink discusses and describes the value of intuitive thinking, but it explains that intuition is not ESP but the result of a vast amount of knowledge and experience properly ordered to facilitate an immediate \\"still small voice\\" (my quotes, not Gladwell's) of certainty that we should heed.  Gladwell goes on to explain what happens when intuition seems to fail, and why, and how to avoid that.  He uses as an example of failed intuition the tragic shooting by police of Amadou Diallou and the analysis is superb.  His chapter of facial recognition and discerning exactly what someone is feeling or thinking from the briefest flickers of expression is worth the price of the book, which is a fascinating read superbly written.  Never dull, informative, highly useful.
0451191153|3.0|I read this book after completing Atlas Shrugged.  I started the Fountainhead keeping in mind that since it was written earlier in Ayn Rand's career than Atlas that it probably was going to be less refined, and perhaps less articulate in its philosophies.  I was correct.  Atlas Shrugged in my opinion is brilliant, and it has assumed a position on the top of my favorite books list.  However, Fountainhead i felt was rather boring in comparison, and far less powerful.  None of the characters possessed any real charisma that made characters in Atlas Shrugged such as Francisco D'anconia and Hank Rearden so memorable. Fountainhead also lacks any truly poignant scenes, resulting in a mesh of seemingly meaningless events making up the story.  Roark's speech at the end in the court case is the only moment that is comparable to the radiant brilliance of Atlas Shrugged, and for the most part is the only piece worth re-reading in the book.
B0001A79JO|1.0|I bought this album because I am always in search of bands who are adding something new and different to the genre of psychobilly and rockabilly.  The Horrorpops definitely have the look and the correct musical geneology via Kim Nekroman, but they lack the power that is associated with the genres.  The Horrorpops are a bit boring and contrived, even for novice listeners.  The most vivacious track is the single, \\"Miss Take\\" which in and of itself has overtones of the Nekromantix song \\"Demons are a Girl's Best Friend\\".  The band has potential in future recordings to redeem itself, and certainly have the talented lineup to do so.  As of now, \\"Hell Yeah\\" is unfortunatly not your best introduction to the wonderful genre of psychobilly and/or rockabilly and I wouldn't recommend it to the people who know the ins and outs of the genres either.    I do however recommend old Nekromantix, Mad Sin, Batmobile, the Meteors, the Guana Batz, Chibuku, the Krewmen, Hayride to Hell, the Phantom Rockers, Demented Are Go, the Kryptonix, the Klingonz, the Bleeders, and the female-fronted bands The Tantrums and Pearl Harbor and the Explosions.

What people need to do is know how Jimmy acts and is, being anoying is his character, and must know that some poeple think its funny including me. His next upcoming film is Fever Pitch with Drew Barymore

B0006SSOHM|4.0|I've been eagerly anticipating the release of this DVD for some time since I missed it when it was out in theaters. I had heard all the bad press it got but refused to believe Danny Glover would make a bad movie. My opinion was proven right but his character is a bit obsessed in this movie. He plays one of the cops chasing the Jigsaw Killer. After seeing his partner be murdered, quite brilliantly I might add, he becomes obsessed with finding who the killer is even after being discharged. He is convinced that a man named Lawrence is the killer and stakes his place out. That's all I will say about his character. The movie starts off amazingly well, two men wake up in a room chained to pipes with a dead body in the middle of the room. It progresses rather quickly with Lawrence, a doctor, explaining about a few of the deaths to Adam. It may just be me but I didn't find Cary Elwes' (Lawrence) acting to be very believable at times. Leigh Whannell (Adam), however, was very convincing and made his character very understandable. The plot is about as good as you get in this day-and-age. A cheap rip-off of Seven? Maybe. But this movie is executed very well. It keeps you guessing throughout, even when you think you have everything figured out. The deaths featured in the film are gruesome and extremely raw, a nice visual compared to other movies' deaths. This movie also contains one of the best endings to a psychological/horror movie I have seen, you're jaw will be on the floor. Overall this movie is very enjoyable and doesn't stoop to the cheap scares as you might expect. The horror mounts throughout and is more in the atmosphere of the movie because you know what might happen and you just dread the thought of it. There's not enough movies with that aspect to it anymore, so for that alone, this movie is worth it. Worthy acting and a great plot only makes this movie better.
B000002MTR|5.0|It's true that Navarro's playing on this album changed the sound of the band drastically, BUT, as great as all the other albums are, if you can look past the fact that it isn't anything like you'd expect from the Chili Peppers, this is an amazing compilation of music... Now, after saying that, it still contains most aspects that make the Chili Peppers great. The mix of funk, punk, rock, and fun that's been the defining Chili Peppers sound on all albums before OHM, is still there, just with an added experimental kick... Great album, pick it up.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Smokin' hot Buble is smokin' hot again on It's time. <br />Wasn't sure where he'd go with this record but he took it up into the statosphere - sky high strong bigband sounds or sweet soft strings and always, yes always that incredible voice!! <br />Caught the Letterman show and he tore it up with Feeling good.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Alot of reviewers already commented on the many inaccuracies of this film when compared to Homer's tale so I won't even go into that. If you've read the Iliad this movie will irritate you. Overall, Troy is an ok action movie. Average acting covered up by eye-catching sets and costumes. Peter O'Toole is great as Priam and Brad Pitt makes a fine Achilles. However the rest of the cast wasn't too impressive. Maybe I can't blame then though because the screenplay was lacking. Especially notable with the romantic scenes between Paris and Helen. Yuck! And yea, Diane is cute but the \\"most beautiful woman in the world?\\" I think not. Anyway, the main reason to see this film is the battle scenes, particularly the showoff between Achilles and Hector. In my opinion, the climax of the movie and one of the best sword fights I've seen on film. Of this genre, I'd have to say Gladiator is the more perfect movie, not only because the plot flowed easier, but the atmosphere was enhanced with Zimmer's original score. Again, you might want to see Troy once but after that it loses appeal.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|this movie is the biggest piece of crap I HAVE EVER SEEN!!! i cannot stand the main actor or any of the rest of the cast. people love this movie cuz its stupid. i think their stupid. [...] Don't buy this if your smarter than a fly.
B00004BZ0N|5.0|I will go on a limb here and call \\"London Calling\\" a ROCK classic, not a PUNK classic. Why? Because the album experiments more than Clash albums in the past did. It's hard to call songs like \\"Wrong 'em Boyo\\" and \\"Brand New Cadillac\\" punk songs, or the mainstream classic (and their first ever charting single in the states) \\"Train in Vein\\" a punk song. However, that doesn't take away from this album at all. In fact, it proves that the Clash were expanding their sound.     Those that love the Clash for punk songs will love the songs included on \\"London Calling\\" The title track, \\"Clampdown\\", \\"Spanish Bombs\\", \\"The Guns of Brixton\\" and others are typical punk faire from the band. Even songs like \\"Lost in a Supermarket\\" are clever, in how they use silly lyrics to portray social and political concerns. One of the biggest strengths of the Clash was their ability to install messages into their songs using inane lyrics. That makes their music appeal to a broad range of listeners.    People who compare this to Blink 182 or Good Charlotte are way out in left field. The influence, the topics, the musicianship, and the variety of sound puts the Clash in a class of their own. Pick up one of the great albums of rock TODAY!
B000002GVO|4.0|Consider a song lyric called THE BOXER. Written by Paul Simon. Most of THE BOXER is a first-person narrative. It's a confession of despair & self-pity spoken by a washed-up loser in the entertainment business: \\"I have squandered by resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises.\\" But the final part of THE BOXER shifts into a third-person narrative: \\"In the clearing stands a boxer and a fighter by his trade. And his carries the reminders of every glove that laid him down and cut him till he cried out, in his anger and his shame: 'I am leaving, I am leaving.' But the fighter still remains.\\" The narrational shift in THE BOXER could possibly be interpreted as a psychological defense-mechanism on the part of the narrator. The boxer's defeat is too painful for the boxer to narrate in the first-person. So he objectifies himself with a third-person perspective in order to gain the necessary distance from himself. <br /> <br />Well, I couldn't help but notice that NEW KID IN TOWN does the opposite shtick. NEW KID starts off in the second-person, addressing \\"you\\" as the subject of the lyric. But then it pulls a switcharoo near the end and shifts into the first-person: \\"There's a new kid in town. I don't wanna hear it.\\" The cat is out of the bag. The narrator was pretending to talk about you, but he was really talking about himself.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Even though the critics reviews are horrible, every single person I have talked to has loved this movie. I have seen it 3 times in theatres. Gerard Butler ( the phantom ) uses so much emotion in his voice and really puts you into the story. The story is incredibly moving and heartbreaking. The music is beautiful.The costumes are dazzling. Everything is done so beautifully. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes musicals, and romances.
B0002234LS|5.0|This movie is so exiting!!!Even though I knew who it was from the begining. It wouldn't even let me pause it and go get popcorn! I recomend this movie to everyone! Exept people under the age of 11.or 10.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This album by Green Day is definately their best album yet, and that is saying something because all of their albums are great.  From start to finish it keeps you going.  In my opinion the best song is Holiday or Boulevard of Broken Dreams, but all of the tracks are great in their own way.  American Idiot ranks up there in my top three favorite albums of all time.
B000696PWC|5.0|I listened to Kylie Minogue's Ultimate Kylie and this is much better than Hits+!  I was just floored after hearing all of it. The album came out in the US on Feb 1, and I immediately got it that day!  She put a lot of songs from her first album Kylie, especially Locomotion and Je NE Sais Pas Pour Quoi.  The first 10 songs were of the familiar Stock Aitken Waterman late 80s hit formula.  Some of their songs sounded so very alike, especially with Kylie's, Donna Summer's and Rick Astley's with the bridges and shifting sections and landscapes. Loved her fun remakes of Celebration, Give Me Just a Little More Time and the impressive Tears on My Pillow.  I missed out on Kylie's hits between 1992 and 2000, but this album makes up for it with Spinning Around, which I love, Confide In Me, Please Stay and others. Obviously I still love Can't Get You Out of My Head, Chocolate, In Your Eyes, Slow and the two 2004 songs she made for this album.  But the most dramatic and best from Kylie is her duet with Nick Cave.  It is such a fabulous ballad to close off this mostly dance heavy collection. Kylie gave Madonna a run for her money on many of these songs with the dance tracks and sex appeal.  I hope that Kylie continues to have more hits in the future, because this collection shows her at her very best as an artist!
0060555661|5.0|This book has taken me through one of the biggest crashes in market history and the following recovery over the last two years or so. Although written decades ago, Graham's ideas and his presentation is so clear, it all still makes sense. Thoughts and ideas presented in this book can be put to immediate use as you go through the book. Building the discipline to actually become the 'Intelligent Investor' might take years. <br /> <br />I have read this book a few times over and each time have taken away things and thoughts that summed up define what is now my investment philosophy.

B0006B29Z2|4.0|I avoided buying this for a while. Anytime I see old footage and do NOT see 5.1 Digital Dolby, I suspect the worst. Still, with a holiday gift card in my hand and Iron Maiden love in my heart I made the leap. <br /> <br />Disc One: 3.5 stars <br /> <br />Right away I was amazed. I simply could NOT believe how good \\"Live at the Rainbow\\" sounded! I mean if this old show sounded like THIS I was in for a real treat. Not being a fan of the D'ianno era I was still interested from the aspect of history. Then the \\"Beast Over Hammersmith\\" started. I thought it sounded a bit over done but I dialed my sub woofer down a bit and was generally pleased with the results. I patiently sat through some duplicate songs... waiting for '83. I mean Live at Dortmund was a later show right? The sound was bound to be killer right? Well, it was terrible! Sour mono mixed with periods of the tape being eaten or stretched, you choose, but I was decidely diappointed, especially when I heard snippets from this very show on the interview portion with a very NICE pseudo \\"surround\\" (like the first two concerts!). I'm not sure what happened here, but it's quite obvious not enough care was put into this. <br /> <br />Disc Two: 4.5 stars <br /> <br />To say the interview left no stone unturned would be an understatement. I learned so much about how the band was formed and saw so many past members I came to the conclusion most of England at one time was a part of Maiden:) At any rate, my 4.5 stars are definately devoted to the interview which spans 90 minutes and 91 members. It's not without its faults though; they spend way too much time discussing what Steve Harris had for lunch and not enough about why key members left. Still, I love the effort. The rest here does little for me. Never fancied Maiden videos and the rest here is just filler. <br /> <br />Conclusion: If you are looking to rekindle your love for Maiden, look no further. If you too are afraid of the sound quality, rest assured there are better sounding bits out there but nothing captures the essence like hearing the guys that actually created it perform it at the time it was created. It's true, you can't go home again, and that sentiment could never be truer than with music. Cheers to Clive Burr, they should have spent more time with him, both now... and then.

B000750OEA|5.0|If you love Kylie Minogue, as I do, this is a must own DVD.  The 2+ hour disc is packed with over 30 videos spanning Kylie's impressive 15+ year career.  The DVD also includes a live performance of \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head.\\" It is hardly her best performance of the song but is just an extra on the disc.  The videos are the stars of this DVD.  What a treat it is to watch Kylie progress from cute and innocent in \\"Got to be Certain\\" and \\"Locomotion,\\" to hot and sexy in \\"Red Blooded Woman\\" and \\"I Believe in You.\\"  Virtually every video is fun, spirited, and will bring a smile to your face.  The only exception is \\"Where the Wild Roses Grow,\\" a critically acclaimed video about a man murdering his lover.  Normally, this video would seem out of place.  In reality, it is a brilliant masterpiece in itself.  This is a wonderful collection and should be owned by every Kylie Minogue fan.
B000002HFU|5.0|This is one of the best rap albums of all time. Death to all you haters of ODB. And death to you hip hop \\"elitests\\" who say that people who consider this album one of the best say that only because ODB is dead. You're just as bad as the ODB haters. All the songs on here are excellent. They might not be considered skillful, whatever that means, but they're enjoyable, funny, raw, and witty. When I first heard these songs, like Shimmy Shimmy Ya, Baby C'mon, and Brooklyn Zoo, I thought ODB was rhyming off beat. After hearing them all many times, I have come to realize there actually is a complex rhyming scheme to them. It sounds kind of sloppy, but there really was thought put into it. Just listen to them a lot. I think you will see if you already haven't. Brooklyn Zoo is one of those songs that gets you really pumped up. Ol' Dirty is the most original rapper in my opinion. He can entertain so well that I bet a lot of his fans aren't really sure why he's so entertaining. Maybe because he goes all out. One of the strangest and best songs on here is Dirty Dancin' featuring Method Man. It made me feel like I was in some kind of evil carnival where madness is the norm! The songs on here range from hilarious to raw and relentless. I don't see how this album can't entertain anyone, unless you really hate hip hop with a passion. Get this album! It's so varied that you won't get bored of it. It's one of my favorites. <br />P.S. I only have one thing to say to that reviewer \\"Helen\\" who reviewed this cd on Jan. 8. Look at her reviews. She listens to Nelly and gave his cd 5 stars. LOL! Enough said.
1592400876|2.0|I think if I found her humor funny then I would appreciate the book better.  She does speak the truth, I would prefer it without so many attempts at humor.  Then again, the subject matter probably needs humor otherwise you would fall asleep.
B00000JGEH|5.0|You get a very interesting Horror/sci-fi film that stamped James Camron, and Arnold Schwarzenegger around the world.<br /><br />This movie is about Sarah Conor(Linda Hamilton) who's unborn son will be the turning point of the war with the machines.  But the machines refuse to go out like some chumps.  They send a rithless machine, the T-model 101(Arnold Schwarzenegger to waste her like a coke can.  This is the only time you'll see Arnold as a ruthless mo'fo but it's undeniebly an unforgettable performance.  But the humans send one of their own, a human who knows the situation.  Cyle Reese (Michael Biehn) is sent to protect her, but the million dollar question is, can they do it, or will they be ruthlessly slaughtered by the heartless machine.<br /><br />The one thing I like about this film, is the fear it presents.  It seems nothing that Cyle and Sarah do can stop him, not even a police force of 30 men with shotguns and assult rifles even stalled this baaaaad dude.  It makes the Terminator feel almost invincible.  Even the dated special effects at the end, where the terminator looked fake, made him look scary.  If he moved realistic, I dunno, but with him moving fake, accually mad him look scarier.<br /><br />Arnold in this one is the scariest out of the terminators, because the protagonist wasn't a machine, but a human.  T-1000 is the best because liquid metal seemed nearly indutuctable.  The T-X is just, well T3 shouldn't have even been made.  I mean T3 made the hairstyles on the wemon in this film look sexy(Well maybe)<br /><br />James Camron's carrer was made, and Arnold's carrer skyrocketed way up.  This may have been low budgeted, but high hearted.  This film is second to the clerverly made sequal that continued the plot so flawlessly, and this film makes T3 look like junk.  Anyone who loves sci-fi or horror, go check this out.  Anyone who saw T2 but not this, need to check out the begininer.<br /><br />peace
0316172324|2.0|I would recommend one borrow not purchase this book, and after the half-way point return it.  I found the first half extremely interesting and captivating.  The remainder loses the reader in a case with racial overtones and fails to establish a logical relationship with the first half.  I read a comment by another that seemed apropos: describe a new method of building an office building by explaining briefly a new building method and what the building might look like when finished.  And, then talk about some of the surrounding pavement, you'd have \\"Blink,\\" well--in a blink.
B0002XDODU|5.0|After their masterpiece \\"Mutter\\", Rammstein comes with a new album which maintains the same high quality, alltough the pacing is a bit slower. <br /> <br />Indeed there's a larger amount of slower songs on this album, but this doesn't weaken the album. In fact, it's variety is one of the albums strenghts.  <br />Next to \\"traditional\\" heavy songs such as \\"Mein Teil\\", \\"Keine lust\\" or \\"Stein um stein\\", Rammstein brings us the acoustic bluesy (!) song \\"Los\\" and the love-ballad (!!) \\"Ohne dich\\". Both songs are absolutely amazing and show that Rammstein can do anything. <br /> <br />My personal favourite is the song \\"Dalai lama\\". It's a perfect bland of great lyrics (they're based on a poem by Goethe) and perfect atmospheric music. And the chorus never fails to send shivers down my spine. Very good song indeed. <br /> <br />And of course we have the more poppy sounding \\"Amerika\\", which is NOT a political song by the way. It's a general statement about the American culture spreading all over the world. In a very ironic, tongue in cheek way (like Rammstein always does). Wether that's a good or a bad thing is up to you to decide. <br /> <br />To sum things up: Rammstein again delivered a great album with lots of variety and very strong songs. Very recommended.
B000006OAM|5.0|Listening to the radio, I fell in love with \\"Life is Sweet.\\" I bought this CD to hear that one song and didn't care about anything else. It was only after a few lazy moments when I was unwilling to switch CDs that the rest of this amazing music came to me. <br /> <br />Each song is hauntingly beautiful. Each track evokes something familiar. Hearing them is like rediscovering a secret that was first whispered to you long ago.  <br /> <br />Late at night when the house is quiet, I play this CD. It is extremely soothing and it allows me to write with a clear head.  <br /> <br />James Green, author of \\"If There's One Thing I've Learned.\\"
B000002LIM|5.0|Sometimes a composer perfectly captures the essence of a super hero in a movie score.  John Williams did in Superman, and Danny Elfman does it perfectly in Batman (as well as Spider-Man).  His dark brooding main theme is a perfect springboard for the movie and his fast paced action score makes the listener feel like they are actually in Gotham City.  PLus Elfman allows the music to turn from dark and mysterious to insanely whimisical when dealing with the Joker.  Since Batman, Elfman has scored several super hero movies, including Batman Returns, Hulk, Spider-Man & Spider-Man 2, but it is the score to Batman that he creates a perfect super-hero score.
B00004RJ74|5.0|Sometimes there are things in life we really like, but we don't admit to it. Maybe it's disco or pro wrestling or prunes. Whatever it is, you love it in secret...for fear of what others might think.  <br /> <br />For me, this film is one of my guilty pleasures. Sure, there are a million campy things in the movie that we could point out if we wanted to, but why go to all that trouble? This is a silly, campy, fun, frightening, exciting, and sexy film. I watch it a few times a year, especially if my friends drop by. <br /> <br />Whenever people tease me about liking this film, I always stand my ground. If it's a woman who does the teasing, I say something like, \\"Hey, it's all just for fun.\\" If it's a man who teases me, I take a look to the left...a look to the right...lean in and say, \\"Hey, Salma Hayek does a dance sequence in this film that will change your life.\\" <br /> <br />James Green, author of \\"If There's One Thing I've Learned,\\"
B000059ZT4|5.0|When the Wailers were signed to island records in 1972, this marked the beginning of reggae to an international audience. The Wailers were already famous throughout the Carribbean, but worldwide they were nobody's. Catch a Fire changed all that. This was packaged as a rock album and the original album sleeve was actually a zippo lighter and when you opened the lighter the record would come out. This artwork is not original. The sound tapes were actually overdubbed with rock giutars and other instruments to make this album appeal to an American and English audience.  <br />The first disc is all the original Jamaican takes which are better then the overdubbed ones released originally to the world in 1972.  The original Mixes have such a feel to them, and you can really appreciate why this band was so big in the Carribbean.  The Wailers first album has a feel unlike any other Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, or Bunny Wailer solo album.  the three of them together were simply amazing and no vocal trio will ever equal how good this band was.  With the Barrett brothers on drums and bass and a young Tyrone Downie on the keyobards, this band was well on the path to stardom, and Catch a Fire was the start. If you have a music collection, you need this Deluxe Edition in your collection.
B0000VAFO0|5.0|If a film is good, I don't care if they try to impress me. Underworld is a fine example of such a film. Kate Beckinsale's character Selene moves in such a way as to guarantee that her full length leather coat will billow and swing perfectly. Her hair dangles in her face in a perfectly planned but seemingly accidental fashion. Her slow motion moves are a carbon copy of those we've seen in other dark and futuristic films, but I didn't care. I wanted to see more. <br /> <br />Michael Sheen-the actor who plays Lucian, the leader of the Werewolves-is perfectly cast. He has an amazing intensity and an elegant speaking voice. Whereas you might expect the leader of a pack of animals to be rough and barbaric, Sheen's Lucian is steady, controlled, and often soft spoken. <br /> <br />This is a very enjoyable film with a fairly original premise. I heard there were plans for a sequel. Sign me up. <br /> <br />James Green, author of \\"If There's One Thing I've Learned.\\"
B00005Q5WC|5.0|Exodus (the movement of JAH People) was time magazine's album of the century, that should say enough right there. But if you are not convinced buy it and you will be for sure. This album was released in 1977, and was recorded in London England. Bob Marley and members of the band survived an attempted assination in December of 1976, and went into self imposed exile in London. Here the creativity of the band is quite good, and many of the Songs that you know by Bob Marley and the Wailers appear on this disc. Jamming, Exodus, One Love, Three Little Birds, and Waiting In Vain. All the tracks are great on this disc and you can hear for the first time in all of the Wailers recordings that the quality of the recording equipment here is much better. The dummer's (Carlton Barrett) high hat never came through so clear. This album marks the intro of Junior Marvin (lead guitar)to the band. The band was about to gain superstar status and this album marks the beginning. <br />The second disc features some live tracks from the 1977 tour and the songs slected for the release happen to be from the 1977 Rainbow theater concerts, which will also be availble on dvd very soon.  The live performances really come through and prove that the band has a tremendous vibe live and that while in concert they most certainly bring their best.  the Lee Perry tracks are rather rare and are very nice to listen to.  the booklet that comes with the cd can provide more insight into them and how they came to be, but just know that it is not the Wailers backing Bob on them, rather musicians from other bands. At the end is a Bob Marley promotion of the album for radio which is really nice to hear.  If you are questioning yourself about this set or the single disc edition, this set offers a more diverse selection, and the bonus tracks and bonus disc are really a great addition tot he album of the century.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This has been a film that has touched so many people in so many ways. I was especially grateful to have the oportunity to go see the film(3 times.I had listened to the music for years without ever having seen the play or any version of the movie, and to finally see how the story play's out was absolutely fantastic! I do hope that their will be an opportunity for the play to run in the south, we do have an appreciation for arts as well. I have spoken with many people over the year's and most have had the opportunity to see the play and have always gave the play rave reviews,and all agree that this film has been the best on screen they have ever seen!It has a younger fresher edge to it. Hopefully this will touch the younger generation that \\"love\\" does come in many forms,and that what is or can be romance does not have to be vulgar. I found it to be the most fabulous film of a lifetime. I have taken the liberty of telling everyone i know just what they will miss if they dont go to see the film! I have also taken full advantage of ordering my personal copy in advance from amazon.com. I truely hope that at oscar time this film get's everything that it and the actors and everyone involved with the film get what is well deserved!
B00003000M|4.0|It is nice to see modern musicians still paying homage to a great man.  This is not really a reggae album, but it is unique to see how each modern artist puts their spin on each song and turns it into their own without taking it too far off from what Bob had intended.  It would have been nice of the original Wailers in the band would have had a bigger part, but overall this cd has some pretty good work by some modern artists.  Get this cd if you want a twist to the workings of a great man.
B0000013GT|5.0|this is the highest peak of artistry and human achievement possible, i'll never be this cool but i keep trying.
B00005KB9W|5.0|Live! from 1975 marked the introduction of Bob Marley and the Wailers to the mainstream in Eurpoe.  The smach hit No Woman No Cry from this album is a song everyone knows, reguardless of where they are from or what type of music they like.  This is not a full show, but rather songs taken from 2 nights at the Lyceum in London.  The sound is good quality, but at certian points in the recording you can tell that the venue and or the recording equipment are probably not the best.  For a first live album this is very good.  All the songs have a greater power live than in the studio.  You can really tell the band stepped it up for these performances, and the vibe they give off here to the predominately Jamaican audience in London is right up there with any other Bob Marley and the Wailers concert.  Many of the band members recall the Lyceum shows as one of the many highlights from the decade.  The performances buy the Barrett brother's (bass and drums), AL Anderson (guitar), Alvin \\"Seeco\\" Patterson (percussion), Tyrone Downie (keyboards), The I-three's (backing vocals), and of course Bob Marley are simply jaw dropping.  The band is at it's best, and if you like powerful concert performances, this cd is one you should not live without.
B000005HLV|5.0|Ok, ok... This release is overhyped, I admit it. If you look at it now, in contrast to the early 90's, this is extremely genric BM. Whirlwind and mercyless blastbeats, grim guitars, blah blah blah... It may not be as ground-breaking or emotional as Burzum's works, nor have the technical merits of early Satyricon releases, but none of those releases would be here today if it wasn't for this album, and that's the plain truth! <br /> <br />Somehow this album's brutality is unbridled and raw, and nearly endless, but the atmosphere given off by this album is indescribable. The freezing guitar riffs, echo-filled drums, and strange vocals may seem silly compared to the obscure BM of bands of today, but it most likely made huge impression in the golden days of the Norwegian BM scene. Euronymous uses his distinct guitar tone to create a grim, \\"necro\\" atmosphere, and Hellhammer pounds his kit relentlessly on songs like \\"Pagan Fears\\" and \\"Buried by Time and Dust\\", while leaving room for complex and intricate rolls on \\"Life Eternal\\" and \\"From the Dark Past\\". Of course, I couldn't go without mentioning Attila's outstanding vocals; It's impossible to describe his style... Somewhere between the blowtorch and agonized shrieks of Dead and an opera singer lies Attila. Some call it silly, but I think it fits the music perfectly, and creates an obscure atmosphere. His peak performances are on the awe-inspring title track and the BM anthem \\"Freezing Moon\\".  <br /> <br />The production here isn't totally clean, but isn't anything akin to \\"Transylvanian Hunger\\", either. It's raw, but perfectly captures the live essence of all the musicians. <br /> <br />1. Funeral Fog- Amazing guitar work here, a Mayhem classic. 5/5 <br /> <br />2. Freezing Moon- A BM anthem, no Mayhem setlist would be complete without this. Great guitar solo, and Attila's vocals will send shivers up your spine. <br /> <br />3. Cursed in Eternity- An average track, I'd say. Not bad, but not really ear-catching either. 3/5<br /> <br />4. Pagan Fears- Features that guitar line that every metal fans knows by heart. The constant blastbeats get a bit tedious, which almost ruins the song, but the strange vocals make up for it. 4/5 <br /> <br />5. Life Eternal- A haunting dirge in memory of Dead, Mayhem's previous vocalist. This is a mid-tempo song, giving Hellhammer room to show off his intricacy on the kit. Amazing guitars, and even better vocals. 5/5 <br /> <br />6. From the Dark Past- Starts out alright, but kind of slides downhill afterwards with monotone guitars and irritating drumming... But Attila does very good here. 3.5/5 <br /> <br />7. Buried by Time and Dust- Total Necro! A speedy and haunting anthem with mercyless drumming and flurry-speed guitars. Ultimately Brutal!! 6/5 <br /> <br />8. De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas- Amazing... A hypnotic main riff, intricate drum work, and Attila is at his best showing off his operatic vocals. One of Mayhem's best songs ever. 5/5 <br /> <br />If you're starting a BM collection, THIS is the place to start. Grim and necro, but oozes with atmosphere, just like real BM should. Truly essential.
B00005KB9R|5.0|This is the last album by the trio who started out as the Wailers.  After this album tensions amoung the original Wailers (Bob Marley, Peter Tosh, Bunny Wailer)proved to be too much and they broke up.  But this album released in 1973 was the Wailers greatest work.  the trio prefectly compliment each other on the classic I Shot the Sheriff and the fine Get Up, Stand Up.  On Burnin' unlike on Catch A Fire, each Wailer gets a few of their own songs performed even though Bob Marley still takes many of the lead vocals.  Burnin' is mainly some of the band's older songs re-worked with some new tunes that are quite catchy.  All the songs have excellent harmonies and phat instrumentation, and to no one's suprise, the Barrett brother lay down some great grooves.  This album presents the Wailers at the peak of their powers.  No real music fan should be without this album, and if you want more Wailers, check out the Burnin' Deluxe Edition and you'll have a chance to hear the Wailers live at Leeds in England and you will be amazed at the vibe this band gives off in concert.  This is one of those albums that if you don't listen to it before you die, you'll really be missing out.  Make sure you add this to your music collection, even if you aren't a reggae fan.
B000002UB3|4.0|Picture this: one evening you're at home, listening to what is now your favourite Beatles album (Abbey Road), which you have been listening to nonstop since you asked out your lovely girlfriend. Then, on a whim, you whip out what was formerly your favourite Beatles album (Sgt. Pepper), which was the album of my life as a bachelor, and suddenly you're going nuts, IMing your girlfriend and begging her to sing you something from Sgt. Pepper, all the while saying, \\"I used to think it was such an innocuous question which album I liked better!\\" <br /> <br />Well, we ended up breaking up (for MOSTLY unrelated reasons), and I think Sgt. Pepper did end up being my favourite, but that's just how much this music can become a part of you. <br /> <br />When talking about Abbey Road, I try not to pick and choose songs to suggest. Simply put, listening to the album all the way through is an experience. This might even be viewed as a weakness, since the total is so much greater than the sum of its parts. It makes it pretty hard to break down the album and analyse it. Abbey Road is basically pure enjoyment. <br /> <br />I make one exception, however. There is one song on the album that I feel is a cut above the rest. Surprisingly, it's not one of the more famous ones like \\"Something\\" or \\"Come Together\\". In my opinion, the best and probably most underrated song on the album is...\\"You Never Give Me Your Money\\". It is that song that completely represents that era of beauty in my life, where out of despair inevitably comes hope, and geniune joy.
B0000669JL|5.0|Chances are, if you have heard a Bob Marley and the Wailers cd playing it is probably Legend. This set is a nice casual introduction to the band that started the worldwide reggae movement. it was released in 1984 3 years after Bob Marley died, and includes many hits that you are probably familiar with. Songs from all the albums are not included here which is the only downfall of this disc. The booklet that comes with the cd is a good way to learn about this legendary man and his band the Wailers. The Wailers are one of the most talented groups of musicians ever, and the instrumentation and variety on this disc proves it.  <br />
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I wish they had not cancelled this show. The first season was excellent and showed a lot of promise for the future. Oh well....
B00005MKA3|5.0|This album was released in 1979, and the most amazing thing about it is how the percussion instruments stand out.  On no other Bob Marley and the Wailers album do the percussion instruments stand out so well, they almost take a lead part themselves.  This can be attributed to the increasing technology in the recording industry possibly, or maybe a change in musical style for the Wailers. The band is still as good as ever and rhythms here on Survival will prove it, the basslines and other musical harmonies will pleasantly ring throughout your head and bring a smile to your face. This album promotes African unity, and African freedom and is quite possibly the most militant of the entire Bob Marley and the Wailers catalog.  All the songs have lyrics that will stick in your head for years to come, and if you are looking for a place to start your reggae or music collection, Survival is a great place to start.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|It seems that nowadays when I see movies (I am 49 y/o) I am always able to relate plot, character, setting to something else I have aleady seen.  I thought there was nothing new - nothing fresh - no surprises left.  Until I saw Napolean Dynamite.  There is nothing like it!  It held my interest from start to finish and left me wanting to know what happens, or doesn't happen, to him next.  What a great character - he's so UN cool - he's cool!  Ya gotta love'm - and if ya gotta love Napolean - well then...... <br /> <br />I watched this movie with my two sons - ages 12 and 7.  I love any movie that shows the importance of getting to know someone and then of accepting ideosyncrasies. The importance of having good friends and helping them when they need it.  The importance of not taking yourself too seriously and of following your heart, of not putting too much importance on what others think of you.....and the list goes on! <br /> <br />This is a GREAT movie.  We rented it - I am going to go buy it tomorrow!  You gotta see this one - you just gotta!   <br /> <br />P.S.  Don't fish for catfish in L.A. and keep watching AFTER the end credits roll! <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B00005J9U1|5.0|The music and instrumentation on this disc is unbelievable.  I would reccommend this over Legend if you could only buy one Wailers disc for your collection.  The set covers all of the Albums from this musical genius' career and really shows why his cd's are still selling 25 years or so after his death.  This cd covers more than Legend and in my opinion is better.  The booklet tells you a little about each of the albums, so if you like a certain few songs and how they sound, you can go and buy the album and get more of the same type sound.  One Love offers a few rare songs like Iron Lion Zion and I Know a Place. This disc is probably the best start to learning about Bob Marley and his amazing band the Wailers.
B0006399FS|1.0|I love music alot, but I never understand how everyone can love U2. It seems like they make a record, everyone loves it, then they disappear for awhile and repeat the process. While away, all you hear is how great U2 is and how they are one of the greatest rock bands to ever grace earth. I dont understand U2, ill admit they have good songs here and there. Why is Bono considered a music god? His music is not the greatest ive ever heard, and I dont know why it seems the world bows at there feet.
B00002R0MC|5.0|I was very pleased when island decided to re-issue this set.  Originally released in 1992 this sold out very quickly and a few years ago island decided to put it out again.  don't let this set pass you by.  The first disc starts out in Bob's early days and goes right on up to his death.  Rare 12\\" mixes and demos and outtakes are included in this set.  Redemption song is form Bob Marley's last concert with the Wailers in Pittsburgh in 1980. In my opinoin, it is the best live version of Redemption Song. There are no downfalls or quibbles to talk about for this set, every track is a classic, and you can listen to it over and over again.  If you want to just buy one Bob Marley and the Wailers set, this should be it. A great set that includes many great songs and nice instrumentations, no reggae fan should be without this set. The booklet that comes with this set is also a nice bonus, you can become a Wailers expert overnight.  If you listen to this set long enough, you'll become a Wailers addict for life.  I guarantee it.
B00005JMJG|1.0|This movie is pretty bad. Don't waist your time watching it. <br /> <br />The story isn't very captivating and the plot drudges. I thought they would bring it all together at the end with some type of moral, but that never happens and you're left with two hours of nonsense.

B0006IIKS0|5.0|Metallica's Some Kind of a Monster is a great documentary and a funny one too. Since Metallica hadn't made an album or gone on tour for several years, when the filmakers makers heard they were recording a new album they just had to make a film about it. Through the tough and hard process of making the record, the film makers also show the rough pass of Metallica through the loss of Cliff and Jason leaving the group. A great dvd with over 5 hours of Metallica footage. Though I was quiet disappointed by this film. I thought it was a film about like when Metallica started and how they got so big. I wish someone would have told me that it is a documentary about the new album. This film sounds like an MTV special. But it was still a great film and it got 5 stars because of the film and the features.

If you are not a big Wailers fan but rather a first time listener, get the single disc edition.  If you are looming for a little variety and some interesting mixes, this set is for you.
6304779356|4.0|You can totally tell this is an oldish film because of the 'fuzziness' of the picture (^-^) but it doesn't stop this film from being an absolute classic.<br /><br />This may have been scary at the time, I have no idea, but it certainly isn't anymore. Most of the violence is laughable, especially the staking of Alex Winter's character. That doesn't make it a rubbish film though.<br /><br />It's definitely a bit of an MTV film, even having MTV mentioned in it.<br /><br />Just try this film out and if you don't like it, fair enough. But at least give it a try.
B00005KB9X|5.0|This is Bob Marley's first album without original Wailers, Peter Tosh and Bunny Wailer.  Instead to provide the backing harmonies, Bob enlisted his wife Rita, Marcia Griffiths, and Judy Mowatt to give backing vocals.  The Barrett Brothers still hold down the rhythm section, and Touter plays some catchy keyboard.  This album marks the intro of the only american to join the band, Al Anderson on guitar.  Bob preferred the rock type sound to reggae, and Al Anderson was the man he was looking for.  Some of Bob Marley and the Wailers greatest songs in concert come from this album which was released in 1974.  Songs No Woman No Cry, Lively up Yourself, Them Belly Full, Rebel Music, and on later tours Natty Dread and Revolution. This solo debut album isn't as good as former Wailers Peter Tosh (Legalize It) and Bunny Wailer (Blackheart Man)debut albums, but this is still a great cd to own.  Strangely, no songs from this disc appear on Legend, but all the songs still have superb instrumentation and nice melodies.  This album is probably only for the reggae fan, but is still one of my favorites.
0440224764|4.0|Like many said here, the beginning of the book was kind of boring but things picked up rather quickly when Patrick starts to tell the truth. The ending however, was very very disappointing..how and why would the girl Eva do such a thing like this to the man she loves or loved did it mean that money finally wins??? And what about her dad? is she going to ditch her dad as well since she knows that Patrick knows where her dad is and she knows that he'll return to Brazil..this is just not making sense here...<br /><br />Despite the bad ending...this is a good read.
B000002UJQ|5.0|For a long time now Radiohead have attracted the sort of fans who adhere fanatically to their every move with the sort of rabid fanaticism usually reserved for celebrity stalkers. This curious sociological aspect of their fan base manifests itself on this website. Clearly some people can't bear the fact that dissenting opinions about this album have been posted here.<br /><br />The fact is, controversy is frequently associated with classic art - whether it be music, literature, paintings, plays or whatever. It is only bland, unthreatening works that attract solely smiling positive reviews. Hard hitting, original offerings such as OK Computer naturally split opinion - between those who consider it to be a highly intelligent musical critique of contemporary corporate life and those who contend that the unique sound patterns and vocals incorporated by Radiohead on this album are merely exercises in esoteric, pretentious soundscaping.<br /><br />There is nothing wrong with this. Forums such as Amazon exist so people all over the world can post their views on a range of products. There is no set standard so it is inevitable that some opinions, both positive and negative, will be well informed, some less so. The British writer Martin Amis opined that the internet has democratized the literary scene to such an extent that it resembles a garden, with hundreds of people trampling across its verdant lawns. But no matter how many people desecrate this territory with their novice critical forays, great literature survives. And this is surely the case with the music scene too. I am sure Thom Yorke doesn't frustratedly check his browser every morning, baffled at why OK Computer only averages 4.5 stars where as perceived lesser albums garner a perfect 5. The point is, bands such as Radiohead are bigger than this, classic albums such as OK Computer transcend the hundreds of vox pop style opinions posted on the internet.<br /><br />Amazon is supposed to be a forum where people can gain a better idea of the products available by the reviews of customers. In the case of certain products it has become a fan site for those who seem unable to tolerate a dissenting opinion. Calm down guys. Refusal to tolerate contrary opinions is one of the central tenets of totalitarian political theory. Everyone is entitled to their view - when in the history of art has public opinion ever managed to bring down a deserved classic work in the long run? Greatness ultimately prevails, regardless. OK Computer can handle criticism on this site, trust me.the products available by the reviews of customers.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen this movie four times already and am ready to see it again!  Gerard Butler was incredibly sexy as the Phantom and made me wonder why Christine would pick Raoul over him! Even though it was Emmy Rossum who was nominated for the Golden Globe (and it was well-deserved), Gerard Butler truly moved me in a powerful way and he should have been nominated as well.   <br />
B000001DQI|5.0|This is one of the best albums of all time. Music has no boundaries, and it's just what Elton John seems to prove with this wonderful bunch of great songs. They are timeless and ageless. From the fantastic \\"Funeral for a Friend\\" to the tender \\"Harmony\\", without passing by the real hits: \\"Candle in the Wind\\", \\"Bennie and the Jets\\" or \\"Saturday Night's alright for fighting\\", the whole album is a gem!! New lovers of music, here is what your ears have been waiting for!!
B00005JKWJ|1.0|I was sooo bored in the theater when I went to go see this with my bf, who liked the first one. The theater only had 4 other people in it and by mid-movie, only 2 were left. I think they were sleeping. Speaking of mid-movie, by then I was so bored I was actually looking around for something to do. Yes that's how restless I was getting. Good vampire v.s underworld of vampire evil. Now I love vampire movies, but this was bad. But you know, at least my bf was transfixed; when he pried his eyes off the screen he knew that was the last time he'd pick a movie. and yes; he thought it was a pretty good movie. Ahhhh! <br />Anyways, the whole thing was really dark lit(obviously, and very redundant- even the fight scenes. Fight to get to the big bad guy, he gets away, plan for another day, all over again.
B000001EXB|2.0|For me, this is just a British singer with a bunch of good songs, but let's not fool ourselves with this one. THIS IS NOT ELTON JOHN!! I mean, which is the best song here?? \\"Recover your Soul\\"?, \\"The Big Picture\\"? And what about the 80% of the album?? Believe me, I am one of the most devoted EJ fans from Venezuela, but I have to tell you that this record is depressing!! Even \\"Leather Jackets\\" is a masterpiece compared to this one!! Sorry....
B000002J03|4.0|i recommend this album to Zeppelin fans who aren't only into their greatest hits but also like to listen to their lesser works.  Led Zeppelin influenced and INVENTED metal.  also if you like this album, you should also check out Led Zeppelin III.  This isn't their greatest album, it's much more subtle then Led ZeppelinIV.  If your just getting into Zeppelin, DO NOT START OFF WITH THIS ALBUM! get Latter days 1 & 2.  Also, if you are looking for something hardcore and angry music, this isn't a very angry album.
B000001EGA|5.0|What a wonderful recording! Plenty of good music for all likes! From the sweet and mellow \\"Writing\\", the country-flavoured \\"Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy\\", to the rock-n-roller \\"Meal Ticket\\", the album is excellent!! This is just to prove that \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" is not only his best album. This is the landmark of his career! Highly recommended!!!
B000002UAU|5.0|...with Beatles - Revolver, a close 2nd. <br /> <br />If you have listen to music at all, then you should go out and buy 'Sgt. Pepper's' if you haven't already. Go out and do it. I saw the CD at Target for less than $10.  <br /> <br />If you think about it, you're not just buying one album but you're buying several. So many classic rock artists said so themselves in magazine articles and in interviews, that they used Sgt. Pepper's as inspiration for their album.  <br /> <br />If I could only have one CD for the rest of my life, this would be it.
B000000WF0|5.0|Great album... <br /> <br />1. Bittersweet Symphony-an excellent britpop anthem even though it was written by the Rolling Stones, well done anyway.   5/5 <br /> <br />2. Sonnet- good but not quite as good as the first song 4/5 <br /> <br />3. The Rolling People-good rocker, a little drawn out though 4/5 <br /> <br />4. The Drugs Don't Work-in my mind one of the best love songs of all time 5/5. <br /> <br />5. Catching the Butterfly-this song stands out a lot in the album, but is still one of the best songs. very creative 5/5 <br /> <br />6. Neon Wilderness-sounds cool although there isn't much going on lyric wise. 4/5 <br /> <br />7. Space and Time-great song 5/5 <br /> <br />8. Weeping Willow-my personal favorite, exceeds the charts 6/5 <br /> <br />9. Lucky Man-another great song that made me want to learn the guitar part for it straight away. 5/5 <br /> <br />10. One Day-starts a little too slow, but builds up to overcome it completely. 5/5 <br /> <br />11. This Time-good song, pretty catchy. 4/5 <br /> <br />12. Velvet Morning-took me a few months to appreciate this song, but I do now. 4/5 <br /> <br />13. Come On-I'm not sure I would've used that song as an album closer if I knew my band was breaking up within the next year, but still great. 5/5 <br /> <br />I advise everyone to buy this...NOW! It won't let you down. <br />
B000000WCA|3.0|Oh, the fickleness of fame. The Spice Girls, like many other pop bands before and after, learned the hard way that you can't expect the people who worship you today (8-year-old girls desperately in need of a role model, in this case) to still adore you tomorrow. And this is even truer when you're a pop band, because teenyboppers have ever-changing tastes. Some artists have enough talent and guts to reinvent themselves, which allows them to keep their career afloat (like Madonna, for example). Not so with our beloved Girls. None of them, with the possible exception of Mel C, had either the voice, dance moves, writing and managment skills or wits (actually, Geri can be considered the smartest one since she quit before it was too late) to garantee their career's longevity; even a brilliant marketing strategy consisting in exploiting the concept of feminism to sell countless derived products to gullible pre-teens wasn't enough to prevent the disaster that occurred in 2000 : the unescapable (and predictable) demise that followed the flop of their last album, Forever (which is a very ironic choice of album title, if you want my opinion). In fact, the Spice Girls are nothing else than a joke that stopped being funny a long time ago. I'm sure even the Girls themselves know that. <BR>That being said, you can't ignore their impact on pop music and the fact that, in the late 90s, they were a cultural phenomenon whose success made them big enough to be compared to the Beatles (they were even referred to as the Fab Five, at some point). Unfortunately, the big difference between the Spice Girls and the Beatles is that for the Girls, their success was all about the image, not the music. Nevertheless, Spice is a fun album, with extremely catchy songs, and I'm not afraid to admit that I still like to pop it in my CD player from time to time. So what if it's generic, bubblegum pop? So what if the lyrics are sometimes downright ridiculous? The Spice Girls were manufactured for us to get up and dance and have fun. Fun, my friends, is what Geri, Emma, Victoria, Mel B and Mel C were all about. And now that they all went their seperate ways to struggle to pursue a solo career, I think it's safe to say that Spice cannot be as &quot;harmful&quot; now as it was nine years ago.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Honestly, I have to say, over the past few albums Green Day has put out, they have consistently gotten worse. I also think that the pinnacle of their \\"terribleness\\" has occured with this one. One of the main things that is plainly idiotic is the fact that they are trying to be \\"controversial\\" with this music when the only people who I see listening to this as not a novelty are boys 10-15 years of age or girls 13-18 years old. Even if an older, more concious member of society let this pile of rubbish scrape itself through their ears, they would care nothing of being called an \\"american idiot\\". I sure don't care. I'm sure people believe they are cool listening to it, but the rock of truth will soon hit them in the head... it will hurt, BADLY. I can also see in this album the fact that they are making a bad attempt to change their sound which sucked enough already. I honestly thought I would never see the day when Green Day wouldnt just bang the hell out of a guitar and see what would happen, but I did, and I have to say that it was still quite pathetic. That brings me to another point, why did they have to play so uncreatively all those years? Seriously, if you compare the talent of Billy boy from Green Day to say Noel Gallagher from Oasis, you would have one of the most talented rock and roll guitarists around today (Gallager) vs. a wet match in a dark cave (\\"Billy\\"). I can't tell you how sick I am of people actually praising this. It's not worth the $15 you will waste on it...trust me. I can't stress this enough. Its safe to say that Green Day was playing the joke on themselves, and they are the true \\"American Idiots\\".
B0000029DD|5.0|There's a time when you're down and out, and along comes a soundtrack so beautiful it makes you almost glad to be alive. At times reminiscient of Beatles' later work, at times just plain surreal, disregard the acoustic guitar jang-janging that screams ''heart full of soul'', and the album's Victorian romanticism, atmosphere and drunken confessions will hit you smack in the face and end up somewhere at the back of your skull. By which time you should be hooked. 'Hallelujah', a Leonard Cohen cover, is sheer beauty, while original Buckley-penned songs like 'Grace', 'Last Goodbye', 'Lover, You Should've Come Over' are intense tracks with words so imploring and real it's almost painful to hear him utter them. ('Last Goodbye': Why can't we overcome this wall/ Well, maybe it's just because i didn't know you at all/ Kiss me, please kiss me/ But kiss me out of desire baby/ not consolation\\") This is the only album Buckley made while he was still alive, and it's the stuff of wistful dreams and heartbroke melancholy. It's easy to dismiss Buckley off as just another tragic artist who died young, but ignore him at your own peril.
6304493681|4.0|FYI, both the original DVD and the Special Edition are missing the original ending song.  Also, I have seen pictures comparing these two version.  They look exactly the same, and I mean exactly.   <br /> <br /> So in the end, I would recommend buying the Special Edition over the original if you dont already own this film, otherwise the original DVD is just fine.   <br /> <br />  The movie itself is great.  Short and sweet with some beautiful visuals and gun battles.  Defintely not for young kids though as there is pervasive nudity, but absolutely no sex.
B000002UAO|5.0|When I was in college, a buddy of mine and I had beatles bonding sessions on the weekends.  She would come to my dorm room with her copy of rubber soul, place it in my CD player and we would sing all the songs (from start to finish) at the top of our lungs.  Listening (and singing along) to this album was like a natural high for us.  Highlights for me were norwegian wood, Think for yourself, michelle, Girl and in my life.  But of course, all of the songs on this album ROCK!!
B000683VI4|4.0|Is love politically out of fashion? You'd think so reading some of the reviews of \\"The Notebook\\". Many critics scathingly dismissed it, more or less, as a vehicle strictly for romantics - those quaint, uneducated people who, unaware that love is a fiction, happily wallow in `sentimentality'.  <br /> <br />Well, to tell the truth, I am not a romantic. My personality is ill-suited for a life long relationship. I am, in fact, quite content to go my way by myself most of the time. And, yet, I HAVE known couples who have been faithful, loyal companions for decades and decades. I HAVE known couples for whom the romance has never ended. I think \\"The Notebook\\" is a fair reflection of how these people are. While all of the events probably would not be experienced by one couple, many of them have been experienced by some lovers, up to and including the movie's `ultimate' happy ending.  <br /> <br />The film opens in an obviously expensive nursing home. An old man called Duke [James Garner] spends a lot of his time reading from a notebook to an Alzheimer's patient named Allie [Gena Rowlands]. The notebook is a love story. It begins in North Carolina in 1940 when a rich girl [Rachel McAdams] from Charleston, SC meets a local boy named Noah [Ryan Gosling], who works in a lumber mill. She's vacationing for the summer with her parents. A torrid summer romance ensues. Both the vacation and the romance are cut short when the girl's snobbish mother [Joan Allen] realizes what is going on.  <br /> <br />It turns out, of course, that the notebook is really the story of the old couple in the nursing home. It is Duke/Noah's way of reaching out to his beloved wife. How that summer romance is rekindled is a fascinating story on its own.  <br /> <br />The key, perhaps, to the success of \\"The Notebook\\" is in the superb acting by all four of the lead players. All are absolutely believable in a movie which needs to synthesize 60 years of love into two hours.  <br /> <br />Frankly, I am not surewhy we don't believe in love in the movies. God knows we believe in absurdly violent tales, ridiculous fantasies aimed at children, impossible sci-fi stories, impossible depictions of famous people and laughable scenarios about macho sports figures.  <br />
B0001YFPKK|5.0|Many bands (the Beatles, the Beach Boys) at least dabbled in psychedelica, but the Zombies are often overlooked. For the 30th anniversary of \\"Odessey and Oracles,\\" the Zombies' best album was rereleased in a new form, proving that their enchanting psychedelic pop has aged exceeedingly well.<br /><br />The Zombies were unusually good at taking perky, sweet, lush music and wrapping it around a more serious song, such as the upbeat \\"Care of Cell 44\\" (guy writing to his jailed girlfriend), or the lovely \\"A Rose For Emily,\\" a poignant little song that tells of a lonely woman doomed to stay lonely. \\"And as the years go by/she will grow old and die/The roses in her garden fade away/Not one left for her grave...\\"<br /><br />But the Zombies aren't all sadness wrapped in happy music. There are perky songs about being happy in love, losing a love and hoping she'll return, and reminiscing about \\"golden days and golden summer nights.\\" The album ends on a reassuring note with the laid-back \\"Time of the Season,\\" which sounds like the ultimate hippie anthem.<br /><br />I have no memories of the 60s, since I was only born in the eighties. But \\"Odessey and Oracle\\" gives a rosy glow to that era,. Psychedelic flair minus the hazy, and every song is a gem. Though \\"Time of the Season\\" was the sleeper hit from the album, it's not the best or catchiest song on here -- it's just one of many excellent ones.<br /><br />Rod Argent was definitely an outstanding songwriter. He was able to create atmospheric and beautiful songs with very simple writing (\\"Brief candles in her mind/bright and tiny gems of memory\\"). Perhaps his finest moment here is \\"I knew he when summer was her crown/and autumn sad/how brown her eyes,\\" as a kick-off to a colorful look at a woman compared to all the seasons.<br /><br />Colin Blunstone's vocals were well-suited to the music: a bit husky, quite pleasant and mellow. The music itself was generally based on guitar, gentle drums, pretty piano, and wavering Mellotron, with a bit of accordian coming in in one song. There's a rich interweaving of many instruments, in all sorts of pop music. Some is almost classical in tone, some is uptempo stuff that is perfect for the radio.<br /><br />The Zombies were in peak form in \\"Odessey and Oracle,\\" churning out some of the purest pop music ever.

B0002IQL30|5.0|While British rock band Muse are big in the UK, the US is only just starting to get acquainted with these original, entrancing musicians. And their second album, \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" they accomplish the almost impossible -- every song is epic and thrilling.<br /><br />The first two songs open with delicate rippling piano intros that suddenly blossom into rock riffs. Feedback kicks off into sizzling basslines and riffs in \\"Plug In Baby\\" and \\"Citizen Erased,\\" while wind chimes and an acoustic melody are at the heart of \\"Screenager.\\" \\"Hyper Music\\" is the only dud. It's a discordant clatter that becomes a discordant rock song -- nuff zed.<br /><br />But as good as most of the album is, Muse save the best for absolute last. The penultimate song \\"Feeling Good\\" is perhaps the best -- fuzzy chopsticks start the song, followed by a stretch of epic rock and soaring vocals. The finale is no less entrancing, a slowly stately wave of sound that slowly transitions into an equally rich rock song.<br /><br />Americans really got to know Muse through their latest album, \\"Absolution.\\" But it's not the only album they have done, nor is it the best. \\"Origin of Symmetry\\" may well take that honor, or at least tie with their debut \\"Showbiz.\\" Relatively few people know about these earlier albums, or about the rich apocalyptic quality of Muse at their best.<br /><br />Muse is definitely a band for Radiohead fans -- it has the same rich spaciness and art-rock quality, but it's more grounded and gritty. The most entrancing instrumentation is done on piano -- it can be delicate, dark, fuzzy, or outright epic. The piano is accompanied by smashing percussion, sinuous riffs and basslines, and sweeps of spellbinding electronics.<br /><br />Matt Bellamy puts his good vocals to use in every song, and he's as versatile as his piano. Much of the time he opts for the smooth, low sound. But he also gets to howl, and occasionally sounds like he's been huffing helium. And the songwriting is also pretty solid, often focusing on betrayal and a lover who \\"was so beautiful.\\"<br /><br />Muse deftly dodged the sophomore slump in \\"Origin of Symmetry,\\" a soaring rock epic that won't be fast forgotten.

B00009Z576|5.0|Great album. Only the Edge is better. It's a shame this line up with Trevor Horn didn't make any more albums together (although Horn produced 90125). The orginal was only 30+ minutes but with the bonus material it's definetly worthwhile. Yes, this was the begining of corporate Yes, but it still rocks. A must have for any true Yes fan.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|You could treat it as a showcase for a fiendishly talented trio. Muse make enough noise for a football team of musicians, spanning 11 octaves, innocence to corruption, new beginnings to bitter ends. Always a band to rely on their live charisma, the trademark Muse walls of sound are reproduced here in abundance by Rich Costey: The distortion on Chris Wolstenholme's bass guitars fills the few gaps Dominic Howard's crashing drums leave, and Matt Bellamy's famed guitar/keyboards astound with their complexity as well as their volume.  <br /> <br />But there is aching clarity and intimacy too: Falling Away With You gets in so close that you hear the lick of Matt Bellamy's fingers on the fretboard. And his vocals, which have matured somewhat from Showbiz and Origin of Symmetry, still remain pure and choral in Blackout, angst-ridden and betrayed in Stockholm Syndrome, or act as another instrument in the space orchestra.  <br /> <br />If there is a weakness, it's probably the lyrics, which do not approach the creativity of the music. But it's inconsequential, because after the first wave of dizziness from Absolution's aural onslaught, your heart will be thumping. It's no one-play experience, though; Absolution has enough layers for repeat listening and even the occasional finger-clicking. You need this melodic, harmonic hysteria now. <br /> <br />~ <br /> <br />Hopefully this will spell the end of all comparisons to a certain other British band from Oxford, and good riddance too. Absolution's lyrics may deal with dark issues, but its uplifting sound invokes a whole different mindscape from any alt. rock you get today. Or yesterday. Read some previous reviews carefully and you will find that the 'copycat' accusations are superficial, heightened by sentimentality.  <br /> <br />I too am a Radiohead listener and fan, but am not so nostalgic that I would randomly credit them for all of Muse's (considerably more dynamic) output. Painful as it is to admit, Yorke & co. never invented the things they are worshipped for today, only stamped their peculiar brand of bittersweet self-loathing onto it. Good for them. But let's be realistic, folks (and in the process allow ourselves to appreciate Muse into the third dimension rather than nitpick on one). People have criticised far less the other bands who borrowed more from Radiohead, but didn't have the vocalist or songwriter to withstand scrutiny.  <br /> <br />Why go so hard on Muse, who push harder against technical and ideological boundaries of what rock can achieve? Why go so easy on Yorke's often erratic vocals, or Radiohead's inability to take guitar music any further? You're doing your ears a disservice by continuing to travel a Bends/OK Computer rut.  <br /> <br />This is the kind of blind hope that sent Kid A soaring to the top of the charts in 2000. For every 1 person who bought the record genuinely enjoying the horror trip of abstruse atmospheric electronica, 1000 bought it on memories of OK Computer and have been making up explanations for it ever since. These same people, in a spasm of self-loathing for having enjoyed Muse, then begin to see Radiohead in everything. I should know, I could've been one.  <br /> <br />So please let this be the last time someone talks extensively about the Oxford fivesome. I love Radiohead for what they were, but enough is enough.

B0007TKNL0|4.0|Let me begin by stating the I love the stage production of Phantom of the Opera...it was my first musical and it has enthralled me ever since. <br /> <br />I enjoyed the movie and will add it to my collection when it is released but I really feel that sometimes stage cannot be duplicated on film and I think this is the problem here. The film is beautiful but at times it was unable to draw you in - my first problem being with the scene where the phantom takes Christine from her dressing room. The stage aspect of this is amazing with its dark visual and the music that is playing but the film was dull and unbelievable at this point. I think it was because it was borrowing from another movie with the intro of a horse but it just did not work. The scene started off great with them walking down the dark hallway with the candle light but then it just goes bad. <br /> <br />I also did not enjoy the graveyard scene where the Phantom is beaten in the sword fight. The point of the Phantom is that he is a man of magic...just when you think you have him - you realize you do not for he always as a way out.  All through the musical...he always has a way out. <br /> <br />I also had a problem with the actor they cast for the Phantom.  He was great but he was not the Phantom. The Phantom's ability to manipulate Christine comes from him being older and more experienced in the ways of the world.  This guy was working strictly on his sex appeal and I just could not buy that he was the phantom. <br /> <br />The young lady who plays Christine was very good and I enjoyed her performance. I also enjoyed Minnie Driver as Carlotta - she was very good and I loved the way she took the character and let us poke fun of her. <br /> <br />If you have not seen the stage production, then do yourself a big favor and see it first then see the movie...I think you will agree that on this particular musical - stage is better. <br />
B00007AJF9|1.0|There is nothing historical about this movie. I could go into a long list of the details, but here are just a few of the problems: <br /> <br />1) There was no dominating mood of rising Protestantism in England. Mary Tudor was EXTREMELY POPULAR with the English people, who were almost entirely Catholic and hated the newfangled protestant heresies. The only areas where protestant schism had any hold whatsoever was London and a few smaller cities. The general population had no problem with Mary and her council's execution of heretical rebels. <br /> <br />2) Mary DID NOT try to keep Elizabeth from the throne. Elizabeth was involved in an early plot to overthrow Catholicism in England, but when that plot was foiled, Elizabeth swore to her elder sister that she was firmly Catholic. Mary believed her, and died happily thinking that she'd left the throne to a strong Catholic heir. <br /> <br />3) Elizabeth was virtually impotent as queen. Most of the time, her orders were simply ignored. The country was essentially run by her chancellor William Cecil. A few examples provided by Hillaire Belloc: <br />     A: She had personally given her royal assurance to the Spanish Minister that the Spanish treasure ships bearing the pay for Alva's soldiers in the Netherlands, the ships which had taken refuge from pirates in English harbors, should be released and the money taken under safeguards to its proper destination. Cecil simply overruled her. He ordered the money to be confiscated and his orders were obeyed, not hers. <br />     B: She desired to save Norfolk. Three separate times she tried to stop the execution. Cecil overruled and had him put to death. <br />     C: She tried to recall Drake and stop England from declaring war on Spain. No one thought to heed her orders. <br />     D: The supreme example is the murder of Mary, Queen of Scots. We are often led to believe that Elizabeth faked remorse at having her cousin executed. This is totally false. Elizabeth was horrified.She did everything she could to stop Ceil from having Mary beheaded. Again, no one paid attention to England great, powerful, wise Queen Elizabeth, so legendary for her strength of will and character. <br /> <br />4) Elizabeth secretly held deep sympathy for the Catholic Church. As a young girl, she grew up amidst the cynical, elitist class of intellectuals who doubted Catholicism mainly because they wanted its wealth. Elizabeth was naturally influenced by such propaganda. But in time, she grew to understand just how villainous was the plundering of England's great abbeys and churches so that greedy nobles, disguised as religious reformers, could grow wealthier. It is said that if the King of Spain had launched an attack and seized England, she would have helped him.

B0006SSOHM|3.0|A well thought out little horror story with a great look for the budget and timeframe in which it was shot.......... the only negative drawback ?<br /><br />The 2 actors.<br /><br />Whenever the movie reaches a point where the terror/tension is reaching a peak, the 2 actors come across as comical and humorous instead of scared and terrified.<br />One gets the impression the 2 main actors kept laughing while doing the most horrifying scenes and the director/editor had to finally give up and splice together the scenes where they seemed to be cracking up the least.<br /><br />My wife for example kept asking me.... \\"Do you think they wanted this to be dark humor or something ?\\"<br />I replied \\"No.. the actors are trying to act extremely terrified, they just can't pull it off and come across like they are doing a spoof\\"<br /><br />If you overlook those acting ability limitations...the whole film as a package is well done.<br /><br />At least I stayed awake thru this film unlike the horribly boring and overated \\"GRUDGE\\", which I have no idea how anybody finds interesting.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|Gilmore Girls is my favourite show. It is funny, dramatic, smart, and addicting. I have watched multiple discs of both seasons 1 and 2 in one sitting- the perfect way to waste a day. Make sure to have a pen and pad of paper near your hand so you can write down people to look up, books to read, and songs to sample. Many people I know don't watch Gilmore Girls for precisely the reasons I do: 1) it moves slowly and 2) you often don't know exactly what the cast is referencing (hence the pen and paper). Examples include the poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Danny Kaye's \\"Pellet with the Poison\\" bit from \\"The Court Jester.\\"    If you haven't been able to \\"get into\\" the series on TV because you felt lost, thought they were trying to be too witty, or were just all bad actors (a common misconception!) you should invest in this, and learn the reason why \\"Oy with the Poodles already!\\" is part of my daily vocabulary.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Nothing slick and prepackaged here. A glorious mix from the days when being a true superstar was to be the anti-superstar. My favorite cuts are when they are at their blusiest best, like \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\".
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Having seen so many reviews on this site, as well as having seen the Broadway show twice, I feel the need to write my own review. Why? Because I feel that many people miss the point of the production.  The sets, costumes, choreography and yes, some of the lyrics, are whimsical.  This story is supposed to be from Oz.  Alot of things dont make sense there.  Look at the lyrics in the context of the story. I have been a loyal fan to the show for well over two years and have a deep respect for the show and its creators.  No the show is not flawless, but then again nothing is.  Its certainly not Sondheim, but i appreciate the simplistic aspects of the show which are wound around a tightly constructed, sinister core.  The cast, in a word, splendid.  Idina is a powerhouse, who sends shivers down my back and makes me incredibly jealous of her gorgeous, rocker, voice.  Kristin's voice appeals to me less, but she has a beautiful, operatic voice, that is a stark contrast to Idina's.  Popular is a gem.  Carolle Shelley got a little jipped here, but she is very amusing live.  Joel Grey is his usual cabaret self, he is a darker fiqure masked well.  However I should point out that while I love Joel, I prefer George Hearn who took over for him, but then again Im partial to my Sweeny, George.  Norbert is very good and his voice blends very well with Idina's.  Favorite Songs on the album- the Wizard and I, Defying Gravity, and As Long As Your Mine (top three only)  I would reccomend this to anyone who is open to \\"new\\" shows and to people who might be interested in theatre but are in the expirimental stages.  I hope this has helped.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I am 24 years old.  11 years ago I was in middle school and \\"When I Come Around\\" was one of the most popular songs. It was by a 'punk' group called Green Day, and I didn't care for their music.  I also didn't care for the song \\"American Idiot\\" the first couple of times I heard it.  Then, two things happened: 1) I heard the song \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" and 2) I watched the Grammys when Green Day won for Best Rock Album of the Year.  Both of these events inspired me to give this album a shot even though I had passed over it on endless trips to the record store.  To say that owning this CD is one of the best musical purchases I ever made is an understatement.  I was blown away.  First of all, the song 'American Idiot' does not represent the album as a whole. If it did, I probably wouldn't like it.  You too will soon discover this upon hearing the amazing, five-part, nine-minute, second song entitled \\"Jesus of Suburbia.\\"  It includes great musicality by switching tempos while telling a story.  The rest of the album picks up on that story, a theme about a kid named 'St. Jimmy' who struggles to find his own place among Idiot America until eventually commiting suicide.  It's a well scripted story and one that I do not take lightly.  Of course, we have all heard the critics (some of whom will not even listen to the album because of its' title) say that this album is not punk. To them, I say 'So be it.'  In countless interviews, Green Day has acknowledged that they needed to take a new musical direction.  One that made them enjoy being musicians by keeping it fresh, and more importantly, one that represented their AGE.  How could you possibly expect this group to produce the same 'angst-ridden' material at age 33 as they did at age 22?  Are you saying you still want them to create songs called \\"Geek Stink Breath?\\" Give me a break.  This whole album from start to finish is one of the best I have ever heard, and I am not even that big of a rock fan.  The highlight of thisalbum is definitely the song \\"Holiday.\\"  Not only is it the catchiest of tunes and the best song that band has EVER produced, it really can dig deep into your mind and has changed the way I look at my life from day to day.  It is hard to believe that this album came from a group that I thought was history after their greatest hits album came out 3 years ago.  Looks as though they will have to write a new chapter in that category.  I plan to be a huge fan now and will look forward to more masterpieces from a band that has taken on a whole new life.
0385510454|1.0|Although I had given up on John Grisham many years ago, I decided to give him one more try. Bad Mistake.  The Broker is another inane story with a lead character you just don't like.<br /><br />Grisham's early novels were his absolute best, i.e., \\"A Time To Kill\\", \\"The Firm\\", \\"The Pelican Brief\\", etc.  After that it seemed he just couldn't come up with a decent story line.  Maybe it makes sense though - how many novels can a person really write about attorneys that have likeable characters?<br /><br />This latest offering is even worse than Grisham's last ones.  You have a pathetic, totally unlikeable character who spends well over half the book with the reader learning the Italian language (very exciting stuff, I guess, if you happen to be learning Italian at the time).<br /><br />The plot simply reeks and is so illogical, even an attorney would have a hard time defending it.  Here's just one example. Ordinarily I'd worry about giving the story away but, not to worry, there is none.<br /><br />Early in the novel, lead character Joel Backman has just been released from jail by a questionable Presidential pardon.  In theory there is lots of intrigue here, but the gist is Backman has some very valuable information that many countries, including the good ol' USA, would love to have.<br /><br />The CIA, naturally, gets involved and tries to drug him in the hospital where he is getting a doctor's exam before he is released.  Our intrepid hero refuses to eat or drink anything, so the CIA eventually lets him go.  Then they set him up in Bologna with a CIA handler that arranges for an Italian tutor and an apartment. Then they bug and videotape his living quarters, and basically spend every meal and waking minute with him (except when he is allowed, for purposes of trying to save the storyline, to roam all over the city by himself).<br /><br />The point is, why doesn't the CIA simply grab him in Bologna?  They can drug his food anytime they choose to, or simply knock him over the head and shoot him full of truth serum and get all the info they want. Short answer - it wrecks an already wrecked story.<br /><br />This is only one of the fatal flaws this terrible novel has.  The rest are just as ridiculous.  The ending is the best thing about the book, not because of a dramatic conclusion (NOT!), but because you can finally put this dreadful book down.<br /><br />Bottom line - save your money and buy something like a W.E.B.

B000025OG6|5.0|Rather than holding onto the over-the-top synthesized glossiness of the eighties, Toto decided to take a much more raw bluesy approach on KOD.  Steve Lukather lends his slightly raspy vocals to these uptempo rockers.  The band sounds and feels more like a band on this album than on any other before.<br /><br />Sadly, drummger Jeff Porcaro died shortly after the recording and just before the release of this gem, prompting Toto to take their music in yet another new direction.  One can only wonder where Toto would be today had they continued down this musical path.

The CD is full of variation and interesting jams that will keep you wanting more of this band!   <br />The Mars Volta is also a band that does there own thing.  They do not let the record company come between there music and play great music.  I highly recommend this album!  Give it a try!! <br /> <br />Evolta320
0062502182|1.0|A fast read because it contained almost nothing worth thinking about and the writing was boring.  It ignores reality, complexity, and responsibility and dwells on a happy-go-lucky idiot savant who definitely does NOT illustrate any Christian principles.  Or any other religious principles I know of.  If you want a good tale of philosphy from Andalucia, try Miguel de Unamuno.
0385510454|3.0|If you've never been to Bologna, this travelogue is a must.It not only covers the do's and donts of Italian ettiquette (never drink cappucino after 10:30 in the morning, gentlemen dont wear denim, pasta is a course that precedes the entree, not an entree in and of itself), it also is a marvelous guide to the best eating extablishments in Bologna.  Not only does it give addresses of these culinary establishments, we also get menus and even meal suggestions.  The cultural, academic and architectural history of this ancient town is covered as well, and the development of the portico sidewalks that are the hallmark of this deligntful city is explained with grace and aplomb.  <br /> <br />The history of the cathedral is fascinating. Turns out it was initially planned as a civic monument deliberately designed to be larger than St. Peter's Basilica in Rome.  It took the intervention of the Pope to put a stop to this. <br /> <br />Sometimes the author goes a bit overboard stating the obvious, going on a bit too much like an innocent abroad, what with discomfort over the smaller public areas and cars which are ofund in Europe as well as the fact that indoor smoking is still allowed in most places.  The worst offense is the observation that there are still real live commnists teaching at the University.  He also spends way too much time informing us how to use internet cafes and how to use blue tooth cellphones to e mail loved ones back in the states. <br /> <br />This weakness is more than made up for by the Italian lesson that goes on throughout the book.  Even the most casual reader of The Broker will develop a decent enough grasp of the language to ask directions, buy food and drink, book a hotel, arrange transportation, and even seduce a soon to be widowed tutor. <br /> <br />Oh, and then there is the plot.  If you like Grisham, you'll like (and recognize) the story, and if you hate him, skip the book, cause its the same ole same ole.  As ever, your've got FBI, CIA, assassins from everywhere, chasing out hero, and the five or six twists that manage to keep the pages turning.  Without giving away the ending, I really need to know why Grisham always ends his books with secret numbered bank accounts.
B00063F8B2|4.0|If you loved the movie, then here is the soundtrack that runs for 46 minutes including a 6 minute long song with just music played. On this cd has some new Christmas songs and older Christmas songs perfomed by Frank Sinatra, The Andrews Sisters, Bing Crosby, which includes some of the singers performing together on a couple of the songs, and then we have some orginal songs through in sung by Tom Hanks, Steven Tyler, Josh Groban, and a duet between Matthew Hall and Meagan Moore. The teack numbers are<br /><br />1. The Polar Express -- Tom Hanks<br /><br />2. When Christmas Comes To Town -- Matthew Hall and Meagan Moore<br /><br />3. Rockin' On Top of the World -- Steven Tyler<br /><br />4. Believe -- Josh Groban<br /><br />5. Hot Chocolate -- Tom Hanks<br /><br />6. Spirit of the Season -- Alan Silvestri<br /><br />7. Seeing is Believing -- Alan Silvestri<br /><br />8. Santa Claus is Comin' To Town -- Frank Sinatra<br /><br />9. White Christmas -- Bing Crosby<br /><br />10. Winter Wonderland -- The Andrews Sisters<br /><br />11. It's Beginning to Look Like Christmas -- Perry Como<br /><br />12. Silver Bells -- Kate Smith<br /><br />13. Here Comes Santa Claus (Right Down Claus Lane) -- Bing Crosby and The Andrews Sisters<br /><br />14. Suite From the Polar Express -- Alan Silvestri<br /><br />If you love any of these songs, singers, or this movie, you might even want to think about adding this soundtrack to your collection. But it is nice to hear some new Christmas songs on this cd like When Christmas Comes to Town. Now you might be surpised to see that Tom Hanks is lisited as a singer on here, and he does it without the usual when actors aren't known for singing, or can't sing, then most of the time somebody is paid to come in a do the singing voice of a character no matter whether the film is live action or animation.
B0006SNL2K|1.0|Slipknot rule, there's no doubt about it but this album they put out just plain sucks. I am a die hard Slipknot fan and gave this cd many chances and I get more disappoinent everytime I hear it. It's garbage. Not impressed. We all know that they can produce much, much better music than this. If you like soft music such as Dave Matthews, than this cd is for the easy listening.
B00009XITQ|4.0|Orginally I thought the movie looked like another pre-teen flick made with the star vehicle being another popular child entainer but, this movie is so much more than that. O.K so the plot maybe, a little predictable but, I still enjoyed watching this one with my cousins on family movie night. I certainly enjoyed watching more than Mary-Kate and Ashley or Hillary Duff!<br /><br />I felt as though the characters seemed witty and had somewhat of a smart dialouge... but, really captured this movie were the actors who did a phenumal job of keeping your interested. There was not one person who was badly cast in this film. Although I still maintain the belief that Amanda Bynes is more of entainer than an actress. I watch it over and over again admiring Colin Firth's role as dad to Daphne!<br /><br />This movie was great and if you have a pre-teen to tween daughter they'll love you if you buy this film!
B000002AH7|5.0|At a party in the mid 1960s I did that thing that most people did at the time - flip through the cardboard box of records sitting beside the little suitcase record player. The woman giving the party was not into quality turntables and 500lb speakers. <br />  Through most of the stack I found nothing in common with my own record collection, no flamenco, no swing, no Olatungi, no Lenny Bruce. Lots of strange folk stuff with titles like \\"Mountain Music of Kentucky\\" and current albums EVERYONE I knew had (Beatles, Dylan, etc). No jazz - just like my own collection.  <br />   Then I found \\"Sketches of Spain\\" one of two jazz records I did own. I didn't think about it much at the time but a few years later when we got married I found out that this and my other jazz album \\"Time Out\\" were the only records we both owned. Over the decades our musical tastes have grown much closer (We just got a new two CD set of \\"Mountain Music of Kentucky\\") and we both have developed a taste for jazz, but are both still very much into \\"Sketches\\" and would never be without it. <br />   It's that kind of album - Yeah I have \\"Kind of Blue\\" too, but this is still my idea of what Miles Davis was all about. I think I bought my first copy in 1959 or 60. This is music for life.
B00028HBKM|4.0|Their is a new phrase \\"pulling a passion\\" afterall the controversy that surrounds this movie-- the belief that it was anti-semtic created a hit-- for we all wanted to see what the real media fuss was about. I bought the DVD before actually seeing the movie and I do not regret that decision.<br /><br />With all the blood and gore I kind of regret that I watched it with my cousins before viewing it myself-- by the end of the first half hour we all were crying... The scenes are so realistic and it is graphic. That you really have to make sure your children are mature enough to see some of them... As a religious person the movie made me really question my faith and my beliefs--It will make you do so too... The acting done is simply breathtaking and you enjoy the movie despite the fact it is Latin.<br /><br />And for all of those out there who think this film is anti-semetic it will create hatred towards Jews-- trust me it won't... for true followers of Christ know it was Christ's destiny to die on the cross-- if it hadn't been the Jews it would of been another group of people who crucified Christ.<br /><br />With beautiful music, a great cast, breath-taking scenry, and great acting the passion did not go wrong in any sense. The bad part about this movie is really you only have to see it once for it to hit you. And you can it was a life-long passion achievement for Mel Gibson. This is the movie to own in your collection!
0786915749|1.0|I am afraid I fall in the minority in terms of opinion for this book. With its immense popularity, I figured that it had to be good, so I picked up a copy of Dragons of Autumn Twilight hoping to be impressed by some riveting fantasy genius. How very wrong I was. I honestly do not understand how so many of these reviewers can call these books a masterpiece of fantasy. I started reading it and I even tried to like it--I even forced myself to finish it--but I still don't understand why it has a four and a half star rating. At best, it deserves a two and a half or a three.<br /><br />First, the characters. The story revolves around a group of heroes (each one as original as cardboard). Again, I tried to like this book, so I tried to like at least a few of the characters, but at this I failed utterly. I was intrigued by Raistlin, the mysterious young mage, and even liked him for a while, but throughout the book he became more annoying and less intriguing. And what of the character development? There was none that I could really see. Underwhelming.<br /><br />Second, the plot. What plot? I found out after reading the book that Dragonlance was based on fantasy gaming and that the book was somewhat based on gaming scenarios. Anyhow, it does not work to come together to create a plotline of a decent fantasy book. If I had known that Dragonlance was based on gaming, I would have avoided it.<br /><br />Third, the writing. The writing quailty reminded me of the style of my own writing when I attempted to write fantasy at age twelve. I was actually a pretty decent writer at that age, but very amatuerish. And this book sounds amateurish, nothing of the accomplished writers that I have become spoiled to in fantasy. The narrative is for the most part more aloof, but sometimes delves into a character's inner thoughts. When it does so, it is in a slippery, unorganized fashion that made me cringe.  The story felt manufactured, not written.<br /><br />By the way, there were some technical errors that also made me cringe. The most prominent was the repeated use of 'thee is' and other grating grammatical errors in archaic English by the centaurs. It is THOU ART dammit! This is what really turned me off from the book, even after all my efforts to try and like it. GGRRRR! Just thinking about this book makes me angry. The only book that I have read that is worse is Crossroads of Twilight, book 10 of Wheel of Time. But that book got a more appropriate rating at one and a half stars.<br /><br />I think an inherant problem with the bloated rating is that many of the people writing the reviews have read this book as an introduction to the fantasy genre, so they do not have anything to base this book against. I mean no offense, but only to say that they may be underread in fantasy. Or maybe I just have really high standards for what I read. Well, if you have high standards too, then you might want to check out A Song of Ice and Fire by George RR Martin, The Farseer Trilogy by Robin Hobb, Memory, Sorrow and Thorn by Tad Williams, or for anyone who thinks that this is better than Tolkien, The Lord of the Rings, the true masterpiece of fantasy.<br /><br />If you are in fifth of sixth grade, ignore everything I just said and by all means read it. You will be in for a pleasant adventure. If you are any older and want to read something of substance, read something else.inge.

B0000VAFO0|5.0|The film brings to the screen the story of a centuries old blood feud between vampires and werewolves (Lycans).  Things get more complicated when a human doctor is caught up in the conflict, as he becomes the means for creating a vampire-werewolf hybrid, something that could tip the balance between the combatants.  <br />Underworld is a highly entertaining, action packed adventure/thriller with significant elements of horror.  <br />Kate Beckinsale (who is GORGEOUS!!!), Bill Nighy, and the rest of the cast have truly outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least.  All the actors, without exceptions, give it their 100% and it really shows (the chemistry is AMAZING)!   <br />The plot, the setting, the special effects, the MUSIC, and the swordfights are all EXCELLENT!  Underworld is a movie guaranteed to provide an evening's entertainment and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection! <br />In conclusion, the film establishes a GREAT cliffhanger for a sequel, which I would definitely line up to watch! <br />
6305313687|5.0|Edward Norton's performance in this film is nothing short of brilliant.<br /><br />Let me be clear. I don't agree with racist propaganda. I'm speaking about the man's performance.<br /><br />This film openly shows viewers how one can become a racist and more important, be consumed by it inexhaustive fire. The death of Derek's father seems to be the catalyst for his seduction by Stacy Keach.<br /><br />Hate is truely blinding it seems because once Derek gives into his hate, he becomes compassionless, and void of human feelings, making him capable of committing murder and feeling good about it.<br /><br />Fortunately though, he meets his enemy (the black man) face to face in prison and actually has many conversations with him.<br /><br />Derek learns a lot about the man and himself. He also learns that his allegiance to the \\"brotherhood\\" is a bona fide sham.<br /><br />But does this discovery change his mind?<br /><br />Also, my man Avery Brooks of Spenser for Hire and Star Trek: Deep Space Nine offers a compelling performance too. It's a shame he hasn't been seen in more films.<br /><br />Brilliant stuff here folks. Check it out!
B00000K0E5|5.0|With Sean Bean in the role of 006, Brosnan has tough competition as an actor and as eye-candy.  Bond definately meets his match in 006, physically and strategically, adding tension and suspense to the many great action scenes.  Action aside, I think Bond has three women in this film, so it's none to short of his usual sexual flamboyancy.  Goldeneye remains my favorite of all the Bond films.  If I could only own one, this would be it.  Enjoy!
B00030590I|1.0|I'm a huge Jet Li Fan and this film was incredibly disappointing.<br /><br />Enough said.<br /><br />Sorry Jet.
B000670DQI|4.0|The reason to re-purchase this disc is the sound on the DVD 5.1 channel side. It is sublime, superb, superior to the already high standards Bowie established with the original release. There are format wars brewing with HDDVD and Blue-ray formats arriving at the end of 2005, but likely they will be a pricey notch up as the studios re-tread their releases. For the moment, and for my money, the sound on this disc is superior to the sound on the SACD release. There is both depth and warmth to the disc, and the separation is terrific. There is, as well, a film. Very arty stuff, but that goes with Bowie. All in all, I would hope that there will be more, especially from artists who actually care what their discs sound like. I'd love to hear a DVD Audio or a dual-disc DVD sound of The Band's THE BAND, or Van Morrison's AVALON SUNSET, or near anything from Gabriel, Knopfler and the Blue Nile, so hopefully there is impetus on the horizon before we all have to re-buy our favourites in what will be the next format war. Get this one, though, as you'll love every second of music here in.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|I loved this film.<br /><br />Tom Cruise was bad to the bone. Jamie Foxx was brilliant and incredibly believable.<br /><br />You've gotta see this one.<br /><br />Plus Jada Pinkett Smith was looking seriously good too. Something for everyone. LOL!
B00067189O|5.0|On what is likely the disc that Wynton Marsalis will have to realize he will never be up to, the 5.1 channel sound has accomplished the impossible of making a perfect recording sound ever more perfect, more intimate, more of the moment. This is the jazz CD you are not allowed to die before listening to. So much has been written that it's positively stupid for me to extol its virtues any further. Instead, let me just encourage you to pick up this edition, set it into your very best 5.1 sound system, close your eyes. This music is right there all around you and for a disc that always sounded so incredibly essential, that has just taken on an entirely new meaning. I like this far more than the SACD version, and I hope Columbia and the Davis estate will consider giving this treatment to his entire ouevre. That should finally send Wynton and his Coca-cola glissandos off the Chrysler building for ever. This is the disc that all of us point to when Troupe, Wynnie and the entire retro-jazz clique say they don't get it: well, it was never about the notes, lads, it was about the silence between them. You'll hear that as never before on this version.
B00000JLWW|5.0|This Oscar winner was nearly flawless! However, the motion picture academy left out the one character that made the storyline work--the fiancee, brought to life by Billy Zane. Without Zane's realistic, crazy antics to kill the young lovers, Dicaprio and Winslet, the film doesn't work.<br /><br />Let's face it, we all knew the ship was going to sink, right? Frankly, the only reason I paid good money to see the film in theaters (saw it 4 times plus dvd viewing) is because I have the utmost respect for director James Cameron, who brought us True Lies, Aliens, and The Terminator.<br /><br />His reputation alone was good enough for me to pay my hard earn dollars to see what this film was about.<br /><br />So, when viewing this dvd, see if I'm correct in my assessment of Billy Zane's performance. Shoot me an email afterward. KeithLeeJohnson1@aol.com
B0006GAOBI|4.0|Watching this version made me realize what made the orignal so good: the subtelty, the things left to the imagination.   <br />However, I find it hard to really compare it to the original. I think its best to look at these two versions as seperate movies best for different audiences, the director's cut more suitable for mainstream American audiences and the original for people that like what mainstream Americans call \\"weird\\" movies. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the original movie, then you might think these are bad things... <br />   - like another reviewer points out, most of the subtelty is gone.  Things are brought up and made apparent in the director's cut.  The ambiguity made the film more powerful, for me.  This is why Hitchcock films were great.  This is why the chainsaw scene in Scarface was scary without actually seeing the action.  The viewer's mind is much more powerful than anything on the screen could ever be.  This might be a matter of opinion or one's taste though. <br /> <br />   - The addition of sound design is way to apparent.  Too much birds chirping, classroom noises, background chatter, etc.  This is especially bad in the first 40 minutes of the film.  It makes the film seem less real.  That stuff isn't supposed to take attention away from a film, and it does in this version.  This is probably the only really bad thing about the movie. <br /> <br />   - It would have been nice to have the choice of watching the original version OR the director's cut on the same disc.  That way people new to the film can see the differences. Nobody really wants to buy a movie twice. <br /> <br />If you liked the original version, you will probably appreciate the things that are revealed in the director's cut as new insights.  The time travel stuff is explained a bit more.  Whether thats good or bad is arguable.  I think that is the main aspect that makes it seem like another movie.  In the original it was more mysterious so you just looked at it like something you can't know anyway so you focused more on how this phenomenom effected the characters, rather trying to understand the phenomenom itself. <br /> <br />There is dialogue about Donnie being agnostic that I think was better left out.  Now there's going to be a million teenagers suddenly becoming agnostic because its cool.  In my opinion this isn't even really important to the story and seems like a distracting attempt to add depth to Donnie's state of mind. <br /> <br />Overall I think the differences make the director's cut a different movie altogether. Its not a better movie or a worse movie, just a different take on the story.  Now you have a movie about time travel itself, parallel universes meeting, a teenager's contemplation about god and dealing with the average troubles of being a teenager.  In the original all these things were presented vaguely enough that you were left to consider the characters and their interaction with each other more than the actual stuff they are going through.   <br /> <br />If you already have the original, you might as well get the director's cut for the simple reason that you get a new way of looking at the story. <br /> <br />If you have never seen either version, I highly suggest both though I prefer the original because its a bit darker and \\"weirder\\".  If you don't like \\"weird\\" movies, then check out the director's cut.
B00003CXWV|4.0|As I watched this film, it occured to me that George Jung was a really smart guy, but made stupid decisions over and over again.<br /><br />But, it's a good thing he and most other criminals do; otherwise, how would the cops ever catch them?<br /><br />In Blow, we learn the mindset of a young person who wants everything handed to him. Jung decides to take the \\"easy way\\" to riches and it worked for a very brief, fleeting moment.<br /><br />He had it all. A nice looking babe, cars, mansion, and money. Trouble is he got it all illegally and there's no way you can get away with that kind of life style very long before the Cops come and kick in your door; especially if you're snorting your own product.<br /><br />Like I said, let's be grateful Mr. Jung wasn't more careful. If he were, America's drug problem might be even worse than what it is now.<br /><br />Watch this one and see where a life of drugs and drug dealing leads.
B0006GAI6Y|4.0|I couldn't help myself comparing this movie to Strictly Ballroom, a much more entertaining and memorable ballroom dancing movie I saw way back in the '90s. This movie is funnier, but it it's dancing scenes are less stimulating, and J.Lo had very little chemistry with Richard Gere. It's not like they didn't try their best, it's just that the story is too ordinary that they did't connect well. It still featured a fine cast with some graceful performances to make it a decent comedy.<br /><br />Gere played John Clark, and he's bored to death of his job and mundane life. He has a wonderful and loving wife and  teenage daughter and son, but he has lost his passion for life. In order to revive himself, he started to secretly take ballroom dancing lessons at a school for amateurs, and there he met Paulina/J.Lo, a  professional ballroom dancer who lost a competition a year earlier, and ended up taking part as an instructor. Clark's collegue Link/Stanley Tucci was also there for the lessons, and he's more serious, and he wears a wig whenever he dances. Meanwhile, Sarandon suspects her husband might be having an affair,and hires a spy to check him out. Paulina and Clark became friends and she revealed to him her true passion and goal for dancing. Clark was given some serious lessons from her and would eventually go for an amateur competition. Things got rather chaotic when his wife and daughter showed up as audiences to witness him danced marvellously.<br /><br />Richard Gere is impressive with his dramatic and comedy moments, but his dancing scenes is no comparison to J.Lo. Susan Sarandon had some chemistry with Gere, and she managed to delivered a touching performance. Stanley Tucci is funny as usual, especially when another rival dancer pulled his wig off. J.Lo is underused in this film, and she's quite striking and stands on her own during any given dance scenes, because she was a dancer long before she became a singer and actress. Other characters served mostly as comic relief. Overall, if you expect some stunning ballroom dancing numbers, this is the wrong place for it, because this movie is not just about dancing, it's more about the impact dancing has on the lives of ordinary people.rall, if you expect some stunning ballroom dancing numbers, this is the wrong place for it, because this movie is not just about dancing, it's more about the impact dancing has on the lives of ordinary people.
B00049QQHI|4.0|I had no idea what this film was about when I picked it up at block buster the other day. It was free for gold members, which I happen to be. Dicaprio and Ernie Hudson were in so I said, why not.<br /><br />I started watching the film and I thought, oh, this is a kids movie. The next thing I knew, Dicaprio was snorting cocaine with a hot chick who promised him the coke would make him superman in bed.<br /><br />And that's when the film grabbed me because I knew then that the kid was going to end up hooked. The film then depicts just how this happened to a promising young basketball player, who made way to many bad decisions in his formative years.<br /><br />Check this one out.

B00062IVKS|5.0|Dear Mr. DeNiro,    I was in awe the first time I watched this movie, 25 years ago. I thought at the time you were cinematic perfection as an actor.    Recently, I bought this special anniversary edition and my opinion is the same. You are awesome, sir.    This DVD was issued with total care. The sound track was upgraded to today's standards of excellence. The comments from Mr. Scorsese and others, notably Mr. La Motta, were intelligent and very interesting. The final result of this edition is flawless.    Your acting made me all emotional, Mr. DeNiro. At times I had tears streaming down my face, other times I was laughing, then emotional again, and so on. Your performance covered such a variety of human emotions that it is impossible to describe. We do not attempt to describe perfection, do we?    What else can I add? Well, I believe your performance was an inspiration for all the people involved in this project. The result? A movie that will remain the best in its genre, frozen in time, way up there among the great ones.    Thank you, sir. You will remain unforgettable.
B00005JMXX|4.0|This is a spectacular action film, with only half a brain. <br />There's just too many dumb lines in it. Or dumb plot twists. Or dumb explanations. <br /> <br />WHO CARES! <br /> <br />This isn't nearly as dumb as \\"The Towering Inferno\\", and wasn't that nominated for an Academy Award? <br /> <br />What you have here is a stereotypical classic disaster picture, with a primary cast of about 12, three or four intertwining plot lines of dubious importance or logic, and some of the most spectacular, awe-inspiring visions of disaster yet put on film. The cast includes Dennis Quaid, Jake Gyllenhal, Sela Ward, Emmy Rossum and a host of recognizable character actors. <br /> <br />OK. Go with me here for a second. Not only does the island of Manhattan flood, it does so to a height where an oil tanker can float in front of the Public Library. <br />And then the whole island freezes! With the tanker right there! <br /> <br />If your eyes rolled, then this movie ain't for you. <br />No way no how. <br />Yet, if some inner child in you thought briefly, \\"Coooool\\" then I think you're in for a treat. The hailstorms, floods, hurricanes...the tornados destroying L.A...ice storms galore...come on now, this is great stuff. Just imagine that not long ago, this would have a miniature cardboard set with a tank of water dropped on it. Now we see the water rising through the manhole covers, the icicles on the Statue of Liberty...the Hollywood sign acting like Dorothy's house in the \\"Wizard of Oz\\"... <br /> <br />...maybe this seemed better as it's torrentially raining in L.A. right now... <br /> <br />My 13-year old nephew thought this movie totally rocked, if that's of any help. <br /> <br />If you love disaster movies in general, this is SO up your alley. You have no idea! <br />If you prefer small indie films, run. Run fast.
B00000IN5G|3.0|First off, I don't know who labled this band Black Metal, because I hear non of that in this. They fit into the MElo-Death category. They are kind of like In FLames, but rely on the keyboards instead of the guitars. The guitars are great, but the keyboards are nagging, and overshadow them. The timings of the songs are pretty good. But the worst part of all is the lyrics- \\"Silent night, Bodom Night\\"? Pretty dumb. They could probably have better lyrics for being a band named after a couple of murdered kids.

Catherine wants Bobby to help her, but he is not so sure that she is not guilty of setting the stage for her husband's death. <br /> <br />Lisa Gardner is skilled at portraying her characters in a realistic fashion. They have their faults and their strengths. The story was well plotted, but for some reason, I was not engaged, as I should have been. I'm not sure why.  For me, it was a good story, but not exactly a page-turner.  <br />
B00001OH7O|5.0|Nothing but a masterpiece.  <br />It's hard to decide which Bowie album is the best, this one or Ziggy Stardust. But I think Hunky Dory edges it...just.  <br />From Changes to the Bewerley Twins, each track, from song to song is a classic. A must have for all music fans. <br /> <br /> <br />
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Tracks 4, 5, 8-11 are perfect in my opinion.  The rest are just great!!!  I know I don't regret this CD at all.  I can't describe how captivating, the lead vocal Matthew sounds with piano.
B0006B29Z2|4.0|Having been a fan of Maiden through most of the '80's, but giving up on them after Fear of the Dark, I found this DVD set quite good, since it ends at the end of their Piece of Mind tour.<br />While I feel that the addition of Bruce Dickinson to the line-up back in '82 enabled the band's songwriting to move into more progressive and interesting directions, I have always liked the Paul Di'anno period for it's raw and more intense peformances. Getting a chance to see footage with Di'anno (particularly as I wasn't old enough to see the band with him back in the day) is great. I think Di'anno and Dickinson, while both very different, are very good vocalists for the metal genre.<br />Some minor complaints are that there is a lot of song repetition (but it's not as bad as some have made it sound) and the Ruskin Arms footage is really raw (and bad!). The Live at the Rainbow suffers from a lot of band insert shots from other parts of the song from what you are hearing, which as a guitar player I find extremely annoying. I'm glad that this practice has pretty much stopped for live footage over the years. The Beast over Hammersmith video is dark and murky, but that is explained in the liner notes and is part of the reason it was never released until now. It's cool that they do Total Eclipse (one of my favourties). The German TV appearance is the best sounding and looking part of the set, only slightly ruined by Dickinson sounding strained as he sings (a common problem from him in the '80's).<br />The bonus material is fun. The documentary is good, and horrors (!), the 20th Century Box documentary that I first saw when I was 11 is included. Seeing this again reminded me of why I was first interested in Maiden (they sound particularly intense here), but the interview with the 'pro' air guitarist is painful to watch. I hope he eventually got a girlfriend, although I seriously doubt it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have seen the movie 4 times and loved it a little more each time. I think the acting and singing is superb, and that the characters are portrayed with such feeling and passion. The Phantom (Gerard Butler) was in my personal opinion a wonderful choice as he is a multi-talented actor. Emmy Rossum and the rest of the cast are equally delightful and just as talented. I feel this movie has recieved a lot of criticism that is unfounded to say the least because this really is a very good movie
B00005B36H|5.0|Ignore the fact that Tool are an incredible group who have constantly made cutting-edge music, ignore any hype or lack thereof surrounding their music. I owned Lateralus for four years before I actually \\"got it.\\" I now know this is quite possibly the most important record ever made. Lie back, crank up the volume, and immerse yourself in the music. Now pay close attention to ALL of the lyrics. You will know you're understanding the message if you start to feel like you might be dying. Do not break the spell, let yourself die if neccessary. If you survive, you will have the \\"meaning of life\\" and be reborn as a better human being. This is the only album you will ever need because it gives you the answers straight up. End of story. Dont be an idiot, Tool are what they claim to be: a tool used to help bring meaning to your life. You just have to put a little thought into it.
1400034779|5.0|The Republic of Botswana is located in Southern Africa, nestled between South Africa, Namibia, Zimbabwe and Zambia. The largest exporter of gemstone diamonds in the world, Botswana is democratically ruled and has some of Africa's last great wildernesses including the famous Okavango Swamps and the Kalahari desert. The country's latest claim to fame is \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" whose owner, and our protagonist, Precious Ramotswe, is its only female detective - perhaps the only one in all of Africa - thus the agency's name.<br /><br />The delightfully cunning Mma. Ramotswe inherited a herd of cattle from her beloved father. She then sold the cattle and used the money to start her agency in Gaborone. Uncertain of her success as a female entrepreneurial sleuth, she was met with skepticism from all sides. \\"Can women be detectives?\\" asked the bank's lawyer. Her only capital assets are a tiny white van, two desks, two chairs, a telephone, an old typewriter, a teapot, and three teacups. Oh! And she owns the sign outside her office, which reads, \\"THE NO. 1 LADIES DETECTIVE AGENCY. FOR ALL CONFIDENTIAL MATTERS AND ENQUIRIES. SATISFACTION GUARANTEED FOR ALL PARTIES. UNDER PERSONAL MANAGEMENT.\\"<br /><br />Precious Ramotswe, however, does have the \\"Right Stuff.\\" Her most valuable assets are intangible, but I'd take them to the bank any day. She is extremely intelligent, with outstanding intuitive capabilities (that sounds professional!). Possessing a keen perception of the human character, along with perseverance, and a strong set of values, she inspires trust in most all who meet her. She is also good woman with a kind heart. Most inspiring is her deep and abiding love for Africa, and for Botswana and its people in particular. \\"They are my people, my brothers and sisters. It is my duty to help them to solve the mysteries of their lives. That is what I am called to do.\\"<br /><br />This is not an ordinary crime novel/police procedural. Nor is it an edge-of-your-seat mystery thriller. Yes, Mma. Ramotswe is a private detective, but she manages to solve mysteries without the use of guns and violence, for the most part, preferring to use unorthodox solutions instead. Her cases may be small but they deal with issues important to people's lives, and some of them are extremely thought-provoking and emotional. A sinister event comes to her attention when a young boy goes missing. Mma. Romotswe will have to confront one of her country's most fearful traditions - the use of human bones to make powerful medicine.<br /><br />The narrative is written simply, in a clear, uncluttered style. And our Number One Detective is a pure delight, as are the people she deals with, and their everyday problems which she helps them resolve. The details of Mma. Ramotswe's background, her life before she began detecting, are intense and absorbing. The novel is enchanting and I am captivated by Precious Ramotswe. \\"The No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" received two Booker Judges' Special Recommendations and was voted one of the International Books of the Year and the Millennium by the Times Literary Supplement. This is the first book in a series.<br /><br />JANAr-seat mystery thriller. Yes, Mma.

0385512104|5.0|I had heard a lot of good things about the book The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time by Mark Haddon.  After waiting for some time for it to come in at the library, I finally got the chance to read it.  It's definitely different and will make you adjust your reality...<br /><br />Christopher Boone is an autistic child who lives with his father in a small town in England.  When the neighbor's dog is found killed, Boone decides that he should do some investigating to figure out who might have done the killing.  But during his investigation, he finds out some facts about his mother and her relationship with his father that force him to re-evaluate what he feels and how he relates to the most familiar people in his life.<br /><br />This book is unique in many ways.  The story is written in first person form by the main character, Christopher Boone.  Since he's autistic and unable to understand human emotions, you are forced to see normal human transactions from a point of view that is outside of your normal experience.  Add in obsessive/compulsive behavior, and you start to understand how hard it would be to live with someone in this situation.  Reviews from people who have close experiences with that condition say that the writing is very realistic for what they experience on a daily basis.  It's also easy to see how raising an autistic child could put a major strain on a marriage.  I wouldn't want to have to manage that...<br /><br />Very good book...  Funny, sad, thought-provoking...  Highly recommended...
B0001ADAVK|2.0|Considering the subject matter and the feminist overtones, I expected much more from this movie what was delivered. Save for one brilliant (if somewhat awkwardly-placed) scene involving Julia Roberts' passionate admonishment of the internalized sexism of popular advertising, this movie is rife with cliches and over-trodden ground. There are times when you feel as if the film is trying to say something more about sex roles, feminism, and the advent of what would later be coined as \\"the feminine mystique,\\" but they appear so infrequently, so awkwardly, and so unsatisfying as to barely merit a mention. <br /> <br />In terms of acting, Julia Roberts' and Maggie Gyllenhaal's roles are the most successfully portrayed. Kirsten Dunst succeeds at being annoying (for once her intent matches her performance) and Julia Stiles' role was just awfully acted altogether, no two ways about it. I've never heard a more unconvincing and \\"I'm happy!\\" in my life. Her heart-to-heart with Roberts, regardless of how important the message, almost brought tears to my eyes -- not out of any strong feeling, but because it was so painfully artificial.  <br /> <br />If taken at little more than face value, the movie warrants a viewing, if only for the beautiful cinematography and snapshot of female collegiate life post-World War 2. But if you are a historian or a feminist (or both) hoping to enjoy a glimpse into the world that inspired Fridan's classic expose, look elsewhere. And if you ever find one that satisfies this desire, be sure to let me know.
B0001I55OC|2.0|Very bad screen adaption of a book!! <br /> <br />The book kept the reader riveted and enthralled.  This movie just has some fun explosions and battle scenes but gets completely lost during the one and a half hours on the screen. <br /> <br />I won't even discuss this movie in detail, it's not worth it.  If you want sincere enjoyment, buy the book online.  A new copy from an Amazon affiliate bookseller starts at $1.59 (not a bad investment).   <br /> <br />Pity though, the book was fantastic... <br />
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I have to agree with 99.9% of the reviews I have read on here.  I have seen the movie 4 times now (and plan on more if they don't take it from the theatres here any time soon).  The first time I saw it was around Christmas and I took my 19 year old son.  He was surprised to have enjoyed it so much and I had to buy two copies of the deluxe cd version so I could send him one *grin*.  Now he listens to it as much as he can.  I also listen to it often and feel myself swept away into a different world, remembering what was going on on the screen as I listen to each song. <br /> <br />I rarely go to the movies because of the cost.  I figure if I want to see a movie I'll wait till it comes out on dvd and either rent or buy.  But with Phantom, I have to keep going back, no matter how much the tickets cost.  The movie brings out just about every emotion humans go through.   <br /> <br />I have read much criticism about Butler's Phantom, but I think these people have gone into this closed minded.  I have not seen others in the role (though I've heard some of Michael Crawford's singing), but I believe Butler's rendition of the Phantom was amazing.  The pain, the anger, the passion, the love, to name but a few emotions.  I could see all of that in his eyes, in the way he moved, in the sound of his voice.  I, like many, fell in love with Phantom.  Even with his dark side, even with him being a killer. <br /> <br />I can't believe how badly the critics treated this movie, or the award ceremonies.  One sometimes (maybe most of the time) has to wonder if some of these people actually watch these things with an open mind.  But, I have learned from past experience, to never let what a critic says be the deciding factor on if I see something. <br /> <br />I just know that I will be owning this DVD and will probably wear it out.  I may never see the stage play (doesn't come to my little city) and I'm not interested in other film versions that appear to make the Phantom more of a horrorstory, but with only this movie I have become a big Phantom fan.  I will buy any DVD version they put out, expecting anniversary editions and who knows what else down the road. <br /> <br />It will not be the same as seeing it in the movie, unless you have a big screen tv with surround sound, but get the DVD so you can always give in to your desire and passion for Music of the Night.  And if you haven't seen it in the theatre, do so now if it's still playing where you are, you won't be disappointed.
0061015725|5.0|One of the best Crichton books yet! <br /> <br />Absolutely no complaints at all! Suspensefull, riveting and original plot.  The writing was so vivid, that as I turned each and every page I couldn't help but visualise the story in my mind. Like all his books, the underlying supportive facts and attention to detail immerse the reader so intently that he can't help but believe that he is part of a real life experience. <br /> <br />If you Like a little science fiction coupled with todays' cutting edge nano-technological advances, with a lot of mystery and a little drama, this book is for you!! <br /> <br />A guaranteed movie blockbuster if it goes to the cinema!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|Jay should have waited another year to release Kanye, since he demolished his farewell album with College Dropout. As the one reviewer said--a talented artist from the Roc? No, I couldn't believe it, either. <br /> <br />Adding a soulful, catchy beat and yet keeping introspective, conscious rhymes, Kanye came out strong with his debut. It is not only an album that will keep you listening--and, I might add, laughing or nodding your head--from beginning to end, it will keep you thinking while constantly in awe of the well-crafted, witty lines. Truly an album to keep one entertained. <br /> <br />As for the complaints from the \\"real\\" rap listeners--yes, Kanye has addictive beats; yes, Kanye raps primarily about education and politics; yes, Kanye grew up in the 'burbs; so no, he does not keep to the stereotypical topics of \\"money, hoes and bank rolls\\" (courtesy of Nas from Illmatic--yes, I know the music). He has mainstream appeal, so therefore he's naturally going to take flak from the underground rap community. He's taken rap further than the trite crap you hear from some commonplace rapper on BET. If you want to complain about mainstream, meaningless music, target his boss Jay-Z. Kanye, on the other hand, has added a new sound to the genre that will hopefully pull it from the seemingly hopeless rut that it has fallen into, with few other stars left shinning out amongst the muck (honorable mentions: Nas, Talib Kweli, Mos Def). <br /> <br />In conclusion, College Dropout surpasses its hype. Kanye released a memorable album that will remain one of my favorites of all time. A definite good buy.
B0000026DJ|5.0|Whilst not always agreeing with the messages in Midnight Oil's songs I do love the music. Few can disagree that this band has talent that is raw, wonderfully smooth and refreshing from this Australian long time band that has just recently separated after a marathon time together. This album shows the rich culture and attitude of MO and 'Deisel and Dust' is the best that Australiana has to offer.<br /><br />This CD has messages in each of the song from the plea to return land to the dispossessed native inhabitance of Australia to a celebration of the rich coastal and inland culture of the Australian landscape and culture. Looking at reviews it is nice to see that many Americans have taken to this band and makes me proud in some ways to witness a band like MO have such an impact on other people's from across the oceans.<br /><br />This is a deserved album of all praise it has recieved. MO effort in validating their stamp on the Australian music scene for some generations to come is apparent. Listen and heed the message of Peter Garrett and those rascals from Down Under!
B000002AZ8|4.0|This being Pearl Jam's 3rd release the band re-imaged themselves and moved down the rock'n'roll path that would gain them many more fans that they had already. This album also marked the end of the crossroads for the band. 'Last Kiss' was a strong opener for the band and had me tapping to the rythm. 'Tremor Christ' and 'Corduroy' were also great songs and the latter became a hit with fans and also got alot of radio time.<br /><br />But the best song of this album has to go to 'Immortality' that I think touched on Eddie Vedder's feelings towards Cobain's suicide. It is a great song lyrically and to hear the raw emotion in the song.<br /><br />The last song is the reason this album was not given 5 stars, I was scratching my scalp trying to understand and come to terms with 'That's Me'. This song, if it could be classified as a song, was way strange and experimental. But that's PJ for you, they love to experiment and throw new things in their albums. Good for them. Sometimes it works and others it don't.
B000002UWW|3.0|This CD is quite good in length and delivery. 18 tracks spanning the early years of RHCP's and a few new jingles. This CD is primarily aimed at fans of the early more funky style of the Red Hot Chili Peppers. There were a number of songs I did enjoy listening to and they were 'Higher Ground', 'Behind The Sun', Backwoods', 'Hollywood' and 'Under The Bridge'. These became later RHCP hits.<br /><br />The early grunge punk style of Red Hot Chili Peppers didn't suit my tastes and with age the band turned to more of a rock feel and this ended up being the ticket for the band. All in all this CD has it's qualities and its open for different people's tastes.
B00006M183|3.0|This album is not in the class range of Ten or Binaural but it is still good. This release shows Pearl Jam experimenting with powerful chords and nearly grunge style beats. The Album Art is a tad perplexing and doesn't fit the tone of the music. Then the inside cover you have a scene of the band rehearsing in their studio. Ok....what's the common link here?<br /><br />Can't Keep and Save You are good songs and then the not so good songs come in at Cropduster and Climbing My Way. And I sure didn't understand Green Disease. The highlight of the album for me was the song 1/2 Full and the last song All or None.<br /><br />This album won't suit every Pearl Jam fan but it's still an alright listen.
B000078DOI|3.0|This definitely did not suit my style and this being an early Red Hot Chili Peppers album blended punk, rap and metal together and every song except 'Knock Me Down' sounded like a mish-mash of sounds rather than music. Maybe its because of my leanings toward rock that I feel this way.<br /><br />The Later works of the RHCP's like Californication sounded much better than this.
B000002UAU|5.0|they had included Strawberry Fields Forever/Penny Lane. As it stands it is still arguably the best ever and still routinely tops 'best ever' lists along with Revolver with amazing regularity. But had those two classic been included there would be no argument! Songs cut such as When Im Sixty Four or whatever could have turned up on Mystery Tour or somewhere else though I think that songs music hall kitsche fits the overall sound of pepper perfectly. But anyway still one of the greatest achievments in recorded music and,especially if you like english 60s pop,essential.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This CD is awesome...I wasn't even really a huge Green Day fan, but after buyig this CD I'm absolutely addicted to them... <br />American Idiot- actually not one of the best songs on the album, but still amazing. This song never really gets old to me even though its really overplayed 4/5 <br />Jesus of Sububia- perhaps the best \\"song\\" on the CD, its actually many smaller songs all put into one 9 minute song. Every little section is catchy and will be stuck in your head all day. It's infectious and you'll never get tried of it. 5/5 <br />Holiday- a fairly predicatble song, pretty typical Green Day, but thats why I love it. You'll be humming it for hours 4.3/5 <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams- You've probably heard this song-need I say more? 4/5(used to be 5/5, but I've heard the song about 500 times) <br />Are we the waiting- excellent vocals-the singers voice is so hot! the only downside of this song is that it ends so abruptly and its a bit repetative4.6/5 <br />St. Jimmy- personally my least favorite song, but if your into a bit heavier songs, you'll like this one 3.5/5 <br />Give me novaccaine- great song, excellent lyrics, very catchy, one of the best on the album 4.7/5 <br />She's a rebel- it's alright, nothing that stood out, but again, on another album, this could be considered one of the better songs 3.9/5 <br />Extraordinary girl- weird for me...i kind of like the beginning, but it sounds very elementary compared to the rest of the album, some people will love this one, others won't 4/5 <br />Letterbomb- its a good song, excellent, catchy, addictive 4.2/5 <br />Wake me up when september ends- my FAVORITE..one of my favorite songs of all time..such a good song 6/5 <br />Homecoming- another of the long songs- i prefer jesus of sububia, but this one is also really good-one of the best songs on the album 4.8/5 <br />Whatsername- great way to end the album, didn't like the song at first but it grew on me 4.6/5 <br />All in all, none of the songs will leave you very disappointed. If you are looking for a CD where all of the songs leave you wanting more, this is the one to get....it deserved album of the year, what do those grammy people know anyways??
B00005JNSK|5.0|Tim Burton has taken one of my favourite movies as a kid, (willy wonka)... and added my all-time favourite actor, Johnny Depp...  life IS good.   <br />i thought \\"finding neverland\\" was pretty awesome also... man, anything Depp does is incredible and he picks all my fondest memories and adds the perfect twist of magikal wonder!  \\"fear & loathing\\", another great! (a moment of silence for the great \\"gonzo\\" journalist, Hunter S. Thompson)  wasn't mr. Depp suppose to be featured in another movie of one of Thompson's novels?   <br /> <br />anyway... Gene Wilder's performance of willy wonka, is classic! nothing will ever change that. i believe that Johnny Depp/Tim Burton will make their version a classic of today... not to be compared to the former, both masterpieces in their own.  and i can't wait to see it!!! <br />keep 'em comin' boys! and thanks!
B0006IIPIK|2.0|If you love comic books of the 1930s and movies from the \\"Film Noir\\"-era then Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a must see for you. It is like comic book characters fly off the page at you. It is much like the Flash Gordon flicks of long ago with some snazzy not so special-special effects. What little plot there is comes largely plagiarized out of 1930's science fiction scripts. If you believe that comic books are in-depth reading for you, then the plot and dialogue will be just fine. No matter how much glitter you put on scat...it is still scat. 90+ minutes of my life down the drain.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|It took a while for me to start liking this film. It starts with presenting the setting: a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Greed has caused a global ecological disaster. Only a few places are still fit for humans to live. The Valley of the Wind being one. Even there there are dangers of climate extremes and mutated animals, but it will have to do. Nausicaa's people try to build a new society, one that is in harmony with nature, but they do not know how. Only later in the film do they learn that even they are causing great damage to the environment, and misunderstanding the signs. <br />While Nausicaa's people try to learn from their mistakes, others try to revive the old and dangerous technologies and use them for conquest. Like so many other would-be world conguerors they cloak their ambitions by claiming it is all for the common good. When Nausicaa escapes the invaders she learns the awful truth of her world. Humanity has misunderstood everything again, but this time there is a chance of redemption; that is if she can make anyone listen before it is too late... <br />One thing that is interesting in this film, and in Princess Mononoke also, is the Japanese ambivalent attitude towards authority and duty. If I understand the Japanese attitude correctly you cannot do anything wrong for as long as you honourably do your duty. Since even the conquerors sincerely believe they are acting in the common good they cannot be totally evil. Therefore you do not see this manichean division into good and evil as you see in all Hollywood films. The problems and solutions described in the film become more complex and more interesting.

B000078DOH|1.0|'Freaky Styley' is a apt name for this album release by the Red Hot Chili Peppers. The early songs from this band continues to allude my tastes. I earn for the rock and slight rap of the later albums like By The Way and What Hits.<br /><br />Another CD that wont be played at home.
B000002IHD|5.0|If ever there was an artist that knew how to put everything humanely possible into their musical performance, it was Otis Redding.  Just take one listen to OTIS BLUE and you will know exactly what \\"it\\" is supposed to be all about.  Every track here resonates with vitality and purpose, displaying the prodigious talents that Otis left with us.  Of course there are classics here penned by the man himself (\\"Respect,\\" \\"Ole Man Trouble,\\" and \\"I've Been Loving You Too Long\\"), but of equally impressive measure was Redding's ability to interpret others' compositions (\\"Satisfaction,\\" \\"Rock Me Baby,\\" etc.) with such flare and dynamism, squarely marking them as his own.  Armed with his sensual, yet markedly raw and raspy vocal attack, Redding sounds equally at home performing heart-stirring ballads as he does at stamping out fiercely emphatic upbeat tunes.  While today's \\"soul\\" music seems to be more about seduction, Otis Redding's music was always about personal conviction and unbridled sincerity. If you aren't moved by this music, you might want to check your pulse.  This essential collection easily transcends all musical confines and leaves behind little doubt that Otis Redding was one of the most important and gifted artists we've ever witnessed.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|On Saturday Feb 19th, I saw Pat Metheny Group play this entire song live at the Historical Fox Theater in Detroit, MI.  Pat, Lyle, Steve and Rest of the Pat Metheny Group have done an Awesome and Magnificent job.  This entire 68 minute song will take you on a musical journey up into areas never explored by the Pat Metheny Group.  What I like about this album is the fusion used to piece it all the together.   I can't wait to get this Awesome 68 minute song live on DVD.  This will be added to my collection of Great and Wonderful music that PMG has made over the past years.  PMG Fan's you won't be disappointed when you buy this CD.
1593080220|5.0|In this 1910 story of Edwardian England, Forster illustrates the conflicts between the superior attitudes of the aristocracy and a developing feeling of obligation toward the \\"lower\\" classes which World War I will soon bring into sharp relief. Margaret and Helen Schlegel are intellectual and sensitive to the arts, with compassionate hearts for those less fortunate.<br /><br />When Margaret, at age twenty-nine, is affianced to Henry Wilcox, the much older, widowed husband of a friend, this conflict of attitudes is brought to the fore. Henry, insensitive and believing himself actually entitled to his family's privileges, is cold and reserved, though Margaret believes that \\"Henry must be forgiven and made better by love.\\"<br /><br />Helen, her sister, a 21-year-old with an enthusiasm for the life of the imagination, has no sympathy for Henry's failure to pay attention to the people \\"below him\\" who are dependent upon his whims. Eventually, a casual remark by Henry leads to the loss of a job for Leonard Bast, a penniless young clerk, but Henry refuses to accept any responsibility whatsoever and refuses his wife's entreaties to give the destitute Leonard a job.<br /><br />Immensely sympathetic to the economic position of the poor and women, Forster illustrates their financial dependence on others. Margaret, who secures the reader's total sympathy, is charged with educating a close-minded dolt like Henry to be kinder and more empathetic towards the people he considers below him, but she achieves only limited success.<br /><br />Filled with incisive observations and great wit, the novel follows the narrative pattern of a melodrama, but Forster's sensitivity to both sides--the practical and conservative values of Henry vs. the emotional and idealistic sides of Margaret and Helen--elevates the novel above the tawdry. Henry is a product of his time and his class, but though times are changing, he is too dense to realize it. The Wilcox home at Howard's End is a microcosm, and its conflicts are those of the nation at that time. Thoughtful and entertaining, Howard's End still draws in readers after almost a hundred years. Mary Whipplee nation at that time. Thoughtful and entertaining, Howard's End still draws in readers after almost a hundred years. Mary Whipple
0066620996|4.0|I know a few business owners who desperately need this book.  Collins points out what should be common sense but isn't:  the key to corporate success is discipline.  A company needs to take control of itself, its employees, and its resources and get everything moving in the same direction.  Collins and his team engaged in an incredible amount of research, and manage to lay out the results in clear and concise dialogue.  Instead of being full of catch phrases and feel good mantras like so many other so-called success books, Good to Great actually provides real information and practically step by step instructions on getting your company on track in a positive way.
B000002KXV|5.0|The voice of Steely Dan with a new direction. You will know many of the songs, I always thought it was some SD album that I never heard of.
B00009MGGP|5.0|Francis Urquhardt is a vile, despicable, and lovely and charming man. Viewers will delight in his likerously evil cunning, and his artless and patronizing charm. Certainly the best portrayal of wicked aristocrat since Charles Grey in DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER, and actually much better, because it's not played for camp at all. Sadly, the conspiracies that FU weaves seem terribly tame considering the escalation of REALPOLITIK in the real world in the last few years, so much of the plot feels dated. And unlike A Very British Coup, this actually entertains, instead of just being shrill. Every prospect pleases and Francis Urquhardt is only vile!
B0006GAOBI|1.0|As a devoted fan of the theatrical release, I was deeply disappointed with the Directors Cut. The new footage and assorted changes add nothing substantive or interesting and the attempt to \\"explain all\\" reveals that the director himself does not understand what made the original one of the great cult movies in recent years -- that incredible mind-blow at the end of the movie, with only a clue as to what you just witnessed. With all the hitting you over the head with the \\"meaning behind the story\\", the wonderment was completey ruined. <br /> <br />So, if you've never seen Donnie Darko before, do yourself a huge favor and steer clear of this version and get the theatical release. If you have seen it already, don't waste your money on it either, since you will be bummed out by what the director has done.
0316172324|3.0|While reading this book, I was explaining some of Gladwell's ideas to a friend, and he made a joke.  He said, \\"If first impressions are so important, why not just read the first page?\\"  The joke more or less ruined the rest of the book for me, because, in essence, that's really what Gladwell is suggesting; that there is little importance in giving things a thorough examination. <br />We live in a country where we just had a national election in which not one critical issue was discussed, where reality tv shows  sweep the ratings, where book sales plummet yearly and technology makes immediacy ever more marketable, even while our children's learning is outpaced by the educational systems in third world nations, and I can't help the feeling that a book that encourages more shallowness is exactly what we don't need. <br /> <br />Most of the support for his argument about the value of snap decisions is pretty obvious.  Who doesn't put a lot of faith in their own intuition?  On the other hand, Gladwell's descriptions of where snap decisions went wrong, specifically his study of Warren Harding, makes for great reading.  But the fact that Gladwell included it more or less disproved his own thesis. I wish that had been the subject of the book, but I'm sure that wouldn't have been as marketable. <br /> <br />All in all, a well-written and polished work that was too vague to make a powerful impression.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|ok first of all, whoever says that this movie is dumb is so CLOSED-MINDED! For whoever was talking about there is only one good song and the girl kisses the phantom then goes to the other guy and then kisses the phantom is 100% WRONG!!! Andrew Llyod Webber writes the greatest music and every song adds depth and emotion into the movie. And if you actually PAYED ATTENTION to the movie's interesting plot, you would realize that there's a very important reason for everything done in the movie. <br />     Some people claim that Gerard Butler is a bad phantom. I don't understand why they would think this. His acting abilities are supurb and you really feel for him and learn to love his character. Butler is not a professional singer and, honestly, I thought his voice was terrible when I first saw the movie. However, when I watched it the second time, I realized that he really wasn't a bad singer, he just doesn't have a traditional opera voice. But it's kind of a good thing because his voice adds to the pahntom character.  <br />     Emmy and Patrick did excellent as their characters. Minnie Driver was hilarious! And she sings a wondeful song at the end. Some people say that \\"Learn to be Lonely\\" is a stupid song, but if you listen to it, you feel EVEN MORE for the phantom (if that's possible) All in all, I think people just need to be more open-minded when it comes to watching movies, ESPECIALLY musicals!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|The PMG has done it this time with their latest release, The Way Up. This 4 Part musical work is artfully composed and produced like a symphony. Each movement transitions from one beautiful jazz theme to next, with ribbons of previous themes in the part that follows. The individual performer's instruments are showcased and given their \\"do\\" time to please the listener, and boy do they.  Metheny brings you around full circle to close with threads from the opening themes.  This is masterfully executed in a harmonically satisfying and emotional way that gently sets you down peacefully to a close.  Audiophiles will be pleased to know the Right Track Recording Studio has delivered an absolutely delicious recording, that is well engineered and mixed down to excite the circuitry of high-end, high-resolution audio systems.  Barring a quick EQ distortion in Part 3, critical listening will be a delight with this CD, as there are a lot of shimmers for the tweeters, warm melodic sounds for the mid-ranges, as well as some intense string bass notes for the subs.  This CD is a must have for any contemporary Jazz lover and does not disappoint. We can only hope that PMG continues in this high quality pursuit.  The Way Up is definitely the way to go.
1401301010|2.0|I had no idea who Anthony Kiedis is and if I ever heard a song by the Red Hot Chili Peppers, I didn't realize, but since I (normally) enjoy biographies, I picked up this book.<br /><br />When Mr. Kiedis' mom wants him to obey the rules, he moves to California to live with his dad, whose rules are that he use drugs and have sex at a very young age, and have as little supervision as possible.  The son later rewards the dad's great parenting with a new house, new car, and new furniture.  (His mom rates a new car and a hot tub).<br /><br />Mr. Kiedis meets most or all of the criteria for Conduct Disorder (as a child and adolescent)and Sociopath (as an adult). He brags on pranks that hurt others, but expresses no remorse.  He is super-critical of others, but seems always content with his own bad behavior.  Mr. Kiedis talks a Japanese virgin into having sex with him and seems to think he deserves an award. He goes into rehab (many times) and seems surprised to learn that his drug use has an effect on others.  This didn't stop him though - it's just something he mentions in passing.<br /><br />Mr. Kiedis seems quite enamored of himself and his ways.  He puts down others who don't have what he considers to be \\"style\\".  He loves pure white alabaster skin, and the word \\"exponentially\\".  When his best friend dies of a drug overdose, he blows off the funeral, preferring to jet off to Mexico with his girlfriend (of the moment) Ione Skye.  He has no problem kicking other band members out of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but when it's his turn to be booted, he pouts, whines, and just can't believe his friends would do him this way.  Hey! Probably what the other guy was thinking.  But the other guy is of course not as important as ANTHONY. He also knowingly has sex with an underage girl.  Drug stories are described in loving detail - how happy he was when he barfed up a balloon of heroin that he had forgotten about!<br /><br />The book goes back and forth in time and is very inconsistent.  \\"Kentucky,\\" a girl he wanted to spend the rest of his life with, is described as having long black hair (and the requisite white skin of course).  A few pages later, he swoons over her \\"chestnut locks\\".  Apparently he's gotten her mixed up \\"The Screamer\\" of the chestnut curls.  I don't think \\"Kentucky\\" is going to be impressed.<br /><br />Overall, this book is poorly written, badly chronologized, and has an author/subject who has the self-insight of a ten year old.  He never had to grow up.  So why should he?anted to spend the rest of his life with, is described as having long black hair (and the requisite white skin of course).

B000000OSE|4.0|1.) Right Next Door to Hell: 8/10 Good fast-paced song, but not quite up to par with Welcome to the Jungle. <br />2.) Dust n' Bones: 6/10 Not bad, but a little too mellow and slow for my taste. <br />3.) Live and Let Die: 9/10 Nice cover of a Paul McCartney's Song; awesome vocals <br />4.) Don't Cry: 9/10 Sure its overdramatic and sappy, but you can't say it ain't good <br />5.) Perfect Crime: 7/10 Viciously fast, but I think the music and the vocals clash with each other <br />6.) You Ain't the First: 5/10 Eh, nothing memorable <br />7.) Bad Obession: 10/10 This song is sweeet. Axl sounds awesome on this song, and I like the intro. <br />8.) Back Off Bitch: 8/10 Nothing really special but definitely worth listening to, but I think It's so Easy makes better use of the word bitch <br />9.)Double Talkin' Jive: 9/10 Awesome guitars in the beginning, and the chorus is catchy <br />10.) November Rain: 10/10 A must-have for GNR fans; it's a classical beast <br />11.) The Garden: 8/10 A good song, not filler by any means <br />12.) Garden of Eden: 8/10 Okay, this is another short intense song, a little better than Perfect Crime, but it's hard to hear the vocals <br />13.) Don't Damn Me: 9/10 Just plain cool <br />14.) Bad Apples: 8/10 It's really not that bad, but kind of gets shadowed by the really good tracks. <br />15.) Dead Horse: 9/10 Awesome song, if a bit dark <br />16.) Coma: 10/10 A ten-minute powerhouse, sweet way to end the album <br />So i guess this album gets an 83/100 in total, but it's definitely worth picking up.
B00005JNPZ|2.0|It's changed to overeager! Why do they do that?<br /><br />Hitch is a date advisor who gets geeks hooked up with gorgeous girls who wouldn't look at them otherwise.  They have to be rich geeks, though, otherwise, Hitch can't take them on, he doesn't do this for free.<br /><br />This could have been a good movie, but it just wasn't.  Don't waste your time or money.
B000000OQF|5.0|Guns n' Roses' first album is definitely their best, with classics like Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City, and Sweet Child O' Mine. But I especially like Nightrain, Mr. Brownstone, and Rocket Queen, which are all awesome rock songs that deserve some major praise. It's so Easy is also a lovably misogynistic song that makes my friends and me burst out laughing every time we hear it (i.e. \\"turn around b*tch i've got a use for you) This is one cd where the thought will never cross your mind to skip a song. This is what rock was meant to sound like.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Love Tony Bennett. Bennett referred to Michael Buble in a recent interview as \\"the best voice there is\\" and said he has \\"the magic not seen since Sinatra - women swooning and guys enjoying his music around the globe\\" - well that was enough to convince me that Michael Buble is the Real Deal. <br />Love this cd, it's charged full of great interpretations of standards, some younger some older but all good.   <br />It's time is a can't miss cd for you or your friends.
B000000OSG|5.0|1.) Civil War: 10/10 An awesome way to kick off the album, theres some real depth to the song even tho I'm not a hippie by any means <br />2.)14 Years: 8/10 Compared to Civil War it's not as good but I never skip it <br />3.) Yesterdays: 7/10 A little less memorable than even 14 Years, still not bad. <br />4.) Knockin' On Heaven's Door: 10/10 Axl's voice is so weirdly cool in this song. <br />5.) Get in the Ring: 7/10 It's not horrible, but it could use a little more SINGING instead of ranting <br />6.) Shotgun Blues: 9/10 Filled with delicious profanity <br />7.) Breakdown: 9/10 I like the deep voice that says \\"Let me hear it now\\" <br />8.) Pretty Tied Up: 8/10 Solid, good effort by Izzy <br />9.) Locomotive: 9/10 Amazing guitar riffs so I don't mind the length <br />10.) So Fine: 7/10 I can't really remember anything about this song but I don't remember hating it <br />11.) Estranged 10/10: Over 9 minutes of ecstasy <br />12.) You Could Be Mine: 10/10 This song plain rocks. <br />13.)Don't Cry: 9/10 First one's better <br />14.) My World: 2/10 Why is this here??????? It's not rock, I don't know what the hell it is. <br />Okay folks, this rates as an 88/100 so get out and buy it.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|It is a great shame you didn't enjoy this movie because of Ewans southern accent. I thought that he did a superb job, considering how strong his normal Scottish accent is. But you seem to have thought Albert Finney is a \\"native southerner\\" when he is actually British! I thought Ewan and Albert complimented each other perfectly in this film. I won't bother to summarize it, because that's already been done. All I can say is, this is my top three, maybe top two favorite film of all time!! You won't be bored for a second, you are kept constantly on your toes. Everything about this movie is splendid and EVERYONE needs t oview this! Be prepared, if you have a heart, you WILL cry at the end...definetely Burtons best film ever!
0440237688|4.0|This book is great for people that are interested in folklore and mythlogy. The book introduces the reader to a new world where there are family units and someone to remember everything from the past and the present. The book gives you insight to what a world would be like if there were no memories of all the bad and things that are not needed in the world. It also opens up the mind to a new idea that only one person would remember all of earths history. This book is a 4 star rating.
B000002U8G|5.0|Go get \\"Live At Pompeii\\" to link the ideas of Meddle with the monster that was Dark Side of the Moon.

0375420525|4.0|The story of The Navidson Record is extremely well done.  The characters, Navy, Karen, Chad, Daisy, Reston, Holloway, all come together in 3-D on the page.  They are complex characters that all are interlaced quite beautifully in the narrative.  And the narrative.  It's done very carefully, making it read like a documentary, with footnotes and side stories.  The Navidson Record touches on many levels, from the surface, which is a creepy story about a bizarre incident.  Getting under the skin, the Record touches on ideas of fear and aloneness.  The size of the house can be viewed in a few ways and that leaves interpretation for the reader.  I like viewing the house as one under distress.  The family is torn apart by a mystery.  Everyone, children included, are pulled away from the family as a unit of measure.  With a family divided the house seems expands.<br /><br />The character of Johnny Truant is not a likeable a character, in my opinion.  He's a punk who reaps what he sows.  Early on, he seems very two dimensional and cliche, something copied from Bukowski but not done nearly as well.  Truant seems trite through most of the novel.  The letters from his mother help you learn more about him.<br /><br />The publishing of House of Leaves is different than most conventional publications out there.  Upside-down type, boxed, crossed-out.  You name it.  It's interesting but not completely necessary.  At some points, I felt the format take away from what could've been better writing.  For example, Danielewski may have changed words to publish a page in a 1 inche by 1 inch box on a page.  While he achieved the publishing goal, the final words may have been weaker due to forced format.  Quite a few conversations in the book left me feeling that.<br /><br />House of Leaves is a very good book and I recommend reading Danielewski interviews regarding the writing process involved.  Quite interesting, and I respect his passion for wanting to revitalize paper and ink press.  He gets an A+ for that.  Also, if you are just carousing through the book, flipping pages without having read, looks quite intimidating, right?  Don't worry.  Dig right in.  It's worth the experience.ze paper and ink press.   He gets an A+ for that.   Also, if you are just carousing through the book, flipping pages without having read, looks quite intimidating, right?

0887307280|5.0|This is a well written book!  It's like a novel, you just can't put it down, because you want to know what'll happen next.  The author uses a style of making a specific point, and then provides a continuing real world story where he discussed these points with a real entrepreneur.    <br /> <br />Now if only Mr Gerber would write a book on finding an idea to start your own business! LOL
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Okay, so their look, sound, and even posters are blatant rip-offs from the golden era of the Beatles.  But for a band that borrows heavily from the classics, they still get so much just right.  High-energy \\"Rollover DJ\\" and \\"Are You Gunna Be My Girl?\\" make you want to dance in the hallway, but don't overlook the slower ballads.  \\"Move On\\", \\"Timothy,\\" and \\"Look What You've Done\\" are well worth the listen when you're in a mellower mood.  In fact, while the lyrics in the upbeat tunes can be pretty banal, it feels like they put a little more effort into the slower tracks.  Well done, Jet, and I hope to hear more of you in the future.
B0002XDODU|5.0|I'm a big fan of Rammstein, discovering them just after Mutter came out.  After being blown away by that album, I waited with anticipation for their next, afraid they would botch it.    When Reise Reise finally arrived, I played it with much excitement, and a bit of fear.  At first, I was disappointed, as it seemed a step back from Mutter.  There were a few tracks I liked, like Ohne Dich, Amerika, and Moskau, but the others didn't really seem to connect with me.    Over a few weeks, however, the tracks began to grow on me, and I began to see it, not as a step back from Mutter, but more of a step to the side.  I wouldn't say it's better than Mutter, but I don't think it's worse, either, hence the 5 stars.  Now here's a track by track breakdown:    Reise Reise-4.5/5  Great track, very haunting, kind of orchestral, and it just has a sense of emotional weight behind it.  I really can't think of a better way to describe it.  Very solid.    Mein Teil-3/5  Many people like it, but it's my least favorite.  The subject matter is pretty cool, but it just seems a bit... atonal for me.  Still, a lot of metal fans will probably love it.    Dalai Lama-4.5/5  If you liked Spieluhr, you'll like this.  Basically, it tells the story of a father and son flying home for mom's birthday, and they get hit by a wild storm.  The boy starts hearing the winds calling him to come join them, saying they are his brothers.  His father, so scared by the storm, holds the boy so tightly that he accidentally suffocates him.  Quite creepy, in my opinion.  Also, the fact that they based it on the Goethe poem \\"Erlkonnig\\" (and improved the story, I feel) is quite cool.    Keine Lust-5/5  Meaning \\"I don't feel like it,\\" this was the first song to really grow on me.  I really liked the verses, the sound being quite energetic, and I got a real sense of soaring in them.  Very hard to describe, but also very cool to hear.    Los-4/5  This song has a definitely different vibe to it, more laid back, but not without that signature Rammstein feel.  The word play, if you can find a decent translation, is also fun to look into.    Amerika 4.5/5  Does it bash America?  Somewhat, but hey, I don't think we're perfect, and I happen to agree with the theme of the song.  You, however, might not.  The song itself, on the other hand, is incredibly catchy, and you might find yourself singing along, especially because it is partially in English (a brilliant move, in my opinion, as it fits in with the theme of American culture spreading all over the world).  I liked it, you might not.    Moskau-4.5/5  Two positive points: Incredibly catchy (and I mean REALLY incredibly catchy.  Almost annoyingly catchy, but not quite.), and it has lyrics in Russian, which is pretty cool, I think.  A touch repetitive, but hey, nobody's perfect, eh?    Morgenstern-4/5  Good song, but not one of my favorites.  I don't know why, but it didn't really connect with me that much.  Musically, I thought it impressive (hence the 4 rating), but just not my cup o'tea.    Stein Um Stein-3.5/5  Same problems for me as Mein Teil, but those will probably be pluses to a lot of listeners.  Good screaming, good wordplay, and a creepy theme make it decent.    Ohne Dich-5+/5  Ok, this one is my favorite, I make no bones about that.  Nebel was one of my favorites from Mutter, and Rammstein definitely seems to be channeling Nebel here.  Slow, sad, and haunting.  Some people criticize them for going soft, but I consider this a brilliant demonstration of their range.  If they can have me bouncing my head to Keine Lust, yet at the same time feel real sadness at the lyrics of this song, it just goes to show how good they are as musicians.  Musically, lyrically, and even placement wise (following the harder Morgenstern and Stein um Stein), this is a standout track.  Possibly my favorite Rammstein track (Nebel and Ich Will being other contenders).  Okay, enough of my ranting.    Amour-4/5  Interesting.  It's a slower song (kind of)and the comparison of love to a beast is cool.  I also thought that initial notes were cool.  The chorus is the best part, I think with the verses a little on the weak side.  It also ends well, I feel.    Okay, that's the album.  Rammstein fan?  Buy it, and listen to it over the course of a few weeks if it doesn't seem to click right away.  I think it will on repeated listening.  It did for me.    On a side note, if you want a good lyrics translation site, go to herzeleid dot com.  It's are not only very accurate, but also give cool little cultural notes to help you get some of the more subtle bits of the lyrics a straight translation might obscure.    Again, buy this album!
B000069CWE|2.0|I am a fan of Linkin Park. I have their 2 good albums, plus this one. I am one of the people who actually has this waste of money. Don't get this or Limp Bizkit's remix album New Old Songs. They should have been at least 3 studio albums into their career before releasing a remix album. Not just 1 studio album, which is not a very good move. The only reason to buy this is for the remixed tracks of 2 of their b-sides called High Voltage and My December. Even though these versions of those 2 songs are good, they should have also put the original versions of those songs on here. That would have made this a little better and maybe that would have gotten this 3 stars instead of 2. I don't see the point in having tracks 1, 4, 8, 10, 12, or 16 on here either. Why are they on here? If they wanted some other tracks on here why not make a couple of new songs for this or have the X-Ecutioners song Goin' Down on here, which had some of the Linkin Park members on it. Anyways, I don't recommend this album to anyone. Not even the Linkin Park fans out there. Hopefully we get a new album from Linkin Park soon.

He never owned Fawlty Towers but told me to watch it if I ever got the chance.  I was browsing Amazon one day and saw it on DVD, and I purchased it.  I am so glad I did!  I can say, the only Fawlt is that the series was cancelled after only 12 episodes!
B00070Q7VO|2.0|No, I didn't like the new CD at all. <br />He is going off 'the mark' of what works for him. Someone needs to tell Michael that he can't take ANYTHING and make it work for him. He has a niche in a certin type of music (big band, Sinatra, Darin,  etc.). THAT is his niche where he thrives not a remake of the Beetles and pop music! AGHHHH!
B0000C23DO|5.0|As a new fan of the grateful dead, I knew that I didn't want to shell out a lot of cash for all of the studio recordings AND the live stuff.  I decided to get this to cover their studio magic, and get live stuff to supplement it.  If you are a fan from back in the day, you don't need this disc.  If you are just getting into them like I am, this is required listening.  It is a terrific package, and one of my favorite to listen to of theirs.  The sound is terrific, and the selection is reasonably comprehensive of the best stuff.  YOU NEED LIVE MATERIAL by this band also, and I chose to get Europe '72, which has tons of stuff from their early period.  I might also get the other official live albums, aoxomoxoa and live/dead to go with this cd.  One of my personal favorite songs is Terrapin Station, so I bought a used copy of that cd (see my review of it). <br />Overall, if you are young do not miss out on one of the greatest 60's, 70's, and 80's bands!! pick this up right now!!
B0002NRRAG|1.0|I bought this cd a few days ago. When I put it on the cd-player and let it flow on, it immediately stunned me. <br />As a singer, I thought, I would pass my life getting over identity crisis if I had my voice even barely similar to Elvis' one, or Elton John's one, or Freddy Mercury's one. <br /> <br />Well, that's it: Madeleine Peyroux sings exactly (E-x-a-c-t-l-y) as Billie Holiday. My God, this is not a good thing. <br /> <br />I mean, this is probably the only reason for the release of this cd: Billie Holiday is old enough to be forgotten and renewed, and this young lady could be the new Lady Day. <br /> <br />But, in my opinion, it's so much better to prefer the original version to the... remix. And Madeleine Peyroux it's just an insignificant copy of the late, great jazz woman: Billie Holiday. <br />There are so many Billie's cd out there, buy some of them and enjoy... more and better.

0345442970|3.0|Mr. Luceno does an okay job at setting up the events that will take place in Phantom Menace. He gives us descriptions and reasons and explanations about things we saw in Phantom and things we only heard mentioned. The action isn't too intense, not like Labyrinth of Evil. Obi-Wan seemed a little too \\"green\\" of a Padawan and not as sure of himself as he was in Phantom. And there are some red herrings thrown at us about Senator Palpantine that only distracted and didn't enhance the story. Qui-Gonn is at the center of most of the story and much deserved. I thought that he was a cool character who, in Lucas fashion, was cut down before we could get to know more about him.<br /><br />If you are looking for an okay Star Wars book and want to find some more info about what happened behind Phantom, then this is your book.
0385510454|1.0|I bought this book because the story takes place primarily in Italy which I thought would be interesting and maybe educational.  However, the plot was poorly developed and the story did not have an ending.  A weak \\"love story\\" was also thrown in for good measure.  The use of Italian words and translations was stimulating but otherwise this book was a let down.  Lately, it seems like Grisham's publisher has him on a tight deadline for each new book he writes.  Quantity over quality.  His stories start out with an interesting idea but never really get developed (The Testament would be another example).

B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I attended the London Live Aid concert and it was awesome. Was trashed for a week after that gig. Some of my friends in the States attended the Phili side of the gig. It was fun to compare notes afterwards, as we all had excellent seating.  <br /> <br />I finally got the DVD's over the weekend and they are quite respectable. We can all complain about what should and should not be on these 4 DVD's but I am just happy they finally came out with them. Could they be better? Yes they could, but only a fool would not add this DVD set to their music library collection.
B00004SAAX|5.0|I'm not a big organ music fan- maybe it's because it reminds this atheist too much of church!  But the music here by Bach, and especially the playing by Walcha are just fantastic.  I was dubious that I could find interest in 11 CDs of organ music, but I'm enthralled by every minute of each disc.  A wonderful bargain!
B00003CXWV|5.0|I just saw this and wish I had much earlier. Depp is amazing and the director does an awesome job.

0767834739|1.0|This is terrible! <br /> <br />One of the worst films ever made. <br /> <br />I am a fan of Biohazard(Resident Evil) videogame, and compared to it, this film sucks. Although Anderson is calling himself a \\"fan\\" of this game, he is not a fan OF THIS game. A TRUE FAN would have never crated something like this. <br /> <br />These are the differences between a videogame and a film: <br />1 - In film: Nemesis is controlled by a computer(cyborg). <br />    In game: Nemesis is just smart, and he is not controlled by a computer. <br /> <br />2 - In film: Nemesis is created from the T-Virus(Matt was sliced by licker and infected with the T-Virus) <br />    In game: Nemesis was created using \\"Nemesis Parasite\\" and Nemesis Parasite was created in France. Besides most hosts possesed by Nemesis Parasite would die; and the hole process is unstable..... <br /> <br />3 - In film: T-Virus samples are stored in funky capsules made after DNA model. <br />    In game: T-Virus samples are stored in normal capsules, without any \\"cool\\" crap. <br /> <br />4 - In film: T-Virus is created by Dr. Ashford to save his dying child. <br />    In game: T-virus has a very long and twisted story; it was created by Dr. James Marcus by combining leech DNA and progenitor virus (Mother virus) to be used as a weapon. <br /> <br />5 - In film: In the end of the movie Alice can use a power of her mind to kill.(It sucks!) <br />    In game: There is no Alice; and there is no super crap mind powers. <br /> <br />6 - In film: The whole Raccoon City incident happens because the stupid named \\"Hive\\" lab was reopened.(Shouldn't the computer tell Umbrella HQ that the T-Virus was leaked?) <br />    In game: It happens because Dr. William Birkin was asassinated by Umbrella....(Rats were the carriers) <br /> <br />7 - In film: Raccoon City was bombed by Umbrella.(By doing so they tell US goverment that THEY ARE the ones responsible for this incident.) <br />    In game: It was bombed by US goverment. <br /> <br />There are many other stupidities in the film; and it sure is NOT connected to the game(unlike Anderson said). It's for you to decide if this film is good or not, but a true fan would never buy it. <br />
B0006GAOBI|4.0|The original Donnie Darko deserves 6 stars.  This reworking of the classic is definately worth the ride, even though it will disappoint most Darko disciples.  The additions and changes are extensive, and the mood and tenor of the original are modified significantly.  Some new visual insertions are somewhat disjointed, i.e., ocean waves appearing at seemingly inappropriate points.  New insights into \\"The Philosophy of Time Travel\\" through the flashing of various pages from the book add some excitement, but inevitably appear out of place and contrived.  The Michael Andrews score and the classic 80s & 90s songs in the original provided at least half of the eerie and bizarre mood, leading up to the thrilling anticipation of the climax with \\"Under the Milky Way\\" and finally with Andrews' \\"Mad World\\".  The remixed music in the Director's Cut is the most muddled and disappointing feature of the redux.  The only music Richard Kelly should have changed is the depressing durge at the ending credits. Additionally deflating is the redone climax.  Although more flashy, it adds no depth or dimension to the inter-dimensional denouement.  The original Donnie Darko is a rich hypnotic fantasy for affectionatos to obsess over.  The remake should be viewed once, and treated as an event that never really occurred, although the memory lingers.
B00005JNEI|1.0|This crockumentary just panders to the anti-bush crowd.  I have to hand it to Michael Moore, he knows how to make a buck off of stupid people. <br />There are so many dead-ends and lies in this movie.   <br />Read 59 Deceits of Fahrenhiet 9/11 and actually learn something instead of letting your brain atrophy to Moore's piece of garbage.
B00005JNSK|1.0|...and it hasnt even come out yet!!!! It seems nowaddays the only movies to make are ones that have been already made, this is where you gotta draw the line though. The orignal willy wonka was bananas! How are they gonna top the tunnel scene? Do you really think Johnny Deep can do a better willy than Gene Wilder? <br />Plus, you know they're gonna change all the songs (bad move). Not to mention in this Bush-era, with all the censorship and what not, you know they're not gonna have all the little adult jokes that the original had.  <br /> <br />but what really has me down about this movie was i reading about the writer, who had never seen the first prior to writing this film, and he said that he was surprised how DARK the first in comparision to his. <br /> <br />this one is gonna be strictly for the kids <br /> <br />its a shame
0765348780|2.0|I read several reviews that stated this was an incredible and creative fantasy series. So, in an effort to find new and exciting vistas for my imagination to play in, I got this book and started reading. After two weeks of struggling to get into the book, and finding no avenue by which I could gain entrance to Erikson's horrible world, I gave up (about page 250). This book is so disjointed, so poorly articulated, so lacking in characters one can identify with that it left me wishing I could forget all that I'd absorbed up till the time that I stopped reading. The first 100 pages are just leaps through time among pathetic scenes of morbidity. I hear the second book in this series is the better one, but I'll never give Erikson the chance to take me that far. A very disappointing book. Where is all the good fantasy these days?
B0006399FS|1.0|There's no one attempt to break out of the U2 comfort zone and do something a bit different. The whole album just doesn't go anywhere. Songwriting on this record is terrible. Moreover I cannot listen to more than about two songs without getting a headache because Bono's voice is so annoying. Bono had to do his raspy high-pitched scream in every song - except for their most boring song ever 'One Step Closer' - and make it all sound like garbage. Bono just grates. I just don't understand how everyone could have been so fooled. Is this a return to form? No, rather this is a return for the money. After all, they still have the name \\"U2\\". <br /> <br />U2 are completely sellouts <br />
1400032717|5.0|This is my new favorite book! Clever & brilliant! I only wish that this author had another for me to read! :o( Crossing my fingers for a sequel!!!
B0006399FS|4.0|I definitely agree that this is not their best album, but what the hell is wrong with you americans. All that 1 stars, all that extreme negatively about this record. <br /> <br />Look at the reviews on the english and the german amazon.com, they are significantly more positive. I guess that the record is too complicated for a lot of you americans. <br />
B0001AP12G|4.0|Who had heard of Kanye West before 2004? Not many, but this producer turned producer-rapper made a huge splash with this LP. It's got many fun hip-hop tracks that hold up on multiple listens, as well as a few repetitive, somewhat annoying songs, so you might wish to make your own mix of the ones you like best. Peak points on the album showcase what a solid producer West is. \\"Slow Jamz\\" and \\"Family Business\\" include great interweaving of R&B vocals and rapping. The album also has a heavy dose of what I've heard called \\"chipmunk soul,\\" where the producer takes old soul records, speeds them up, and then takes this sound and uses it as a backdrop behind modern beats and rhymes. It's pretty cool stuff.
B000274THQ|5.0|\\"Godbye Lenin\\" was one of the best foreign films released in 2004, which combined a love story and farce against the backdrop of the last days of the German Democratic Republic.  The plot is ingenious: to prevent his frail mother, a mid-level loyal appratchika, from suffering a second and fatal heart attack, her son must create a historical \\"bubble\\" in her appartment to keep her convinced that the Communist regime is alive and well, and the universe has not changed.<br /><br />The fantasy world created by her son reflects the actual paper-mache universe that was East Germany.  The Wall must stay up; dumpsters must be scoured for old food cans with the right labels, and mediocre laminate furniture recovered.  His job is made more difficult as the real world and its billboards inevitably intrude, to which he and a friend respond by taping fake talking-head broadcasts which look like the real dull as bricks productions.  I had always suspected that Coca Cola was invented in the GDR and stolen by the West....<br /><br />Some have unfairly criticised this movie by being too \\"soft\\" on the East German regime, and in its sympathetic portrayal of the mother as a loyal adherent to the system.  That was not the point of this movie.  Waking up on a November 2000 morning to find that Bush, and not Gore, was declared president was significant enough; the millions who saw the Wall collapse and have their entire society change must have been thousands of times more traumatic.  Many, many people who were not ideologues still had a stake in the old system, such as university professors, teachers, and factory workers.  Their world, like that of the East German astronaut, was turned upside down without any fault of their own.  This film succeeds in describing this trauma in a gentle and thoughtful way.
B000092ZYX|3.0|Radiohead has obviously got a really great creative streak going, and as musical artists, there aren't any other musicians out there that can produce songs that are as complex and interesting ... and sell hundreds of thousands of records at the same time. Upon the first listen, my mood was not a happy one, so Hail to the Thief almost acted as a reverse Prozac pill, Thom Yorke's soupy voice and the collage of sometimes tense sounds dragging me further into a stew of despair. So what I'm saying is that this is not a terribly upbeat album. But it's a meaningful one, with great passages involving techno-ized beats (a la Kid A and Amnesiac) and other great moments with lots of exciting guitar layers (a la OK Computer and The Bends). A recent Radiohead show at Red Rocks featured lots of Thom Yorke playing guitar, so one gets the sense that the instrument has once again become a feature instrument in their songwriting structure. This is a good thing, as the group has always been able to make powerful guitar rock that has an intellectual appeal.
0451529308|5.0|Alcott's 'Little Women' is delightful and heartwarming, ever since I started reading it at 10 years old. The novel never fails to show me how we all make mistakes, we all fail, and we all triumph. Some of my friends have told me the book is boring, slow-paced, and idealistic. Little Women is simply about a family facing trials during the Civil War, and every chapter presents a fresh situation with a good deal of humor too. Alcott's style allows you to feel you are one of the March family, and her development of all characters is fantastic. Her details and dialogue allow the story to flow smoothly, and I've learned a lot from this great piece of American literature. I never tire of reading Little Women. It's that wonderful.
B00001ODGR|5.0|Styx, the most Mythical and musical rock band of all time put  on one of the greatest rock concerts of all time! This concert is a killer from start to finish.I got 'goose bumps'throughout the  set by the Melodious/Harmonious  voices of masters Tommy Shaw and Dennis de Young, these guys rocked the Chicago (home) crowd to classic Styx songs as Crystal Ball,Come Sail Away,Renegade,Blue Collar Man,Lady,Boat on the River and many more of their hits. The musicianship is a 10..Tommy and J.Y ripped through the crowd with precision 'Styx' solos tommy's acoustic performances on 'crystal ball' and fooling yourself is so heart warming he even played the  'mandolin' on   the breathtaking 'Boat on the river'!De Young trademark 'dreamy' keyboard was refreshing as ever, so was his showmanship.J.Y even rocked the frenzied 'Paradise' crowd to his  Miss America and Snowblind,Todd's drumming would have made the late John Panazzo really proud as it  really got emotional when the band paid tribute to him (John) as De young sang 'Show me the Way'.  <br />Bassist Chuck Panazzo who appeared unmoved throughout the set played remarkably.Truly a Classic Styx performance. <br />The menu,sound and video on this concert are all 10!For this price at Amazon it a 'Steal'!
1400032717|5.0|Occasionally, you read a book expecting something, and get something else. If you're lucky, what you get is more than you expected: more informative, more entertaining, more amusing, something that adds to your enjoyment. Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time is a book like that: you go into it thinking it's a mystery, but it's so much more, and extremely well-done to boot. <br /> <br />When I was a kid, I was introduced to the books of Chaim Potok, the Jewish Rabbi who wrote books about life in the Jewish community in New York City. One of the things that impressed me the most about his books was that when he chose to make a child the narrator of a story, he wrote that narration in a voice that was believably a child's, without making what was written childish, so that you'd not be interested in the book. Potok's characters were brilliant (one went on to become a world-famous artist in the latter part of one novel) but they were relatively well-adjusted and able to interact with those around them. What makes Curious Incident so unique and worthwhile is that the main character, Christopher Boone, is autistic, and can't relate to other people on an emotional level. This is fascinating, and the author apparently knows a great deal about autistics. <br /> <br />The result is a fascinating look into the mind of someone whose head is wired differently from the rest of us. He's brilliant at mathematics and physics, has a photographic memory, and is hyper-observant, to the point of sensory overload that can put him into a stupor, if he's somewhere unfamiliar. This is the sort of person who should be living with a millionaire in a mansion somewhere, so that his talents can be properly utilized and his foibles can be gently dealt with and perhaps, with time, mitigated. Instead, of course, Christopher lives in the real world (a small town outside of London called Swindon) where his father works repairing plumbing, his mother is dead, and he goes to a\\"special needs\\" school. When the story opens, Christoper narrates that he found a neighbor's dog lying dead, killed by someone with a garden fork, and he kneels down and holds it. When the owner of the dog discovers him, she decides he must have killed it, and calls the police, and off we go on our story, with Christopher deciding he must find out who killed the dog himself. Among other things, you see, he's obsessed with Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson, and so he understands how to detect things. <br /> <br />When he discovers who killed the dog, he also, inadvertently, discovers other things about his life. These things (I won't tell you what they are, it's too big of a surprise) drive the last half of the book, and are interesting. It's wonderful to see Christopher deal with things that he doesn't understand, because he approaches everything in what he considers a very logical manner. Sometimes, his logic leaves a great deal to be desired, but internally it makes sense. <br /> <br />In case you hadn't guessed, I enjoyed this book a great deal. I read a lot of books (more than anyone I know...over a hundred a year) and this is one of the very best I've ever read. I would recommend this book to anyone, and will be recommending it to anyone who will listen to me.
B0001ZX0PG|1.0|This movie was a boring downer.  Well done, but why do it.  Why make something so depressing with no redeeming value?  Dark, darker and shockingly amoral.  Get something that will make you feel good, instead.
0316172324|3.0|definitely more of a \\"rental\\" (i.e. used) than a purchase.  It's a quick read, starts off with an interesting notion, but the second half of the book didn't have much to say nor did it deliver a strong conclusion.  There are some interesting stories in between, including evidence suggesting we are all biased in some ways, but nothing original.  The bottom line here is that with experience, your intuition on areas of YOUR expertise improves.  Wow.
B00006AUIG|4.0|If you like eery and creepy stuff then this is the ticket for you and if you are suffering from Nycthophobia or Clastrophobia then this is not the movie for you. David Caruso (Tv's NYPD Blue and CSI: Miami), Peter Mullan (Shallow Grave, The Claim), Josh Lucas( Wonderland, The Deep End), Brendan Sexton III (Desert Blue, Boys Dont Cry)and Stephen Gevedon (who also co-wrote the movie) are hired by Peter Guilfoyle(Tv's CSI:Las Vegas, Striptease) to get rid of hazardous asbestos and other toxic things (crocolidite etc ) in a abandoned insane asylum. Gevedon wonders around the place and digs into one of the buildings past history cases with 9 Session tapes and things happen around the place that are, well a little bit freaky and weird. Atmosphere is key and so is the level of tension built into the characters. That chair in the middle of the hallway with light beaming on it from an open door is way creepy, too bad no one sat on it. Mullan gives a bravo performance and Caruso does his usual thing.  <br />
B00007L4LL|4.0|If you're a Hugh Jackman fan you'll love this movie (I did!).  He's so appealing and truly does a fine job of acting.  As the Duke of Albany, he's unwittingly brought into modern times by a time travel concept -- so you must also be open to the time travel idea to best enjoy the film.  Meg Ryan is stuck in \\"Meg Ryan\\" mode - if you saw her in \\"You've Got Mail\\" and several films, you know what she's like here.  Kind of cute but not really that different than ever before.  All together, though, it's a cute romantic film if you just let yourself go with it.
B0002V7ODI|3.0|Hellboy is directed by Guiellrmo Del Toro(Mimic and Blade 2) and stars Ron Perlman(Blade 2, Star Trek:Nemesis), Selma Blair(Storytelling, Kill Me Later), Karl Roden(Bulletproof Monk, Blade 2) and Jeffrey Tambor(Teaching Mrs. Tingle, The Grinch2001). The movie is a great ride with Ron Perlman as a fantastic Hellboy giving off 100%. To me though I think the end kinda wore it down a bit but other then that it was one hell of a trip. The higlight is where Hellboy is stalking down Selma Blair's character who's with FBI guy John Myers and the little kid is giving Hellboy advice on girls.
B00077BC2G|4.0|Definitely a little more mature than the previous 2 Harry movies.  All 3 lead characters and actors are beginning to look like teens (there's even a brief scene of hand-holding -- VERY BRIEF!).  The plot is a bit darker than before and the images a bit darker - I would think this film might disturb the younger Harry fans, but might very much please the slightly older ones because it's more mature.  The scenes are a bit more violent than previously.  ALl in all, though, it's a fun film and I, as an adult, enjoyed it, too!
0783229526|2.0|Unfortunately I tend to divert the critics a lot of the time and a lot of the critics did not like this movie....I however am on the neutral side to this movie...yes it's like being in la-la land with a couple of guys who go on a adventure in which you dont know what it's about half the time but the one reason I liked this is the fact that Johnny Depp (Blow, Secret Window) is damned believable in his performance even though Benicio Del Toro (21 Grams, The Way Of The Gun) sometimes is. The movie itself is one big huge drug endused acid trip circling the air, filling the screen with over-the-top nonsense and digusting dizzy conversations bouncing around off the walls trying to make your head explode. This film just might of giving Depp his weirdest and strange performances ever. Spot cameos by the following: Tobey Maguire (Spider-man 1-2), Craig Bierko (The Thirteenth Floor), Mark Harmon (Summer School), Tim Thomerson (Near Dark), Penn Jillette (Penn and Teller Get Killed), Cameron Diaz (Vanilla Sky), Lyle Lovett (The New Guy), Flea (Back To The Future 2), Gary Busey (Lethal Weapon), Christina Ricci (Buffalo 66)), Michael Jeter (Open Range), Harry Dean Stanton (Paris, Texas), Christopher Meloni (Tv's Law and Order:SVU) and Ellen Barkin (The Big Easy). Look fast for the following actors: Jenette Goldstein (Near Dark), Richard Riehle (Office Space) and Verne Troyer (Austin Powers 2 and 3). Hunter S. Thompson, who just passed away, fans of his might find some value to this movie....and to the rest, I say this once....every movie if crappy or not...watch it once...then if you dont like it...then dont watch it again...that's my advice.
B000005RQT|5.0|I alternate between this album and Machinhead as my favorite Deep Purple studio recording, but don't let that fool you.  They are very different albums.  In Rock is, without a doubt, their heaviest and hardest album; it is the most metal that they got.  Machinehead, on the other hand, while a great hard rock album, is less metal and more refined. <br /> <br />This was probably my fifth Deep Purple album that I purchased, way after Made in Japan, Machinehead, Fireball, and Perfect Strangers.  Knowing that Fireball preceded Machinehead, I expected this album to be softer, more along the lines of Fireball.  Boy, was I surprised.  This album definitely ranks as one of the best first albums put out by any band.

B000005Z0E|3.0|As the album meant to introduce 2Pac to the world (including law enforement and former Vice President Dan Quayle) as a solo artist \\"2Pacalypse Now\\" suceeds. Often forgotten when the topic of the 2Pac catalogue surfaces \\"2Pacalypse Now\\" made more of an impact controversially than it did musically. The anti-cop rants that echo throughout tracks like \\"Young Black Male\\", \\"Trapped\\", \\"Soulja's Story\\", \\"I Don't Give A F**K\\", \\"Violent\\", and \\"Crooked A** N**ga\\" are more than enough to raise a few eyebrows and bring about a few gasps in conservative suburbia. But for these people they also made Shakur's softer side easier to ignore. This album is also laced with tales of inner-city pain depicted in tracks like \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\", \\"Part Time Mutha\\", \\"If My Homie Calls\\", and the not surprisingly educated \\"Words Of Wisdom\\". Shakur is clearly at his best and most \\"himself\\" when his vulnerability shines through. His blunt take on ghetto life and passion-filled voice could earn sympathy from the most ruthless of listeners. Despite this album being home to some arguably classic tracks (\\"Words Of Wisdom\\", \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\", etc...) as a whole it's not nearly impressive as his classic album releases \\"Me Against The World\\" and \\"The 7 Day Theory\\". Actually, \\"2Pacalypse Now\\" isn't even within reaching distance of the often overrated \\"All Eyez On Me\\" and is only in the rearview mirror of  Shakur's 1994 release \\"Strictly 4 My N.I.G.G.A.Z...\\" Though even \\"Strictly 4 My...\\" is more impressive as a whole. In fact, the only 2Pac affiliated record to be released prior to his death that \\"2Pacalypse Now\\" can touch is the rather disapointing \\"Thug Life: Volume 1\\". An album recorded with a \\"group\\" (more like a bunch of guys thrown together) which for the most part has fallen off the face of the Earth since (nobody has cared enough to file a missing person's report as of yet though). At least one of the members (possibly more) did stick around to record with Shakur's later asembled Outlawz clique (see many tracks from the Death Row/Makaveli era and the album \\"Still I Rise\\") though.
B00005JKHN|5.0|This is one of my favorite Disney movies of all time. I've just liked it ever since I was really little and am very happy that I have it on DVD.<br /><br />It's the story of Princess Auora and the three faries. I actually likeMalificent. I think it's because of her colors. There are also some fun extra features for kids like an interactive coloring book and a game to try<br /><br />and save Princess Auora.
0684857219|5.0|What appealed to me about Arnold's training program is that you develop the entire body from different angles, you create shape and a quality that can not be achieved by these HIT and HEAVY DUTY PROGRAMS or other abbreviated training systems that limit you to a few sets and few exercises.  <br /> <br />Arnold proved that this is the best way to create a quality physique. In 1972 Sergio Oliva sent Arnie pictures of himself taken in Florida while Oliva was training for that years Mr. Olympia with Athur Jones Nautilus system aka HIT aka HEAVY DUTY. Oliva's arms were bigger thanhis head and his thighs were bigger than his waist! He was rock hard and tight. <br /> <br />Contest day, Arnold blew away the myth only because Arnold was more complete. More balanced. Oliva had taken the grotesque to the extreme and was freakish. Arnold looked a sculpted Michael Angelo statue. <br /> <br />In 1980, Arnold would do the same thing. Training only 7 weeks after a five years absense from competition, Arnold packed on 30 pounds of muscle and even in only 85% of his best shape beat Mike Mentzer, Boyer Coe, Frank Zane, Chris Dickerson and all the youngins who thought they were ready to replace \\"The Austrian Oak.\\" <br /> <br />Point? Arnold's system works. It's better than anything you have ever tried before and it's better than anything you have never tried before.  <br /> <br />If you want quality muscle, try Arnold's system. It works!
0743454529|5.0|I loved Jodi Picoult's Keeping Faith and have looked forward to reading another one of her eleven novels. My Sister's Keeper caught my attention.  The plot seemed interesting and compelling -- the actual reading experience was remarkable.  Anna Fitzgerald was born under some rather interesting circumstances.  She was conceived to be the bone marrow donor to her sister Kate, a victim of Leukemia.  After thirteen years of doctor visits, surgeries and treatments, Anna has enough and decides to sue her parents.  She wants to make her own decisions about the treatments and transplants.  There are other problems that are triggered by Kate's illness and the family face many obstacles.  There are various twists throughout the novel.<br /><br />This is one of the most beautiful and poignant stories I have ever read.  Picoult makes you feel the characters' emotions to the core.  I cared so much about the outcome of the Fitzgerald family that I stayed awake until the wee hours of the morning just to see what would happen.  The characters are absolutely wonderful.  Anna had such great vitality and I sympathized with her plights.  She often feels used and unloved, especially by her mother, whose devotion is solely given to Kate.  Sara (mother) upset me a lot in this novel.  I understood her concern for her ill daughter, but the way she utilized Anna appalled me.  As said earlier, I was able to feel Anna's desperate need to make her own decisions and to stop being used like a laboratory rat.  I loved My Sister's Keeper.  It is one of the best reads I've had this year thus far.  The ending was different than I had anticipated, but the overall novel is incredible.  I cannot recommend this gem enough.
B0006SSOHC|4.0|For those tired of the \\"California-teens-are-picked-off-one-by-one\\" horror/thriller film premise should find much pleasure in \\"Saw.\\" From the get-go, \\"Saw\\" is a disturbing game of master and servant as \\"the Jigsaw Killer\\" rounds-up disenchanted individuals and makes them pay for their own carelessness. A man who tried to take his own life by slicing his wrist was forced to decide on whether to die in a cell or navigate a path through barbed wire to reach the exit to freedom. A sort of test for these people who've previously made horrible choices in their life. Even the female early on in the movie who managed to get away from the killer (via succeeding in HER game) said that the experience changed her for the better. <br /> <br />A twisted vigilante for sure, but the evil lead doesn't tug on anyone's sympathies for long as \\"Adam\\" and \\"Lawrence\\" are forced to work together (yet against each other) to stay alive.  <br /> <br />While the acting amongst all characters isn't exactly Oscar-quality, you can't go into the movie thinking that's what's to be expected. This is an extraordinarily unique movie and should be treated as a morbid look at the human condition in times of stress and life/death. As well, the creepy games (like the one Mr. Suicide played above) that the victims must play in order to live are creative and compelling. <br /> <br />Fans of Rockstar Games' \\"Manhunt\\" should enjoy \\"Saw\\" immensely, by the way. The Jigsaw Killer and the Director from said game are very similar in approach and technique.  <br /> <br />Do not, however, be fooled by the grisly imagery of the DVD cover or any other mediums used to advertise the movie. This isn't a bloodbath. Some may be disturbed by the content, but most horror-philes should find it tame.
B000002MK8|5.0|When I was in first grade in 1993, my bus driver would always play 95.9 R96, and everyday after school and then a few days apart they played this version of \\"Having A Party\\" and I bought this CD 8 years later and still loved that song, and my friends listened to it and all remembered it as a favorite to all of us. Then a few years later I learned to like Rod Stewart even more and the entire CD is very good.
0790729628|5.0|In reference to \\"Blade Runner\\" I found this remark in one of the customer reviews:    \\"The only part I liked was when Blondy was killing the guy\\"    My god, is this getting very common or what?  I first thought the person didn't like the film because he/she was bored with the story because it didn't have a bunch of mindless action adventure scenes in it.  But, then I came across that sentence that I have been seeing time and time again in other articles dealing with older films.    It used to be, just 20 year ago, that mainly only men were killing evil men.  There were very few evil women and except for the victims of horror films women very seldom died in movies.  Sometimes I think \\"Blade Runner\\" got away with the good guy gunning down women because they were regarded as machines, computers or replicants.  Because, one thing you very rarely see is a good guy gunning down an evil female.    So, here we have someone stating that the only good part of this film is a woman gunning down a man.  Now why is it so wrong to have it the other way around?  Ever since the 1980's all of sudden women were killing the bad men but at the same time women organizations were complaining about the horror films showing women being murdered.    Well, the movie might make more since and wouldn't be as boring to these people if they could see the original version.  In the original version Deckard and Blondie (Rachael) are heading off together and Deckard states that he didn't know how much time they would have together because Rachael had unlimited time.  I do not know what is so horrible about that ending but who really does?
B0002858YS|5.0|This album truely shows the idea of rock and roll. band member gets left, band member gets inspired, band memebr kicks the crap out of the old band (who didnt have that great of a name) and makes it. this cd is a great cd for anyone who listens from easier rock to some of the harder rock but falls perfectly for the pop punkrunk genre like we see green day and new found glory in. with some of the more famous songs as \\"Mr. Brightside\\", and \\"Somebody told me\\" the band also give many other elements as you will see including choir music towards the end. this is a must have album.
0671027387|4.0|I must say, the beginning of this book compared to the Da Vinci Code was rather drab. It was a tad boring and it took me two months to get through the first 50 pages. Yes, TWO MONTHS. I finished the 400 pages in 2 days. It was so good. It captured my attention and my wife would get mad at me and tell me to go to sleep. I would tensely tell her \\"I think Pickering just died!\\" She knew not to bother me. I read the book till late into the night. I finished late the next morning. It was good good good. But the Da Vinci Code was better.<br /><br />Oh, and one more thing. I think Dan Brownn should come up with more creative endings. They all end the same. It is quite trashy.
B00005Y1XZ|5.0|The first three albums by Elvis Costello are not only his three best albums ever---they are three of the finest albums released by any artist of that era. While \\"My Aim Is True\\" stands as one of the greatest debut albums ever, I feel that his next two releases, \\"Armed Forces\\" and \\"This Year's Model,\\" were even better than his first excellent work. <br /> <br />\\"This Year's Model\\" is the peak of Elvis Costello's angry and cynical lyrical database, with fast, raucous music that ups the intensity like only Elvis could. When I think of the numerous punk groups of that era that I enjoyed like Black Flag, Sex Pistols and The Dead Kennedys, I take the odd step of lumping \\"This Year's Model\\" in with the same sarcastic emotion backing the music. While the abovementioned Punk groups may have marketed themselves to the kids who fancied themselves raw, gritty, and streetwise, Elvis seemed geared toward the everyday middle-class Joe who, despite no torn jeans or Mohawks, still possessed that bitterness toward commercialism and the rat race.    <br /> <br />This album has classic Costello rants that range from relationships gone sour to the greedy corporate world, with some songs like \\"Living in Paradise\\" seemingly combining both. The tunes grow increasingly intense with each track, with \\"Hand in Hand\\" and \\"Lipstick Vogue\\" grabbing most of the glory in the second half of the album. No resting, no misleading Guajardian twists, just sharp music and seething lyrics. <br /> <br />\\"Radio, Radio\\" is the appropriate finale of \\"This Year's Model,\\" which is a loud, fast, break-free tune that totally bashes the formula based model of commercial radio. I remember when this song was released, and how much I loved it every time I heard it played on one of the same commercial radio stations he was thumbing his nose at; it was like hearing an employee cursing out his boss and receiving a promotion for it. <br /> <br />Elvis Costello has since released quite a diverse array of music since \\"ThisYear's Model.\\" Some of it I love, some I don't get... but there is nothing quite like his first three albums. If you want to buy a \\"Best Of\\" Elvis Costello compilation, then STAY AWAY from his \\"Best Of\\" compilations. Buy his first three releases instead, because they truly are the very best of Elvis Costello. <br />
B00008GKEG|5.0|It started in Liverpool England.  What was set in motion was a rock band so incredible they changed the history of the world.  This ten hour DVD documentary is the Holy Grail of all Beatles documentaries.  It begins with family histories as Ringo says his mother always told him WWII started because he was born.  John, Paul, George, and Ringo came from the working class and soon found rock'n'roll and each other.<br /><br />  In their own words we hear the complete story from beginning to end.  From early recordings of 1958 on we can see the band developing from month to month, year to year.  The first good movie of them is at the Cavern right after Ringo joined with \\"Some Other Guy\\" with John's full-throated vocals, and the crowd asking, \\"Where's Pete?\\"  We get some great rare footage of them on the BBC as well as their tours.  Then they hit the States as the perfect antidote to the JFK assassination.  1964 was the year they took the world by storm as millions come down with Beatlemania.  1965 is the legendary Shea Stadium concert with 57,000 hysterical fans.  By 1966 they're already into LSD and Eastern music and philosophy.  Here we get the first (and greatest) rock videos of \\"Paperback Writer\\" and \\"Rain\\".<br />  Then after they snub the fascist queen of the Philippines they barely escape the island hellhole and decide that's the end of touring.  Then comes the most creative year ever, 1967.  \\"Strawberry Fields\\" and \\"Penny Lane\\" debut as trippy acid inspired videos on Ed Sullivan, \\"Sergeant Pepper\\" is released, Brian Epstein dies, \\"All you need is Love\\" debues on world satellite, and \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\".  By 1968 they are drifting apart, but not before creating \\"The White Album\\", \\"Abbey Road\\", \\"Let It Be\\", and \\"Hey Jude\\".
B0000C8AVM|5.0|This album changed my life. <br /> <br />All I wanted was to hear a pair of speakers... <br /> <br />When the salesman asked me if I had heard the new Dylan, I had to admit I hadn't.  Not very cool...but what had Bob done recently that was worth mentioning. <br /> <br />Well, Blood on the Track took me by storm.  I wore out my first vinyl copy and had to buy a second.  You won't find any Dylan that touches your heart like these songs.  These lyrics will haunt you.  I didn't sleep for weeks.  Tangled Up in Blue....If You See Her Say Hello...Shelter From the Storm...these songs are dynamite.  Absolutely his greatest achievement. <br /> <br />Dylan's gift to mankind.  Make sure you have your own copy to weep over...

B0006SSOHC|5.0|As someone who is admittedly addicted to horror films, I'd like to think I've seen it all. But every now and then, a movie comes along, takes me by surprise, and knees me in the groin. \\"Saw\\" is that film. From beginning to end, this movie is pure intensity. Directed by the young James Wan, who is just getting started in the business (and got one helluva headstart with this movie), \\"Saw\\" revolves around two seemingly unrelated men (Cary Elwes and Leigh Whannell) who wake up opposite of each other in a dirty, stinky, sketchy old bathroom, chained to the pipes and with a dead body loafing in between them. It seems that someone is playing a game with them, someone who selects the players in his game for a reason. He doesn't actually kill these people himself, but somehow, they end up dead (sound familiar, Kevin Spacey fans?). Hot on his trail, in a simultaneous subplot is Detective David Tapp (played by Danny Glover), who has a has a vendetta against one of the men trapped in the room. The movie moves at a brisk pace. It is absolutely unrelentless and virtually humorless. There isn't a moment where the movie sags, or where you, the viewer, can relax. Everytime you think you've wrapped your head around this movie, a curveball is thrown at you, straight up until the knock-out ending. I really can't explain much more about the plot without ruining parts of the movie. No doubt, this movie bares similarities with \\"Se7en,\\" both in the story (which was also penned by Whannell) and in Wan's directing style. However, instead of coming off as derivitive, Wan uses his obvious influences to paint a totally different picture. He uses some stark, nightmarish images to full effect (check out the child abduction scene...how creepy) and turns old cliches (Adam's apartment scene) on their heels. The story, and more importantly, the characters are what's important here. Whannell created two very different, flawed, but sympathetic leads that we really start to care for, despite whatever events unfold (I saw a little of myself in Adam). Overall, I can't find a flaw in this film. It is just mind-blowing. It is perfectly crafted. Every little shot in this movie is in there for a reason, so pay attention. \\"Saw\\" is more than just your average thriller, and it doesn't reduce to splatterfest either (although there are some grisly scenes). Easily the best horror flick to come out last year. Fans of the genre should not miss it. The DVD is a little disappointing, with the mere highlight being the insightful commentary from Wan and Whannell. Also included is a feature, albeit brief, on the making of the movie, along with two versions of Fear Factory's \\"Bite The Hand That Bleeds\\" video and a making of the video segment. Pretty skimpy for a landmark release like this. I smell a re-release on the horizon (?).ents unfold (I saw a little of myself in Adam). Overall, I can't find a flaw in this film.

B00005JKWJ|5.0|The daywalker known as \\"Blade\\" ( Wesley Snipes) is back! but this time, there is a race of powerful vampire creatures known only as \\"Reapers\\", they are parasitic genetically enhanced vampiric beings that suck the blood of both humans and vampires alike as they are bent on draining the lives of both races. A new order vampire clan joins up with Blade and Whistler ( Kris Kristofferson)as they both must be with the clan to exterminate these new breed bloodsuckers.<br /><br />An electrifying and ultraviolent sequel to the 1998 hit based on Marvel Comics vampire flick that reunites Wesley Snipes and Kris Kristofferson with of course a new cast most reconigizably Ron Perlman from Hellboy and City of Lost Children as one of the vampire warriors. Director Guillermo Del Toro's style for this movie is just impressive as it triumphs over the original in anyway with more action, more vampires ( but some different ones this time), more gore, better acting and fantastic martial arts sequences that are cherographed nicely.<br /><br />The 2-Disc DVD has great stuff like crisp picture & Sound, two audio commentaries, isolated scroe, Deleted/Alternate scenes with commentary, galleries, documentaries, music video, trailer, and DVD Rom content. This is a must have DVD for the fanatics of horror movies, action, comic book movies, and vampire flicks alike, you won't regret it.
B00019074O|4.0|There was nothing at Blockbuster Video.  All the new ones were gone.  The low-budgets collect dust.  Even Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle (2004) was gone.  So I mosied on over to comedy to find \\"The Four Seasons\\" (1981) with Carol Burnett, Alan Alda, Sandy Dennis, Rita Moreno.  They never even heard of it.  What I did find was all seven \\"Police Academy\\" movies and to make it more exciting, they were all on DVD.      Okay, I need to relieve some tension.  I'll watch rookie cops be stupid.  Besides, Steve Guttenberg and Marion Ramsey are funny and that guy from the M*A*S*H tv series is in it too.    The first film includes the cast of 11 rookies: Steve Guttenberg, Kim cattrall (Porky's {1981], Sex In The City tv series), Bubba Smith, Andrew Rubin, David Graf, Michael Winslow, Bruce Mahler (\\"Fridays\\" tv shows), Scott Thopson, Brant Van Hoffman, Marion Ramsey and Donovan Scott.    They all must get through the Police Academy and obey the orders of G.W. Bailey (M*A*S*H tv series) and Leslie Easterbrook (Laverne & Shirley tv series).  To add to the comic relief, George Gaynes, Debralee Scott, Ted Ross (The Wiz), Gary Farmer (Powow Highway [1989]) and Georgina Spelvin (the age-over-40 adults know what other movies she has done).    Can these bubbleheads ever pass the Academy? They have made 7 films.    DVD includes a 30-minute featurette, \\"Behind Acadmey Doors: Secret Files Revealed\\"., theatrical trailer and audio commentary for this 20th Anniversary edition.    Runs: 1:46.    The next film in the series: Police Academy 2--Their First Assignment (1985).
B000007S5B|5.0|I agree with most people that this album is not one of the Doors top three albums, but that doesn't mean it's not a great album. It's much more mellow then self-titled or Strange Days including several slow ballads. It's also one the most trippy albums I've ever heard. I reeally do put it up there with Pink Floyd's A Piper at the gates of Dawn as far as psychedelia goes.  <br /> <br />1. Hello I Love You (5/5) The hit song off the album. Very poppy as far as a Doors song goes. Still a rock classic that will get stuck in your head all day <br /> <br />2. Love Street (5/5) A slow lovely ballad. I really enjoy this song and its my favorite of all the slower paced doors songs. Ultimate chilling song <br /> <br />3. Not to Touch the Earth (5/5) The trippiness begins. this song is insane <br /> <br />4. Summertime's Almost Gone (3/5) Nothing Special for Doors standards. I hate when the summers over. <br /> <br />5. Wintertime Love (4/5) lil better then the summer one. some nice organ work here <br /> <br />6. The Unknown Soldier (5/5) This song is awesome. Super trippy and multi parted. anitwar lyrics <br /> <br />7. Spanish Caravan (5/5) Sweet...as good as #6 <br /> <br />8. My Wild Love (2/5) Acapella like song...crazy noise goin on in the background  <br /> <br />9. We Could Be So Good Together (4/5) Nice song....awesome guitar solo <br /> <br />10. Yes, The River Knows (4/5) The second best ballad on the album <br /> <br />11. Five To One (5/5) Amazing song. so menacing yet so catchy. Robby's guitar solo is just straight wicked. also some great organ work in this one too <br /> <br />If you're a Doors fan you will most certainly enjoy this. But if you're just a casual listener you prolly won't enjoy this as much as their self-titled album.
6304981635|5.0|This was the last movie Lee completed before his untimely death. Although filmed in Hong Kong, it was the first major kung fu movie done by a Hollywood production company, and became the archetype for literally hundreds of other movies in the chop-socky genre that followed it, and paved the way for the other martial arts franchises by Stephen Segal, van Damme, and others. I've also read it was the only one of Lee's films that used his real voice, rather than being dubbed.<br /><br />Lee, John Saxon, and Jim Kelly star as the intrepid threesome of fighters who travel to the evil Han's island stronghold to participate in his annual martial arts tournament. With supporting martial artists such as Bob Wall, the redoubtable Bolo Yeung (who always deserved to be more famous than he became) the movie sports plenty of great fight scenes where Lee literally takes on dozens of assailants as well as the duels during the official martial arts competition. Lee is of course unbeatable as well as his comrades.<br /><br />Filmed in 1973, the radical 60s weren't yet a distant memory, and the movie benefits from that progressive influence and ambience in that we have a Chinese, white, and a black man fighting side by side as if that's the most natural thing in the world as they go around showing their martial arts mettle at the tournament, or trouncing Han's bad guys in the final big melee at the end of the movie. The multi-ethnic team of martial arts brothers is unbeatable and unstoppable and Han's bad guys are no match for their courage and skill.<br /><br />The movie had the most elaborately choreographed fight scenes ever attempted up till that time, and it wasn't uncommon for the actors to rehearse for 12 hours to get a couple of minutes of actual movie footage. If you consider all the actual action scene time in the move, you can see how much work all the fighers and actors must have put in.<br /><br />The plot is a campy fusion of James Bond and chop-socky. Lee plays a British agent who's trying to get the goods on the evil Han, using the tournament as his cover during the day. But at night, he's prowling around Han's base and beating the crap out of his guards and lackeys as he searches for evidence to incriminate Han. But if you're like me, the actual story was just filler, with the real fun being getting to watch all these great martial artists, many of whom were still in their prime, show their stuff.oods on the evil Han, using the tournament as his cover during the day.

B0006399FS|3.0|The lyrics are clear; the music is well-played, but much of the album doesn't feel essential. That's the problem with this album. It's simply another U2 album.  <br /> <br />How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is a shiny, well-polished album, but it's not an absorbing one - and given this band's long history of compelling music, that's a shame. It's the sound of a band not playing to their strengths, and taking no risks.  <br /> <br />We can't live without their brilliant statements as Joshua Tree, War, Achtung Baby or Pop, but we can live perfectly well without this one. This album is just useless. It's a minor work by a major group
0385510454|4.0|I've found John Grisham to be uneven. Sometimes he is a fun read; sometimes I just give up and move on.<br /><br />  In \\"The Broker,\\" Grisham is near the top of his form.<br /><br />  In a tale filled with sleazy characters, Joel Backman is no better or worse than the President of the United States who, at the urging of his corrupt advisor, pardons Backman. Backman is a guest of the government, sitting in solitary with years to run on his sentence. Suddenly he is offered a deal he can't refuse: walk out of prison a free man, but he has to leave the country and assume a new identity.<br /><br />  The reality is that the Director of the CIA wants to see who is the first to reach and murder Backman.<br /><br />  Backman is not dumb and his machinations provide the fuel that drive the story.<br /><br />  This is not classic literature, but it is an enjoyable way to pass a few leisure hours.<br /><br />Jerry
B0007TKNL0|1.0|I hated this movie from the terrible beginning to the just as terrible end. There was only one good song throughout the entire thing. There was a love story, but this girl kissed the Phantom, then got with this guy, then kissed the Phantom again. This movie should never had been made. It was a total waste of time. I only wish they had a zero option for stars.
B00066R4S4|5.0|I judged this book by its cover.  The pink made me pick it up off the shelf, the first page had me hooked.  I took it with me for a weekend at the beach and I could not stop laughing.  I can definately see this book as a movie one day.  It was a great relief from my life as a mom with three kids (twins age one).  <br /> <br />I don't want to give the story away, just read it! Prepare to laugh! <br /> <br />It reminded me of Bridget Jones Diary type of story.  If you liked that book/movie you will like this.  And even if you didn't (I personally was not that impressed with the movie) you will still love this.
B00001OH7N|5.0|Being a Bowie fan for quite a while now,I aquired this album as part of my exploration. <br />This album is absolutely awesome.Call it psychedelic,call it hard rock,call it blues,country,folk. <br />All songs has the typical Bowie quirkyness that can be witnessed on any of his albums.\\"All the madmen\\" is a simply awesome song,progressive rock with awesome lyrics. <br />Black Country rock is a simple rock ballad,but it's simplicity is it's excellence,it will stick in your head.Every song has something that appeals to me.Even if Bowie has a average moment,you don't pick it up,everything seems masterly. <br />If you are buying an album to discover Bowie's music, this one might not be ideal,but it is a must have for any loyal fan,a critical part of the Bowie saga.
B0007CNXUK|4.0|At the beginning of \\"Finding Neverland\\", struggling playwright J.M. Barrie (Depp) is in a rut, as he has been creating uninspiring and boring plays. The film suggests he tried to write to his audience, rather than remaining true to his own worldview and letting everyone see his unique form of genius. Barrie discovers the secret to unlocking his brilliance when he develops a deep platonic love for a widow and her four young boys and draws on them as his muse. From his time with the fatherless family, the world is given the play \\"Peter Pan\\".  <br /> <br />Although Barrie develops a powerful and strangely non-sexual love for the mother of the boys (Kate Winslet), it is his relationship with her children that touches his heart and opens a path toward emotions he has repressed for years. Seeing the innocence in them reminds Barrie of a simpler time in his life when dreams came true and magic lurked around every corner.  <br /> <br />He immerses himself in their lives, inventing imagination outlets for the boys and driving them to believe in dreams and wonder. What Barrie feels for the children is hard to explain (and in today's time would be viewed with a few raised eyebrows). He develops the kind of pure, unconditional love that convinces others it must be tainted in some way. No man can love a stranger's four boys so much.  <br /> <br />Like \\"Shakespeare in Love\\", the audience gets to see how real life events become iconic moments from literature. The film's lasting images include beautiful dissolves from reality to imagination, as Barrie's mind alters and sculpts experiences to fit his play. One unforgettable image begins with the four boys jumping on their beds and (in Barrie's mind) becomes the famous scene from \\"Peter Pan\\" where the children float out of their bedroom.  <br /> <br />While the film makes important declarations as to the power of wide-eyed youthful imagination and challenges viewers to recapture the wonder of childhood, it at times becomes laboriousto watch. The only real conflict in the film is painfully artificial and clichd (disapproval from Barrie's wife and the boys' grandmother). Indeed, it is an inspirational and magical film, but it just seems to be lacking a little something extra to make it great.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|\\"is This It\\" was fresh revival of rock n roll in a period where music was becoming lame. This album is boring and very ordinary. Perhaps the strokes managed to kick off some steam so that other bands like the Hives, the White stripes, Franz Ferdinand and the like could follow in this direction but in the end I think that all that will be left of the Strokes in 5 to 10 years time will be one small date in the music history. <br /> <br />
B0000CFW87|5.0|Though Josh Groban is not to be compared to anyone else, as his voice is unique and refreshing, I can say that I would definitely rate him among the best of all time. This young man's ability to perfect songs in four languages is far beyond anything ordinary. The CD is a must for generations to come. He takes us back to what music should be, a wonderful and therapeutic indulgence.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver was a very interesting read. The beginning of the book starts off very slow, introducing the characters. Eventually, you realize that everything is the same. There is not a bit of that thing we now call individuality. There are no feelings of any kind, no pain, happiness, or even hunger...Then this one boy had been chosen to be the receiver. This job is filled with pain and suffering. He has to take all the memories from the Giver, memoeries of times when there was love, hate, pain, suffering, and happiness. Jonas, who is the main character, starts trying to use these new feelings that he has acquired through the Giver and wants to apply them to his life of `Sameness'. It does not work though, because the people have npt experienced what he has felt since becoming the receiver. <br /> <br /> Overall I give the book a b+. The ending was very good, and made the book enjoyable to read.  <br />
B00006LLNV|4.0|Goldenthal's compilation has lots of integrity & authenticity behind it (unlike Taco Bell or El Torito), and you can see Goldenthal's genuine passion for Mexican music in the DVD's interview.  Kudos to Salma Hayek...who new she could sing?  Also, I am very glad they incorporated \\"La Bruja\\" which is one of the most interesting, enigmatic, provocative & under-recorded of the Son Jarocho songs. <br /> <br />A couple of quick notes...the \\"Young Kid\\" reviewer below...I don't mean to be a prick but Salma is not from Coyoacan (one of the most exclusive neighborhoods in Mexico City), she is from Veracruz; and your Spanish grammar is quite poor...so you are probably not from Coyoacan either.   <br /> <br />Second, if you like this album you should definitely try the more polished effort by Samuel Zyman (one Mexico's five leading contemporary composers)& Jorge Reyes (arguably Mexico's leader in the revival of Pre-Hispanic music & a talented composer of Free Music in his own right) written for the 1998 movie \\"La Otra Conquista\\"

6305311463|5.0|I cannot believe all the negative feedback ARMEGEDDON has recieved.  Why, it is one of the most greatest action films ever made, and it is brought to us by action director Michael Bay (He is my favorite movie director).  I have liked this movie even before I knew he directed it.  I rememeber seeing this in theaters when I was ten years old back in 1998, and it put me on the edge of my seat.  It had such great special effects, alot of intense action scenes, some great comedical moments, and even some very emotionl parts at the end of the of the film.  Yes, I know it was a very long movie, but the movie will make such an impact on you that you'll never notice.  It is ALOT better then that other sappy disaster movie, DEEP IMPACT.  DEEP IMPACT was more of an emotional movie while ARMAGEDDON is more of an action thrill ride.  Although most people prefer DEEP IMPACT, I would rather would watch this.  Here is the plot. <br />When a space shuttle and half of New York city is unexpectantly destroyed by a meteor shower, NASA tracks down another cosmical object heading toward for us.  The difference, is that this one is enormous, it the size of Texas.  And to make matters worse, we only have 18 days to destroy it-BEFORE IT DESTROYS US!  Now, the only was to demolishing it is by planting a nuclear weapon 800 feat below it surface.  In order to do that, NASA must get the Worlds best deep core driller.  That guy is Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his crew AJ (Ben Affleck), \\"Chick\\" Chappelle (Will Patton), Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan), Max (Kan Campbell), Oscar (Owen Wilson), Freddy Noonan (Clark Bolly), and Rockhound (Steve Buscemi).  These have 12 days to train how to become astronauts.  All the time in the world is all they've got. <br />In my opinin, I think this is the best movie directed by Michael Bay.  Its has all sorts of great elements- Action, comedy, and drama.  Sure the plot is a little obscure, our fate is in the hands of a bunch of oil drillers?  I know it sounds dumb, but it does make a great pop corn flick.  What was also good about this movie was the relation ship between AJ and Harry's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler).  Besides the asteroid, the movie was also centered around that relationship.  AJ and Grace love each other however Harry does not like AJ.  Loving Grace was sort of the real reason why AJ was saving the World.  He is doing for her.  And slowly throughout the movie, AJ was earning Harry's respect. <br />Now let me talk about this DVD.  I suggest getting the regular edition DVD, not the criterion collection.  I remeber paying alot of money for the criterion collection, and while the movie is fantastic, the dvd lacks even though is is a 2 disc set.  Every piece of veiwing material on the 2nd disc is only ten minutes.  I can probobly watch everything on the second disc in less then 45 min.  It surely was not worth the 30 plus dollars, I suggest getting the regular single disc edition.  It won't have as much x-tras, but it will be a better buy.
B00007K02F|5.0|Having read this book numerous times and having seen three film versions of this classic, I have to say that William Hurt is exactly what the author would have intended for Mr. Rochester.  I also like the Orson Welles' and Ciaran Hinds' performances, this review is not meant to reflect poorly on their skills; however,  I believe that William Hurt not only read this classic, but also studied it.  A special thank you to him for doing so - it is extremely important to treat masterpieces with such care.  He was the perfect choice for this movie.  If I were going to say anything bad about this film, I would have to say that the performances of the other actors seem to be a struggle in comparison to that of Mr. Hurt.  They still did a fine job, but he did such a superb job that it seems the others are all reaching somewhat.  But I still believe this was well-cast, and I am looking forward to watching it several more times.
B0007GADZO|4.0|I really like SV.  His music is fun and always gives me a laugh when I watch, see or listen to his solo's.<br /><br />I tend to like the strangeness of the Zappa influenced work.  I tend to agree with the other reveiwer who wrote that there are '2 Steve Vai's' but there is a lot to enjoy in this CD... and I think there are plenty of hooks, esspecially in the opening track.<br /><br />Hooks are nice for songs, and I love a good hook as much as anyone else, but I give SV a boost on this recording because he is bravely going where not to many go... and lets face it... songs are mostly now built around plastic hook on plastic sounding hook... it is true that SV is more meat than hook but good meat is good meat.<br /><br />I give it 4 stars, since I have other SV's that I like better..<br /><br />But there is still nothing wrong with music that is not pop fluff.
B00003CX9Q|3.0|I would urge anyone buying this DVD to please watch the original, unaltered version first. The idea of \\"updating\\" older films by inserting computer graphics at the director's whim 20 years later is laughable...I actually threw out the disc containing the \\"2002 version\\" (blech), and got this solely for the nicely remastered 1982 version.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|I took my children to see Finding Neverland yesterday and today I can't wait for it to be released on Video.   <br /> <br />I expected Johnny Depp to be wonderul (he is), Kate Winslet to be beautiful and fabulous (she is) and the story to be winning (it is).  But I don't think I expected to be as moved by this beautiful story as I was.  There's just something about it--an aching beauty, I think I'd call it--that epitomizes the poignancy of childhood, love, and the human ability to dream that almost goes beyond the power of words to describe it.  It walks the edge of the precipice of innocence/experience in a watercolor balancing act that is as delicate and yet as durable and neverending as the circle of life itself.  I fell in love with every aspect.
B0002VEPRQ|3.0|This review is on the 40th anniversary DVD, not the film itself - actually this is more of a warning than a review. Please, avoid the \\"enhanced home theater mix\\" at all costs. It is a distasteful remix of the original soundtrack that seems to be a misguided attempt to update the film to have a more \\"noisy\\" and \\"modern\\" feel. The excessive bass is especially inappropriate. The original theatrical mix is clear, magical and engrossing, and was actually nominated for an Academy award. The fact that it is not the default option on this disc is an insult to the people who created the original sound mix.
B00005JMJG|2.0|This supposedly clever film telegraphs the ending (or the \\"almost ending\\") very quickly; but even that doesn't matter too much because it doesn't take too long before you really don't care too much what happens to these pathetic characters anyway... <br /> <br />It's too bad, too, because as usual Jim Carry does a fabulous job with what he's given to work with--It's just his continual bad judgement of scripts that pre-ordains his best efforts to be condemned to obscurity.  The character of Joel is stunningly acted, unfortunately...he's totally uninteresting. <br /> <br />As is the Character of Clementine...I will NEVER understand why blue hair (the only attribute of this one-dimensional character) was enough to garner Kate Winslet an Oscar nomination when she was absolutely astounding in FINDING NEVERLAND. <br /> <br />The supporting cast is also utterly wasted.  WHY the likes of Kirsten Dunst and Elijah Wood are even there is a total mystery.  They don't seem to have much to do aside from display stupidity and (in the case of Kirsten) strip off clothing in an attempt to keep the audience awake and connected.  <br /> <br />The speculatory plot about the nature of memory, fate, love and space/time is so vapid that I couldn't even conjure up a yawn.  We endure this train wreck to, in the end, find out...guess what?  That if we are realistic in our expectations to begin with, relationships will last longer and the people involved will be happier.  Profound...***SNORE*** <br /> <br />The best part of this film...????  The fact that it's NOT a full two hours long.  <br /> <br />
B0006A9FMI|1.0|This is a marvelous film that is ruined by what appears to be a stuck Closed Caption feature.  I was going to return it until I read the other reviews.  I guess I have to assume that Dreamworks intended you to read \\"[helicopter blades rotating]\\" or \\"[light sounding footsteps]\\"  including the brackets/brackets closed.  Is this defective?  Buyer beware!!!!!!!!!
B000002JSZ|3.0|This album came right after 1981's For Those About To Rock. <br />They did a really good job in trying to recapture the raw sound of the early Bon Scott albums (LET THERE BE ROCK,HIGH VOLTAGE).The truth is that most of these songs sound the same.This is the stage when they were beginning to sound repetitive a bit(or at least that's how they sounds in my ears) but the guitar playing is excellent as always.The standouts on the record are NERVOUS SHAKEDOWN,BEDLAM IN BELGIUM and GUNS FOR HIRE..An AC/DC DIE HARD FAN who would consider this a 5 star album.It's nowhere near BACK IN BLACK and HIGHWAY TO HELL.It's a really good raw rock record.If you wanna buy something from AC/DC start with BACK IN BLACK or HIGHWAY TO HELL.Not one of their best or one mentioned in conversations on their discography but certainly one of the enjoyable ones on their canon.ROCK IT!
B0000CDL93|4.0|The Warren Report is the basic starting point for anybody who is even remotely interested in researching the JFK assassination. The book is massive - nearly 2 inches thick, 9 inches in length and 6 inches in width and clocks in at 888 pages. There are many illustrations and photographs to help break the monotony and they are helpful in understanding the text.<br /><br />Be forewarned. This report is not to be taken at face value. It promotes itself while at the same time laying blame on everybody from Oswald to the Secret Service and the Dallas County Police. The movie JFK is critical of this book's findings, because of its omissions. This is what the movie JFK hopes to explore.<br /><br />The warren commission report starts with its summary and conclusions - that Oswald acted alone in killing President Kennedy and that there was no conspiracy. It then gives a brief synopsis of the assassination and the circumstances surrounding the events on November 22nd 1963. We see these in the movie. The report continues by developing the scenario in the Texas School Book Depository including the evidence gained from witnesses at the scene and the recovery of the riffle, spent shells and prints. Connections are established between Oswald and the riffle and the School Book Depository building before moving on to the motive and Oswald's background, Oswald's detention, the media, Oswald's murder and his assassin - Jack Ruby. The film is mostly about dealing with investigating a possible conspiracy, challenging the Warren report in-depth with expert witness testimony, with the big court room showdown that in the end leaves you feeling that Oswald did not do it.<br /><br />Great movie, through and through. Hard not to love it. Why only 4 stars?<br /><br />Oswald was involved in the slaying of Officer J.D Tippit and this is a clincher. The murder of patrolman Tippit is a key event which shows that Oswald was capable of murder and was also on a killing frenzy at the time of the assassination. The movie really does bend the reality of this problem by saying that it was a number of agents pretending to be Oswald.<br /><br />He also tried to shoot officers when he was apprehended in the film theatre. Did Oswald shoot President Kennedy? Probably Yes. Could the Magic bullet theory work? It is possible. Did Jack Ruby kill Oswald on the spur of the moment? The facts surrounding this are vague. Did Oswald act alone? It is possible but unlikely. Does the Warren report do justice for the American people and the people of the world? Absolutely not. Does the Warren report deliberately neglect important and relevant information? Absolutely. Would an impartial jury convict Oswald on the assassination of President Kennedy based on the evidence? Probably not because there is too much doubt at large to deal with. Would an impartial jury convict Oswald of the murder J.D Tippit? Yes. Is there a cover-up and if so why?<br /><br />The truth is that there is probably a cover-up involved and the Warren report as it stands today is absolute proof that the US government at the time was knee-deep in a conspiracy of some kind simply based on its omissions and neglect to deal with highly important and relevant evidence. Was there a government conspiracy to assassinate the President? Probably not, but there was a cover-up of a conspiracy of some kind and this is what is at the heart of the whole assassination and the follow up events including this report. A blind eye has probably been turned to the truth surrounding the assassination because President Kennedy was considered an obstacle to many important people. In fact the Warren Commission report has all the hallmarks of a new administration that just wants to sweep everything under the carpet.<br /><br />But in closing I will say this. Go try the real world simulation run of  JFKreloaded and you will see that it might be possible to actually reproduce the magic bullet. You can actually hit the President 3 times no problem, including the fatal headshot. Oswald could have done it. The simulation clearly shows that you can do it also.imes no problem, including the fatal headshot. Oswald could have done it. The simulation clearly shows that you can do it also.

B000092Q4U|5.0|Lamb of God's \\"As The Palaces Burn\\" is one of the bets CDs released in 2003. Randy Blythe is one of my favorite metal vocalists, and everyone else in the band is talented. The guitars kick ass, and sound incredible blended in with Blythe's vocals. Pick this CD up along with the other two Lamb of God titles out: New American Gospel and Ashes of The Wake.
B0007GADZO|3.0|I think that when you are a genius such as Mr Vai. There probably gets to be a point where you feel you can do anything. Will someone please tell him that he should not and can not sing. This also ruined the last Kenny Wayne Sheppard record. I can't agree more that with the reviewer who said there are 2 Steve Vai's. One that writes songs that you can not hear enough, and telling your friends \\"listen to this song\\". And then there is one who's songs are so \\"goofy\\" for lack of a better word, you are hoping to get to the CD player before your friend hear it and think you are listening to something that was made for a kindergarten class. The man is a genius, and I will continue to buy his product and go to his shows, but sometimes a genius becomes so mad that he starts to turn his followers off. Be careful Steve you a getting closer to that point. First song is great, seventh track is great (and mellow as are all 7th tracks on Vai's albums). The rest is highly suspect and a little annoying at times. 3 stars because he is Vai. (Just came back from first live show in Tempe, great show Billy was amazing, no singing and not a lot of material from the new album.)
B00005JNVS|5.0|Stephen Chow's follow-up to 'Shaolin Soccer' (which was virtually killed in US market) is totally different from 'Shaolin.'  'Kung-hu' is a comedy, sure it is, but the star/director Chow takes this martial arts very seriously, and the film itself gives more emphasis upon martial arts actions (including silly ones) than the parodies or sight gags.  And look, the film is credited with TWO choreographers -- Sammo Hung and Yuen Wo Ping! <br /> <br />[THE STORY] is set in pre-Revolutiona China.  The city is ruled by ruthless mobsters 'Axe Gang,' and now remember, they are really ruthless.  Even though they dance like 'Cotton Club'-Meets-'Gangs of New York' style.  And of course, they wield axes while dancing in the street. <br /> <br />Then our hero Sing (Chow) enters.  He wants to join in the 'Axe Gangs,' and to prove his 'ability' as gangster (whatever it is), he tries to extort money from the locals living in the 'Pig Sty Alley.'  What he didn't know was, the people are much, much more strong and resourceful than he expected. <br /> <br />The plot may sound rather pointless, and in fact it is.  In short, it is about two wannabe gangsters, and the fights between gangsters and the residents of the 'Alley.'  You see several references to other films, but the film's greatest merit is not them.  It is kung-hu action. <br /> <br />[ACTIONS] For Stephen Chow shows unexpectedly exciting fight sequences between the unique characters -- assassins who use musical instruments like invisible swords (and this scene is very violent), the tailor and cook who fight like devil, the Landlord and Landlady, and The Beast ... yes, he fight like a beast, or a toad (literally).   <br /> <br />[THE STAR] Stephen Chow as hero Sing displays considerable martial arts skills, especially in the finaly act which goes like the climax of 'Matrix Revolutions' -- and Chow is better than Keanu! -- but it is the extraordinary supporting actors that really are rivetting.  The hen-pecked landlord by Yuen Wah (known as 'magnificient villain' in Hong Kong films) and his chain-smoking wife landlady by Yuen Qiu (coming back to screen after almost 30 years) are real scene stealer, always surprising us with their outrageous personalities.  And wait for 'The Beast' by Leung Siu Lung (himself a major Kung-hu star during the 70s, and comes back to movie after 15 year hietus) whose initial appearance as a bald and plump middle-aged is very deceptive.  And look for Yeun Cheung-Yan (as a suspicious-looking seller of 'kung-hu manuals'), brother to Yuen Woo Ping and action choreographer of 'Charlie's Angles.' <br /> <br />The film may not as funny (and silly) as 'Shaolin Soccer' and if so, that's because Stephen Chow really respects the art of kung-hu and its masters.  It is still a comedy, and it is often funny, but perhaps you should see it as an action film -- with ridiculously exaggerated fight styles based on the traditional kung-hu.  So, my advice: Don't think, just feel, and enjoy yourself.
B000000OE7|4.0|First of all, this review is not a \\"Freddie Mercury Lifetime Achievement Award.\\"  Though this album may have tracks from different years and took 3 years after the Concert for Life in 1992, as a whole, it sounds more cohesive than Hot Space.  With the exception of the 2 bonus tracks (particularly the never ending 20+ minute instrumental) and \\"You Don't Fool Me\\" which sounds like another \\"Don't Lose Your Head\\" rewrite, most of the songs are top notch.  That's why I gave this review 4 stars, thank you.  Brian, Roger and John added their musical and production touches to make this album sound as relevant as anything which was big in 1995.  \\"It's a Beautiful Day (both parts)\\" sound like Freddie is enjoying every minute, not worried when his time is coming (the 1st part sounds warm and placid, the 2nd part features snippets of \\"7 Seas of Rhye\\" and \\"Mustapha\\" thrown into the mix).  \\"Mother Love\\" is one of the saddest songs Queen ever recorded, made even more depressing by the fact that this was the last song Freddie recorded (Brian sang the last verse as Freddie was too ill to finish).  \\"My Life Has Been Saved\\" cheers things up a bit (originally the B-side to \\"Scandal.\\"  \\"Heaven for Everyone\\" is from the Cross, a Roger Taylor project and \\"I Was Born to Love You\\" is originally from Freddie Mercury's Mr. Bad Guy album.  Now for the best songs: \\"Made In Heaven\\" is a power ballad, with the typically atypical chord changes the classic Queen was known for.  This version of \\"Too Much Love Will Kill You\\" sounds even better than the one on Brian May's solo Back to the Light, with Freddie Mercury singing lead.  \\"Let Me Live\\" features Freddie, Brian and Roger each on lead (apparently, the idea of all 3 of them singing was Freddie's idea back when he was still alive).  It's almost reminiscent of the Beatles' mix on \\"Free as a Bird,\\" which came out the same year and Queen's own \\"Play the Game.\\"  The introspective and poignant \\"A Winter's Tale\\" is featured near the close the album, asthe last song Freddie wrote (it was also featured near the end of a documentary Champions of the World).  Those of you who prefer the Queen of the 1970's may not like it as much as their older music but Made In Heaven remains an appropriate tribute to the late great Freddie Mercury.
B000002N2N|5.0|This CD provides an unlikely source to help me bond with my two young children when I drive them places.  With the CD player blaring away, my two year old daughter will sing \\"Go go go\\" and \\"Whoa-oh-oh\\" and other snippets of the lyrics, and my four year old son with autism will crack a smile, which is pretty expressive for him.  Simple chord progressions, repetitive lyrics, and energetic singing is pretty typical in childrens music, and this works for my kids. Yes, some people might claim this is about the maturity level of this band.  Daddy bouncing up and down in the drivers seat probably helps the kids get into to it. <br /> <br />Why does Daddy like this CD?  It's just pure rock and roll energy.  There's barely a pause between songs and the band is in top form.  They express a real joy with mindless songs like \\"Surfin' Bird\\".  There's probably nothing that's been said about the Ramones that I could add here, and most people's opinion of the band is firmly made up, but this CD is a great value for anyone in the \\"like/love/worship the Ramones\\" camp. <br /> <br />ONE TWO THREE FOUR!!!!

B0002S94OS|5.0|Ashes of The Wake is the best metal album released in 2004 along with Cradle of Filth's Nymphetamine. Standout tracks include \\"Laid To Rest\\", \\"Hourglass\\", \\"The Faded Line\\", and \\"Break You\\". The CD's instrumental title track \\"Ashes of The Wake\\" is also decent. Every song on this CD is good. Pick this up along with Lamb of God's other two albums: New American Gospel and As The Palaces Burn.
B00009W0U4|3.0|the beginning(or the end)is as violent as any scene in saving private ryan.man,thats one club no human should ever be caught in.this is the simple yet ultra twisted story of a night out among friends.only this night is told in reverse-the payoff happening almost immediately and then allowing the viewers to recover from the 1st twenty minutes.its incredible to see how an ordinary day ends in the pit of hell.the bulk of the plot is a boyfriend trying to locate his missing girlfriend(theres more to it but i dont want to be the one to spoil it for you).hes accompanied by his best friend.as i stated before,this is told in reverse(and very well told at that)and you know how it all ends.even though the end is the beginning and most of the shock and awe happens within those 20 minutes,theres still moments that should be viewed and not explained(that much publicized rape scene).this is a rare movie where the hype of this movie is pretty much accurate.everything youve either heard or read about is true.this is not for the faint of heart,definitely not for the kids and one shouldnt be on any form of medication.the price is right,the movie is good,what more could you want?
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Some reviewers take this movie entirely too seriously.  It wasn't meant to be a Sci-Fi Classic; it was as much spoof as it was anything else. <br /> <br />After all, just how far can you fly in a P-51 without refueling?  C'mon! <br /> <br />Ok. Different strokes for different folks.  Suspend your disbelief and enjoy! <br /> <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|I adored this movie.  I cried till my face was red and puffy.  I cried till I could barely breathe.  Some because it was sad, but for a lot of it, because it was beautiful.  Some of the romance is over the top, but it gets you right to your core.  A little predictable, but if you're looking for a good movie that is free from the Hollywood drama, this is it.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I went to see the film 18 times at the cinema, therefore should  probably have been commited, however, when you loose yourself in the music and the passion of it all, once will never be enough.

B0006399FS|1.0|We were passed over by U2. They sold out and they're happy for that. We were promised a great raw 'back to our roots' album. What did we find? All That You Can't Leave Behind 2. Are we happy for that? Of course NO!. This plastic album on the whole falls in the same bin as everything the group has released since All That You Can't Leave Behind.  <br /> <br />We want something new again, no more of the same thing. We are sick of All That You Can't Leave Behind. HTDAAB is apparently even more loaded down with pop stylings than their last one, and started to fall off the charts fairly quickly.  <br /> <br />Do you want us to love their most lethargic and tuneless record ever, just because it's their lastest album? We're fans, but we aren't lambs.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I first saw the play at Her Majesty's Theater in London and then about 12 more times in the United States, mostly in New York and in Washington, DC.  Obviously, I love this great play and especially its fantastic music!!!  To my great pleasure, the movie is better, by far!  The movie explains everything and shows so much more than the play ever could.  All of the glorious music is exactly the same, but every single scene in the movie is far better than the play.  Treat yourself to one of the greatest stories and music scores ever to hit the theater, and now the big screen!  Buy this timeless classic and you can own it forever, to watch over and over for a lifetime of enjoyment.  It is by far the very best there is!  Enjoy!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I must admit, I was a bit hestitant about seeing this film.  I have never had the pleasure of seeing the musical and had only heard a few of the songs featured in the film on cd, as sung by Michael Crawford and Sarah Brightman. So, really I didn't have much to compare this film to. What surprise lay in store for me! I was absolutely mesmerized by every bit of the film. I could not take my eyes away from the screen for one moment. I think the roles were brilliantly cast, the music and songs beautifully composed and performed, and the story in itself was just magical. I found myself laughing at Carlotta (who was perfectly played by Minnie Driver), feeling Christine's infatuation with the Phantom, Raoul's love for Christine, and last but by no means least, The Phantom's yearning and love for Christine. The moment he began to cry, I too felt as if my heart was breaking. It was if the movie was drawing you into their world at that exact place and time. Saying Andrew Lloyd Webber is a genius does not do him justice. I hope to see the musical version one day but, for now, the movie version will do. It's amazing how many people have seen the movie at least three times. In fact, I met two wonderful ladies at my fourth viewing (their sixth and seventh time) and feel that I have made two new lifetime friends. No matter what the critics say, this movie has been enjoyed by so many people. I think it is because alot of people can identify with one or more of the characters in some way. Maybe some were just curious and wanted to compare it to the real thing. Maybe some were just hopeless romantics, like myself, and love a good love story. Whatever the reason(s), I believe the viewers have proved the critics wrong. I urge people to see it as many times as possible while it is in theatres and then purchase the dvd. I believe this movie will be a classic.
B00005J6T1|5.0|The Pop Stars as Madonna are 'one in a million'. Just tell me, how many pop singers can always release albums that quickly become chart-hits in more than 20 years?. <br /> <br />We know, Pop Music is so energic, happy and fresh, but how many pop albums can keep the freshness  across the time? Definitely, Madonna has done it. <br /> <br />The first one on her long discography, in my opinion is her best. Not for the lyrical quality, or the 'musical richness' in itself. <br /> <br />The Madonna's 1983 album is important because, i think is the perfect model for a pop album. Why?, let my explain. <br /> <br />1- Every song is great (personally i just skip 'I Know It'), the music beats are mixed with the vocals to rich each other. <br /> <br />2- The lyrics doesn't talk in a deep 'scratch-your-head' level, but respect our mind (Not garbage as the BSB Or Britney lyrical stuff). <br /> <br />3- The great charmness and beauty of Madonna fill the voice's void that could have the vocals (Now a day, Madonna has reached a great vocal level). <br /> <br />4- Most of the album is filled with great hits (is constant track by track, the point that the MJ's Thriller didn't reach). <br /> <br />5- The album is now-a day still playful and fresh, even many new-pop radio stations play the singles Holiday, Lucky Star and Borderline. <br /> <br />6- The Remaster has given 'new life' at the original CD release (more than 10 years ago). The sound is pretty clear and the transfer looks so well with any conventional cd-player (a perfect meaning of a Remaster in stereo). <br /> <br />Depite of that, just think this one is a very enyoy-full dance album. with a very good 80s sound, minimal dance armonies mixed up with Synth-Pop (Thinking about it, this one is better than many Synth-pop New Wave albums like the Soft Cell works). <br /> <br />In other words, this a perfect pop album <br /> <br />Just push play and enjoy 'Holiday' (the complete 6 minutes version) over and over...
B0006OBPTA|5.0|The Karate Kid movies are the defining moments of a great era -- the 1980s. The first movie is definitely the best one, in all regards. A great script, solid direction, and memorable performances make the movie the best in the series. Plus, the score is extremely inspiring and moving, throughout the entire film. In my opinion, the actor who steals the movie is William Zabka, who plays Johnny Lawrence. There's a really funny humor article that interviews Johnny Lawrence to see what he's doing these days. You can read that here: [...] Anyway, I definitely recommend these movies to anybody. This is a great collection.
1400031354|5.0|\\"Tears of the Giraffe,\\" is the second novel in Alexander McCall Smith's absolutely delightful \\"Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency\\" series. Although the primary setting is Gaborone, Botswana, the author take the reader along with Private Eye Precious Ramotswe when she travels throughout her beautiful, but desolate native countryside. Mma. Ramotswe, our plus-sized protagonist, who possesses an overabundance of intelligence, intuition, cleverness and a wonderful sense of humor, is presently busy juggling her personal life with her ever increasing success as a detective.<br /><br />She is now officially engaged to local master mechanic Mr. J.L.B. Matekoni, the most gentlemanly of men. While Mma. Ramotswe  presides over her detective agency, and is, in fact, the only female private detective in all Botswana, Mr. Matekoni has entrepreneurial expertise as well. He owns Tlokweng Road Speedy Motors. An honest, loving man with an extremely kind heart, he recently went to fix a water pump at a local orphanage, free of charge, and left with two children in tow.<br /><br />Now Mma. Ramotswe has her hands full planning a new life with her fiance and newly found family, dealing with the nasty housekeeper, and building a relationship with her foster children. She also strikes a blow for feminism when she promotes her secretary to Assistant Detective and gives her a case to solve. Then Mrs. Curtain, an American whose son disappeared in the Kalahari desert, enters the picture when she passes through  the doors of the Ladies No. 1 Detective Agency. Michael Curtain had been living and working on a commune, experimenting with systems for growing vegetables in the harsh conditions of the Botswana desert. One night, ten years before, he vanished without a trace. His mother has been searching for him ever since, exhausting every available avenue. The American Embassy recommends Mma. Ramotswe's services, as a last resort. Word does get around! Although the \\"cold case\\" does not look promising, our lady detective takes the job. I think she empathizes with the woman's pain and sense of loss, as she once lost a child of her own.<br /><br />Mma. Ramotswes spirit is luminescent. Ultimately, she is a good woman, a really decent person with a kind heart. She loves her fellow man, but most of all, and most inspiring, is her deep and abiding love for Africa, and for Botswana and its people in particular. \\"They are my people, my brothers and sisters. It is my duty to help them to solve the mysteries of their lives. That is what I am called to do.\\"<br /><br />Author Alexander McCall Smith's narrative is written simply, in a clear, uncluttered style. And our Number One Detective is both extraordinary and original - as are the people she deals with, and their everyday problems which she helps them resolve. I am captivated by Precious Ramotswe and this series. Highly recommended!<br /><br />JANAsing, our lady detective takes the job.

0007117248|5.0|This is a whimsical tale of four children who discover a magic entrance into a world where witches, talking lions, and creatures from stories are all common place. This book captivates you with the out of the ordinary events and spectacular language. Old and new fans alike will find themselves reading this over and over. Join Edmund, Peter, Lucy, and Susan on their quest to unite with Aslan, The king of beasts, in a fight to overthrow the self proclaimed queen of Narnia.
B0002JP4L4|3.0|Will there ever be another year like 1984? this film is quite entertaining about a big city kid(Kevin Bacon) as Ren McCormick, who moves with his family to a small bible-belt community, & meets oppression every where he goes, & attracts the attention of the preacher's daughter played by Lori Singer, (V's Marc Singer's sister) who is a wild child to say the least & does not share her father's conservative values, the whole film is built on the community's oppression to dancing & Rock-n-Roll, the scary part is that there are still towns like this across the country, so this film is real in that respect, but it does scream 80's, it should be noted that MTV marketed this film big time, & it was one of the first films to capitalize on a soundtrack, with Prince's \\"Purple Rain\\" following just months later in 1984, since Michael Jackson's 1983 video \\"Thriller\\", MTV & Hollywood got in bed together & saw a marketing strategy that did for a time work, this film was perfect timing & still holds up well for its story, other films such as \\"Steets of Fire\\", \\"Ghostbusters\\", \\"Beverly Hills Cop\\", T.V.\\"s \\"Miami Vice\\", all from 1984 capitalized on their movie soundtracks, MTV's videos became flashy, I don't think we will ever see another year like 1984, where movies & music became one, this one made Kevin Bacon a star & John Lithgow is very convincing as the Reverend who holds strongly to his convictions, although PG, I agree that it should have been PG-13 because of some of its content, Lori Singer's sexual antics as well as her & her boyfriend's violent breakup, but again this was released months before \\"Gremlins\\" & \\"Indiana Jones & the Temple of Doom, also in 1984 that sparked the PG-13 rating, however this should not stop one's enjoyment of the film.
B0000029GA|5.0|Had to jump aboard & 5 star one of my favourite albums of all time. I personally like all of the songs except One Time For Your Mind (It's skippable). Halftime is my favourite (Nas Drops hot lines like 'I used to hustle, now all I do is relax & strive/ when I was young I was fan of the Jackson Five'. I think halftime will always be my fave. However, it is closely followed by One Love. One Love has a nice mellow beat that goes well with Nas' stortelling, 'What up kid/ I know sh** is rough doin' your bid/ when the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib'. I could go into details on other hot lines from the album but I won't.  <br /> <br />Some people feel that one of Illmatics weaknesses is the length (10 songs). Fans should realise that the short albums are Nas' better albums because he doesn't have a 'filler' every second or third track. The Lost Tapes is a perfect example of this. Why are the lost tapes considered by many his second best album? Because it's short & sweet, no unnecessary filler tracks. I know the level of rhyming is also elevated on Illmatic compared to other albums, I just think the main reason Illmatic is a classic is because it's short & sweet.
B00006IRJU|3.0|Well, I'm a big Icehouse's fan even when I'm very young, I'm growin'up with the music of the 80s [that's the now.a.day stuff!!]. <br /> <br />This Cd has aproved the test of time, the production is pretty fine, even the lyrics are great, but COME ON, this is not the best from Icehouse. <br /> <br />I Know, I love the super-hits Crazy/Electric Blue, the songs The Kingdom and Sunrise are good and Man Of Colours (perfect song), Anybody's War(Cool Rocker), and Touch The Fire (classic)maybe are of the best of the icehouse's catalogue, but stop now!!!. <br /> <br />Most of the CD seems to be over a line with no surprises or innovations in the Icehouse sound. <br /> <br />I Remember myself playing each Icehouse album for the first time and discovering new styles, and evolution even when sometimes has been misunderstood (The underated Code Blue is in my opinion far better than this one), but Sidewalk and Man Of Colours didn't show me any surprise. <br /> <br />It's a shame, Man of Colours has been taken as the best Icehouse's album by the fans, but let's be honest, just take apart Crazy, Electric Blue and Man Of Colours (not counting the Bonus Track Touch the Fire) and we'll have a traklist of regular or bored icehouse's songs.
0316666343|3.0|I listened to the audiobook version of The Lovely Bones. I really enjoyed the book and its imaginative view of Susie's heaven. I was also absorbed with her family and how they handled her death, especially her father. Her father grieved for her while trying to remain strong, clinging to his other children, and plotting vengence on the man who murdered her. He remained focused and committed in many ways, unlike her mother who had an affair and then abandoned her family.  I enjoyed the first, three quarters of the book. <br /> <br />However, towards the end, I was disappointed with the \\"intimate\\" interaction between Ray and Ruth/Susie...It was more like a useless, delusional dream state to me...and I was also disappointed that Mr. Harvey was never really punished for his crimes. In the end, he died freakishly, but he also got away with murders for so many years.
B00005N9CV|4.0|Let me add my two cents worth to the \\"appearance-voice\\" debate. Holding someone's good looks against them is perhaps the wackiest prejudice to come down the road this century. It's so weird - Ugly=good, pretty=bad.  Sorry to disappoint the drab fans but but I love the sexy look, particularly the sultry stare out the car window on the back! Onto the review... <br /> <br />To say that I could listen to Ms. Krall sing songs like this all day is an understatement.  That throaty (that's the word!) voice is just pure gold - not crystal clear like Cheryl Bentyne or point perfect like Tierney Sutton but it still sparkles and shines.  The selections are also good, a great many ballad-like tunes (my favorite kind) with a somewhat orchestral arrangement. <br /> <br />Especially welcome were \\"The Night We Called It a Day\\", \\"Besame Mucho\\" and \\"Cry Me a River\\".  Once again, we are presented with musically perfect - but not wildly original - arrangements. And this has something to do with the four vs five stars given in my rating. I was hoping for something \\"new\\" even in the ballad category.  I love the old favorites and I am not asking for endless creation but the introduction of a few new songs would not hurt.
0743243153|5.0|This is one of those books that will change your life if you let it.  M. Scott Peck has taken years of psychotherapy experience and given us a masterpiece.  You will learn how to alter your thinking and mindset and be a better person.  It will give you new light into psychological problems of others.  I have gone on to read most of Peck's works, and they are all very good, but this is still probably the best out of all of them.<br /><br />If you like this, try \\"People of the Lie\\", or the sequel to this book, \\"Further along the Road Less Traveled\\".
B000003AEB|5.0|snoop and dre. a classic duo. unfortunate because its the best dre-couple in history. eminem and dre..well...lets not go there...its classics like this that got me into hip hop. this is an amzing album. they have the best beats. they have perfect rhyms and a perfect flow, which is something missing from modern hip hop.  <br /> <br />the album starts off with snoop and a chick in a bathtub when friends come in and crash the party. this serves as a good intro to the album because it gives you a taste of the snoop lifestyle. the album is all uphill from here. the worst song on here is doggy dogg world. doggy dogg world is an amazing song...think about what i just said...if the worst song on here is an amazing song, think about all the other songs.  <br /> <br />this music is superb. this is what old school early 90s music is all about.  <br /> <br />this is just one of many 90s classic hip hop albums. and in my oppinion, there are only about three 90s rock classics. which tells you undoubtedly that the 90s was and is all about hip hop. <br />with amazing music like this, the chronic, and all eyez on me..i wish many modern day rappers would rethink their music and create something worth 20 dollars. but as of now, modern rap sucks and early 90s rap is undeniably superb. well done dre and snoop.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Almost everyone I know has a real boner for this movie; I don't. This movie is an absolute turd. I went to see it, as it was billed as this \\"hilarious INDEPENTENT film\\". Who'se financially responsible for this cinematic sepository? MTV, and those flag-suckling jackasses at Fox. Not exactly guerrilla filmaking. <br /> <br />The MTV/Rolling Stone syndicate, as I like to call them, have decided that we're all ga-ga over this \\"80's retro revial\\" trend they created, and Napoleon Dynamite is tailor made to cash in on the craze. So, since they decide what's cool, I guess this movie is, in that respect. This is basically a John Hugues rip-off, except there's nothing endearing about it. Like most pop-culture filth, it's a pastiche of marketable icons and cliches. <br /> <br />Personally, I felt insulted by these wealth-addicted suits at MTV thinking they had a right to make a buck with yet another \\"nerd in highschool\\" movie. I think just about everyone had a hell of a time in school, and to have some corporation SELLING my own life (though I wasn't as bad as Napoleon - I hope) back to me makes me wanna take a flame-thrower to the next douchebag I see with his hair combed to the side, and too-tight thirft store threads, if you catch my drift. <br /> <br />About the only redeeming part of this movie is the car the cholos were driving. Strictly badass.
B000AP04L0|5.0|If you dig the works of creator Mike Judge, there is no reason why you should hate Office Space. This is possibly one of the greatest comedies to come out during the turn of centuries.<br /><br />Basically, the scene of this movie is in the everyday workspace, with a small cubicle and pure boredom. Peter Gibbons (Ron Livingston) is getting really tired of it, so with the help of buddy Samir and Michael Bolton (no, not the no talent assclown Michael Bolton), they basically try to do whatever it takes to screw Initech over. From Peter removing a wall from his cubicle to transmitting a virus throughout Initech's network, they want to cause their boss Bill Lumbergh (Gary Cole) trouble.<br /><br />Another important character to this movie is Milton Waddams (Stephen Root). He has had his desk moved 4 times and his red Swingline stapler taken, plus he never receives any more paychecks. When he doesn't receive any of Lumbergh's birthday cake and he is moved downstairs to storage B, he threatens to set the building on fire.<br /><br />Other important qualities to this classic movie include Peter dating waitress Joanna (Jennifer Aniston), who hates her job because she \\"doesn't wear enough flair\\", and Peter's blue-collar nextdoor apartment mate, Lawrence.<br /><br />Oh yeah, also, you have the unforgettable fax machine destruction sequence, when Michael Bolton is just furious and wants to destroy that thing. (\\"PC Load Letter? What the f**k does that mean?\\")<br /><br />Classic comedy movie. Worth your cash.
0743454537|5.0|I haven't been so caught up in a book in a long time! Jodi Picoult's premise is thought-provoking, and the various surprises (including the ending) kept me turning the pages. I loved Anna, felt sympathy for and anger with her parents (especially her mother), and was intrigued by the way the references to fire and to astronomy enhanced the story. This is a novel that I want to read again. I hope Picoult's other books are as good. MY SISTER'S KEEPER is in my top twenty of all time.
B00005V1Y0|5.0|I really like Baz Luhrmann.  He really adds some cinematic beauty to his films.  And this film especially.  Moulin Rouge and Romeo and Juliet were good and I enjoyed them, but this is one I can watch over and over again.<br /><br />The story is of a promising young Australian ballroom dancer who isn't stepping into line with conformity, which causes problems.  This seems to be a problem with any sport where they arbitrarily judge your sport (figure skating, gymnastics, etc.).  But he and his surprising dance partner overcome the obstacles and well, the rest is up to you to see.  The music is top-notch and so are the actors.  A must-see!
0671027344|5.0|This book is an amazing story, I talk about it so much that all my friends have now read it. Charlie is a truly awesome character that will stay with you forever, and I really believe that almost anyone can relate to this book.
B0006399FS|1.0|You get to hear Bono really screaming and you get the heared before sound and songwriting from ATYCLB, with 11 half-worked pieces of nothing to bookend the album. Does this sound like value for money? Hell no!. <br /> <br />If U2 showed their first sings of getting old, tired, comfortably numb and outdated with ATYCLB, that seems even more obvious with this dull copy-paste effort called HTDAAB. If you want to listen to just a 49 minute swathe of very \\"classic\\" U2 sounding keyboards and the same trademark guitar sections again and again, then this album is for you. If you want to listen to something life changing, artistic, worthy, different, mind blowing, brand new, experimental or risky, DO NOT BUY THIS!. <br /> <br />This is desperate stuff with hamfisted lyrics and very little melody. Where's the excitement? I can't believe this is a \\"U2\\" album, it's so embarrassing. Obvious song structures, ordinary songwriting, annoying vocals - Bono has no range at all, but he screaaaaams and shoooooouts with his rough smoker voice pretending to show us he is in good voice -, childish 'punk' attitude at the covert art...by the way, there's absolutely NOTHING punk on this album, moreover, this is not a Rock album. 3 Tracks ( 'Vertigo', 'Love And Peace Or Else' and 'All Because Of You' ) can be described as 'Rock', I mean, just 27% of the album. The rest ? their mid tempo cliches and silly Grammy worthy ballads. U2 never sounded so Pop, prefabricated, sellout and commercial before. This is their weakest album ever, and these reviews prove it. Their worst reviewed album ever.  <br /> <br />What a difference! while they want you to believe this is their strongest raw album ever by releasing it with a extremely stupid 'punk' cover with raw design, the album itself is sissie, predictable, cliche, tiring and boring.  <br /> <br />And the 'Rock' songs are their worst Rock numbers ever. 'Vertigo' is an annoying 3 minute iPod commercial, filled with childish lyrics and emtpy music. 'AllBecause Of You' is a terrible Rattle & Hum rip-off, a rotten mix between 'Desire' and 'All Along The Watchover'. and 'Love And Peace Or Else' is simply filler background pap. As bad as the song title. The rest of the album is just too obvious, too lacking in subtly and so commercial in intent it just hurts.  <br /> <br />U2 can retire right now with all of their money they got with their 80's and 90's worthy legacy. After all, they're alive just because of their glory past. U2 have become in rubbish predictable sellout music company, supported by equally sellout media as Rolling Stone magazine or Grammy. <br /> <br />They should have called it a day right about now <br /> <br />
B0001MDP3G|4.0|They should have called this flick \\"The English Patient Moves to the Confederacy\\" for the parallels between this movie and that other Anthony Minghella romance, \\"The English Patient\\", were so obvious in production values, script writing and direction as to make the Civil War film prequel to the World War II epic.<br /><br />This film stands on its own, of course, and is a nice tale of love, war, romance and adventure. It is full of big stars and tends to get better the longer it goes on. I thought the movie meandered quite a bit the first 80 minutes or so, then improved markedly with the appearance of Renee Zellweger's character, whose portrayal dominated every scene.<br /><br />As to the love story, well, I've seen better. As to this movie deserving the Oscar for best film, I can't go along with that either. This is a good movie by any standard. But I saw \\"Fargo\\" uncut the next night and immediately saw the difference between this good movie and a completely original and very great film.<br /><br />So enjoy \\"Cold Mountain\\" for its compelling scenes, lengthy but involving story, and Zellweger's Oscar-winning portrayal and hope that Minghellas does not next bring the Hundred Years War to the screen.
0440237688|4.0|Echoing the warnings of a not-so-distant future that have been laid before her by Bradbury, Huxley and Orwell, Lois Lowery provides a glimpse of a frightening future.  There is no burning of the books here--they are just hidden.  There is no forced mating--children are birthed, then given to a set of parents--who didn't have the ability to have the children, or even chose their spouse.  Without giving too much away, this book is a look at a future in which people do not have past memories, do not think for themselves, and live in \\"Communities\\" in which every aspect of their lives are regulated.
B00000255X|2.0|This used to be one of my fave Dylan discs, along with Blood on the Tracks and Basement Tapes. I just picked up Bootleg #5, which includes live versions of six of these tunes. Each one, especially the uptempo numbers (Hurricane, Isis, and Romance in Durango), rocks, putting the studio versions here to shame. If we had a similar, live version of Black Diamond Bay, I'd never put this disc on again.
B00005JN4H|5.0|What a pleasure, as always, to watch Queen Latifah do what she does best...entertain. This is a light-hearted, good guys/gals vs. bad guys/gals. Lots of fun for the family! Kudos.
B000002UJQ|5.0|A truly masterpiece in every way. Seems like everyone hate it after the first listening, which I may understand, as it is very complex in terms of both melodies and the use of instruments. Actually, I hated it myself. I thought it sounded noisy the first time I heard it. But I listened to it again. And again. Belive me; It really grows on you. I belive that melodies that are hard to like, also becomes hard to dislike when you first like them. It takes time before the melodies on OK Computer hooks, but when it does, they'll never get out of your head.  <br />Although the album is perfect as an album, it also works as individual songs. <br />My favoritte is Airbag. It's Probably the best song on the album, if not Radiohead's best ever. Wierd melody that really hooks when you have heard it for about 20 times, and the guitar-solo in the middle is just amazing. Inspiration from early Pink Floyd? <br /> <br /> <br />
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I first got into this band after hearing their song \\"Look What You've Done\\", and after I put the CD in and listened to the whole thing, I was definitely quite pleased with the variations in tracks I heard.  Some are great for driving to (\\"Gonna Get What You Need\\" and \\"Are You Gonna Be My Girl\\"), and others are great for simply listening to while doing work and singing along to (\\"Look What You've Done\\").  With the diverse track arrangement, you will be kept on your toes, regardless of what you are in the mood for.  There is some slight resemblance to The Strokes, true, but Jet has their own sound and pace, enough to hold up on their own.
0142004413|5.0|I usually only have time to read at night. I keep a book by my bedside and if I awaken in the middle of the night, instead of worrying, I read. This isn't the best book to use in this fashion. I have, on several occasions, awakened and thought, \\"I'll just read a few pages\\" only to find myself engulfed in oxygenated laughter that has kept me up for the duration of the night. I don't know when I've laughed out loud so often at a book. The mother is the mother we've all always wanted...and she was no doubt the perfect mother for this child. Who else could take in stride the unleashing from a matchbox of a small cache of scorpions during dinner. I will reread this book again and again. Such light hearted appreciation of nature is a rare find. This would be a great gift for any child or adult who loves the outdoors. Very special and very rare. <br />
B0006SSOHC|4.0|When I saw this movie in the theatres, I left thinking with mixed thoughts.  On one hand, this movie is incredibly raw and visceral.  It gets under your skin with its disturbing images and ideas.  On the other hand, we have the most horrible acting jobs by some very talented AAA actors.      Danny Glover plays a cop who is tracking the Jigsaw killer.  Cary Elwes is playing one of the possible victims of said killer who finds himself locked in a dingy restroom with two people, one in the center of the room who apparently blew his brains out and another unfortunate soul locked on the other end of the restroom.      It seems that the Jigsaw killer has been kidnapping people and finds ingenuously creepy ways for them to kill themselves.  He never really does the act of it, but makes it so that it's virtually impossible for one to survive.      That is the premise for the movie, and I won't spoil anything else.  Part of the reason I liked this movie was because of the pacing.  I found the movie to be expertly paced, with mounting tension and a lot of dread.  You wonder how or even if the two victims will ever make it out alive.  The other reason I enjoyed the movie was the way it set up the past of former victims and current victims, even pulling in Danny Glover's character in interesting ways.  There is a thread that holds everyone together and I found it incredibly fascinating.    One thing reviewers have aptly mentioned is the gore.  This movie was a few shots over the R rating and had to be scaled down.  It is not for the squeamish.  If you've seen Se7en, you'll understand a portion of what the movie has to offer.  It's actually very surreal like Se7en and I think that movie is the closest I can compare to Saw.      So, we have great pacing, good actors, an interesting (if ultimately unplausable in some spoiler aspects which I won't mention) story, good gore and some nice suspence.  What holds it back?  The acting.  The acting is amateurish in spots and really detracts from at least two major scenes.  Where it really hurts the movie is at the climax.  This is supposed to be a fearsome, horrible, scary moment and instead I laughed because of Cary Elwes.  I hate to say it, but it really ruined what suspense had been building.    My other complaint with the climatic moment involving the title stems from a very sudden change in the character.  You know it's going to happen because it's been talked about constantly.  Yet, the motivation for the character to do it seemed a bit forced.  I think it would have been much much more effective if we saw the GRADUAL drive towards the act, not an instant jump.  I think his character could have been more effectively developed.  But that is just a preference as a plot buff.      My 4 star review, then, comes from the fact that the movie was done a very small budget.  They shot the entire movie in 18 days because they could not afford any longer.  That means that each scene was not really a \\"final cut.\\"  Instead they had to go with first or second takes simply because of funding.  The acting becomes understandable under that constraint.      In the end, this movie doesn't have many jump out, cheap scares.  It has a more subtle terror that gets under your skin and makes you look under your car and in your closet before you go to sleep.  It's terrifying in a non-normal Hollywood way.  It's in your face and visceral.  In all honesty, if you like crime thrillers like Se7en, if you like horror movies, and if you aren't squeamish, then this is definitely a horror movie to see.  There are enough twists and turns and suspense to overshadow the poor acting.  Recommend a rent and possibly a buy.
B0001Z53AQ|1.0|I picked this up the day it came out (when My Band was a hit) and was anxious to listen to it. I soon realized that it was not the same D12 that I remember from Devil's Night. Do not waste your money on this; it is worse than Encore, which was also another bad album.   <br /> <br />1. Git Up - the album opener; you may have heard this song in the \\"How Come\\" video 8/10 <br />2. Loyalty f/ Obie Trice - This was a great song with Obie Trice, who I could not get enough of after buying his debut album \\"Cheers\\" 9/10 <br />3. Just Like U - Only Bizarre raps on this track.  He spits some hot lyrics; this is NOT on the clean version. 10/10 <br />4. I'll Be Damned - Terrible song. Definitely skippable. 4/10 <br />5. Dude (skit) - I don't rate any skits <br />6. My Band - You have all heard it. Way overplayed. 5/10 <br />7. U R the One - Eminem is not on this one and the video was not very popular at all.  6/10 <br />8. 6 in the Morning - an average song; the hook from Eminem kept me listening to it 7.5/10 <br />9. How Come - You most likely heard this song. Didn't like it before they released the video, but soon turned into my favorite song. 9/10 <br />10. Leave Dat Boy Alone - My favorite song on this album; all six mebers drop some hot verses. 15/10 <br />11. Get My Gun - A song about getting your gun; 50 Cent thanks everybody who bought his album at the end of the song. 9/10 <br />12. Bizarre (skit) <br />13. B---- - CLub song featuring all members of the group 7/10 <br />14. Steve's Coffee House (skit) <br />15. D12 World - title track produced by Kanye West; the production was the only good part about it 7/10 <br />16. 40 Oz. - second single; partially overplayed, but still love the song; Kon Artis and Swift are not on this one 9.5/10  <br />17. Commercial Break - freestyle from a new cat named Young Zee; has a song called \\"That's my N---- Fo Real\\" on the soundtrack of 8 Mile 4/10 <br />18. American Psycho 2 - BAD song; part one on Devil's night was MUCH MUCH (not a typo) better!!!!! 3/10  <br />19. Bugz 97 (skit) freestyle from deceased D12 member Bugz <br />20. Good Die Young - song dedicated to Bugz; not that great, by the way 5/10 <br />21. Keep Talkin' - aims at Ja Rule and Ray Benzino on this one, but still a bad song 6/10
B00005JMJ4|4.0|What category did it fall into? I absolutely loved it! Despite being told that I might not, and to indulge in some alcohol. I left out the alcohol, and found myself really enjoying the movie.<br /><br />I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, and I groaned when the opening shot was of Scarlett Johansson's butt in a pair of dreadful pink see-through panties. She is now hated by every woman, and loved by every man. Scarlett said that she was reluctant to be filmed in panties until Sofia Coppola modelled the panties herself to show that they would look horrible. The opening shot of Scarlett is actually influenced by a painting by John Kacere, which shows up later in the hotel.<br /><br />Bill Murray is a master at everything he does (except Caddyshack - don't start!), and my favourite movie up until seeing this was Groundhog Day. He's an older, subtler version of Jim Carrey, a simple facial expression will have you rolling about the floor with laughter. Particularly while he's shooting the commercials, the director is sooooo saying a lot more than just \\"intensity\\". Also the gym scene had me crying with laughter, and it got to the stage where it was painful. I loved how none of the Japanese is subtitled throughout the movie, leaving the audience just as lost as the characters. This was definitely a neat trick by Sophia, to really make you feel in touch with the lead characters.<br /><br />The whole movie is about feeling lonely, not fitting in, stuck in a strange country, isolated in a crowd, and enjoying the attention of a stranger. Scarlett's portrayal of a young wife is spot on. She suspects her husband of cheating; she can't understand the language; can't find anything to fill her day; and then can't sleep at night. The strange thing about Scarlett is she looks positively dowdy and frumpy in this movie, totally different from her glam red carpet persona, but the look is so appropriate for the movie.<br /><br />Regardless of what another reviewer said, this movie does not poke fun at the Japanese. Instead, the Japanese, although not highly featured, were hilarious, treating Bill Murray's character like some God. Plus, the language sounds really fun, although learning to speak or write it looks like trouble. Tokyo also looks like a really great place to visit, with all the bright lights, but I can imagine it would be also very difficult.<br /><br />There was a great chemistry between Scarlett & Bill, that definitely came across in the movie, although their relationship was kind of like Thora Birch's & Steve Buscemi's relationship in Ghost World. Which Scarlett also starred in, and boy, she's come a long way! Their characters, Bob and Charlotte, never actually introduce themselves to each other.<br /><br />Sofia Coppola wrote a lot of the film based on her life. The character of John (Giovanni Ribisi) was loosely based on her ex-husband Spike Jonze. Rumour has it that the Anna Faris' character, Kelly, was supposedly Cameron Diaz, with whom Spike Jonze worked on Being John Malkovich, though Coppola denied the connection in an Entertainment Weekly interview. (Friends fans: both Giovanni Ribisi & Anna Faris have starred in Friends!)<br /><br />Some dialogue was improvised, including Bill's lines in the photo shoot and his conversation with Scarlett about his Shiatsu massage.<br /><br />There are a couple of Sophia's trademarks in this including filming the sun coming through leaves of trees and filming from the outside of a car window looking in as the car moves. (Which in my personal opinion, is a really cool effect.)<br /><br />The film's Spanish title in South America, \\"Perdido en Tokio\\", and its Hebrew title in Israel, \\"Avudim be-Tokio\\", both mean \\"Lost in Tokyo\\", meaning that the titles themselves were literally lost in translation. The reason being that there is no Hebrew phrase \\"Lost in Translation\\". An Israeli wouldn't understand the phrase.<br /><br />In the hospital, the question that the elderly man with the cane tries to ask Bob (in Japanese) is: \\"How many years have you been in Japan?\\" Meanwhile, the diagnosis that Charlotte receives from the doctor (in Japanese) is that her toe is fractured, but taping is enough.<br /><br />The ending of the movie had me in tears, as you knew perfectly well, that it was just a short friendship, that wasn't meant to continue outside of Japan. You can feel that they're both going to miss each other, and that visit will be something they'll always remember. The kiss between Bill and Scarlett at the end of the movie was not in the script, but was an \\"in the moment\\" ad-lib between the performers. The whispered bit was a truly emotional moment, and is open to interpretation about what he said to her, and what it meant. I'm not going to do what some reviewers have done & turn the volume up loud, to see if they can hear what was said, or make up rude/stupid things that Bill said. It was the best part of the movie, apart from the gym scene. It was the perfect ending to a terrific movie. I loved the fact it just ended like that between them. Sofia could have gone in a completely different direction, or she could have made Bill actually say something to Scarlett, instead of whispering it.<br /><br />The extras include: a conversation with Bill Murray and Sofia Coppola; deleted scenes; Kevin Shield's \\"City Girl\\" music video and Mattew's Best Hit TV-Extended scene.<br /><br />This is a really brilliant movie, and I urge everyone who hasn't seen it, to watch it at least once. I want my own copy now. And it's not often I say that about a borrowed DVD. In a few years, this will be considered a classic. Right now, it's just excellent.<br /><br />Oh, and watch right to the end of the credits. I know it's stupid to watch right to the end just for this, but a Japanese woman waves. Hey, it's no Shrek, but it's still funny.y man with the cane tries to ask Bob (in Japanese) is: \\"How many years have you been in Japan?\\" Meanwhile, the diagnosis that Charlotte receives from the doctor (in Japanese) is that her toe is fractured, but taping is enough. <br /> <br />The ending of the movie had me in tears, as you knew perfectly well, that it was just a short friendship, that wasn't meant to continue outside of Japan.

B0006IIKS0|4.0|See this movie even if you aren't a Metallica Fan.    If you are a Metallica fan, you probably have seen it already.   First you see them in state.  Tens of thousands gathered in a stadium, eager for the chance to have James Hetfield to spit beer on them. Then the camera zooms in to an intimate setting with the band and shows what those 20 years of being metal gods have done to their emotional development.  The best word I can think of for their egos is \\"unwieldy\\".  The documentary catches them at the moment of realization that their egos are getting in the way of their music and their lives.   I give them credit for even starting to look at that stuff and on top of that agreeing to have it all captured on film.      I spent the first half of the movie convinced it was all a put-on.  The usual psycho-babble applied to their work as creators of speed metal was too much of a contrast, especially when former band member Dave Mustaine was whining about how much he hurts. Everywhere he goes, people are shouting, \\"Metallica Rules!\\"  I busted a gut.  By the end I was sure it was real.  It was too underplayed and under-produced to be a put-on.        James Hetfield comes back from rehab with a post-treatment attitude of emotional maturity and a whole new retro, indie band image for himself.   Underneath that image, you can see this guy who just doesn't know who the hell he is, trying on a mask to see if it works, terrified, looking for approval from his bandmates.    A telling moment is when they were forced to do an advertisement for a company that owns a million radio stations and are basically told by their manager that they won't get airplay for their new album if they didn't do the ad.  I couldn't believe they didn't have more power in the marketplace than that.  This goes a long way in explaining why I am always disappointed when I turn on 93X.    I remember this Beavis and Butthead episode.  They are watching a music video of some forgotten metal band and Beavis saysof the drummer, \\"Lars could kick that guy's ass\\"  I know what they mean.  He's the toughie of the group. After watching Some Kind of Monster, Lars is the one member of Metallica who remains unknown.  He is truly a tough businessman, tough drummer-guy, tough personality who doesn't really show his cards in the movie except to say that he didn't expect the thrashing his image got with the whole Napster thing.    There is a plot, their problems come to a head and are largely resolved, James Hetfield seems to get more comfortable with himself and they actually made the record with a few songs I'd like to hear again.
B0006GAOBI|1.0|Yes, I do compare this version of the brilliant film Donnie Darko to Star Wars.  And why would this be relevant?  Because it seems that the director of this film, drunken with the ravings of fans and critics, has decided to make a small buck and tinker with something that was sacred..and you don't just do that.  Alright Richard Kelly, your movie was a cult hit, it touched lives, and it almost seems that the carelessness and savagery you've displayed in destroying your film are indicative of a general lack of care for your fans.  To quote one of your great characters in the film:  \\"I have serious doubts about your commitment to Sparkle Motion!\\"  And what is so bad about this \\"director's cut\\"? <br />       Many things, and too many to list here, but I'll throw out a few that Darko fans are sure to remember.  The opening scene, with it's beautiful panorama and ghostly music has been altered to include the intrusion of chirping birds and new sound effects that take away the original impact of the scene, afterwhich the Echo and the Bunnymen song \\"Killing Moon\\" has been replaced by the much less enthusiastic INXS song \\"Never Tear Us Apart\\".  Speaking of music, Kelly has taken songs out of their original place throughout the film and completely rearranged them in a much less compelling way.  Remeber that great scene where Donnie is following a timepath with the Church's \\"Under the Milky Way\\" playing?  Gone.  Replaced by the ending of the \\"Killing Moon\\", which just does not work.  One wonders if Kelly didn't just take all of the bonus material on the original DVD and slap it in, including the Roberta Sparrow book, rearrange the music and add a few new sounds in the mix.  Is this what fans wanted?  Maybe we were happy with what we had?  The extra scenes are all on the original, along with the book, so why buy this?  Well if you are like me, then you got caught up in all the \\"Donnie Darko is being re-released in a suped up form\\" hysteria and went out and impulse bought it.  Well I wish I hadn't, and from one fan to another, trust me..this one is not worth your money.
B0006J28KU|3.0|This is not a review over the film, which I can consider to be above average (four stars). What I'm here to moan about is this new Collector's Edition DVD. While delaying this disc Warner Bros. did us all such a wonderful favor and didn't even remaster the transfer! It is for the most part, the very same transfer that is on the previous disc. And over 4 hours of bonus features? I think Mann's commentary probably counts towards 3 hours out of four. Poor release. Worst I've seen from Warner Bros. in quite awhile.
B000000W9Z|5.0|Outside is Bowie's darkest, and conceptually most coherent album to date. It's also one of his very best records. Outside is not always easy on its listener. Its mood is so dark, and the   instrumentation is so sparse at times, it can be a bit hard to digest. It's also a concept album, and charactars get introduced in little snippets. Those can be a little bit silly, and they make the album overly long. Besides, the story isn't really ineresting, and even if you should want to follow it, you'll probably get lost almost right away. Fortunately the songs work well in their own right and the album contains a good mix of song wich have an instant appeal to them, and songs that take longer to appreciate. Best example is for me \\"The motel\\"; it took me over a year to recognize its beauty. Now it has become one of my favourite Bowie songs of all time.   On Outside Bowie is backed by a very solid band, with Mike Garson on piano being the key player. But in the end it's the   exceptional songs that make Outside such a great album. Give it some time, and you'll probably (or hopefully) find that there are little other Bowie albums that contain such a vast amount of brillant songs.
B00063MBU8|1.0|this is seriously the worst kind of crap.  i actually listened to this album, thankfully i didn't waste my money on it.  there is nothing original or even slightly good about it.  in fact, i had a hard time trying to find something about it that doesn't make me want to plug my ears with forks.  it's horrible.  but what's worse is the fact that they get all these other posers that think dying their hair and piercing their lip makes them individuals.  punk rock is finally dead.
B000001EAQ|5.0|Back in 1997, when really Rock was looking pretty dead, 2 exceptionals albums were released: <br /> <br />Radiohead 'Ok Computer' and U2 'Pop'. U2 had matured sufficiently in the 90's to allow them to move away from any generic mainstream rock cliches. This is a great album, of that there is no doubt, and if it wasn't then I doubt it would have been anywhere near as influential. Compared with later works, this album is so much better in terms of music songwriting, production, lyrics, art and performance.  <br /> <br />In truth, despite deserving limitless admiration for succeeding in the mainstream with a defiantly anti-commercial album, this album was bashed by mainstream critics, the same who later loved the dull, commercial and lame ATYCLB. Still younger fans buy ATYCLB first, and this one is overlooked. What a pity!. They don't know what they're missing. <br /> <br />Pop is just a truly transcendental and disembodying experience. This was a decent commercial success so there must be a fair few people in the world who are willing to appreciate good music. Cheers.  <br /> <br />
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Let me just start by saying that I am not one of those zombies that lives and dies by what the hipsters over at Pitchfork think. Sometimes they're right and sometimes they're horribly mistaken. I for one think that Death Cab For Cutie is nothing but a glorified Blink-182, Iron and Wine is a slightly more talented Jack Johnson (and that's not saying much), and Franz Ferdinand are, well...just really lame and are nothing more than a blatantly derivative-retro act. That being said, this is a very good album, a great album, in fact, that you should most definitely add to your collection. There's some beautiful Belle and Sebastian-esque orchestration that builds and builds into an explosive crescendo at the end of each song (most notably in the gorgeous \\"Crown of Love\\"), and some Talking Heads-ish inspried delivery (\\"Laika\\" sounds like David Byrne and the beginning of \\"Haiti\\" sounds suspiciously like \\"Naive Melody\\"...hmmm...). I'm not going to go into how this album changed my life and write some weepy review...Pitchfork already did that for me, and quite frankly I have better things to do. Don't take my word for it, buy the album, and let the music convince you. One thing I will agree on in regards to the album is that is indeed inspirational...I mean, if these people can record a full-length record in the midst of the death of countless family members, and then sing about it in such an unabashedly frank and beautiful manner then there is hope for the music industry yet. It's like \\"Rumours\\" but, uh, about death...okay, I'll stop talking...
0743487583|4.0|\\"Night quickly shut in, but to my extreme wonder, I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers.\\"  -  It describes how the monster was left all alone and didn't understand anything, but would find out a great deal about people.<br /><br />Victor Frankenstein is a person who likes to be with people but at the same time likes to be alone.  He created Frankenstein.  He is a really friendly guy but at the same time he has a passion to get back at the monster he created for killing all of his friends and family.  He has a thing about doing what he thinks is best too.<br /><br />The Monster is someone who doesn't understand the meaning of life.  He goes around trying to find out his purpose, and he is treated badly by every human he meets.  So he goes bad and starts getting back at Frankenstein for making him and not making him a wife.<br /><br />The story takes place in Europe, around the 17th century.  It mainly takes place in Geneva.<br /><br />It is a mystery kind of story.<br /><br />He used a lot or describing words, he described everything really good.  He used a wide viraty of words.  He is a good author, and he kept the ending good.  I liked it.<br /><br />The problem is that the monster starts killing people and Frankenstein has to stop him.  The monster is going out of control just to get revenge at his creator.<br /><br />I think that people who like adventurous books would, but they have to be able to read a lot, and be able to read through some boring parts because there were a few.<br /><br />I liked the book and would rate it a 7 out of ten.  But the author used a few words a lot.  But the story plot was good, and was pretty easy to follow as long as you were reading it and not just looking at it.  It grabbed my attention, but at the same time some parts were just boring.  And if you were to read it you would have to be able to know what some of the words mean, there were a few weird words too.  But all in all I liked it.<br /><br />I would definitely read another book by this author.  But this time I wouldn't cram all of my reading in until the last minute.  All in all I liked the book.<br /><br />By JTall I liked it. <br /> <br />I would definitely read another book by this author.

B000687M48|2.0|Excited to discover this \\"new album\\", I almost bought this.  But, it's just the last album repackaged with a DVD! <br /> <br />If you don't own the first album, this would be a good deal.  However, if you already own the first album, be prepared to have just purchased the same songs!!
B0006399FS|1.0|This album should be against the law for this to be packaged as U2. Bono's strained vocals ruin the album, and the songs are missing the whole talent they had back in the 80's and 90's. It's clear U2 have nothing else to prove, and they don't even want to. This album just shows their 2000 musical ignorance. U2  should be ashamed of even taking credit to these 'songs'.  Consider this record to be the ultimate undoing of this once legendary band. Too bad their time have come and gone.  <br /> <br />And yet every time U2 appear, their adoring fanatics react to it like it came from the Holy Scriptures... dream it all up again instead. <br />
068987474X|4.0|This is a refreshing, liberating and funny self-help book. I was not going to read it because the title alone struck me as so sexist, so demoralizing. But it's not. It's like reading advice from a protective older brother who is wise to the ways of other men. Go into it like you're panning for gold, because some of it you will probably want to toss out, but there is enough wisdom here to make it worth the price of admission. Also, if you pick it up and have attitude towards Greg Behrendt before you even crack the book, skip ahead and read chapter 15 before you start at the beginning.
B0002OERI0|5.0|When I heard their song American idiot, I think that this song is just intresting and it's same as their past styles. But I should have changed my thinking when I heard their all the songs in this album. This album is like a system, well connected. Some songs are connected by something, If you have chance to listen this album, I strongly recommend you to listen this cd without resting or stopping. Their songs are just light and fun, of course they had musical ability as now, But this album is something special. Becuase They yell having same subject. Like blaming to Governments..and I watched the program music awards. I was happy that they got triumph! anyway, If you have some money, don't hesitate, and choose this album! <br />you will satisfy with it! trust me!
B00062IVKI|4.0|There is something to be said for Martin Scorsese's \\"New York/New York\\" (1977). I'm just not exactly sure what. A strange mix of seventies sensibilities and sexual mores, eclectic acting styles a la its two mismatched leads, and forties kitsch billed as tributary to the decade of returning war heroes and the big band sound, the film abounds with complications that make for a generally uneasy, often heavy narrative structure. Truthfully, the film neither emulates or celebrates the great musicals of the 1940s. Instead it somehow manages to impose a contemporary strain on vintage material, which from the vantage of 30 years removed today, seems ludicrous and tacky.  <br /> <br />Robert DeNiro stars as Jimmy Doyle, a gregarious sax player who's all thumbs when it comes to impressing WAC officer, Francine Evans (Liza Minnelli). But, as many of the male machismo flicks of the seventies teach us, if at first you don't succeed with the fairer sex, simply badger her into submission. This tactic works for Jimmy, but only superficially and temporarily as the film charts Jimmy's rise to big band leader status, his explosive romance with Francine, their trials and tribulations, his spiral into professional oblivion and their ultimate break up and loose reconciliation after Francine has made it big on her own. Clearly uneasy with the musical as a genre, Scorsese lets the first twenty minutes of his film slip by without any music, and then junkets a string of stagy numbers that are not memorable or apt at recapturing the effervescence of the 40s. The one big production number, \\"Happy Endings\\" comes much too late to make a difference in the film's musical repository and draws a direct and scathing comparison between Liza and her mother, Judy Garland's performance from \\"A Star Is Born\\" (1954). \\"Happy Endings\\" is a sort of \\"Born in A Trunk\\" ballet that unfolds with Liza encountering a Broadway producer while working as an usherette in a movie house. But the juxtaposition of several musical snippets is clumsily staged. The mileau of bits comes to a head with Liza flouncing down a great glittering and mirror staircase in a costume that can only be described as over the top in its gaudy red and white texture.The most outstanding aspect of the musical program is undoubtedly the title number, sung against a backdrop that again, looks much too contemporary for 40s chic.  <br /> <br />Again, about the leads; the banter and chemistry between DeNiro and Minnelli is, at times, quite good - but never more engaging or hilarious than during their initial meet in a posh New York nightclub. Hence, their burgeoning romance seems oddly off balance with the two growing less comfortable with one another on camera as the fictional relationship progresses. At times, Minnelli looks ill and withdrawn, her heavy make up and \\"Mildred Pierce\\" style hair pieces almost swallowing her face whole and often masking her inate ability to do comedy or drama as well as we all know she is capable of. As a direct result, only in her vocal abilities throughout the film does she truly excel; that rich Garland-esque bravado rocking the speakers with a powerful zest for the material she's been given.Ultimately the film did not find favor at the box office and, in hindsight, it seems little wonder.  <br />    <br />MGM's DVD is not anamorphically enhanced but it is widescreen. Colors are rich, vibrant and, at times, gaudy. Blacks are deep, rich and solid. Whites are generally clean, although there are instances throughout the film where a definite grain structure is noticeable. Overall, the highly stylized visual characteristics of this musical stinker will not disappoint. The audio is 5.1 surround and engaging throughout - showing remarkable clarity for a film of this vintage everywhere, but especially during the musical sequences, if only the original songs by John Kander and Fred Ebb had had something more to offer.  Extras include an intro by Scorsese as well as audio commentary that is not particularly engaging. There's also some deleted scenes that are pretty much a bust, but generally show a muted distemper on DeNiro's part for a film in which he clearly felt most out of his element. A theatrical trailer and photo gallery are also present for the asking.
B0002F7I9Y|4.0|If I had to use one word to describe this cd, it would be \\"heartbreaking\\".  To hear the age and illness in this once great voice just brought tears to my eyes.<br /><br />Some of the duet choices, as well as songs, were puzzling. Some worked (Bonnie Raitt, Willie Nelson, BB King), some did not (James Taylor, Michael McDonald).  I really liked the fact Billy Preston was there showing us how talented he is.<br /><br />My favorite was the surprising Willie Nelson/Ray Charles rendition of \\"It Was a Very Good Year\\", a Frank Sinatra tune in which an old mans years is reflected through the women in his life.<br /><br />The \\"black man, white man\\" in \\"Heaven Help Us All\\" I could have done without, even though Gladys Knight still has a beatiful voice and it is, for the most part, a lovely song.<br /><br />B.B. and Ray absolutely shine in \\"Sinner's Prayer\\", with Preston once again showing his stuff.<br /><br />Another great blending of talents was Bonnie Raitt and Ray with \\"Do I Ever Cross Your Mind?\\". I had never thought of the two of them as a duo but it is one that really works.<br /><br />\\"Hey Girl\\", no. Seemed strained and forced. McDonald was not at his best.<br /><br />\\"Crazy Love\\". As much as I like Van Morrison, I may have to listen to this a few more times before I pronounce an opinion on this one. Same with Elton John and \\"Sorry Seems to be the Hardest Word\\".<br /><br />Norah Jones, Dinana Krall, and Natalie Cole are lovely voices blending with Ray on some great songs. I expect excellence from these ladies and they do not disappoint.  Johnny Mathis is a 'great' in his own right, and it was nice hearing him here.<br /><br />I have read some of the other reviews and am aware in some minds I am committing sacrilege by implying anything other than perfection in Ray Charles' last work. He wasn't perfect, but he was great. This cd isn't perfect. Is it great? I don't know. Did this cd deserve all the Grammys? I don't think so. It got them because the great man had just died. Is it worth buying?<br /><br />ABSOLUTELY.great man had just died. Is it worth buying?  <br /> <br />ABSOLUTELY.
B00000099Y|5.0|I am sick and tired of reading these negative reviews of this Tool album. Quite frankly this album is brilliant. It is fantastic Tool music. I have something to say to all you negative reviewers. What do you expect to hear when you listen Tool? Some nice pop rock type tunes. They're not that kind of band. They are heavy, ugly and violent rock and rollers. In fact the style of Tool can be best described in the name of one of their songs. The song is called: Cold and Ugly. So if you wanna hear Tool, that's what you should expect to hear. It's a fabulous album.<br /><br />Recommended to any Tool fans or someone that likes this kind of rock style.
B000001DQG|2.0|Of his 70s classic output, this LP is probably John's weakest. Named after the studio where this was dashed off in the middle of a tour (a little over a week of studio time), it's obvious the stress was getting to Elton and Bernie. There simply aren't a whole lot of memorable songs here.<br /><br />The one most will know is ballad \\"Don't Let the Sun Go Down on me\\", one of the most enduring tunes in Elton's canon. \\"The Bitch is Back\\", while relatively slight, was a big hit for Elton as well. \\"Ticking\\" portrays an armed standoff that could have come from today's newspaper clippings. After that, the good stuff is slim pickings.<br /><br />\\"Pinky\\" is pleasant enough, but alongside Elton's other love songs clearly a lesser effort. \\"Dixie Lily\\" is an homage to a Mississippi riverboat. \\"You're so Static\\" is \\"Sweet Painted Lady\\" part two..\\"I've seen the Saucers\\" is a nice look at life through the eyes of the folks who claim to have met with aliens. \\"Grimsby\\" is a heavily fictionalized look at an English seaside town.<br /><br />The nadir of the album and possibly Elton's catalogue is \\"Solar Prestige a Gammon\\". Yes, I understand that he wrote it to mock critics for \\"reading too much\\" into his lyrics. But when John Lennon did the same thing, he came up with \\"I Am the Walrus\\" and at least the wordplay was clever. \\"Stinker\\" is also pretty aptly named.<br /><br />As far as the bonus tracks go, you get a decent Christmas tune (\\"Step into Christmas\\") that still gets holiday airplay Stateside, \\"Pinball Wizard\\" is the song from \\"Tommy\\" first done by the Who and probably should've replaced \\"Solar Prestige\\" on the album. A good cover is better than a misbegotten original. \\"Sick City\\" is a jibe at New York City. Again, it's better than a lot of the material on the album. \\"Cold Highway\\" was a B side to \\"Bitch\\" that also should've made the cut instead of some of what did.<br /><br />In summary: Only completists will need to own this, but if you're a pretty big Elton John fan it's worth getting for \\"Ticking\\" and the bonus material. All others should go grazing elsewhere.<br /><br />2 1/2 starsit's worth getting for \\"Ticking\\" and the bonus material. All others should go grazing elsewhere.  <br /> <br />2 1/2 stars
B00062IVKS|5.0|\\"Raging Bull\\" (1980) is, bar none, the best work that director, Martin Scorsese has ever done in American cinema. Though not recognized as such at the time of the film's original release, and somewhat eclipsed in popularity by the later successes of \\"Casino\\" and \\"Goodfellas\\", it is in \\"Raging Bull that Scorsese really hits his stride. The film is a not-so-fictional, often critical and harsh account of real life boxing legend, Jake LaMotta (Robert DeNiro). Not that LaMotta would disagree with that assessment. In fact he would probably add that the film pales in comparison to the sort of lunk-headed jerk he was with his first wife, Vickie (Cathy Moriarty). Scorsese, admittingly not a fan of boxing at the start of production, sinks deep into the material and comes out swinging as the undisputed champion. The evocative black and white (except for rare color sequence) cinematography really captures the mood and feel of old time boxing news reels. Of course the other half that makes the story sparkle like no other sports movie before or since, and cannot be overstated, is Robert DeNiro's masterful performance as Jake. Gaining and losing some sixty pounds for the shoot, in every ounce of his being and delivery, DeNiro is LaMotta. The line between character and actor is so poignantly blurred that the performance stands out as genuine and raw in its reverence and sincerity to both LaMotta and the sport. Joe Pesci, who at this point in his career had almost decided that acting was not for him, establishes an indelible light as Joey LaMotta that would continue to burn in his many works since this one - both with and without Scorsese. The rest of the cast, hand picked by Scorsese for their non-actor-eque qualities, come off as real life patrons of the ring, an inspired artistic mileau that with each new viewing seems more like a hidden camera account of LaMotta than its fictional equivalent. DeNiro rightfully took home the Best Actor Oscar for \\"Raging Bull\\". Scorsese and the film were wrongfully overlooked. <br /> <br />MGM/UA has given us a stunning new transfer of \\"Raging Bull\\". The black and white image is smooth, beautifully contrasted and very nicely balanced. Blacks are deep and rich. Whites are generally clean, except where Scorsese has deliberately toned down the contrast for artistic effect. Fine detail is fully realized throughout. There is no edge enhancement or other digital glitches for a picture quality that is staggeringly beautiful in all of its sustained and intense glory. The faded color sequences, deliberately rendered that way, are poignant snapshots of a private life that add yet another layer to the telling of this tale. The audio, remixed to 5.1, like the Raging Bull himself, packs an incredible one/two wallop. The sound field is engaging, intense and always on pitch. Extras include a string of interesting documentaries that chart the film from conception to post production. LaMotta as well as DeNiro are on hand to comment. There's even a side by side LaMotta to DeNiro fight sequence to compare styles in fighting. The film's theatrical trailer, a gallery and audio commentary round out the extras.
B000255LNE|5.0|Phil Collins' other greatest hits CD, \\"Hits\\", had a good selection of songs. Although, it didn't have some of the songs I like, such as: Do You Remember?, Everday, Can't Turn Back the Years, and Don't Let Him Steal Your Heart Away. But this collection of all Phil's love songs has all of the songs I just listed. It has lots of other great love songs too like Can't Stop Loving You, You'll Be In My Heart, Please Come Out Tonight, and One More Night. This 2-disc set also includes some brand-new live performances like Seperate Lives and My Girl. This is definitely a great collection of Phil Collin's love songs. Its too bad that Valentine's Day already pasted because this would make a great gift for your sweatheart. :)
B0001AP12G|5.0|I LOVE THIS ALBUM, his stuff is just really catchy, but i guess that's all in a matter of opinion/taste. As to why this album is good, you can read all the other 5-star reviews for that. I'm not going to say that he's the 'savior of hip-hop' or 'the best rapper out', but i def. believe that a lot of people will enjoy this album. His beats are not bad, and his rhymes are different from whats out 'mainstream-wise'...I just know it's been a year since it came out, and i still listen to it, now i'm just waiting for 'Late Registration'  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />-- IF YOU DON'T HAVE THIS ALBUM, SERIOUSLY, GO OUT AND BUY IT!
B000089CJI|5.0|I'm sure there are going to be just as many 5 star reviews written as there will be 1 star reviews.  Those 1 star reviewers will claim Give Up is \\"too poppy\\" or \\"not real IDM/electronica\\" or \\"I'm too Xiu Xiu hipster to give the Postal Service a chance\\" and so on.  The fact of the matter remains, Ben Gibbard & Jimmy Tamborello have crafted one of the finest \\"pop\\" releases all year.  Pretty much every track has a catchy melody or hook that will bore it's way into your head until you start thinking, \\"Man, I NEED to start making music like this.\\"  The production is amazing, and the music is never indulgent, hence the short running time.  \\"The District Sleeps Alone Tonight\\" is one of the finest album openers of the past few years.  It is one of many tracks off of Give Up that manages to marry melancholy emotion with a dancey, yet strangely dark, musical atmosphere.  Even if you hate DCFC, or Dntel, indie music, IDM, etc, you should check this album out... undeniable greatness.
B0006Z2KYI|3.0|Ernst Lubitch's \\"To Be Or Not To Be\\"(1943) has to be the most genuinely bizarre political satire to emerge from Hollywood's golden age. It stars Jack Benny and Carol Lombard as Joseph and Maria Tura - a married couple and stage performers living in occupied Poland during WWII. Determined to alter the course of the war, the two helm a troupe of ham actors in a dead pan comic assault on the Nazis When a spy emerges who has damaging information to the Polish resistance, Joseph and Maria decide to prevent the information from being delivered to the Reich. Benny's brilliant lampoon of Hamlet's soliloquy \\"to be or not to be\\" is at the crux of a disastrous rendezvous between Maria and Lt. Stanislav Sobinski (Robert Stack). Stan gets the hots for Maria - a passion not reciprocated. Hence, when Stan is dispatched for war, he cruelly implicates Maria with Professor Siletsky (Stanley Ridges), the real spy who has a secret plan to destroy the Warsaw resistance. The theater troupe is then forced to use their thespian skills to ensure their own survival; impersonating Nazi officers and even Hitler in order to outwit the enemy. Controversial to say the very least, \\"To Be Or Not to Be\\" opened to modest acclaim and was later remade, to limited effect, as a 1983 farce starring Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft.  <br /> <br />Warner's DVD treatment is middle of the road. The black and white image has been mastered from reasonably clean film elements. Contrast levels are adequate, though at times weak. There's a hint of edge enhancement and some fine detail shimmering, but nothing that will distract. Fine details are sometimes nicely realized but darker scenes suffer from inconsistent quality. Film grain is moderate. Age related artifacts are present throughout. An archival news reel and short subject are the only extras included.   <br />
B0006GAI6O|3.0|Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon play outwardly happy couple in this remake of the little known 1996 Japanese movie of the same title. Gere is stuck in a humdrum job, but is more than comfortable with a family, wife who works for Saks Fifth Avenue, two children, and house in the suburbs. Never wanting to appear ungrateful or unhappy with all he has, he is \\"Mr Popular\\" at work, but inwardly missing something in his life. During his commute home he notices Jennifer Lopez at the window of a broken down dance school each evening, until curiosity gets the better of him and he stops by to investigate. What outwardly appears at this point as a standard infidelity flick, turns into a gentle comedy as Gere enrolls in the school and finds friendship and fun with his new dance class opposites, and starts to come alive. His wife soon begins to notice his late nights and odd behaviour, as do his kids and hires a private detective to find out if he is cheating, and the story is cleverly laced with many of the elements that anyone in a long term relationship will recognise. This is a lot of fun to watch, and although maybe not intellectually stimulating, it isn't overly sentimental or sugary either. A great support cast, most notably from Stanley Tucci as Gere's quiet work colleague who is secretly a wild latin ballroom dance exponent, and a wide collection of quirky characters add fun and balance to the picture. Predictable? well yes and no, there are a few surprises along the way, some great comedy, a little depth of emotion, and overall a good balance. This is wholesome family viewing with a capital W, and the direction and script though tight are a little too far on the right side of the PC line to be quite believable, but that's my only real complaint. Gere is great, and refreshingly mature in this role, Lopez a visual distraction, and Sarandon nicely grounded as the doubting wife. Not quite 4 stars, but a great couples movie (probably older couples that is). Enjoy
B0006Z2KX4|5.0|\\"Bringing Up Baby\\"(1938) is the adventageous screwball comedy about a madcap New England heiress, Susan Vance (Katharine Hepburn) who, after accidentally running into stuffy zoologist, David Huxley (Cary Grant) is determined to land him as her husband. Not that David would notice. He's too concerned with acquiring a bone for his museum collection - go figure.  But a gregarious little terrier named George (actually Asta from \\"The Thin Man\\" series) intervenes in David's plans, burying the irreplaceable fossilized bone somewhere on Sue's country estate. Meanwhile Baby, Susan's leopard, threatens the whole show by tearing up the scenery, as leopard's will do, after escaping from her cage. Naturally the whole mess winds up in front of a local magestrate, who lacks the ability to put two ideas together and come up with one coherant thought. The supporting cast is a who's who of crazies, including Charles Ruggles as Major Applegate, a pompous big game hunter, May Robson as Sue's dotty rich aunt, Elizabeth Random, and Barry Fitzgerald as the congenial scatterbrain, Mr. Gogarty. Director, Howard Hawks infuses his artistic mileau with every screwball gag in the book - and a few never before seen - illiciting the overwhelming and riotous laugh a minute that has made \\"Baby\\" one of the unique highlights in film comedy history. Not that anyone knew it at the time. On the contrary, \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" was widely panned by the critics and did only modest box office on its initial release. But hey, what did they know? Time has proven that \\"Baby\\" is the one to beat; a high water mark of comedic prowess that only the likes of someone like Preston Sturges could hope to match. <br /> <br />Warner's 2-disc special edition of this vintage comedy is a welcomed treat for DVD-philes. The black and white image is astoundingly solid. The gray scale has been impeccibly mastered from very clean film elements. Contrast levels are superb. There's a hint of edge enhancement now and then, but nothingthat will distract. Fine details are fully realized. Film grain is kept to a bare minimum. Aside from the very thorough commentary track by Peter Bogdanovich, disc 2 of this DVD contains two feature length documentaries; one on Howard Hawks, the other on Cary Grant. There's also a couple of vintage short subjects and a gallery of trailers from other Howard Hawk's films. Very nice. Bottom line: \\"Bringing Up Baby\\" is a sheer delight and this new DVD expounds twice the good time in its beautifully rendered picture and sound quality from the good people at Warner Brothers. <br />
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|My feelings on Troy are mixed.  While I did enjoy the action/war scenes that reminded me of Lord of the Rings, there was the small detail to the story and plot that just completely blew my mind.  Why, if you are going to make a history epic such as this, would you focus so intently on the characters that the story (which should have been the star of the film) pretty much falls to the wayside?  I think that it has something to do with who you have carrying your story.  If you have actors that are a little less defined in their careers, perhaps you would focus more on the story giving us the way that Homer would have been happy with.  Instead, we headline huge actors to carry the roles and focus more on the shirtless wonders of the world instead of the written word.  It is sad and unforgivable at the same time.<br /><br />To begin, let me tell you what I really liked about this film, which shouldn't take up too much space, but is still worthy of mention.  I loved the grand scale of this film.  When I read Homer's work, I didn't think of this tiny little incident that felt and looked like a back lot to a movie studio.  I wanted epic visions of land, wars, and chaos.  I wanted to be placed right in the action by being transported to the era visually and audibly.  Director Wolfgang Petersen did this with the greatest of ease.  This is a big production film, and he never allowed us to forget that.  Second, I enjoyed the smaller stories of this film.  The hints and references made to the culture at the time that allowed those three years of Latin class, Greek Mythology, and history of Troy seemed to constantly keep a grin on my face and my mind in motion.  It reminded me of Disney's Hercules, one of the most underappreciated Disney films out there.  There were subtle hints and clever moments that just placed that intelligent smile on your face.  Troy did the same even threw in a couple \\"fun\\" CGI moments for everyone to share, but sadly that was it.<br /><br />If you could turn the sound off on your television or surround sound and watch this film, you probably will experience a better picture than I did.  From the opening scene until the very anti-climactic moment in Troy, the hardest trouble that I had was the accents that accompanied our actors.  Brian Cox is one of the worst as I nearly found myself laughing in hysteria when he bellowed his first lines in a very un-Greek British accent.  This was followed by Orlando Bloom dawning a very unmasculine British accent coupled with Peter O'Toole looking very un-Trojan in his element.  If that wouldn't have been the tip of the ice cream, we were allowed to add sprinkles with the grunting force of Brad Pitt as our heroine/anti-heroine Achilles.  Taking moments from Rocky and Cobra, Pitt gives us his worst performance to date as a man given the strength of millions, but the emotions of a child.  It is sad to see Pitt butcher such an amazing character and never look back in suspicion.  This was not the role for him, and somebody (even the best boy) should have stepped out of his place to inform the Hollywood hitter that perhaps he was making a grave mistake.  Unfortunately, nobody came through and Troy was created and the power of Fight Club was thrown right out the window.  Corporate Hollywood had its field day in the Trojan sun.<br /><br />Another steaming issue that I had with this film was the pacing and timing of the overall picture.  Why did it take two hours to get to the most popular moment of the film?  Why did Petersen bog the viewers down with idle moments of passion and unnecessary character development when really we were most interested in learning about the infamous \\"Trojan Horse\\" and the \\"Achilles Heel\\" references?  I would hate to say it, but those were two of the reasons why I was very interested in seeing this film.  I wanted to see Petersen's portrayal of this historical moment, but instead what I discovered was that choppy editing left too much on the sandy desert floor.  It felt, at least to me, that the ending was very rushed and very underdeveloped.  The ending seemed cheaper to me, and without giving anything away, almost out of the precedent set forth by the beginning of the film.  I think Petersen knew that he had run out of time and the budget was already too big, so the ending was forced to suffer.  This ultimately hurt the film more than helped it giving it that sensation of a two-week science project done the night before.  I felt sorry for those involved with this droopy ending.<br /><br />To be honest, you had a very powerful story here that failed due to corporate Hollywood deciding to cast big names to fill the parts and place more emphasis on who was going to get the most screen time instead of story.  The actors hurt this film more than most will imagine because they just never fully represented the power of Homer's work.  I would have never imagined seeing Brad Pitt fighting along in Greek/Trojan times, and even after seeing this film I still cannot.  Brian Cox, normally fascinating in every film he does, just fell flat on his face in this film with the yelping of British words during this era.  It didn't fit causing the epic to quickly transform into nothing for that another summer blockbuster.  The story didn't help much either, forcing us to desperately want to get back into our High School Latin class to relive the truth of the story one last time.<br /><br />SEMPER UBI SUB UBI!!!<br /><br />Grade: *** out of *****floor.

B000089RV6|1.0|Woaaa! I was blasted out of my seat after i heard this ablum! AC/DC Is Soooooo heavy! Trash, punk, dirty dirty, scarry metal! When i first heard the ablum i was eating a side salad!! And i almost choked! This calibur of music could easily be compared to the twisted guitar riffs of newfound glory or simple plan!
B000002MTU|5.0|Look, I'm not versed enough in blues to be able to give you a comparative analysis, but this is just my personal opinion. This IS the very best of Eric Clapton. Eric names influences such as Robert Johnson, yet his typical guitar work, the work that has earned him the title \\"Slowhand\\", just doesn't do his talent justice. Sometimes I think Eric is too humble. He doesn't really showcase what he can do- especially in his more popular albums. This release however, Eric just cuts loose.. especially the last track \\"Groaning the Blues\\"- he just lets you have it! Eric's guitar groans and moans and gives you some of the most raw emotion ever heard from him. The album IS the reason why Clapton is such a stellar guitarist. To me, nothing in Clapton's past, from Cream to John Mayalls Bluesbreakers to any of his other solo releases, can touch the guitar mastery of this album. It's an unequivocal testiment to this man's gift.<br /><br />I rank this CD above all else, including his newest \\"Me and Mr. Johnson\\". Compared to the newer blues release, this is grittier and seems more real.. you really feel it in Clapton's voice when he sings these songs..  it doesn't sound contrived like I think \\"Me and Mr Johnson\\" has a tendency of doing. Hope this helps.
B000002UAU|5.0|Hi,well i got into the beatles late,around 1980 but have loved them ever since. this album is like ordinary english life in the 60s seen through a lsd tinted glasses. absolutely beautiful and magnificently surreal at the same time. the reviewer below who stated that this would unanimously have been the best album ever with the sublime penny lane/strawberry fields included is spot on. listen to this album and drift off in your mind to a not so distant england. heck this is the best album ever!
B00008S2VG|5.0|This album was released at a time when it was almost criminal to say anything against the US government and Bush.  Its a pity that this album was swept under the rug because it is just plain awesome.  This shows Madonna critically looking at herself and realizing her errors.  This album certainly deserves a second look by people.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Here's the deal with this movie.....If you are the kind of person who needs the laughter button to remind you that a certain part of a movie/tv show is funny then this flick is not for you. On the other hand, if you have any sense of humor I really can't see how you couldn't enjoy this movie. The characters are all cleverly made and the idea behind the movie is truly original. Napolean is the poster-child for a dork, dork, dork....He wears black snow boots in the summer for crying out loud! This is definatley a \\"cult\\" movie on par with \\"The Big Lebowski,\\" \\"Army of Darkness,\\" \\"The Warriors,\\" ect, ect, ect. You will either know all the lines to the movie or you will watch it once and never again. hope that helps.
B000002NJS|5.0|This is by far Madonna's best work to date.  While Music is funky and American life is self critical, Ray of Light shows a Madonna that has gone past her naughty past because of being a new mother.  This was the first album that I have ever bought so, it has sentimental reasons for me.  But besides that, the music here is just plain deep, almost poetic even.
0739316478|2.0|The story opens with promise with numerous twists and turns from the White House to lobbyists to big buck lawyers... And then just when I'd settled in for this return to classic Grisham, the book darts aimlessly down some diversionary path for about 30 chapters. Grisham drones endlessly, describing in ornate detail Italian cuisine, architecture, customs and the like.  <br /> <br />The book could have been condensed into a 5 chapter short story, complete with a pointless, drifting conclusion. Nothing to do with substantial plot development occurs in the middle 80% of the book. Granted I was educated IN DETAIL on Italian vocabulary and pasta, but felt somewhat ripped off. <br /> <br />If you're looking for a primer before an Italian vacation this is the book for you. Otherwise, save your time.
1573225517|4.0|High Fidelity is one of my favorite movies so I though I'd give the book a chance. I really wish I had read the book prior to viewing the film because I couldn't help but picture the characters in the book as they were represented in the movie. I think this was a bit detrimental to my reading experience because I didn't come in with a fresh slate but I still thoroughly enjoyed the book.    High Fidelity tells the story of Rob, a middle aged man, boy really, who dwells a bit much on the past, is enamoured with music as much as he is with women, and seems to love making lists. Rob is the main character but there is a colorful cast of side characters like Dick and Barry, workers at Rob's music shop. There are also the women of Rob's life who come into play many times through the book.     High Fidelity begins with Rob recounting his top 5 most memorable break-ups and the book moves on from there. Rob's hi-jinx with the ladies are often quite funny and really memorable. They're also sometimes pathetic really, the problem there being that his stories and his dealings with the women are often very relatable and make you take a longer look at your relationships.     If you've seen the movie then you'll be familiar with the setup of the book. Rob, going through a midlife crisis of sorts after his last breakup with Laura, goes around moping and contacting all the ladies on his Top 5 break-up list to ask them what he might have done wrong.     The book is written without a lot of actions, or descriptions. A lot of the book gives us an inside look at Rob's thoughts. Rob is often musing, talking, thinking to himself and we have front row seats to all of this. There is also a lot of quick, witty back and forth between characters whether it be Rob talking to the great Dick and Barry(who are a bit different than how they were presented in the movie, I think I liked the movie Dick and Barry better, probably due to the great acting there, but here they're great too), or talking to the many women there are in this book.     High Fidelity is a very enjoyable read for both sexes above a certain age. I can't really see kids enjoying this book as much as adults would, not that there is anything that might offend, but because a lot of the story deals with adult situations that most kids won't really relate to. However, If you're a middle aged man, you might see similarities between yourself and Rob. If you're a woman, you might get an inside look at the inner thinkings of most men this age. Men might deny it but Rob is actually a good representation of most men his age. And that is why the book works, the characters, and relationships are realistic. Sure, it's not the exact male but each man should find  a part of himself in Rob's actions, words or mannerisms. There's also the musical aspect of the book. A huge part of Rob's life is music and the author includes that in the book with lots of musical references and comparisons. If you're a music afficionado, there's probably nothing new here, but if you're not you might learn something new about music.     I give this a good recommendation. It's an enjoyable read with good characters and well written, funny, realistic dialogue. It's set in London but you don't need to know anything about England or English mannerisms to enjoy the book so don't let that scare you away from reading the book.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is wonderful. Everything about it was perfect. Nothing could have been done better. The singing, the acting, the emotions, it was all amazing. When I first went to see this movie I was afraid that it wouldn't be as good as it should be just because that's how a lot of remakes are, they don't usually live up to the first one; or if it's a play they never make it turn out right. Well this one did. This has become my all time favorite movie, and that's hard because I'm a movie fanatic. This movie is definitly worth everyone's time.
B00005R24K|4.0|Its a classic worth whatever you pay for it, so buy it and enjoy it. Its funny, scary and gory all at the same time which make for a great low budget horror. amust in any cult horror collection.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|The movie is basically about a geeky kid and his friends trying to just get by in High School. The movie is surrounded by idiocy and is nothing more. The problem with \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is it's characters are too over-the-top in the geek department which makes it useless in my opinion. You can't sympathize with these characters because they aren't realistic like many people say you can with these characters. So you're left with characters stumbling   through school acting like morons and nothing else. If you're into it then you'll love it and if you're not then oh well. If you want   a good form of entertainment filmed in the style of \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" with better dialogue and characters then watch \\"The Office\\"(It's a british comedy series out on DVD) but other than that... I'm done.
630589938X|4.0|I personally have always enjoyed CUJO. I remember see'ing it when i was a young lad and enjoyed it then and still do now. A must for any fan of horror or whatever category people would put it in. A movie about a rabid dog that traps a mother and her homo son in a car a little boring in the begining but becomes a very good action filled .Worth the money as it was one of the first dvd's I purchased.
0316172324|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell is a talented writer. He summarizes some good researchers' work in a very readable way (i.e. the thin slices research that was popular in academic circles a few decades ago). You'd have to be a professor to not learn something from this book, and you'd have be a Pulitzer prize winner to not appreciate the quality of the writing. These positive features earn the book 4 stars in spite of what I view as a profound flaw.  <br /> <br />The major problem with Blink is that it has no explanation for when to trust our instincts. The book title suggests that non-cognitive and rapid judgments are good. As amply pointed out by other Amazon reviewers, this idea is ludicrous. Gladwell provides no roadmap of when to trust our first impressions and when to attempt to override our first impressions.  <br /> <br />First impressions are sometimes good and sometimes horribly wrong. Now what? Gladwell provides no answer. <br /> <br />In my own academic research, I investigate what I call the \\"lizard brain\\". We use our brain's prefrontal cortex when we attempt to think rationally; however, our behavior is often influenced by the rest of the brain, the lizard brain.  <br /> <br />In Gladwell's language, the lizard brain is sometimes right and sometimes wrong. The answer to knowing when to trust the lizard brain and when to shackle the lizard brain, I have come to believe, is to understand the logic of the lizard brain.  <br /> <br />The lizard brain is great for lizard activities like finding food and shade.

B000050FEN|5.0|I don't give 5 stars easy, but this one was a 5 star movie. It was a honest to god masterpiece. This is probably one of my favorite movies of all time. This was the best thoughtout movie of all time! I recommend this to anyone! (Obviously not young children, but you get the drift.) The twist at the ending will have you stunned!
B000000OAC|5.0|If my memory serves me well, I think this could be the second album I bought with my own money, the first being George Harrison's 'Thirty Three and 1/3' from 1976. This one was also bought at SEARS, and I can remember kids at my school were allowed to bring in their favourite singles to play at lunchtime, or just in class. ( I can't recall greatly why, but I remember it like yesterday) So in the middle of your 4th grade day in 1977, you'd hear Stevie Wonder's 'Sir Duke', or 'Fly Robin Fly', or 'Kung Fu Fighting', or 'Disco Duck', and 'We Will Rock You/We Are the Champions'. It's one of my fondest memories of school, before we all become choosy about these people should listen to this music, and those people should listen to that music. In 4th grade it didn't matter, and 'We Will Rock You/We Are The Champions' was enjoyed as much as 'Sir Duke' by black and white alike.<br /><br />Another thing about 4th grade, and no matter what Parents Against Profanity/Lewd Works say about the influence rock has on children, is I had no clue what Freddie Mercury was referring to in 'Get Down, Make Love'. To me, at 10, ''you say you hungry, I give you meat'' wasn't about THAT. To me, at 10, I thought he was talking about making dinner for someone. And that's the thing that these 'concerned parents' should realise. Kids have no frame of reference for innuendo or connotation unless you purposefully give them one. I had no idea about Freddie's sexual preferences when I was 10, and I didn't care. So why would I know what he was talking about? It wasn't until I got older did I listen to the song and say 'Holy ****', what did my parents think when this song used to be played at huge volumes in the basement of our house? I have to give them credit for trusting me with this sort of material, because evidently, it did me no harm. Though it is shocking to see how truly innocent I was at 10 years old!<br /><br />Another thing I got from this album was appreciation for Roger Taylor. After buying this album, and all their other albums, Taylor became my favourite member of QUEEN. He wrote great songs for them, and besides Freddie, had a powerful voice equal to their lead singer's, even if with a different style. The Roger Taylor Fan Club started for me with this album, and it was all after hearing ''Fight From The Inside'' which to this day remains my favourite song from this album, and quite possibly my favourite Queen song. When they released solo albums later on, Taylor's were the only ones I bought, and still listen to regularly.<br /><br />There is some great material on this album, particularly May's ''Sleeping on the Sidewalk', the aforementioned 'Fight From the Inside', and 'Sheer Heart Attack', also by Taylor. May's 'It's Late' was always a firm favourite as well, along with Mercury's 'Get Down, Make Love', and Deacon's 'Spread Your Wings'. This album is a sentimental favourite, so I can't say fairly if its better than this, or better than that. It's the first Queen album I ever bought, so it has a value that 'judging' cannot favour or control. Certain songs I avoided as a child, like 'My Melancholy Blues', 'Who Needs You', and 'All Dead, All Dead', but as a I grew older, these songs started standing out a bit more, and I began to appreciate the talent that went into them. Though 'Who Needs You' sometimes gets a skip, the commercial songwriting ability of John Deacon should never be underestimated. If he had been a solo artist, his catalogue would be quite successful on it's own. Who would have sang his material I don't know. I've never even heard the guy speak.<br /><br />It's not a Queen album filled with their trademarks, and it's a much toned down affair than 'Sheer Heart Attack'/A Night At The Opera/A Day At The Races', but even in economy, Queen still deliver some great material, from heavy rock (We Will Rock You/Sheer Heart Attack), to funk (Fight From The Inside), to arena rockers (We Are The Champions/Spread Your Wings/It's Late), to a more adult contemporary approach (My Melancholy Blues/Who Needs You). The diversity each songwriter has makes Queen not a confusing process to listen to, but an enjoyable one for its display of talent and co-operation.), to a more adult contemporary approach (My Melancholy Blues/Who Needs You).

B000148KK2|5.0|The Girl in the Other Room is - in one word - FABULOUS.  Diana Krall has always been a very talented vocalist and pianist and I have most of her other albums.  And I really like them.  But her latest record (Girl in the Other Room) is an entirely different thing. <br /> <br />Krall has always, until now, pretty much been a \\"cover girl\\".  Her songs have previously been covers of various jazz classics.  Diana's not a \\"cover girl\\" now though.  Her relationship with Elvis Costello (now her husband) has led to an unbelievably impressive musical collaboration between these two.  With Diana writing the music, and Elvis doing the lyrics, Girl in the Other Room contains some of the very best songs I've heard in many years.  Unbelievably intense, emotive, passionate, and downright fun-to-listen to music. <br /> <br />Buy this album NOW...
B000001EL3|4.0|I can imagine the conversation now.<br /><br />Bob Ezrin says to KISS, ''Hey! Have you guys ever thought about taking this seriously? You know, this music and album thing?'' Whether stunned silence, or agreeance was had, where people said, hey, yea, we could come up with something artistic if we try hard enough. Whatever happened, Ace Frehley disappeared, Peter Criss gives them a hit song, Paul Stanley dominates, Gene Simmons writes some interesting stuff, and a whole host of guest writers come in.<br /><br />I've just read a review of Dressed To Kill after writing one myself. I cited that 'She' and 'Love Her All I Can' were two standouts on an otherwise 'paint by numbers' album, and reading someone else's review pointed out that those two songs were resurrected from their earlier material. And this is where a problem begins. Maybe KISS had dried up by the time 1976 rolled around? I can hear it on Dressed To Kill, where Simmons and Frehley are just not coming up with as good material as the first two albums shows so strongly. They're both working at 50%. Actually on Destroyer and Rock and Roll Over, Ace practically disappears entirely from writing, or even playing the guitar solos. (I always wondered why some of my favourite Frehley solos weren't on Destroyer!).<br /><br />And as DTK presents, Paul Stanley takes over most of the writing, and I just don't feel he comes up with as good  material as Simmons and Frehley when they are both working at 100%. Stanley providing 70% of the material, with only 30% being something truly 'classic', does not make for great KISS albums. Peter Criss makes up for this, whether you like 'Beth' or not, by simply coming up with a song that ranks among their best songs, the songs people know them for. And many of Stanley's songs just don't hit that target, which is why three writers can sometimes be better than one. Simmons and Frehley's 'backseating' in songwriting truly makes this band suffer a bit. Frehley had the musical talent, and an honesty in his approach. Simmons their best voice, and provider of much of their best 'riffs'. With these two just going through the motions, or altogether disappearing, KISS becomes a rather standard affair.<br /><br />There are also moments where you can hear Ezrin's production style carried over into Pink Floyd's The Wall (1979). Little touches here and there. Where all these outside writers came from (apart from Penridge and Ezrin), I don't know, but it's the first indication that despite the success that was coming to this band on the horizon, there was trouble in paradise before they even got there. Not a good thing to be in trouble before you've arrived, usually it happens after all the money, fame and stardom come around.<br /><br />Though I think 'Great Expectations' is a great song in itself, as far as taking chances, it just seems a bit too slapstick in subject matter. It's obvious Simmons had a huge appreciation for The Rolling Stones, you can hear it in his music and approach. But Jagger & Richards tend to match the subject matter with the level that the music indicates it needs, and Simmons just doesn't get that. Here he writes a great song, but fills it with cheap elements. He has, or had the potential to be a lot more than what he's known for. Maybe Ezrin saw that, just like Eddie Kramer maybe saw potential in Ace Frehley.<br /><br />As I've grown older, I feel that Simmons wasted some of the talent he does possess. Because time and time again he writes really interesting material, that other people could easily cite as being influential, if not for what he decides to sing about. 'Sweet Pain' is an indication of that talent. There's nothing wrong with female backing singers appearing on a KISS song, especially when the songwriter can actually write material that deserves that treatment. And Simmons could. I'm never quite sure what to think of him truly. Sleazy genius? Underrated writer by his own estimations? Who knows?<br /><br />So KISS make an'arty' album, and it certainly is an interesting one. I can't say there are any bad songs on it, apart from my disappointment with 'Great Expectations', and the less than great Paul Stanley material. I've always liked 'Do You Love Me', it was my favourite song from this album as a kid. But as I've grown up, I just can't stand the way he sings most of it! I would rather hear Simmons singing it, who I always thought had a more controlled and 'cooler' voice. Frehley's one songwriting contribution is 'Flaming Youth'. When I was a kid, I kind of bypassed this song for 'Sweet Pain'. But as I've gotten older, I think 'Flaming Youth' is probably one of the best songs on this album, right up there with 'Detroit Rock City', 'God of Thunder', 'Shout It Out Loud' and 'Sweet Pain'.<br /><br />I have no problems with 'Beth' whatsoever. I think it's a nice change of pace, and Criss sings it great. At least he sings it honestly, no matter what you may think of such sentiment entering the KISS landscape. I've never been sure of 'King of the Night Time World' to be honest. I'm kind of 50/50 about it, and I think that's once again down to Paul Stanley's singing style. I'd much rather hear Simmons sing it, or even Frehley! I just don't care much for Stanley's singing voice, okay???<br /><br />Destroyer has enough material on it to be almost as good as 1974's Hotter Than Hell, and much better than 1975's Dressed To Kill, but I can't help but feel something's wrong here in KISS Land.r />So KISS make an 'arty' album, and it certainly is an interesting one.

B00005JNBQ|1.0|How in the world can a supposedly \\"Top 500, or 100, etc\\" reviewer give this movie anything other than one lowly star? I wish I could have bought the trailer alone, it was good. It bore no resemblance to the final cut in full length movie form. What a total waste of time. Inane and not worth the money.
B000000OAA|5.0|I rarely write a song by song review, but this album, which is most definitely my favourite Queen album, I can find enough to say about each song to warrant such a review.<br /><br />1.Brighton Rock<br /><br />May's opening track is one I listened to I don't know how many times. He is deservedly acclaimed as one of rock's premiere guitarists, and this song is a display of how good this guy will always be. Though it's not one of his orchestrated multi-tracked guitar turns, Brighton Rock shows how much Queen owed to Brian May and his talent, his inventiveness, and his 'sheer' playing ability. If only all bands had a guitarist this adept at approaching the instrument. Even Zeppelin.<br /><br />2. Killer Queen<br /><br />Mercury's timeless Queen standard probably has had more said about it than I could possibly add. One of its best moments is again, Brian May's orchestrated guitar solo. It's pretty amazing that in live versions, what he could play of it sounded equally as good, if not better. But here you have much of what Brian May is reknowned for, incredibly arranged multiple guitar solos, with a signature sound all his own, recorded for someone else's song. And that's what a band should be about. With Mercury's songwriting talent, what better is there than having Brian May contributing an incredible, and serving guitar solo to make the song 10x better?<br /><br />3. Tenement Funster<br /><br />Roger Taylor Appreciation Fan Club Alert. As said in another review, Roger Taylor is my favourite member of Queen, and this song is probably my second favourite Taylor song in their catalogue after 'Fight From The Inside' (1977). He comes from behind the drumkit to play rhythm guitar on this track, and the whole song 'rocks'. That May was not bothered that the drummer wanted to play guitar as well is cool enough, and later John Deacon didn't mind not playing bass on some Taylor tracks, and that's very cool. It meant that in Queen you could do what you liked to do, and unless it was absolutely horrible, no one minded. Truly what most bands should strive for, 'partnership'.Great vocal as usual from Taylor as well.<br /><br />4. Flick of the Wrist<br /><br />Probably one of Mercury's most underrated songs, and always one of my favourites from him. Again, an incredible guitar solo from Brian May, probably one of my favourites along with 'Dragon Attack' from 1980's 'The Game'. The Queen vocal harmonies of Mercury/Taylor and May (if that is the case on this song) were never better. If it's just Mercury, wow!<br /><br />5. Lily of the Valley<br /><br />Fading in from 'Flick', Lily is one of those sentimental Mercury songs that always has a soft spot in my heart from me. Vocally beautiful and melancholy, one of Mercury's best ballads. If not long enough in time.<br /><br />6. Now I'm Here<br /><br />May's song became a Queen Live standard, and the studio version is every bit as good. Again displaying May's guitar talents, Now I'm Here is typical 70's glam, but done 10x time better than what Glam sometimes got. One of my favourite songs from this album, not knowing how many times I've truly played it.<br /><br />7. In the Lap of the Gods<br /><br />Stunning vocals from Roger Taylor on this one (known for doing the amazingly high harmonies on 1975's 'Bohemian Rhapsody'). This vocal tour de'force is reminiscent of Queen II, but with more gravitas and experience behind it. It's half Oklahoma, Wizard of Oz, Wagnerian Opera. Truly an underrated Queen/Freddie Mercury song.<br /><br />8. Stone Cold Crazy<br /><br />Band composition, which is the first time for them as a group. Excellent song throughout. Too short!<br /><br />9. Dear Friends<br /><br />Beautiful Brian May song, which he became increasingly good at. If there is a sentimental Queen band member, its Brian May. Completely opposite his ''rocker'' style, May writes beautiful ballads.<br /><br />10. Misfire<br /><br />John Deacon's first composition for a Queen album, which is way too short. What needs to be said here is that if Queen has people good at something, there best pop song writer is John Deacon. He just has an amazing talent for Pop Music, writing incredibly catchy songs, which would later give Queen their hugest hit (even though it was quite reminiscent of CHIC). I have a vague memory of hearing this on radio, or I had heard it before I ever bought the album. Deacon is Queen's pop merchant, and this would be the first indication of his talent at this.<br /><br />11. Bring Back That Leroy Brown<br /><br />If only McCartney understood what could be done with songs reminiscent of a bygone era, songs like 'Honey Pie', 'You Gave Me The Answer' wouldn't be as 'quaint' or 'corny' as they are, when compared to what Queen could do with the genre, like this song and 1975's 'Seaside Rendevous'. This is what happens when you let as much creativity that went into those songs artists of long ago wrote (like Duke Ellington, Count Basie etc.)show up in your tributes to that era and style. It makes a great song, one that has so much 'talent' going into it, that you don't care it sounds like it came from 1930. The background vocals on this song are amazing, as is the musical arrangement by all 4. McCartney should have listened to a Queen album and Freddie Mercury before going back once again to the 1930's and 1940's.<br /><br />12. She Makes Me (Stormtrooper in Stilettoes)<br /><br />One of my other favourites from this album. A pretty obscure Brian May song, by what I guess is Queen standards. I've always loved this song and its moodiness, its off-chord ending, and the way May sings it. By far he had 'the gentlest voice' of the three main singers, which also lends to his 'softer side' as a balladeer. I don't know how many times I've listened to this one either. Tons.<br /><br />13. In the Lap of the Gods...Revisited<br /><br />A totally different version of the earlier song, and one I like just as much. Another underrated Mercury gem.<br /><br />If you're going to buy a Queen album, please get this one. Track after track its just one of their best, most inventive, and successful efforts. And showed how much of a 'team' they were in presenting what Queen was about.eeds to be said here is that if Queen has people good at something, there best pop song writer is John Deacon.

B000001EKX|4.0|The problem with 1974's ''Hotter Than Hell'' isn't the songs themselves, which prove to be stronger material than the preceding album (KISS 1973), and the follow-up album (DRESSED TO KILL 1975). It's the actual sound and recording of the album compared to these, and the song selections.<br /><br />Dressed To Kill was engineered by Dave Wittman and George Lopez in New York, Hotter Than hell by Warren Dewey in Los Angeles, and this makes a huge difference in the two albums. And it's a shame that Hotter Than Hell (HTH) with as many great songs on it that it has, is brought down by the inferior sound that Dressed To Kill (DTK) doesn't possess, but with not as many great tracks.<br /><br />The other problem is ''Goin' Blind''. To my mind (and ears) this song is a wasted opportunity. No one says that a band made up in clown makeup has to take itself seriously, but this song written by Simmons and Coronel kind of demands a subject matter worthy of its music. The music itself is great, as is the melody, and had this shown up later in their career (with a Bob Ezrin production or guidance), maybe the song might have been steered in a different direction. The tale of a 93 year old man in love (or lust) with a 16 year old girl is humorous when you get to that being revealed, and you have to laugh really. But the song itself is better than that subject. Maybe if Peter Criss or Ace Frehley had written the lyric it might have been a bit more serious, or at least more honest in its approach, giving it a 'Beth' or 'What's On Your Mind' standard and style. I think that's what the song deserved truly.<br /><br />I really can't think of a bad song on this album, and Simmons and Frehley's contributions make it one of their best and most consistent albums.As said about the recording, the songs go up and down in their quality, hitting a high on Simmons 'All The Way' and 'Watchin' You'. These two songs are one of the few where Peter Criss's snare drum doesn't sound like a Fisher Price toy. Once again, compare this album to Dressed To Kill, and try and imagine it sounding as good.<br /><br />Certainly Frehley's 'Parasite' and 'Strange Ways' deserved that quality, as did 'Goin' Blind', and Paul Stanley's 'Got To Choose'. It's just kind of an empty sounding album, not as full as it could be. It sounds cheap, but the material isn't, apart from 'Goin' Blind' and its subject matter. Frehley and Stanley's 'Comin' Home' is by far the song that most suffers under these recording conditions. The drums and rhythm guitar sound as if they were recorded a mile away from the studio. Thin and reedy, they make the song sound like it's not the worth the effort. But it is, and much better than some of the songs that appear on DTK, which is definitely a Paul Stanley dominated album, not always with the best results.<br /><br />Hotter Than Hell is worth a purchase, just for the sheer quality of the songs themselves, particularly 'Parasite', 'Strange Ways', 'Watchin' You', and 'Goin' Blind', but every song on this album might be some of their best work. And I wish when they got back together, instead of doing a new album, they went back in the studio and re-recorded Hotter Than Hell.

B0002ZDVEU|4.0|A little more dark than Bourne Identity, but still captivating in its story line and action scenes. As with BI, the DVD extras provide interesting background into the actors' preparation for the movie, as well as how the producers got some of their more difficult shots. I hope they do the hat trick.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I've always adored 'Phantom', but have never been able to see it on stage. Finally! I've seen this movie 12 times at the theatre (with a 13th planned for tomorrow!) which is a personal, and I assure you, unsurpassable theatre-going record. <br /> <br />It's hard to pin-point why the story and the music of 'Phantom of the Opera' has the effect that it has on me. I can listen to the music non-stop. There is something so magical about it. Gaston Leroux's wonderful and tragic novel in essence, is captured perfectly by Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical.  <br /> <br />I was never skeptical about the casting or the use of Joel Schumacher for the film. Probably because I never saw the show on stage (although I have listened to the original cast recording hundreds of times). I always maintained the perspective that you won't know until you try. It paid off. Gerry Butler is sexy, sensual, dark, tragic and enticing as the Phantom. Emmy Rossum is absolutely gorgeous, caring, naive and innocent as Christine. Patrick Wilson is dashing and romantic as Raoul. My favourite supporting character was Miranda Richardson as Mme. Giry. She superbly portrayed the caring mother figure as well as being trapped by what she knows of the Phantom. <br /> <br />All in all, I give it a well-deserved 10/10. The DVD is supposed to be released on April 20, 2005 in Australia (though I may have to order the special 2-disc edition from the states).
B00023B1LC|5.0|This is a movie I can watch at least once a month, if not more, and still become engrossed in the story. The action, the chemistry, the plot, the scenery combine to make this a classic movie in its genre.<br /><br />If you're not familiar with the Ludlum books, Jason Bourne wakes up shot on a boat in the Mediterranean Sea. He doesn't know who he is, how he got there, nada, but the firm for which he works wants to find him. When they begin to close in, Bourne's training kicks in. He singlehandedly disarms two gendarmes when they roust him from a park bench. He \\"knows\\" things that he has no idea how he knows.<br /><br />His search to find out who he is takes a strange twist when he finds a dozen passports in a safety deposit box. Each passport has his picture, but a different name. Through it all, his goal remains the same: He wants to quit running.<br /><br />This movie has one of the most satisfying endings of any of its genre I've ever seen. I want to watch it again right now just to see that ending, to be the hero, to be Jason Bourne.<br /><br />That's what I call a good movie.
B000002H33|5.0|After years of owning Master Of Puppets I still listen to this and still think this is one of Metallica's best CDs to date. The songs are timeless classics that all true metal-heads will know by heart. Metallica, while still around today, were at the top of their game for this release. While the later CDs (...And Justice For All, and the self-titled release affectionately nicknamed 'The Black Album') are still great, this is truly Metallica's best in my opinion. This album has everything. Heavy anthems (Battery), to a more mellow side of Metallica that still has the grit of heavier songs without ever completely busting out (Welcome Home). So it's with that that I readily call this one of the best albums of the 1980s.<br /><br />The CD starts off with Battery, an extremely heavy and fast-paced song. You couldn't ask for a better opening song. Master Of Puppets, a song all of us have heard, is still popular today after regaining recognition for being featured in the film Old School. An amazing beat with James' vocals is an automatic great song. A personal favorite song of mine is Leper Messiah. This is an extremely catchy song that stays in your head for days. That song just goes to show that 'catchy' doesn't necessarily mean 'pop.' Orion is an excellent instrumental track that sets up Damage, Inc. perfectly. Normally I don't like instrumental tracks, but with this song I become hypnotized, pushing the repeat button repeatedly. And finally, arguably one of my favorite Metallica songs ever, Damage, Inc. This song is perfect for playing loud while driving. Pounding drums, amazing guitars, great bass, and equally impressive vocals. This song is a must listen for any new Metallica fans, I feel that it defines them in their early career very nicely. If Damage, Inc. isn't my favorite song on here, Disposable Heroes definitely is. From beginning to end this song keeps it's integrity throughout it's 8 minutes. The bridge is simply unforgettable, this is a song you won't be forgetting any time soon.<br /><br />Some of my favorite songs are Battery, Disposable Heroes, Leper Messiah, and Damage, Inc. If you're a 'metal-head,' you should own this. This an integral part of the 80s that everyone should at least listen to. Everyone should here Metallica in their prime, not the phase they're going through as of now. This CD is without a doubt one for the ages.forgetting any time soon. <br /> <br />Some of my favorite songs are Battery, Disposable Heroes, Leper Messiah, and Damage, Inc.

0375751513|5.0|I had to go back and rethink and reread this story, but profoundly moved by how timeless the message seems to be.  Modern culture (Hollywood etc...) would benefit from what seems to be the basic MORAL of this story. The more shallow and superficial the pursuits in life, the more corrupt, evil, wicked and proverted one can become.  This is a fact, no \\"religious right\\" or anyone else, made it up. Many just turn their backs or ignore the truth.  Mr. Wilde himself should have taken a lesson or two from his own story.  What a tragedy with his talent to die sick, corrupt, lonely and penniless. At least this classic work came from all the sadness and despair.....too bad.<br /><br />I have often thought that this tale may be one that would be a great stage production/story....Mr. Wilde should have possibly considered it, again............too bad!

B000002I55|5.0|Listening to this CD in the car on the way home from the record store, I found myself cracking up. It was noise to me, pure noise that seemed totally unenjoyable. I sat there for what seemed like hours and when I looked at the CD player only 4 minutes had gone by. However, after listening to it again later that day, my attitude changed. <br /> <br />I felt myself getting progressively more in-tune with the attitude of the players. The mess of horns is at first repulsive, then bareable, and as you continue to listen, it becomes just plain awesome. Each horn has a different sound, and the sounds interact and weave together. It's really like listening to a conversation. One horn makes a statement, the others comment on it or interrupt it entirely. The horn reactions are very human, while the basses and drums provide the background (with that beast Scott LeFaro soloing a good deal of the time, if you can hear it over the horns).  <br /> <br />It really takes a keen ear to hear these things, or repeated listenings. It takes a sense of listening for not melody, but timing and texture. If you're into free jazz its a must. It's definitely its own specific genre... it sure as heck ain't bebop, people. A creative noise masterpiece.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Hayao Miyazaki is unique, this one and all his movies are not just for anime fans because they are totally diferent, are not just excelent animates, are excelent movies. Porco Rosso is one of this movies that makes you feel nice so you wanna see it over and over, his characters seem to be alive because they act in a very natural way, never overact as every other animated cartoons, the backgrounds are beautiful and refreshing, perfect stageing, perfect story, very funny and emotional, the right word in spanish is EDIFICANTE. Miyazaki is not of this world.

0553573403|5.0|Wow! My husband recommended this book and he said it was amazing, so of course, I figured he was exaggerating. As it turns out, he was right! The character development goes above and beyond. I actually found myself feeling real emotions for each of the characters. I love the way Martin focuses on one character per chapter, allowing you to really get to know the person and feel connected. I also think its great that he isn't afraid to present this story as reality, and to make the actions seem realistic (in other words, the good guy doesn't always win, though you root for him!). Overall, an awesome reading experience that I would strongly recommend.
B0006399FS|2.0|Where has all the variety gone with this band. I think the folks that really like this sound of U2, haven't really heard the classics like Zooropa, Pop, Boy or War.  <br />This sellout U2 really hurt me. I used to love them, but this album just shows they're dinosaurs. I've heard this album at least 10 times on a website but nothing on it will induce me to listen to it again let alone buy it.  <br /> <br />This is the sound of a band in terminal decline which is sad because at one time they were great. There isn't one song on this album that sounds new or original, the refrains don't come out well and the melodies just don't work for me...Sorry , I just don't like it!. It's sounds as if they're trying to reprise, yet again , the sound of Joshua Tree. <br /> <br />Every song sounds the same, which it say dreary, dull and devoid of energy. This is a band that finds ways to make nearly every song in its catalogue entertaining in concert; it will have to work diligently to pull it off with anything on HTDAAB.
B000068R1X|4.0|People that are giving this album a low rating are nuts. Lots of people say this is ozzy's weakest link.....I have to disagree <br />but maybe i'm old fashioned. People give no more tears much better rating........i think thats insane...The only reason no more tears gets so much acclaim is because your teeny bopper neighborhood kids can listen to it.....give me a break. BatM delivers.....for back then....I know Randy Rhoades death affected us all in the music world....but for the ozz to come back with a guy by the name of Jake E. Lee....Jake was amazing. <br />Anyone who caught Jake live in concert knows what i'm talking about.....as far as the songs on this album. Sure they were a little lacking but with tracks like \\"waiting for darkness\\", \\"your no different\\", \\"centre of eternity\\", \\"slow down\\". All great songs.......and of course the anthem \\"bark at the moon\\". Darker than usual from the Madman himself.
B00005JN0T|4.0|When I watched the trailor of this film I thought to myself now this looks quite promising. Often I end up in theaters and renting dvds for films which I never liked(Day After Tomorrow,The Recruit,Italian Job,From Cradle To Grave and the list goes on...)<br /><br />So I'm sitting at the start of the film wondering what to expect and I am simply amazed by the Will Smith's larger than life character in the film. We wouldnt like running into similar people in our lives but I do know I quite enjoyed watching how cool Will Smith's character is.He wears this long leather jacket which fits him like second skin.His walk exemplifies the brashness of his character. He's not meant for smooth talk and isnt a wise guy in the film.<br /><br />I think the Robots in the film were rather intelligently designed.There are many scenes in the film that are most superbly shot,plenty of fast cars,brilliant action sequences (especially the robots v/s humans)<br /><br />I wouldnt say the last 30 mins or climax of the film was exhilerating. The entire film has this certain adrenaline inducing smoothness about it. So much so that I think Will Smith was the perfect character for this. Recently, I rented the dvd to give the film a second watch. It made a good second watch. Now how many films can do that? I will be purchasing the DVD soon.<br /><br />P.S - I've seen the \\"Men In Black\\" series and am not a fan. If you expect this to be something like that then look elsewhere. This is only \\"better\\".
B0006SSOHC|4.0|...and if you do see it coming (I've talked to people who know some who have) then you need to take a break from the horror movies and get out more. It will probably catch most by surprise; it sure did me. <br /> <br />Don't watch this movie if you're expecting a scare. It doesn't even really have the creep factor even. Don't watch it if you don't like bloody violence. Watch it, instead, for something unique to rub elbows with all the carbon-copy movies and things out there today. Everything nowadays seems to copy everything else, for better or worse. Who woulda thought a low-budget movie like Saw would come up and kick people awake from the monotony of sameness?  <br /> <br />Sure, the show has its faults. Acting, for one, is definately at best B-grade (that's being nice, too). However, it doesn't quite go to laughable territory, which is good. Some parts will make you reflect going, what were they thinking? But by the end, you should hopefully be surprised (and a little repulsed - it's called Saw, people...I'll give you five guesses on what happens.) <br /> <br />One reviewer hinted that the reason they (DEFINES REASON FOR TITLE - SPOILER TO SOME???) didn't show the guy hacking his leg off (I sure don't think that's a spoiler, sorry if it is) is that budget restricted it. They expressed concern of a bigger budget for what must be the rumored Saw 2. Me, I express concern for a sequel to this movie, period. Two, I don't think they cut that (no pun intended) for money reasons. I think it may have been for ratings, people. By the end, plenty of brutalities has happened, and watching some guy rip his own foot off would probably push it past acceptable R-territory. <br /> <br />Anyway, it's a good one to rent once while its semi-new and talk with friends about. Definately not one to learn acting skills from, though :-) <br /> <br />Warning to concerned: R for bloody violence (duh) some language Not for the little kiddies (\\"Mama, look! That guy is hacking is foot off!\\" Not good) <br /> <br />Peace out
B00004WG2F|5.0|I really loved this poignent drama starring Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins - two of the best actors of our time.  They are pure magic in \\"Meet Joe Black\\" as well.  This is a very sad film but at the same time very beautiful.  The scenery and music are just wonderful.  There is a love scene, so not suitable for children.
0792846443|5.0|Misery is one of the more suspenseful movies I have seen in a long time! First of all, I must complement Kathy Bates for portraying Annie Wilkes in a very convincing, albeit frightening way. I'm so glad the Motion Picture Academy awarded her the best actress award in 1990. If you are looking for a movie to scare the heck out of you, watch Misery!! Also great performace by James Caan.
6305558175|5.0|This movie is a wonderful drama/romance set just after the civil war.  Richard Gere and Jodi Foster are amazing and this is a tear jerker for sure.  I love the court scene with James Earl Jones.  Worth the watching just for that.  This will make you think and leave you teary eyed for sure.  I highly recommend it.

When I bought this, my copy said PG by mistake.  It is a strong R rating.  I don't feel it has much to watch except the superb performance by Renee Zelwegger.  I don't recommend it and I love most period pieces.

0783233477|5.0|I can't tell you how much this film moves me.  Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins are pure magic together.  I also loved them together in \\"Legends of the Fall\\".  This has the most beautiful sound track with it - in fact I am using much of the track for a school play we are doing of \\"Our Town\\".  I could watch this over and over.  Many funny parts, like, \\"death and taxes?  did you say, Death and taxes?  You have to watch this to see the irony in this line.  There is a love scene, so not suitable for kids.

0345475674|5.0|This is a mystery story set in AD 79, just days before Mount Vesuvius buried Pompeii in a volcanic eruption. The new Aquarius (water engineer) of the area must find out what happened to his predecessor, who mysteriously disappeared without a trace.  Meanwhile, he is vexed by a strange interruption to the water flow in the aquaduct, and a mystery of poisoned fish.  Very fast paced, suspenseful, with good historical detail. It is like the movie \\"Titanic\\" in that you know the coming disaster, but not whether the characters will survive.
B000002J1Y|5.0|This 1973 live album was originally 3 LPs, now 2 CDs.  It's my favorite Yes album and possibly my favorite live album by anyone.  The album includes a couple of tracks (\\"Perpetual Change\\" and the \\"Long Distance Runaround/The Fish\\" sequence) from the 1972 \\"Fragile\\" tour, with Bill Bruford on drums.  The rest of the album was recorded later that year on the \\"Close to the Edge\\" tour, after Bruford had left to join King Crimson and was replaced by Alan White.  All three songs from \\"Close to the Edge\\" are here, and they're all highlights, played with more confidence and intensity than on the original album, as the band was now getting a better feel for the finished pieces.  The rest of the songs are all from \\"Fragile\\" (\\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" is also a highlight) and \\"The Yes Album\\", except for a Rick Wakeman solo excerpt from his \\"Six Wives of Henry VIII\\" album.  I've heard others complain about the sound quality, but it's not at all bad for live albums of that era, and I find it better than on the later \\"Yesshows\\". <br /> <br />As it was a 3-LP set, there is inevitably some padding: a long Bruford drum solo on \\"Perpetual Change\\", an interminable Chris Squire bass solo on \\"The Fish\\".  Heck, the band even included four minutes of music recorded by someone else -- the album begins with a recording of the last movement of Stravinsky's \\"Firebird Suite\\" that played as Yes took the stage.  Most of the tracks are at least as good as the originals, except for \\"Roundabout\\" and the overstuffed \\"Fish\\".  Some guitarist friends think that Steve Howe's solo on \\"Starship Troopers\\" pales next to the original. <br /> <br />(1=poor  2=mediocre  3=pretty good  4=very good  5=phenomenal)
0060005696|5.0|I happened across this book in a bookstore and went to the library to read it for free.  After doing so, I found myself reflecting on it so frequently that I bought my own copy and also some additional copies to give to others.<br /><br />In our culture of personal autonomy and responsibility the burden of making informed decisions requires that we indeed BECOME informed about each thing in order to make decisions intelligently.  Unfortunately, we are awash in information, marketing, and choices so that we must first either filter our choices, closing off other options, pick randomly, being influenced by factors outside our awareness, or never make the choice at all.<br /><br />This book looks at the area of shopping and commercial products but it occurs to me that it is relevant to many more areas as well:  politics - who can keep track of all the issues/legislation/candidates? Writing - not writing until you've thought of the \\"perfect phrase\\" is the very definition of writer's block.  Religion - in the face of so many creeds we wonder what to believe, and wait too until too late at the deathbed.  Careers - would I be more successful/happier elsewhere?  Education - what if I majored in something else, went to another school?  Relationships - perpetually \\"keeping options open\\" instead of committing to someone.  Investing - will you have a golden or bleak retirement based on your choices in the stock market?  Entertainment - you could spend an hour cycling through all the cable channels rather than watching a program.  Virtually every area of life has applicability.  Instead of being able to take the time to evaluate every option, we often default and go by instinct, past habit, or fail to decide, not realizing that time is running out of our mortal hourglass.  We are like tourists at the Smithsonian running from exhibit to exhibit, trying to see it all before closing time, and experiencing nothing.<br /><br />The author presents useful strategies to filter the plethora of choices we face, such as selecting the \\"good enough\\" that meets our criteria instead of waiting for the \\"best,\\" consciously narrowing our options, practicing an attitude of gratitude, etc.  But the greatest value will come to the reader who, after reading this book, puts it down and reflects on its applicability to the specific choices of one's own life.  We each have only 24 hours per day, and the clock is running., such as selecting the \\"good enough\\" that meets our criteria instead of waiting for the \\"best,\\" consciously narrowing our options, practicing an attitude of gratitude, etc.  But the greatest value will come to the reader who, after reading this book, puts it down and reflects on its applicability to the specific choices of one's own life.

1400032717|5.0|\\"God, I wish I could do this,\\" I found myself saying over and over again. Haddon succeeds in taking us INSIDE the head of a character many of us couldn't imagine being. Curious incident is many things: a darkly funny and startling coming-of-age story, a good old-fashioned mystery novel and a journey tale.  <br /> <br />Mostly, though, it's just very, very good.
B00000G3PA|2.0|I just can't. Okay, I am punished for having an engineering degree, and therefore being actuely aware of how ridiculous the science was and, more importantly, how NEEDLESSLY ridiculous the science was. So many of the things that just blasted my suspension of disbelief were throwaway lines of dialogue that could just have easily been written so that they weren't horribly wrong, e.g. the \\"13g turn\\" around the moon, which would have reduced our heroes to chunky salsa, could just have easily been a survivable 8. I know to some it seems like nit-picking, but I hate any movie that punishes me for having a brain.  <br /> <br />But let's set that aside. This movie is very Michael Bay, in that it is a loud, frequently, and very visually intense. This one, though, is TOO loud. It is just dominated by the sound effects, and a lot of stuff just needlessly blows up or is shattered. The film audially, and ultimately, visually is just so far over the top that it is difficult to enjoy without watching some slightly less large and ridiculous movie before it. <br /> <br />Okay, so we turn to acting. Here Bruce Willis continues to confirm my belief that his choice of movies will cause him to be forever underrated as an actor. He gives a fine, if slightly stiff perforance to lead this movie. A decent Ben Affleck bats second in the order, and from there it is a series of ridiculous cardboard cutout characteristics trying to be characters. Granted, for a summer popcorn-cruncher, you aren't looking for Shakespeare, but that still doesn't alter the fact that there is not much there. As a result the movie tries overpowered it's fault with frequent, large explosions, tragedies, destruction, etc. etc. <br /> <br />This movie has actually caused me, in normal conversation, to pull the mind-bending linguistic feat of referring to \\"Independence Day\\" as \\"restrained\\" in a sincere fashion, which should tell a potential viewer a lot. I can't completely hate this movie, because there is some qualityhere, and I know \\"The Core\\" exists, so I have to be able to rate something lower than this. If you have a true home theater, I can see how this thunderous film can be fun, but on any regular tv, this one is a snoozer.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|I have been listening to this album for half my life (14 years) and I swear it never gets dull/boring. Just like someone else here rightly said, this along with Master of Puppets will forever be remembered in metal history long after we are gone. Some idiots say that this album is overrated and has only a couple good songs. I say #uck them all naysayers. Every song on this album rocks like a hurricane and then some. I am really at a loss for words for this review. Check out the solos in Tornado of Souls/5 Magics, they will burn your face. Awesome! I am not going to spend too much time review a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Too much has been said about the vocal change, dont let it bother you so much. This is what I say. If you are a Megadeth fan, you already have this CD so should you get this remastered one? Well, the 3 demos make it worth it but only if you can spare $15 more. Unless you are a hardcore fan who needs to have a total catalogue from Deth, you could pass this over since you already have a copy. If you are hard-pressed for money, leave this alone. In case you dont have this CD, GREAT, dont waste a second, run to a store nearby and get this album. You, as a metalhead, will not regret buying this album. Its actually an investment, since you will be listening to this album many many times over in your life. For me, this CD is going to my grave cause I need to riff in peace.
0060931671|4.0|I got this book as a winter break project and unfortuantely finished it after summer break.  It's small, less then 200 pages but it was just so detailed and so complex that it rattled my brain.  I couldn't put it down but realized that I wasn't grasping what was being said.  The story moves like an epic.  I kept expecting something bad to happen, to have the plot peak but it wouldn't.  This book held me in it's grasp for over 6 months as I read and re-read it.  I now understand how this is considered a classic and recommend it to all serious readers.  Be warned however, there is more to the story then you think and if you're looking for an easy read then this is not the book for you.
B00062ZE44|5.0|I had been enchanted by WT. I have never heard such an enchanting symphonic metal abum ever.... No doubt there are tons of symphonic metal band b4 WT but I still think WT has their unique sound and signatures.... As I am writing this review, I am also watching their music video on their web site. I love this symphonic metal genre type of music.... Love everything about it. Really stands out and distinguish itself from everything else. I don't have to say anything else cause most of it has been said. Let the music do the talking.... Highly recommended....
6302054974|3.0|Even though the packaging states not once, but twice, that this 2-Disc set includes a spanish language soundtrack, guess again,IT DOES NOT!!! The packaging is misleading. I own previous versions of this classic flick(VHS,LASERDISC, and yes,the 1997 DVD release which states (correctly) a FRENCH soundtrack) The only reason I bought this new 2-Disc set was so that I could enjoy the film in my native language (spanish).  <br /> <br />I went as far as contacting Warner Home Video to get the lowdown on this problem or get my money back. A representaive in the legal department informed me that,just as I had asssumed, the packaging was in fact wrong. THERE WAS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE A SPANISH SOUNDTRACK IN THE FIRST PLACE!! I asked why and the representative kindly explained that \\"90% of Warner Home Video titles are for the U.S and Canadian markets, and therefore only include english and french soundtracks\\" Really? You mean hispanics don't live in Canada? She was kind enough to offer me a DVD from their catalog of my choice as an apology. Now that to me is great customer service. I chose another great Scorsese/DeNiro title. <br /> <br />So anyone out there considering buying this great 2-Disk set, be forewarned: THERE IS NO SPANISH SOUNDTRACK!! <br /> <br />P.S. Amazon, be sure to update your advertsing on this as well. <br />List the soundracks as ENGLISH 5.1  and FRENCH 5.1 so as to avoid any irrate customer complaints such as mine.
B000002WYT|5.0|Crash is most likely the best Dave Matthews Band recorded CD.  And it's not just because of Crash Into Me! Even Too Much recorded does not even sound that good. It's definately the DMB songs that are not as famous among the public, but known among DMB fans that make this CD. Two Step, Drive In Drive Out, Lie In Our Graves, and Tripping Billies are what make this second recorded release of DMB so worth while.  <br /> <br />1. So Much To Say- a good opener. Kind of a sing along type song and not to stereotype, but it kind of sounds like What Would You Say with Beauford singing backup vocals on the chorus. <br /> <br />2. Two Step- my favorite on the CD. It might be even better than the live versions. Has a dark overall tune that nicely blends with a happy chorus. <br /> <br />3. Crash Into Me- the most famous song on the album. This is one of the few love songs I have ever liked, but again who could not like it. It has a sweet and simple tune. Mostly Dave shines in this song. <br /> <br />4. Too Much- the most upbeat of all the songs on the album. Boyd does a good job with the violin here. The song combines hard blowed wind instruments with Dave's accoustic. <br /> <br />5. #41- slower song with still a trace of a rockish tune. <br /> <br />6. Say Goodbye- very peaceful song with the slow drums and the flute. This CD has some alsome songs and others that are just okay. This is one of them. <br /> <br />7. Drine In Drive Out- one of the most real rockish like DMB songs. The tune is not happy like Too Much but is still very upbeat. I like how Boyd's violin is intergrated. <br /> <br />8. Let You Down- another very peaceful song. It's still pretty good but compared to other DMB songs it's okay. <br /> <br />9. Lie In Our Graves- an unusual guitar sound combined with drums and all other sorts of instruments. Dave's accoustic sounds alsome here. <br /> <br />10. Cry Freedom- it's okay, slower. It almost seems like Dave's playing an electric here but it is supposed to be anaccoustic still. <br /> <br />11. Tripping Billies-one of the few DMB songs you can just go crazy and dance to. Simular to Too Much's upbeat sound but that's a very poor comparison because as we all know DMB's songs sound all completly different. <br /> <br />12. Proudest Monkey- the longest song on the CD that's okay. Basically the same tune throughout the whole song. This one can get boring.
B0002858YS|5.0|I first heard the song Somebody Told Me over the summer. After hearing it a couple of times on the radio and seeing the video on tv, I couldn't get the song out of my head. It eventually got to the point where I had to buy the cd becuase I had become so curious to hear the rest of their songs. I haven't regretted it a single day. This is my favorite cd. I cant pick out one single song I like the most becuase they are all worthy of that title. I tell everyone I meet to buy this cd. It is certainly worth the money.
B00004TDRD|5.0|This film is the heart of all new ideas for movies, the movie is basically a large shark which has inhabited an area where sharks are not usually found. The shark begins to attack people off the coast of amity island, the victims include a dog, a late teenager and a young child. This violent is much more violent that you would expect for a PG and contains scenes of gore, language, and will be scary for younger children.<br />I loved this film beginning to end, after the first shark attack i knew this was going to be a classic!!!<BR>*****

B00026W82U|4.0|This is an album that will make you think: \\"Hmm... I think I've heard those harmonies before!\\" It's probably because you have. Norway-based duet Kings of Convenience sounds a lot (at least how they sing together) like Simon & Garfunkel, which is quite a tribute to the the legendary duet so many years after their peak time.<br /><br />But there's more to them than being a folk duet. They have a slick chillout sound to them as well. It's like a touch (barely noticeable at times) of that bossa-inspired sound that became so popular a few years ago, can be found buried beneath the surface of some of their tracks.<br /><br />In sum, this is a fairly enjoyable album. Good to go with mornings and evenings. Take with moderation, however. Melancholy may strike you if you abuse it.
B0006GAI6Y|3.0|Surprisingly enough, I liked Shall We Dance. Although it doesn't break any new ground and although most (if not all) the characters are typical and standard for this type of film, Shall We Dance? still won me over in the end. This is a standard romantic comedy that that doest the one thing it should do; make you feel good, make you smile, make you feel happy. <br /> <br />Gere plays a man who has it all. A good wife, good children, a great job and a beautiful house. And yet, he's still not as happy as he'd like to be. Every night, while riding the train home, he sees this beautiful young woman standing at the window of a dance studion, looking longingly in the distance. One day, he decides to step off the train and he enters the dance academy, a decision that will change his life forever. <br /> <br />Although he starts taking dance lessons just to see the beautiful Paulina (Lopez), he soon realizes that he loves to dance. Even at work, he can't help but practice his steps while sitting at his desk. And yet, he cannot admit to his wife what he's been doing in hiding, afraid that telling her something was missing in his life before the dance lessons will hurt her feelings. And of course, his wife (played beautifully by Susan Sarandon), believes that her husband is having an affair. Why else would he be so happy all of a sudden? <br /> <br />I was greatful that this one didn't turn into a will-he-or-won't-he? story. There's never any romantic spark between Gere and Lopez. Although she does offer him the one thing he'd been lacking before, she doesn't do so in love. She does it through dance. <br /> <br />The film is fun, cute and fluffy. Gere is perfect as the romantic lead. who truly seems happy when he dances. His dance partners, funny if generic characters, are also well cast and effective. And for once, Lopez doesn't get on your nerves. Her performance is understated and, yes, effective. <br /> <br />I wouldn't mind seeing Shall We Dance? again a few years from now. It did bring a smile to my lips and it did make me feel good for its duration time. Although I'll probably forget most of it in a short while, it was good while it lasted.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I know die hard purists of the triology will disagree with me but I truly enjoyed these movies.  I'm a purist at heart and didn't like the fact that the movie was changed but let's be real - the story line is the very same and unless you've watched the originals literally dozens of times (to the point that you can recite the movie by heart) you're not going to notice a majority of the differences.  One change that I personally didn't like was at the end of the Return of the Jedi when Luke Skywalker sees the \\"glowing\\" Obie Wan Kenobi, Yoda and his father.  For some unknown reason they changed the actor who played Luke's father in this scene.  Despite the fact that it's just plain rude to the original actor, it didn't change the story line at all.  If you're a fan of the triology this dvd collection is well worth it for the updating that was done on the sound and picture as well as the fact that a dvd will last longer than a video.  I don't regret buying it one bit.
B0006SSOHC|3.0|I had a female friend who thought about seeing this movie at a theater near the beach.  The question was should she see Saw by the seashore? <br /> <br />Actually, beyond some puns, I'm not positive of the merit of this movie.  It is clever, probably too clever for its own good.  The story focuses on a serial killer who puts his victims in elaborate traps which over a minimal chance of escape.  Two men wake up to find themselves chained in a dingy bathroom in an abandoned building.  The only means of freedom are some rusty hacksaws which are just sharp enough to cut off a bound foot. <br /> <br />Through flashback, we are introduced to an obsessed detective who is pursuing this killer.  While bright enough to pick up tiny clues, he is also inept enough to wander into this genius killer's lair without a real plan or backup (beyond a single partner).  This allows the killer to get away and engineer his next trap. <br /> <br />Fortunately, there are not very many of these \\"dumb\\" moments, and in reality, the biggest problem with the movie is its convoluted nature.  For most of the movie, I wasn't sure if I was going to like it or not, and knew it would come down to the inevitable final twist, which was neither good nor bad enough to generate any real reaction. <br /> <br />One mark of a good movie is when you forget you're watching a movie:  with all the stylized direction and overly clever plotting, it's hard to get that absorbed in this film.  This is an interesting movie and not really a bad one, but it's also imperfect.  It also owes a lot to other movies, especially Seven, and you might be better off seeing those movies.  See Saw?  Some say si; I say you might enjoy it if you're a fan of these types of thrillers, but you might not.  I guess you could say I can't make up my own mind; I keep seesawing on Saw. <br />
B00000JCB2|1.0|Good points: Wu-Tang Clan's Method Man puts in an amusing cameo appearance on \\"N 2 Gether Now\\". Bad points: his performance only emphasizes how truly awful Limp Bizkit are without someone who actually understands hip hop lending a hand, and how lame Fred Durst is as a rapper and lyricist by comparison. Rap and Heavy Metal make a potent combination if done right (Rage Against The Machine, Faith No More, Anthrax & Public Enemy); this is a textbook example of how to do it wrong.
B00005JMYI|3.0|`Anchorman, The Legend of Ron Burgundy' (the unrated version) cowritten by and starring Will Ferrell is a sophomoric comedy based on one idea borrowed from the very rich plot of `Broadcast News', spiked with some tired themes the character Ted Baxter of the Mary Tyler Moore Show plus some other borrowings from less likely sources such as `Monty Python and the Holy Grail'.<br /><br />For starters, I simply did not laugh at this movie. Not once! It was less funny to me than a Three Stooges short, and I don't like the Three Stooges. This is not to say I don't appreciate some good potty humor now and then. I happen to think that Kevin Smith's foul-mouthed marathons such as `Dogma' and `Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back' are really very, very funny.<br /><br />One of the most deadly aspects of the movie was that it was predictable. You can see punchlines coming from two blocks away. Even the crudest, cheapest gag / shock value in the movie which involved Burgundy's small, much beloved dog being kicked off the highest point of the high bridge over San Diego bay could be anticipated, as improbable as cruelty to animals scenes are in movies. The fact that the canine body falling to San Diego bay was so obviously a dummy dog neither improved the comedy nor took the sting out of the cheapness of the business.<br /><br />Ferrell has had a fair amount of success since he left Saturday Night Live and many, including Kevin Smith attest to his comedic abilities, but I just don't see it. I watched `Elf' a few months ago and I could appreciate that it was a better than average Christmas movie, but it really wasn't anything special. I just don't think Ferrell has the kind of natural comedic talent of people like Billy Crystal or Dan Aykroyd, let alone the comic geniuses like Jim Carrey, Bill Murray, and Robin Williams. Carrey and even Williams can sometimes become parodies of themselves, but the lapses usually don't last too long, and in any given 5 minutes on the screen they will get a laugh out of you by hook or by crook.<br /><br />There are many ways in which this is not a really bad movie. It probably is no less a cartoon of its subject than `Zoolander' or `Animal', but it is neither laugh out loud funny like `Garfield' nor `wryly funny like `Doonesbury'. The only character in the movie for which I had any sympathy at all was the news director played by Fred Willard. Ferrell's foil, the female newscaster played by Christina Applegate was too predictable and unnatural to elicit much empathy from me, especially since her competition was so artificial.<br /><br />If a movie is good, I typically rate DVDs on the basis of the quality of the bonus features. This is why a Kevin Smith DVD is such a good bargain compared to even great classic comedy DVDs such as `Ghostbusters' or `Some Like It Hot'. If the principals are not around to provide a good commentary, the rewatchability drops a bit. But this movie is not entertaining to begin with, so what interest do I have in listening to a commentary of why they decided to punt a dog dummy off the San Diego bridge.<br /><br />This movie may be worth a rent, but not a buy.get a laugh out of you by hook or by crook. <br /> <br />There are many ways in which this is not a really bad movie.

0064471837|2.0|This book was exactly what i expected it to be: Another blah fantasy book. It had almost no character development, so the characters were all one-dimensional. Especially Touchstone, I couldn't even imagine him as a real person. I felt absolutly no attachment to Sabriel, and had difficulty remembering she was female. There were some good opportunities for interesting internal conflicts (like the relationship between Touchstone and Rogir), that were glossed over or completely bypassed.<br /><br />The magic had a few creative elements, but often fell to cliches. Like a previous reviewer, this book reminded me of a video game. See monster, fight monster, go somewhere else, oh no there is another monster, fight that monster, etc. There was no explination as to why the dead don't like the living, apparently being dead just automtically made them bad people, and so they went around killing people. You could tell that, in the hands of a capable author, this book could have been amazingly good. However, it fell short.<br /><br />The reason i didnt give this one star, is that it actually carried your interest by sheer force of plot. There was enough action going on (See monster, fight monster...) that I almost enjoyed reading it. almost.<br /><br />I came away from this book entertained, but not moved intellectually, spiritually, or emotionally. It didnt teach any life lessons (or any lessons at all), didnt show me a new perspective on life, help me understand a new character, didn't make me laugh, cry, or feel any emotion but some suspense (there would have been much more if i had cared what happened to the characters).<br /><br />So, another blah fantasy book. If you like magic and action and don't care that the book you are reading is trash, read on.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|What can I say that no one else has? Nothing really, but in my opinion I loved Karate Kid Part 2 the most. Don't get me wrong though I thoroughly loved Karate Kid Part 1...I mean that was how it started.<br /><br /> You know, single mother; who is struggling to make ends meat, just moved from Jersey to Cali (huge move, and very different in culture) a son who is paltry, very street looking, has the hots for ultra cute rich girl with vindictive ex-boyfriend. Son meets old asian man who teachs him Karate to defend himself so he wins girl, wins Karate tournament, wnis our hearts. And why not?<br /><br />We all get tired of not hearing that the good guy underdog won everything.<br /><br /> But in Part 2 it is not just about old style fight for the girl style Martial Arts. In Part 1 Mr. Miyagi explains that Karate helps train you for life, and in Part 2 it is about how Daniel has to deal with Mr. Miyagi's troubled past, coming to grips with his breakup with his girlfriend and his own fight for life, and how he can do this and not lose his life.<br /><br /> He fights for honor now, not for a trophy, and that is the message. Life is not all about bullies and girlfriends, it is about love for friends, sacrifice, and the next phase of life.<br /><br />Oh yeah there is something about a Part 3 and a Part 4 but those one's don't really count...DO THEY?

B000005IS1|5.0|Sorry to start off with a Wailers quote, but it's apropos. I just can't help feeling that somewhere out there in Elektra's forgotten tapes basement, there's the rest of this set, since it isn't complete. From what I have heard over the years, there are either three or four more songs that were recorded during the gig. Maybe Elektra figured, correctly, that AMERICA WASN'T READY FOR THIS, which it really isn't now either. The drive, power and obvious commitment to the music these guys present would make a whole album of Louie, Louie covers sound better than 98% of all the rock and roll ever recorded. The CD has marginally cleaner sound than my well-kept vinyl version, and thankfully the John Sinclair speech isn't the \\"clean\\" version that Elektra went back and issued when they figured out that most radio stations wouldn't play a song that starts \\"KICK OUT THE JAMS MOTHERF***ERS!\\". This was the first rock album in history ever released simultaneously in \\"clean\\" and \\"dirty\\" versions, please note. <br /> <br />It's an incredible recording. Timeless. And it'll put Linkin Park in perspective for any young listener as well. God bless the memory of Rockin' Rob and Sonic!
B0007GADZO|3.0|To me there are two (2) Steve Vais...<br /><br />There is the Steve Vai we hear on more traditional rock type projects like \\"Juice\\", \\"The Audience is Listening\\", work with David Lee Roth, \\"Yankee Rose\\", \\"Tobacco Road\\", Whitesnake, movie Crossroads, etc..etc..<br /><br />Then there is the Steve Vai who was heavily influenced by Zappa and other \\"jazzy/fusion\\" like artists.<br /><br />\\"Little Green Men\\", \\"Catch the Man with the Ball\\", \\"Ya-yo Gak\\", etc..<br /><br />After giving away 1/2 of my Steve Vai albums after I buy them, I have finally come to the realization that I am not a big fan of Vai's more \\"out there\\" material with the weird sound effects, and other goofy \\"Little Green Men\\" type of material.<br /><br />Do not get me wrong... Steve is EXTEMELY talented and a Master of what he does..... but much of his stranger material is an acquired taste.<br /><br />To me it is sort of like free form Jazz.... you have all the respect in the world for the people's music skills yet 10 minutes after listening to them play you can't remember anything you heard nor do you have a strong desire to listen to it again.<br /><br />There is no \\"hook\\".<br /><br />For me this Vai album fits into that \\"more out there\\" style of experimentation and sound effects that Vai often leans towards.<br /><br />After 2 listens, I gave it away the same day I received it.<br /><br />It is the work of a master musician and guitarist, but not something that \\"hooks\\" me and makes me want to listen again and again.<br /><br />If you like Vai the \\"rocker\\", you may be like me and find this album complex, masterful and worthy of respect but unappealing for repeated listening enjoyment.<br /><br />On the otherhand if you like the weird sounds, heavy lydian and related modal playing, harmonized and synthetic guitar tone and the \\"Zappa-like\\" weirdness of much of Steve's work.... you will LOVE this album.<br /><br />Again I must stress, one can't honestly criticize Steve Vai's ability... he is a true master at what he does much like Yngwie Malmsteen, Paul Gilbert, etc...<br /><br />It is simply a matter of taste and what \\"grabs\\" you and makes you come back to an album time and time again.<br /><br />Some people love Mozart but find Bach boring.<br /><br />Considering the guitarists mentioned above (Paul Gilbert, Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Vai) for example...<br /><br />Each is a master of a different trademark style, but I find myself listening to Gilbert and Malmsteen more often than many of Vai's albums.<br /><br />The exception being \\"Passion & Warfare\\" and Steve's work with Roth/Whitesnake.r at what he does much like Yngwie Malmsteen, Paul Gilbert, etc... <br /> <br />It is simply a matter of taste and what \\"grabs\\" you and makes you come back to an album time and time again. <br /> <br />Some people love Mozart but find Bach boring. <br /> <br />Considering the guitarists mentioned above (Paul Gilbert, Yngwie Malmsteen, Steve Vai) for example... <br />Each is a master of a different trademark style, but I find myself listening to Gilbert and Malmsteen more often than many of Vai's albums. <br />The exception being \\"Passion & Warfare\\" and Steve's work with Roth/Whitesnake.
068987474X|3.0|I enjoyed this book.  However, honestly, it's really just a repackage of what \\"The Rules\\" told us in the 90s.  I'd reccomend \\"The Rules\\" as a great companion to this book, because if you do them, you won't end up in the messes this book describes in the first place!
B000001E8S|4.0|Being an Eno fan, and not so much of a U2 fan, this album proves that with the production of a genius(Eno), U2 can be a great artistic band. However, there are at least two songs on \\"Passengers\\" that are ACTUALLY IN A MOVIE! The movie is called, \\"Beyond the Clouds,\\" a foreign film of shorts directed by John Malkovitch. The short within the movie, \\"Par-Dela Les Nuages,\\" (which also stars Malkovitch) has two tracks off of this album, \\"Beach Sequence,\\" and \\"Your Blue Room.\\" The movie was relased in 1995, the same year as \\"Passengers.\\"  So, to correct some people who think that this is an \\"imaginary\\" soundtrack album, that is not altogether true.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|don't listen to these whiners, the same thing happened with the star wars: special editions as well as blade runner among other things. fan uproar. get your panties in a bunch, why doncha!<br /><br />truth is this is the director's original vision, it brings things into much more clarity while still remaining very ambiguous. the changes are so subtle that unless you were a die-hard fan you won't notice (or care).<br /><br />the director's cut is certainly not a smarter or dumber movie, the pacing is a little more relaxed (which is a good thing!!!) and the effects are a little touched up. big deal. this is still, if barely, a superior version.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Deadpan comedies often become underground cult favorites, panned by most critics but loved by most audiences, and this is true with the deadest of all deadpan-ers Napoleon Dynamite.  An Idahoan myself, I left the theater mixed between utter embarrassment at my state and humorous at how stupid but charming ND ended up being.  Starring child star Tina Majorino in the role of Deb, the quiet keep-to-herself girl that befriends Napoleon and eventually becomes his secret flame, and Hilary Duff's sister Haylie, Napoleon Dynamite has a plot that is as scant as Britney Spears' wardrobe, but nonetheless it remains an entertaining piece of fluff.  If you enjoy stupid movies then Napoleon is for you; if not, then avoid this movie.
B0000009SY|5.0|Love this album. This is one where you have to sit down and listen to the whole thing, not just a couple of songs. A timeless and seductive masterpiece. The music industry desperately needs musicians like Frank Zappa today. Unfortunately we are trapped in a corporate world.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|I cannot even begin to explain how much I love Everwood. Everwood is real and while watching it, I often find myself pulled in and routing for Ephram and Amy and all of the other characters.

B00006GA4C|5.0|About \\"Grand Funk\\" (AKA: \\"The Red Album\\"):<br /><br />Vintage Grand Funk Railroad sound! This record is what defined the Grand Funk Railroad power-sound. ALL of their other records are compared to this release. It gave early heavy metal fans what they wanted. It gave people into funk and soul what they wanted. It gave the politically astute what they wanted. It satisfies the nihilists. There were elements the bubblegum squad could latch on to. It was a huge sound without the haughty, \\"Creamish\\" air attached. Simple, but very, very effective! This is the core sound--devoid of any clich&eacute; slickness that is duck taped to all-too-many rock recordings. However, GFR didn't seem to strive to achieve this sound; it simply WAS their sound! Everything sounds natural and unpretentious. Mel Schacher says on the liner notes, \\"I liked the RED ALBUM the best, because I think it represented what Grand Funk was really all about, musically.\\"<br /><br />About the \\"Grand Funk Remasters\\":<br /><br />First of all, what took so freakin' long to release these records in this format? Why do we have to listen to crappy sounding CDs in this day and age? As Nathan (William Snape) says in \\"The Full Monty\\" during one his dad's (Robert Carlyle) clumsy dance rehearsals--\\"that were crap!\\" Even the Beatles catalog is taking forever to get released on quality CDs! (\\"The Capital Albums Vol. 1\\") Oh well, better late than never, I guess! I just have one last thing to say to the record companies, et al involved concerning this faux pas; guess which finger I'm holding up!<br /><br />There's a world of difference between the sound of these CDs and the sterile sounding earlier digital releases of the same material; that fact alone justifies buying the remasters. However, the bonus music on these CDs makes them a must-buy for anyone who likes Grand Funk.
B000005J56|3.0|oh WHY did you do this?  Who flies all the way to cuba, tracks down some great musicians, makes a fantastic documentary about cuban music, then plays incongruous guitar parts all over their work on the soundtrack album? <br /> <br />Chan Chan is a wonderful piece of music, well rendered, with a bizarra addition of a blues slide guitar on it... oo I wonder WHO could've been the culprit.  Whoever that guitarist is, he musta been friendly with the producer to get THAT onto the track... <br /> <br />Track 2 I thought had escaped his attention until on the second listen I hear tuneless twanging of the parts of the guitar strings the wrong side of the neck or nut.  Clearly TRYing to sound like a cowbell, and doing a reasonable job.  They sound a lot like a cowbell being played by someone who's not played a cowbell much before.  Even more, they sound like a pasty white guy trying to get in on the party with these consummate cubanos. <br /> <br />Gah. That's enough for now.  I'm off to listen to some nuyorican  <br />mambo to cool down.

B000002MP2|5.0|Man, when I first saw the videos for longview and basketcase on TV I was astonished.  I had to find out who that band was.  I purchased dookie and I must've listened to that album (from beginning to end) at least 100 times.  I haven't listened to it in years (since high school in the early 90's), but even if I were to pick it up today I would still know all the lyrics, and my feelings for that album would not change.  Excellent, excellent album.  Great beats, great lyrics and simply put, GREAT MUSIC.
B000050HTO|5.0|Right before I went away for my first semester as a college freshman (August 2004), I was shopping at Target (definitely not my favorite place to buy music). Some of my friends had been telling me for years that Bob Dylan had a lot of music and albums that I'd like, but I'd never bought any of Dylan's stuff. That all changed that day when I picked up the Essential Bob Dylan. <br /> <br />To put it quite simply, Essential is probably the best complilation that I have bought with respect to the release of an artists' greatest songs. Essential's first disc starts with one of Dylan's many renowned songs, \\"Blowin' In The Wind,\\" and has several of his great songs, including \\"The Times They Are A-Changin',\\" \\"Maggie's Farm,\\" \\"Mr. Tambourine Man,\\" \\"Like A Rolling Stone,\\" and  \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35,\\" among others. It's a very strong disc that got a lot of play on both my CD player and my iPod. <br /> <br />Disc 2 is also very strong, consisting, obviously, of Dylan's later work. Leading off with the serenating \\"Lay, Lady, Lay,\\" the disc consists of songs that illustrate's Dylan's sheer brilliance with regards to writing lyrics and poetry. Tracks such as \\"Knockin' On Heaven's Door,\\" \\"Tangled Up In Blue,\\" \\"Shelter From The Storm,\\" \\"Hurricane,\\" and \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\" contribute to yet another strong disc. Disc 2 concludes with a punch, as a later Dylan song, \\"Things Have Changed,\\" brings an appropriate closing to the disc. <br /> <br />For me, this disc served as both a great intro to Dylan and a marking point in my musical interests. Since purchasing the Essential Bob Dylan, I have bought the following Dylan albums (all within a five-month span and, also, with great deals from my independent, local music store): The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan, The Times They Are A-Changin', Another Side of Bob Dylan, Bringing It All Back Home, Highway 61 Revisited, Blonde on Blonde, Nashville Skyline, Blood On The Tracks, Desire, Oh Mercy, and Time Out of Mind. Very good albums. <br /> <br/>Even if you don't think you'll become as big of a Dylan fan as I've become, do yourself a favor and pick up this collection of great songs. I think - and hope - that you'll find a great bunch of songs that cover a variety of topics.
B0006SSOHM|5.0|For those of us who are tired the masked killer running around with a knife only to turn out to be an everyday teenager, you will be glad to see Saw. This movie is classified as a \\"horror\\" movie but it is very very intense as well. There is no one running up stairs instead of out of the front door type of situations, only those who keep you on the edge of your seat. There have been many complaints on the acting, yes, some is a bit exaggerated but you can't help to think about what you would look like if you were in that situation.   I was very impressed with the plot, considering most horror movies forget to add those in the mix of blood shed and screams. The movie will definitely leave you guessing and your heart racing. Don't be fooled by the room they are locked in, the entertainment value is ten times greater than when Tom Hanks got deserted on an island (Cast Away) and scuba divers got left in the ocean (Open Water).  Overall this is one of the best horror movies I have seen. I believe it opens up a whole new world of opportunity for movies that can get to their viewer mentally. The scariest thing of all in this movie is that it can actually happen, unlike Jason coming back over and over. And if you have trouble sleeping after a horror movie, watch this in pure daylight, because you'll be afraid to go to sleep in fear of where you might wake up. See Saw.
B0006399FS|1.0|We hate this half-worked album because it's so ordinary, cheesy, artificial, commercial, lazy, cheap, easy, mainstream, filler, predictable, canned, recycled, dull and totally devoid of groundbreaking ideas.  <br />We love complicated U2 albums as Achtung Baby, Zooropa and Pop. <br /> <br />When someone asked why Bono's singing of the line 'Tonight thank God's its them instead of you' in the new version of Band Aid's Do They Know It's Christmas was so lame and weak compared to his original (1984) singing, he said \\"I thought that considering all the people dying everywhere in the world, it wasn't time for a roar, but for a whimper, a whimper for the dying\\" !  <br /> <br />He is just as conformist as some fans who run to the nearest music store to buy any new U2 stuff as soon as possible. Stupidity  <br /> <br />
B00008DDXC|4.0|Chris Columbus has done it again! The Chamber of Secrets is even better than its predecessor. It has more humor and action than before. The music captures the moment in almost every scene. The basilisk and Fawkes look absolutely real and the visuals have improved. The Quidditch match is action-packed and the scene in which Harry fights the basilisk is thrilling. I have nothing negative to say. I simply love this film.
B00005N83M|1.0|J. Lo has a real nice backside, but too bad the diameter of her buttocks can never compare to the range of her voice. Lets look at simple logistics, her alto-falsetto wailing or as I think of it \\"Moaning\\" would best be served in the bedroom. Just because she grew up in Brooklyn doesn't automatically make her a ghetto super-star, look at Yanni. Born and raised in Kalamata, Greece Yanni knows the street life and was even in a gang. Yanni had to work to put food in his table, not shake his rump and watch the moolah fly in. The worst part of this album is not only does it promote racism, J. Lo speaks in jibberish most of the album. It is in her made up language that she dubbed \\"Spanish\\". Now, any educated man will be able to tell that she is merely singing made up words because she does not possess the intellectual capacity to write any lyrics of her own. I bet she owns a slave and sticks her backside in the slaves face and forces him to write her made up langauge or just smell her bum all day. Come on J. Lo, this is the 21st Century. Stop living like its 1979.
B00003CXI1|4.0|I love this movie! Chris Columbus did an excellent job directing it and was able to capture the spirit of the book. He really spiced up the Quidditch match by adding some exciting scenes and good computer graphics. John Williams composed good music that you just don't get tired of hearing. Richard Harris plays the part of Professor Dumbledore perfectly. He has a look in his eyes just like Dumbledore has in the book. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint make a great trio and each performs the character's part well. I was a bit disappointed with Hogwarts because it didn't look entirely realistic. Even if you haven't read the book you can still easily follow the plot. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone is a movie I am sure anyone would enjoy, fan or not.
B000002JS6|4.0|I've thought I've liked this album, and it's gotten so much better and I like it a lot. It's got some great songs on it. <br />It's an awesome CD!!  <br /> <br />1. Hells Bells-Those bells are cool then Angus coming up to play. <br />Those Young brothers do pretty excellent job on this song. <br /> <br />2. Shoot To Thrill-This is one of my favorite songs on this album. Brian's vocals are better in this track. Angus at a perfect riff. <br /> <br />3. What Do You Do For Money Honey-Not sure about this track but <br />it's okay. <br /> <br />4. Given The Dog A Bone-This song is awesome! It's great to bang <br />your head in. Powerfull, in the beginning. <br /> <br />5. Let Me Put My Love Into You-Not really that great. <br /> <br />6. Back in Black-The riffs are great in this song. Classic, and <br />great fade out ending.  <br /> <br />7. You Shook Me All Night Long-Possibly the album's best, great <br />riff, Brian at his best on vocals and drums rule from Phillip Rudd.  <br /> <br />8. Have a Drink On Me-Yep this is another great song! Excellent <br />vocals by Brian, Angus even better. One of the best on this album. <br /> <br />9. Shake A Leg-Don't really care about this song. <br /> <br />10. Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution-Pollution? What is that. <br />It's good to open up but closes not much better. Oh well. <br /> <br />This and Highway to Hell match your best guess. <br /> <br />
B00006690G|5.0|For awhile I thought Rap was gettin' old. None of the guys had anything to say anymore, they were just talkin' junk. Eminem proved me wrong. This cat is great. He truely uses the music as a mode of self expression, not to just get buck. I'm kinda getting sick of these groups protesting him, tryin' to shut 'em up, saying he's corrupting young kids with hate speech. Newsflash, there is a lot more things screwing up kids than one mans rap album. 2. nobody is forcing you to listen to 'em. And I'm sure he doesn't care whether people like him or not. As long as he gets his message across. He's brough the art back to the genre for me! Plus, I like guys who understand the art of sarcasim. So America, Let the man speak!
B000002UBB|4.0|Pretty good. It has at least Rock n me, and Take the Money & Run. <br />It's sure Steve Miller's second best to Book of Dreams. I would <br />like to try it out some time.
B00000J7S8|4.0|I didn't think of Diana Krall as someone that I or anyone would wanna listen to. She too much Jazz for the mainstream pop audience, but shes playing it too lightly for Jazz fans. But she's got it. To my surprise she is really popular( for a pure jazz singer pianist) and her playing is quite good. She's got the chops as we say in the Jazz field. She's sultry, almost erotic if you ask me. She has the voice of a true Jazz singer, mellow, calming, relaxing, soothing, you name it. This is SMOOTH JAZZ, not that crap that Kenny G regurgetates from his poor saxophone. Is it the best, No. Ella Fitgearld, Billy Holiday, and ofcouse the immortal Sarah Vaughan. But she's got enough to hold her own along sidw some of the other great Jazz singers. Certainly one of the better singers of today, one who pays attention to the music and makes it do what it does.
B000002OX7|5.0|This album is the Who at their best. Baba O' Riley, & Won't Get <br />Fooled Again are at their best, with some other greats such as <br />Bargain, Love aint for Keeping, Behind Blue Eyes, & More. This is <br />your best startout if you're new to the who.
0385512058|5.0|While completing my MBA at NYU's Stern School of Business, I accepted a graduate internship with Deloitte Consulting's thought-leadership group, Deloitte Research.  The group fell under the leadership of author Keith Ferrazzi who was serving as Deloitte's chief marketing officer.   While I had lost touch with Keith over the years (clearly violating one of his central tenants), I have followed his career at Starwood, YaYa, and, eventually, Ferrazzi Greenlight through the media.   With a little effort (and luck), I was fortunate enough to obtain an advance copy of his book which I quickly read and have, hopefully, taken to heart.   <br /> <br />\\"Never Eat Alone\\" is a terrific guide to building and nurturing value-added relationships.  The book combines tangible suggestions for improvement with reinforcing and inspirational stories of Keith's own experiences.   As a member of Keith's team, I had the opportunity to closely observe his marketing and brand management principles as he applied them to both Deloitte and himself.   In fact, on several occasions, Keith had me prepare 1-2 page briefings on many of the people and companies he met with during his time at DC - an activity that is an important part of his relationship building strategy as outlined within his book, \\"Never Eat Alone.\\"  As a result of this experience and having read his book, I recognize the importance and impact of Keith's advice.  In several respects, it is much better than many of the highly acclaimed networking and relationship books such as Harvey Mackay's fine \\"Dig Your Well Before You're Thirsty.\\"  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in discovering the power of relationships.  Overall rating: \\"A.\\" <br />
B0000TLA9G|5.0|This compilation is really great!! But where is Mr. Brownstone? <br />That's one of my favorite songs and that needs to be on this compilation. But the rest however, fit. Somehow there is a bad <br />Rolling Stones cover, Sympathy for the Devil. Now I'll review all <br />the songs on this album. <br /> <br />1. Welcome to the Jungle-Great opening song, Slash has amazing <br />solo in this one, and drums rock!!!  <br /> <br />2. Sweet Child O' Mine-What can i say? This is the greatest GNR <br />song ever recorded, it is typically a must have for any GNR compilation. Slash's solo is so amazing and Axl rules on the vocals, probably the best on the album. <br /> <br />3. Patience-First of all it's slow, but it is nice to calm down. <br />This doesn't seem like a GNR song that I would cover but still <br />good. <br /> <br />4. Paradise City-Another awesome song! The opening part is great <br />but the ending goes fast. Another listen to over n over gain! <br /> <br />5. Knockin' on Heaven's Door-Matt's drums have typically been <br />like an Appetite sort of drums, but some how around 4 minutes <br />I would rather skip it because it gets boring fast.  <br /> <br />6. Civil War-This is marginally much better than Knockin' on Heaven's Door, it's very true and is about a war.  <br /> <br />7. You Could Be Mine-Heavy metal back in this song, this song is <br />one of my favorites! But you do get the feeling of Welcome to the <br />Jungle. <br /> <br />8. Don't Cry-This song is muchly the weakest song on the entire <br />compilation.  <br /> <br />9. November Rain-I absolutely love this song! This is the greatest song on this compilation, ever!!! Slash at his best. Axl <br />is great on vocals. Go buy this album for this song. The ending <br />is the best ever!! <br /> <br />10. Live and Let Die-Okay, after the great November Rain, this <br />song is another great song in addtion. Axl does great vocals on <br />this one. It's a Paul McCartney cover. <br /> <br />11. Yesterdays-Could be better. <br /> <br />12. Ain't it Fun-Ouch! I never like this song, this song sucks <br />the most, bad vocals bad music!! Hate it never choose to listen <br />to this song!! at all. It's not like GNR at all. <br /> <br />13. Since I Don't Have You-This was better but not as great as <br />the rest.  <br /> <br />14. Sympathy For The Devil-Skip it, i hate this song. <br /> <br />Go ahead, buy this compilation and Appetite for Destruction <br />to get this and Mr. Brownstone.
B000002UB3|5.0|Abbey Road is one of the most fantastic achievements in the history of rock. It is that good. Just one thing though.....Maxwells Silver Hammer should have came down on Paul before he put it on the album. Sorry Paul...I love you dude... and I don't love dudes.
B0000029AP|4.0|Toys in the Attic is actully one of my favorite Aerosmith albums <br />of all time. Like I said before, I would get this in addition to <br />Get Your Wings, & Permanent Vacation. My favorites on this are <br />2 of the bands biggest hits, Walk This Way & Sweet Emotion. Fun <br />headbangers.
0375757260|5.0|Greed, gold-digging and deception sit at the heart of \\"Vanity Fair.\\" It's no joke that it's subtitled \\"a novel without a hero\\" -- William Makepeace Thackeray mercilessly skewered the pretentions and flaws of the upper class all throughout it. The result is a gloriously witty social satire.<br /><br />It opens with two young women departing from a ladies' academy: dull, sweet Amelia (rich) and fiery sharp-witted Rebecca (poor). Becky Sharp is a relentless social climber, and her first effort to rise \\"above her station\\" is by trying to get Amelia's brother to marry her -- an effort thwarted by Amelia's fiancee. So instead she gets married to another family's second son, Rawdon Crawley.<br /><br />Unfortunately, both young couples quickly get disinherited and George is killed. But Becky is determined to live the good life she has worked and married for -- she obtains jewels and money from admiring gentlemen, disrupting her marriage. But a little thing like a tarnished reputation isn't enough to keep Becky down...<br /><br />\\"Vanity Fair\\" is actually a lot more complex than that, with dozens of little subplots and complicated character relationships. Reading it a few times is necessary to really absorb all of it, since it is not just a look at the two women in the middle of the book, but at the upper (and sometimes lower) social strata of the nineteenth century.<br /><br />The main flaw of the book is perhaps that it sprawls too much -- there's always a lot of stuff going on, not to mention a huge cast of characters, and Thackeray sometimes drops the ball when it comes to the supporting characters and their little plots. It takes a lot of patience to absorb all of this. However... it's worth it.<br /><br />Like most nineteenth-century writers, Thackeray had a very dense, formal writing style -- but once you get used to it, his writing becomes insanely funny. Witticisms and quips litter the pages, even if you don't pick them all up at once. At first Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.<br /><br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her. Certainly life hasn't been fair for her. Next to Becky, a goody-goody character like Amelia is pretty boring, and even the unsubtle George can't measure up to Becky.<br /><br />To sum up \\"Vanity Fair\\": think a period soap opera with a heavy dose of social commentary. In other words, it doesn't get much better than this, Thackeray's masterpiece.Thackeray seems incredibly cynical (Becky's little schemes almost always pay off), but taken as a social satire, it's easier to understand why he was so cynical about the society of the time.   <br />  <br />Becky Sharp is the quintessential anti-heroine -- she's very greedy and cold, yet she's also so smart and determined that it's hard not to have a grudging liking for her.

B000003TA4|5.0|I say this is the best darn Nirvana album ever came out!! Smells <br />Like Teen Spirit, Lithium, In Bloom, Breed, & Come As You Are are <br />my favorite tracks on this album. Smells Like Teen Spirit, & Lithium are tracks I could play over n over again, especially that YEAH! chant in Smells Like Teen Spirit. Kurt Cobain is really cool and is one of my favorite albums of all time.
B000002J2B|4.0|I liked A Trick of the Tail very much though Gabriel wasn't singing on that album. Collins' voice wasn't horrible and Banks keyboards sounded beautiful.<br /><br />Wind&Wuthering was Genesis' last studio album with Steve Hackett. You can hear that his quitar is magnifiquant sharp on this cd. Especially Unquiet Slumbers For The Sleepers...  and ...In That Quiet Earth songs shows his quitar playing talents.  Tony Banks is one of the most unknown keyboard players ever. Sad but true but hardly no one remerber him because he was so long only one member of Genesis. Like Gabriel and Collins he could't create  his own succesful era outside Genesis. Luckily, we can hear Banks' masterious keyboards playing also Wind&Wuthering album. Elevent Earl of Mar and One for the One are great excemples for his sense of good melody. One for the Vine has put full of interesting, surprising and terrific sounds. My favourites are middle part that reminds me circus show and closing section in which Banks plays quickly.<br /><br />Collins does his job well and I am not going say anything bad about his voice. He sings tenderly!<br /><br />Wind&Wuthering has many great moments but it loses the killer touch. Your Own Special Way and Wot Gorilla are far away for Genesis' best songs. There are also too much ballads that makes whole album a little bit booring.<br /><br />All In A Mouse's Night shows that Genesis' could make funny stories without Gabriel.<br /><br />Finally, this album is Genesis' proge testament and you should listen to this. Hopefully, new listeners find also proge Genesis with help of new collection(Platinum Collection) Wind&Wuthering is a good album  start to explore Genesis' proge era.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|In my opinion, this is Dire Straits' best album. I add both Appetite for Destruction, and Sultans of Swing/The Very Best of <br />Dire Straits in addition to this album. This album came out the <br />year I was born. Brothers in Arms is also good too but this is <br />probably better. Let me now review my favorite songs on this album.  <br /> <br />1. Calling Elvis-Now this version is 6 minutes and I can listen <br />to it!! Mark's vocals have a true ring to this one.  <br /> <br />2. On Every Street-This version is marginally better since it is <br />5 minutes. Like i said, calm song to listen to, and then gets up <br />to Heavy Fuel rock n roll at the end. <br /> <br />3. When It Comes To You-Sort of country type of song, but its still really cool! <br /> <br />5. The Bug-Really a fast song that you could play over n over again. It's creative and fun to listen to. <br /> <br />7. Heavy Fuel-This is the best intro on this whole album. Clocking in at around 5:10, while this version is even better. <br />Typically heavy metal style song followed up to one of the best <br />hard rock songs ever did by Dire Straits. Mark Knopfler did his <br />best on vocals, and drums rule. Marginally this is my favorite song on the whole album, and it's the best on the entire album. <br /> <br />Great cd, get it.
0385510454|4.0|A Washington power broker is incarcerated and his subsequent pardon by a lame duck President is the subject of a new Grisham novel that focuses on ethics and morality in government. The competing interests of the CIA, FBI and White House result in strategies that may be a bit predictable but are, nevertheless, exciting and entertaining. In suspenseful fashion that is a Grisham hallmark, the author leaves us with a compelling question: Who is running our country?
B00000DGUY|5.0|This album is so awesome, I own two great copies of this album. <br />I have my own, and bob has one too!! Now I will review all of the <br />songs on this great album. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />1. Sultans of Swing-Great album opener with Mark's best ending. <br /> <br />2. Lady Writer-This is also good too, Mark's crazy guitar and vocals are amazing.  <br /> <br />3. Romeo and Juliet-No worries about this track. <br /> <br />4. Tunnel of Love-This is one of my favorite Dire Straits songs <br />ever came out, over 8 minutes of great excellence, and is a track <br />i can listen to over n over again. Another song to sing along with \\"On the tunnel of love\\". Great song. <br /> <br />5. Private Investigations-Skip it, no worries. <br /> <br />6. Twisting by the Pool-Great surf rock song, this song goes even <br />better by the beach with \\"Twisting by the pool\\". Is another song <br />you can listen to over n over again but it's not one of my favorites. But it's still really good. <br /> <br />7. Love over Gold-Skip it, this is live. <br /> <br />8. So Far Away-Mark at his best. I say this song was my Peoria, IL song because I was so far away from my family.  <br /> <br />9. Money For Nothing-What a great intro, typically one of my favorite Dire Straits songs next to Sultans of Swing, Tunnel of <br />Love, & Heavy Fuel. Mark does great guitars, drums exellent and <br />vocals rule!! This version is even better since it is 4 insted <br />of the Brothers in Arms version 8 minutes. This is also another <br />track I can listen to over n over again.  <br /> <br />10. Brothers in Arms-This track felt to slow for me, most people <br />like it but others like me don't. <br /> <br />11. Walk of Life-Oops, the electric organ. This song is such not <br />that great because of the organ. Where is that Mark guitar? This <br />is not like Dire Straits at all.  <br /> <br />12. Calling Elvis-The six minute version of this song is slightly <br />better. This version is near 5 minutes but it's still pretty good.  <br /> <br />13. Heavy Fuel-Wow! This is the best song Mark Knopfler ever did! <br />His guitar is typically heavy metal, and is typically a hard rock <br />song and his solo rules!!! This is my favorite song on the whole <br />album.  <br /> <br />14. On Every Street-Change to the version at 5 minutes to get this song on the run. I muchly listen to both Calling Elvis, & <br />this song on the other album, \\"On Every Street\\". Nice calm song <br />to listen to before the hard Heavy Fuel type rock n roll comes <br />up around 3 in a half minutes with a great rock n roll ending. <br /> <br />Great album. <br />Love it!!! <br />You need this album.
B00007L4OM|4.0|A fun action ride with some very funny moments. Jean Reno is a wonderful actor. Momo makes for a great sidekick. Contains elements and similarities to films like The Transporter and Leon (The Professional).  If you like fun, don't take too serious, in your face, action movies.......this is for you.
B00006J3T4|5.0|Coyote is the best song I have ever heard from MK. It simply is <br />the best song on the entire album, typically the horns are my favorite in that song. That is a track I could play over n over <br />again. Great song. One of my favorite songs of all time. I also <br />call it \\"The Desert Song\\", because It's great for the Desert.
B00005JMAH|5.0|There seems little point in me writing a synopsis - or indeed, telling you about the film itself. Chances are you've already seen it, as this was one of the most popular films of 2004.  Some think this the best of the 3 HP films so far - others think it a disappointment. I liked it - but didn't entirely like the new layout of Hogwarts, as this seemed to jar when so much effort has been put into seamless continuity from one film to the next.  <br /> <br />In this case, the DVD extras are nicely done, but pretty standard. However, for fans of Harry Potter, the interview with J K Rowling offers a tantalizing hint at a possible future plotline. She comments that the film includes something NOT in the book - and yet, it is spookily close to something yet to be revealed in a forthcoming book. Interesting! Especially interesting as much of the film is so very closely adapted.  <br /> <br />My personal theory is that she was referring to the dialogue between Harry and Professor Lupin, in which Lupin infers that he and Lily might have been 'close' before she married James.  <br />Anyway, buy the DVD, watch the interview and re-watch the film ... and see what you think JK is referring to! <br />
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is a well crafted and intriguing story set in a seemingly idyllic setting. The setting of the novel is what essentially arouses the main themes of the novel. Themes include conformity, a communistic style of living, and loss of innocence. The main character Jonas struggles with his identity as a member of his community. This struggle is won by his loss of innocence. As the Receiver his newly found high status comes with a price. His price is his naivety of the situation he lives in. The book is a man vs. himself conflict. Jonas can either live in ignorance, or understand and be in pain. This novel is poignant, and goes much farther beyond being a children's novel.
B00008WG3U|5.0|\\"Punk Rock? Yea right. This band sucks just as much as any pop-punk band out there.\\" <br /> <br />You've got to be kidding right, do you listen to the radio and hear all the crap they play nowadays? <br /> <br />\\"With crappy vocals,guitars and lyrics it was hard for me to catch the real meaning behind this album, but oh let me guess, it was about hating Bush and all those other trends in supposed \\"punk-rock\\" nowadays. Now I am extremely Liberal and I have nothing wrong with the messages most punk rockers send through their music. Maybe if NOFX tried writing some meaningful lyrics that actually made sence, i would give them a try.\\" <br /> <br />This blathering just makes you sound like a complete tool.  NOFX does write meaningful lyrics, and it is hardly the trendy thing for them to do.  If you had any idea of the type of songs they've written for the past 20 YEARS you'd have a semblence of what they're about.  But you don't, so you can't make a valid comment here. <br /> <br /> <br />\\"All I heard was him singing about getting \\"A$$ F**ked. I highly recommend Anti-Flag instead. Now there's a band who can create real messages through their songs.\\" <br /> <br />If you asked Anti-Flag they'd tell you they wished they were half as successful as NOFX.  They are nothing compared to them.
B000000OSG|5.0|Civil War - One of Gn'Rs' best songs, and most powerful. Somehow, it seems rather ironic (and even humorous and slightly laughable) that Axl is trying to tell us the dangers of war, and the beauracratic corruptness, and asking us what is civil about war, and why we can't live in peace, etc., when he himself starts a riot in St. Louis and, at the time, is known for regularly attempting to beat up fans/listeners who yell at him during performances, or throw things, or take his picture. I am not an Axl hater by any means, but even I have to crack a smile sometimes at the irony of this song. Still, the lyrics and music are both very powerful and the guitar solo is amazing. <br /> <br />14 Years - Another great song, this one sung by Izzy Stradlin (with a chorus by Axl) and it's really fantastic. A new favorite of mine after only hearing it for the first time ever very recently. <br /> <br />Yesterdays - This will always be one of my top five favorite Gn'R songs. The lyrics are good but the beat is really upbeat and catchy and moving, more so than anything else. Axl's singing is very good, although there is one point during the song where I think his voice breaks just a bit too much and he seems to be croaking rather than singing. Considering Gn'R broke up soon after this, with Izzy leaving the band almost immediately thereafter, it holds an even greater value now, especially when you watch the music video, which is an eerie look back on the band's history -- as if they're saying a final farewell. Powerful, and not a second too short or too long - just the right length. <br /> <br />Knockin' On Heaven's Door - Superior to every other version of the song, it became Gn'Rs' trademark on the Illusion world tour. It's more powerful than Dylan's acoustic sleepie version (and by \\"sleepie,\\" I mean his puts me to sleep). This is one of the best Gn'R songs ever. <br /> <br />Get in the Ring - Most people hate this egotistical public rant, an airing of dirty laundry on Axl's behalf, in which he venomously launches a personal attack against journalists who have \\"lied\\" about him to his fans. Swearing is frequent, sexual references even more so. Still, until Axl goes into his little rant 3/4 of the way through, it's a great song - Slash's opening guitar intro is very Aerosmith-y and blues-y, with a catchy beat. Call me insane: I really like it, and it's one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Shotgun Blues - Inexcusable. This should have been completely cut out. <br /> <br />Breakdown - OK. <br /> <br />Pretty Tied Up - Okay, but this is where the quality of the album starts to degenerate...five or six great songs in a row, then the filler.... <br /> <br />Locomotive (Complicity) - Sort of a catchy rhythm but not the epic they seemed to think it was going to be, clocking in at about 8 or 9 minutes. Way too long. <br /> <br />So Fine - The quality starts to peak again - So Fine is a very fine song (pun intended!) and has a catchy beat and good lyrics. <br /> <br />Estranged - The November Rain of the Illusion II album, even if it's just slightly inferior. It's a blast, though, with a great opening, great lyrics, great vocals, a great message at its core - overall, a great song from beginning to end, even if it becomes a bit repetitious (at least one chorus could have been cut and the song could be two minutes shorter, but hey, I'm not complaining). <br /> <br />You Could Be Mine - A return to the core of Appetite, this loud and wild song was included on the Terminator 2 soundtrack, and the music video (now out of print and not included on the music video collection due to licensing issues) featured a cameo by Arnold himself, intercut with scenes from the movie. Next time you watch T2, notice the clever reference to Gn'R - Arnie pulls out some roses, Robert Patrick pulls out a gun. John Connor has a poster for the band in his bedroom (deleted scene included on the DVD). Love it. <br /> <br />Don't Cry (Alternate Lyrics) - I actually prefer it to the original in some ways. This is considered some sort of disgrace, because it's a re-mix and re-mixes aren't \\"allowed\\" to be good. However, some people forget that both albums were released at the same time - therefore, you could name this \\"Don't Cry Original\\" because they've both been around as long as the other...at least commercially...(yes, I'm aware Axl wrote the original before even Appetite was released). <br /> <br />My World - An utter disaster, although fun to listen to in a sort of so-bad-it's-good-kinda-way. Like a car wreck, you can't take your eyes -- or, in this case, your eyes -- off of it. (Then again, this is more like a track wreck than a car wreck -- yep, that's how bad it is.) I guess Axl figured there was two minutes' worth of space left on the album so he'd throw in a piece of utter crap for good measure. And crap it is -- this is a fantastically bad song (barely clocking in at two minutes) in which Axl attempts to do some sort of punk rap rock thing. It's awful, awful stuff, but really funny, too. \\"Ugh. Ugh. Ugh. Guess what I'm doing now!\\" I don't know, Axl -- but I have a good idea...could ya be less subtle next time? <br /> <br />Overall: 10/10 <br /> <br />If November Rain had taken the place of My World, Pretty Tied Up, and Shotgun Blues, it could stand a case for being the best Gn'R album (honestly). It's still a 10/10 because of the great opening (five wonderful tracks in a row!) and closing (until My World, of course) but I can't help but wonder just how amazing it would have been had they taken some of the other songs they cut (which were being passed around on bootleg \\"Forgotten Illusions\\" CDs and cassettes in the past) and replaced the poor songs with the better ones, or altogether cut them. Sometimes, more isn't better. But in the case of \\"Forgotten Illusions\\", Gn'R really cut some good songs to make way for bad ones (e.g. Shotgun Blues). Why did they remove Jumpin' Jack Flash?! <br />
0553212737|2.0|I do like 19th Century fiction. I do like Pride and Predjudice. I know lots of people don't like saying Classics are uninteresting. Apparantly Jane Austen said after writing this book that she had wanted to create a character that no-one would like but herself. I am the only person I know who hates Emma. I agree that the book is well written but I just don't like Emma. Sorry if you do.
B000089CJI|4.0|The Postal Service's music is truly different, in that it uses certain sounds and beats not found in your typical 80's retro style, modern indie music. The lyrics definitly make a clear point after thinking about what the song is trying to stress, which for me was towards the end of every song. However, as a trance DJ, I think that the sounds and synths of PS's music should definitly be looked over again. They are awful. I found that they apply too much -6db and -8db on the songs, pretty much on every song. If they could just adjust these specific settings on their songs, it would definitly have a more suitable & pleasing taste for the indie-pop fad.    I hope their next album doesnt carry this problem along. It really causes a disgrace in the music.
B000059MEK|5.0|I bought Daft Punk's \\"Discovery\\" when I was an idiotic 7th grader who knew next to nothing about music. Keep in mind that this was in 2001, back when n&uuml;-metal bands like Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park were considered gods by everyone around me. I saw the video for their hit song \\"One More Time\\" on Toonami, and being the anime dweeb that I am, ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT. Soon afterwards, I went and bought the album, and found out that almost every track was BEYOND stellar.<br /><br />When you compare this to their first album, \\"Homework\\", it hardly seems like the same people are responsible for it. Homework was little more than a series of old-school rap beats with electronic melodies and the occasional vocoder thrown over them. Discovery is far more euro-pop influenced than it's predecessor, meaning there's alot more variety. There are also more tracks with vocals, and FAR less repetition, which really bogged down some parts of their previous album.<br /><br />Aside from One More Time, \\"Digital Love\\", \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" \\"Superheroes\\" and \\"Something About Us\\" in particular, are stunning: all of which either contain some amazing keyboard solos, excellent use of vocoders, or both. I think Daft Punk has a very Robert Smith-ish quality to them in terms of lyrics, in how they can both make cliche love lyrics sound fresh, important, and even vital! Also worth mentioning is \\"Face To Face\\", which sounds like a straight-out-of-1986 new wave song minus the fakeness.<br /><br />It's not perfect though: Two of the tracks (\\"High Life\\", \\"Too Long\\") are simply put...duds. Too Long wouldn't be so bad if it didn't live up to it's name. If you're gonna make a song last for 10 minutes, choose a stronger track. Simple as that.<br /><br />2 tracks, however, should NOT deter you from buying this record. The immense strength of the other 12 tracks more than makes up for it. Listen to it, and get sucked into it's gleaming, interstellar, futuristic world.<br /><br />It's nice to know that later in my life, I'll be able to put this glorious piece of nostalgia on and relive 2001 all over again. It'll do the same for you.e to know that later in my life, I'll be able to put this glorious piece of nostalgia on and relive 2001 all over again. It'll do the same for you.

B00005O3VC|4.0|This movie is totally hilarious.  Even more funny late at night when you are sleep deprived.  This movie is such a spoof of all things British you know it will tickle your funny bone.  From the limbless black knight (come back here, I'll bite your kneecaps off) to the obnoxious French soldiers, this movie is a classic and should be watched atleast once a year.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|I'm not going to write a long review. Instead, i'm gonna make a track-by-track analysis.<br /><br />1. Into the Lungs of Hell [Instrumental]- Great intro, to a great album. 5/5<br /><br />2. Set the World Afire- Great song, but not the best. 4/5<br /><br />3. Anarchy in the U.K.- A cover of the Sex Pistol's hit song. This is a VERY catchy song. 4/5<br /><br />4. Mary Jane- Good song. 5/5<br /><br />5. 502- \\"Pull over s***head, this is the cops!\\" Sorry just had to say that! 5/5<br /><br />6. In My Darkest Hour- My favorite song on the album. One of Megadeth's best songs. 10/5<br /><br />7. Liar- I love it when Dave shouts \\"YOU F*****G LIAR!!!\\". 5/5<br /><br />8. Hook in Mouth- Great way to end a great album. 5/5<br /><br />Overall:<br /><br />It certainly ain't Megadeth's best album, but still a good CD.
6305388458|5.0|Amazing that you can spoof a predominant religion and have it turn out so funny.  I am especially fond of the scene where rebellious jews are having a meeting discussing \\"What have the Romans ever done for us?\\" Oh, baths, roads, sewage system, coliseum, peace.... you get the point.  What makes the Life of Brian so funny is that it hits so close to home at both the religious and secular level.  This ranks as one of my favorite 20 movies. Only those with terminal disciplitis will not find this tremendously funny movie a treat to watch.

B000002UA5|4.0|This is the Pink Floyd's sprawling double lp of experimentation and searching. Ummagumma finds the band each dabbling in its own musical fancy, each member contributing a handful of tracks to the album and each member's sound is uniquely differently from the rest, kind of like an audio representation of their personality. That is the studio side, the other side is 4 live tracks from previous recordings and each song is masterfully executed, Syd Barrett's space opus \\"Astronomy Domine\\" is particullarly good and \\"Set the Controls for the Heart of the Sun\\" is one of the few cases in which the live recording is lightyears ahead of its studio birthed counterpart. Ummagumma is often overlooked in the Floyd catalogue with so many other excellent, cheap and easily available Floyd records why should fans invest their time and money into this? After all this double album set is costly and isnt going to be at your local Wal-Mart. I simply say this should be listened to because if you enjoy the other Floyd recordings or psychedelic music in general than this is simply one of the best recordings you can buy.
B0006399FS|1.0|The long-awaited reunion!! U2 are back!!... 5 stars people, did you listen to the whole album before buying it?. I don't think so. Surely 90% of you got the album at first, because you wanted to be the most loyal fans in the world, right?. You didn't even bother in listening to it before buying. You got 'Vertigo' with all that annoying iPod crap and that was enough for you. 'U2 are back to rock!!!', 'This album gonna rock !!!', 'I can't wait for the new tour', etc. Shame on you. You were fooled by that pitiful use of the brandname 'U2'.  <br /> <br />Don't you realise that song was used to fool people like you?. Everybody though this album was going to be a very raw one... The outcome? their most boring, flat, unoriginal and weak album ever. <br />Those 'rock' songs indeed are all very low quality attempts to match the All That You Can't Leave Behind record sales (11 million copies worldwide). <br /> <br />There was so much hype in 2004 about this album that finally fans felt dissapointed by this vanilla coporate product wrongly named as \\"U2\\". They promised too much for nothing. This pathetic effort is their most tragic ever. U2 2000 are opportunists bussinessmen who just use the former glory to sell the name of U2 with every new comeback.  <br /> <br />If early 80's Bono were here, do you think he would like to be this sellout faceless iPod man? <br /> <br />
B000063DFQ|3.0|I remember being disappointed when this came out. I started listening to Maiden when Killers came out. I definitely prefer the first two albums over all of the others. Every album after Killers is a little weaker than the one before it. Number of the Beast and Powerslave were the strongest of this period. Piece Of Mind is a \\"growth\\" album. It's not as fast and hard as the early stuff, but it's respectable for the fact that the band was evolving. The first half (or side, since I bought it on vinyl way back when it was released...) is excellent. There is enough of an edge and the longer \\"progressive\\" feel of the songs works overall. \\"The Trooper\\" is a quick kick in the face that starts the second half, and probably the best song on the cd. The rest of the side just lacks something. The songs don't seem very focused and I remember putting on \\"The Trooper\\" and taking it off. \\"Quest For Fire\\" is really awful.....embarrassing, actually - but still much better than most of the hair band crap that was starting to pop up everywhere at the time.  <br />Respectable, but hardly the best set from Maiden overall. <br />....Also, is it possible for people to express their opinions without making personal attacks? ...Some people will love this, others will hate it, but state your case and stop the childish name calling! It's about the music, not people's egos.
B00004Y6O7|5.0|In simple terms: this CD rocks like very few other CD's in its genre. There is a darkness and playfullness that intertwine seemlessly. Without question, this is the best Van Halen CD.<br /><br />There is not one mediocre song. They flow beautifully together. The vocals and guitar work are masterfully done. A music collection would be lacking without the inclusion of \\"Fair Warning.\\"<br /><br />In so many ways, this CD fully demonstrates the essence of Rock 'n' Roll. Van Halen was once the master of this art.
B00008973Q|5.0|This movie is spectacular!  I just bought the Masterworks Edition DVD recently, and it is better than my older Ran DVD.  I don't know what people are talking about-I thought the picture on this DVD was really good (Criterion Collection could probably do a better job, they are superior!) and the sound was brilliant.  There could have been a little more extras though... <br /> <br /> <br />  For the uninitiated, this is Kurosawa's take on Shakesphere's King Lear.  I had read King Lear before watching the movie, and yes, I dare say it...I like Kurosawa's version of King Lear better! (if that is a fair statement since Kurosawa's is a little different).  Anyway, this movie is really, really superb and magnificent in every category.  You name it-visuals (absolutely breathtaking), audio, acting, action sequences, costumes, etc.  Many scenes in this movie are really, really memorable (especially the scene where Hidetora and his men are attacked in a castle by Hidetora's sons Jiro and Taro- one of the best action sequences on film!).  Why this movie didn't win Best Picture of the Year or at least Best Foreign Film in 1985 is totally beyond me (it only won Best Costume Design!). <br /> <br />  So overall this movie is an amazing film.  It is truly a masterpiece of masterpieces!  In fact, I think this film is only rivaled by some of Kurosawa's other films (Seven Samurai and Rashomon).  Anyway, if you haven't seen this film yet, (the words of Napoleon Dynamite, \\"IDIOT!\\")  go buy/rent it now.  Any movie buff will love this movie, but Kurosawa fans, war movie fans, and period action movie fans in particular will love it.  This movie definately deserves 5 stars.
B0007GADZO|3.0|Gotta start this review saying that I've had only listened to this album no more than ten times, and, rest assured (needless to say to any fan of Steve), this low amount of experiences won't tell the real justice of an album of such a great, talented musician... <br />Just the opening track will let you know that Steve is as sharp as the guitarists come, as he is using all his guitar knowledge to show us how it has to be done... The man is excelent whithin any technical field the guitar can deliver... There's no doubt about that... The man's on a league of his own, leaving behind names like Gilbert, Satriani, Moore, Timmons... Don't get me wrong, I love all of these guys (I'm a guitarist in case you didn't notice...), but Steve has the urge to go far beyond done... At least, that's what I used to think, but now, with this album, I don't find anything new... It's like more of the same thing... There are no broken boundaries, no new musical challenges... It seems to me Steve is way to worried making money and touring without dedicating much effort to produce an album worthy of his sacred name... No doubt the man has the brain and the soul to go as far as he wishes, so, Steve, bring back something as revolutionary as The Ultra Zone, or Passion And Warfare, or Sex & Religion, or Alien Love Secrets... This is no album up to the expectations of five years, no just sequel to The Ultra Zone... <br />We count on you, to keep doing what you do best: exceed, be a musician that is on another level, different than the rest... Don't be another one, show the rest of the world how to do it (Using your own words). <br />To sum up: To the fans, they might find this albums pleasing (As sure will I, within a few days), but to those who wanna start listening Steve, I recommend Passion And Warfare, or Alien Love Secret, or the rip-off Anthology... <br />Long Live to the guitar, and to Dr. Vai, who is the number one...
B00030590I|1.0|Just as I have had to ransack contemporary country music in search of good rock & roll, unable to find it elsewhere, so I have had in recent days to search among Chinese films to find something that touches the heart, for the same reason.  Most American films I see are filled with magnificently special-effected visuals, significant of nothing. <br /> <br />\\"Crouching Tigers\\" was one such Chinese film I was touched by, odd this is to say about a martial arts movie.  But the two things needed to engage my feelings I found there:  compelling characters caught up in a compelling story.  When I heard tell that \\"Hero\\" was of that same ilk, only even better, I eagerly went.  My verdict:   <br /> <br />Utterly uncompelling characters caught up in a presentation so narratively disjointed as not even to qualify as a story.  Why was who doing what to whom?  Who's side were we supposed to be on?  Were impending or anticipatable events to be welcomed and cheered along or dreaded and resisted?  Don't ask this mess, just blink at all the pretty, meaningless images blurring by. <br /> <br />This thing is not a movie but a coffee-table book to be brusquely, unthinkingly riffled.  If someone wants to argue that it consists of not just pretty but of artful images, I will not contest the point; if they want to call it a film, I very much will. <br /> <br />
B000002J09|5.0|A.  All of 'em.  I like reading first listen memories of this classic.  Here's mine:    I bought this LP when I read a Hit Parader that had 'KISS vs. Led Zeppelin, who's the best' or something like that on the cover.  I was 8yrs old.  Being really into KISS, I put the record on expecting hard rock in the pop/glam style of KISS.  'hey hey mama see the way you move....'  I thought, hmm, this is not what I expected.      I couldn't stop pulling it from the record shelf and listening to this vinyl masterpiece.  It would CALL me on sunny days, rainy days, then everyday.  I had to have MORE.  By the time I was ten my friends thought I had lost it.  I had most all of Zep's records, or at least a recording of them.  They said Nugent=cool, Aerosmith=cool, KISS=cool, but Led Zeppelin sucks.  Funny how things change.  Between the time where my peers in school hated and then loved Zeppelin, the most common thing I would hear is that they made music for potheads.  I barely knew, if really at all what pot was at 8yrs. of age.  My addiction to Zeppelin music was incredible, though.  It must have been the variety of styles they used, -I dunno-.    Also, I have to mention that I love every studio recording this group made.  5 stars for each just doesn't seem enough.  30 years of listening to it, I STILL listen to all of these songs INCLUDING Stairway to Heaven, and this one keeps CALLING me....
B00018D44U|1.0|Talk about a one shot artist!  Her first album was tedious enough, but this!   It all blends into the same song and I can't for the life of me understand what all the hoopla is about.  She is a mediocre singer and an average piano player.  I'm sure she would be marvelous at some late night piano bar, but all this celebrity?  Puleeeze.
B000001ES9|3.0|This is a good debut, but usually I like a group's debut much better.  What is it about that?  The debut of Zeppelin?  Great.  The debut of Sabbath?  Great.  Aerosmith, Nugent (solo), Any hair band of the '80s, they all had great debut albums.  This one's OK.  Rush got better with age.  ~~~I could say this about Pink Floyd too, I guess.  This one's just not a starting point for listening to Rush.
1594200106|5.0|I had trouble putting THE SHADOW OF THE WIND down. Great descriptions of Barcelona (which is a wonderful city for the story), interesting post-Spanish-civil-war times, and lots of intrigue surrounding a rare and valuable novel. Though I sometimes predicted the perpetrator of certain mysterious actions, the book never ceased to delight and surprise me. I highly recommend the book to anyone searching for an engrossing and fun novel--a mystery with a lot of passion mixed in, as well as a glimpse of another time and place.
B000002KDO|5.0|If you look up Heavy Metal in the dictionary, it should say 'hear this recording'.  Make no mistake, this is not just hard rock, this is HEAVY METAL.  The first 5 albums get 5 stars, but this one is the 'stranded on desert island...' record.
B0000039PW|5.0|Ready to Die will always be remember in the hip hop community as the best gangsta rap album ever made, Every single song is so beautifully done and biggie's flows are so smooth it made me happy that I'm still listening to it. <br /> <br />Rap These Days makes me sick now, thanks to all of the garbage has been put on the airwaves, but this album will be remember for a long time and for any fan who thinks Guerilla Wack is better than Biggie should be ashamed of themselves. <br /> <br />This is the best album of all time. <br />
B000024D4R|5.0|Maybe.  Wish You Were Here and this one are my favoriteS.  I really don't know which one I play more.  Most fans already know this, but if you like these two, you might want to check out Gilmour's first solo effort.<br /><br />Roger Waters (in my opinion) was at his creative peak during this time.  I love The Wall and Final Cut, but I have to be in the mood for those.  For me, Prog Rock is all about 'atmosphere', and there's more atmosphere on this record than the whole mass of air surrounding the planet itself!!!
B000002JOH|4.0|This takes some ideas suggested in Metallica's Black Album and takes it to \\"A New Level.\\" Dimebag Darrel has made his guitar playing even more distorted, while Phil has stripped any hint of actual singing from his vocals. <br />The album starts off with \\"Mouth for War,\\" a driving song with an excellent riff. It also contains rhythm guitar during the solo, something that I wish Pantera would have done more often. \\"A New Level\\" is also good with Dimebag's best solo on the album. \\"Walk\\" is the most memorable song off of the album, it's a shame that it is so overplayed. \\"Hollow\\" is a semi-ballad to end the album. Phil begins with a normal singing voice that is beautiful, with so much emotion, it's a shame that he doesn't use it more often. It starts out quiet with some acoustic guitar, yet about halfway through it changes into thrash mode, with a excellent riff which shows up again at the end of the song for a memorable ending. <br />The rest of the songs in between are no where near as good as the ones that I mentioned. While some of the songs are decent, it seems in some others that Pantera values heaviness over songwriting, with Phil's voice just a yell. His voice is very effective when he uses it correctly (\\"Walk,\\" \\"Mouth for War\\"), but he goes instead for shock effect. My complaints aside, this is a very good album. Dimebag's work alone is worth the price of this disc.
B00005JKED|4.0|Ha hah hah! That was a GREAT sequence and a funny line. Also good was when the talk of an insane man in court putting his hand down the back of his pants, back out and up to his mouth with fingers covered in s__t. But it wasn't s__t, it was PEANUT BUTTER! He was declared INSANE and eventually released! Great performances throughout (including Snoop Dogg). King Kong ain't got nothin' on me!!
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This movie is superb! I've seen it 3 times in a span of just a week! I still can't believe it generated a lot of criticism about it being corny, cheesy, etc. I've never seen the play nor had an infinitesimal idea what the story was about before I watched the movie. I went in the movie theater without any preconceived notions. I came out sighing and loving the movie! I love everything about it! The part I loved most was when Christine and Raoul were singing \\"All I ask of you\\". They felt the song...I felt the song. I was so touched by it and the emotions on their faces I almost bawled my eyes out! Patrick Wilson and Emmy Rossum were fantastic! I like Minnie Driver as Carlotta. I suppose she was supposed to be a bit over-the-top because she IS the prima donna of \\"L'opera Populaire\\". The person I liked least was the Phantom. I didn't really feel his pain or loneliness. I think he's quite dashing and very handsome though. Gerard Butler's voice was nice but it kind of falls flat when you compare it to Emmy Rossum's. I really, really love this movie. I want to watch it again! I can't wait for the DVD. It has become one of my favorite movies of all time! <br />
B0002XDODU|1.0|this album sucks, no one should buy it, save the money and buy a decent metal album , theses guys get worse with every album if you like a singer with a low range voice try giving type o negative a chance..
0316172324|4.0|When you read this book, you will most certainly notice that Gladwell is not a linear thinker.  It will come out in the way that he manages to link up a multitude of seemingly unrelated phenomena and events in pure genius fashion, but also in the way the book appears slightly disorganized.  In anecdote after anecdote, Gladwell shows us how our first impressions are better than spending a lot of time with something trying to figure it out IF (and this is a big \\"if\\" that some of the people reviewing seem to have missed) we have some good, reliable experience with what it is we're forming a first impression of.  The rule of thumb appears to be this:  first impressions are better than too much thinking, but first impressions can also be wrong and fool us if we don't know much about what we're trying to form an opinion of or, more importantly, if we let our biases get in the way.  And as he tells us, the more experience we have with something, the less our biases affect us during our first impressions.   <br /> <br />What this book does is bridge the gap between a lot of disciplines (without actually using the terminology of many of them) to make it readable and useable for the general public.  The main problem with it, as I previously alluded to, is that sometimes it's difficult to remember where he's been or to tell where he's going next.  At times he attempts to remind you, but there's never any overarching summary.  The cardinal rule of speeches or books like this is:  \\"Tell people what you're going to tell them, tell them, then tell them what you told them.\\"  Gladwell only does the second one.  If you can keep in mind his main thesis, this book will absolutely change the way you see the world and yourself.
0440237688|4.0|For a young adult title, this book was quite intriguing. It is a dystopian novel in which a child is chosen to be the person that will carry on all the knowledge that society keeps from the general public. He starts questioning society and has to decide what he should do. Very quick read.

Es una historia de amor, de odio y de los sue&ntilde;os que viven en la sombra del viento.<br /><br />En este di&aacute;logo resume Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n la trama de su novela La sombra del viento, libro que naci&oacute; con buena estrella, finalista del premio Fernando Lara del a&ntilde;o 2000 (que en esa edici&oacute;n gan&oacute; Un largo silencio de &Aacute;ngeles Caso), uno de los miembros del jurado sorprendido por la calidad de la novela, a pesar de no resultar ganadora, la recomienda para su edici&oacute;n, se transforma en un &eacute;xito de ventas en Espa&ntilde;a y durante el a&ntilde;o pasado ocup&oacute; durante largo tiempo los primeros lugares en las listas de mejores vendidos en varios pa&iacute;ses de Latinoam&eacute;rica.<br /><br />&Eacute;xito que se debe a la recomendaci&oacute;n de boca en boca de sus lectores, m&aacute;s que a la maquinaria publicitaria de las editoriales o el renombre del autor, quien naci&oacute; en Barcelona en 1964 y anteriormente hab&iacute;a publicado cuatro libros: El pr&iacute;ncipe de la niebla (Premio de Literatura Infantil Edeb&eacute; 1993), El palacio de la medianoche, Las luces de septiembre y Marina, todas ellas encasilladas como \\"literatura juvenil\\", mientras que La sombra del viento es su \\"primera novela para adultos\\", de la cual ha vendido m&aacute;s de un mill&oacute;n y medio de ejemplares en todo el mundo y se ha traducido a treinta idiomas.<br /><br />La historia comienza en 1945, en Barcelona, el d&iacute;a que el padre de Daniel Sampere le revela la existencia del Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados, donde le es revelado que los libros tienen alma, \\"El alma de quien lo escribi&oacute;, y el alma de quienes lo leyeron o vivieron y so&ntilde;aron con &eacute;l. Cada vez que un libro cambia de manos, cada vez que alguien desliza la mirada por sus p&aacute;ginas, su esp&iacute;ritu crece y se hace fuerte\\"; adem&aacute;s, el ni&ntilde;o Sampere es invitado a seleccionar uno entre todos los libros, para adoptarlo, para asegurarse de que nunca desaparezca y siempre se mantenga vivo.

B0002858YS|5.0|I refuse to believe the press releases that these guys are from Vegas. They are simply too good! American acts seem to have been picked by the suits and marketing punks. Songs made for commercials for beer or cars....boring and pre-packaged. It seems that rock/pop is on a well deserved comeback, thank goodness. This debut album is wonderful. The band has a unique sytle of their own that is hard to peg. Lots of energy, a good tight band with an impressive singer. Just good tunes...give this release a chance - you won't regret it.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|While looking through all 928 reviews I was checking out all of the 1 and 2 stars and some of the 3 stars(which were hard to find due to the gigantic number of 5 stars :D) to see what people didnt like about this great CD. Plenty of things to complain about here. First off, If you haven't even heard the CD and you give it a 1, you're a dumbass. Secondly, I dont see why everyone says that just cuz this CD isnt as good as Mer De Noms, it deserves a 3. Mer De Noms deserves like 2000 stars. This CD is definently wickid. Next, if you said this was too slow/boring, the basic rythms and tempos are almost Identical to Mer De Noms, they just took out a little of the guitar work and made the guitar have a bit more of an effect, rather than a controlling force. Sounds good to me. Next, someone said there arent any guitar rifs or sumthing like that and it was boring. If your looking for guitar rifs go look.....anywheres. Thats one of the things I like about APC, they have like an overall sound on each song as a full band, not as like individual parts. Next, A lot of people compared APC to Tool. Wtf.. I barely see any similarities or reason to compare the two. Both are incredible and both have completely dif sounds. Next, some genious on here actually compared This cd to some cd by korn, KORN, are you joking me !? lol, how do you even compare a single song by either band to one another, besides the fact that Korn tried to rip off the great new sound of Tool and become another Fusion band(too bad they suck though). And then there was the guy who said the renesance thing...well... I have nothing to say to that besides if your looking for some mainstream 80s rock or sumthing, go buy sum yngwie malmsteen or metallica.... This CD kicks ass.... buy it !
B0007TKNL0|4.0|I saw the play about a year before this movie came out, I saw the play and was blown away. I didn't really think the movie would be all that great. It wasn't nearly as amazing as the play, but it did stick to the play quite well and I assume that's why I liked it more. The two things that really bothered me, though, were the electric guitars at the end of 'The Phantom of the Opera' song, and the masquerade costumes, which weren't colorful and wild like the ones in the play. Overall, I'd say the movie is worth buying, but nothing beats the real thing.
B00005OAIE|1.0|Despite what some here say, this guy is an insufferable whiner. One song after the other is filled with meek, timid and just plain 'ol irritating whining and wimpering. Put simply, here is the cure for insomnia. He makes some of the other current whiners like \\"Five for Fighting\\" or \\"3 Doors Down\\" actually look not too bad. <br />We need to take up a collection for poor John. Sappy, wimpy and testosterone-deficient is no way to go through life. <br />
B0002F7I9Y|5.0|For nearly 60 years, Ray Charles was, and still is, even after his death, an icon in popular music.  He has experimented with, influenced, and been influenced by most every genre of music from rock & roll to country and from Jazz to reggae. <br /> <br />\\"Genius Loves Company\\" shows Charles in a series of duets with many of music's fine contemporary artists like Willie Nelson, Van Morrison, James Taylor, blus master B.B. King, and the rising Norah Jones. <br /> <br />Charles revisits several of his old classics and many of his fellow artists' hits such as \\"Sweet Potato Pie,\\" \\"Crazy Love,\\" \\"Heaven Help Us All,\\" \\"Hey Girl,\\" and \\"Sinner's Prayer\\".  Each song is a classic varying in style and creativity.  \\"Genious Loves Company\\" is Ray Charles' finest work, his final gift to his adoring fans.  This is an essential for any Ray Charles fan, young and old.  The album is a milestone in R&B and all-around music history.  Any listener won't be disappointed.  I guarentee it.
B000002OVJ|5.0|This was my favorite live rock album hands down before I heard How the West Was Won, and I'm still not sure which I like more but they are both superb.  The opening track 'Heaven and Hell' is dominated by John Entwistle who breaks into some really funky baselines and I like what Roger Daltrey does on backup vocals.  I think it's the most underrated song on the album and I had to listen to it a couple of times before I really dug it but now it's one of my very favorite who songs period.  I really like the vocals on Tatoo and I'm really glad that they added these great songs (I mean how in gods name was heaven and hell ommitted from the first album release?).  \\"Young Mans Blues\\" is worth the 10 bucks by itself so please go buy this album.  With the exceptions of the superb version of 'A Quick One' and the weaker 'Fortune Teller' cover, the radio \\"hits\\" on this album are the weakest tracks.  Songs like 'Can't Explain','I'm A Boy', 'Substitute', 'Happy Jack', 'magic bus', and the actual 'My Generation' portion of the 15 minute medley all sound better to me in their studio version.  'Amazing Journey' is an awesome song that gets even better when they let loose on 'Sparks'.  'Summertime Blues' is another stellar song worth the price of the album alone.  I have absolutely no need to fast forward my ipod or cd player listening to this album and should you be so wise to buy it you won't either it's that good.  That seems to be a pretty good although subjective benchmark for the greatest of the great albums and this one qualifies.  Church.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zeppelin is, without a doubt, one of the greatest rock bands of all time, and this album proves it.  1969's \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" contains many of the band's finest hits like \\"Whole Lotta Love,\\" \\"The Lemon Song,\\" \\"Heartbreaker,\\" and my personal favorite, the mystical \\"Ramble On\\".  <br /> <br />Each song is a classic and breaks the boundaries of hard rock.  It also shows the band's great diversity in dabbling with the likes of folk music and the ecstatic, eccentric solos, particularly those of drummer, John Bonham on songs like \\"Moby Dick\\".  The qualities shown here were the ones that took Led Zeppelin to their height and made them godlike in rock & roll, and \\"Led Zeppelin II\\" is the perfect album to prove it.
B000002TQV|5.0|The fabulous second album from Radiohead is their best in my mind. The unique sense and style of rock n' roll that they so blatantly express through their music is so undeniably brilliant. Whether you like them or not, no one can deny the sheer talent of this band. The Bends, not quite as obscure as their later sounds, carries a certain feel that few rock listeners will ever hear again. From the  guitar strumming of High and Dry to the melodic Bullet Proof...I wish I was, this album has it all. I would be say that this is their best effort by far. Many Radiohead fans would disagreee, saying that OK Computer is their best, however I find this effort to be more consistent throughout. I will not deny their spectacular achievement with OK Computer, but I prefer this album to it.<br /><br />Best Songs(they're actually all good):<br /><br />Fake Plastic Trees: A touching, melodic, very meaningful ballad with a magnificent guitar tune.<br /><br />Just: A fabulous single.<br /><br />Street Spirit: A magnificent closing to song with fantastic guitar strumming and obscure, yet effective lyrics.<br /><br />High and Dry: A classic Radiohead track. Nothing more to be said.<br /><br />Black Star: A glorious piece of work with a superb lyrical effort.<br /><br />Overall, this album is remarkable. Radiohead has an extraordinary sense of rock n' roll and it's quite possibly best displayed in this album. Highly recommended to any Radiohead fan, you'll love every single song off this album.
0312263120|3.0|I do agree there is an explicit effort made not to keep the book down before you finish. Jana is prejudised about personal life of hard core technical people. Nothing stops Strathmore to possess Susan since he has not made up of metal. I think Dan Brown has leveraged those personal feelings. But I do agree that around 40 to 50 pages have been written to increase the weight of the book. I would go by the opinion you can read it once.
B00005JNEW|4.0|I feel very conflited on the movie. It was a very entertaining movie, and definitely worth the price of admission alone. But on the other hand (having already read the book), i feel that the movie did not stay true to the book. <br /> <br />The book is a great book, but the book is a criticism of the state of a city in western texas. The movie did not include all the financial information, like how the football charters planes for their away games, and the amount of money spent on the state of the art football field. While the movie was more glorifying high school football. <br /> <br />Also, having just finished my senior year of high school football, I found myself weeping at the end. Not crying, weeping. For anybody who has played, and enjoyed the game you'll most likely have many cords struck. Partically the half-time speech of the last game, my coach gave almost the same exact speech before our last game together. <br /> <br />The movie captures high school football, pretty realistically, but it didn't get 5 stars due to not staying true to the book. <br />
0071373586|5.0|at this point in time. some shifts in terms of brand disenchantment have been noted, but this is, in my opinion, still the way the marketing (customer's mind) works and how markete should go about putting their products in the market.
B00005JL3A|3.0|I have to confess that I don't play video games - eye-hand coordination and lightning reflexes weren't included in my genetic package, so this review is based on the movie - and nothing but the movie.<br /><br />Other than Milla Jovovich, no cast member did any real acting.  Michelle Rodriguez had a fairly difficult role to play, but the snarling and eye rolling was just too much at times.  She was necessarily tough, but the dialogue also really let her down. The rest of the cast was on par for a B Grade horror movie, and only slightly more animated than the zombies.<br /><br />This movie is what happens when you mix too many good things in a haphazard way. Imagine trying to write a coherent script when your \\"must\\" list includes zombies, were-dogs, sloppy genetic mutations with long tongues, a controlling computer system, an impregnable \\"fortress\\", a knockout babe with amnesia, a SWAT team, biological warfare, viruses, spies and saboteurs, a battle on a train, and guns - lots of guns.<br /><br />The zombie scenes failed to impress, no gore to be seen anywhere - they just looked like a typical crowd of people in the mosh pit at a rock concert.  The mutating tissue-thing was straight out of a Dean Koontz book, and most of the suspense scenes weren't very suspenseful, because whatever you expected to happen - did.<br /><br />On the cool side, you had the wicked lasers to do the slicing and dicing, Alice's (Milla) hot red zombie-kicking slit-way-up the side dress, and the fight scenes.  Many parts may seem familiar, mainly because you've seen scenes just like them in other popular action movies.<br /><br />Next time let Alice do some Mortal Kombat with Lara Croft and you can call it a Final Fantasy.<br /><br />Amanda Richards, February 22, 2005
B00005JN4O|5.0|Mr. Barrie's (Johnny Depp) play, Peter Pan, was so ground-breaking, so unusual, that even his producer (Dustin Hoffman) thought him a bit cuckoo when he presented his ideas to him. And with the miserable failure of his last play, it's little surprise.<br /><br />But this new one has something unusual, something not quite tangible in the mind. Why? Because Mr. Barrie's inspiration was a group of young boys who've lost their father and are preparing for the worst kind of news about their mother, too (played excellently by Kate Winslet).<br /><br />What struck me as interesting and incredible about the film is that it focuses on the muse of a writer; and this muse is pretty dark. Peter (Freddie Highmore), is a lonely boy even within his family of brothers. He misses his father terribly, and he doesn't know how to grieve. So when Johnny Depp appears in his life, he's none too happy about it (\\"You can't replace my father\\"). Can this young boy find salvation in the writings of one man? Can he find that bit of serendipity that we all lose as children when we hit the barrier of adulthood? Even with his mother in mortal danger?<br /><br />Sound kinda dark? It is. But the amazing thing about it is that the film is tremendously uplifting, even with death looming in the shadows.<br /><br />I will say that Johnny Depp never ceases to amaze me. I loved him in Pirates of the Caribbean, and it was often times difficult for me to imagine that this was the same actor playing this role. Kate Winslet was excellent as the ailing mother. Julie Christie was wonderful as the protective grandmother of Winslet's children. But to me, the show stealer was undoubtedly Freddie Highmore (Peter). I don't know where this boy came from, but his presence on screen brought a lump to my throat from the moment I saw him, and by the end of the film everyone in the theater (I mean everyone!) was blubbering like a baby. A shame that he didn't get nominated for Best Supporting Actor at the Oscars.<br /><br />I'll be owning this one on DVD when it comes out.s.  <br /> <br />I'll be owning this one on DVD when it comes out.
019280264X|5.0|After having read (and loved) Jane Austen's more famous novels EMMA and PRIDE AND PREJUDICE, I found MANSFIELD PARK a true delight. Fanny Price is taken in by her wealthy aunt and uncle as charity to her more lowly-married mother, and is raised with her cousins with the idea she needs refinement and education to become as good a woman as her lesser social standing will allow. Fanny is nervous and self-effacing, struggling with her new situation until her cousin Edmund makes her feel more at home. Gradually, she feels like a part of the family, although the nagging sense of unworthiness always asserts itself. As cousins marry and suitors appear, as scandals arise and emotions become known, Fanny finds herself in the equivalent of a Victorian soap opera.<br /><br />Fanny is undoubtedly one of Austen's less assertive characters, although she does mature into a woman who knows what she wants and will accept no less. I loved Fanny and her honesty, the little girl who fears the stars in her eyes and still manages to grow up into a respectable - and respected - woman. Her complexities are subtle and understated, making the reader work at times to understand her motivation, although anyone who has felt like an outcast even once, or anyone who respects honesty, will identify with her. In true Austen fashion, the observations are witty, with pointed social analysis and cynicism dressed up in sly humor. Fanny's aunts in particular are skewered, but no one, not even Fanny, is spared.<br /><br />Readers picking up this novel for the sheer delight of it will find it difficult to put down, as its language is accessible and free-flowing. Students and book club members who must pay closer attention to themes and other literary issues may want to consider the role social standing and money play; the evolution of Fanny's character (and whether she is sympathetic); the techniques Austen uses to evoke humor; and the courtship protocol for Victorian England and how the characters both work within, and violate, the social rules.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for teenagers and adults alike, especially those whose literary tastes run toward the classics.rk within, and violate, the social rules.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for teenagers and adults alike, especially those whose literary tastes run toward the classics.
B00005JKCH|4.0|Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire) is the quintessential boy next door.  He is kind of geeky, more than a little shy, and really nice.  Of course he is also very good at science.  Peter goes on a field trip to a laboratory doing interesting genetic experiments on spiders, and one happens to have escaped during Peter's field trip.  Naturally the ferocious little critter bites Peter.  Soon Peter discovers that he is really strong, and can shoot webs out his wrists, and can climb walls with his bare hands.  Why, Peter has become a superhero!  As those of us familiar with the superhero genre know, there is a lot of angst in the superhero world.  In Peter's case, it is the guy that he could have stopped with his new powers that kills his Uncle Ben (played by veteran Cliff Robertson), a guilt that plagues Peter through decades of Spider-Man comics and now in this movie.<br /><br />Peter also has yearnings for the beautiful redheaded girl next door, Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst).  Given Peter's natural shyness and his feelings of inadequacy, he has a hard time telling Mary Jane that he is attracted to her a lot.  Mary Jane adds to Peter's angst.<br /><br />Peter's Aunt May (Rosemary Harris) gets to heap on the angst yet further since she has lost her husband of many years when Peter could have prevented it, though Aunt May has yet to learn this information.  Poor Peter.  If angst were money Peter would be rich.  However, Peter also gets a cool enemy, the Green Goblin, aka Norman Osborn (Willem Dafoe).  The Green Goblin has a cool sort of Jet Ski for the air that emits a smoky trail, so that environmentalists will hate him since clearly it is the good spider versus the evil industrialist.<br /><br />As corny as the plot sounds, this movie is highly entertaining and enjoyable.  The computer generated images are well done, with some of the scenes approaching phenomenal.  While the quality of the plot and the ambiance fall short of \\"Superman the Movie\\" and \\"Batman,\\" this movie still joins the select group of superhero movies that are sufficiently believable and sufficiently true to the original comics to allow followers of Spider-Man comics to enjoy this movie.  Spider-Man is not an invincible superhero, and there are points where you wonder how he can possibly beat the Green Goblin.  I kept hoping that he would tell Mary Jane how he felt about her, but that has to wait another day.<br /><br />Technology has advanced to the point where movies such as \\"Spider-Man\\" are more than technologically advanced B-movies.  Tobey Maguire can act, as evidenced by his phenomenal role in \\"Seabiscuit,\\" and he does well in this movie.  While there were a few places where I was a little frustrated, I think it was because Peter Parker was less predictable in this movie than I would have expected from the comics, and that is a very good thing.<br /><br />There are several editions of \\"Spider-Man\\" available.  I prefer wide screen, but the second disc of the special edition is, like most special editions, uneven in its extras.  Some are reasonably good, others are filler.  If you have purchased other special edition DVDs, you will probably like this one.  Otherwise, get a lower cost wide screen variation and pass the special edition by.  However, whatever you do, you should get this one if you like superhero movies, because as a superhero movie this one is a winner.vie still joins the select group of superhero movies that are sufficiently believable and sufficiently true to the original comics to allow followers of Spider-Man comics to enjoy this movie.

B0002VEX7S|5.0|Judging by the date of release of Book of Secrets with a bonus DVD, I'd say that most of these reviews are for the CD sans DVD. <br />And I concur with the majority in singing the original CD's praises. <br />I was introduced to the music of Loreena McKennitt earlier this year when a friend loaned me the CD and I was immediately attracted to the music, so I went out and bought the remastered version with the DVD, which is what I will concentrate on in this review. <br />I like the entire CD, but my favorites are Skellig, the Middle-Eastern inflected Marco Polo, the aptly named La Serenissima, and Night Ride Across the Caucasus.  <br />The real reason to get this instead of the original is the bonus DVD. No Journey's End, in which McKennitt discusses the influences behind her music, is a gorgeous travelogue-like voyage through lands which contribute heavily to her sound. Who needs Riverdance when you can see some real Irish step-dancing and some real Irish musicians playing tunes on instruments developed in days lost in the mists of time? <br />In addition to the aforementioned, the DVD also presents a couple of music videos amongst which is the fantastic Mummer's Dance and an interactive discography in which the viewer can discover some of McKennitt's other work. <br />McKennitt's delivery is dreamy and haunting. And despite a friend's comment that her reverb is \\"stuck on eleven\\", I find her music to be most enjoyable and plan to get the remainder of her CDs that have been remastered with a bonus disc added. <br />If you have been a fan for a while, you already know what to expect. If you are a new listener, then I highly recommend Book of Secrets with a bonus DVD whether or not you think Celtic music is your thing.
0316172324|5.0|This is a book about using your intuition to understand situations and how to read people.  As with books about intuition, it takes using your intuition or imagination and having facts that makes this book make sense.<br /><br />Simply put, each story shows us how intuition is used in trying situations or in critical situations where a judgement must be made. How the experts just seem to 'do what they do' without explaining it, or how sometimes we interpret what we see, ignore what is obvious and look back and wonder why we did not pick up on the clues.<br /><br />If you wonder 'how do they do that?' when you observe an expert, Blink can answer that question some of the time.  An expert can make a decision using a flash of insight, or as with war, use their overall resources to make a decision in the heat of battle.<br /><br />In the introduction he says he wants us to find the value of 'a blink of an eye' and see that it sometimes is as valuable as deep rational analysis. Then, we see the anecdotes for what they are, rational analysis in the blink of an eye at times.<br /><br />There seems to be subjects here for everyone, an eclectic look into decision making, not scientific completely, maybe even a stretch, but the book is such a quick read as to really keep your interest.  I liked his analysis of sports figures, Ted William for one.  Williams said he watched the ball hit the bat when would hit. The book reveals that in reality, that is just not humanly possible. It was something else, Williams,  an expert, doing what he did best, could not fully explain how he did it.<br /><br />Interesting too is Gladwell's review of the science of reading faces.  I was fascinated that the human face has so many expressions that, according to research, may reveal what someone is thinking.  My only concern with that, may be that a flash of expression, may be an initial thought, followed by reality.  However, if someone is continually flashing an expression, it may reveal some deep seated feelings.  One case he uses is in a court room where someone flashes an expression of discust. It is brief and we are not sure where that evaluation is leading, so, was the person discusted at the question or the facts behind it?  How can we know?<br /><br />Blink will open up some very interesting perspectives for you who read it.  I think it was worth my time and money spent.  I believe that we cannot judge (condemn)others from expressions, but awareness of the world around us is really something we all need.reveal some deep seated feelings.

B00005JN0T|3.0|I'm not sure why they retagged \\"Hardwired\\" as \\"I, Robot.\\"  Will Smith has enough star power, and is a bona-fied sci-fi actor that they had no reason to drag Asimov into the production.  Furthermore, this name game hurt not only the film franchise, but also the novel's good names.  How can they do a film version of \\"Caves Of Steel\\" or even the \\"Foundation\\" novels if we have this out-of-place script.<br /><br />It is a tribute to Asimov, but then again, all sci-fi is a tribute to the masters: Wells, Verne, Doc Smith, and Asimov.  It would have been much better for continuity's sake to keep \\"Hardwired\\" as its own, separate franchise and name. Think of the spin-off, sequels, and TV series that they could have had, without offending all of the die-hard Asimov fans.<br /><br />As to the film, it is great, except for the first fifteen minutes of product placement.  I guess they put it at the beginning because the people who fall for that tend to have short attention spans. Anyone up for boycotting these products?<br /><br />This movie is a tribute to Asimov, so it feels like an Asimov story, but is more of a reaction piece and a distillation to all of Asimov's robot stories.  I almost want to say that after seeing this movie, you have read all of his robot books.<br /><br />I was also reminded of Tom Selleck's 1984 film \\"Runaway,\\" where he plays a sanitized and popularized Bladerunner.  Intellectually, \\"I, Robot\\" is head and shoulders above both of those films.  It makes you think about rules and how we would possible control these robots, and how we could misuse them.<br /><br />\\"Bladerunner,\\" by comparison, is too self-conscious of its cerebrally, and is too mystical.  It feels like a prologue to the Matrix-as if we haven't seen enough of that film already.<br /><br />I think this film serves as flint to spark one's interest in the novels-they are always better.
0670033375|5.0|Collapse caught my attention when I read the back cover and it was reviewed by Robert Waterman of \\"In Search of Excellence\\" fame.  After paging through it, I realized, this author is the real deal.  He is approaching the whole subject of the collapse of societies and environments in general from a 'centrist' or middle of the road view. What gets me is that Jarred Diamond's writing style is factual, passionate and interesting.<br /><br />Diamond's ability to compare facts with facts and his passion to communicate a need in a balanced way will get anyone's attention.  What he writes is a warning to us all, especially in the West where we seem to have it all and live in a comfort zone that belies the realities of our environment.<br /><br />When he writes about Montana, I was stunned at what I learned about how a relatively pristine environment with so much potential is in the process of continual spoiling.<br /><br />I was really impressed with his review of the history of Easter Island.  What seems like a fantasy island is really such a disaster when you go deeply into the history, development and demise of an isolated island.  As he uses Easter Island as a metaphor for a globalized world, he warns us that without knowing it, we could be in for a greater disaster than we realize with no outside help or any new place for humans to run to any longer.  As with the past, there was somewhere to go. Today, there is no new world or open space for us to resort to.  We have to protect what we have.<br /><br />I do like the middle of the road perspective.  His book is not a diatribe, nor does it excuse the misuse and destruction of the environment by big business.  The concept is, we have to live, so then, how do we in order to sustain life?<br /><br />Overall this book takes the concept of sustainable development and makes it real world and so much less a reactionary or radically based subject.  No, quite the contrary, it is rational.
038572179X|4.0|_Atonement_ is fascinating curio, not wholly successful but noble in the attempt: a compelling, self-reflexive tale about compelling, self-reflexive storytelling. Its centrepiece is Briony, a shy, withdrawn child who lives in a world of her imagination, and who continues - even after she has left her childhood behind - to make the world around her conform to that imaginary construct. The novel deals with the devastating consequences of her self-delusion, and eventual quest to make amends for her \\"crime\\" - to achieve atonement.  <br /> <br />The story is masterfully told, from the slow, tense build to the \\"crime\\" itself (one fateful night in 1935, Briony self-righteously interposes herself between her elder sister and her newly-discovered love for the son of the family's charlady) to the exploration of its fallout in the subsequent lives of the characters. Occasional false notes (the dubious misture of sophistication and childishness in younger Briony's thoughts, for example) are made neatly explicable by a final reveal, to which I shall return.  <br /> <br />There are two points on which the novel snags. The first, to judge by many of the reviews here, lies in what some have seen as a twist: the blurring of identity during the pivotal incident in 1935, and the subsequent (far too late) revelation of who was truly at fault that night. This, at least, seems to me to be a criticism that arises from a misunderstanding of authorial technique. The point is not the sleight-of-hand, but the fact that the characters wilfully deceive themselves into falling for it; to the reader, unhampered by the social and ethical assumptions of the upper-middle class interwar, the truth is surely obvious before the incident even occurs, simply by virtue of the things Briony observes without considering significant. The function of the 'twist' is to be a twist for the characters, not the reader; for the reader, it gives the measure of these people, who are so set in their prejudices that they do not even question the various conclusions they jump to.  <br /> <br />The second problem, and to this reader much more serious, lies within the 1999-set coda, and the very title of the novel. Without wanting to give too much away, it is here, not earlier, that authorial sleight-of-hand puts the whole thing in doubt. Briony, now in her 70s, has just finished another (final?) draft of the fiction she has constructed out of the events of 1935, and after; the final reveal of the truth, it is to be her atonement (likely posthumous). Yet even as she acknowledges the impossibility of the author seeking atonement within a story of her own making, she seems blithely unconcerned by the fact that what she has produced is neither atonement, nor the truth. She strives to bolster the veracity of her literary world (even corresponding with a WWII veteran over soldierly turns of phrase in 1940), but alters the emotional truth at its heart. As ever, she obsesses over the details, and misses the larger truth.  <br /> <br />Even at the end of her life, Briony is still driven to make life into fiction, to provide a \\"neater end\\" - and in doing so, perhaps, misses her atonement. Whether this hollow ending marks success or failure of the novel is hard to judge without knowing what McEwan intended, and perhaps wishing for anything else is simply to fall into Briony's trap of fictionalising life; but, rightly or wrongly, it may be dissatisfying to the reader.
B000007638|5.0|Peter Frampton had a better selling album, but not many bands (from the seventies) were captured LIVE better than Paul McCartney. Remember, Paul was a BEATLE - so he was a heckuva a great musician. Unfortunately, most of his hits (with some glowing exceptions) weren't as good on record as they were played here by a group gelling because of good players: Paul always played Bass bettah than evah. Denny Laine must've brought something to the table? Jimmy \\"Guitar Prodigy\\" McCullogh rocked as early as 1974 on Junior's Farm and Joe English had the \\"chops\\" to sing and play drums as good as anyone I've ever seen. (Where is he now? Unfortunately, Jimmy exited for Steve \\"Humble Pie\\" Marriot?!? and quickly parted with his Medicine Jar to the land of real Thunderclaps!) BUT: The Lovely Linda wasn't as bad as people wanted her to be. Did your wife give up being the ROCK Photographer to join your band? If she did, how good would she be? Paul's hit version of Maybe I'm Amazed came from here (#10) and Linda gets her props from a man who clearly loved his lady. What fun it is to listen to this recording today. It sound less dated than the studio LPs, and other than a few sessions John did with Elton, we almost have to think of this as the best Post Beatles cover band to play any Beatles tunes live and this is the best overall example of what could have been. Despite the underrated new lineup formed for a Rockestra on Back To The Egg (which was not bad) this band was Wing's best. Coming Up and McCartney II was scary. Paul was best in bands. Too bad, This Band wasn't smart enough to stay. They might be rocking today. (On the subject of that other band with Wings (insect ones!) Ringo's the oldest! Long live the last half until Alien 4 type cloning can bring back George and John - if they want to come back!)
B000001DTM|5.0|Never have I seen such a dramatically successful reinvention of a rock band.  I always liked U2 early on, but once The Joshua Tree hit, I started to back off.  Joshua was an absolute classic album, but it began the era of U2 taking themselves way too seriously, and it led to the God-awful Rattle and Hum.  Furthermore, the late 80's saw U2's fan-base morph into a johnny-come-lately-frat-boy arena rock following.  That all changed with Achtung Baby....They took bold risks, completely re-tooled their sound and attitude, and plunged themselves back into the category of credible alt-rock supergroup.  That's where they belong, in my opinion. <br /> <br />This album contains one incredible track after the other, and I found myself absolutely amazed at the soundscape they created.  Then, to top it all off, they followed it with one of the greatest tours ever staged.  To me, this album will always be the pinnacle of their career.
B0002KVUKM|2.0|I saw this in a theatre. What I thought as I left was 'great, no need to buy ~this~ movie on DVD'.<br /><br />As a mindless special effects romp, I think the movie is tolerable. Great special effects are the ones you don't realize are special effects. The effects in this film do not fit that definition of great, the computer enhancement is obvious. The movie can be fun, but I don't think it should get any award for technical excellence.<br /><br />The James Bond tie in, is that like a Bond film, the only relationship to the novel is maybe the title, and the name of the lead charactor(s). There is a Van Helsing in this movie, and there is a Dracula. That's where the similarity to anything that might have come from the pen of Bram Stoker ends. The movie is a series of high technology effects scenes very loosely tied together by an attempt at a plot.<br /><br />If you like action movies where thought is not required (or encouraged), this is your film. If you're looking for an interesting new take on a classic story, run away! run away!
B0006SSOHC|3.0|I had anticipated the release of this movie when I heard the buzz it garnered at Sundance in 04.  When it was released and I saw it in the theater, I was really glad it lived up to the buzz. <br /> <br />The story is about a very unusual serial killer who places his victims in situations where they might die, unless they figure out the way to save themselves.  The killer never actually commits the acts that cause the deaths of these people, an interesting premise in an of itself.  His latest victims are two men chained at opposite ends of a large washroom...with a dead body in between them.  One must shoot the other in order to save his family within an 8 hour period.  Their chains prevent alot of movement, but they have each been given a saw...not strong enough to cut through chains, but can penetrate bone.  Do you remove a limb and kill another stranger?  <br /> <br />The story, as I said, is a great premise, and for novice filmmakers, it plays much better than most first-time efforts.  But, the acting has weak points, and there are several holes in the plot that might bother some more picky viewers. <br /> <br />But, overall, the strengths of the story far outweigh the weaknesses, and it's a really nice addition to the thriller genre.   <br /> <br />The DVD has enough extras that it makes it a worthy addition to your collection.
0425188809|3.0|I barely know how to describe this novel.  It contains a Scrabble playing dog, an infanticidal psychopath, and even a deadly mutant baboon.  The book changes repeatedly from cute and playful to violent and gruesome, and at one point there's even a graphic sex scene straight out of a cheesy romance novel. <br /> <br />Unfortunately all of these quirky elements are held together by Koontz's flat, styleless tone.  Although many of the characters are borderline crazy and a few completely insane, they are all utterly predictable.  After the first few chapters, it is very apparent what the obligatory climactic showdown must be, and the novel plods steadily towards it. <br /> <br />If this book had an interesting style or a decent theme to tie everything together, it would have been a great book.  Instead it's just your standard thriller with some of the weirdest random elements you will ever come across.
0385512104|3.0|While I agree that a large part of this novel was overwhelmingly intimate and interesting, OVERALL it seemed to forget where it was going.  If you're just really into character development, then this is a MUST...however, if you're like me and you want to see that amazing character actually go through changes and watch as a PLOT unfolds before them, then you might find this very intriguing book a bit of a let down.   <br /> <br />If you're a quick reader, i reccomend this because it is a quick read and very unique.  I gotta at least give it that much credit, it was quite interesting in many ways.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|As other reviewers have said, this is Miyazaki's best, and one of <br />the best movies of all time, in any genre. <br /> <br />The new Disney DVD release is good.  The visuals are wonderful -- <br />great color, very crisp, very clean.  The transfer does justice to <br />Miyazaki's sweeping, highly detailed visual style. <br /> <br />The English dub is also quite good.  It's quite faithful to the <br />original dialog, with only a few cringe-inducing moments.  The <br />voice acting is sometimes rather flat, though, lacking the <br />emotional intensity that it deserves. <br /> <br />The audio is quite good, though the sound effects sometimes get <br />pushed farther down in the mix than they should. <br /> <br />Overall, the English translation, voice acting, and audio mix is <br />significantly better than that of the \\"Castle in the Sky\\" DVD. <br />Not quite as good as the original Japanese audio track, but very <br />listenable. <br /> <br />The DVD extras are pretty skimpy, but then with a movie this good, <br />who needs extras? <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B0007TKH66|5.0|I have seen virtually every single episode and I safely can say this is the best series since Deep Space Nine. This is how things were and why they are this way in the present. Even why Klingons did not use foreheads in the Original Star Trek. It took three seasons to developed these characters and seasons 3rd and 4th are the finest. Scott Bakula really put a lot of love for those trekkies. It will be a shame for UPN or Viacom not to continue this delightful well written saga (now with Judith and Garfield Reeves-Stevens for God's sake!). I agree that they wouldn't be in business today if it weren't for the past 39 years of Star Trek. <br /> <br />Grab these DVDs and prepare to start a woderful trip to the Final Frontier!!!!
B0000AQS6R|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Forget that though.  If I had given stars for this as a special edition I would only give it 1 star. <br /> <br />If you have the normal released DVD, this version is NOT worth double dipping. <br /> <br />I think everyone knows what this movie is.  If you don't have this on DVD then great.. grab this version.  If you already have a copy of the older version, don't get this one thinking you will be getting something special.   <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|1.0|This crap is the final stage of their gradual metamorphosis from one of the greatest and most original living bands on earth to sellout men with a deep, gargled, throaty croon that makes them sound like one of those old pros on the Vegas circuit who refuse to quit, merely altering tehir act to accommodate their gradual disintegration.  <br /> <br />So, another frustratingly inconsistent effort from one of pop's most frustratingly inconsistent artists - former great 80's and 90's band. No change there, then. <br /> <br />
B00005JNBQ|5.0|\\"Napoleon Dynamite\\" is among the surprising wave of successful independent films that America has seen over the past year.  It was written by Mormon filmmakers Jared and Jerusha Hess and directed by Jared Hess.  The film stars newbie Jon Heder in the title role, accompanied by a stellar cast including Jon Gries, Efren Ramirez, Aaron Ruell, and Tina Majorino. <br /> The story takes place in the quirky town of Preston, Idaho, where everyone seems to be inexplicably stuck in the fashions of the early 90's.  As for a substantial plot... the movie has little in this department.  The vague idea of a battle between the \\"popular kids\\" and the \\"geeks\\" is present throughout, but is not really the main focus of the film.  Napoleon Dynamite is more like a collection of various scenes from the odd life of one very strange boy.  The film reaches its peak with the student body president elections and the unconventional self-actualization of Napoleon himself. <br /> This film is, on the surface, a comedy geared towards a teenaged audience.  But, as the saying goes, this is not another teen movie.  It is refreshing in its originality.  Many teen films glorify the underdogs and the unpopular kids, but Napoleon Dynamite delves deep into the existence of those real people, the stereotypical \\"freaks and geeks\\", making no apologies for the great amount of painful awkwardness and cringe-worthy moments. <br /> Compared to other top movies of the season, Napoleon Dynamite may or may not be a worthy competitor.  It certainly has uniqueness going for it, not to mention an enormous cult following in both the teen and college age groups.  However, it may not appeal outside of the trendy, offbeat scene because it lacks typical blockbuster appeal.  While some see the film's lack of profanity, sex, or violence as a positive thing, this type of good clean fun doesn't always sell. <br /> So what is Napoleon Dynamite really trying to tell us?  While the aforementioned \\"power to the unpopular\\" messageis strong and loud, the film is by no means a tear-jerking homage to the little guys.  It seems to strive more for a good laugh and a quotably fun time with your friends.  However, the audience is not laughing at Napoleon so much as they are enjoying the fact that the main character can be so glaringly \\"un-cool\\" and still be so... cool!  The lovers of this film want to be Napoleon, and so the message becomes one of encouragement to revel in your own originality.  It's cool to be a dork now. <br />If you are surrounded by fans of this movie who quote it all day long and can't seem to talk about anything else, then you might have been avoiding it.  You may be thinking that it can't be all that great... And no one seems to be able to put their finger on exactly what makes this movie so fabulous.  In truth, Napoleon Dynamite is one of those movies that you will either love or hate.  So is it worth your time and money?  Absolutely.  There's a chance that it will be your favorite movie ever.  And if it's not, at least you got to see what all the fuss is about. <br />
0140277447|4.0|I will admit that I am only a Grade 12 student reading this book as part of a English project, however while reading the reviews of this book on Amazon.com I came across somebody saying that this is not forgotten history. When I presented my report to a class of average Canadian high school students many of whom were in my History 12 class were totally oblivious to such acts of violence and sadistic rape,murder and degredgation of the Chinese. I believe that however bias Chang's writing maybe at certain points it is only because any decent human being cannot or would have a hard time writing of such atrocities without providing a hint of anger and frustration as to the events of Nanking. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO EVERYBODY, it is very much a book that is important and informative, but at the same time it is written with graphic detail as the reader is bombarded with constant stories and depictions of rape,murder and mutilation.
B000268QB2|5.0|I bought Keane's Hopes and Fears after hearing \\"Somewhere Only We Know\\" one time...that's how powerful that song is.  There is not a single track on the album that isn't worth listening to, so you might as well buy the whole album and not buy single-music downloads...its worth in the long run. I am excited to have found this jem of a band before they become big (though they are huge in the UK now) and that others are picking up on the wonderful melodies, piano scores, and rhythms of Keane's debut album.
B0001932ZA|2.0|The Special Edition of \\"The Running Man\\" is FANTASTIC!  Although not true to the Richard Bachman (Stephen King) book it really is a good flick!  The picture and sound mastering are great, and the movie itself is escapism at its best!  Perfect direction by Paul Michael Glaser keeps the picture truckin', Arnold is good as the smart-alec hero, Richard Dawson is perfect as the sleazeball gameshow host and Maria Conchita Alonso gives a great performance as the love interest!  So why the two-star rating?  One of the extras, as noted by other reviewers is about \\"reality TV\\" and its impact on the American culture.  Using scenes from \\"The Running Man\\" coupled with scenes from today's \\"reality shows\\" could have been interesting, but the material as presented ended up BORING (nice for catching a few Z's after all the movie action).  The other extra mentioned by a lot of other reviewers is entitled \\"Lockdown On Main Street.\\"  I don't consider myself political, but this was just way too much.  It is a one-sided, offensive piece of \\"documentary\\" that I guess is supposed to awaken the sleeping masses over The Patriot Act and the destruction of individual rights.  I am offended not so much by the content of this \\"extra,\\" but rather by the fact this \\"extra\\" was slipped into a DVD that I bought for simple, honest, innocent enjoyment.  What is that you say?  If I don't like it, just don't watch it?  The point is that I did not intend to spend money to have this skewed view of American politics forced down my throat during an afternoon of movie enjoyment.  If Artisan feels they must include political comment in their DVDs, they must realize not everyone shares this point of view.  I recommend that Artisan recall this Special Edition DVD not for the sake of removing and censoring this garbage, but for the sake of balance by adding another point of view.  Personally, after viewing \\"Lockdown On Main Street,\\" I felt used and ripped off.  Torqued jaws?  You bet!  Artisan, just how much of the money plunked down by your customers for this DVD go to the company that produced this biased commentary?  Fortunately, \\"Lockdown On Main Street\\" is on one of the two discs in this set.  I am considering sending my copy of the offending disc back to Artisan and let THEM dispose of this junk.  Talk about the Big Brother-types trying to influence your life. . .  Do your blood pressure a favor and buy one of the other editions of \\"The Running Man.\\"
B000000H57|5.0|I'll admit, usually my tastes in music run to Thrash and Death Metal, but when I chanced upon this album (after seeing the video for \\"My Girlfriend's Girlfriend\\"), I knew I had struck gold!! Here's a little breakdown... <br /> <br />The Music: The whole Beatles/Black Sabbath thing has been said before, but it's true. The unforgettable melodies of the Beatles, and the imposing doom 'n gloom of vintage Sabbath. The songs veer from the poppiness of 'My Girlfriend's Girlfriend' to the sprawling majesty of 'Haunted' and all points in between. Probably my favourite thing about this album is that there are so many cool, weird noises buried in the mix, that every time you listen, you hear something different. You could spend YEARS trying to digest this. <br /> <br />The Lyrics: Sometimes creepy, sometimes humorous, always on the mark. And made all the better by Peter Steele's rich baritone delivery (and backed up by the Bensonhoist Lesbian Choir - I'm not making this up!!). <br /> <br />The Production: This is where it gets weird. Sometimes it sounds like it was recorded at Abbey Road, and other times it sounds as if it were tracked onto an old-school four-track in Josh Silver's garage. And how they manage to blend the two aesthetics so FLAWLESSLY is something I've pondered fruitlessly for many years. <br /> <br />The Performance: Although no one would ever accuse these guys of being virtuosos with regard to technicality, the sometimes straightforward approach lets the music BREATHE. They probably realised that an overly technical approach (of which they are fully capable of, as evidenced on their earlier stuff) would confuse an already complicated thing. <br /> <br />The Highlights: EVERYTHING! Well to be more specific, here goes... <br /> <br />Love You To Death - Beautiful, and hauntingly romantic. If your girlfriend happens to be a metal fan (as she bloody well should be!), pop this in the background, and enjoy one hell of a shagfest! <br /> <br />Green Man - Catchy ashell, with a very cool (albeit bizzarre) sample of a garbage truck at the beginning. <br /> <br />In Praise Of Bacchus - An awesome ode to the Roman god of wine, and always a great tune to get hammered to. <br /> <br />Haunted - Creeping slower-than-buggery doom-laden metal with a sprawling, poetic feel and (like most songs on this record) erotic overtones. <br /> <br />In Summary: This album is perfectly flawless. Although I dig \\"Bloody Kisses\\" and \\"World Coming Down\\", this album is where the 'O' hit their stride. And on a related not, if you're a heterosexual guy, AVOID ANY CONTACT with the Peter Steele Playgirl pics!! The absolute LAST thing you want to visualise when you put on this record is Peter's 'schlong'... it took me YEARS to erase that mental pic! Otherwise... ENJOY!!
B0002ZDVEU|3.0|This sequel to \\"The Bourne Identity,\\" had much less psychological tension. This time it's just chasing, fist fighting, and shooting. Most things that made \\"Identity\\" refreshing -- the wit, the incongruity, the uncertainty, the novelty of its premise -- are gone in \\" Supremacy.\\" That isn't bad, but it is disappointing for anyone who remembers what made the first movie so enjoyable. Greengrass, who directed this sequel, couples his approach with two acute mistakes in strategy: He consistently forgets to clue the audience in on basic information, such as who is shooting at whom, and why. And he films every action scene as though doing a behind-the-camera interpretive dance based on Don Knotts' classic performance in \\"The Shakiest Gun in the West.\\" That said, \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" is still definitely entertaining. More interestingly, it's a testament to Damon and what his physical presence somehow just conveys. The title, \\"Supremacy,\\" promises something it doesn't deliver, something further suggested by the advertising tagline, \\"They should have left him alone.\\" The title suggests a reversal of the first movie, with Bourne, in possession of himself and the facts, mounting an offensive against the people who've victimized him. But the movie is really a muddle. Bourne is improvising, getting shot at here, strangling somebody there. He has no system. There's really no villain, unless you count some nameless Russian assassin or poor Abbott, who is too much of a nervous wreck to inspire an audience's bloodlust. This whole spectacle of confusion could have been made into something with some ironic distance. But the only distance Greengrass creates is that which comes of bad technique: wobbly images, and blurred fragments. And we're in no position to appreciate the irony of the situation if we have no idea what's going on.  <br />
B000025XKM|5.0|Don't get me wrong by the title of this review I love this cd.  This is the most depressing cd Nick has done let alone any one has done, but I never felt depress because I listine to it.  It is amazing that he managed to record these songs consdering that he check his self in a metal instution shortly after finishing this album. It is also one of the few cds with only a voice and guitar that I can listen too alot of times.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I feel sorry for all the people who listened to the reviews of this film and decided it wasn't worth putting out the money to see; the critics did a great disservice to the public with their reviews of this film.  Anybody who did not have the chance to see this production sitting in a theater with a big screen and surround sound and have the opportunity to witnes the beauty of the color, costumes and have the passion of the Phantom envelope them has been cheated of a wonderful experience. <br /> <br />I have seen the stage production and the movie is soo much more, it's the difference between seeing it in 3D as apposed to 1 dimensional. <br /> <br />I have seen this movie 5 times and each time it was more wonderful. At this point I am going through withdrawals, as it is no longer showing in our local theater (I don't know if I can wait for May 3 and its DVD release). <br /> <br />Granted, Gerard Butler may not have the high tenor range of Michael Crawford, but his more masculine tones gives us a much more powerful and sensual Phantom.  Some may feel that he can not fill Michael's shoes, but I feel that his shoes are right beside Michael's, if not slightly ahead of them.  Christine was a wonderful, beautifull and innocent girl, but yet able to demonstrate the passion that the Phantom could invoke in her (Point of no Return duet). <br /> <br />I too shed tears at the end of the film 1) because it was over, and 2)for Christine for passing up the opportunity to share the love and the passion of the Phantom.
B0006399FS|1.0|Sticking to an insignificant music statement. Simply put, HTDAAB is the most disappointing record of U2's strong, lengthy career. <br />It suffers from Bono's weathered voice and many moments of their weakest writing ever. A lot of that has to do with Lillywhite's astonishingly uninspired production. However the sad truth is that this is an album dominated by filler tracks- all that 'A Man And A Woman', 'Original Of The Species', 'One Step Closer', 'Love And Peace Or Else', 'Yahweh', etc - and shows a band in need of a new wind. <br /> <br />What does HTDAAB have to distinguish itself? Nothing at all.  <br />It's U2 by numbers. Each track seems to blend into the nest with nothing to grab the attention. <br />The band sounds tired, the tunes have run out, the zest is gone. Even the packaging looks boring. <br /> <br />I got hooked on U2 far before they became the corporate/money machine they are now. <br />Listen to their incredibly under appreciated albums Zooropa and Pop instead. Rest In Peace U2, please!. <br /> <br />
B00000FCBC|4.0|When i first heard the album I was  blown away by the cover Turn The Page. Kirk's immitation of the sax is awesome.  The riffs on this album are superb...not many bands could cover this music and/or write solos etc that fit the way metallica did. Some songs are very fast and satanic others are mellow yet heavy. I have been playing guitar for 7 yrs and still cant play half of whats on the album. The made the songs more appealing to this generation. Its worth listening to ...
B00008CLOA|1.0|This is one of the best albums i ever heard.  But, like Hey Mo!! already indicated: The surround mix of the SACD is absolutely horrible compared to the original Alan Parsons quadrophonic mix.  Tha SACD mix has only added 'ambient effects', while the AP quad mix is really discrete and adds 3 extra dimensions to the album. <br /> <br />It's too bad that the AP mix is not available for the general public, so you can verify my opinion.  Let's hope this changes soon!
0671027387|1.0|I came into this book after reading the horrible religious \\"thrillers\\" \\"Davinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons.\\" I'm a fast reader. It took me two days to get through each of those cliched jumbles of crap.<br /><br />This book was on the shelves and I knew it had different characters (If Dan Brown knows what a real character is...) so I figured it might be better.<br /><br />The book talks about Rachel Sexton, a government employee who makes information accessible to those that don't speak the technological lingo. She gets summoned by the President of the United States to help break down the newest little tidbit of information: There's life on other planets!<br /><br />The biggest mistake Brown makes, as he did with the religious ideas presented in the other two of his books I read, is that he actually thinks a public would CARE about the main conflict he presents. Do any of you readers actually care about NASA? If you say \\"Yes, they're inefficient spenders,\\" than it's time you looked at the millitary.<br /><br />He stakes an entire election on one single issue: NASA. Ignoring the simple fact that no election in the history of any nation would ever ride entirely on one issue (with maybe, three exceptions in times of war or the Great Depression) Brown picks a positively rediculous basis for his...well, I dunno if you'd really call it a story, but it's rediculous at any rate.<br /><br />Of course, as anyone who looked even a little bit into the accuracy or writing skill of any of Brown's other works, ignoring simple facts is what he does best. He ignores the blatant need for real characters and dynamic personalities. Rachel Sexton reads like a female Robert Langdon. He ignores the need for actual plot development. He dangles his pathetic little \\"deception\\" in front of his readers like a carrot on the string leaving the reader to realize at the end of the novel that all he ends up with is a lousy carrot. That is to say, he did that with the other two.

B0006IUDXA|3.0|This is a great TV series, but I do have to agree with other posters here that the transfer is terrible. For such a high demand TV series to be released on DVD I was sorely dissapointed in the transfer, and the lack of bonus features. Thankfully there are several seasons left to find features in, but I do hope they decide to start using a better transfer for this series, I think we fans have waited long enough and deserve a good transfer.
B000001DQG|2.0|The only reason to buy this CD is for \\"I've seen the saucers\\" and \\"Dont let the sun go down on me\\"....in my personal opinion...the only 2 songs worth listening to.....<br /><br />This album was a complete flop...compared to the epic GOODBYE YELLOW BRICK ROAD and everything that preceeded it.....I think the falling out between Elton and Bernie contributed to its failure......Elton is a great musician and performer but his song writing ability leaves alot to be desired.
B000002L71|5.0|This is essential because it draws from their very best material, and the songs have never sounded this good.  \\"once in a lifetime\\" is particularly improved, giving it a harder edge compared to the studio version, but you will find all of the songs are very well arranged live.  It doesn't really sound like a live album, its so good.  If you are new to the band get this and the newly released The Name of the Band is Talking Heads, another great live album.  Or you could opt for the Best Of disc instead.  I am having a hard time deciding between the two, actually.  But I have no doubt that this is a necessary musical document of the greatest band of the 80's.
B000096IBI|5.0|This movie in my opinion was Charlie's best work ever. It's really close to The Great Dictator though. What a genius! He's the greatest actor that ever lived!!!!
B000002KHF|5.0|I would make this an essential purchase for all music fans! especially \\"caravan,\\" which is one of the best songs he's ever made and one of the only songs that never seems to get old when I listen to it a lot!  People may talk a lot about Astral Weeks as being better, but it is not as consistent as this album.  For some reason people also say that Tupelo Honey is better, but I found almost everything on that album to be monumentally cheesy, and far below The Man's high standards.  If you are just getting into Van Morrison, make this your first purchase, you will like all of the songs on this disc!  Then get Best Of vol 1 for the rest of his essential songs, and maybe Astral Weeks, though I suggest you listen to that one first before you buy it.  Then the magic of Van Morrison will be yours to savor!
1400043662|5.0|Every once in a while you read a book that gets deep into the marrow of your bones, and \\"Kafka at the Shore\\" is such a book for me.  It is essentially a book about the mystery of time, and the magic of metaphor.  The whole of it is a metaphoric poem, a post-modern version of the Oedipus myth as it unfolds in the life of Kafka Tamura, the 15 year old protagonist.  Summaries of the book sound silly and odd--talking cats, fish falling from the sky, Colonel Sanders as a pimp, a man who eats cat's hearts and makes a flute from their souls, but it is none of these odd plot elements that makes it so powerful.  Rather it is the book's metaphoric power--how we see the whole of life and death in it--suffering, loss, desire, love, promise, fate and all conditions in between.  It takes us to the edge of the world and brings us back deeply enriched and nourished. It propels us into what Murakami calls \\"the pure present,\\" in one of the best pair of sentences I've come across in a while: \\"The pure present is an ungraspable advance of the past devouring the future. In truth, all sensation is already memory.\\"
B0006399FS|2.0|I have never liked U2 very much, and this album reaffirms why.  The production on this album is just a mess, I am SO glad I didn't buy it.  I would say that \\"vertigo\\" and \\"all because of you\\" are reasonable efforts, but I would never consider buying them, I just listen to them a bit on the radio.  What an overhyped band!!  If you want to check them out in a time when they made interesting music, get the Joshua Tree album.  That is the only necessary U2 purchase in my book, besides maybe All That You Can't Leave Behind, except I think that album is pretty boring also, but not nearly as boring as this lame cd!
0316172324|1.0|In a blink...\\"BLINK: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking\\" is a rip-off! Malcome Gladwell's \\"BLINK\\" had  a great review in the New York Times and was (is?) a top seller. However, I was so under whelmed after reading it that I passed the book on, without comment, to a couple of friends, (possibly ex-friends now) for their reactions. It could be that I was missing something. One of my pals later told, me in describing his thoughts on \\"BLINK\\", that this tome was exactly what the philosopher Harry Franfurt was describing in his book, \\"On Bull....\\". The author of \\"BLINK\\" has scraped together some university \\"studies\\" to give credence to his dissertation. By puffing out the studies and inserting some personal observations he managed to fill some two-hundred odd pages with pap. I had been scammed. Here, in my opinion, is the encapsulated wisdom to be gleaned from \\"BLINK\\" and what you should know before starting the read: If you carefully observe what you are doing while repeating the same process over, and over, and over, you will one day be able to repeat the process without a lot thinking...sort of an intuitive thing. It's kinda like shooting a basketball.It's Pavlov, basic 101 Pavlov.   The implied benefit to you will be an ability to recognize these processes within, let's say, maybe, two seconds or a \\"BLINK\\" of the eye. Oh yeah, the writer also throws in some personal grievances about an entertainer friend(?) of his who gets panned by critics and trys to lead you into concluding that they must be some kind of music bigots.  The only benefit in reading this rip-off is that I should be on my way to recognizing literary nothingness within a \\"blink\\". <br /> <br />
B0002X314C|5.0|I haven't purchased a CD since the Black Album, and before that, probably not since the year before that...  <br />All I can say is I chose a good one to go out and buy. VIBE was right in certifying it a classic. I put the entire CD on repeat every morning and never get tired of it. <br />I even sent a copy to an older friend and he loves it too!
B0002X314C|5.0|John Legend has basically recorded an album that represents R&B in its purest and most classic form. It's like taking a great trip back to the 70's, but with a modern vibe. I'm not going to compare John to all of the great R&B singers before him, because his work stands alone. He is casting a very formidable shadow. This guy is far from being manufactured. No glossy marketing schemes, just pure talent and pure soul. There's no way to package him without putting his talent out front. This is one R&B singer that will be standing on his own two feet for a long time. <br /> <br />From the moment he lets go of the first note, you know this is going to be good. He's not playing around with the music either. This guy is serious. He's come to make a lasting impression. You'll get to know his voice and his style. No mistaking him for someone else. He's about as sharp as they come. You can tell he's worked hard for this and deserves every ounce of praise.  <br /> <br />When it good, it's good. You can't deny it.  <br />
B0000027I6|5.0|Roger Waters' critical lens of scrutiny expands from the demons of one man engulfed in a lucid dream on \\"The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\\" to the demons that haunt our larger societies in \\"Radio Kaos\\" and \\"Amused to Death.\\" \\"Amused to Death\\" is particularly poignant in taking a direct approach to themes of war, religion, oppression, civil strife, altruism, and hope.     Although his voice sounds particularly desiccated in this release, Roger Waters shines once again with lyrics that cut to the bone. Few artists have such a knack for tearing humanity's wretched heart out, showing its gruesomeness to all of those willing to see and then gently placing that heart back into humanity's chest making us all better off for the experience. Particular highlights of this release were:    Ballad of Bill Hubbard - An ambient fugue in which an interview with a war veteran delves into his personal experience with helplessness and the frailty of human life    Perfect Sense 1 - A quiet, reflective piece that exposes us for what we are - primates that are all to happy to kill our fellow beings under the guise of warfare for profit and glory. Of course we need prodding from religion, our leaders, and our financial institutions but ultimately, we justify the mean with the ends.       Late Home Tonight 1 -  The film \\"Top Gun\\" done up from the perspective of not just the American slicky boy pilot but an oblivious women in England about to drink her tea and the targeted civilians in Tripoli that he just aimed a laser-guided missile at.    Three Wishes - Utterly tragic. It starts with an interview with a woman who asphyxiated her kids by opening a gas bottle while they slept. The lyrics then relate how a man finds a bottle and rubs it releasing a street-smart genie who grants him three wishes. The man wishes for happiness in Lebanon, help with writing his song, and that his father had not been absent while growing up. However, he forgets to ask a genie to bring back a women (girl friend? wife?) who is either missing or dead. The song ends with the man pleading for another wish while the genie saying \\"tough luck\\" and disappearing back into the bottle. Despite having three of his desires met, the man is still miserable at the end because of his oversight. Its a familiar theme for all of us and indicative of one of Buddha's four noble truths - existence is suffering and that suffering arises from desire.
068987474X|2.0|I purchased this book due to all of the rave reviews it was given.  However, I am a little disappointed.  Once I was half way into the book, I began to realize that the book was only explaining what us ladies already know.  We have been through so much when it comes to dating/relationships, that I think we all can write a book like this.  In conclusion, I missed my calling.....I could've wrote this book myself!!!!!! <br /> <br />Stephanie in Indiana
B0006J28L4|4.0|which was how Spike Lee was quoted after Denzel didn't win the Oscar for best Actor of that year. I agree, and when you consider that Denzel did win a Oscar for Training Day. you have to wonder what denotes a great performance. This is a MUST-SEE film for people who a)Think that all Malcolm X represented was violence, a history of drug Dealing, ex-con b) That think that people can't change and c) the power of education. It is a long film, but didn't feel that way to me(I saw it twice at the cinema, and was moved to tears on both ocassions) Spike's Best film to date, which so far he has not surpassed.
B0006IUDXA|4.0|I had a lot of fun viewing the first season of this legendary TV show! For some reason, there's a bunch of us 30-year-olds out there who have been seeking-out the TV shows of our youth (and MacGyver ranks right up there, alongside shows like The A-Team). Fortunately for us, the 21st century comes equipped with DVD box sets!<br /><br />That being said, I'm forced to agree with some previous reviewers: this box set falls short in comparison to all the other DVD box sets I've seen. There are no extras whatsoever, and that's unfortunate. It would have been nice to hear Richard Dean Anderson's comments, or have held interviews with the guest stars (a very young (and cute) Teri Hatcher appears as Penny Parker in \\"Every Time She Smiles\\" and Trek fans will recognize Q (John de Lancie), who appears in \\"The Escape\\"). Speaking of Star Trek, it's funny that Paramount spared no expense with the Star Trek: TNG box sets (granted, that show has a very demanding fan-base), but MacGyver's set is a complete 180 degrees...a bare-bones box set that doesn't do the show's reputation justice (it seems Paramount wants us to pay over $100 per-season before they add bonus material).<br /><br />Nevertheless, Season 1 is worth it. Inconsistent acting, campy scripts and bad stock footage of foreign locales aside, it still brought back good memories. However, I'm really anticipating future box sets of MacGyver (I saw an episode on TV Land not too long ago (an episode from a later season) and it was an all-around better production). Next time though, let's see if Paramount can round up some of the gang for a \\"special features\\" section!
B0000549B2|5.0|and being blown away. Firstly was the music. At the time I was a real hip hop  new jack swing remember that)head. Could never really get into Jazz. This film started my voyage of Discovery, which has led me to Jazz Guitar Artists. Secondly, to me, it shows a man that thought his whole world would fall apart with out his so called 'First Love'(music) only to discover that life had much more to offer him. I don't want to give a running commentary of the film, but I would highly recomend it, and you should also peep this soundtrack, and Book of the making of the film.
B000002KIE|5.0|This is and always will be a fantastic, must-have album, but please do yourself a favor and get the import and not this very poorly mastered Warner Brothers version. This version has no treble and lots of hiss.
B000063S6Z|5.0|While going through what was one of the hardest times in my life ,to say the least (the gradual decline of my Aunt and her passing of life from this world), this album happened to find its way into my stereo. Being a big fan of Moby's previous releases, this album didnt quite hit me over the head like 'Play' did. But upon a few listens to this album you can feel the pains of one persons soul help ease the pain of your own. Having the reassurance that others have felt the pain that you have experienced is kind of a breath of fresh air into a somewhat lonesome time.  <br />'In This World' and 'One of These Mornings' are haunting melodies that capture loneliness and loss in a beautiful arrangement. 'At Least We Tried' gives a bittersweet look upon failed relationships and a new outlook on some bad landscape. But above beyond the other tracks, 'Im Not Worried at All' sends chills down my bones with a small dose of a pat on the back. Making the emotional rollercoaster that is '18' end with tears in my eyes and a smile on my face. I would highly recommend it to anyone experiencing the pitfalls of life and death and wouldnt mind a familar hand guiding them through the rockiness.
076781326X|3.0|Don't get me wrong, Oliver is a fabulous musical.  A great adaptation of Charles Dickens classic.  My 3 stars for this is because the DVD could have been so much better.  First of all this is advertised as the 30th Anniversary edition.  Well where are the extras?  An Oliver reunion, or making of commentary with the stars would have been such a great addition.  My understanding is all of the leads are still alive and breathing.  Why didn't you get them for this?  Also....BIG complaint.....If Titanic, which is over 3 hours long, can be put on one side of a DVD then WHY did this movie have to be put on two sides?  When watching a movie I do not want to have to get up, eject the DVD, turn it over and start part two.  That should have gone out with Laserdiscs.  VERY BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!  Alll in all , a great movie.  Hopefully for the 40th Anniversary the studio will re-release this THE RIGHT WAY!
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Shes back and so am I. If youve read my review on Ashlee Simpson and other Rockish or Punk artist than you know it is that music i favor. In this album Avril has Obvioaly been through breakups and back.It Speaks of lost and letting go (duhh its in the title). I do recomend this album it gives you a sence of happiness in some and it gives you songs to cry to if youre in the mood (ie if you have broken up with someone). It is a great album. PICK IT UP!
B00005JSGK|5.0|This is the story of Sean Mercer (John Wayne) and his pals who live in Africa and catch animals for zoos.  A photographer (Elsa Martinelli) visits and everyone is surprised (and delighted) to find that she is a beautiful woman.  She's attracted to Sean and he likes her, too, although he won't admit it.<br /><br />There is plenty of wild animal action (the actors really did catch the animals), fun, and innocent romance, too. John Wayne has one of his best roles as the rugged he-man who acts all dopey around a pretty girl. German heartthrob Hardy Kruger is the reason I watch this movie over and over again.  Miss Martinelli is very good as the Italian beauty who falls for Sean and is the object of two baby elephants' affections, as well.<br /><br />The whole family can enjoy the breathtaking animal scenes, the strong bond of friendship shared by the hunters, and the adventure of living in Africa.  Heartily recommended.

B0002VJIGY|5.0|I have seen this mini-serie on HBO, in my country, Brazil and I have LOVED it! I have readen Victor Hugo's Les Miserables several times and I have seen almost all the movie-screen versions of this romance and I can assure all that it is the best one! First, it follows the twists and turns of the book with almost meticulous details. Second, G&eacute;rard Depardieu is the PERFECT Jean Valjean, almost to the bones of his crooked nose and slightly hunched back (read his description in Victor Hugo's book!) Liam Neeson is too elegant and too handsome to fit this description!!! Third,  as Les Miserables comes, longer is better, because there is so much to tell, so many nuances that the shorter versions do not show! And I would go on and on because that is one of my favorite books and this movie is my favorite version. A plus: John Malkovich as Inspector Javert is ousttanding and Christian Clavier as Th&eacute;nardier oh, that is a trio you will not easily forget. Another movie made by the three of them is NAPOLEON, with Christian Clavier as Napoleon, John Malkovich as Taillerand (chilling as a machiavellian politician !) and Depardieu as Fouch&eacute;, a minor role, but very important in the plot. If you REALLY want to see the very best version of LES MISERABLES see this movie. You will not regret the almost 7 hours of duration. To know the best of Victor Hugo go to the French versions! Hollywood may do great action movies but the classical...I prefer the French adaptations!(That is not a prejudice, but compare, if you will, the Hollywood version with Liam Neeson with this meticulous and very literary French version with G&eacute;rard Depardieu and you will agree with me.That is the same with the Count of Monte-Cristo, starred by the same G&eacute;rard Depardieu. Oh, well, if you can see a movie starred by G&eacute;rard Depardieu I garantee it will ALWAYS be a good one, because Mr. Depardieu is one of the finest actors of our times.
0446530573|1.0|As an Italian-American, I cringe at anything associated with the continued presentation of this ethnic group as stupid, violent, abusive gangsters. Why other Italian-Americans want to take part in and further promote this stereotype is beyond me.
B0002Y4TM4|4.0|I finally broke down and bought this album fearing it would be like marillion.com. I have to admit I didn't hate it as I thought I would. As a matter of fact, I quite liked it. It is a return to form...parts suggests elements of Brave and Seasons End and most of it has a real good feel to it. I eat my words... shame on me for discounting this band. Check these Marbles out!
B000066I6N|4.0|Robert Plant's Dreamland gives me the perfect excuse to go off on a rant about Classic-Rock Radio.  Every radio market in America has at least one of these, the ones for whom time began around 1968 with the advent of psychedelic rock and ended ca. 1977 with the advent of Punk.  The stations playing songs from a decade earlier than Classic Rock's birth at least have the honesty to call themselves Oldies stations.  Meanwhile, the good old Classic Rock stations stay stuck in their endless, mindless time-warp loop of \\"Led Zeppelin A-to-Z Weekends\\" and \\"Let's roll some dice and see how many songs in a row to play by the Floyd Boys.\\"  What gets me about those stations is that I can understand their reluctance to play anything recorded since the invention of the CD.  I disagree with them 100% but at least I understand the (closed) mindset.  It is, after all, called Classic Rock for a reason, so it should be classic right?  But what gets me is the way they turn on their own idols, worshipping only the fading black and white images of careers that are still extant and in some cases even vital.<br /><br />Which brings me to Mr. Plant.  Turn on a radio just about anywhere and spin the dial and you'll find Plant's three-decades-old work with Led Zep playing.  But why in the name of all that is good and proper, is \\"Darkness Darkness\\" not played in heavy rotation?  So the geezers love \\"Kashmir\\" so much it's practically a religion, while that song's spiritual descendent, and a hell of a great tune, gets ignored.<br /><br />Dreamland is mostly made up of covers of old blues and folk songs, given the full-on psychedelic treatment, usually of the heavy variety.  36 years after he started, Plant is still reinterpreting classic blues songs like Bukka White's \\"I Believe I'm Fixin' to Die\\" exactly like he did back in the day.  Only these days he gives proper credit to the original songs authors.  The aforementioned \\"Darkness Darkness\\" was originally by the Youngbloods, and while I've never heard it I imagine it sounds little like the pachouli-scented skullcrusher that it becomes in the hands of Plant and his talented band (which includes former Cure guitarist Porl Thompson!)  Ditto for the warhorse \\"Hey Joe,\\" done a thousand times before but almost unrecognizable in this blasting psyche-out version.<br /><br />Plant does bring down the room with a beautiful and heartfelt version of Tim Buckley's \\"Song to the Siren\\" and the closing \\"Skip's Song\\" by legendary Moby Grape co-founder Skip Spence, but the overall feel of this CD is heavy psych-blues with Middle Eastern overtones at times.  in fact if this CD has one flaw it might be the overly psychedelic feel which can make a stone-cold sober person dizzy.  Perfect if you're in the mood for it, but a bit more of the levity of \\"Skip's Song\\" might have made it a slightly better CD.<br /><br />Robert Plant is still making great music, still challenging himself, still fronting a great band.  Lord knows he doesn't need the money, so my hat is off to him for refusing to become a Vegas act.  You have to respect his continuing determination to matter.  But I wonder how many people know he still matters, and I largely blame the cold robotic churn that American Radio has become.e never heard it I imagine it sounds little like the pachouli-scented skullcrusher that it becomes in the hands of Plant and his talented band (which includes former Cure guitarist Porl Thompson!)

B0000089A1|5.0|I own every single studio album that The Kinks ever made, and I would have to say that this album is my absolute favorite (\\"Think Visual\\" follows a close second).<br /><br /> So...what's so darn good about this album? Practically everything! You want some nice pretty melodic ballads? Check out \\"Get Back In Line\\" and \\"A Long Way From Home\\". You want some out and out raucous heavy metal tunes? Listen to \\"Rats\\" and \\"Powerman\\". You want a nice, fun calypso tune? Listen to \\"Apeman\\", one of the funniest songs Ray Davies ever wrote. The country and bluegrass like guitar playing on \\"The Contenders\\" and \\"Got To Be Free\\" pointed the way toward their next album Muswell Hillbillies. And if acoustic folk is your cup of tea, then there's \\"This Time Tomorrow\\".<br /><br />LOLA may be Ray Davies and The Kinks at their most angry. Throughout the album, Ray rants and raves about the music business and how bad he's been ripped off by his publishers. For \\"The Moneygoround\\", another hilarious song, Ray actually mentions the names of people who have ripped him off. If he REALLY wanted to be nasty, he would have given out their addresses and phone numbers as well! Even Dave gets in on the act, with the aforementioned \\"Rats\\". Speaking of Dave, this song and the wonderful ballad \\"Strangers\\" may be the two best songs he has ever written..at least in my not so humble opinion.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Ray speaks of how \\"people want you when your record's hot, but when it drops down they just pass you by\\" in the crunch rocker \\"Top Of The Pops\\", which is another favorite tune of mine from this album. There are some very catchy and way cool guitar riffs on this song. And..I can't talk about this album without mentioning our dear friend \\"Lola\\", which became The Kinks' biggest hit in the U.S. in many a year. What more can be said about this enjoyable tune that hasn't been said before, except that it is a fun, upbeat song about a transvestite that you just can't get out of your noggin! The only tune on the album that I can live without is \\"Denmark Street\\". Both lyrically and musically, I find this a rather unappealing tune.<br /><br />But golly...only one bad song on the whole album? That's mighty good for this band! This is a great album and it has not dated one bit. A must have for Kinks' fans...at least for this one!ve without is \\"Denmark Street\\". Both lyrically and musically, I find this a rather unappealing tune.    But golly...only one bad song on the whole album? That's mighty good for this band!

B000006CCG|5.0|(My review scale: 1- Bad, 2- Average, 3- Good, 4- Very Good, 5- Excellent/Classic)    Of course it was easy to be fresh if you were WASP in 1984, and that's what this furious debut was, even if it wasn't completely original.  WASP's debut fits alongside Ratt's, Out of the Cellar; Quiet Riot's, Metal Health and Motley Crue's, Shout at the Devil, in terms of 80's metal impact!  It is a masterpiece of melodic metal pounding!    WASP, fronted by Blackie Lawless (who's only former claim to fame was being a member of the New York Dolls for about 10 minutes) came storming out of the L.A. club scene with the kind of reputation reserved for criminals.  Stories of their wild stage show, featuring naked women chained to racks, raw meat, beheadings, and discount ticket prices for fans showing up at shows with a pint of blood (all donated to the Red Cross) made WASP legends before they ever had a record deal.  A hard legend to live up to, but with this 1984 release, man, did they EVER live up to the billing.  The bottom line here is that while it could be easy to dismiss WASP due to their over the top theatrics, there's not a single throwaway track on this album!!!    You start with the ultimate WASP anthem, \\"I Wanna Be Somebody\\", which is among the best metal songs of all time.  Then the almost as catchy \\"L.O.V.E. Machine\\", which came along with a video that video channels refused to play in many countries, including Much Music in my own beloved Canada. (It does get airplay 20 years later on the Much Loud channel)    Smoking rocker \\"The Flame\\" continues side one's relentless pace, as it stretches Blackie \\"Doom Brother\\" Lawless' vocal range.   Side one ends off with good rockers, \\"B.A.D.\\" and \\"School Daze\\".    From the good old vinyl days, side two of this disk just keeps blasting!  \\"The Hellion\\" is furious energy!  \\"Sleeping (In the Fire) is a nice power ballad.  The last three songs on this disk just COOK!  \\"On Your Knees\\" is one of their best, while \\"Tormentor\\" foreshadows Blackie's future sound a bit.  The album closes with the heavy and fast, \\"The Torture Never Stops\\".      This album is just so damn good!   It features the original and BEST lineup of the band, Blackie, Randy Piper, Chris Holmes and Tony Richards.  Leather, studs, bolts, nails, chainsaw codpieces, blood, sex, violence, lunacy...and rock and roll!  This special 80's Metal release will always be among my faves!  The added songs on the CD release are totally unnecessary.  Buy it!
B00005Y228|5.0|I never thought that this CD would be as great as I thought it would but I was way wrong! This is an absolutely fantastic CD and is a highly uplifting and fun dance CD to listen to even if the cheese factor is blatant here. The dance hit \\"Can't Get You Out of My Head\\" was a well deserved comeback hit and is FAAAR better than that awful \\"Loco Motion\\" cover version of the 1980s. But the massive hit isn't the best of this CD. My favorite tracks are \\"More More More\\", \\"Come Into My World\\" and my top favorite song is the beautiful classic \\"Fragile\\" which combines dance house music with beautiful melody to create the near perfect summer anthem. I never thought I would even look at her catelog but this CD has now etched Minogue into my memory forever. Highly recommended!
B000002UA9|5.0|The early Beatles are fun to listen to only because they were new to music and the tunes were cute.  Their early music sounded 1950's, which is the main reason why I gravitate towards their later work (from Rubber Soul on).<br /><br />The Boys harmonized like no one else could (then or now) and they took control of their instruments and their audience from start to finish.<br /><br />That's what makes The Beatles the greatest group of musicians ever (despite the uninformed opinion of certain folks who are desperate for attention and feel the need to post immature \\"reviews\\" that have zip to do with the Beatles' music).
B0006J28KU|5.0|This is a superior film in every way--direction, writing, acting, cinemetography, music.  I would say one of the top 5 movies from the 90s along with PULP FICTION, GOODFELLAS, SHORT CUTS, and BOOGIE NIGHTS. Although you could say Pacino hams it up ever since SCENT OF A WOMAN, he is a good counterpoint to DeNiro's internalized method.  If you liked COLLATERAL, then you will love HEAT.  There is nothing I did not like about HEAT.<br /><br />The ending was heartbreaking but had to be that way.  Michael Mann has always been underrated, but at least the studio put out a fantastic DVD with excellent special features; I am not sure how many crack pipe hits the last guy took who said this is a lousy DVD.  A lot of care went into the movie, likewise with these new documentaries.  A valuable asset to any decent DVD collection.
B000002UDB|5.0|Everything the boys touched turned to platinum (forget gold) and Magical Mystery Tour was certainly no exception.<br /><br />The movie was VERY far out (you can see John all over it) but 1967 was a very trippy year.  But don't read too much into the movie's plot, folks (it actually was a made-for-TV special for the BBC, but let's not get technical): It's about a bunch of folks who were taken on a \\"mystery trip\\" to the English countryside with a camera crew and the cameras rolled until something happened.  That's it - nothing more, nothing less.<br /><br />The soundtrack is excellent work considering the fact that they just came off the phenomenal success of Sgt. Pepper.  Any other group would have suffered from creative burnout.<br /><br />The song on this album that will always remain dear to me is \\"Strawberry Fields Forever\\" as it was the song that introduced me to the greatest group of musicians that ever was or will be.  Period.
B000002H97|5.0|This cd is what every metalhead headbanger should get. this is their second album with their new bassist Jason Newsted (who quit the band and went to another). This album proves that they are the biggest metal band of all time, with tracks like Enter Sandman, Of Wolf And Man, and Sad but True. This albumis even good for Yankee fans, if you like Enter Sandman, which is played at Yankee games, and trust me, you'll know it when you hear it. <br />
B000002UB6|3.0|It's strange that this was recorded BEFORE Abbey Road but released after (due to all the legal squabbles the group was having at the time) because the sound of the album says it all: None of them were interested in the group anymore (a splinter that occurred during the making of that other \\"masterpiece\\" known as the \\"White Album\\").<br /><br />It was a shame to see The Boys go down the way they did: Embroiled in legal disputes, rancor between all of them for a few years after their official breakup, and putting out music that showed that they could have cared less.<br /><br />Since this album was the soundtrack to the film of the same name, and it turned out like this, imagine the end result of the film with the constant fighting and bickering (The Beatles would have officially been the pioneers of reality TV).<br /><br />Anyway, this is good to have only to complete your collection of their 13 studio albums.  Other than that, \\"Let It Be\\" is NOT the album of choice I'd use to introduce people to THE greatest group of musicians that ever was or will be (and those who don't like it: Get bent . . . sideways!).
B000002UJQ|5.0|This is simply one of the best albums ever made. It did not only impact our generation but it will always be remembered and enjoyed by generations to come. It is almost perfect. And I'm not saying this because I am obsessed with radiohead either. As a matter of fact I'm taking a break from listenig to them right now because I just became a little burned out. I actually haven't even listened to this recording for over a year. But I'll never forget the impression it left on everyone including myself. This is an album that you will not just listen to for a brief period in your life, but one that you will always come back to.  <br />Most people know who radiohead is, but if you are new, I suggest starting with their first album \\"pablo honey\\" Then you can move on subsequently and experience how the band has evolved from alt rock to experimental rock to ambient electronic rock and so on.
B000002UAU|5.0|I'm not a musicologist but I know a good album when I hear one and this is it.<br /><br />Sgt. Pepper deserves every bit of hype it has received over the years not only because it was an innovative album (it took over 500 hours to record, which was completely unheard of in the 1960's) but because it has stood the test of time.  Besides the fact that this is an album you can constantly listen to and never tire of, it's one of those rarities that every time you listen to it you gain something new from the experience.<br /><br />Every song tells a story, the cover is in a class all by itself, and everything just flows like an album should.<br /><br />You cannot be a true Beatles fan and not own this masterpiece.
0399242600|5.0|She has just started bringing me a couple of books that she particularly likes for me to read to her regularly; this is one of them. I make up sound effects and extra dialogue as I'm reading and she has me read it to her twice in a row - one of her favorite books --
B000002UAI|5.0|You can tell they were tired from the craziness of the mania just by looking at their forlorn faces on the cover.<br /><br />Despite the beyond hellish touring they were doing in 1963 and 1964, along with all the appearances on TV shows and the countless photo shoots and radio interviews they were obliged to do, Lennon-McCartney managed to squeeze in more classic compositions on this album: \\"No Reply,\\" \\"I'm A Loser,\\" and \\"Baby's In Black,\\" for example, brought home the point that they were in burnout mode.  The number of covers they included on this (7, counting the medley of \\"Kansas City\\" and \\"Hey, Hey, Hey, Hey\\" as two songs) was the most they had of any other album.<br /><br />Again, I tend to shy away from their earlier work (I like things from Rubber Soul onwards, except the \\"White Album\\") but I enjoy Beatles for Sale because of the depth of the Lennon-McCartney tunes.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|What do people expect in a movie?  This is pure entertainment.  Not perfection. <br />The characters were excellent - and droll - and in some cases, gross. <br />This is great fantasy! Without being offensive! <br />Van Helsing's blades are a bit remaniscent[?] of the Predator's blades.  Go, guys! <br /> <br />chuckle. Guess Dracula's offspring had as much chance of survival as the Alien Queen's did. <br /> <br />This is one I will be viewing again - I know I must have missed some neat parts. <br /> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED [especially if you have been a comic buff] this is great guns. <br />
B000002UAC|5.0|It was good then and it remains so to this day (yeah, 40-plus years later).<br /><br />The Boys' cash cow (sort of) was the proverbial teenypopper, bubblegum music in 1963 so they stuck with it.  But Lennon and McCartney did manage to churn out classics such as \\"It Won't Be Long,\\" \\"All I've Got To Do,\\" and \\"Hold Me Tight,\\" among others.<br /><br />Of course, groups back then included the obligatory covers on their albums and The Boys did their part with, for example, \\"Roll Over Beethoven\\" and \\"You Really Got A Hold On Me.\\"  And though the 1950's laid the foundation for rock and roll (and was the very thing that made John, Paul, George, and Ringo want to play rock and roll in the first place), I tend to shy away from The Boys' early work because of the 1950's sound attached to it.<br /><br />Other than that, it's fun to listen to this album for the catchy tunes and fun lyrics.
B0001BKAEY|1.0|The first was incredible; the second (Reloaded) wasn't too bad for a sequel; the third was boring. <br /> <br />Trying not to be biased, but it did have a lot to live up too.  Unfortunately, this one just dragged on.  I had to force myself to watch it to the end, which is sad.   <br /> <br />The third is less confusing than the previous two, but also less exciting.  For an intelligent series, this one doesn't fit.   <br />Oh well, I'm sure the Wachowski bros. have some great things up their sleeves for future projects.

B0007GADZO|3.0|If you like Vai's old style, remember you had to re-check your premises with Fire Garden and learn to like Ultra Zone. \\"Real Illusions - Reflections\\" is the natural sequel to Ultra Zone because it's even more experimented.    Even with the new style, the album \\"borrows\\" moods and melodies from different points in Vai's discography:  - Flex-Able meets Alien Love Secrets and \\"Boston Rain Melody\\" in \\"K'm-Pee-Du-Wee\\" (track 4)  - \\"Little Aligator\\" up tempo in \\"Firewall\\" (track 5)  - \\"Fire Garden Suite\\" reinvented on \\"Freak Show Excess\\" (track 6)  - \\"The Riddle\\" revisited with synths in \\"Midway Creatures\\" (track 9)  - Sex and Religion melodies in \\"I'm your Secrets\\" (track 10)    So here's the album overview:   - GREAT instrumentals on tracks 1, 4, 6, 9  - the usual Vai (but remember he can play) on tracks 3, 5, 7, 10, 11  - funny Vai on track 8  - no point when track 2 passes by    A worthy mention to Billy Sheehan, who plays very precise and cool bass. Check \\"Freak Show Excess\\" all over, mainly the duet between 03:45 and 05:20.    Conclusions:  - If you like Vai no matter what he does, BUY the album - it's great.  - If you didn't like Ultra Zone, hey, have a full listening session before buying \\"Real Illusions - Reflections\\" and decide by yourself.
B0006M4SO6|1.0|I just don't get how there can be so much gushing admiration for a kaleidoscope of music that is tedious listening.  Yes, I've been a PMG fan right from the self-titled debut album in the late 70's, right through Offramp, Travels, First Circle, Talking, We Live Here, and Imaginary Day.  Five stars to all these titles.  But with Speaking of Now and The Way Up, I question what is really being said in the music.  Where are the beautiful melodies?  Where is the barely contained tension of Are You Going With Me?  The Way Up is a confused sequence of time and key changes that do not contribute to a cohesive message.  Listening to this album is like listening to a teenage kid who talks all of the time and doesn't speak in complete sentences.  What are you trying to say?<br /><br />Anyway, Pat if you're reading this, please know that your music has been a cornerstone of my musical experience since the 70's.  I wish you well, and I hope you will once again connect with the music in your heart.<br /><br />Cheers.
B000683VI4|5.0|I have to disagree with one of the reviews I just read. The book was half of what the movie was. I felt that the book left out WAY TOO MANY key parts that were in the movie. The book was short, to the chase, and didn't really create as many emotions for me as the movie did. <br /> <br />If you LOVE classic love stories, then you'll LOVE The Notebook. This is now one of my all-time favorite movies because it's true to life and makes you think when you're watching it. If you're lucky enough to have met and are with that one true love, then you'll definatly identify with the main characters.  <br /> <br />BOTTOM LINE: <br />Amazing movie!!
0380778556|5.0|I read the review from Barbara L Timmer, and was Highly dismayed to find that she had given away a large portion of the book.  I considered buying the book, but why bother now that I know who killed who. Thanks alot Barbara, for ruining this book which I was so excited to read! I hope Amazon takes my advice and removes your review.  If you have not read Rebecca, skip over her review.
B000268QB2|4.0|I'm a 19-year-old Black guy listening to Keane. Unlikely, by most people's standards, however, that alone should encourage anyone to give \\"Hopes and Fears\\" a listen. It's one of the most amazing debuts in Pop music within that last 10 years! Please pick up this CD, because you will play it constantly and it's great mood music. Cloudy day? Put on Keane. Rainy day? Put on Keane. Making love? You get the idea. By no means, however, get the idea that this is the only thing this CD is good for. It's simply great melodic pop music. <br /> <br />Favorite tracks: 'Somewhere Only We Know' 'We Might As Well Be Starngers' 'Everybody's Changing'  <br />
B000002KLG|5.0|This award-winning CD for \\"Best R&B Vocal Performance\\" at the 1980 Annual Grammy Awards is one of George Benson's most remarkable recordings produced by the great Quincy Jones. The legendary Frank Sinatra once described Mr. Jones as \\"a very talented man and one of the bright stars in the composing business.\\"  And he truly is one of them. I have enjoyed this recording since the Eighties when it first came out. This CD showcases the artistic qualities of Mr. Benson in vocals and guitar. He has proven once again his musical versatility by playing the guitar exquisitely and showing off his unique vocal cords as well.<br /><br />George has the backing of the greatest musicians on the jazz scene: Lee Ritenour (guitar), Herbie Hancock (piano), David Foster and George Duke (keyboards) and Paulinho Da Costa (percussion), to name a few.<br /><br />Listen to \\"Moody's Mood For Love,\\" and you will be enticed and transported back in time. It is the great saxophone/flute player James Moody's signature song, which is based on the popular song \\"I'm In The Mood For Love.\\"  Mr. Benson shares the spotlight with jazz vocalist Patti Austin on this beautiful duet and one of my personal favorites. The rest of my favorite tracks are \\"Love Dance\\" and \\"Turn Out The Lamplight.\\" All these three tracks are to die for and enough reason to own this wonderful CD.<br /><br />Put this CD on your changer and enjoy it with the company of good friends on a lazy Sunday afternoon High Tea, exchanging musical pleasantries, Benson's new-released CDs, concerts, or any interesting topics under the sun.<br /><br />Happy listening!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|First of all - I have loved this movie since I saw it in 1986 in Japan as a kid. I first saw images on a huge screen inside a mall in Tokyo. I gasped and oo'd and awe'd until my Japanese host family decided they had to take me to go see it. It is truly awesome on a big screen, even if you don't speak Japanese. <br /> <br />That being said, the disney release is the best of at least 3 translation/subtitled versions of Nausicaa that I have seen. They did a very good job of expanding the dialogue a little bit so that the plot is comprehensible.  <br /> <br />I will admit it has huge appeal to chicks. Being a chick I love the theme, love the heroine and I love how she's basically on no one's side - she's on the side of reason and sanity! How many heroes in most action flicks shout that the killing has to stop - how many stand up unarmed against what is wrong? That is what makes her so appealing to me. <br /> <br />The big powers in this world are nuts. Though some have commented that they seem dated and cold war like, I think some of it is quite topical to this day and age. These powers are fanatical and willing to kill each other indiscriminately and at any cost - that is probably a familiar thing in any era.  There are always little countries being threatened by bigger ones. There are always powers who think they are good, right and justified in what they do, no matter how powerful or big they are.
B000089RVX|5.0|Beautiful. Amy Lee's vocals make this band what it is. Each song is just as good as the last--the only CD I own where I can legitimately say I LOVE each and every song. <br />Also, don't try to compare Evanescence to Lacuna Coil, people. They are two different bands! And contrary to tne popular belief that Evanescence stole their sound, both bands released their early work around the same time. So get over it!!

He explores ways of powerfully getting our subconcious on our side. His decarations and physical involvement techniques might seem absurd to left brain,logically oriented people but they work.<br /><br />Readers of \\"Getting Thru to Your Emotions with EFT: Tap into Your Hidden Potential with the Emotional Freedom Techniques\\"<br />by Phillip Mountrose and Jane Mountrose (01 November, 1999)will be more sympathetic to Ekers's methods.<br /><br />I would also recommend \\"Awakening Intuition\\" by Mona Lisa Schulz for those who wish to explore the other way of learning--that of using the right brain forces like kinetic energy,repetition and meridian energy.Schultz also says that it is best to balance both sides of our brain so it it is not wise to go too far in either direction.<br /><br />In short the value of Harv's method is in the action,the experiential part. Try the whole package.<br /><br />I have been using his techniques successfully.In July 2005 I attended  the Millionaire Mind Intensive and not only thoroughly enjoyed the experience but appeciated how well Harv's total package of accelerated learning works. As an educator I have often been disappointed at the modern paradigm of teaching and training where often there is little engagement and participation from the learner.<br /><br />By the way don't some of you wonder why some countries are rich and some poor?<br /><br />The US is one of the richest countries in the world because there is a national myth that anyone can be a millionaire,a President or best selling author. Because there is this national mindset it produces more millionaires per capita than any other country.<br /><br />Canada and Mexico are right next door to th US and have similar or better natural resources but the is no national millionaire mindset.

B00006RINF|5.0|Comalies is truly a piece of art... but I cannot get around the vocals of Andi. He sucks, plain and simple. He's not as bad here as on earlier releases, but that's probably attributed to the magic of the studio. Christina on the other hand has such an amazing voice. I look forward to new material from them sometime soon!
B00005JN4H|3.0|This was a one of those movies that seems to go off track here and there.  Jimmy Fallon and Queen Latifah fans will see the best and the worst of both stars.  What you won't see is any consistency in this film.<br /><br />Taxi is a movie that seems to change directors from day-to-day filming; there are scenes that have all the excitement and star quality of a \\"Lethal Weapon\\", and there are scenes that have all the drabness of a daytime soap opera.<br /><br />Jimmy Fallon plays a cop who is not a very good driver and has an ex-girlfriend (so he says) for a boss.  Their banter is not the least bit entertaining, even though I believe it is supposed to be.<br /><br />Queen Latifah plays a bike courieor who finally gets her cabbie license.  QL is an excellent actress, and at times I almost felt like she was doing everything in her power to carry this film.  I think she is so appealing to the masses because she seems like such a \\"down-to-earth\\" person.  She has a real charm on the screen.<br /><br />Fallon's character has some truly funny moments: The huge pile-up of cars when he tries do commandeer a citizen's vehicle and his alcoholic mother are amusing, but these good spots are rare.<br /><br />The whole movie seemed to need a rewrite.  I didn't hate this movie, but I definitely didn't think it was all it could have been.  Queen Latifah and Jimmy Fallon are so talented that it takes an amazing script to utilize their talents.  I would advise them both to be more picky with their scripts.<br /><br />So all and all...If there is nothing else to buy or rent, try this movie.  I wouldn't make it my first choice.<br /><br />See ya next review.
B0006399FS|1.0|Kick me out of the cult. To be a true-blue, diehard member of a rock band's cult following there are certain unspoken rules. Perhaps the most sacred of which is to maintain that even the band's worst album is still a great piece of music. \\"I just don't like it as much as the other ones,\\" you may safely admit to other fans, who either nod or politely defend the work in question. But objectivity in rock cults is unheard of. That's why cults dwindle. Let's review this new (NEW?) U2 album: <br /> <br />Cheaply sentimental, a glibly sanguine bit of pap from a band that once explored places that hadn't already been squeezed dry of meaning. And it gets worse.  <br /> <br />After an outdated empty rock number 'Vertigo', there's the terrific badness of a 'With Or Without You' rip off called 'Miracle Drug'. Then, a spectacularly inept attempt at traditionally uplifting ballad 'Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own'. At this moment, it's clear U2 are just repeating themselves. 'Love and Peace Or Else' is an even more lackluster song. 'City Of Blinding Lights' is the only one decent melody, but it isn't the new 'Where The Streets Have No Name', nowhere near to be honest. 'All Because Of You' is like a bunch of 60 years old members of a dated band trying to remain young by playing their well known rock formula. The \\"B-side\\" of the album offers no weighty numbers. If you want to listen to 5 filler songs, try this. Those \\"B-side\\" songs bland, lacking musical and lyrical hooks.  <br /> <br />U2 just overcompensate for their gradual decrepitude by trying too hard, swinging for the fences and singing for Grammy, Super Bowl, etc. U2 love to perform at any main TV show. What a difference!. That proves their pathetic double standard, by the way, it's true: U2 are sellouts. While Bono cry for help for the poor Africa, he appears at any sellout event to promote any new U2 stuff.  <br /> <br />U2 are dead. <br />

B00005JKJA|5.0|For all of the idiots out there who can't think their way out of a wet paper bag, for all the morons who think an Adam Sandler movie is entertaining, for all the mindless robots who like to 'plop' down in front of the Almighty box with a bag of pork rinds and watch professional wrestling, for all of the fools who think Julia Roberts can act and all the rest of you who didn't 'get' this movie, I say stick to something simple, like  Police Academy XV because this movie is light years ahead of your sub-simian understanding. America is doomed
B000024D4R|4.0|Did I mean to give this 4 stars?  Yes.  I like long songs.  Echoes and Atom Heart Mother are some of my favorites.  I especially like Jethro Tull's Thick As A Brick and A Passion Play (some times).  But Animals...there is something about Animals that just gets old.  Pigs On The Wing (both parts) are pretty good, and Pigs (Three Different Ones) is excellent!  But Dogs is just exhausting.  It's just too repetitive seeming to me and not enough going on in the music.  Now I'm the type who likes to LISTEN to music.  Dogs quickly turns into background music and I must change the track.  Pigs is great.  It's the best on the whole album.  Cool sound effects, lyrics, riffs, and whatever else.  Sheep is alright, but I wouldn't ever put it on a compilation album.  Even though I rate this 4 stars, I say it's only okay.
0385043805|5.0|As a femminist I should object to the way this book portrays womyn, but this book is just so darn good, who cares about the other stuff.<br /><br />Ever since I first read this book when I was around 9 or 10 years old, Rebecca has haunted me.  Is she angel or devil, victim or vllian?<br /><br />Here's an interesting spectulation.  Perhaps she was a Lesbian forced into marriage with a man.  The book certainly makes it clear that Mrs. Danvers was in love with Rebecca.  And when Maxim is telling the second Mrs. DeWinter his version of what Rebecca was like, he even says that Rebecca wasn't normal.  And given the time this book was written, homophobia was completely acceptable, perhaps even, coupled with male pride, a justification for murder.<br /><br />The best thing about this book is the way Manderly is another character in the book.  The presence and energy of Manderly are  just as crucial as the humans in the story.<br /><br />What an incredible job Daphne DuMaurier does in creating her claustrophobic little world.  A world, which in spite of everything is full of glamour and romance.<br /><br />How I long to have tea under the chestnut tree at Manderly on a perfect summer's afternoon!  I think I'll wear my new summer frock with the flowers and that wide floppy hat...I wonder if Frifth will serve.<br /><br />And, of course, Rebecca is simply the most perfect hostess...Aren't the DeWinter's the perfect couple?<br /><br />What lies beneath the surface of Manderly?  Read Rebecca and find out.
B000006TRV|5.0|1) In The Flesh?: great way to begin an album.  It's loud, unexpected, and sets the tone for the rest of the story <br />2) The Thin Ice: has a very doowop feel to it...almost.  Leads to things to come. <br />3) Another Brick In The Wall (Part I): the first time what I consider to be \\"the theme\\" is stated.  Very similar lyrics to The Thin Ice. <br />4) The Happiest Days Of Our Lives: my personal favorite song from The Wall.  I like the way how it sounds like one long run-on sentence.  The transition to Another Brick In The Wall (Part II) has got to be one of the greatest things of all time! <br />5) Another Brick In The Wall (Part II): everybody knows this song... <br />6) Mother: fun to sing with.  Guitar solo reminds me of a Ford commercial <br />7) Goodbye Blue Sky: if anyone has seen the movie, this seen is the best.  Sorry to say, it's not as impressive on the album, but still good song.  The synth at the beginning sends chills down my spine. <br />8) Empty Spaces: great transitional song. <br />9) Young Lust: it took me a little while to like this one, but it eventually grew on me.  It's one of the few Floydian \\"rock 'n' roll\\" songs.  Now it's one of my favorites though. <br />10-12) One Of My Turns/Don't Leave Me Now/Another Brick In The Wall (Part III): I group these three all together because to me, they're all the same thing.  Not that impressive.  I usually tend to skip these when listening. <br />Goodbye Cruel World: <br />14) Hey You: this song gets way too much radio play.  I also don't think it's the best way to begin the second half of the story, but who am I to say? <br />15) Is There Anybody Out There?: very mysterious and cool.  The instrumentation at the end is really good.  Great atmosphere.  In my opinion, I think this should have started out the second half.  The words, \\"is there anybody out there,\\" sets the mood for all to come. <br />16) Nobody Home: I never use the word \\"beautiful\\" to describe a song, but that is what this song is. <br />17) Vera: pointless... <br />18) Bring The Boys Back Home: this song is also pointless, but it is so cool!  It's definitely one of my favorites on the album. <br />19) Comfortably Numb: everybody knows this one... <br />20) The Show Must Go On: brings the audience back to the beginning with similar melodies. <br />21) In The Flesh: brings the audience even more to the beginning...duh!  It has the same name and almost the same lyrics.  I like it better though.  The main character, Pink, becomes a fascist dictator here.  Weird. <br />22) Run Like Hell: if you think this is good, you should hear the version from The Wall Live (Is There Anybody Out There?). <br />23) Waiting For The Worms: more dictator stuff. <br />24) Stop: Waiting For The Worms crescendos up and up and out of nowhere Pink yells, \\"Stop!\\"  A new song begins and it is a great effect.  And now, the grand finale: <br />25) The Trial: don not be fooled, you are listening to rock music still, but you can't tell.  All of the previous charaters (the teacher, the mother, the girlfriend/wife figure) come back for the final trial.  The entire thing is orchestrated until the end when the \\"theme\\" is stated in the electric guitar.  Brilliant!  Absolutely BRILLANT!!! <br />26) Outside The Wall: the wall crumbles down and this business happens.  The melody from the very beginning is stated again and a loop is created.
B000002J1M|5.0|Foxtrot is probably the bands peak. <br />Gabriel is magnificent from beginning to end while Collins and co. built the best prog soundtrack. <br />From opener \\"Watcher of the Skies\\" till the last notes of 22 minutes long \\"Supper's Ready\\" tha band delivers a brilliant collaboration of poetry and jazz-rock. <br />If you're into 70's rock music go and buy this album today!
B000002C1W|2.0|This is the worst Pink Floyd album.  Learning To Fly is good, Sorrow is okay, One Slip and Yet Another Movie/Round And Around are tolerable, On The Turning Away is lame, Signs Of Life and The Dogs Of War are totally pointless, and I won't even say anything about A Lame Machine (Part I) and An Even More Lame Machine (Part II)...too late.  If you are a diehard fan, you know that you have to get this eventually, but don't waste your money if you're a casual listener.  It's not even good for 80s music - that says a alot.  Usually I try to write about the good things in albums, but it's near impossible to do with this.  AMLOR should have been calle A Complete Lapse Of Coolness...yeah - take that.  I don't know, maybe I'm a little hard on David Gilmour and gang here - no...nope.  If you're wanting some later Floyd, then The Division Bell is what you want.  AMLOR is kind of an un-good version of TDB.
0060763280|2.0|If you have read a few of the \\"personal finance\\" books that are currently available you will quickly realize that this book is just like all the others. There is very little new substance, just a new parable to tell the same story. If you have read Rich Dad Poor Dad and Millionaire Mind, then there is no need to read this book. If you, as a hobby, like reading these type of books then you will prob enjoy this one. It isn't a bad read, just not terribly eye opening. One gets the sense that the book is just an extended marketing piece for the authors seminars (indeed the 3 pages at the end on various \\"backend\\" products offered by the author just goes to bolster this argument). Perhaps the one interesting \\"new idea\\" introduced by this book is a catch-22. See, according to this book, in order to become rich you need to be open to new ideas like this book as well as attend seminars (by experts) etc etc. In other words if you criticize this book, you are just not rich or enlightened. pity.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|I don't know why I made that my title...whatever.  People give The Final Cut a hard time.  They claim that it's not really Pink Floyd, but a Roger Waters solo album.  Who cares?!  This is really good, and definitely one of my favorites.  As a precaution though, you can't listen to the songs seperately (except for maybe Not Now John and When The Tigers Broke Free).  The album really acts as one long song that must be taken together.  The addition of When The Tigers was a good decision.  It's just plain cool - completely orchestrated with chorus and the like.  Also, I'm not big on profanity.  I really don't like it much at all.  But Not Now John has to be my favorite on the album, and one of my favorite Pink Floyd songs (it uses the...\\"f word\\"...quite a bit).  Anyways, ignore the complaints of the bitter PF fans who say don't get it becasue it's not really Pink Floyd.
B0007GADZO|2.0|Well, I bought this on its UK release date, so you will know I am a fan ... but this really is a great example of the kings new clothes.  <br /> <br />However much you wrap up the package with pretentious meanderings, the listener will judge the success or failure of this album on the music alone. Sure, in may cases it is interesting to know a little about the history of a song, and the emotions of the artist at the time they wrote it, but it is not interesting in the least to have it wrapped up in some stupid pretentious ramble that has no meaning or relevance whatsoever. But hey, if the music is great who gives a damn ? <br /> <br />As a great example, Steve could wrap Alien Love Secrets in a copy of the Fortean Times or National Enquirer and it would still be superb. What about this one then ? <br /> <br />I love(d) Steve Vai because in an album of 10 songs, there will always be 1,2 or 3 that move your own musical boundaries and appreciations a little further... push the boundaries a bit. Sometimes he steps too far, but that is the nature of genius and in relation to the 'whole' the experimentation is kept to an acceptible level, as the other 7 or so tracks are pure delight. <br /> <br />On this album the ratio is reversed, and why do I feel his pain ?   Because Steve had two choices; stay where he was musically ( and write better examples of that genre ), or move on and find a completely different niche .... and here he has effectively done neither. What he has done here is repeat the same tracks he has put out before but make it even more wacky .. horrible guitar sounds, lots of alien type noises and screeches .... yes, all very wierd and wonderful, but not in the least bit musical... but the \\"underlying\\" music has not changed in any way.  <br /> <br />I can imagine the conversation now ... Steve: \\"we need to move on, and I have been experienting with this great new sound, a little like a cat being neutered\\" ... Billy: OK, Boss ... sounds different anyway !\\" ..Steve: \\"Yes, and I even have this one that sounds like a kid gargling\\" ... Billy \\"Wow, that's real progress!\\"  <br /> <br />I would love to say things differently, because I am well aware that you only get good review ratings if you say nice things, rather than helpful things, but if you love music rather than sound effects; flow rather than sound bytes; emotion rather than exhibitionism, structure rather than chaos, then I would shy away from this album until you have at least heard it all. I wish I had. <br /> <br />This album is just beginning to show signs that Steve Vai might not be the musical genius we thought him to be .. he certainly is a guitar genius, but give me a musical genius any day. <br /> <br />And surely the best example of why I feel Steve has basically stood still? I think this is either the third or fourth were we have the typical \\"Shut up, we know you can play\\" type comment. Yes, Steve, but that is NOT why we buy your records ... we buy your records because you have, in the past, made GREAT MUSIC
B00006CXXU|5.0|I bought \\"Stripped\\" back in 2003. It is now 2005 and I still rate \\"Stripped\\" as one of my favorite, and one of the best albums I own. This is the one CD you can put in and listen to all 20 songs right through. Christina's voice is simply amazing. She definitley distanced herself from other \\"pop stars\\" such as britney and other less talented performers. I whole heartidly reccommend this album, i promise you wont be dissapointed!
B00008PX8P|5.0|what can I say?  This is an absolute masterpiece!  It's like I've died and gone to heaven!
B00005JLEX|5.0|Seinfeld was such a masterpiece of sitcom television that even 10+ years later the first two seasons are absolutely priceless entertainment. The key to the genius of this show, I've always thought, is that there are no serious episodes - nothing but comedy from start to finish. So many other sitcoms became unbearable or just crashed and burned because for some crazy reason they decided to develop some kind of serious theme that served as a distraction away from the comedy element. Seinfeld never even came close to doing this and will live on forever as one of the greatest sitcoms ever because of it.
B00000JBCP|5.0|I think that this album is one the greatest that this band has ever made in their entire history. The music for Mana has stayed the same for some time and one of their big themes is about love. A song that I love is \\" Cuando los angeles lloran\\", which tells the story about a guy who loved the jungle and died trying to protect it. This rock band is known for their songs against illegal cutting of trees and saving the rain forest in Mexico. Another one of my favorite songs is \\"Mariposa Traicionera\\" and this song is about a girl and how her love was unworthy of any man because she is like a butterfly. This girls is very unstable and likes to break the guy's heart's but she does not care. One of the trademarks from this group is the slow rock. Unlike any other Spanish rock band that I have heard, Mana makes the words come into your most inner self. Through their words, Mana makes you remember of those whom have betrayed, loved, and those who have deserted you. Their lyrics tend to stay the same because in every album they sing about the some of the same stuff. They mostly sing about judicial injustice in Mexico, little boys and girls working in the streets, and people whom have leaved their loved ones. I am attracted to this group because they speak my language and because they make me remember of my country. They help me to realize all of the problems that are going on in Mexico and how they try to express it through music. I would recommend this cd to all of those whose hearts have been broken by girls or whom just like good Spanish rock. If you like guitar doodles and crazy drum solos, check this band out!!! Another group that has Mana's style are the Jaguares because they have similar lyrics and style. Another cd that I love from Mana is their latest album \\"Revolucion de amor\\". If you like Spanish rock, then you won't have any problems listening to Mana. Viva Mexico!!!
B0002T7ZKW|4.0|Green Day has really been away from the industry for such a very long time. Yet, they really came back very well in a vengence. Their comeback track, AMerican Idiot really brings their fell back to the mainstream, especially after their lackluster album Warning. The song here is a very well charged and fierce rock anthem for anti-Bush fans who are just tired of hearing him not care about youth. It is juat a fusion of hard-driving punk that hasn't been in our lives inquite a longtime. It is juat a great pop song, and a must listen to for Green Day fans. I actually enjoy this hard core song.<br /><br />Song: B+
B0002XH9Z4|5.0|Here is a four-disc retrospective \\"kingspan\\". This collection covers the all-time career of the King Of Pop aka Michael Jackson. His Jackson 5 recordings,his Jacksons recordings and his solo recordings. What more could a Michael Jackson fan ask for,right? There are also some new songs,and some previously released hits that never made it to 1995's HISTORY and 2003's NUMBER ONES. There's also either a new or previously unreleased version of WE ARE THE WORLD. The original 1985 version that many of us know was written by Jackson and ex-Commodore Lionel Richie. The original version was recorded by an all-star ensemble called USA For Africa. In addition to Jackson and Richie,a handful of participating artists included Stevie Wonder,Diana Ross,Bruce Springsteen,Billy Joel,Bob Dylan,Cyndi Lauper and Paul Simon. This collection's version features only,of course,Jackson's vocals. This collection is a must for every MJ fan. This is 35 years of MJ's career(1970-2004). He outsold the Beatles and the late great Elvis Presley. I'm sure Beatles and Elvis fans are MJ fans as well.
B00005JNPZ|4.0|Alex \\"Hitch\\" Hitchens (Smith) is the date doctor.  Having problems getting the girl you want?  Call Hitch.  He will show you just what you need to do to win her over, and tell you what mistakes to avoid.  He knows all this from observation.  He has seen what works, and wants to share his knowledge.  On the down side, his own love life is sorely lacking.  Enter Sara, a gossip writer who catches Hitch's eye.  They go on a series of disasterous dates in which Hitch can do nothing right, but somehow a connection is made.  Of course, Sara is following a lead on the mythical date doctor, and you know that sooner or later, Hitch's secret will be revealed.<br /><br />Will Smith does a good job in his first romantic comedy, showing the screen presence that movie-goers have come to expect.  Kevin James steals almost every scene that he is in as the unlucky in love Albert.  They are the reasons that this movie works, and is very funny at times.  The story itself is predictable (as most romantic comedies are), but weaves a number of stories into an ending where everything comes together.  \\"Hitch\\" is a good date movie, and a funnier than average film.
B0006GAOBI|3.0|For starters, I assume if you're looking into reviews for this directors cut, you've seen the movie proper before.  I don't feel the need to rehash what many other people have already said about the movie.  So if you want a more critical assesment of the film, I encourage you to check out some of those other reviews.  But if you haven't seen the movie before, in a nutshell, just know that it involves a fallen airplane engine, time travel, a creepy bunny named Frank and Patrick Swayze(who may in fact be scarier than the freakshow bunny costume on display).  The movie plays like David Lynch-lite, but unlike Lynch, this actually makes a little sense without racking your brain too hard(I can almost hear Lynch's fans curseing at me now).  The purpose of this cut, as Mr. Kelly says himself, is to try and make the movie closer to what he wanted it to be in theaters.<br /><br />Does it work?  It's longer, that's for sure, but your enjoyment of this cut depends on what you think of the movie.  If you're like the poor s.o.b. who shows up in one of the special features on the disc( more on him later ), than this could could very well help you achieve nirvana(the state of mind, not the band, for you kids out there).  Aside from some of the deleted scenes found on the first dvd release being reinserted into the film, we have some new stuff not seen before.  An additional scene with grandma Death, lengthly looks inside the book and close ups of Donnie's eye, which are very annoyingly the brightest shots in the movie, are included.  I personally don't think the additional scenes added much to the overall picture, if anything, they seem to me to be padding out the running time.<br /><br />The main selling point of this dvd, no doubt, is the commentary with Mr. Kelly and Kevin Smith.  This is a fun track, with Mr. Smith cracking jokes and busting Kelly's chops over the more pretentious qualities of the the movie.  Also included are a production diary(listen to it with the commentary or you'll be bored to tears), \\"They Made Me Do It Too\\" featurette(fans, mainly ones fron the U.K., sound off), a storyboard-to-screen featurette and the director's cut trailer.  And then, the sad-sack I mentioned earlier has his own featurette, \\"#1 Fan: A Darkomentary\\" .  This guy has his room plastered with Darko stuff, dresses like Donnie and even stalks James Duval.  He also catches up to Mr. Kelly at the comic-con(a comics related convention, for those who don't know) and confronts him with the worst thing that an obsessed fan can do.<br /><br />So, bottom line, is this dvd worth owning?  People looking to this version for additional insights into the movie might be let down.  If you buy into the whole \\" Cult of Donnie \\" thing that kids at Hot Topic stores around the country slop up like so much goth-tinged gruel, then this may be your bag of meat.  The commentary did it for me, but you just might want to stick with the first edition.be bored to tears), \\"They Made Me Do It Too\\" featurette(fans, mainly ones fron the U.K., sound off), a storyboard-to-screen featurette and the director's cut trailer.

B0000AUHPG|5.0|If you like movies put \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" on your list. <br />If you are a Henry Fonda or Charles Bronson or Jason Robart's fan move it to the top of your list. <br />If you are a fan of Westerns, long epics, and cinematography get this movie right now, cancel your appointments and let yourself be drawn in by a western that is at or near the top of the \\"best westerns ever\\" list. <br />Enjoy!!
B0000TLA9G|5.0|\\"Greatest Hits\\" from Guns 'N' Roses is one of the compilation albums around. The first few songs, Welcome to the Jungle, Sweet Child, Paradise City, extracted from the radical Appetite for Destruction album of 1987, give listeners a dose of the heavy metal unique sound of the band in their early stages.  Although GNR's later albums didn't quite make as much of a bang as Appetite for Destruction, they showed that the band still had great musical talents as well a great appreciation of the original revolutionary bands.  The covers of the Stones in Symapthy for the Devil, The Beatles in Live and Let Die, and Bob Dylan in Knockin' on Heaven's Door, all of which are on this \\"Greatest Hits\\" album, show the great musical taste and knowledge of this great band.

0684859106|1.0|I have been baking for about 20 years.  I visited New York and fell in love with the Magnolia Bakery. Last year, I bought this book.  Since then I have tried several recipes, including cheesecakes, layer cakes, brownies, squares and cookies.  I'd say about 80% of the recipes don't come out right ...and I don't mean they are bland or slightly off; they consistently turn out just awful: underbaked brownies, cookies that fall apart, sickenly sweet icing, flat layer cakes, dry cheese cakes.  Maybe it's the difference between the ingredients they use at the bakery vs. those you can get in the supermarket or the difference between baking in a home oven vs. a commercial oven, but the ONLY time the recipes came out right is when I made a common-sense judgement and strayed from the book's suggestions -- baking longer than suggested times or adding more or fewer ingredients, etc. <br /> <br />My favorite cookbook continues to be the Cook's Illustrated/ America's Test Kitchen \\"Best Recipes\\" book. <br /> <br />Even so, next time I'm in New York, I'm headed to the Magnolia Bakery again.  It's great!
B000000OE7|4.0|... and most of all not really a fan of Queen's and am much less familiar with their history, but it doesn't shut me off from heaping a lot a good things on this cd.  Since having just discovered that it was recorded (or re-recorded) after Freddie Mercury passed away, I can't help but sometimes feel a bit haunted and sometimes a bit wistful.  \\"Let Me Live\\" I think sums it all up, with Mercury singing with all his passion, as if really beseeching to the heavens above to give him another chance (great choir intro there).  That's only one of the highlights of this cd that also includes the title track, \\"It's A Beautiful Day\\", \\"My Life Has Been Saved\\", and (the very popular, at least in my opinion) \\"Too Much Love Will Kill You\\" (with Brian May on vocals), the dance-beckoning \\"You Don't Fool Me\\", and \\"A Winter's Tale\\" which I feel is one of the greatest stuff Queen together had ever written.  <br /> <br />With its mostly upbeat moments, this is almost totally a rose-colored opus, and some may say, \\"oh, it's so  'right on' \\" so on and so forth.  But for those who may want to find another lease on life, this cd will probably make a good starting point.  And I think that demonstrates the greatest legacy Freddie Mercury had left... sharing a lot of great music and good life-affirming songs not only to every Mercury devotee but to other music fans as well (aside from their famed dramatic, stadium-filling bombast).  And it proves one important thing--his spirit still moves and will definitely move on through his music. <br />
0312330529|5.0|Shantaram is a sprawling, exotic read teeming with life, heart and hope.  Mr. Roberts brings his own experiences to light in this wonderful novel that shows his readers what life is really about and what is really important. <br /> <br />I have not read a book like this before in my entire life.  It is a novel that has the feel of a travelogue and the tone of an autobiography and it will pull you in and not let you go until you have read the last word.  Shantaram is marvelous and even though it is in excess of 900 pages, you will reach the end of it wishing that you could still go on. <br /> <br />If you like India, Bombay, travel, personal trials and tribulations or just one cracking good story then Shantaram is a must read.
B00018D3RI|5.0|Great cop show, amazing car chase and good fight scenes. Loaded with humor and 70's pop culture. I will not repeat the good things people have already pointed out. <br /> <br />Don't compare it with the Ben Stiller (who is a fine actor and actually imitated Starsky's walk really well) and Owen Wilson movie Starsky and Hutch - the movie does not do justice to the show. Yes, we all know that the movie is more of a spoof but still the characters can't portray what Paul Michael Glaser and David Soul brought to this hit show. The stories have a lot of substance into them and it not just some show with fast car, shooting people etc. - there are several dialogues/lines/scenes that force us to think of various painful issues that are present in the society - especially in the later seasons. <br /> <br />You will not regret buying it. It is a must have for any fan of good cop shows with sensitive characters that are passionate about their work. The show is pure fun. <br /> <br />
0156012197|5.0|I am not sure how I can best explain this book, and how I can exprime the emotions it causes in me. I read it first a number of years ago in French, and ever since then it was been my staple gift for people - anyone who does not have a copy of The Little Prince, I promptly spend the nine dollars it costs me so that more people can understand its beauty. Its like I have a circle of effect around me in which everyone has read The Little Prince because of my influence.<br /><br />I cannot praise it enough. It is a children's story with layers, and adults can enjoy the more philosophical portions of it. For a children's book, it is sad. I have read it out loud a number of times and I always choke up at the end, as well as my listener. The story is touching and memorable, melancholy but optimistic. And every time after you read it (especially if it is with your child), you can go out at night and look up at the stars and ask, \\"Has the sheep eaten the flower?\\" And you will see how this book can make everything change!<br /><br />I cannot suplicate you enough to permit yourself the pleasure of reading this story!
B00003CXCT|1.0|I grew up with these absolute classic movies. I have been waiting since I bought my dvd player years ago for the release of these onto dvd. I am a star wars purist. Though the original versions may not have had the super realistic special effects, they had something that the new ones are lacking entirely.....SOUL!!!! I remember when I was young cracking a tear at the end of Jedi as all of the Ewoks and Charactors danced around........I can still hear that SONG!!!! To my horror, when Jedi ended, this version was a dry as toast. No heart at all. What a stupid thing to do to the end of a one of a kind trilogy. And how stupid to put young Anikan in there instead of the old Anikan that we were used to. And then to keep Obi One as an old man.......it just makes no freakin' sense. STUPID. Just to push his rewrite of the story..........and George, if you happen to read this, I really hope your third Star Wars coming out in May of this year is a hell of a lot better than the other two new ones, as they just do not have it. I will give you a hint, try a little less special effects, and a whole lot more story and charactor development. The first three Star Wars were all great movies that tied in perfectly with the previous films. The new ending of Jedi tore that continuity to pieces. They are only cheapening the entire Star Wars franchise by doing these stupid changes. It seems that Lucas is loosing touch with what made Star Wars such a great movie to begin with.
B0006213WG|2.0|I find it hilarious that people suggested that the editorial reviewer should be fired for presenting an opinion that was disagreed with. Opinions, people.<br /><br />This Sum 41 album is mediocre at best, no matter how much more seriously they take themselves, their music is still paper thin. There is nothing original about their \\"new\\" sound. I wish that if bands were going to reinvent themselves, they would actually invent.<br /><br />Edit: I'd also like to note Sum 41's shameless rip-off of the riff from 'The Scientist' by Coldplay, on their song 'Pieces'.
B0006399FS|1.0|If the lyrics and feel of the album don't thoroughly depress you, its ploddingly slow pace and lack of any spark whatsoever will bore you to tears. Absolutely nothing here rises to its only half-arsed pseudo-melodicism and -accessability. <br /> <br />Every little Edge guitar snippet is so obviously studied, canned and played by rote, so seemingly devoid of any feeling, it's painful. If you want to hear the sound of a once-great band growing old right before your ears, and accepting it, this is the dull disc for you. Expect the old dated jangle-pop tunesmiths of ATYCLB to return with this album. Spare, empty, trite. <br /> <br />Like an overhyped bad action movie as Matrix, U2 2000 are all machines and no relevancy at all. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Not my favorite, but definitely a classic. The story line is cute and the quality is much better. Of course the movie is about a million years old (well maybe not that old), so some things may seem a little out of date. However, I've watched it a few times and have never gotten bored of it. I don't have any children, but I did watch it with my goddaughter (who is 3), and she loved it! She did get a bit scared on the part the witch is running and it's raining, but apparently not enough, since she then wanted to see the movie again. I think overall the movie is great, both the story and the DVD version. It is a real shame that is not available to purchase anymore.
0385510454|1.0|In the author's note Grisham admits he knows nothing about satellites or high tech. Now it seems he also lost his storytelling ability.  <br /> <br />I kept on reading the endless menus of Bologna's restaurants and the Italian-English translations of the flat, boring dialogue hoping the story will somehow develop, but was mightily disappointed. The characters are of the cardboard variety with no substance whatsoever and the storyline barely holding by a thread with nothing really happening till the very end. <br /> <br />Is this really the same author who gave us \\"The Firm\\" and \\"The Pelican Brief\\"? Obviously, Grisham's name sells books and these days he gets contracts to publish just any nonsense he chooses. As readers, we can only vote with our $$$ - don't waste your money or time. <br />

0375507256|4.0|Quite an amazing read - very daring!   It's like a set of Russian dolls with one story nestling inside another story nestling inside ... . In all there are six novellas of equal length - covering a whole range of genres and text types - history, comedy, thriller and science-fiction ... journal, letters, memoir, best-seller, interview and oral history.   In a playful twist the protagonist of each story becomes the consumer of the story that has gone before. Our need for stories is part of our humanity, he seems to say - and always will be. Less savoury aspects of our humanity are explored through the stories - greed and consumerism, prejudice, exploitation and enslavement. <br /> <br />I must confess to having enjoyed The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish most.  I don't often laugh out loud when I read, but this was deliciously, wickedly funny. Loved it where a disgruntled author encounters a critic who has written a particularly negative review, pitches him over the balcony. (Makes you wonder if there is an element of wishful thinking on Mitchell's part here!)  <br /> <br />But ultimately It's Mitchell's skill with language that excites most - how does the guy manage to juggle so many styles, so many distinctive voices? In the final story Shoosha's Crossing and Everything After he creates a completely new post-apocolyptic dialect of English which is both plausible and poetic. In Half Lives - The First Luisa Rey Mystery he manages to write a thriller which conforms to all the characteristics of the genre (one which I generally hate)- but which is actually a great deal better written than many of the thrillers that make the best-seller list. He makes it look so effortless too. And I found myself underlining some of Timothy Cavendish's hilarious pronouncements because they delighted me so much.  Can't resist slipping in a couple of my favourite lines here: <br /> <br /> A trio of teenettes, dressed like Prostitute Barbie, approached, driftnetting the width of the pavement. <br /> <br />Sometimes the fluffy bunny of incredulity zooms around the bend so rapidly that the greyhound of language is left, agog, in the starting cage. <br /> <br />The only moan that I have about the book is that the Sceptre paperback version had print so small that it had me reaching for my reading glasses, and one of the least inspiring cover designs I've seen on a paperback in yonks. <br />
0765309408|5.0|I've been reading science fiction since the early 1950s and while I am no real fan of \\"military Sci Fi\\", I can say without reservation this is one of the best reads I've had in years.  Since the main character is a rejuvenated 75 years old, I may be biased, but I found this novel really has it all: exciting action, a fresh sense of wonder, great love story, infectious humor, and a really original premise, all set in a startling, scary far future.  Well written and very entertaining--can't wait for Scalzi's next book--maybe a sequel? The man can write!
B00003CX8Y|5.0|This is my favorite movie of my whole Disney collection! I absolutely LOVE this movie...always has. The colors on the DVD are fantastic and the story line is the best! The new song \\"Human Again\\" is very cute and catchy! One weird thing I did notice is that when the Closed Caption is on, it will say some things that the characters will not. (Ex. Belle's father asks her if she had a good time in town). I found that a little odd. I checked another DVD to see if there was something wrong with mine, but it was just the same. I'm now wondering whether the old VHS version does the same. Not that I really mind that, I'm just curious, since I'm so in love with this movie! Wonderful classic, never get bored of watching it!

B000002L7R|5.0|Now, I know I'm not the only one that realizes that critics barely know what the hell their talking about. I must admit that the first time I heard this album I was not that thrilled by it. But the more I heard it, it quickly became one of my favorites. I think this album is very underated and quite brilliant. I believe that this album allowed Prince to develope as an artist in a big way.
B0002X314C|5.0|This album, in my opinion, is essential listening for anyone who loves music... period.  It is a breath of fresh air to hear his music in this day of sampling, mixing and all overprocessed beeps, blips and assorted noises.  I have it on hand at all times since I purchased it a few weeks ago and I listen to it constantly.  Mind you, I listen to all types of music including R+B, hip-hop, rap, classic rock, soul, funk, metal, traditional jazz, neo-jazz, neo-soul, etc;  and this album is just phenomenal!  I hope John Legend continues to do in the future what he did on this album.  Just fantastic!  Keep it coming John. <br />I highly recommend this album. <br />
0062511408|5.0|Unos encuentran este libro aburrido, sencillo, sin mucho que decir.  Con ellos no puedo discutir.  Otros dicen que este libro es uno de los mas importante en las ultimas dos dcadas.  A la vez, con ellos estoy de acuerdo.  Para mi, esta historia es mas que el sumen de las palabras, los prrafos, las paginas.  No es una novela de Tom Clancy.  Es una fbula y las fbulas nos ofrecen algo diferente.  Es un retrato de un corazn joven luchando con los desafos de la vida real.  Cmo navegar las corrientes del ro de la vida y seguir sus sueos, sus ambiciones?  Si pensamos que hemos contestado ya todas las preguntas importantes que hay, vamos a aburrirnos con este libro.  Por otro lado, para nosotros que seguimos buscando nuestra verdadera manera de ser, Coelho tiene algo importante que decirnos.
0792841344|5.0|This is a movie at it`s best.When I watched it 1st time, I adored it, cause Don Coscarelli had created a suspense, dark PhantasMy. The characters are as well selected as the locations. There is a lot crap in the genre, but fortunately this is one of the greatest movies the 70`s gave us. You'll hiding behind your couch when stell balls flying towards you, but first you have to rent or buy this movie , if you're fan of great, good entertaining Horrorthriller!!
B0000025F7|5.0|This was his breakthrough, the album that established him as an artist of astonishing talent and a bright star in his own right. This was a visionary album, a record that found a way to break disco wide open into a new world where the beat was undeniable, but not the primary focus -- it was part of a colorful tapestry of lush ballads and strings, smooth soul and pop, soft rock and alluring funk. Its roots hearken back to the Jacksons' huge mid-'70s hit \\"Dancing Machine,\\" but this is an enormously fresh record, one that remains vibrant and giddily exciting years after its release. This is certainly due to Jackson's emergence as a blindingly gifted vocalist, equally skilled with overwrought ballads as \\"She's Out of My Life\\" as driving dancefloor shakers as \\"Working Day and Night\\" and \\"Get on the Floor,\\" where his asides are as gripping as his delivery on the verses. It's also due to the brilliant songwriting, an intoxicating blend of strong melodies, rhythmic hooks, and indelible construction. Most of all, its success is due to the sound constructed by Jackson and producer Quincy Jones, a dazzling array of disco beats, funk guitars, clean mainstream pop, and unashamed schmaltz that is utterly thrilling in its utter joy. This is highly professional, highly crafted music, and its details are evident, but the overall effect is nothing but pure pleasure.
0060763280|1.0|Eker's book is really nothing new or different - \\"strategies\\" for getting rich, \\"blueprints\\" for business, and \\"the power of positive thinking\\" and how it works/doesn't work that have been covered over and over by other writers, proving that the \\"secret\\" to getting rich is to take the same ideas and reword them so that they have a fresh sound. If thinking about being rich made it so, we'd all live next door to Donald Trump. Start your path to making my money by saving the dollars you'd spend on this book. I had to struggle through it in order to review it, because I felt I had read the same thing umpteen times before (I have) and heard it over and over again in seminars(I have). Nothing new or different. Ask people around the world who work themselves to death but still didn't get rich. We should write books about it instead. I do highly recommend \\"The Money Book for the Young, Fabulous and Broke\\" by Suze Orman. It's an excellent book with sound advice.
B000002UJQ|5.0|having not listened to popular music for the second half on the 90s, I missed on this. Thanks to US Airways onflight entertainment (!!!) \\"No surprises\\" hooked into my ear indelibly. Now its \\"Let Down\\" and Karma Police--these are just great melodies---and after listening to the album many times, one even starts to like \\"fitter happier\\"
B00008BXJG|5.0|This is a great album, it is definitive AC/DC, no tracks should be left unhired especially \\"Highway to Hell\\", of course... but there are other's \\"Get It Hot\\", \\"Shot Down In Flames\\", \\"If You Want Blood (You Got It)\\" and with the last \\"recorded\\" voice of Bon Scott \\"Night Prowler\\" to end off the album. Another one people should not be without regardless even if your an AC/DC fan.
B000002UAX|5.0|Each song on the double album The Beatles is an entity to itself, as the band touches on anything and everything it can. This makes for a frustratingly scattershot record or a singularly gripping musical experience, depending on your view, but what makes the so-called White Album interesting is its mess. Never before had a rock record been so self-reflective, or so ironic; the Beach Boys send-up \\"Back in the U.S.S.R.\\" and the British blooze parody \\"Yer Blues\\" are delivered straight-faced, so it's never clear if these are affectionate tributes or wicked satires. Lennon turns in two of his best ballads with \\"Dear Prudence\\" and \\"Julia\\"; scours the Abbey Road vaults for the musique concrte collage \\"Revolution 9\\"; pours on the schmaltz for Ringo's closing number, \\"Good Night\\"; celebrates the Beatles cult with \\"Glass Onion\\"; and, with \\"Cry Baby Cry,\\" rivals Syd Barrett. McCartney doesn't reach quite as far, yet his songs are stunning -- the music hall romp \\"Honey Pie,\\" the mock country of \\"Rocky Raccoon,\\" the ska-inflected \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da,\\" and the proto-metal roar of \\"Helter Skelter.\\" Clearly, the Beatles' two main songwriting forces were no longer on the same page, but neither were George and Ringo. Harrison still had just two songs per LP, but it's clear from \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps,\\" the canned soul of \\"Savoy Truffle,\\" the haunting \\"Long, Long, Long,\\" and even the silly \\"Piggies\\" that he had developed into a songwriter who deserved wider exposure. And Ringo turns in a delight with his first original, the lumbering country-carnival stomp \\"Don't Pass Me By.\\" None of it sounds like it was meant to share album space together, but somehow The Beatles creates its own style and sound through its mess.
B00003CX5P|1.0|Considering the money, cast, and producers behind it, the Phantom Menace is possibly the worst movie ever made.  Even the title is confusing.  It's almost like they just chose a title that sounded cool and threw it on.  It doesn't mean anything.  What exactly is the phantom menace?  Who is the phantom menace?  Is it Darth Maul, a character we see for about five minutes before he's killed?  Come on.  How terrible.  How cheap.  Do they really think we're that stupid?  And don't get me started with the acting.  Even though some very good actors are in this movie, they all do a horrible job.  It's almost like they did the movie for the sake of doing it.  There was no emotion.  Look at Natalie Portman.  NOt a flicker of interest, and she sounds like a lesbian.  Liam Neeson?  He acts sort of gay, and seems out of place.  And the kid is the worst.  I wish he would have died (the kid, not the character) in the making of the movie.  Have you noticed that he hasn't been in anything since?  Hmmmm, I wonder why.  He absolutely ruined the movie.  People blame Jar Jar, but it was Jake Lloyd who ruined it.  Of course, having a terrible script didn't help either.  Remember that part where he says \\"Yippee?\\"  Who the heck actually says yippee?  No one.  How terrible.  I can't believe this movie actually made it to theaters.  The minor characters are stupid too.  The salesman who talks like a greasy Italian, the viceroys, they're just annoying.  And I hate all the senate crap.  It's boring.  If I wanted to watch the senate crap, I'd turn on C-Span.  I could go on for days.  The first three Star Wars movies are great, but this one isn't worthy of them.  What a tragedy.  Oh, and Attack of the Clones is almost as bad as this one, certainly slower and as badly acted.  Stay away from them!  Use the force if you have to...

B000002H6C|4.0|...And Justice For All, mettalica is good on this album but of course metallica doesn't really change from the past few albums they have but hey this album is good, It's got \\"One\\" not a gold or platinum, but diamond song one of my favorites, the other songs sort of explain themselves \\"Blackened\\" is good, \\"The Shortest Straw\\" is up there too and the title track is a good one too. I would recommend this album but by it if you like or buy the previous albums before you by this if you like so you get a sense of the change of metallica's songs and of course hear the two differant bassists Cliff Burton pasted away after \\"Master\\", rest in peace man and was replaced by Jason Newsted, who has been with Metallica up till now almost he's not on St. Anger.
B00005AQE8|5.0|2Pac emerged hardened and hungry with All Eyez on Me, the first double-disc album of original material in hip-hop history. All Eyez on Me is 2Pac the thug icon in all his brazen excess, throwing off all self-control and letting it all hang out -- even if some of it would have been better kept to himself. In that sense, it's an accurate depiction of what made him such a volatile and compelling personality, despite some undeniable filler. On the plus side, this is easily the best production he's ever had on record. Despite some good moments, the second disc is slowed by filler and countless guest appearances, plus a few too many thug-lovin' divas crooning their loyalty. Erratic though it may be, All Eyez on Me is nonetheless carried off with the assurance of a legend in his own time, and it stands as 2Pac's magnum opus
0385504209|3.0|THE DA VINCI CODE is the 2nd book in a series of books surrounding the character of Robert Langdon. Langdon made his first appearance in ANGELS AND DEMONS and not only single-handedly saved the world, but helped &#34;reform&#34; the Catholic church as well. Superman might be able to fly and see through walls, the X-Men can do all sorts of superhuman feats because of their mutant genes, and Batman protects Gotham City because of the very technological (and expensive) gadgets at his disposal, but all these superheroes would be hard pressed to match the mastermind and wit of Harvard symbologist, Robert Langdon. In ANGELS AND DEMONS he saved the world in less than 24 hours. In THE DA VINCI CODE Langdon's on a quest even more important than saving the world.<br /><br />THE DA VINCI CODE begins about a year after the events of ANGELS AND DEMONS have taken place (don't be alarmed if you haven't read ANGELS AND DEMONS, references to the events of that book are few and far between). Robert Langdon is in his hotel room in Paris when he is disturbed by the arrival of Captain Bezu Fache. Langdon is informed that there has been a murder at the Louvre and that his expertise is needed in helping solve the crime. As it turns out, Fache strongly suspects Langdon of the crime and is hoping that Langdon's assistance will be his own undoing--ala the Columbo technique. Unfortunately for Fache, the murdered museum's curator has left a message behind for his granddaughter, Sophie Neveu, a code breaker on the Paris police force. The message leads Sophie to assist Langdon in his escape and thus begins another 24-hour adventure that takes Langdon across France and to England in search of one of the greatest historical and archeological discoveries of all time: the &#34;Holy Grail.&#34;<br /><br />Despite a series of murders and a mysterious albino priest, THE DA VINCI CODE actually moves fairly slowly in the beginning. The first half of the book tends to jump around a lot and includes a lot of exposition. It isn't until Langdon and Sophie leave the Lourve and head towards the Swiss bank that things begin to pick up. The book then moves at a modest pace until the duo meet up with Sir Leigh Teabing. Once he reveals the &#34;big secret&#34; the book becomes a page turner until the end.<br /><br />As far as writing styles go, THE DA VINCI CODE isn't all that great. It's a decent mystery/suspense novel and some of the imagery in the book is fairly descriptive, especially the more &#34;action&#34; oriented passages. However, THE DA VINCI CODE isn't written as well as ANGELS AND DEMONS. That book, though a piece of pop literia as well, was fairly tight with enough diversions to forgive the plot holes and discrepancies. THE DA VINCI CODE isn't like that. It's patterned after ANGELS AND DEMONS and like most sequels, it's just not as good.<br /><br />Now, as for the theme of the novel, I'm not sure why this book has taken off the way it has because overall it's just an average mystery/suspense novel. The book does present a very controversial idea-that Jesus wasn't the Son of God, that he married Mary Magdalene, they had children, and their descendants are still alive today. Combined with ideas presented in ANGELS AND DEMONS, it does seem that Brown as an agenda to debunk the Christin faith. He does an interesting job of mixing a tad historical facts; lots of fiction, conspiracy theories, and suppositions; and a whole lot of cultural references to make the idea seem not only plausible, but also believable. To make the theme seem even more believable he takes an idea from satiric and comic writers and introduces a statement at the beginning of the book that says something to the effect that &#34;all the organizations, histories, descriptions, etc. within this book are true and based on fact&#34;. The majority of the book has about as much fact in it as William Golding put in THE PRINCESS BRIDE.<br /><br />Overall, an average mystery/action/suspense novel with a very controversial proposal that makes for interesting fiction, but has no basis in fact.ery controversial proposal that makes for interesting fiction, but has no basis in fact.
B00001QGPR|2.0|There's a couple of good track on Hours (Thursday's child, Something in the air and Seven) but overall it lacks quality songs. The instrumentation is a bit too passive and sparse too for my taste. In theory that could've worked well, since the lyrics are quite depressive and the overall mood is a heavy one, but it all sounds bit uninspired to me. Add to that the lack of inventive songwriting and you have a very mediocre album.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver is absolutely brilliant you would never of expected some of this stuff in the 1960's. Why I say it is the greatest album ios because everyone supposed beest is Sgt. Pepper, well quite frankly if you think about it some of the stuff on this album was groundwork for Sgt. Pepper so that means without revolver there would be no Sgt. Pepper or if you think about the wider picture there would be no other differant type of music today...that is why it is so good. Give a listen to all the weird stuff the Fab Four put on this album you'll almost agree with me, \\"Taxman\\" to start off the album is a good start, \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" has backwards guitar, the first Indian music song \\"Love You To\\", \\"Here,There, and Everywhere\\" good melodic stuff, A beatles hit \\"Elenor Rigby\\" is on here, \\"Good Day Sunshine\\" and \\"Got To Get You Into My Life\\" good and very differant songs, and another beatles hit the very loveable \\"Yellow Submarine\\" is on here too. This album has got to get into your life. (yeah sorta bad pun or whatever sorry)
B000002WU9|5.0|A serious contender for the title of best Wu-Tang solo album. Only Built 4 Cuban Linx is also perhaps the most influential, thanks to Raekwon's cinematic imagination. If the Genius is the Wu's best overall lyricist, Raekwon is arguably their best storyteller, and here he translates the epic themes and narratives of a Mafia movie into a startlingly accomplished hip-hop album. RZA contributes some of the strongest production work of his career, indulging his taste for cinematic soundscapes in support of the album's tone; his tracks are appropriately dark or melancholy, shifting moods like different scenes in a film. Cuban Linx's first-person narratives are filled with paranoia, ambition, excess, and betrayal, fast rises and faster falls. There are plenty of highlights along the way -- the singles \\"Criminology\\" and \\"Ice Cream,\\" the gentle \\"Rainy Dayz,\\" the influential posse cut \\"Wu-Gambinos\\" -- and everything culminates in \\"Heaven & Hell\\" and its longing for redemption. Like the Genius' Liquid Swords, Only Built 4 Cuban Linx takes a few listens to reveal the full scope of its lyrical complexities, but it's immensely rewarding in the end, and it stands as a landmark in the new breed of gangsta rap.
B00070Q7VO|2.0|So, mine is the 45th critique on Amazon for \\"It's Time\\". Of the other 44, forty-two were all out raves with only two negatives. I'm the third not to be \\"blown away\\". I've bought every CD available by Michael...each time, hoping that this will be THE one. \\"It's Time\\" ain't it, yet! I'm an old-fashioned purist and grew up playing with big bands and collecting thousands of records, primarily of the Sinatra, Bennett, Fitzgerald, Christy, Connor, genre which Michael is trying to keep alive...or at least that's the way he's touted. I'm also a great admirer of David Foster, but the something's wrong with the Bubl-Foster collaboration. My best is advice is \\"you can't please ALL the people\\" and that's what I get with each Bubl CD...a little blues, a little R&B, some soft ballads, some country, a little of a lot but not a lot of lot of anything. I suppose he's trying to reach ALL of the 'older' sect but one cut is great and he follows it with something out of left field, which makes me want to skip over and get to the next.  <br />Michael's voice is actually a better instrument than Sinatra's. He's closer to Jack Jones of the 60's and that's terrific, but to me, he's or David is afraid to pick out one style and record and entire CD with songs that compliment one another. Sinatra or Nat King Cole would record albums with a theme...\\"Swingin' Lovers\\", \\"Only The Lonely\\", \\"Love Is The Thing\\". Personally, the best cut he's ever recorded was \\"That's All\\"...why can't he make an entire album of ballads OR swing OR blues OR an 'entire' ANYTHING? I'm even bothered by his inconsistency of phrasing...\\"I've 'gotchu' under my skin...I've 'got you' deep in the heart of me...\\". \\"GOTCHU\\"...style or an error? Chris Botti was entirely wasted on \\"Song For You\\". If you can only use his mellow trumpet on one song, why this?  <br />I, as the other two critics, are in the vast minority. I know that. But I grew up with the kind of music Michael is trying to interpret. He's got it all...the voice, the musicianship, the looks, the background musicians...EVERYTHING! Why can't it all fit together by trying to reach out to ALL audiences? Michael, I challenge you to make a theme album where everything...the songs, the style, the arrangements are all wrapped up in a single package. Let's hear a whole CD of \\"That's All\\" OR a whole CD of \\"A Foggy Day\\" and stick to the motif. Again, I'm disappointed with \\"It's Time\\". All the pieces are there...they just don't all belong to the same puzzle.
B00005JN2Z|3.0|Jamie Foxx is in a mellow mood when Tom Cruise enters his taxicab at Los Angeles International Airport.  He has just performed a kind deed by providing an attractive young lawyer who has expressed frustration and doubt over the success of the federal case she is in Los Angeles to prosecute a free ride, for which she was grateful and provided him with her card. <br /> <br />It turns out that this federal prosecutor, played by Jada Pinkett Smith, will be linked to Cruise, but this is something Foxx finds out later.  Initially Cruise behaves in the manner of the successful executive type he appears to be, articulate, well dressed and bemoaning the fact that Los Angeles is so spread out with people failing to connect.  He makes a comment that one can die in a Metropolitan Transit Authority vehicle without the death being discovered for hours. <br /> <br />The death comment contains a connection to what Cruise's profession turns out to be, to the shock of easy going Foxx.  Cruise takes him on an all-night mission as he seeks to eliminate witnesses in a federal drug case in which a leading syndicate being operated by a Los Angeles racketeer stands to be shut down and its principals sent to prison.   <br /> <br />Foxx attempts to shake loose of Cruise, but to no avail.  Cruise is so cold-blooded that he politely engages in a conversation about jazz and an appearance by the great Miles Davis with the operator of a club in the Leimert Park section of Los Angeles, who also plays the trumpet in the band.  After Cruise, Fox and the proprietor finish a relaxing drink the sociopathic hit man kills his cringing victim. <br /> <br />At one point, so suspicion will not be drawn toward Cruise, the hit man buys flowers for Foxx's sick mother and visits the hospital with him, where he is expected that evening.  Cruise makes a positive impression on Fox's mother through his engaging conversational manner.   <br /> <br />It is Foxx who undergoes the character change during the nerve-wracking evening.  The formerly easygoing taxi driver toughens up significantly under the strain of the moment.  He has a strong hunch that he is intended to be Cruise's last victim.  This is borne out by police records, which reveal a recent incident in which an Oakland cab driver committed alleged \\"suicide\\" under strange circumstances while some unsolved killings were being committed in the same areas he had traversed before his demise. <br /> <br />Foxx ultimately concludes that Jada Pinkett Smith is prosecuting the case in which Cruise is seeking to eliminate all federal witnesses, and that the prosecutor is the final target on the narcotics syndicate's hit list.  The story spins into high gear, along with Foxx's strategy mode, as he seeks to save her from what will otherwise be a swift and ruthless death performed by a killing automaton with no apparent conscience. <br /> <br />Michael Mann directed the film from a screenplay written by Stuart Beattie.  The crafty cinematography by Dion Beebe and Paul Cameron accent the rapidly paced action with bull's-eye close-ups of people battling for survival in Los Angeles as a vicious drug mob does battle with federal and local authorities.
B00008PX8P|4.0|I always new about Jimi Page's brilliance in the studio, but this awesome DVD has shown me that they were also a great live band. I love the stuff from 1970, but what surprised me is how good the stuff from 1979 on disc 2 is. If Bonham hadn't left us who knows what Zeppelin might have accomplished in the 1980's and beyond. Now, lets see some live Rolling Stones from the early seventies get released because although Zeppelin were great nobody can hold a candle to the Stones from 1968 to 1973. I mean that in terms of studio work (Beggars Banqet, Let it Bleed, Sticky Fingers, Exile on Main Street, and Goats Head Soup) and live performance (Get Your Ya Ya's out [Live 1969], the 1970 tour of Europe, 1971 UK tour, 1972 North American tour, 1973 European tour. It's no accident that Mick Taylor was with the Stones throughout those glory years.
B00023B1A8|5.0|I saw Crosby & Nash just last night in Manchester, the 21st February 2005 and for some, the dates matter and equally, the dates for others don't matter but when harmony is needed and all you really need is a reminder that beliefs & music do matter and can be a reminder of our stupidity and courage and pathways when music just had to be a balm, no matter what, we might buy this and remind ourselves that others are there.
B00070Q7VO|3.0|I really want to like this guy, I do, but everything I've heard from him sounds like \\"faux jazz,\\" a term I stole from a critic describing a track on Clay Aiken's Christmas album.  The arrangements are highly derivative (the arrangement for \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" was completely jacked from Nelson Riddle!) and are lukewarm at best.  It's like I'm listening to an American Jazz Idol cd, if there was ever such a thing (excuse the second reference to AI).  It's highly commerical and I never get the sense of true artistry from Bubl.  I think David Foster is the problem (hmm, let's see about this; he's mostly worked with pop singers...).   <br /> <br />Like Bubl's female crooner counterpart Jane Monheit (although I find the arrangements on her latest album to be slightly better), both have two of the best voices in the industry but neither have a sense of individuality like many other of today's jazz stars (i.e. Diana Krall, Norah Jones, Peter Cincotti, Harry Connick Jr., etc.).  There have been many comparisons made between Cincotti and Bubl, but other than being young and good-looking, the similarities end there.  Bubl has the better voice, but Cincotti has the better music (although it's arguable that a few of the songs on his sophomore album were not so great).  Is Foster/Bubl ASKING to be compared to Cincotti by including \\"You Don't Know Me\\" on this cd, like on their debuts they both had \\"Sway?\\"  Okay, well here it is: Cincotti's renditions of both songs are far superior.       <br /> <br />Saying all that, there are a couple of songs that are standouts: the bossa nova tinged \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\" (I LOVED Nelly Furtado's weathered voice paired against Bubl's smooth vocals and thought these two had a lot more chemistry than the Monheit and Bubl duet \\"I Won't Dance\\") and the earthy \\"Home.\\"   <br />   <br /> <br />
1570420521|4.0|this book, which was written a few decades ago seem more relevent today then ever, the lonliness and isolation that it describe, addiction ot TV and other technological invention as well as the search for spiritual understanding and attachment to other human seem even more true to our information revolutionalized society then it was back then.<br /><br />the book raises a lot of very interesting question, such as - what's human? what's murcy? what's religion and why we need faith? what are the things that makes us diffrent from one another, or the same? it talks about many importent theams such as raceizm, popular calture vs. religion, proggress and war.<br /><br />this is the story of a day in the life of an androide bounty hunter, and his meeting with an anroide that makes him question his beliefe about what's human and what's not as he hunt 6 androides who escaped from mars and found their way to earth. the diffrent charecters that he meets and that efect his life and view, such as his wife, his comandder, a fellow anrdoides hunter, a TV anchor and a god reflect on diffrent views about what's human and what's not, and answer that question, each in his \ her own way.<br /><br />i liked the audio version of this book a lot, mathew modin and Clarissa Flockhart are doing exelent job in bringing the plot and massage alive with many diffrent accent and intonation for the diffrent charecters, and it was very fun to listen to it. a lot of audio books feel dry and read from the book but this one have more of a feel of seeing a play or a show, which make it more entertining to listen to.
B000002LMK|5.0|The songs on this album are outstanding, the writing is direct, the themes are the same ones Neil has always sung about, making relationships last over time, country living, the road.  But the way this album was recorded is probably the main reason I keep coming back.  Obviously the guitars are all melting and the amps are overdriven and the songs are free-form, but the vocals are right where I want them, and the guitars are so warm that the album never agitates me (and believe me, I've listened to some agitating music - Teengenerate anyone?).  I guess the fifth star is gained by the fact that the songs and the band are still more important than the medium, this album isn't noteworthy for its use of feedback and hot guitars, but because everything fits, in a smooth and soulful way.  Never gimmick.  Always authentic.  Neil transcends the genre again.

0385510454|1.0|I have never expected Grisham to be some incredible literary giant-just to give us exciting, suspenseful, entertaining reads.  He fails miserably with THE BROKER.  I found myself at times actually skimming pages, during the overboard Italian lessons and travelogue.  I have felt for quite sometime that a Grisham read has become more and more like reading a screenplay, and this one is no exception. <br /> <br />It feels like he got stuck in the Bologna details for so long that suddenly he had a publication deadline looming (since we MUST put out one a year-keep the cash machine churning), so let's just put a nice little bow on things and go home!  No development of any subplots, strange emphasis on characters who come out of nowhere (the lady on the train), and too many loose ends-ok, the Israelis are gone, what about the RC goon, and the Saudis?  Just left hanging... <br /> <br />Beginning to get leery of spending my money on his work.  Oh the salad days of A Time to Kill, The Firm, and Pelican Brief!

B00005JMEW|5.0|This movie is amazing in its well choreographed and intense samurai death scenes.  Blood spraying like well planned downpours of rain with the unique and well placed use of Black and White film in a portion, the scene is just transfixing. <br /> <br />The entire movie is like that, and it all is Uma.  Uma makes it work.  Uma does what is clearly the impossible in this film, but with her steel cold blue eyes, she makes it work.  Every bit of it.  The choreography and execution of the scenes is edited flawlessly.  And the realism of the film is gripping. <br /> <br />The film is especially recommended for all who like martial arts films.  And those who like Quentin Tarantino's terrifically talented recent work.

0312954468|5.0|After viewing an Ancient Egypt show on the History Channel, I decided to depart from my predominant obsession with thrillers and seek some historical fiction for a diversion. River God was a first for me in this genre and I was so blown away with the crisp, rich, inventive, and exciting tale-telling that I read everything I could find, including all of Smith's books. River God (and the others in this series on Egypt) set such a lofty standard that I may never recover enough to fully appreciate the works of others in this category. Granted, historians and purists may take issue with the historical accuracy but when writing like this has the capacity to captivate your interest and emotions so completely, who cares? It's not a textbook and not promoted as one. I've got to say, I read (and write) a lot, and this is a top-shelf tale that blew me away. I have recommended it to numerous friends and not one has been disappointed. Bravo, Mr. Smith. Thanks for introducing a new excitement into my life.

B00028HBKM|5.0|Mel Gibson has created a masterpiece. He carved this film out of his bleeding heart. I, as a Jew, did not feel offended by it. On the contrary, I was proud that Jesus Christ was  Jewish. I never agreed to the antagonistic approach of the rabbis concerning Jesus.  Jesus Christ's prophecy was addressed to the jews initially. His godly message turned it into a universal message.  <br />The film is brilliantly directed. The actors are wonderful. Their anonimity adds to the quality of their acting. However, what gives this film its uniqueness is the compassion and love it reflects. I loved it.

B00063MBU8|5.0|For weeks before this CD was released, I read all the articles and press releases pertaining to it, but I was still unable to comprehend what this band might be all about. Were they some sort of assassins sent to my bedroom to shoot my face off, or was their plan something more sinister? Do they like harder ess E ex with girls? Might this just be another \\"Jack's playground,\\" as it were? As the release date came and went, I forgot about the record altogether and began to feel uncomfortable, like I was molesting the band or something. Of course I wasn't, but what I was molesting I suppose I shouldn't mention, for fear of litigation.  <br /> <br />The point is, I bought the CD weeks after it was released, expecting actual music, rather than the good \\"wrist slicer\\" that I got, and I have to say that the thoughtless lame-ass weak lyrics in these songs are disgusting. The best track here is \\"Hurray for Knight Rider's D***.\\" I can enjoy that sentiment as much as anyone else. Apparently, this song is based on some sort of televised playacting that I'm not familiar with. A sample of the juvenile lyrics: \\"Slice, slice, slice those wrists. Open them up. Spread the cut like it's ga*h shot in a p*rn mag.\\"  <br /> <br />Needless to day, this is the best CD ever, although there are some low points. I have trouble describing such things, as when I do, I begin to convulse violently, so I'll refrain from such descriptions here. Let me just say one thing. The track \\"The Touring Fag**ts\\" is truly terrible.
B0001KZM3O|5.0|The 12th studio album that was done by Pink Floyd is also the most polarizing one - it is one that is either loved or hated.    I remember when I first got into Floyd; I was absolutely mesmerized by the whole package - lyrics, sound effects, guitar solos, the whole 9 yards.  Of course, I consider myself a firm Gilmour man and don't get me wrong - Dave is still my all-time favorite guitarist.  However, the more I listened to the Roger dominated albums like \\"Animals\\", \\"The Wall\\", and \\"The Final Cut\\" compared to what came out after this album, it is no contest to me - Roger was TRULY Pink Floyd.  Yea, Gilmour is the better musician and the better singer, but he can't write songs like Roger can and he definitely does not have the creative vision of a Waters.    People are right in that \\"The Final Cut\\" is essentially more of a solo album for Roger than an actual Floyd album but what about \\"A Momentary Lapse of Reason\\"?  That album didn't even have Rick Wright or Waters and Nick Mason appears on only half that album - so, if \\"The Final Cut\\" is indeed Roger's first solo album, then AMLOR is Gilmour's 3rd solo album.  The point of mentioning this is to simply say that Roger Waters is not the only person in Floyd who tried to pass off a solo album as a \\"Floyd album\\" - so it gets tiresome to read when people complain about that with \\"The Final Cut\\" but never mention the next \\"Floyd album\\".    The point is that no one truly knows what was going on with Roger at that time in his life - the dude was having some serious issues, but he was still able to put together some amazing stuff.  Sure the lack of guitar solos is disappointing, but when they do appear in songs like \\"The Post War Dream\\", \\"The Fletcher Memorial Home\\", and \\"Not Now John\\", they are simply outstanding.  It is like their infrequent use makes them that more powerful when they do appear.  But some of the other tracks are just amazing to me, especially after repeated listens like \\"The Gunner's Dream\\", \\"The Final Cut\\", and especially \\"When the Tigers Broke Free\\" (one of the saddest Floyd songs ever).      If you enjoyed \\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall\\" more than the other Floyd stuff, I feel that you will enjoy \\"The Final Cut\\".  If \\"Animals\\" and \\"The Wall\\" were your least-favored Floyd albums, you will probably have a tough time with \\"The Final Cut\\", but just go into it with an open mind and give it a chance.  If you happen to enjoy \\"The Final Cut\\", you must buy Roger's solo stuff, especially \\"Amused to Death\\" (the best solo album by any member of Floyd although Gillmour's first solo album is pretty damn good) and \\"The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\\".    Personally, \\"The Final Cut\\" is just behind \\"Meddle\\" for me in terms of favorite Floyd albums and #6 overall - \\"Animals\\", \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"The Wall\\", \\"Wish You Were Here\\", and \\"Meddle\\" then \\"The Final Cut\\".

0671027344|5.0|This poignant story of a teen boy trying to find his way in the world is a great read, that both teens and adults will enjoy.  Charlie is a complex and well-developed character and the letters he writes to his mysterious \\"friend\\" convey the roller-coaster emotions of his freshman year in high school.  The letters also explore events in Charlie's life before high school, including his best friend's suicide, his favorite aunt's turbulent life and untimely death in a car accident, and how he witnessed his father secretly crying during the finale of the TV series M*A*S*H, and how these events color his way of thinking about the world.  Charlie often finds himself caught between taking action and standing back and being an observer, a \\"wallflower\\" in matters of friendship, love, and family relationships.  The uncertainty of adolescence is brilliantly illustrated in this book through its earnest and genuine protagonist.
0670033693|5.0|_The Cold Dish_ by Craig Johnson is an excellent debut mystery.<br /><br />If you like C. J. Box, you'll like this, too.  The book is set in a small<br /><br />town in Wyoming and follows Absaroka County sheriff Walt Longmire<br /><br />as he investigates what at first appears to be a hunting accident.<br /><br />Young Cody Pritchard is found shot to death in a remote area, but<br /><br />there's nothing to suggest that his death is anything more than an<br /><br />unfortunate accident, although the bullet that killed him was fired<br /><br />from an unusually large caliber gun.  Several years earlier, though,<br /><br />Cody was one of a group of four young men who raped an Indian<br /><br />woman and when another of the group is also found killed, it begins<br /><br />to seem that someone is out for revenge.  And when it is discovered<br /><br />that the murder weapon is a Sharps buffalo rifle, Longmire's list of<br /><br />suspects is cut down considerably, to those who own such a gun<br /><br />and those who are proficient enough to make the long-range shot.<br /><br />Longmire is a great character--he's middle-aged and only recently has<br /><br />he become a widower.  He lives in a half-finished cabin out in the<br /><br />country and seems content with the pig sty nature of his living<br /><br />quarters.  He's got a group of deputies that include Victoria Moretti,<br /><br />transplanted from Philadelphia when her husband moved west for<br /><br />a job, and Turk, the nephew of Walt's predecessor, a guy with a big<br /><br />head who thinks he's Walt's logical successor.  The dispatcher, Ruby,<br /><br />is a kindly older woman who keeps Walt grounded when he gets<br /><br />depressed.  Walt's best friend is Henry Standing Bear, a Cheyenne<br /><br />Indian who owns a local bar and just happens to be the uncle of the<br /><br />girl who was raped--he's bothered that Walt can even momentarily<br /><br />think he's capable of murder..<br /><br />There's a great sense of setting and atmosphere in the book.  It's the<br /><br />fall and the first signs of winter are making a show.  At one point, there's<br /><br />a great sequence in the middle of a raging blizzard where Walt has to<br /><br />carry a couple of injured parties out from a possible crime scene.  The<br /><br />descriptions of the howling wind and blinding snow and Walt's near<br /><br />exhaustion are palpable.  There's a good-natured humor that runs<br /><br />throughout the book, too, particularly in the interactions between Walt<br /><br />and Henry.<br /><br />I can't remember the last time I enjoyed a book so much.  This is easily one<br /><br />of the best debuts I've read in a long time and I'll be eagerly looking forward<br /><br />to Johnson's next (this book is advertised as the start of a series).

0670880728|4.0|Much has been written about both this book and the movie it spawned, but briefly, the book is a glimpse into a year in the life of Bridget Jones, as revealed by her diary.  She starts the year, as so many of us do, by listing her New Year's resolutions, and then uses her diary to track her progress.  Her weight and alcohol, cigarette, and calorie consumption begin each entry, along with number of obsessive thoughts, times she dialed 1471 (Brit equivalent of *69 to see who last rang you), etc. <br /> <br />I started off thinking how shallow, ridiculous, insecure, irritating, and immature Bridget and her friends were.  They seemed to earn my disdain on every page: wailing about being thirty-something and single, how men are beasts, and yet also how dull the Smug Marrieds are.  And yet, as I went through Bridget's year with her, I started to almost kind of like her.  And I even saw myself in her sometimes (though was loath to admit it).  And I definitely started to root for her. <br /> <br />The diary style lets you hear a character in a natural voice, with abbreviations, slang, and cussing.  It's also a good primer for British slang, though you have to get most of it from context, which was kind of fun. <br /> <br />In the end, it's just a silly, fun book about a character who, if you look past the high exaggeration of her flaws, is not that different from any of us. <br /> <br />I liked Olivia Joules and the Overactive Imagination, also by Fielding, a little better, mainly because the main character had a bit more depth and a bit less whining to her.

B0002OERI0|4.0|Call it whatever you want; punk, pop-punk, whatever it is, you cant talk about it withour mentioning Green Day. They have been a strong force in punk music for almost a decade. This album is a great album, definitely a 4 and a half star album. The only thing is, this isn't old Green Day. If you want old Green Day then you'd better dig into your old copies of Dookie because American Idiot definitely isnt Dookie. A.I. is a lot less punkish, more poppish true. Normally I would be the first one screaming REVOLT! if a band as talented as Green Day decided to leave their roots behind. The thing is, when other bands do it, quite honestly they suck. Green Day has made a great rock album, because no matter how much they change or \\"evolve\\", Billie Joe, Tre, and Mike will always be Green Day. <br /> <br />Check out: <br />Jesus of Suburbia <br />Letterbomb <br />American Idiot (hated it at first, this one had to grow on me but now I love it) <br />She's a Rebel <br /> <br />I suggest if you're considering whether or not to buy this album you check out these songs, download them or hear sneak peeks or whatever. If they dont pique your interest then maybe this one isnt for you.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ok, here is another glowing endorsement. I am a SF fan, but did not catch Firefly when it orginially aired. Space/cowboy show? Sounded corny. This week a friend bought me the DVD set. Wow, I am a new convert. I watched all the episodes in about 2 days. I am starting to watch my favorite ones over again. I would not discribe it as SF. It is a unique fictional entertainment that is adult fun at a very high level. It does have enough technology/science to get the charactors from one planet to another, but tech/sci does not get in the way of the story. Magic tech/sci tricks don't get our charactors out of trouble. They get into trouble because of actions driven by human nature, they get out of trouble through thoughtful decisions, strong will and luck.  The 9 central charactors work together as a team, but have conflicts and known and unknown motives for their actions. I cared about the charactors. Tears sometimes came to my eyes for short term charactors that were only in one episode. The series had fun, humor and danger and mystery and just enough good space scenes to keep an old SF fan like myself dazzled. I promise you if you buy this DVD set, you will not be sorry. I expect this will be a classic in fiction for decades to come.

B00008O89K|5.0|I don't see any point in writing a long review. This isn't the kind of music that can be described in words, any more than Beethoven's Fifth or Ninth can be described in words, and the Conan soundtrack is like both of those rolled into one. You can throw around words like \\"huge\\", \\"epic\\", \\"glorious\\", \\"soaring\\", etc., and they still fall far short. Kettle drums like mountains falling from the sky. Brass like the charge of an army of immortals. Power beyond mortal comprehension and beauty beyond human sight. This isn't just the best movie soundtrack ever created, it is the best classical music composed in the last half of the twentieth century. If you don't possess it, that is a flaw in your character that you should remedy immediately.    (note added on the event of the death of Basil Poledouris: let all who read this review, however few or many they are, know that there are those of us who regard this work as some others regard Wagner: the peak of music, the soundtrack to our soul, the gospel music of our religion. Its composer, or, better, the medium who channeled it to our lesser sphere, is gone now from our stream of time -- but music, and spirit, exist outside that stream. BP RIP)
0765309408|3.0|Not a long book by today's standards, Old Man's War starts off well, with interesting ideas, humour, and fairly interesting characters.  But, the book ends on a down note, with the last third of the book being plagued by too many coincidences involving the main character(at least 2 or 3 too many), none of the humour found in the beginning of the book, and a series of generally mundane battle sequences.<br /><br />I give it 3 1/2 stars, rounded down to 3 stars.<br /><br />I suppose if dressed up right, this story could evolve into a TV or movie screenplay.
B0006OBPTA|5.0|Finally, all the movies together in a single package.  I have been enthralled with the Karate Kid since seeing the first one back in 1984.  I think I am in a rare minority here in that I actually like all four of the movies, one and two still having a higher preference though.  The biggest reason I like all four is without a doubt because of the depth of character of Mr. Miyagi.  I remember my first Sensei talked almost the same way, which was a big deal to me when I first saw Karate Kid since he did this before the popularity of the movie.  This for some reason had a profound and lasting effect.  I read somewhere the Pat Morita built most of the Miyagi character on the fly and I think he did an awesome job of this throughout all the movies.  The continuing philosophy and mentality throughout all four movies alone was well worth the price.  Of course my wife and kids are getting insanely tired of me quoting Mr. M.  \\"BONZAIIII!!!!!\\"

B000002LMK|5.0|<br />From all of Neil different bands and styles I  would have to say that Crazy Horse are my favourite. Not by a huge margin though. Its incredible that Neil was so far gone from popularity and prominance in the 80s and came back with a series of albums beginning with Freedom (1989) that are as great and influential as any of his earlier work. Refering to Michael A Beyers comment about scraping in with a good 80's album with Freedom, I think 1980s Hawks and Doves beats freedom hands down. Anyway, Ragged Glory is up there with his best work. Im not going to compare it to his albums with different bands because its pointless. However, I would say the greatest Crazy Horse album would have to be either Everybody Knows This is Nowhere (1969) or Zuma (1975). Rust never sleeps is slightly eclipsed by Live Rust and Ragged Glory by Weld- the 2 cd live album with 5 songs from Ragged Glory all sounding better than their album versions plus the rest of the 2 cds filled with grunged out versions of classic Crazy Horse.  <br />Therefore I would reccomend Weld instead of this for the casual fan but both are neccessary for the hardcore RUSTIE!!!.

B0006Z2LH4|4.0|I have not seen CUBE 1, but have seen CUBE 2. I thought Hypercube was ok, but not very good. CUBE:ZERO however, is everything that Hypercube was not.    I won't bother with too much of a detailed synposis. Same story, people wake up in the CUBE, not knowing how they got there. The difference in this story from the previous one is that in CUBE ZERO, they also seem to have also lost their memory of who they were before the CUBE also. The CUBE is just that, a CUBE shaped room with doors on all six sides that lead to other CUBE rooms. The only catch, some of the rooms are death traps. And not nice death traps either, very gruesome traps. The rooms can move around also!    The story half involves the people in the CUBE, just as in the previous CUBE's. However, the other half of the story, the more interesting part, is the story of a guy who's outside the CUBE who is actually an operator of the CUBE. He starts to ask too many questions, and figures out that all is not what it seems.    First off, the CUBE is SO MUCH COOLER! It's much more colder, mechanical, realistic, then the hypercube. Even though the rooms are identical, they are illuminated in different colors, which helped break up the same-ness of all the rooms.    The traps in CUBE:ZERO were so much more gruesome and realistic then the terrible completely fakey computer generated traps in the Hypercube.    There is something to be said about not revealing too much or explaining too much in a movie, because your own imagination can be so much more creative. CUBE:ZERO doesn't reveal too much, but reveals just enough of what's going on. They talk about the how and the what, they don't really explain the why though, and that's fine, because that's up to you to explain. People who were frustrated with the whole \\"you only think it's cool cause it doesn't make any sense\\" thing will be much happier with CUBE : ZERO. It makes just enough sense, but not too much sense!    Once again, like Hypercube, this is NOT a horror movie. It's a sci-fi movie that is reminiscient of a outer limits / twighlight zone / X-files type of story. Sure, there's some horror elements in it, and it's much more of a horror-type story then hypercube, but it's still not a horrow movie. I'd say it's very close to like Hellraiser 2 as far as some of the ways that people get killed. But it's definitely a dark sci-fi movie. Similar in darkness to \\"Dark City\\", however, with blood and gore. In fact, those who have seen Dark City will probably raise an eyebrow or two when they reveal the names of a couple of the \\"suits\\" who come down from \\"upstairs\\".     I have not seen CUBE, but I plan to see it the very next time it's available to rent. I have seen Hypercube though, and I have to say that CUBE ZERO is a THOUSAND times better than Hypercube. In Hypercube, you want to know what's going on, and find out what happens, but you could give a darn who died and how. The characters were so unlikeable that their deaths were meaningless. But in CUBE ZERO, you actually feel sorry for the people trapped in the cube, for the most part, and hope that they find a way out.    The set, the special effects, are a thousand times better than Hypercube. In fact, it's so much more better, that the titles Hypercube and CUBE ZERO should not even be uttered in the same breath. CUBE ZERO was all that I hoped it could be. This was a movie that I could have easily watched in a movie theater. The only thing I really hated about it was that the end is left wide open, with just as many new questions to be asked, as were answered in the movie.     Update:  Since I originally wrote this, I actually got to see CUBE 1. After seeing it, I now know why people thought the original CUBE was so great. However, I don't think it's so much more better than CUBE : ZERO.     I think that there are some things in CUBE that are better than CZ, and I think that CZ has a few things that are better than CUBE. They really compliment each other. CZ is supposed to be apre-quel to CUBE, so I thought it EXTRA COOL that the very last seen in CZ was the very first seen in CUBE. It really tied them together. I think anybody who enjoyed the original CUBE will love CZ, and the other way around also.     Whatever you do though, if you haven't yet seen Hypercube, DON'T! It is REALLY REALLY BAD.    CUBE and CZ go hand in hand. It's as if one was made right after the other. I hope you found this review helpful!

B0006SSOHC|4.0|Beyond a doubt, this is one of the sickest, creepiest, strange, wierd horror/psychological thrillers you will ever see.  I rate it right up there with Takashi Miike's \\"Audition\\".  If you like to be scared...I mean really freaked out...this one's for you!
B0002XDODU|5.0|I really love this cd. If you like Rammstein (and I do) you should own this cd!
B000002JSN|5.0|Led Zeppelin did it again. Another brilliant album. With songs such as Kashmir, Houses of the Holy, and In My Time of Dying. To me this is by far the best Zep album. <br /> <br />If you listen to In My Time of Dying, at the end somebody coughs. Then Robert Plant sings \\"Cough\\". I just thought that was pretty funny. <br /> <br />If I had to choose a favorite song out of the two cds, it would have to be Kashmir.  But Houses of the Holy is a close second.  <br /> <br />Other great songs included are: Custard Pie, Bron-Yr-Aur, In the light, and if you like a little blues, Ten Years Gone is the song for you.  THIS LED ZEPPELIN ALBUM ROCKS.
B0000714BP|5.0|It's been quite a few years since I've seen Too Wong Foo, but I was estatic when I found a copy of it at bargain bin at Wal-Mart.  It truly was a bargain for one of the most engaging, and delightful movies I've ever had the opprotunity to see.  Ten years was way too long to wait for me!!! <br />I think it's incredibly fantastic that these three A-List actors had the courage to take on the roles of drag queens, because it takes alot to fill such glamorous shoes, especially when two of the three actors are known for playing such macho roles!  Kudos to Patrick Swayze, Wesley Snipes, and John Leguizamo for making this movie.   <br />I strongly suggest that if you're looking for a movie with glamour and giggles, I suggest you pick up this DVD.  It's well worth it! <br />
0142000655|5.0|I recently did a term paper on Steinbeck's East of Eden. At first, the sheer length of the work seemed daunting, however once I delved into it, the text captivated me. This is my favorite book EVER. Steinbeck is a genius. read this book.
B00005JNJ7|4.0|Mat Stone and Tray Parker have done it again... well sort of.  The creators of those ingrate children of South Park bring you a new movie full of..of...um...puppets.  The movie follows the trials and victories of \\"Team America\\" the super police force of the world.  These super cops, police the world and an effort to keep evil puppets on a very short string (bad pun I'm sorry).  Now their most powerful, cunning, and lonely villain is plotting to destroy the world, the villain is the one, the only Kim Jong IL of North Korea.  With his army of \\"terrorists\\" little Kim plots to throw the world into upheaval.  But IL is not the only foe they will face, they will combat the members of the Film Actors Guild, (aka F.A.G: includes such stars like Samuel L. Jackson, Alec Baldwin, and Mat Damon, to name a few).  So lights, camera,....... Puppet SEX! (Yes I said puppet sex). <br /> Now that you know the nuts, bolts and strings of the flick time to get to the review (yea!!!!!!!!!!!!).  Well let me just start by saying................ Um Wow.  This movie was f**king hilarious, no joke kids, it's a gut buster.  You'll laugh, you'll cry, and you'll cringe all the way through this movie.  Mat and Tray have managed to make yet another outrageously funny flick.  There were times I was in danger of peeing myself and other times I was just kind'a ashamed for laughing.  I couldn't believe the stuff they got a way with in this movie, not to mention what they were making the puppets do.  I mean it's not every day you see puppets having sex, and lots of sex at that ( you'd be surprised at how many positions you can get a puppet into).  I'm sure Pinocchio never got wood like these string danglers, and I'm sure the people at the Jim Henson Company never thought puppets could be so......um......... saucy.  It's got every thing you need to laugh and feel dirty all in one 2 hour fart joke.    <br /> Now if you're looking for a serious peak into the realm of world politics and America's worldly tactics, then go watch CNN or the O'Reilly Factor.  If you're going into this movie I warn you to leave your tight a** political agenda at the box office.  If you're not a fan of the South Parks boys, or you take US and World politics too damn serious then this movie is going to piss you the f**k off.  If you do not have a sense of humor this movie will destroy you and you will leave up set and damaged and \\"If you can't take a joke, then go the f**k home\\".
0880389052|3.0|If you're a fan of the Forgotten Realms world of books, all 200 of them, or if you're a fan of D&D books then you'll probably completely disagree with this review. I'm writing this review as a casual reader, this being my first introduction to the Forgotten Realms world.     Homeland is the beginning of a three part trilogy that tells the story of Drizzt Do'Urden and starts at this birth. Drizzt Do'Urden is a dark elf, a race of folk that thrive on battle and destruction and the major conflict in this book is Drizzt coming to terms with his race and deciding whether or not he agrees with their ways.    Overall, the book is very entertaining. The world is very interesting and the variety of creatures and races that live with in. The characters are for the most part rather interesting but I was more interested in the action scenes of the book than the parts where any sort of dialogue or character exposition takes place. The battles are presented here aplenty so if you're a fan of good action sequences in books then you've found a very good book for that with Homeland. However, I felt that at times the battles dragged on for a bit and the outcomes were rather predictable.     There is some political intrigue in the form of houses vying for power but it's mostly basic and doesn't have too much depth to it. The various houses presented aside from the Do'Urden household don't have much in terms of the story so the storyline is fairly straightforward in that aspect as we only follow one house to a rather predictable outcome. The individual characters themselves are rather basic archetypes, the mean mother, the wise and strong father, the wicked sisters, and devious wizards are all presented here in rather basic formats. They're not particular well developed either so when a character dies I found myself not caring as there's no emotional attachment to any of the side characters besides Drizzt and we all know he's not going anywhere.     Even though the book had numerous faults, it was still a worthwhile read and I enjoyed quite a lot. There was a lot of originality in the beautifully crafted world and interesting creatures. The characters and storyline weren't particularly deep but moved along at a good pace with well written battles and action sequences. I'll most likely continue with the trilogy because this book shows promise. If you're looking for a fun, fast read with well written action sequences then this book is for you. However, if you're looking for deep political intrigue and a good cast of well developed characters then look elsewhere.
1400043662|4.0|Yet again, Murakami has created a world of enigmas and spacious silences that, on his terms, makes a kind of sense.  The other reviewers are right to point out that there are loose ends not tied up, but that seems minor when the characters and settings were so memorable.  The library on Shikoku, for example, is cleanly fixed in my mind, quiet as a house painted by De Chrico; the conversations betweeen the trucker and Nakata were classic road trip dialogue; the relations among Oshima, Kafka and Miss Saeki are beautifully, patiently drawn.  This novel is gorgeous. <br /> <br />So it's not the Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, which I read five years ago and still reverberates with me.  It's still well worth reading - twice for that matter. <br /> <br />Finally, check out the excellent website Murakami's American publishers have done at [...]  There are two interviews with him and an interesting translators' round table.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|Apparently, \\"Saw\\" is a movie people either hate or love.  I thought it was great as it put an new twist on the psycho killer/horror genre.  Sure, people are saying it's a ripoff of \\"Seven\\" but it's really not - other than the killer has an imagination and the director of the film has an amazing way with visuals.  Directed and written by two Australians, one of whom (Leigh Whannell) also makes his film debut as one of the \\"Jigsaw Killer\\"'s victims, I thought this an extremely creepy film.  Whoever did the production design did an excellent job - just \\"The Helmet\\" sequence alone was enough to freak me out.  And that...MASK!!!  Also, the question the movie poses:  What WOULD it take for you to mutilate yourself/kill another/etc. to ensure your own survival and/or that of your loved ones was something to ponder.  There are some great twists in the film and, for such a low-budget effort (filmed in 18 days!!), a great cast (Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter), all to scare the hell out of you!!  Ignore the \\"professional\\" reviewers and just go rent this movie - it IS a good one!!
B00002MZ4W|5.0|There are only 10 songs/tracks on this CD, but they are all incredible.  \\"Paper Bag\\" is beautiful beyond words.

1591396190|4.0|Market clutter is real.  Too many products compete for satiated consumers, offering fine and often imagined distinctions.  The TV program The Persuaders vividly demonstrates the amount of money and effort put into a usually vain attempt to differentiate my product by persuading consumers that, if they use it and not its competitors, their entire emotional life and relationships will be transformed. <br /> <br />A book that suggests strategies for side-stepping head-on competition and reduces these complexities to six principles therefore sounds like a sure-fire winner - if it actually delivers what it claims.  Blue Ocean Strategy provides engaging packaging of sound and well-accepted strategic marketing principles, together with a clear and useful exposition of steps to success.  It is also useful in focusing attention on the big picture of identifying real gaps in the market, rather than on mere feature matching.  But the claim that this process results in \\"creating uncontested market space [which makes] the competition irrelevant\\" overstates the reality, even if this is occasionally achieved.  <br /> <br />My first reaction to seeing the book was that it would revisit the subject of Hamel & Prahalad's excellent 1994 book Competing for the Future.  Although there are similarities, the focus is in fact different. Competing for the Future is concerned with business strategy and industry definition, while Blue Ocean Strategy is concerned with the marketing strategy of a company.  The distinction is important, and allows Kim and Mauborgne to ignore important questions of wider industry and economic development that Hamel & Prahalad treat well. <br /> <br />The 'six principles' in Blue Ocean Strategy, each of which is covered in a separate chapter are: <br />1. Reconstruct market boundaries <br />2. Focus on the big picture, not the numbers <br />3. Reach beyond existing demand <br />4. Get the strategic sequence right <br />5. Overcome key organizational hurdles <br />6. Build execution into strategy <br />The detailed discussion and advice in each chapter is clearly set out and useful, even if much of it simply draws on established principles of sound business and marketing practice. <br /> <br />The authors also offer two key analytical frameworks.  The first takes the form of a chart that lists key competitive factors (price, product features, elements of appeal, etc) in a way that allows visual comparison between products as to the reliance on each element (which the authors call the 'value curve'), and also allows new appeal features to be added.  The second provides a systematic approach to analysing which features should be created, raised, reduced or eliminated in order to create a new and distinctly different value curve.  Using these tools and other subsidiary tools, the authors work through processes for reconceptualizing markets and building distinctive competitive advantage.  My impression is that the key to value of the chart is how perceptive you can be in identifying or creating the factors that you choose to monitor by means of the chart.
0060763280|5.0|Harv Eker precisely addressed many of my personal issues with creating wealth and now I know what to do about them. The book was funny, on the mark, and was just a pleasure to read. It is a very well-designed book, too. Sure, there are some ideas and quotes in the book that I've seen before, but they were placed in a fresh context (including plenty of personal stories) that shed a new, clear light on the topics.<br /><br />Knowing what I know now after reading the book, it is worth five times what I paid for it. If you're like me with several failed or mediocre businesses under your belt, this book will help you see past your bad programming and play a far better inner game. I keep hearing Harv Eker ask, \\"Let me see, you're broke, aren't you?\\" After you read this book, you'll KNOW what the answer to that question is and can be. For me, personally, this is one of the most important books I've read. It was a ballpeen hammer between the eyes. Something kept telling me, \\"Buy that book!\\" I'm so glad I listened for a change.
1591391105|4.0|The book is structured on the proposition that the actions of a leader or manager in a new position during their first 90 days largely determines their ultimate success or failure. Further, a manager 'consumes value' in the early days while he or she is getting established, before being able to 'create value'. The shorter this period is, the better for both the company and the individual. <br /> <br />The author bases his case on five core propositions and ten success strategies (these are reflected in the chapter titles. The core propositions are: <br /> <br />1. The root causes of transition failure always lie in a pernicious interaction between the situation, with its opportunities and pitfalls, and the individual, with his or her strengths and vulnerabilities. (Transition failures happen when new leaders either misunderstand the essential demands of the situation or lack the skill and flexibility to adapt to them.) <br />2. There are systematic methods that leaders can employ to both lessen the likelihood of failure and reach the break-even point faster. (Every situation is unique, but the fundamentals of appropriate strategies are common.) <br />3. The overriding goal in a transition is to build momentum by creating virtuous cycles that build credibility and by avoiding getting caught in vicious cycles that damage credibility. <br />4. Transitions are a crucible for leadership development and should be managed accordingly. (Transition acceleration skills should be taught, so that talented people do not drown unnecessarily.) <br />5. Successful adoption of a standard framework for accelerating transitions can yield big returns for organizations. (A very large number of transitions occur each year in large organizations. The scope for improved productivity and results from better attention to improved transitions is enormous.) <br /> <br />The book develops these propositions by working through the success strategies in detail. <br /> <br />While the advice is valuable and well-structured, it is rather too much of a catalogue focusing on a series of individual strategies to follow, where the situation requires a systemic approach. In consequence, I question whether it is complete. For example, there is little direct discussion of a key issue for leaders in organisations which focus on the short term bottom line: a new entrant at every level very often faces the delayed unintended consequences of a predecessor's actions designed to produce a lift 'this quarter'. These longer term consequences may be deep-seated, potentially devastating - and well hidden. It could be argued that failure to identify and deal with these in time is the major underlying cause of perceived failure of new managers.
B000002P5W|5.0|Jimi displays a confidence not often seen on an artist's sophomore album. Most of the tracks on this album could have been recorded yesterday and would still hold up as contemporary. His command of studio trickery was beginning to come to light, and Jimi offers material that appeals to fans of his previous LP, as well as material that shows what mastery was to yet to come. The album starts off with a bit of fun with \\"EXP\\" as Jimi becomes Paul Caruso, a space alien with a sense of humor. Voices are speeded up and slowed down for the interview and then the guitar becomes the spaceship for this ride as Jimi wrestles feedback out of it and pans it from channel to channel. As the feedback swirls, it pans from speaker to speaker giving the effect of a circular movement. Although a bit pedestrian now, it was very advanced for it's time.  We then slide into the slippery blues of \\"Up From the Skies\\" with Jimi furiously wah-wahing away. His lazy vocal gives this song a laid-back relaxed feeling which is quite enjoyable. Jimi then repays a visit to \\"Are You Experienced?\\" territory with the hard rocking \\"Spanish Castle Magic\\". The rhythm section gets kudos here, in a display showing their trademark tightness. Mitch Mitchell especially gives his drumkit a workout on this track. Jimi slows the tempo back down to a more relaxing tone on \\"Wait Until Tomorrow\\", a great story about a boy and a girl who want to run away together, escapism being a recurring theme in this album. \\"Ain't No Telling\\" is a one of the weaker tracks here, but still points to the future as his guitar shadows the vocals with a very jazzy tone, a technique he would utilize more on the next LP, the landmark \\"Electric Ladyland\\". \\"Little Wing\\" another ballad revisits the escapism theme again and is one Jimi's most beloved tracks. \\"If 6 Was 9\\" is the song that links Jimi's hard rock past with his experimental future. The song begins as a pounding precursor to heavy metal, and if you concentrate really hard you can smell the smoke coming from Mitch Mitchell's drum kit. Marvel along with Jimi's wails and wah wahs, Mitch's phased and swirling snare fills and Noel Redding's solid bass thumps. Toward the end of the song it evolves into a bluesy rave up and then implodes into an etheral song to the heavens. \\"You Got Me Floating\\" is a nod to the future in which Jimi singlehandly invents funk. It is an amazing song, and though very far ahead of it's time, still nods to both past and future.\\"Castles Made of Sand\\", another ballad again returns to escapism, and shows how gifted a lyricist Hendrix was. This is a song I often refer to show all sides of Hendrix' genius. The backwards guitar solo is amazing. \\"She's So Fine\\" is one of the few songs on this LP that sound dated, but it was basically Noel Redding's vehicle so it can be forgiven. \\"One Rainy Wish\\" is a track that sounds like something thrown together as filler, and is also a weak track, the lyrics sound like something written while on an acid trip. \\"Little Miss Lover\\" is a return to greatness that expands upon the funk of \\"Floating\\" even more hard rock feeling. Another nod to both past and future! \\"Bold As Love\\" is the most amazing song Jimi Hendrix ever created, it is basically the first power ballad, and is just a beautiful piece of art. Listen to the majesty of Hendrix' solos, especially the return after the false ending (when Mitch Mitchell does another beautiful phased out drum fill) when Jimi does the most heart wrenching solo of his short life over the phased and flanged backing track. This song succeeds on so many levels it would take an entry as long as this whole review to describe it. It is a beautiful, grande finale to Jimi's most heartfelt album, and a testament to the man who created it.
0316172324|5.0|One of Rudyard Kipling's famous \\"Just So Stories\\" was about the Elephant's Child, an animal \\"filled with 'satiable curtiosity\\". Malcolm Gladwell is clearly something of an Elephant's Child himself and his curiosity leads him into exploration of an extraordinary range of interesting and useful phenomena. <br />His \\"The Tipping Point\\" was a tour de force on how epidemics, ideas and fashions propagate and what causes the sudden take-off that is characteristic of an epidemic - or a fad. From his findings, he drew out many conclusions that are directly useful to business, as well as being interesting in themselves. <br />\\"Blink\\" is that rare thing - a second book that is as good as the first. It looks at several related phenomena, particularly:  <br />* the power of first impressions and what we call intuition, why they are often right and what are the factors that can cause them to be systematically wrong; and <br /> * the related power of understanding the use of what he calls 'thin slices' (a limited number of very specific elements that are always present in complex situations or judgments) to improve judgment. <br />The book provides a systematic, fascinating and highly entertaining examination of these phenomena - how they manifest themselves, why they work as they do, why some people are much better than others at making sound judgments from apparently little evidence, what can be done to improve first impression judgments and, perhaps even more important, avoid being led astray by first impressions. It also demonstrates the extraordinary amount of detailed work that is necessary to identify consciously the tiny clues that our subconscious registers, so that they can be turned into useful tools for improving rapid judgment, and helps one to glimpse the awe-inspiring capacity for subtlety of the human brain. <br />One of the key messages for business is the power of our unconscious biases and how important it is to recognize that they exist and to take steps to minimize their impact. <br />A second key message of the book is the obverse of that: learn to trust your intuition and to cultivate it. Our subconscious is often better at detecting dissonance than are our analytical skills. <br />A third is that, out of the flood of data available by which we might judge a situation, only a few factors are truly influential (Pareto's Law applies here too). Effort put into identifying those factors and then learning to use them can bring great rewards. <br />Gladwell has in full measure the rare gift of helping readers to learn a great deal while enjoying themselves thoroughly.
B000002HRE|1.0|I think they are unhappy with the fact they have had writer's block since the black album, and no longer have anything of any signifigance to offer their fans of old. Yes, they have tons of new fans, but cannot really identify with them. The old fans were just like them and used Metallica's music to escape the realities of everyday life. And Justice For All was the turning point, because while Metallica began to make more adult commentary they backed it up with solid musicianship and challenging music that still had an edge to it. The follow up was their commercial break-through and I believe gave the band some delusions of grandeur, a feeling that what they had to say was more important than the music (also known as U2 syndrome). This deslusion was carried out in Load (the album preceeding this) and as these songs are a continuation of that album, follow along accordindly. Money sometimes corrupts a band in ways that cannot be redeemed, such as losing touch with the very reasons you got to where you are in the first place, and I truly believe this has happened to these guys. Yeah, they pretend to be the old fun loving guys when a camera is turned on, but when the tape recorders are turned on in studios, a cynical, jaded group of guys comes out. Their music is no longer exciting and emotional and it drives them deeper into a funk they have been in since the black album. This review is coming from someone who championed these guys when no one else wanted to know about them, and was a huge fan up to and including the Black Album, which as the time I felt was a misstep they would soon correct, and over the years, have learned to embrace as the last good album from a band who that just seems to be going through the motions with no emotions. This album (Reload) is a tiny step better than Load, but not by much. If you didn't like Load, you'll probably hate this too. If you did like Load, you probably will, and it's a fact that if you are fan of this drivel Metallica spewed out in the mid 90's, you probably wouldn't care much for the stuff from their glory days. I am just deeply saddened that Metallica, who had so much to offer in the beginning, have chosen not follow bands like Slayer and Anthrax, and evolve the sound they already have. They have chosen to change their sound completely and totally alienate the fans that put them on the map in the first place. Sad but true.

B00006L3S3|3.0|Of the post-Beatles output for 1973, this album does not rest comfortably against Harrison's LIVING IN THE MATERIAL WORLD, or Ringo Starr's RINGO in recording quality, or sheer quality of material. And even what is considered McCartney's best effort BAND ON THE RUN outshines this album a bit, but that's saying a lot, because at least with Lennon you can observe somewhat, what he thinks or believes, or what made him the person he was expressed through song. With that edge to it, I say it's better than BAND ON THE RUN on artistic merit. Otherwise, it's a pretty uneven album, with some truly shining moments, some retreads of earlier material, and a sometimes painful on the ears listening experience. And I'm not too old to hear rock and roll. The volumes at which I listen to albums would probably surprise you, but there is such a thing as recording standards, and sometimes things just aren't recorded well to the point of pain and discomfort!<br /><br />In the REMASTER, a review by (I think) Dave Marsh is provided from 1973 of the album. Marsh made the observation that most of the time Lennon convinced him that he was an egotistical phoney, among other things, but then he heard an insightful album such as this and called him a genius again. When I listen to the album, I believe Marsh should have stuck with his original assumption. That won't get me any votes at Amazon, but hear me out. Maybe it was because Lennon was a Libra, who are notorious for being fence-sitters. What I mean by that is, all the time they are busy weighing out the good and the bad of the world, and often illustrating that to as many people as possible what those things are, they rarely practise what they preach, on either side of that fence. They go full sail into each sunset, but never land on an island. Lennon was full of Give Peace A Chance, and that everyone should see it as an option, but so rarely exercised it when it came to character killing Paul McCartney or George Harrison (IMAGINE's How Do You Sleep, and the 1980 PLayboy Interview.) If someone does you harm, either physically or emotionally, the peaceful solution is to ignore them, to not react, to avoid all confrontation whatsoever. It's what Gandhi and King utilised, and changed history forever. Because what they realised is that the less you resist, the more it looks like your attacker is incredibly wrong for attacking you. And when the world is watching, it can make kicking England out of India, and bringing Civil Rights to millions of Black Americans, seem totally justified and the only logical step forward in a world that just seems bent on not having things that way. But when Paul McCartney makes subtle 'attacks' on you, or George Harrison mentions no one in his autobiography, not even you, attacking them with words and music seems not like giving any peace any chance.<br /><br />Maybe Lennon was just figuring this out by the time he reached 40. We'll never know, but it's nice to think he was on his way. Judging by Skywriting By Word of Mouth, he had a long way to go, and the Playboy Interview. But Milk and Honey and Double Fantasy suggest he started coming to grips with it, and stopped placating the public and their perception of him, which he entirely fueled, and rarely came across an interviewer who challenged his observations.<br /><br />As said, on MIND GAMES you have moments that I can see Marsh seeing as insightful. To me, insightful is a George Harrison album, there's just not that much depth on a Lennon album, and usually his mouth would undo any  sentiment he expressed in song. Particularly saying he couldn't write certain songs that McCartney would write (like Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da, or When I'm Sixty Four)because that's not what 'Lennon' was about. And then write something like 'One Day At A Time', which is so McCartney 'you're the honey and I'm the bee' in sentiment that I'm not sure if Lennon knew himself or McCartney better. Lyrically it's better than McCartney, because Lennon was gifted with words, but it still doesn't escape 'One Day At A Time' being just 'this side' of the McCartney that Lennon couldn't stand. The sound you make is muzak indeed.<br /><br />The songs on here that are truly worth the purchase are 'Out The Blue', 'Mind Games', 'Aisumasen'. They are Lennon when he's writing great material worthy of his public stature. And I don't know if anyone's noticed this, but on this album and the next, even though George Harrison is nowhere in sight, he's there in spirit, because a lot of Lennon's solo work utilised slide guitars in the way Harrison used them. 'Mind Games' wouldn't sound out of place on any George Harrison album, and WALLS AND BRIDGES has a good four or five songs that might as well have had Harrison playing the guitar parts. For all Lennon's criticisms of his former bandmate on the surface, there was a subconscious part that went out and bought all of Harrison's albums and listened carefully to how he played.<br /><br />I wish there were more songs like OUT THE BLUE on this album. The song is truly beautiful. And even though its recording quality is dire, 'Meat City' has some really interesting things going on in it. The Amazon review mentions 'Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except For Me and My Monkey' in context to this song, partly, whether realised or not, because it's basically that song anyway!  Re-hashing an older song into a newer guise, much like 'Steel & Glass' on 1974's WALLS AND BRIDGES is basically 'How Do You Sleep' and 'Working Class Hero' combined, is what Lennon starts doing on his mid-70's work. He had run out of ideas or inspiration. Like McCartney's 'Mamunia' sounding much like 'Rocky Raccoon' and 'Mother Nature's Son' once again. It's less likely to happen with Harrison, because you rarely got to hear his Beatles era songs when they were written anyway!!.<br /><br />I think I prefer 'Walls and Bridges' or 'Double Fantasy/Milk and Honey to this album called Mind Games.t still doesn't escape 'One Day At A Time' being just 'this side' of the McCartney that Lennon couldn't stand.

0553260111|2.0|Unfortunately, this is not the case.  I saw the movie first and figured that the book must be even better.  What I found is that the movie took the best parts of the book: some characters and a loss of memory.  That is where the similarities end.  The book has little of the excitement and intrigue of the movie.  Ludlum tries to have many characters with different plots and motives, but in the end I simply wanted to watch the movie.  I enjoy books and try to stay away from being so critical (I just want an enjoyable read), but for those who want CIA/multiple plots in thriller/action style book should read some of Tom Clany's earlier work. <br /> <br />Final View:  Ludlum had some great ideas and a few good characters, but that is really all it turned out to be.  He should have sold this idea to a more capable writer.  Watch the movie and use the book to keep tables level.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Nightwish has been around for eight years-with each album their style has changed-this is to be expected. With this album, Nightwish uses an orchestra in many of the tracks-it works out well. <br /> <br />1. Dark Chest of Wonders- They do something wonderful with the guitars.  This song is very uplifting, the choir and orchestra are introduced, and, of course, Tarja Turunen is singing in her usual way.  <br /> <br />2. Wish I Had An Angel-This song is very interesting to review.  First, Marco Hietala sings in this song-personally, I think he has a decent voice. There is also a steady beat in this song, not unlike a techno song you might hear.  <br /> <br />3. Nemo-In Europe, this was the first single, and this was a wise choice. This has an excellent chorus and it's also geared towards the radio.  <br /> <br />4. Planet Hell- Another song where Marco Hietala sings.  I like this song-it's very fast-paced.  The lyrics are astounding, and the guitar solo is pleasant, if not rather intimidating, almost,  to listen to.  <br /> <br />5. Creek Mary's Blood- This song is tricky to review.  This song is eight minutes long, and it is like getting a lesson on Native American history-in an interesting way.  The song itself is very sad, the instruments give the whole song a gloomy feel, except for the choruses.  Those are very lively.  <br /> <br />6. The Siren-This is probably my favourite song on this album.  It's a very catchy song, with nice violin parts. Definitely reminds me of someplace cool, like the Arctic Circle or something similar.  <br /> <br />7. Dead Gardens- This song is rather hard to describe, too. It's based heavily on electronics, but it's still a very good song.  The lyrics seemed to have been well written, as well.  <br /> <br />8. Romanticide- This is another standout on the album. The guitars are fabulous. The lyrics and the vocals (Marco and Tarja) are absolutely gorgeous.  Romanticide was an appropriate title for this song, too. <br /> <br />9. Ghost Love Score-Like many have said-this is like its own soundtrack. Ghost Love Score is an interesting song to listen to-it starts off rather happily, then it turns melancholy, then absolutely dismal, then hopeful, and then happy again.  The orchestra and choir were vital to this song-everyone who contributed to this song did an excellent job. <br /> <br />10. Kouleme Tekee Taiteilijan-If you couldn't guess, this song is in Finnish.  I don't know what she's saying, but the song is beautiful.  It's just Tarja and a cello.  It's also kind of fun to look in the CD insert and look at the Finnish words-it's something you should look at sometime.  <br /> <br />11. Higher then Hope-This song starts off slow, but it builds up, and the chorus, though still slow, is not soft at all. It's a sad song, almost-'Higher than hope my cure lies.'  <br /> <br />12. White Night Fantasy-When you take into consideration the fact that this is a bonus track, you stary to appreciate the song more.  Tarja sounds much younger on this song, but then you realise that she's supposed to. <br /> <br />13. Live to Tell the Tale- A faster paced song, definitely nice. <br /> <br />Nightwish is a very good band, all of the members contributed something to this album.  Hopefully Nightwish will become a bit more well known-they deserve it.
068987474X|4.0|I have a friend of mine who just totally swears by this book so on a lark, I borrowed it and read it. I wasn't looking to gain anything specific from it as I'm hapily coupled up but ended up enjoying it anyway.    Personally, I've never been a fan of how-to books, especially those that preach to our emotions and relationships with others. This one, however, was forgivable in that sense because it was so funny. Yes, it may have been \\"Sex and The City\\" which gave it its popularity but you need not meet the clods they sometimes did to be able to apply a few bits of this book.    Some of the advice you can get out of this book seems pretty obvious but then again, I think we all own a pretty basic concept of what's right and wrong in a relationship. This is where the funny bits come in. Just as the title suggests it'll force you a few times to admit (even if begrudgingly) things you could do different or better, only it'll make you do so in between laughs so it won't hurt as much. What you can learn from it, even if done in a very forward fashion, is not that life-altering or different from what this type of book has been preaching for years on end and can be resumed in a few key points you've surely heard before. So we shouldn't make excuses for the men in our lives? Ok. Point taken. Next...    So overall, I approached it not expecting to learn anything from it and true, I didn't learn that much but I can see why this book is a bestseller and has remained so for a while. It made me laugh and recall a few oafs with whom I crossed paths. So yes, worthwhile but don't expect it to change your life or anything.
B00008ADPF|3.0|If \\"Nickelback\\" tried to do new things with their music besides the same beats, same chords, with a different order and lyrics, then I would be happy to give them four stars. If they did something classic or legendary, then they would get a five star rating. \\"Long Road\\" faulters in sounding too similiar to older Nickelback albums. The boys continue to play it safe and do what they are comfortable with. What this results in is too many songs sounding exactly alike. While the music isn't lame and does have some power to it, on the other hand it's all been done before. They need to try and do something different. It might not be what they initially wanted, but it could help them from sounding so the same. <br /> <br />So the pros: If your a Nickelback fan, you get your typical rock sound with power and rhythm. With the lack of new rock CDs, \\"Long Road\\" is better than CDs like Simple Plan. <br /> <br />Cons: Sounds too much like the other Nickelback CDs. The guys need to explore some new territories.
B00000633U|5.0|In 1987, Richard Marx had become a big star in releasing his first album entitled simply, RICHARD MARX. In 1989, two years after the release of his first album, Richard Marx released his second album entitled, REPEAT OFFENDER, his best album by far. This is an album that I most certainly cannot get enough of, no matter how many times a day I play this one.    NOTHIN' YOU CAN DO ABOUT IT    The fourth single from the album. A great song to use to open up your sophmore album. This is one hard and heavy song.    SATISFIED    The first single from the album. This was Richard Marx's second #1 hit single, talking about not giving up your goals until you are satisfied. This is one of the songs where his voice is at its strongest.    ANGELIA    The third single from the album. This song is one of my favorites from the album. Richard actually come up with this song title when he was on a flight to Texas. The flight attendant's name was Angelia (pronounced as Angel Lee-a). He used the name for this title and just wrote down the lyrics to this amazing song.    TOO LATE TO SAY GOODBYE    The fifth single from the album. This is another great song, with an edgy beat and rock sound.    RIGHT HERE WAITING    The second single from the album. When I first heard this song, like five years ago, I was not crazy about it. I didn't even like it. But when I became one of Richard Marx's biggest fans, I grow to love this song very much. It ranks up there with his most biggest and cherished hits.    HEART ON THE LINE    A great song.    REAL WORLD    Not bad.    IF YOU DON'T WANT MY LOVE    I never turn off this song when it comes on.    THAT WAS LULU    Not bad.    WAIT FOR THE SUNRISE    Not bad.    CHILDREN OF THE NIGHT    The sixth & final single from the album. What inspired Richard to write and record this song was a shelter of kids who had severe problems in their lives, such as abuse from their parents. He just wrote the song and recorded it, with the help of some of the kids putting their backing vocals on the song. It was actually the first song, where Richard Marx's late father had composed the music. This song is another one of my favorites.        If you a Richard Marx fan and you loved his first album, then get out and buy this incredible follow-up to its worthy predecessor. And I mean run out and but a copy RIGHT NOW!
B000060P79|1.0|Awww, poor Simple Plan, they just went platnium, have numerous top ten hits, and have gotten consistant play on the radio. Do I feel their pain? <br /> <br />Riiiiggghhhtttt <br /> <br />All the tracks on this album sound similiar to each other. Same chords, same rhythms, same whiny lyrics. The only song I really kind of like is \\"Perfect\\". Other than that, it's the same crap over and over again. <br /> <br />Check out bands like \\"The Killers\\", \\"Rooney\\", \\"Breaking Benjamin\\", \\"Chevelle\\", and \\"The Kaiser Cheifs\\" for some good new music. Leave these guys and their talentless trash out to dry.
1400032717|4.0|This book is very unique - told from the viewpoint of an autistic teenager. Funny at times, sad at others, it is better than most books out there. Easy read.
B0007KTBIU|5.0|This DVD set has already made its debut in some countries in Europe, and a friend of mine told me that it does have the deleted song \\"If I Never Knew You\\" back in the movie! I personally love that song and can't wait to see it back where it belongs. Of course, if you don't want to see a new song in the movie and would rather just watch it the way it was in theaters, you have the option to do so. This should be a great DVD with awesome special features...I can't wait until May!
0553212443|5.0|The Scrooge <br />A Christmas carol by Charles Dickens <br /> <br />Even though this book is about Christmas it helped me out a lot. I would never want to end up like scrooge was. He wasn't a happy guy, nobody liked him. He didn't care for anybody. This book taught me not to be selfish. I would like to get visited by three ghosts. I would want to see my past, present, and future. I think everybody should read this book. You will feel different about life after you have read it. You learn not to be selfish and a scrooge to people. It is a great book, full of symbolism and important life lessons.  <br />I give it five stars
B00005LC1H|5.0|The real prize element of this collection is that it shows Cleese's side of the MONTY PYTHON team, as well as being a great show piece for  Connie Booth's writing skills. It is very evident that this body of work is culturally specific in it's overall sense of humour: Whilst it is clear that US audiences enjoy the series( and some most definitely do not), the things that are liked are different to the way a British audience will perceive the series. <br />There are three  seasons in this collection, not the two as usually stated. Three seasons, three discs... <br />The writing is incredibly precise. You can see this in the published versions of the scripts. In this respect, it has the same skilled basis for good performers as the Python Material. But where the Python team did not know where to stop, Cleese and Booth decided to leave it at three seasons, and so whilst there is a demand there for more of this material, Cleese and Booth wanted to leave on a high note. <br /> <br />It's incredibly hard to give a precise of each show, since the writers blocked out the story flows on charts over 6 week  periods, and basically agonized  over every word. These shows were done with an eye for precision, and in this respect they were an extension of the Python  process for writing, since each show ( FAWLTY TOWERS as well as seasons 1-3 of MONTY PYTHON) is an example of detailed work. <br /> <br />All this adds up to a body of work that stands up to repeated viewing, and has a degree of universality ( like YES MINISTER, and  YES  PRIME MINISTER, but the YES... MINISTER  series are much more  Universal). And I suspect that the writers and producers never expected this series to have the longevity it has attained ( Much the same way that Ben Elton has stated that THE YOUNG ONES is very clearly  dated, since it was targeted for specific  times and specific   events); however, FAWLTY TOWERS looks at some Universal  elements in life, and in  British  experience. <br />Undoubtedly,FAWLTY TOWERS is perennial, but it is mainly perennial for the British  experience; a US  audience will like it to some degree, but the appeal is fundamentally  different. It is not that it is less, just different. <br /> <br />All that Being said, I can recommend this collection as being a great body of work. As an example of low budget British TV comedy that has at its heart a Superb script, one can but hope that TV in general, in all places, irrespective of the budget, will look to great scripts, and let the story telling be augmented by great performers ( such as Cleese), each to their own milieu ( Cultural, or whatever), or even if aimed at a world audience. Key to the understanding of the cultural  specificity, is how Manuel changes from being Spanish in the original  series, and then in the Spanish, he is Italian, and in each different language dub, the Archetype selected for Manuel changes  according to how each dub version will select a different nationality to be the butt of the jokes... and the way these jokes are translated tell more about the culture they are being reworked into than they do about the original  version of the show. <br />At once a very simple show, but it can be seen on many levels; however, if you don't get it, if you don't find the shows funny, remember that these ARE shows done for a particular Milieu; a better example of more Universal comedy from the BBC, is something like YES MINISTER ( not to say that this higher budget work is better, simply different). <br /> <br />
B0001Z53AQ|3.0|I have to admit, the quality of this album actually shocked me. After hearing \\"devil's night\\" i thought that they were a 1 trick pony and they'd disappear. They just seemed more concerned with the whole shock factor rather than the skills factor to sell their records+i for one wasnt feeling it that much. This time round though they're like a whole new band, much wittier, tighter flows, funkier beats (not as dark), more humourous stories and i preferred it straight away. In particular KON ARTIS, SWIFT and KUNIVA come into their own on this and provide MOST of the highlights on the album. The way they interchange on one another lines+stories is hysterical in parts (\\"bitch\\" and \\"my band\\"). Overall im feeling this album much more than \\"devil's night\\" which i found very one-dimensional (take drugs+kill everybody).As i said before the beats are much funkier from EMINEM aswell as KON ARTIS (3 bangers!!) and the the obligatory KANYE WEST collabo \\"d-12 world\\". But the real standout cut for me is the RED SPYDA produced \\"leave that boy alone\\" which is an absolute soundbomb!! What impresses me most is that EMINEM doesnt appear on all the tracks and the rest of the crew rise to the challenge and in some cases outshine EM when he does appear on some tracks. The only negative thing i would say is that BIZARRE+PROOF dont raise their game to the same levels as the rest. I completely change my opinion about them, an excellent album!!
B000002UY3|5.0|I have to agree with J.Chadwick. <br /> <br />This entire CD is very melodic and groovy with a psychedelic feel to the songs.  I love how entrancing Hope Sandoval's voice is combined with the resonating chords on the guitar and keyboard.  I think of the 3 Mazzy Star CDs, this is my least favorite, but it is still very excellent.  I highly recommend \\"Among My Swan\\" and \\"So Tonight That I Might See,\\" which I play to wind down to after a long day, or as someone else mentioned...it's great for making out to!  Whenever I just want to chill out with a good drink, I usually put Mazzy Star, Pink Floyd, or The Doors in the CD player.
B000063DI9|5.0|Iron Maiden are nothing if not prolific in production; and while this album definitely shows Bruce Dickinson's vocals at their peak,  if you're looking to find songs that stand on their own, there are definitely other albums that contain better selections - \\"The Number of the Beast\\" and \\"Powerslave\\" would be my picks for the single songs on the album.   <br /> <br />However, as an album, there just isn't another in their that stays together as well as this one.  When I listened to this album time first time out, it sounded weak - with the reputation it had, I was expecting something driving and powerful, like Powerslave.  And it isn't that.  As others have said, it's certainly not QUITE what you'd expect from typical Iron Maiden - the drums and guitars seem quieter, though the guitarwork is still exquisite. <br /> <br />Every time after that very first, this album has totally blown me away - it may not be driving like Powerslave, but it's exquisitely constructed, and Dickinson's vocalwork is immaculate.  The whole thing really is incredible to listen to.  It's best heard from start to finish rather than one track at a time, though, as that's where it comes into its own. <br /> <br />If you want a few great songs to listen to on their own merit, don't pick up this one - go for The Number of The Beast, or Powerslave.  But if you want something to put on and listen to, to get lost in, pick this one up.  You won't regret it.
0786890754|5.0|In 'P.S. I Love You', Holly is coping with the death of her husband, Gerry.  From the flashbacks we read, they are a typical couple with the same little fights, annoyances, and happy events.  After suffering from headaches, Gerry soon learns he has a brain tumor and unfortunately passes away as a result.  Gerry and Holly had an ongoing joke that because Holly was a little dense when it came to certain things he would leave her a list in case anything happened to him.  A few months after his death, her mother reminds Holly that she received an envelope for Holly entitled \\"The List\\".  The List turns out to be a series of envelopes for different tasks and requests that Gerry wants her to carry out over several months.  There are several envelopes, each labeled for a particular month, and for which she cannot open until midnight of the said month.  For Holly, The List helps her reconnect and feel close to Gerry, but in the process it also helps her grieve and heal. <br /> <br />I loved this book, I really did.  It's a fast read, and when it ended, I was actually sad.  There were times I even found myself tearing up, I couldn't believe it.  I truly loved all of the characters.  Holly has a great group of people around her, from her eccentric family to her friends, particularly Sharon.  If only I had such good friends (I know, I know, it's a book).  At times Holly was a little snotty, but I suppose I can't expect her to be nice and congenial all the time considering the circumstances. <br /> <br />Quite a bit has been mentioned of the style of writing, i.e., young, amateurish, and at times, yes, the writing can be a little 'young' for lack of a better word.  But those moments are few and far between, and if you look beyond that, this is a truly wonderful book detailing a woman's struggle to move past the tragic loss of her husband and forge a new life for herself.  I will say that I was surprised that the book ended a little differently than I expected (not in a bad way).I plan on keeping this book and re-reading it in the future, which shows just how much I loved this book.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Finally a new band that really kicks ass. <br /> <br />Melodic, enthusiastic, daring, energetic, various, no computers. Although contains echos from the eighties, this band is spontaneous. <br /> <br />Buy!
B00008NG5V|5.0|Days can get pretty stressful people can get on your nerves, how can you chill out? I would recommend popping in a Jack Johnson CD. On and On maybe. Brushfire Fairytales was a great cd one you could chill out to all day. On and on, just the same. Sometimes it is good to take a break from electric distortion screaming vocals and just take a second listen to how beautiful a guitar can sound and enjoy the chill factor of this CD.  <br />Jack Johnson is probably one of the best guitarists I can think of. All of his albums are recorded in his basement in hawaii and he thinks up his melodies while surfing. He is so relaxed takes nothing for granted and it definaltly shows through his music. If you plan on buying a Jack Johnson CD don't buy just one buy them all they are all worth the dough.
B00001SIES|4.0|In my opinion, along with Radiohead the best band that started in the nineties.    While the group mixes a bunch of styles, it has an own particular sound. Being intense (not always very optimistic in sound) and mostly loud, they are sometimes even bombastic but get wonderfully away with that.    Mind you: Muse consists of only three musicians. Bellamy is a very talented and original composer, guitarplayer and singer.    Great debut album: recommended!
B00006LIRI|2.0|This is a dreadful compilation. This is not a 'Best Of'. I don't even need to talk about those shameful 'new mixes'. They just destroyed 3 songs of Pop and 1 song of Zooropa. As a R.E.M fan pointed out about R.E.M's 'In time: Best of': \\"And how did those new songs merit \\"great\\" status, anyway? I bought this CD in order to listen to songs that have already proved their weight, not to listen to anything new\\".     The truth is both 'Electrical Storm' and 'The Hands That Built America' were another hit and miss stuff of the worst U2 decade ever.     I just want to see out there their long-time rumored 'The Rest Of The Best'. My suggestions:    CD1: 1- Out Of Control, 2- The Electric Co, 3- Gloria, 4- I Threw a Brick Through a Window, 5- A Celebration, 6- Seconds, 7- Two Hearts Beat As One, 8- '40', 9- A Sort Of Homecoming, 10- MLK, 11- Bullet The Blue Sky, 12- Running To Stand Still, 13- In God's Country, 14- One Tree Hill, 15- God Part II, 16- Heartland    CD2: 1- Zoo Station, 2- The Fly, 3- Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses, 4- Acrobat, 5- Love Is Blindness, 6- Zooropa, 7- Numb (ORIGINAL), 8- Lemon, 9- Discothque (ORIGINAL), 10- Staring at the Sun (ORIGINAL), 11- Last Night on Earth (Single), 12- Mofo, 13- Please (Single), 14- Elevation, 15- Kite, 16- Walk On.    It's in your hands U2!.
B0002858YS|5.0|i thought that i will like this cd only for some time, i mean that after week or two it won't be so amazing for me as it was for the first time i heard it.After 2 months i still can listen to it over and over again and i feel like i love it even more!Flowers voice for me is just amazing!! And i can't really tell which song i like the most cuz the entire album is wonderful!
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 are selling out and playing what 16 years old kids want them to play. In other words, more ATYCLB stuff. Of course, those kids didn't live Achtung Baby times. Rather, they experienced ATYCLB times. They loved it, because they pretended to experience what we experienced back in 1987, 1991 or 1993. The same thing happen here.  <br /> <br />\\"It's a classic\\", \\"their third masterpiece\\", \\"best since Achtung Baby\\", etc. Those reviews sound like written by a bunch of 16-17 years old mainstream fans who just listen to the album once before writing their snapshot lines. But in the end, I do believe those reviews are written by U2's marketing team. Just go to the first 100 reviews. Most of them were 5 stars ones...mmmm... <br /> <br />U2 stopped releasing decent material with POP. Despite I'm not crazy for it ( I'd give it 4 stars ) at least they took worthy risks with that album. U2 are not worth paying any attention to anymore. They look more like GQ models than musicians. They don't sound unique anymore but merely a second rate \\"Rock\\" band. <br />  <br />Everything on this album sounds recycled. And when you're in the musical recycling business, you truly do not grow or mature. So many critics mistake stagnation for growth and maturity, particularly for this album. Quite simply, HTDAAB is not growth. It is their worst regression ever.

B00068IOWC|1.0|U2 are selling out and playing what 16 years old kids want them to play. In other words, more ATYCLB stuff. Of course, those kids didn't live Achtung Baby times. Rather, they experienced ATYCLB times. They loved it, because they pretended to experience what we experienced back in 1987, 1991 or 1993. The same thing happen here.  <br /> <br />\\"It's a classic\\", \\"their third masterpiece\\", \\"best since Achtung Baby\\", etc. Those reviews sound like written by a bunch of 16-17 years old mainstream fans who just listen to the album once before writing their snapshot lines. But in the end, I do believe those reviews are written by U2's marketing team. Just go to the first 100 reviews. Most of them were 5 stars ones...mmmm...  <br /> <br />U2 stopped releasing decent material with POP. Despite I'm not crazy for it ( I'd give it 4 stars ) at least they took worthy risks with that album. U2 are not worth paying any attention to anymore. They look more like GQ models than musicians. They don't sound unique anymore but merely a second rate \\"Rock\\" band.  <br /> <br />Everything on this album sounds recycled. And when you're in the musical recycling business, you truly do not grow or mature. So many critics mistake stagnation for growth and maturity, particularly for this album. Quite simply, HTDAAB is not growth. It is their worst regression ever. Stay away from this unless you are a die hard U2 and simply have to have just for the sake of having it, like those kids.  <br /> <br />U2 have become very rich and all of that money seems to have dulled their whole creative vein. I'm tired of listening to little teenybopper mainstreamers who listen to whatever MTV tells them to and not to what has quality tell me that U2 did not sell out.

B0002YLC24|5.0|-I am not typically into romance movies, but Before Sunset touched my heart. I am a great fan of Ethan Hawke and admire him for never taking bad roles....soo i was skeptical at first......buuut this movie (and nooo you don't have to see Before Sunrise before seeing this!!!) had a tremendous impact on me..........i was mesmerized and captivated almost immediately, proving the movie to be a work of art, as it is less than an hour and a half......what makes this movie unique and quite an experience is that it all takes place throughout one encounter, all 80 minutes of the movie are 80 consecutive minutes in the lives of these lovers.......i will not spoil the ending, but it was amazing to me to experience the agony of the possible seperation of the lovers, as it was inconceivable to see them being apart from one another for such a long period of time.....even though ethan hawke's character is now married with a child and julie delpy is in a relationship as well, you will find yourself not wanting the lovers' time together end so abruptly.......there are some desperate, frantic moments regarding their possible separation but the movie to me is a masterpiece with its romantic humor and especially for its fabulous, honest, and realistic dialogue...so real
B0006399FS|1.0|Like most of U2 fans, I must say that the downturn for U2 began with the sellout ATYCLB. It was a smash, but it was just hit and miss, unlike their 80s and 90s gems. U2 decided to take their music in an annoying sellout commercial way in order to sell records, after 2 amazing albums - extremely underrated and overlooked -.    Who wants to hear a band stay with the same style album after album? That's the question after listening to this \\"new\\" album HTDAAB. It's a torture for me as U2 fan, I mean, I remember being asked in 1997, when they released POP, by a close friend: \\"So what's the U2 style, mate?\\", \\"It's an expect the unexpected one, and I love it. With every album we're surprised\\"... can I say the same about this album? NO.    All the songs sound the same and the lyrics are straight up corny. No memorable songs here and just lacks passion throughout the entire album. The band claims they are growing musically, but all I see is that they are being brainwashed into believing that by the money and the ideas of the commercial music industry. Don't believe a word from these clowns because all they see now a days is the almighty dollar.  I believe drinking too much wine has killed most of their brain cells  Hang it up, or come up with a new name because you're not U2 anymore    U2 has become everything that they once claimed to have hated, and it really makes me sad.

B000002UAU|5.0|1966 and 1967 could be considered one of the first true \\"golden ages\\" for Rock Music.   This is one of the years where creativity really took off in the Rock world.  This creativity  was twofold:  1) Technology was improving and Studio Recoding techniques were becoming bettter - thus a better product was being produced; 2) The Times - with the state of society during this time period - Vietnam, etc was raising the bar on songwriting.   .   Artists such as Bob Dylan were beginning to emerge with some top notch work. In 1966, The Beach Boys would release an album called \\"Pet Sounds\\" that would raise the bar even higher.  This was largely the effort of Brian Wilson who would integrate the terrific harmonies of The Beach Boys with some complex and innovative instrumentation (flutes, whistles, harpsichords, organs, bells).   In December 1966, when The Beatles would go into the studio to record their album, there was little doubt that they were looking to continue to raise the bar even higher.   The result would be an album that would put now place The Beatles at the upper levels of creativity - that album being \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\".   The rest is history - \\"Sgt Pepper\\" would become one of the all-time great albums in music history. <br /> <br />Being that \\"Sgt Pepper\\" has taken its place among one of the great albums of all time, just about everything has been written about this collection.     From my personal standpoint, if you go back to 1967 - this album was cutting-edge.    Some people consider \\"Sgt Pepper\\" the album where The  Beatles started to expand their instrumentation.  However, many people forget that prior works had seen The Beatles use a wide range of instrumentation - especially on the \\"Revolver\\" album (they used Violins, Viola, Indian Instruments, French Horns, Trumpets, and Sitar). \\"Sgt Pepper\\" continues the trend on \\"Revolver\\" by working with this expanded instrumentation.   But this is where The Beatles would integrate the twofold creativity approach mentioned above - 1) Use of Technology:  The liner notes do a great job at explaining how microphones and oscillators were intricately placed to give the album a unique sound;  2) Songwriting - The liner notes also do a terrific job at pointing out how imaginative an effort \\"Sgt Pepper\\" was. <br /> <br />Here is my breakdown of each song: <br /> <br />\\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\":  I think the guitar work sometimes gets forgotten about behind the terrific French Horns in this song.   Great lead vocals by John and Paul.   This was primarily a McCartney penned song.  A McCartney trademark (especially in later music) has always been to use character names in songs - such as Sgt. Pepper and Billy Shears. <br /> <br />\\"With a Little Help From My Friends\\": One of the strongest songs on this collection.  I love how it segues from \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\".   This is Ringo's song - from the vocals and drums, he delivers a flawless performance.  John provides great background vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds\\": George's Sitar playing highlights this song - showing some of the Indian influence that George was interested in at the time. <br /> <br />\\"Getting Better\\":  Paul's vocals right on the money.  I think this is another song with underrated guitar work.  There are also some bongos by Ringo that give this a solid feel.   <br /> <br />\\"Fixing a Hole\\": Paul provides lead vocals with support from John and George.  I think the use of a Harpischord plays a key role in this song.  I also hear a slight Indian influence in this song. <br /> <br />\\"She's Leaving Home\\":  Another brilliant song from an instrumentation point of view.  Great use of Harp, Horns, and Strings in this song.  This is a powerful song (from a parents point of view) about a daughter who leaves home. <br /> <br />\\"For the Benefit of Mr. Kite\\": I know I said McCartney loved to use characters in songs, but he must have had some influence on Lennon (the primary songwriter) who coined the names \\"The Hendersons\\", \\"Mr Kite\\" and \\"Henry the Horse\\".  Great use of Calliope and Organs to give this a \\"Carnival Song\\". <br /> <br />\\"Within or WIthout You\\": This is the big Indian influenced song on the album - lots of Indian instrumentation.  Being this was George's interest, he takes lead vocals on this.  This is a most unusual song for a Rock album, yet nobody blinks an eye today that this is on a Beatles or Rock album.   <br /> <br />\\"When I'm Sixty Four\\": The use of the Clarinets give this song an \\"old time\\" feel - much in conjunction with the Sgt Pepper Band theme.  Paul adds some great piano work.  Perhaps the use of Bells here was influenced by \\"Pet Sounds\\". <br /> <br />\\"Lovely Rita\\": This is an underrated song.  John and Paul's harmonies are terrific.  You will also hear traces of Indian sounds - as well as some Honky Tonk piano by George Martin. <br /> <br />\\"Good Morning, Good Morning\\": More great harmonies with John and Paul.  Horns will highlight this song - French Horns and Saxophones.  There are also \\"animal sounds\\" -no doubt another influence by \\"Pet Sounds\\". <br /> <br />\\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band (Reprise)\\": For some reason I like the reprise better.  I think the use of the maracas and drums on this version sets the version apart from the 1st one. <br /> <br />\\"A Day in the Life\\": This is the true masterpiece.  One of the greatest songs put together by merging different song fragments.  The use of an Orchestra and the integration of a crescendo are well documented.  It's the perfect wrap-up song because it really sums up the high level of creativity in one song.  From a meaning standpoint, the lyrics can be dissected so many ways. <br /> <br />The liner notes provide all of the lyrics and give lots of background information about the making of \\"Sgt Pepper\\".   The only thing the liner notes are weak on is listing what instruments are in each song.  This album is pure masterpiece even by today's standards - Highly Recommended.

B0002ZDVEU|5.0|I highly recommend this movie as it's fast paced action. It's just as good, if not better, than the first. My only complaint - and given the type of film that it is I have to say it's a major complaint - is the camera angles during the fight scenes. The camera is zoomed way in during the fight scenes for a close up. This would normally not be a big deal if it was in slow motion but it isn't in slow motion. Imagine this, a bunch of close ups happening so fast that you can barely tell what in the world is going on and wouldn't know if it weren't for the story and the fight sounds happening. Everything else in the movie is great. Incidentally, they use the same sort of camera techniques during a car chase and it worked very well. If the director had done the fight scenes as normal you'd be looking at an A+ rating, as he didn't, B+ to A- at best.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|Following his very successful (3 million plus copies world wide) first self-titled cd this release establishes Buble as a guy with the work ethic and talent needed to succeed. <br />A visit to his fan sites and recent stories high light how determined and hardworking he is even though he was naturally gifted with a magnificent voice. I would dearly love to see him on Oprah soon. <br />To take the type of songs he has on this cd and reenergize them is a challenge he rose to with exceptional results - take a listen to You and I or you don't know me or the more I see you and you'll experience the Buble experience! <br />Nice to see a well spoken well mannered and highly regarded human being succeed.
0807205567|5.0|I have No Idea how I missed reading this fantastic book for so many years!<br /><br />If you like Robin McKinley or J.K. Rowling, you will like Sabriel, it is Better than The Hero and the Crown.<br /><br />Nix's fantasy world is detailed and wonderful, his characters are utterly sympathetic and cool, his writing is enchanting, and the plot, while it conform to the expected norms of young adult fantasy, contained plenty of surprises.<br /><br />(This is really only Young Adult fantasy in that it features Young People and doesn't have sexual content. Adults should read this, while the descriptions of the undead may make this book scary for very young readers.)<br /><br />I actually started listening to Sabriel on audiobook, which I highly recommend because Tim Curry does a magnificent job with the reading. Eventually, I couldn't handle just listening, so I had to get a text copy so I could read on lunch break.<br /><br />I am really looking forward to reading the next two books!
B0002TKFR2|5.0|I love the new medium of SACD and this one certainly didn't disappoint me. I thought that very confortable sound was one of the best things about his remastering. It is so very clear that the dynamics of SACD had been used when remastering this. I often think that CDs have an edgy sound, especially from a piano, that I just couldn't shake. This release has none of that edgy sound and everything sounds so natural and great.  <br /> <br />The performances itself are second to none. The two magnificent artists, Jascha Heifetz and Charles Munch, are great together. The Beethoven concerto is performed so much artistic finness. It is played quite fast. I am always in awe when hearing Heifetz at the apparent ease when playing an extremely difficult piece. The Mendelsohn concerto is even more remarkably played than the Beethoven. Again Heifetz is quite fast but always true to the piece. The end of first movement was especially exilerating.  <br />If you are a fan of Jascha Heifetz you should not miss the Naxos Historical release of Beethoven's Violin Concerto with he and Toscanini. That one is also quite remarkable, but quite different. <br />At this low price you really couldn't go wrong if you are looking for great performances of Beethoven's or Mendelsohn's Violin Concertos. I bought it even though I had the CD version and I was definitly not disappointed.

6304708521|2.0|I got my copy from raretshirts.  I'm glad I have a copy on DVD.  However, I was disappointed with the quality of the film.  It's much like others have said.  It is grainy, the color is washed out, and, in my opinion, it's just a transfer from a VHS copy. <br /> <br />The description that you read about the film gives you the impression that the behind-the-scenes material and newsreels will be on the DVD.  Not on this one!!  Because of that, I was really disappointed.  I probably would've given the DVD another star if those things were on there. <br /> <br />In my opinion, if these are the only copies floating out there currently, then get one.  But don't pay that much for it.  I think I paid too much for the one I got.

1400034779|5.0|A friend gave me this book for Christmas and like her I have now almost read the whole series.  The story is simple and an easy read but beyond that there is a depth of innocence and simplicity which almost has a smile behind it more often than not.  Alexander McCall Smith's writing reminds me a little of Rudyard Kipling's writing in \\"Just So Stories\\".  I find myself sometimes just wanting to read it out loud for the effects of the writing.  The story is joyful, positive and interesting, not only from the point of view of the many crimes that Precious Ramotswe has to solve but in how it follows her life, her intuition and her traditional Botswana ways.  The innocence and honesty of the characters takes me back to some of Laurens Van Der Post's writing and that echo for me is also a very positive one.
B000002LND|2.0|And let me tell you why. Most all of these songs are not the original versions. Many have been remixed ( read the liner notes, you'll see Shep Pettibone credited ), and  many have been shortened. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. In the case of the later hits Express Yourself and Like a Prayer, I actually prefer the remixed \\"house\\" style versions remixed here by Pettibone. In the case of the earlier hits, it's butchery, plain and simple. Into the Groove is a travesty, a remixed shell of the orginal. It sounds sped up, and barely gets to the \\"now I know you're mine\\" part ( my favourite part, no less ) before the plug is pulled and we are on to the next hit. Holiday, Lucky Star and Borderline get the same treatment also. And that's just the singles that ARE here. SO MUCH is missing, so many hits, major and minor,like Dress You Up, that are not included. This could have ( and indeed SHOULD have ) been a two-disc set, with all the original hits, intact,  as they were released. As it is, it is a perfectly acceptable, if economical and flawed, introduction to Madonna's early hits. What this woman needs is a box set. Plain and simple.
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I've read some reviews, and frankly I'm disappointed by some of these opinions. First off, Saw was brilliantly well done. I think this is one of those films that's too clever for it's own good(Just like \\"Back To The Future II\\"). <br />   The movie begins with an abrupt introduction to two men held captive in a room in \\"God knows where\\". There is Dr. Lawrence(Cary Elwes), and Adam(Leigh Whannell). For whatever reason everyone seems to be complaining an awful lot about Leigh Whannell's acting, or the entire cast's acting in general. I wouldn't call it great, but I also wouldn't go as far as calling it \\"B-Rated\\". For his first acting gig, Leigh Whannell actually did a good job, and he had some really funny lines to boot: \\"All I know is that I fell asleep in my s**thole apartment, and I woke up in an actual s**thole\\". If anyone deserves the credit of being a bad actor, it would be Monica Potter, who unconvincingly plays an angry, oversuspecting wife to Dr. Lawrence. She literally has one signifigant line in the movie, and plays it off poorly. <br />   The plot, however, was brilliant, but even brilliance has it's flaws(Face it, you know you have a favorite movie of all time, and I'm sure you can point out it's flaws that you choose to overlook because the movie is so damn good.) The flaws are few and far between, but can easily be overlooked thanks to all the twists and turns that this movie takes. But nothing could prepare me for the ultimate final twist. The build up to that very twist makes my heart pump so hard, I can feel the pulses in my chest.  <br />   All in all, the movie isn't in your face scary, but it may strike your \\"fear of the unknown\\" to kick in. All you know is that something sadistic is taking place on screen, and you can do nothing but let the pieces slowly but surely fall into place.  <br />   This movie's biggest flaw is that it may be to smart for it's own good, and I'm sorry but when it comes to this film: WOW!!! <br /> <br />    <br />    <br/>
0345446798|5.0|Patricia is an excellent animal behaviorist and I recommend all her books. This one is the best one yet.<br /><br />Trisha is not a dog trainer--she is an animal behaviorist, this is what makes all the difference! Think of an animal behaviorist as a \\"root-cause\\" analyzer of behavior. Training only helps to train the pet to do a certain action but it does not get at the root cause of the response or behavior (like inadvertantly rewarding the behavior, you would be amazed at how many of us do this).<br /><br />One of my dogs has had dog training with Dogs Best Friend and they have the kindest and most dog-friendly ways of teaching!! Patricia's dog training classes teaches us that 99.9% of dog training consists of training the human, not the dog. Patricia teachs us how although we may be animals, the messages we send to our best friends are much different. For example, we may smile at our dog or attempt to hug it, but in dog language that is an act of aggression! In this book she tries to teach us how to behave more like dogs, and less like people (however crazy that sounds). One thing I remember from Dogs Best Friend training was a trainer whom had a family pet as a child who only responded to \\"sit, sit, sit, sit.\\" It would not answer to just the command \\"sit.\\" Patricia teaches us the value of the 1-word command, and the usage of positive, rewards-based training. This book is more than just a training book it provides valuable insight into the way dogs think. You will be amazed at how much your pet can learn when you start speaking their language! This book teaches us to think about how we are behaving in front of our dogs, and how important it is to \\"Be the leader of the pack, A benevolent leader,\\" as she would say.<br /><br />Any dog lover is at a loss without this book. For more on Trisha, those of you whom can tune in to Wisconsin Public Radio, Saturdays Trisha hosts a program called \\"Calling all Pets\\" which answers pet related problems.

0440224764|1.0|Read this book to get a feel for what nearly every other Grisham novel is like.  This is a novel about a big pot of money, and characters who have no souls who are chasing it around.  You won't care about the relationships--this is about dreaming what it would be like to have millions of dollars.  A lotto ticket might be a better investment.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the end except to say that it ends like all other Grisham books:  it won't make much sense, it will be \\"ironic\\" in the sense that suddenly characters behave completely differently than you would have expected, and it is a \\"twist\\" in the sense that the author has been holding out on you and then suddenly reveals a fact you should have known all along.  And, of course, it is about the money anyway.  I turned the last page realizing I didn't really care about anybody in this book, I just felt, for a little while, that I was going along for a 90 million dollar ride.
B0002X314C|1.0|After hearing about this album everywhere, not only did I buy one for myself, but many of my friends. The beat and music is good, but the lyrics are a bummer! More than half the songs are about cheating or leaving a girlfriend. Now I have to call my friends and apologize for sending it to them.
B0001DI0FI|5.0|It's a rare thing to combine truly exciting action with characters one can feel deeply about. And we get both in this film. Despite a rather simple plot, this allows ample room to develop the characters, relationships, and allows a glimpse into 19th Century Naval life for the audience. It is a truly rewarding formula. <br />I held my breath so often in anticipation, shed so many tears (I *sobbed* at one point), and felt so much for these characters throughout the entirety of the film, that I might as well have been acquainted with them for years. <br />The acting is all around, hands-down superb, and with such a fantastic cast, it makes this triumph even more complete.  <br /> <br />This is what adaptation is all about. Weir takes all the great elements from O'Brien's fantastic novels (no less than three, by my count) and seamlessly creates a rousing story one delights in immersing himself in. <br />The resulting script is even and satisfying, the effects stupendous, the music gorgeous, the costumes absolutely meticulous. <br /> <br />From its slow opening, the film's momentum very quickly picks up. A film ultimately about friendship and loyalty (on different levels), one should prepare for excitement, surprises (since we're aboard the HMS Surprise, this is fitting!), shocks, and thrills. <br /> <br />The DVD extras in this edition are great. (The extra map of S. America and behind-the-scenes booklette is very nice, too) <br /> <br />I only wish there were a director's commentary on the feature - it would have rounded out the extras nicely. Nonetheless, this beautiful 2-disc collector's set is well worth your money! <br /> <br />A worthy, worthy viewing. Splendid. I can't find a single thing I didn't like in it.

0754014975|4.0|I expected to hate the Australia book because of Bryson's general \\"I'm so funny\\" tone and my own disdain (unfortunately) for the majority of Australians I have met (no offense, Aussies, this is just my limited experience; most would share my disdain if they were trapped on a tour bus of \\"fun loving\\" (read: loud, crass and perpetually drunk) Aussies for a solid month). This book, though, looked at the subject, the history and landscape through a unique lens and was a rewarding read.  <br /> <br />It occurs to me that Bryson is more in his depth/element in Australia or America, while his observations on Europe often read like deeply biased American obtuseness and insensitivity. Bryson's wit here, in Australia, and his own seemingly inexhaustible curiosity and apt descriptions of Australia as an amazing, far off, awe-inspiring land we in the rest of the world never see, hear of, or think about are all endearing.  <br /> <br />Having never traveled to Australia, I am more tempted to do so after reading this book. To illustrate how little the rest of the world knows-I point out that in all my own travels/experiences, I have been to New Zealand but am always asked when I get back, \\"How was Australia?\\" as if the two countries are one and the same.  <br />
B00076ZZ9I|4.0|A number of reviewers seem to miss the point of the DVD aspect of DualDiscs here.  Essentially, this is an album released as a CD on one side (though not up to blue book standards) and a DVD-Audio of sorts on the other.  The purpose of the DVD side, like DVD-Audio discs, is not so much to include added value content (i.e. music videos, interviews, etc.) to the album, but rather use DVD's supperior audio capabilities to showcase the integrity of the original album master.  As such, this disc succeeds admirably.  The LPCM stereo tracks are far supperior to the CD version on the flip side.  A classic album given a much-deserved pollish.  Oh yeah, and there's an interview/performance video segment.

B000067FP7|5.0|It follows a somewhat conventional monster movie plot. An ordinary guy witnesses his unusual but cute cuddly pet spawn a horde of evil Gremlins. He tries to warn the authorities, but they don't believe him until the creatures show up and go on a rampage throughout the town. Like in many monster movies, a plan is devised to destroy them, which works, but then there's still one left which needs to be defeated.  <br /> <br />Every monster movie convention in the book is used, including all the famous shocks such as something jumping out in the foreground and something jumping out in the background, but what makes this film original is the Gremlins' silly personalities. They don't eat people or kill them in order to survive in any way. They just want to have fun and cause chaos! Their personalities are almost human and seem to represent a side of us that has no morals and just wants to let loose in a world without regulations. At times, you are cheering for the monsters, which makes this movie so unique. <br /> <br />Two major highlights are the bar scene and the movie theater scene where all the gremlins gather together and have a great time!  <br />
0393035158|5.0|\\"The End of Faith\\" is a book that holds the reader's attention from the beginning to the end. From the first sentences about a suicide bomber following his religious beliefs to the extremes, to the last sentences about the need to free humankind from its most dangerous myths and taboos, Sam Harris succeeds in dealing with the complex and controversial issues of the rise of irrationality and of public immorality when exclusivistic religions compete with one another. <br /> <br />Since most religions refuse tolerance and religious diversity, they are, ipso facto, profoundly at odds with the democratic ideals of individual freedom and of responsible secular governments. It is very difficult for democracy to survive in a climate of religious monopoly. That is the fundamental reason why so many Islamic countries have difficulty embracing democracy. <br /> <br />In Chapter 4, (\\"The Problem with Islam\\"), the author gives the answer: \\"The only future devout Muslims can envisage... is one in which all the infidels have been converted to Islam, subjugated or killed.\\" (p.110). Of course, with such a reductive vision of the world, there cannot be democracy and a right to dissent and to oppose. The search for unanimity is the rule and the ultimate result is the establishment of a dictatorial theocracy. <br /> <br />Western populations did live under some forms of theocratic Christendom for centuries. Nobody pretends that medieval Europe was democratic. However, the advent of the Renaissance and of the Enlightenment, and the gradual and sometimes violent removal of organized religion from public life (Ex.: The French Revolution of 1789) made it possible for democracy to take hold.  <br /> <br />The only criticism that can be levied at this interesting book is the scant mention of the anti-democratic bases of most religions. The author compensates, however, by multiplying the instances where religions have fostered human conflicts and violence between people. \\"The End of Faith\\", the author's first book, is a most valuable contribution to the debate about religion and violence. Mission well accomplished. <br /> <br />
0062502182|5.0|I reread this book often and I give it as a gift to like-minded friends.  It's not for everyone.  If you view life as a journey; if you are introspective; if you seek continuous self-improvement, then you will find a soulmate in Santiago, the hero of this book.  For the very practical and pragmatic, this little story may seem fluffy.  But for those of us who are dreamers AND doers, Coelho speaks directly to the soul.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|My opinion isn't in flow with much of the popular opinion posted, but I really enjoyed this release. I liked that there weren't any extras in the DVD and enjoyed just being able to sit back and watch the episodes one at a time. The story lines were great and although there are some that I like more than others, this show really has lived up to my expectations. I was afraid(being as young as I was when this first came out) that when I watched it again, it would be disappointing, but I was pleasantly surprised. It has been just as good as I remembered, and I am really looking forward to the releases of the next seasons. MacGyver's character, is the polite, and humorous entertainment I have been looking for. I would recommend this to anyone!
0783225857|5.0|The movie To Kill A Mockingbird, like the book, transports one to an ideal childhood with a perfect parent. I loved the experience of entering that ideal family's world, especially the vivid atmosphere of the children's daily life in their town and era, and the subtle ways the children are led to discover the truth about some of their mysterious neighbors. <br /> <br />At the end the way the viewer, through the children's eyes, himself discovers such a truth and experiences with them a moment of revelation--the sort of unforgettably meaningful moment that is a milestone in the road to growing up--drives home the theme: it is wrong to pre-judge, it is just to defend the innocent \\"mockingbirds\\" of the human race. The bending of rules at the end to protect one such mockingbird is utterly right and is justice; finally, a good, even heroic, act is rewarded. <br /> <br />It is to me a nearly perfect film adaptation, capturing the book's mood and spirit and meaning exactly. I only wish that the movie could have been a 1962 miniseries (there were none then) so it could have had every scene from the book. I never wanted the book to end. <br /> <br />My one small complaint about the film is that the courtroom scenes are presented a bit too much like a filmed stage play or a TV drama of the time, not as vividly realistic in its direction as the rest of the film. The actors playing the Ewells are also not up to the level of the other actors, reducing the quality and believability of the courtroom scenes.
0380713802|3.0|I've read a number of Bryson's books and this is by far the weakest one in my opinion. It's not terrible, but Bryson seems to be traveling just for the sake of crossing cities off of his to-visit list. He has a great writing style, but he seems to have very few really intriguing experiences and spends so little time interacting with the locals that you wonder why he bothers leaving home. If you want a more entertaining and informative story about traveling in Western Europe, consider reading my book, \\"Searching for the Holy Grail: My Travels in Western Europe.\\"
B00005JNPZ|4.0|I went to see this movie last Sunday, it was a dreary, nasty day outside and we decided to brave the elements and walk the 4 blocks to the theater. It was totally worth it. Will Smith is great, as is Kevin James and Eva Mendes. There were several other unknowns who did a great job. I love the \\"rich heiress who has a heart\\" - she was so not what you would expect from a Paris Hilton-type. I highly recommend this if you're looking for a light-hearted easy laugh. And yes...it is a good date movie!
B0002SROT0|4.0|There are all sorts of \\"red flags\\" that go up when you approach an album such as FROM A BASEMENT ON THE HILL.  We have a musical genius who has a long history of drug abuse and mental illness who is not signed to any major label making recordings in his own private studio.  This genius dies under mysterious circumstances (some say murder-most say suicide) and friends and family assemble various tapes left behind into a final album.  In other words, the album in hand is probably not what he would have put together himself.<br /><br />Truth be known, there are more of these guys \\"out there\\" than one would guess.  I would venture to say almost every burg has one; major cities having several.  Elliott Smith was an exception in that he actually had several albums out there that actually had some national distribution.  It also doesn't hurt that Smith was featured prominently on the GOOD WILL HUNTING soundtrack.  Smith is commonly said to dabble in Beatlesque melodies-but to my ears he had more than a few Simon & Garfunkel influences as well.<br /><br />First as few words about Smith's fabled suffering from depression.  Depression is said to be the common cold of mental illness.  It has been variously described in such unfriendly terms as \\"selfish\\", \\"at bottom just feeling sorry for oneself\\" and \\"anger turned inward\\".  While most will readily concede that depression is a mental illness, there is also this perception that there is an element of choice and self-indulgence in the matter.  People who hold this viewpoint tend to be firm in their convictions and you will even find a few former depressives who will agree.  But this is a confusion of cause with effects.<br /><br />Depressives are self-involved because they suffer-not the only way around.  Depression has been diagnosed as involving a chemical imbalance in the brain and a failure to achieve adequate phenolic amine neurotransmitter levels across the synapses.  Whether this gets at the bottom of the mental illness is still an open question.  What is generally not appreciated is that the depressive perceives reality differently.  The anguish and sadness the depressive feels in daily life is real and is carried around in everyday life much like shrapnel in a war veteran.  Much like embedded jagged piece of metal in the flesh, some days it is tolerable-other days the pain is so bad one can think of little else.  This changes how everything appears.  One of the more frightening aspects in the life of a depressive is that he tries to behave and react normally with others only to have those in daily life erupting in indignation and anger.  Depressives often withdraw or are paralyzed into inaction because the reactions of others are unpredictable and beyond control.  The depressive thinks he is acting appropiately and on a civil level; but the reality is he is abrupt and abrassive and unpleasant to be around.  Those living normal lives only have so much patience for depressives.  It is not that most people are unwilling to understand--they can't understand.  Real depression is so remote from normal human experience that you might as well be talking about another planet elsewhere in the great expanse of the Milky Way.  On a general level, depressives become self-involved because they are constantly trying to account for (at least to themselves if no one else) why \\"nothing works\\" and \\"why they are different\\".<br /><br />One of the worst things that can happen to a depressive is when it is revealed to him that he cannot even enjoy events designed to \\"have a good time\\".  The anguish and pain follow him everywhere and the depressive is incapable of setting it aside even for a short period of time.  It is not that he won't-he can't.  This effects even the depressive's most intimate friendships and family interactions.  Messages of support and love from others simply aren't \\"heard\\".  Assurances of \\"I love you\\" or \\"I wish I could do something for you\\"-the depressive hears the \\"words\\" but theycome across as empty and without depth.  These words said with the best intentions don't touch the world the depressive finds himself in.<br /><br />So when a depressive speaks he speaks of what he knows.  What he knows is that dark world filled with disappointments, sadness, anguish that can suck all the air out of the room-and a kind of beauty.<br /><br />This is perhaps the hardest for people who have never suffered a mental illness to understand.  Such is the strength of the human spirit that even in the worst of circumstances we all can see beauty and we try describing it to others.  No matter how much we maintain that the depressive lives in a world of illusion, he firmly responds that what is happening to him is real and a part of the human experience.<br /><br />Thus we have this marvelous CD from Elliott Smith that stands as testimony to an artist's certainty that no matter how individual and alienated his experience may have been something can be communicated to reveal real human emotions and a transcendent facet of splendor.<br /><br />Elliott Smith obviously had an exceptional gift to master the technical aspects of his craft and the physical agility to draw all the aspects of record making together.  It is surprising that a single artist can produce a mix as good as this with just a bunch of home equipment.  The best songs here are \\"Coast to Coast\\", \\"Pretty (Ugly Before)\\", \\"A Fond Farwell\\", and \\"A Passing Feeling\\".  While brief sketches of Smith's lyrics are included as a small booklet in the CD's gatefold, it seems to me that Smith was trying to communicate impressionistically rather than in a literal straightforward fashion.  I highly recommend that you listen to this CD with headphones as there is a lot going on sonically that you are liable to miss using a regular sound system.<br /><br />It is difficult not to listen to this album without thinking about Smith's imminent death.  But this is not an album that will fill you with angst and dread.  It is ultimately uplifting and sweet.but they come across as empty and without depth.

0743454529|3.0|WARNING: While the plot twists are not revealed in this review, they are alluded to.  <br /> <br />I deducted two stars as follows: <br /> <br />First deducted star: The writing in the second half/two-thirds of the novel was less careful and less imaginative that the first part. I almost got the impression the first few (beautiful) chapters were written to sell the novel and the rest was fashioned together hastily to meet a deadline. Creative and captivating prose gave way to trite personal observations and stunted conversations.  <br /> <br />For example: Page 54. Anna describes being slapped by for implying that her mother pays more attention to the older daughter with leukemia than she does to Anna. She states: \\"She leaves a print that stains me long after it's faded. Just so you know: shame is five-fingered.\\" Great imagery. But, later, on page 334. The hospital psychiatrist is testifying and is asked if he told the family to gentically engineer a child for the benefit of the daughter with leukemia. \\"'Absolutely not,' Chance says, affronted.\\" Really, do we need the tag line to tell us the doctor is affronted by the question? This sort of lazy writing fills the second half. There are too many words spent telling us how we are supposed to interpret the events instead of letting us make our own conclusions. <br /> <br /> <br />Second deducted star: (And maybe I should deduct one-and-a-half for this.) THE ENDING! (The half star for its medical inaccuracies, which I suppose I can forgive. It's hard not to notice these when you work in a hospital and \\"know\\" how these things really work.)  <br /> <br />Okay, Picoult could have accomplished the same \\"symbolism\\" other reviewers claim she was going for without resorting to such a cheap cop-out ending. Yes, I agree, there is a point to what she does other than to simply shock ther reader and sensationalize the story. BUT she spent four hundred pages preparing us to say good-bye to one of the characters only to spend five pages saying good-bye to another. I felt cheated and I cannot shake the feeling that the sense of loss I felt at the end was not for the characters but for the emotional energy I expending reading the novel. I am not bitter about what happens--I have read many surprising and heart-breaking stories--but the way she accomplished her goals smacked me as cold-hearted, unresolved in the end anyway, and a quick way to end a novel that was becoming too long. <br /> <br />That said, it is no easy feat to engage me emotionally in a novel in the first place, and Picoult, through her effective characterization, effectively wrapped me up in the story early on. This is the first novel I have read by her, and I had planned to read more almost as soon as I picked this one up. Perhaps, after I can forgive her for what she did in this one, I still might read another.  <br /> <br />I hope she is more careful with her prose in future novels, growing on her obvious talent with words and characters. I also hope she continues to tackle controversial and important topics that could and do affect us. Overall, this is a worthwhile story to read; I just had much higher expectations for it.
B00005JNPZ|5.0|I must admit I was scared when the opening scene was a dialogue by Will Smith directly into the camera.  I thought this was going to be another narrator movie and thoughts of regret started to pass through my mind.  Luckily it didn't last but a few minutes.<br /><br />The movie can be summed up as a movie about the not so perfect guy getting a shot at the unapproachable woman thanks to the help of professional dating consultant.  (I see an opportunity for a new professional industry.)  I found myself laughing outloud in the theater at several times and left the theater really happy and upbeat.<br /><br />There are definitely some silly scenes, scenes that aren't realistic, and some scenes that are so true to life that it hits you square in the eyes.  This is a story that is meant to be comical.  Meant to be outrageous and meant to be a little bit of wishful thinking--wishing a society good truly be accepting, open, good-willed, and open to love.<br /><br />While the ending is a little bit of an after school special (the message that 'Hitch' did nothing) it stays with the comedy and style of the movie without being corny.<br /><br />One of the best movies I have scene since 50 First Dates.
0385510454|4.0|Finally, a new Grisham page turner. A great premise, a fast pace, and beautiful descriptions. The character development was done quite well, and the hook comes early in the plot.<br /><br />What's with all of the concern about Grisham's many references to the sights, sounds and smells of Italy? Personally, I felt it added much to the reading experience. With the heart of the story taking place in Italy, the details were very much needed. It gives you a reason to put yourself in Backman's shoes, to see what he sees, hear what he hears, etc. It gives you the chance to feel as unfamiliar as he does in Bologna, every sight, sound, and feeling a learning experience.<br /><br />The end seemed a little anticlimactic, but that can happen when the rest of the rising action is at such a high level. Nevertheless, a great page turner, a quick and exciting read, and Grisham's return to form.
B00076ZZ9I|5.0|..immortal words from the classic track \\"Hells Bells\\". You find this song on this record, which is totally covered in black. After the tragic death of former frontman Bon Scott (R.I.P.) the AC/DC-boys recorded the tribute to the late Scott with Ex-Geordie singer Brian Johnson, and---made a classic. \\"Back in Black\\" should be owned by anyone who calls himself a rocker or headbanger. The Dual Disc version is very good and if one hasn't got a copy of this influential record, he should quick order this masterpiece.
B000683VI4|4.0|The Notebook is a great movie for the type of movie it is supposed to be. A young couple falls in love and the rest is pretty predictable. It has a type of Romeo and Juliet theme where the girl is from a wealthy family that looks down on the poor while the innocent boy works hard to get by. The girl's parents do not want them to see each other and eventually separate them.  <br />This movie is definitely a tear jerker. At times your eyes fill with tears because the onscreen love is strongly felt, they are incredible young actors. You may notice the actress is the same from the teenage movie \\"Mean Girls\\" (the snotty rich blonde), but she does an amazing job switching from teen drama queen to play in an adult love affair.  <br />I recommend this movie to those who enjoy a good love story, but not to those that complain of movies being too cliche. The film lacks the fifth star because of the dialouge which at times is random and unclear.
B0006IIKS0|5.0|This is a really cool flick! The documentary is honest to the bone and it gives you a look behind the scenes. The bonus features are quite interesting and the movie really shows why \\"st.anger\\" actually sounds what it sounds like! I think it is very courageous to produce such a movie and it is worth every single buck!
B00005JN0T|4.0|I'm not the type that enjoys SciFi movies and I actually didn't want to see I, Robot despite Will Smith having the leading role. However, I was proved wrong. I loved I, Robot. Even if you don't like action scenes and things that can't really happen type movies this is still very entertaining. <br />The plot is very good, and it proves what could happen if we take technology too far. We all wonder about what could happen in the future and what it will look like, I, Robot is a good depiction of what it might look like a few decades from now.  <br />Will Smith is awesome as always, and the robots were pretty well thought out.  <br />One scene in particular when the robots jump out at his car in the tunnel seemed a bit exaggerated but besides that the movie is very good. I recommend this on DVD to watch as technology progresses to compare later on what we think the future will look like.
B00006GFAB|5.0|A very good and quite complete collection of classic-rockers like \\"Love Gun\\" or \\"Strutter\\". Of course some very cool songs are missing on this record, but it gives a good overview of the long years that KISS are rocking the world. \\"The Very Best Of\\" is also very recommendable for Kiss-Newbies and for every Rocker who just wants to throw in a disc and enjoy without ANY filler-songs!
B00005JMEW|1.0|I understand that many people love Quentin Tarantino's work. However, I do not see it at all. Kill Bill was plain stupid. The movie was interesting in the beginning where the chicks fight but it gets old. The movie turns into a cartoon which I do not understand at all. Did they not have enough money to preform these actual stunts so they drew them up? <br />I understand the story of getting revenge since she was left for dead on her wedding day but it was not enough to keep my attention. <br />Kill Bill left me wanting her to kill me so the movie could finally be over with. If you are a Tarantino fan then most likely this movie will be for you. I don't like lots of pointless action scenes, they don't impress me.  <br />
0060989157|5.0|\\"The Dirt\\" is one of my most favourite rock-books. The Cre gives you a detailed insight in the world of sex,drugs and rock n roll! Sometimes the book is just cool, sometimes it is really funny and sommetimes it is really sad/tragic. It is very well written and should be read by anyone who wants to be a rock star!
1559408855|4.0|After reading alot about this movie on the net and from freinds i bought the Bfi's release of this movie, and to be completely honest, this isnt a film your going to have nightmares about. The concept of the film and the story line is obviously quite grim, but visually, its not that bad, compared to modern films like 7even, Saw etc this is nothing near as disturbing, many of the scenes are zoomed out and very short, i also failed to relate to the victims in this movie, as no time is spent on them and so could not appreciate the suffering they are supposed to suffer, which is think is what makes movies more extreme, along the lines of the way house of 1000 corpses does. The violent ending only shows momentarial glimpses of what is taking place. Aside from so many over exadgerations, this is an excellent movie, directed beutifully, and with a strong deeper meaning. If your looking for something sick and gory, get Saw, Ichi The Killer, Cannibal Holocaust, this movie was obviously strong at the time, but has lost alot of its Shock Value, none the less a great movie
