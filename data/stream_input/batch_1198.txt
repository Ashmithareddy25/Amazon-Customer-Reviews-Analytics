0545265355|4.0|I really enjoyed this series. There are a few over used YA tropes in these books, but the characters and the writing make it easy to forget you have seen the basic story before.<br /><br />With each book, my reading time got faster. I finished The Hunger Games over several days, but I finished Mockingjay in about 5 hours. My only complaint is the story of Katniss, Peeta, and Gale ended in three books. I would love to spend more time with these characters.<br /><br />Whether you are a kid or an adult do not miss these books. They are well written, and the story is extremely enjoyable.

1594744769|4.0|I was a little dissapointed when I started to realize that this book wasn't as \\"supernatural\\" as I thought. I thought it was going to be more of a ghost story. But it was still a very good book and there were several times that I had trouble putting it down. I have definitely recommended it to friends.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|I fell in love with this movie when I saw it in the theatre.  I knew it was one I wanted to own.  I'm so glad I bought it.  Diane Ladd is wonderful in every movie I've ever seen her in.  My all-time favorite of her movies is Lonesome Dove.  I've watched that movie 100 times and never tire of watching it.    The service was good.  Movie was delivered on time and in good shape.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|I held off from writing a review, as I wanted to give myself a month so I'd have some time to process what's gone so wrong with this series.<br /><br />Martin has fun with killing off characters, and in some circumstances that's an interesting tactic, but he's killed off all the charismatic ones: Tywin Lannister, Ned and Robb Stark, the list goes on, and replaced them with nothing. Once you get to Dragons, there's only Tyrion, Jon, and Dany left to care about, and they're all so neutered in this book that they become completely uninteresting. Tyrion loses his wit and ribaldry, Dany turns into a simpering tween, and Jon . . . yeah. Arya, who used to be interesting, spends the entire book going nowhere and doing very little.<br /><br />Vast, vast chunks of Dragons should have been cut out by an editor with some balls. What was the point of the Martell kid side story, or the countless repetition of phrases: \\"bread still warm from the oven,\\" \\"Jon Snow you know nothing,\\" etc.? It's as if Martin has macroed phrases that he hits on his keyboard when he needs to up the page count.<br /><br />Martin does an excellent job of world-building, and like others have said, the first three books in this series were masterfully done. But after the tedious mess of Crows, Dragons stumbles even further. There's little, if any, plot, and for some of the characters (Dany) their development seems to be going backwards. He keeps throwing in minor characters that I guess we're supposed to care about, but doesn't spend any time fleshing them out (see: all of Mereen.) Martin apparently has gotten tired of writing these books, and his editors are so cowed by his earlier success that won't actually edit anything (shades of George Lucas with the prequels lol.)<br /><br />It's pretty clear Martin only finished this book due to contractual agreements with the publisher, and has lost interest in doing anything more than just filling pages with words. This series has turned into an absolute mess.
B0052VUNHC|1.0|At 35 I must be too old for this book. I kept waiting for this book to get good but it never did. I really tried to get into this but could not.  It was all over the place and so unbelievable. Travis was way too possessive. Fast forward 20 years and I could see Travis as a controlling and dominating husband and Abby trying to run away to save her life! Possessiveness and jealousy to that extent is not romantic but worrying and disturbing. I have to admit that I actually found this trait in a lead male character ok in books such as twilight but this went too far.
0307477479|5.0|Other authors considered for top literary prizes, even those who attempt to devote single chapters to different characters, often write all of their characters with the same voice, the same kind of inner monologues, and ultimately fail at distinguishing one from the other. Jennifer Egan does the opposite here, deftly playing with perspective, style, tone, and form, to bring each person alive on the page. The interwoven stories can be a bit confusing, but I'm only too happy to go back for a second read to pick up on any tidbits I may have missed.  This book more than deserves all of the accolades it has received, and I am happy that this author has been rewarded for pushing the boundaries of fiction rather than just serving up reheated copies of past work.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I am enjoying this puzzle game. Unique challenges and peaceful music.I would recommend this game. Very inexpensive but worth the money &amp; more.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|I was surprised with the quality of the construction and the flexibility of the layout inside the backpack to accommodate all sorts of lens sizes and equipment.  Padding seems adequate and the durability from what I can tell so far is very good.  Time will tell though as I've had this backpack for less than a months and only taken one trip outdoors with it.  Form and function are great and for the money it's a great backpack for camera equipment.  I'm hauling around a Canon 7D and 3 different lenses with batteries, iPad, extra memory cards etc...  If you have a macbook air it should fit into the sleeve no problem, my MacBook Pro 15\\" won't fit but I knew that before I purchased it.  The iPad with the USB converter is the best way to go for me right now. And it all fits no problem.    Steve
0307454541|3.0|It's an alright read. I still am having trouble deciding if I truly liked this book or not.<br /><br />I'll begin on a negative note; Larsson creates a mountain of a plotline--and don't get me wrong, it's a mightily intriguing plotline--but alas, said mountain is constructed almost entirely of poo. The writing (perhaps this is the translator's fault) is pretty awful. I could sit down and circle page after page of overused, dull cliches. I've seen more artful writing in Young Adult books.<br /><br />The characters are a little flat. The only character I found mildly amusing was Cecelia Vanger (and her appearances are brief). Lisbeth is frustrating and, at times, almost unbelievable--\\"too good\\" at what she does. The antagonist(s) involved in the Biblical murders described in the novel are a long, long ways from believably portrayed. They are, rather, cardboard cutouts of people doing terribly vicious things. I want to be disgusted, disturbed, and moved by the heinous crimes of these characters. The descriptions in this department are more newspaper-like, censored a bit for the comfort of the general public. One learns just enough to be disgusted and shake their head, but that is about it. I expected something deeper, more grisly and chilling. The crime descriptions don't creep beneath your flesh and don't stay stuck in your head, bothering you for days after you read them.<br /><br />All this nit-picky, technical ranting aside, the plotline was actually very good. It is an addicting, easy-to-read tale that I found myself struggling to put down in the middle of my work day. I admire the plot very much. The Biblical passages in connection with the murders, the slow unraveling of evidence, the array of perfectly plausible suspects, etc. It'll keep you on your toes until the end.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to others for the plotline and the readability in itself, however. I guess a mountain is still a mountain, even if it is made of poo.
0439023521|5.0|I must first start off by saying....I DON'T like reading!! But, I was flying to Whasington state by myself for the first time and thought reading a book could distract me, I HATE flying! My sister in law had suggested this book to my 13 year old son, so I figured I could buy this book and if I didn't read it all my son could have it. I could not put this book down!! I LOVED it! I'm a person who NEVER reads (except magazines and news on the internet) and probably has never finished a whole book in my life. I immediately rushed out and got the last 2 book and finished the trilogy in 10 days, if my life wasn't so busy I would have finished them quicker. I Loved how it was written in 1st person. I can't stop thinking about the character and wished the story kept going. I can't wait for the movie to come out in march 2012!! Thanks to Hunger Games I have now found a new hobby....reading! Read the books you will love them!
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a great little strategy game. The levels become progressively more difficult as you go through the addition of new elements. The background music is calming, and all of the other features are well put together. Well worth the price. I have played it for a few hours and am still interested.
1594744769|5.0|This story has a very interesting story line, unexpected twists that I could not even dream up.  The writer was able to make me see the story and left some up for my own imagination which I really loved, I also LOVED the pictures added to the book but he only put them in after describing what you were about to see; I had to make myself not look at them in advance.  I am looking forward to mabe a second book.
1416562605|5.0|Smart but witty, funny but very dark and disturbing. White Tiger is not a heavy read but brings out some important social issues in India: corruption, cast system and terrorism.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I had been aware of The Hunger Games for a couple of years but was reluctant to read it for two reasons:  \\"Popular,\\" hyped books tend to not be as appealing to me as they seem to be to many adoring fans (Just for the record, I fell in love with Harry and his plight long before he became a household name!), and I did not like the premise.  The idea of children killing children as a national sport, televised, as an entire nation watches, disgusts and appalls me.  I could not imagine a scenario where that would be a possibility, and definitely couldn't see myself reading about it.  But something about the book captured my attention and kept drawing me back to it until I finally purchased it when it was on sale.  However, it still took me another six months to find the time and desire to read it.<br /><br />I'm glad I did.  I'm also glad I waited until a break from school, because once I started, the book was hard to put down.  Katniss captivated me from the start, as did some other characters I met along the way.  Most of the main characters were realistic and real, fleshed out in ways that allowed me to see them, to participate with them, to become them at times.  When Katniss was in the arena, I was there with her, feeling her pain, her loneliness, her confusion, her fears.  Suzanne Collins had the skills to convince me that not only were the Hunger Games possible, they were an actuality, a yearly event in post-America Panem.<br /><br />I knew going in that this was the first of a trilogy, but hoped that this book was a stand-alone novel.  In a sense it is, especially if you have no concern for any of the characters outside the arena, but there are many unanswered questions, many issues yet to be settled.  I'm off to purchase the second book in the series, and will probably end up buying the third shortly after that.  Thank God for summer vacation...
B004BLJQOK|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and thought it was the most amazing movie I've seen in a while. I don't see many movies in the theaters lately that really grab my attention and sometimes i leave disappointed. I saw this, and wasn't the least bit disappointed. I think this movie was brilliantly made.
B003IY47JK|3.0|The ONLY thing I dislike about this album--and the \\"symphonic metal\\" genre in general--is that ridiculous and horridly ugly \\"cookie monster growl\\" sound which is employed on some of these tracks. This gimmick is dumb and horrendously ugly and nearly ruins some tracks that are otherwise great.     Aside from that: engrossing songs, beautiful vocals, original and refreshing, dramatic and fun. Good stuff, but lose the ugly and laughable \\"metal dude\\" barking/growling.
B001E45XT4|5.0|Bought this headset/mic unit quite awhile ago, and just now reviewing it.  Im rough on it, alot rougher than I should be.  I get the cord tangled up in my legs, or the legs of my chair; Ive yanked its jacks out of the computer that way several times, dropped the whole unit on the floor more times than I can remember, Ive really put this thing through the wringer.  It still works great though.  Its a bit heavy, but I think the extra material makes it more durable.  Being heavy is the only thing I find a little uncomfortable about it.  I love the cushions around the ears, and in the part that settles down on my head.  I can wear it for hours and never have a sore spot from where it rests on my head.  The mic tucks away completely into the head band part of the head set, and that is also very convenient.  When the mic is tucked away, its like youre wearing just a head set--no mic boom at all hovering in front of your face.  Im sure this is not a headset all the \\"sound purists\\" would flock to, but for an audio mutt like me, it does the trick just fine :P
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book moved me in ways few books have.  More than once, I teared up as I was reading this book, and I don't cry easily.  The whole series is gripping.  I devoured all three books in five days, then immediately reread the entire series in order to capture what I may have missed in my original race to the stunning conclusion.<br /><br />A number of reviewers have commented that they hated the ending, but I think it was perfect.  War changes people and it changes relationships.  There is no way Katniss and Gale or Katniss and Peeta could pick up their relationship and continue as if war had never happened.  Yes, the book was sad and disturbing, but so is war, so is life.  And the book also ended with hope, hope for Katniss, for Peeta, for Gale, for humanity.  I wouldn't change a word.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|The 3 BluRay Disc extended edition of \\"Avatar\\" absolutely ROCKS! The set includes the original theatrical release, the extended edition which was released in theaters, and a Collector's extended version which includes even more scenes not in either of the first two versions. And the two discs of bonus material make the set an even greater value! I would heartily recommend this set for any avid fan of James Cameron's SciFi masterpiece!
030788743X|5.0|Ready Player one is descended from a long line of brilliant science fiction.  From 1984 to Snow Crash and Little Brother, this is a book of adventure that will have you on the edge of your seat from the first page until the last.<br /><br />With endless reference to 1980s pop-culture, atari video games, and John Hughes movies, the protagonist struggles for his life both virtually and in the meatspace, in an epic battle against corporate evil, for the top place in on the high-score list.<br /><br />Check out this book, it's an instant classic.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this DVD. It's not boring like other DVD's I've tried. Jillian gets you pumped and ready! After working out I feel energized and like I've accomplished something. I was not overweight when I started this DVD, I was just looking to tone up. I feel as if it is just starting to pay off now and I have been doing it for about 20 days. I am looking and feeling a lot better! I will definitely continue.  My only complaint is that unless you leave the DVD in the player like I try to do, you must wait through 5 minutes of talking. Having to do this everyday would be stupid and the producers should have thought that through and allowed it to be skipped!!
B003O86FMW|5.0|This second book in The Hunger Games series is every bit as compelling, powerful, and emotionally intense as the first.  Katniss unwittingly and unintentionally defied the government by her actions in the first Hunger Games, and now the President is out to get her.  Conflicted by her feelings for the two men in her life who both love her, scarred by the death of her father and by what she saw and did in her first Games, terrified for her family and friends, Katniss is a little too quick with her weapons and a little too slow to trust - with good reason.  This book pulled me in and held me under as completely as the first.  My only complaint is that I now have to buy the third book to see what happens to these characters with whom I have so thoroughly bonded.
B002ZG975Q|4.0|This is a really fun movie about how a boy and girl fall in love. However it is not your typical romantic movie and how they fall in love is quite unusual.
0439023521|5.0|Good story. I purchased it used through Amazon and it arrived looking like a new book. A good way to support recycling and save money!
B005DG8PEE|5.0|3 DOORS DOWN IS BY FAR MY FAVORITE BAND, AND THIS ALBUM DOESN'T CHANGE THAT.  THIS ALBUM, JUST LIKE EVERY ONE THEY HAVE PUT OUT, IS JUST AS GOOD AS THE THE LAST!  THIS ALBUM IS EXCEPTIONAL. THE SONGS ON IT GIVE YOU SUCH A GREAT FEELING, WITH A DIFFERENT FEELING WITH EACH SONG.  MY FAVORITES WOULD HAVE TO BE \\"HEAVEN\\", WHAT'S LEFT\\", AND \\"ROUND AND ROUND\\", BUT EVERY SONG ON THIS ALBUM IS AWESOME!!! FIVE OUT OF FIVE STARS WITHOUT A DOUBT! LOVE IT!  ALSO, THE BONUS DVD IS FANTASTIC!  IT INCLUDES I THINK FOUR SONGS FROM TIME OF MY LIFE AS WELL AS \\"KRYTONITE\\", AWAY FROM THE SUN\\", AND \\"LET ME BE MYSELF\\".  ITS PRETTY AWESOME!  GREAT PURCHASE AND YOU WILL LOVE IT!
B0040HO16S|4.0|this entire series is fabulous. Season 1 is an intro to all the characters and the history and going ons of people of Larkrise. it was a bit slow, but season 2 is probably my favorite, the whole series is great. makes you want to curl up with hot tea and blanket, great way to ease stress and relax and be transported back to the 19th century. Lark Rise to Candleford is like a really good book.
B002ZG99TA|3.0|I didn't have high expectations from this movie, but all in all, it was a very good movie in every respect.  Acting, script, casting, etc all great, with lot of action.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple: an incompetent employee makes a mis-judgement and lets the freight train go unattended, without brakes, under power, with a dangerous cargo.  The rest of the time the people from the corporate headquarters, the yard master, employees, the local authorities, all have to deal with this problem.  In the end the two low level employees become the heroes by saving the day.  Everybody go home now!<br /><br />That is one problem with this movie: no surprises.<br /><br />I still recommend it, it is a great movie to watch.
1451629184|5.0|This book was hard to read at times--reading about the abuse this innocent girl suffered at the hands of this monster and his wife.   I applaud Jaycee for having the courage to write this book.   It was a book well written--and I hope she will write more books in the future.    During her captivity, she wrote a list of things she hoped to accoplish in life--and one was to write a best seller.  She wrote one this time--and I hope she will write more in the future--either about her life in the years to come--or even a novel.  She can do anything  she wants to do now--and I hope for the very best for her and her daughters!  May they all have happy lives--and Jaycee's doting mother too.  A mother who never gave up hope.  The book is a source of hope and inspiration to all of us--that good can triumph over evil!  You deserve the very best in your life, Jaycee!
1451629184|5.0|I found the book was written very well and tastefully.  Not too graphic, as it could have been, but still got the horridness of the situation across.I think Jaycee must be a VERY, VERY strong young lady.  Had a senior moment!!
B000ZFI1GK|5.0|This is a fantastic CD.  The Eagles are still rolling along strongly after all these years!  The songs are all well written and the harmony is pure Eagles!
B004YXE438|5.0|I love puzzles and this is one of my very favorite. Love that you can make puzzles out of your own pictures. More fun than regular slide puzzles and many more options.
B0042J6VUS|1.0|I paid just over $5, and I got junk. Garbage. This is extremely cheap plastic and if you paid for an iPhone like I did, why risk it falling out of the clamp or having the stand fall over. However, for $5, it's probably not worth sending back.    I'm suspicious of the rave reviews. iBox employees? Do not trust them.
B000MR9D5E|1.0|Videos are great but they were scratched and did not play well.  Waste of money....I will not buy DVDs from Amazon again.
B004LUS390|5.0|Can they seriously fit so many features into one mobile app?  I mean, layers, brushes, undo/redo, transparency...geez... and it all works flawlessly.
B000L3CHC0|4.0|I was in the market for an affordable, quality, Swiss movement watch, and was looking at other models made by Tissot. I decided on the PRC 200 because of the reviews made by others and now I'm able to see for myself why it receives so much praise. The face is big but not obnoxious, and the yellow markers are a nice subtle addition. It has a nice weight to it and the satin finish on the band and surrounding the face is definitely noticeable. Great timepiece, I would definitely recommend to anyone in the market for a nice watch without breaking the bank.

B005HGKW6E|5.0|Mark Twain once said that \\"history doesn't repeat itself, but it does rhyme.\\"  I suppose that's why we make the same mistakes over and over.  Even in the Information Age we can't seem to learn from history.

B004OZOTSQ|5.0|You can always tell when an app was the free app of the day, all of the 1 star reviews will be clustered around that day (perhaps 5 minutes after download.) I would rather give an app more of a chance just in case the problem was on my end, especially if I was leaning negative. Alright, dismounting soapbox now. I found this app easy to setup (all I needed to add was a password). The interface is laid out nicely and easy to understand. Operation was easy, just start it. I&apos;m using this on an Asus Transformer running 3.2 and it worked great. On the Asus, set the root path to / so that you can access the built-in memory as well as your sd card. If you try the app for more than 5 minutes, you will find that it&apos;s a simple, lightweight, easy to use app. It provides the convenience of transferring files between PC and phone / tablet without using a cable or removing the memory card.
B004TTMYQG|4.0|It work great with HTC EVO with my Google calendar and reminded me all events since the update the developer removed the widget. I sent an email to Amazon.com hoping it comes back it it does the app gets 5 stars
B004XJHBCE|5.0|I got this app when it was the free app of the day. I initially had some problems using it, but unlike some folks, I didn&apos;t write a bad review 5 minutes after download. I&apos;m using it on an Asus Transformer tablet running 3.2. I checked out the website for the how-to it has Listed, it seems geared more towards using the app on a phone. The app does utilize the larger screen size of the tablet nicely. It took some playing around with the app to get the feel of it, but once you get it figured out, you can start organizing your stuff. It still has a few little quirks, but I&apos;m sure those will get worked out over time. Overall, it looks like a well put together application.
B004LWZW24|3.0|Well my friend and I were waiting for the great haunting moments that we heard about to pop up but the movie has now ended. Well!  It depends on what frightens and entertains you. \\"Different strokes for different folks.\\"
B005EP1PJQ|5.0|Every once in awhile I read a book that I absolutely do not want to end, and Anna and the French Kiss was the first one like that in a LONG time for me! This afternoon when I looked down and saw I only had 20 pages left, I put the book down and began procrastinating! (My sister, who is visiting from her University, is still laughing at me for this! Of course, she just started reading, so we'll see who is laughing tomorrow when she complains she was up all night! )<br /><br />I realize I'm slow to pick up this book, and I grabbed it in anticipation for \\"Lola and the Boy Next Door\\". But I am so incredibly glad I did. Stephanie Perkins does such a great job of creating fabulous characters. From the beginning, Anna is everything I wanted to be (or thought I wanted to be) at seventeen. And I fell in love with St. Clair early in the book, when he took Anna out for her first exploration of Paris!<br /><br />This cast of characters was diverse and loveable. I found myself laughing out loud, anxious to share bits with anyone who would listen! I loved every minute of Anna and the French Kiss!<br /><br />Despite my insane jealousy of Anna for attending a French Boarding school? I have to say that this was one of the most enjoyable books I've read this year!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I have played through the story 4 times now and I still live playing it.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|I wouldn't order this from a third party seller; too many bootlegs. Here is what I found with the one I received:   1. Set does not have the poster or insert.   2. The disc cases have two discs on one side and the official release has one disc on each side.   3. The cases in the official set are molded together, these are just taped together.   4. Starting in the third set of cases, half the discs have a sleeve over them, this is not done in the official release.   5. Some of the episode titles are incorrect (with obvious missing letter Q); Hide and O instead of Hide and Q, The Big Goodbyb instead of The Big Goodbye, Heart of Clorv instead of Heart of Glory, Loud as Whisper instead of Loud as a Whisper, O Who? instead of Q Who?, Deja O instead of Deja Q, Tmenage a Troi instead of Menage a Troi, Opid instead of Qpid, episode Cause and Effect is repeated on the season 5 discs and Imaginary Friend is missing, True O instead of True Q, Aouiel instead of Aquiel, etc.    6. There are numerous Stardate errors and original air date errors.  7. The details on the back of the case are different from the official version.    I'm not sure if I'm allowed to mention the seller's name, so I won't, but it has been reported to Amazon. I do have to thank him for being such a stupid stubborn seller and refusing to provide a full refund when I first notified him that the set was damaged. It was only after he refused that I took a closer look at the set and caught all the discrepancies. Beware! The set I bought appeared to be New with the packaging slightly torn but not fully off and a broken corner of the plastic case (which I why I wanted to return for full refund).
B00425S1H8|3.0|The cable works fine. But you cannot plug RS-232 side directly into most devices (in my case, the device is a Router). You have to use a RS232 exension cable (like the one from KVM). This is because most devices' RS-232 has female screws on both sides and this cable also has female screws on both sides. You can take a closer look at the cable to see this. This cable should have either male screws or none at all.
B0059R5Q08|2.0|Okay, I was thinking this was worth 3 stars until the end.  I am so sick of these movies getting Mr. Rochester's character so, so, so wrong.  (Um, is this is spoiler coming up?  I don't know, so I'll just say that, I guess).  Where was the redemption, the apology at the end?  Oh, I guess we didn't need it because he was so freakin' nice during the whole of this movie that he didn't need to be redeemed?  Um, no.  And he was way too nice through the vast majority of it.  Where was the changeability, the moodiness?  He's a manipulative jerk in the book while trying to make Jane crazy for him, but in this movie, he's usually an okay, if weak, kind of guy.  The movie did the double-talk of confusing Jane about Blanche and Bertha pretty well; the character just wasn't Mr. Rochester.  This movie made up a new character.  For pete's sake, he's supposed to be villainous - he lies and then tries to coerce the person he loves into giving up her core self, not to mention he's tormented and half-crazy himself.  He shouldn't be portrayed softly as a lover (or not exclusively so).  I was already annoyed that we didn't get to see his extreme disrespectfulness from the gypsy scene, because that scene really goes a long way to showing the reader how corrupt but redeemable he is.  But this ending really set me off, because it went against every reason Charlotte Bronte wrote this book.  We're supposed to see how he's changed, how he, not just Jane, can be happy.  All we see is that he's blind and got a crutch (nurse?  girlfriend?  mistress?  wife?  it's anybody's guess with this ending!)  This isn't a romance novel or romantic comedy.  You don't cut out the redemption, the significance, the lessons of the first 115 minutes.  If you do, viewers might feel cheated out of their time and money.  Hint hint.    Now that said, I could actually get through this interpretation, while most of the others, I can't even stand.  Zeffirelli's changes things so much and is generally dry (plus I can'tget past Gainsbourg's braces!).  The Morton and Hinds version has Hinds chewing the scenery and playing Rochester as a one-sided meany.  Clarke and Dalton I barely remember as worth anything, and I hated the portrayal of Jane.  And one of these changes the part with the Rivers so much that it makes all of the themes of integrity, empowerment and redemption disappear.  This version had the opportunity to carry them out because it decently portrayed the Rivers' plot (except, why wasn't it acknowledged that the Eyres and Rivers were related?  Failure to read carefully?).  But it failed when Jane met Edward again.  The only adaptation I actually like is the BBC's 2006 version (well, of course I also like the Fontaine and Welles' version, but not for the portrayal of the novel so much as a historical film).  It's obvious this story can't really be condensed into a movie-theater production.    So, what can I say that's positive?  I really loved Wasikowska portrayal of Jane - it was spot-on.  Fassbender did a good job with Rochester as well, with the faulty material he was given.  The story, the setting, the characters, all that was good.  But the screen-writing and maybe directing as well was really, really bad (that's saying something for the actors that they could do such a good job with it).  My essential problem is just that the feelings and themes of the book just did not come through, and for that I'm blaming the script, even despite that it used actual dialogue from the book (which were its best moments).  And also as others have said, it does rush through the content while still seeming to plod boringly at times.  For that reason, it's probably inaccessible to viewers who have never read the book, but again, it doesn't stay true to the book's themes enough to satisfy those who know and love it well.  Not a good dichotomy.    So that's my rant.  Ugh, I'm so mad I paid $3.99 for this.  But at least it saved me from buying it.  I think I'll get my Kindle out so thatI can wash this horrible ending from my brain and put it right, Bronte-style.  Thank you, Project Gutenburg for some much needed redempmtion there.  Can everyone else please, please just give up trying to adapt Bronte's vision?  It ends up being one-dimensional and trite over and over again.  Just stop.
0756659841|5.0|The single most amazing thing about this book is the price. Especially compared to the cost of ANY Lego kit.  For about 1/2 of the cost of a small Lego kit, you can give your child hours and hours of pleasure playing with what they love...Legos.  The stickers being reusable have a hidden bonus...they won't stick to your walls, fishtank, windows, etc without being easily removed.  Let them get crazy with the stickers, they peel right off of the walls.<br /><br />EXTRA BONUS - When you are staggering through your kid's room in the middle of the night, or in the dark of the morning...you will not destroy the bottom of your feet when you step on the stickers  :)<br />Seriously, how do they design Legos to stick to the bottom of your foot in a way that means they don't just inflict pain once on the heel or arch of your foot, but at least three times until you stumble into a wall and pull them off in agony...sucking air in and out of your lungs like someone just shot your heel with a 22 pistol.<br /><br />Final suggestion:  Your kids will enjoy this product as much as your feet will.
1451629184|4.0|I admire Jaycee Dugard for having the courage to write about the misery she endured for eighteen years. I can't even fathom the idea of being sexually and emotionally abused for that long. If it were me, I would have lost it one day and either killed the man in his sleep or ran for my life. The fact that she was too scared and barely questioned the fact of escaping blows my mind. However, I understand that it seemed too risky to escape with two children. Putting them in danger is the worst feeling any parent would have. Oddly enough, I don't understand why the neighbors didn't complain multiple times about the children living in the yard. That kind of thing just wouldn't fly in my neighborhood, especially if I knew my neighbor was a registered sex offender.            The other thing I don't get is why didn't Jaycee beg Nancy to let her go when she had the chance? For instance, the WHOLE month that Philip was in jail for a violation or when Nancy and her went shopping by themselves. Obviously, Philip wouldn't be able to do anything if they went to the police and explained the situation- he was already in jail and he would just do more time! I don't blame the parole officers for the whole thing, I do blame Jaycee for not trying hard enough to escape. She had several opportunities! Again, I would do everything in my willpower to save my children from an awful, abnormal life! If she escaped, what's the worst that could happen? Either she escapes with no problem or he kills her. Heck, I would rather die then be stuck with him for eighteen MORE years!

B004G600A4|4.0|First of all let me say the movie is pleasant and entertaining and one the kids will undoubtedly enjoy. All of the classic Disney elements are there, the lovely heroine, the awkward hero, the loveable sidekick, the fearful villain, and a sympathetic chorus of unlikely defenders. Disney re-mixes these familiar elements into a new concoction based on the Grimm's fairy tale of Rapunzel.<br /><br />There is nice music and singing and plenty of humorous situations to delight the young and the young at heart. Disney has decided to update the dialogue to reflect current phrases and words that are very contemporary and up-to-date. While this may be engaging to the younger audience it imposes a timeframe which will date it before too long as language usage changes quickly.<br /><br />If you have youngsters in the house this will be a winner.

B004LWZVZC|1.0|As a history teacher, I found this to be a well-acted film, but my big complaint is that Robert Redford chose to tell this particular story at all; especially given author Kate Clifford Larson's comments on the bonus feature disc that make it clear Mary Surratt was in fact GUILTY of being part of the conspiracy to assassinate Lincoln and overthrow the U.S. government.    Clifford, author of 'The Assassin's Accomplice,\\" says \\"The evidence became very clear that she (Mary Surratt) was involved in Boothe's plans.  People can argue that the witnesses lied, but that actually makes no sense.  And there were too many people who placed her within the close ranks of the conspiracy. They were very specific about her role.\\"  I found the same conclusion in \\"The Conspiracy\\" section of Ford's Theatre in D.C., which I just visited this past summer.    So my big complaint is that I wasted two hours of my time being manipulated into feeling sorry for Mary Surratt while feeling   anger towards Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, Lincoln's close confidant and friend throughout the Civil War.    But I guess it's more chic to once again blame the U.S. government

B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I just finished this book.  I have loved all of books I have read written by this author but the emotions that I felt while reading this book were ones I have not yet felt when reading the others.  It was so descriptive that I could picture each character and each scenario so clearly.  At times, I almost felt ill.  The love between the characters (even at a young age) is something everyone yearns for in their lifetime.  However, the sadness that is felt by Em is so painful, as is the emotions felt by Chris.  I highly recommend this book to anyone. However, it was not something I could keep reading. I needed time to \\"let things settle\\" in my mind before I could get through to the end.  And, as all endings in JP's books, this one is completely unpredictable.
B0045JEPXK|4.0|I purchased this CD/DVD through Amazon.com and I loved the selections on the DVD and CD except for the track \\"These Dreams are made of this\\" and I'm not saying that I don't care for this track only because the Eurithmics version is the best.  I just felt that Leona did not even attempt to sing this song.  I mean, she had an opportunity to create her own version.  One thing I continue to love about Leona is when she sings in her beautiful lower register even though a lot of people will be expecting her to sing like Mariah Carey used to sing.  Me, I just love the emotion Leona puts into her songs instead of trying to outsing the next Mariah-Christina like voice.
0553801473|3.0|I will echo the sentiments of several other reviewers, that the main thing this book lacked was resolution.  Too many new story threads are created, and if I recall correctly, none of them are really finished, to the point where I feel like George's world is collapsing under its own weight.  On top of that, what George accomplished in this book could have easily been done in 300 pages instead of 900+.  A tremendous amount of repetition and filler invades this book, especially anything involving Meereen.  Even the characters want to move the plot along..<br /><br />Ser Barristan: Your Grace, you must not linger, Westeros and the main plotline await.<br /><br />Daenerys: Noooo, guy.  Meereeeen. Brazen Beasts, Pit Fighting, my chiiiildreeeeen.<br /><br />Ser Barristan: *sigh*<br /><br />There, I just saved you about 400 pages.<br /><br />That being said, George isn't terrible with his execution.  There are a lot of stimulating chapters in the book (maybe these are the chapters he wrote for Feast for Crows?),  As usual, I enjoyed all the chapters with Bran, Arya and Tyrion and the Greyjoys.  There is definitely a lot of good in this book, I just wish I didn't have to spend so much time wading through the rest.
B00425S1H8|5.0|I found myself in a bind when I upgraded my MacBook to Lion iOS.  My IOGear USB-to-Serial adapter stopped working!  The first thing I did was to hit up the Prolific download page to see if there was a new driver for Lion iOS and sure enough there was.  However, this driver did not work with the IOGear adapter, so I contacted IOGear and was told they were working on a driver for Lion...  So, after some additional Googling, I stumbled across the adapter from Plugable.  This adapter uses the proper Prolific chipset that works w/ the updated driver, so I immediately put it in the shopping cart and eagerly awaited its arrival.  I received the adapter within a week and sat down to see if it would work.  After installing the latest driver from Prolific, I plugged the adapter into my USB port and voila!  Works like a champ!  Now I can configure my Brocade switches and Storage Arrays at work using my MacBook and all is right with the world again...

0143119419|5.0|In a lot of ways this book review does not belong in my series on the financial crisis of 2008 because well over 350 pages of the 500-page book have nothing to do with the financial crisis itself.  But in one very important sense this book is extremely important to the aftermath of the crisis, and I hope to make that sense clear in this review.  &lt;em>More Money than God&lt;/em> should be required reading for anyone in my business, and I mean that with complete seriousness.  It is an utterly fascinating look at the history of the hedge fund industry, and in telling the story of this ascension of this world-changing business, author Sebastian Mallaby treats his readers to an in-depth look at the individual stories of the biggest names in hedge fund history (George Soros, Stanley Drunkenmiller, Julian Robertson, Paul Tudor Jones, John Paulson, A.W. Jones, Jim Simons, Ken Griffin, and several others).  But this is not history and biography for history and biography's sake; Mallaby treats his readers to a thorough discussion of the Efficient Markets Hypothesis, and demonstrates more investment knowledge when it comes to subjects like alpha, arbitrage, and contrarianism than almost any Wall Street analyst I have read (which is essentially everyone of them ).<br /><br />The reason for including this book in a review series that is focused on 2008's debacle is because Congress and the media have picked a fight with the hedge fund industry, and Mallaby is the first author to enter the public fray &lt;em>to actually defend the billionaires&lt;/em>.  One may think that with a title like &lt;em>More Money than God&lt;/em> that generic class envy would permeate the book.  But alas, Mallaby is too intelligent for such drivel.  And regardless of what one thinks about the lifestyles (not to mention the politics) of the rich and famous in Greenwich/Manhattan, the reality is that Congress and the media are shooting blanks when it comes to placing any of the blame of the 2008 crisis on hedge funds.<br /><br />Mallaby ably points out that hedge funds did not receive any taxpayer bailout money after 2008.  Some of them profited wildly (which I imagine their investors find to be a good thing).  Some of them blew up (and as is the case in a risk/reward market system, suffered the due wrath involved in that).  The vast majority delivered returns below 0%, but far better than the market itself (likely also pleasing the investors in the various funds).  Mallaby's point which must be understood is that hedge funds by definition are \\"small enough to fail\\".  They use far less leverage than the major banks did (and still do).  The largest investors in hedge funds are almost always the very people running them.  And most importantly, hedge funds seek out (and find) anomalies in the marketplace and make for a far more liquid and honest playing field.  They have brought to the investment landscape a huge divergence of opinions, perspectives, strategies, and methodologies.  Investors are so much better off for this ...  One can look at some of the more notorious hedge fund blow-ups in the last fifteen years, but none of them set off a chain reaction like the fall of Lehman did, and none of them received money from taxpayers to stabilize the system.  This is a true \\"eat what you kill\\" world, and Mallaby demonstrates that hedge funds had no role whatsoever in making the financial crisis of 2008 worse; for many institutional and retail investors, they actually softened it a great deal.<br /><br />One of the popular rallying cries against hedge funds is their lack of transparency.  Various economic nitwits in Congress have screamed that hedge funds have a responsibility to disclose their positions to their investors.  I (and Mallaby) would argue that hedge funds have no such responsibility, provided that they gave the one disclosure that matters to their investors: &lt;em>We will not be disclosing our positions to you&lt;/em>.  Mallaby uses this point of contention to give some of the greatest examples of the law of unintended consequences I have ever seen.  The privacy hedge funds desire in their trading book is not contrary to their investor's best interests (and if it were, the investors do not have to invest); it is positively correlated with their investor's best interests.  Congress just can not get out of its own way, and this disclosure issue is Exhibit A.  It is when the market knows a hedge fund's trading book that that fund is most susceptible to risk.  The wisdom (or lack thereof) of telling your clients what you own is a matter best left to the fund and its own investors, and Mallaby uses careful logic and empirical evidence to make this case.<br /><br />All readers of my financial crisis series should want the same thing I do: A future investing landscape that rewards good risk-taking and punishes bad risk-taking; a future landscape that is prepared to intelligently allocate capital in what will certainly be a challenging period.  The aftermath to the crisis has been to mistakenly assume that government regulation will accomplish all of that.  As Mallaby's tremendous book shows, though, this is not the case at all.  Best of breed investment managers prudently seeking out inefficiencies in a marketplace that is chalk-full of them is an ideal solution to the investing need of the hour.  In the hedge fund industry, we have just that.  No, these men are not all angels (as Mallaby grants), but of course neither are the regulators, politicians, or big banks either.  What they are, though, is the best innovation a market system has come up with (to date) for providing superior risk-adjusted investment strategies to an institutional and retail investor population, without the backstop of the American taxpayer.  Kudos to Mallaby for this phenomenal book.  May this not be the last we hear from him ...<br /><br />P.S. - I may do my own research some day as to why exactly so many of these quintessential free market pioneers, the captains of the hedge fund industry who bathe in the risks and rewards of capitalism every day, are so often pre-disposed to such left wing lunacy.  Granted, they are not all extremist radicals like George Soros, who in this book you will see the true summation of a sociopathic hypocrite.  But of the dozens of hedge fund friends I have in the city, and of the major characters in this book whom I do not know, the vast majority are often ultra-left in their personal politics.

0553801473|1.0|At about 900 reviews to date of A Dance With Dragons I doubt my humble review will either encourage or discourage anyone from reading this book.  However, I feel the need to throw my hat into the ring.<br /><br />I HAVE read and reread the previous 4 books in this series.  This will come as no surprise but I thoroughly enjoyed the first 3 books.  In fact as a reader of fantasy, I felt Mr. Martin brought a whole new dimension to the genre.  He had a way of making us look at people and their motivations in a whole new light - I always felt that there was a bitter truth to his writing - that even though it was fantasy it was very much real - yes there are people who are truly good and are not motivated by selfish interests, but by the interest and betterment of others - but there are many who are selfish, willing to win at all costs, and will do anything no matter how ugly to achieve their goals.  IMHO no one could write those kinds of characters and situations like GRRM.  Sadly, in A Feast for Crows that began to change (I believe I gave that book 3 stars with a wait a see about what was supposed to be forthcoming A Dance With Dragons.<br /><br />Forward to 2011 and A Dance With Dragons has arrived.  Unfortunately, I found it to be a major disappointment.  It has a even slower pace (who would have thought that possible) than AFfC and my most beloved characters have taken a giant leap backward in their personal development.  To all the 5 star reviewers I respect that it  is a matter of personal opinion.  I wish I could have loved this book as much as many of you do, unfortunately, I do not.  Why?  Well here are several of my reasons:<br /><br />Possible Spoilers (I don't think so, but .....)<br /><br />Tyrion:  probably my favorite surviving character up to this point (others I cared about had already fallen by the wayside unless strangly resurrected in this book - I am not even going to go there . . .).  He has always been a strong character, great at plotting and schemes, surviving against overwhelming odds by the use of his wit - now he is a pale reflection of that character, whiney, playing a fool - and if I had to hear \\"where do whore's go\\" one more time I was going to scream.<br /><br />Daenerys:  A woman who has overcome unbelieveable odds, virtually coming through the fire, crossing deserts, raising an army, hatching dragons, intent on her purpose to return to Westeros and reclaim the throne she feels was stolen from her family has become an ineffectual, sex starved, wanna-be queen.  The way she has turned on her dragons is so off character that it doesn't make sense to me and also the fact that she can no longer make a decision.<br /><br />Pacing - by the end of the book many of our characters never made it to their destination nor were there many plot resolutions.  Since AG of T we have been \\"teased\\" about the Others - yet what more do we know about them?  Poor editing.  Introduction of too many new characters and too much detail in this book on minor characters.<br /><br />I could drone on (like the book) but what is the point.  Personally I am done with the series.  My ending goes something like this:<br /><br /> \\"Others cross the wall,take over all of Westeros,  turn everyone into other \\"Others\\" - sail to all of the other kingdoms and zombie them also - then they all live happily ever after.\\"emes, surviving against overwhelming odds by the use of his wit - now he is a pale reflection of that character, whiney, playing a fool - and if I had to hear \\"where do whore's go\\" one more time I was going to scream.<br /><br />Daenerys:  A woman who has overcome unbelieveable odds, virtually coming through the fire, crossing deserts, raising an army, hatching dragons, intent on her purpose to return to Westeros and reclaim the throne she feels was stolen from her family has become an ineffectual, sex starved, wanna-be queen.

1933633867|5.0|I'm a historian of the boundaries of civilization-- I've written about colonists captured and adopted by American Indians, and am currently writing about the difference between hunter-gatherer societies and 'civilization' with all its ills.  I have never seen the essence of the Fall explained as well as in this book, esp. around p. 163-6.  The 'something new under the sun' of the Agricultural Revolution, roughly 5771 years ago, was not agriculture, was not division of labor, was not domestication of animals.  It was the Alienated Human Being-- which is inextricably wrapped up with slavery, and debt.  Graeber nails it.  I hope he comes and visits me in Jerusalem, we can figure out how to bring the Jubilee...
B00095NX9G|5.0|I am 61 years old and needed to move and lose weight for health reasons.  I joined a dance for fitness/low impact aerobic class.  Meh--it was all right but not exciting.  Then I tried yoga.  Didn't find my zen place.  Then I tried cabaret style bellydancing.  I loved it--the instructor was amazing and made classes fun as well as a good workout.  I incorporated bellydance into my lifestyle, lost weight, got into shape, and am hooked on bellydancing. One of the other instructors begged me to try tribal.  I was in love with the control and movements--if I could just get my body to do that. She suggested I look at anything by Rachel Brice.  I saw Rachel's recommended list on Amazon and bought two of her DVD's--this one and Bellydance Arms and Posture.  Since I have sciatica, the movements keep me moving and off a lot of pain killers.     The yoga workouts with the dancing are step by step and easy to follow.  Rachel's voice-over constantly reminds viewers that if they cannot perform a movement, it's all right.  Do what you can.  I like that approach since I am not in the shape she is in and some days, I can barely move.  Do I look like Rachel when I dance with her?  Absolutely not!!  But I can pretend  :)    This DVD has inspired me to come up with an elderly/wheelchair version of bellydance as a community education class.  I could also teach this in a nursing home setting.    I highly recommend this DVD to anyone who not only loves tribal, but needs/wants to move and get fit.  While I may never dance like Rachel, I am able to do a lot of the movements and keep in shape.  BTW--the instructor and 30-somethings in the class are in awe of my flexibility.  That tells me something  :)
0316017930|5.0|Malcolm Gladewell's point of view on the creative process is right on.  Genius still takes time to nurture and Gladwell's perspective combines historical insight and his conclusions are thought provoking.  His clear examples of the Beatles and other groups who struggled prior to big breakthroughs illustrated his theories.  A terrific book that was an easy read.
B0000VV2GU|2.0|This book is dated, as are the pictures and recipes.  It includes recipes for things like lemon bars and gingerbread and magic bars.  Unimaginative stuff from the 50's that can be found in every cookie book, on every website, in my mother's \\"special\\" recipe file and probably her mother's too.  It's not Rose's fault she wrote it 20 years ago, but unless you are new to baking or very limited in your tastes, look for a newer, more modern cookbook.  The pictures have that sort of yellow 80's tungsten haze over them that is so unappealing.  In the age of digital, it's time for an update!

Is that a fair assessment?    There's no two ways about it: Ready Player One is a modern masterpiece for the rest of us. The geek radiates off this novel like dying star about to supernova. Easily one of the finest amalgamations of videogame/tv/movie geek nirvana ever assembled. I'd love to shower details on how the images conjured in the novel are so pleasing to the pop culture junkie, but that would just be spoiling the fantastic surprises contained therein.     Buy this book, stop reading about it, and let it do the talking by itself.    The OASIS will take you to a whole new world,    READY PLAYER ONE
0553801473|4.0|All four books are outstanding. I can't wait to get started on the fifth book \\"A Dance with Dragons\\". These books are a great read.
0439023521|5.0|it takes some time to get into the story; slow-going at first, but necessary info to know. This is the kind of book you set down because you know you've got other responsibilities and end up picking it right back up so you can start another thrilling chapter!
0756404738|4.0|This book deserves 5 stars because it actually is one of the most engrossing books out there. Sure, it's long and roundabout and full of plot twists and turns that are never resolved. But at the end of it, you just wish for more all the more. This makes sense when you look at Rothfuss's interview here--he just started writing. Not much planning. Decided, heck, why not three books? But he's writing one gigantic story, and hopefully it all fits together well and the books along the way are satisfying in their own right. However, for something like this written by a writer of his ability, I think it would have been better had he written the entire story and then edited it in toto--and then broken it apart into three pieces and edited each of them to be a perfectly publishable piece. Unfortunately, that ain't how things work. So I'll settle for what's here. You can't fault him too much for the structural problems in the book because they come with his ability to write such a good, engrossing book. Everything that sucks about the story structurally would be more easily addressable when looking at the entire story after Rothfuss has finished with it. And it's sad that, for Rothfuss, the necessary conventional constraints of structure repress the full expression of Kvothe's story. I hope he writes the third book as he, not his publishers, wants--and that he breaks it up into however many books and parts he feels appropriate.      A few amusing points about the book (spoiler alert):    1. This book should be called \\"Kvothe Pays His Tuition.\\"    Why? Because that's actually all he ever does. More than anything, the entire series thus far seems to center on the constant struggle for Kvothe to pay his tuition. Sure, he saves the Maer's life, procures the Maer a Lackless bride,  defeats bandits led by one of the Chandrian, sleeps with Felurian, learns some of the Lethani, But all he really cares about is scraping together money and paying his tuition. The beginning of the bookis just like the entire Name of the Wind--scraping together tution here and there, and, even though he has all sorts of interesting adventures in the middle, the end is all about how awesome it is to...have a lot of money and be able to afford tuition. Not only that--it turns the entire institution around with Kvothe actually making money off his tuition. The higher his tuition is, the more he puts it to the man!       2. Did anyone else think think Meluan Lackless's sister who ran off with a Ruh might be Kvothe's mother, who came from a high station and ran off with a Ruh? Seems kinda obvious...      3. In response to  James M. Bennett's point that Kvothe  nibbling every day on an obscure birth control root is ridiculous--I know, right?! The whole argument about conception and men playing no part is ridiculous--it makes me think there must be something else here and we'll learn more in the next book. (or, more likely, Rothfuss just screwed up and left in a dumb part he really shouldn't have). But seriously, Rothfuss is a smart dude and he probably reads these reviews, so he's read Bennett's review and is probably now coming up with a way for this, like so many other things to be explained in the next book. It could go like this--the birth control root is actually served as some sort of staple in most food in Kvothe's universe, and people in populations that don't realize it acts as birth control wind up having significantly fewer children. Conveniently, the Adem don't think this root is of the Lethani--this is revealed in another conversation about birth control with an Adem  mercenary along the way who also ties up all the Adem and Lethani loose ends.
0312323867|5.0|What a great read !!! I couldn't put this book down. It was really addicting and Emily Giffin did such a fabulous job.
B002OG5GT8|2.0|This headphone amplifier does not amplify as well as I thought it would . It is definitely not for an audiophile. The product did amplify my music but raised the decibel level by only 3 decibels(twice as loud). I was expecting much more.
B0043URV8M|5.0|I have enjoyed all the music of the HP films but Desplat really makes the film shine musically. Very different from Williams in style but no less brilliant. I like that he does try to be Williams. I remember hearing the music watching the films just being emotionally taken through the entire film(and part 2 as well)and while the other films after Williams left have some great moments none really brought me through the films quite as well until Desplat.<br /><br />I will be looking up more of his music to be sure and cannot wait to get a copy of HP 7 part 2 which was brilliant as well!
B0046E825G|5.0|It was a wonderful experience, great product, fast, easy service AAA++++ service. Thank you. Will be shopping with you again.  Thank you very much!!!
0312965788|4.0|Great price, easy ordering and receiving. My problem was though the description said 'good' some writing in the book, I wish it said it had a girls name in bold pink letters on the outside. This is a required school reading for my 16 yr. old SON.
1400069181|5.0|This quick little book is a guide for socially conscious entrepreneurship for the Twitter generation, and there is no piece of that description that appeals to me as a reader.  The Amazon Vine program offered me a free copy, though, and I decided to accept it because (1) I'm a big fan of [[ASIN:B004D4Y3IE Amazing Race: Season 2]], on which Mycoskie appeared, and (2) my dad loves the TOMS shoes movement.    Personally, I haven't been enthusiastic about the TOMS idea.  I don't really care for the aesthetics of the shoes, and I thought that, except for volunteers who participate in shoe drops, the charitable side of the company lets rich people feel good without actually having to touch poor people, which presents certain problems.  Plus, I have been given my share of cheesy business books with vaguely inspirational quotes and a hollow you-can-do-it self-reliance message.  So when I selected the book, I expected it to be a vaguely unpleasant experience that I could endure before loaning out my copy to people who fit what I saw as the intended demographic.    My expectations were completely wrong.  I loved this book more than anything I've read in a long time.    Mycoskie writes from the heart here, filling pages with a shameless optimism based on real experience.  He shares many examples from TOMS and other businesses that he's started, both positive and negative, and not the kind of \\"My greatest fault is that I just care too much about this job\\" negative that an applicant makes up during a job interview - there are some real mistakes here that Mycoskie owns as a powerful example of humble leadership.  A reader will get a sense, not only of what it's like to work for TOMS, but what it can be like to start (or restart) any organization with a story to tell.      And when Mycoskie insists that simplicity is a key value of any organization, he practices what he preaches.  These chapters are streamlined, with just enough examples to make each point, and plenty of engagingtext boxes and photographs, showing that simple doesn't mean boring, and visually exciting doesn't mean shallow.  A reader can easily skim through the entire book in one sitting without really noting the passage of time.    The youthful exuberance of the book does not detract from the professionalism of the message.  Mycoskie hits, again and again, the idea that helping the world can be profitable, with plenty of quotes and examples from business leaders and entrepreneurs.  He is not a wide-eyed college freshman but a battle-tested visionary, and he extends his invitations in ways that even the most hard-hearted cynics can be inspired (I include myself here, as it has been many months since I've been inspired on a fundamental level, and lately I have served more from inertia than an actual belief that I can change anything in the world).  This book can not only give you advice on how to start a story-based organization (from core value suggestions to practical links to web sites that provide free resources), it can inspire you to take the next step and actually do it.    I want to buy a copy of this book for every college freshman in the country.  I want it to be an informal textbook in every business school.  I want it to become a viral phenomenon that melts hearts and sharpens minds and changes the world.  And I feel completely humbled to be given the opportunity to read it before it hits the stores.  Please read this book.
0439023491|4.0|I could not find this book for the life at me at any store around my area for less than $19.00. Finally, I looked on Amazon and decided to purchase. It was well worth the wait. The book is hardback and arrived in good condition. The only damage was normal wear and tear on the paper cover over the actual hardback book. The pages inside the book are in great condition and no markings or water spots. Definitely a good deal.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This book was an excellent read.  I did it in two (2) days.  I can't wait for the movie in December.  I loved how the story is told from the horses point of view.  Very well done.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Excellent CD!  I purchased this CD because I like the song that receives radio play, and I was pleasantly surprised to find that every song on the CD is excellent.  Adele has a very strong voice with wide range and emotion.  She has song writing credit on most of the songs, and is clearly a very talented artist.  I recomment this album to anyone that likes her radio song.  You won't be disappointed!
B003ZHVJFK|4.0|Based upon Namco Bandai's fighting game series, Tekken tells the story of Jin Kazama. The year is 2039, to exact revenge on the one who caused his mother's death, Jin must defeat the world's most elite fighters in the \\"Iron Fist Tournament\\".<br /><br />Despite what professional reviewers have been saying about the movie, I personally thought it was a decent martial arts movie. Like most videogame movie adaptions, people are going to pan over this movie and claim it doesn't do the series justice..to which I say- not every movie can have a million dollar budget so certain liberties have to be taken with it. I don't really think the game's storyline would have fit too well in a film, honestly. In that measure, I think Director Dwight Little did an awesome job. The film was entertaining and kept my attention all the way through to the end.<br /><br />The only gripe that I had with the movie was I felt that the fights didn't last long enough onscreen and the camera could've been a little more focused instead of jumping all around the action so much.<br /><br />Still, I liked the film. It did what I hoped it'd do and that was entertain me. To me, that's all that matters in the end. Not naming names but it was alot better than other videogame movies out there to date.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|What can be added except awesome and excellent! I bought this album, and I am so happy to have it in my slide guitar collection. A real gem!
B004WMKSH2|4.0|This is a great Harry Potter film too bad its marred by the terrible transfer. Im not sure how Amazon can allow such a crappy product to leave their warehouse but obviously they have. The movie itself is still worth watching bad transfer or not. Its dark and pixelated in some areas but after a few minutes you get used to it and are able to block it out of your vision. Amazon is doing a diservice to HP but it cannot kill the fact its a great movie. Thats the reason i did not give it 5 stars..
B003L77GRO|4.0|The season itself was excellent, as usual, but the DVD itself is utterly ridiculous. The special features are all supposed to be accessed via \\"E Bridge Technology\\". What is this exactly? It's not explained on or in the DVD anywhere. So, with the features not on the TV, I popped the DVD in my laptop. \\"Ebridge Technology\\" pops up and I click on \\"Access Dexter Special Features\\". But what pops up? Not the features for season five, but for season four. One would think the DVD features would be handled a lot better than this, and I am thoroughly disappointed.
0345529057|5.0|This series is amazing and i highly recommend it to all fantasy fans. The writing is great and the story is intricate and interesting. The books are much better than the HBO TV series and if you like the show you should definitely read the books.     The only disadvantage of this set is the low quality of the box that the books are in but for the low price its still much better than buying the books individually.    I highly recommend reading this series.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|First, Great Casting!  David Tennant as Peter Vincent is inspired casting, as the decadent Las Vegas stage magician / vampire slayer. Seeing 'the Doctor' drop the F-Bomb(s) was a joy (although he was more Barty Crouch Jr. Meets Chris Angel as played by a Scottish Russell Brand, but brilliant!) Anton Yelchin (Star Trek)was reformed dweeb Charlie Brewster, playing the distracted would-be hero perfectly to type. Mintz-Plasse (McLovin) is good as Evil Ed, In this case Charlie's ex-sidekick now that Brewster is dating out of his league. Their classmates are disappearing, Ed is already wary of vampire goings-on and tries unsuccessfully to bring Charlie in on it.<br /><br /> In the New Orleans papers they only got 2 stars, they (like some Amazon reviewers) clearly didn't get it... It was superbly done, perfect balance of tones, while being just enough of a tribute to the original ( in fact there's an obvious cameo ad well)  but totally it's own film. A modern statue to the genre, darkly funny, but with some intense moments like the kill room sequence & some realistically panicked car fleeing scenes.  Collin Farrell (Daredevil) played a perfect preator, without being campy, We opted not to see it in 3-D, I don't like the effect in dark movies, and Fright 'Night' , hello.

B003YBUSMW|4.0|My love of racing games and the upcoming release of [[ASIN:B003O6E986 Forza 4]] made me decided to pick up an XBOX 360 since it may be a long time before the next version of Gran Turismo comes out. I'm not hardcore enough where I need a cockpit or hyper expensive wheel. I use a [[ASIN:B001D1MG5W Logitech Playstation 3 Driving Force Wireless Force Feedback Wheel]] that sits in your lap and wanted to find the same for my new XBOX. Now MadCatz puts out some pretty poorly reviewed cheap accessories. But I went with the good reviews here and on the forum at GT Planet (which surprisingly has a Forza section). The wheel is well made. I believe its plastic over steel, so it feels very sturdy, much more then my Logitech wheel. Although it doesn't have force feedback, which I thought I would miss, there is enough tension on the wheel that I really don't miss it. For $100 more, MadCatz will have a force feedback version out around when Forza 4 is released in October. The only issue I have is that it sometimes needs to be resynched with the console. That may be because we have more then 1 XBOX in the house. Anyway, I like it so much, I am buying Xbox versions of my racing games I have on PS3, [[ASIN:B00149Y1G0 GRID]], [[ASIN:B001TOMQTY Need For Speed]], [[ASIN:B00488PZ1E Shift 2 - Unleashed]] to go with Xbox exclusives [[ASIN:B004UCXNTY NEW Forza 3 Ultimate X360 (Videogame Software)]][[ASIN:B002I0HD9G Test Drive Unlimited 2]] and [[ASIN:B000UKZ20S Project Gotham Racing 4]].<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Realistic feeling steering wheel<br /><br />sturdy<br /><br />Includes pedals<br /><br />Includes clamp for connecting to a table<br /><br />Long batter life.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />The wheel, since it ships with pedals (which I don't use) maps the paddles as buttons.

1933952806|5.0|Excelent book, as all the ones from Darrel (got the previews Mastering D90). Clear, well explained and very beautifuly ilustrated.  Highly recommended, and worthy.
031603441X|4.0|I loved this book.  The writing style was very informal and readable.  I felt like Keith was talking straight to me.   I grew up with the Stones and spent quite a bit of my youth partying with them in the background.      The best part of the book was the formative days, totally immersed in the American blues and then eventually showing America what it was missing of its own.  Also good stuff about performing and guitar playing specifics - fun stuff.    The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because of the junky (as in heroin) stuff and long-term debauchery.  Not flattering or funny and pretty hard to get through.  Also, the ending was a bit like a Facebook entry -\\"I'm just a regular guy\\" day in the life thing.  But overall, this was a rocking good time and Keith and James Fox really did a great job with structure, pacing, and inserting quotes from other folks.
B00505470O|5.0|I received this book (in great condition) before I could turn around! I am very pleased with Amazon's relationship with used book dealers. I would be unable to connect with those dealers otherwise.

B0055B0MIO|5.0|If you are at all a true fan of trivium, you definitely will not be dissapointed with this album. Or, if you are simply a metal fan, then you will find alot here to enjoy.In my opinion, this is Trivium's best release. In Waves is a blend of all of their previous albums with new elements added to their sound.It has the in your face feel of shogun, combined with the screaming vocals and melodies of ascendancy, also some metallica-esque crusade as well.      Some people who are hardcore death metal fans will be turned off by trivium's slightly more \\"mainstream\\" approach. But,to me its just them maturing with there musical ability.Many bands use that as a lame excuse to justify that they are becoming soft, or getting old and running out of ideas.This is NOT the case by any means. And they ARE NOT in any way selling out like so many other metal bands have in that way.This is the first album with their new drummer and he is an excellent fit.Matt Heafy's vocals are among his best ever, the bass playing is top notch, and cory's leads are as always: amazing.      The album starts with \\"capsizing the sea\\" which is a great build up intro to the title track \\"in waves\\" which is one of the best tracks on the album.My personal favorites are also:\\"built to fall\\",\\"black\\",\\"a grey so dark\\" \\"caustic are the ties that bind\\" and \\"of all these yesterdays\\" which is a simple yet beautiful ballad.some may be turned off that some guitar riffs are easier. But i asure you they havent lost any steam.There are only a few songs on this album that i dont think are \\"great\\" but none are bad by any means. most are blistering. They do step back to their roots with tracks like \\"dusk dismantled\\" which is a pure sonic assult.      Simply put, if you love heaviness, but also love epic melodies, or are a musician (i'm a guitarist which makes it easier to appreciate trivium's musical ability), you will be in for a treat.i suggest picking up the special edition which has an awesome live set in the studio, documentary of making \\"in waves\\", \\"in waves\\" music video and 5 extra tracks on the cd and more.. This album has fantastic musicianship, high production values and polish, coupled with inspiring lyrics.This should certainly be metal album of the year nominee.
1905236042|5.0|I got this set to do yoga with my kids (3 and 7).  I have them choose a few cards and put them together to flow for our own little class.  We have had a lot of fun with this set of cards since it has a unique set of yoga activities to keep everyone interested and having fun.  My older daughter loves doing the partner poses - she will pick all of those out of the deck to do, plus a few others.  The cards show you how to do the partner poses step by step, which helps.  The partner poses can be challenging to do with an adult and child due to the size difference, but my daughter has enjoyed figuring out how to do them with our size difference.  My favorite pose is the double pretzel (easy to do, partner pose, feels great).  These cards are larger than other product offerings, which makes them easy for all to see.
0553801473|5.0|This book is just another couple pieces to the story.  I don't know why other reviewers complain about all their questions being unanswered; Hey, there will be TWO more books in the series! Just enjoy the story and where it's taking you.  Some of my favorite characters were in this book, but GRRM does leave you a few cliffhangers, just like his earlier books.
B003K1EYM6|4.0|I just had a wonderful family vaction to Disney park, and carried this little adapter, along with an iPad 32GB, as opposed to the usual PC.<br /><br />My camera uses a SDHC card, with the adapter, it transfers all the photoes without any problem.<br /><br />However I quickly noticed that it ignored all the video files. Upone a closer look, I discovered that it seems to only recognize .mpg/.mov files, thus turns a blind eye on .mp4 files.<br /><br />This gave me quite a headache as I have filled up the SD card with a lot of MP4 files, and I don't want to delete any of them! Now my  16GB card is basically \\"shrink\\" to a 2GB card. I ended up with the following strategy:<br /><br />1. Change image quality from super fine to good<br />2. Change movie type from AVCHD to MPEG<br />3. Manually break some AVCHD file into smaller pieces and selectivly delete some piece of them, which is frankly a painful process.<br />4. Do a daily transfer of photo/video to the iPad.<br /><br />It worked ok afterwards, and didn't ruin my vacation.<br />So make sure you're aware of its limitations.<br />Otherwise it's a good product.
B005DF2QMC|3.0|This little box works as advertised, but I'm not sure how long it will last.  To start at the beginning, the instructions for Audacity software installation are written in micro print by someone who didn't speak english as a first language, but they work and *are* understandable.  However, the instructions tell you in the Audacity Preferences to set recording device to \\"USB PnP Audio Device\\" from a drop down menu.  I did not have that option, so selected SigmaTel audio, and that works.     The first night I was using it, the fast foward button quit working.  The player has 'auto reverse' (automatically changes direction at the end of a tape), but Reverse is always in the same direction, so depending what side of the tape is playing/being recorded, it could be reverse or fast forward, so it takes a bit to figure out where you are on the tape.       BUT- the program works, and will save out to mp3 or wav files.  I bought this unit because I do not have an ipod and didn't want to buy other units I saw that require the use of itunes.  While the included instructions talk about installing Audacity, they do not do much for explaining how to use the program- how to separate the tracks, how to set levels, no details, and the Help section isn't much help.  It's not too hard to figure out after a while of trial and error and clicking around how to make things work, but a little more explanation on the basic separating and labeling of tracks would be helpful.  Another major point that should have been explained is that the recording level is actually set by the volume wheel on the cassette player, which leaves me wondering what's the point of the gain feature in the Audacity program itself.     Overall, it works to do what it's supposed to do- save my dusty old tapes of collected music to digital format- but the unit seems cheaply made, the door could snap off easily, and I question how long it'll keep going before the reverse or play button also quits.  But for about $20,I shouldn't complain.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book immensely.  Great writer and I couldn't wait to download his next book, \\"Tiz,\\" which I'm just in the middle of now.  Captivating, real, heartbreaking, and told from the heart.  One of the best I've read.

B001GKJ2E8|5.0|This movie has a little bit for everybody. If you like action movies, this has that. I'm generally not even a fan of that type of movie, but I thought the action scenes in this were pretty exciting. The reason I liked this movie as much as I did though, was for reasons totally unrelated. If you like movies with real human emotions, this is it. Much like Fight Club, this movie combines the relatable idea of being uncomfortable in your own skin, with scenes that can be found in a typical action movie. It starts with this guy Wesley Gibson, played by James MacAvoy, whose life is totally ordinary, in all the wrong ways. He hates his job, his girlfriend is cheating on him with his roommate, and he seems to generally just be depressed in general; like he is tired of living his mundane life, and he feels completely insignificant to the world. His life changes when he runs into Fox, played by Angelina Jolie, who greets him in a convenient store with the phrase \\"You apologize too much.\\" Soon, Wesley's life goes from being totally uneventful, to anything but. In the process, he goes from feeling like he means absolutely nothing to anyone in the world, to rising above all of that, and taking the course of his future in his own hands. I don't even want to spoil anything, but the ending is fantastic. This is great as an action movie, and as a drama. This is probably in contention to be one of my favorite movies of the last few years.
0439023521|5.0|This I think is the best series I have read in my life. I read all 3 books in 3 days, it's that good!!  This is not the usual stuff I read (I read romance books) but all I can say is WOW. This book will get   you hooked from start to finish regardless of what you usually read and I'm soon to be 30. There are over 2000  Reviews on this book but I wanted to leave my 2 cents still. I only bought this on my kindle so that my aunt could read it   And what do you know I ended up finishing the series before she even started it. Buy it, you  won't regret it!!
B004MARLJ2|5.0|This game is not for the dumb. That sounds strange. Anyway not for people too inept to read instructions, follow tutorials and/or like thinking games.

B004Y1USV2|4.0|In recent years, the reputation of \\"Drama\\" ,Yes' only previous album without singer Jon Anderson, has been rehabilitated, and the album has found many fans. In many respects, \\"Fly From Here\\" is \\"Drama,Part 2\\". The album reassembles 4 of the 5 members of the \\"Drama\\" line-up(bassist Chris Squire, drummer Alan White, guitarist Steve Howe & keyboardist Geoff Downes), and the 5th \\"Drama\\" member Trevor Horn is involved heavily, not only as producer, but as co-writer of nearly all the songs. These days, Horn is so successful as a record producer, that he has no need or desire to become a touring musician again. Oliver Wakeman, who had been Yes' on stage keyboardist in recent years, has been ousted in favor of bringing back Geoff Downes, so obviously creating another \\"Drama\\", and reuniting the Horn-Downes songwriting team(previously known as the new wave duo \\"The Buggles\\") was the main priority. Still, Oliver Wakeman appears as a sessionman adding some additional keyboards on a few tracks.                              As for singer Benoit David, formerly of a Yes tribute band, his role is merely to sing; not to have creative input(he does have a co-writing credit on one song, probably for modifying an existing lyric). If Mr.David's on stage role is to sound like Jon Anderson, his role in this album is to sound like Trevor Horn....and he does, but better, because Benoit David has a more extensive note range than Horn. David can sound like Trevor Horn in the lower part of his(David's) range, but can reach high notes that would be a strain for Horn to hit. In his other groups, Benoit David has only recently branched out to write a few lyrics. Though he can reportedly play some guitar, he sticks strictly to singing here. He's lucky to be in the same studio with his heroes. And, as for the fact that nearly all of the album's lyrics are by Trevor Horn, it should be explained that though the documentary DVD shows that Benoit David does speak perfect English, he is a French-Canadian, for whom English is a second language.                             As for the songs, the title track is a vintage track from the \\"Drama\\" era which had been performed on stage, but never recorded. Here it is expanded to a 20 minute progressive piece. Musically, the album is not as progressive as the 1972-77 material, but it is not bluntly commercial radio rock like \\"90125\\" or \\"Big Generator\\". Oddly, the one respect in which Jon Anderson is very much missed, is as a lyricist and conceptualiser.                            And if Fans have wondered why Jon Anderson didn't rejoin the group after resting for six months due to respiratory problems, it is because, as with Rick Wakeman(who has heart problems), Anderson's health would not hold up to prolonged international touring. Anderson & Wakeman(both together and separately) still play local gigs in England.                             If it is a choice between \\"Yes\\" continuing with new members, or not continuing, I'm happy that they're continuing. The sound is unmistakably \\"Yes\\". And anyhow, Chris Squire owns the \\"Yes\\" name, and is within his rights to continue the group.
0553805371|5.0|This is probably the most interesting book I have read since... ever. The questions that Stephen Hawking try to answer in this book are probably the most important questions that people have been trying to solve for ages. And he does not use any myth to respond these questions, but just evidence from the latest scientifical theories. Science, or phylosophy, was technically born to solve these questions. As he says at the end of the book, after 3000 years, we might be finally getting to the final answers.    I read other reviews that said that the book is too short. I agree it is short, but I really do not think that making it any larger would make it better. I believe he makes his points very clearly and well explained. Also, his explanations of complex physics theories are very nice and simple, and easy to follow. It does not make you feel frustrated or lost when reading them. He does not get into complicated stuff. The book is very nice and simple to read, as well as fun.  I definitly recommend this book for anyone who is open-minded about the big questions about the universe.

1451629184|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed reading the book. It was painful to read all the abuse Jaycee had to go through. It reminded me of my own abuse, it was like reading  my own sexual abuse word for word, isolated, cut off from the world even today;  like she is my own twin in torture, captivity etc..  It saddens me, that she got so much help from people in state agencies, when  millions of  poor kids & poor adults, foster kids and homeless kids & adults are murdered and abused a lot of horrific acts and no one notices or cares with much apathy..  Which I can boldly testify personally, living in america for 40 years. being  poor and shunned and hated by each 'community'.
B003SI5NX0|5.0|Great Disney movie for the whole family! All my kids loved it... boys and girls. Just wish I could have purchased it as a instant video instead of just renting it!
B003O86CJS|3.0|Teenage Dream is a good CD to listen to.  However, sex seems to be a cloud over  every song Katy Perry sings. I enjoy her singing style, upbeat etc..  I wouldn't recommend it to kids..even though I got the clean version..  It still is disturbing to hear her constant reference to sex acts etc..for me.
0385721234|5.0|I have read more than 1/4 of the book already, and it is amazing! The Spanish version is a little difficult (English is my first language) at first because of all the food jargon, but the book gets much easier to read after about 8 pages into it. Como Agua Para Chocolate is a very enjoyable book.
0307595862|2.0|Yawn. Bought it on the Kindle. A standard thriller that reads like a movie script proposal. Overdone sadism. Didn't care about the characters. I was very disappointed because I just finished all ten of the Swedish Martin Beck novels by Maj Sjowall and Per Walloo which are so rich and textured that I will buy them in paper to keep on my shelf to loan to friends and revisit myself. But I have already deleted The Snowman from my Kindle. Didn't bother to archive it.
B004C2MNS4|4.0|I purchased this set of audio discs for my 14-year old daughter. She completed her required summer reading before entering High School, but we encouraged her to read another book. I've read \\"Into The Wild\\" as a paperback, many years ago, and felt that it might be a challenge for a 14-year old. The discs arrived on time and in very good shape. What's even better, is that my daughter is actually using them. It may lead me to purchase other audio discs in the future, as neither of us are fast readers. Thanks, Amazon.
0553801473|4.0|I had almost decided to give up on this series because it has been so long since Feast for Crows came out, but then HBO did Game of Thrones and I remembered why I loved them so much.<br /><br />The book has some predictable flaws, the foremost of which was created by dividing the book into Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons. If they had come out more swiftly, Martin might have gotten away with writing such an unwieldy set of books. But it is just too hard to remember who many of the characters are. You spend quite a bit of time going, who the hell is this guy?<br /><br />To my surprise, however, I found myself missing some of the people who I had thought I wouldn't (Brianna). And most of the time I didn't much mind if it took me a while to place characters or if I had to go look them up online.<br /><br />I was enjoying the journey. So Martin painted himself into some big writerly corners. Big deal. It's a complicated world he has created and I'm going to stick around until I find out the ultimate fate of Tyrion Lannister, unless I meet my own first. Which is entirely possible given how long it takes Martin to write these things.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|This DVD was purchased for a friend who gives it a 5 star review. Somehow I forgot to order a copy for myself, but will do very soon.
B000I9WW4A|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie and ended up with a copy (recently).  It's an incredible movie about nothing.  Granted, this is one of those \\"drug infused\\" movies but essentially it's more or less about the absurdity of the human condition (at least in the US).  It's certainly not for everyone but it's always good to see a movie like this that calls a spade a spade...even if the movie is filmed through drug tainted lenses.
B004XQO8JG|2.0|First let me say that this film sucks!  I can recall way back when this came out that it was hyped up, released, out of the theaters and then on cable a few months later!  Now anyone from back in the 80's knows that it took a while before films got put on cable - especially the great ones, so for this to be on cable so soon gave me a red flag!    You know, since it's release, I have made serveral attempts to watch this film.  A couple of times on cable upon it's debut and about ten years later on TV.  I guess the turn-offs were every tough guy stereotype in film is in here.  Shades, all black dress, designer gun, does not talk much, is always calm, fearless, brave, works alone, toothpick, self assurance, needs no guns - you name it!  Add to that his 1950's car which was a turn-oof to me because I do not like those cars and what we have here is a film that tries to be cool but fails.    Now, I JUST watched this today!  Yes, it took me this long to watch it.  Every other time I tired, I always left off after the supermarket scene.  I did not know what the film was about up to that point and even after I did not know what it was about.  You have a group of crazed slashers who go around killing and talking about their goals.  Only when you watch it all do you realize what it and they are about!  Thanks to Youtube, we are able to get a better idea of these New World Order sickos and their devilish aims.  Yes, the main antagonist says to Stallone: \\"Do you want to go to hell with me?\\"  He also adds:\\"We kill the weak so that the strong survive!\\"  He also said something about the \\"new order.\\"  So without fully explaining the killer's reason for killing, this kind of sums it up.  At the time of it's release, I doubt that anyone would have a clue as to what was going on, many would not today.  ONLY in this context does this film have any cohesiveness to it.    On a story note.  Bridgette Nilsson barley saw the killer and they wanted to remain secret, but they blow their entirecover to kill someone that barely saw them?  They would have been better off not trying to kill her as she could not pinpoint anyone!  So this film is good a pointing out the NWO theme in film yet again.  I am guessing that this sick cult of madness must be real!  President Bush I made it public when he announced a New World Order and Michael Paine (husband of Ruth Paine of JFK assassination lore) also said that he and Lee Harvey Oswald were trying to accomplish a new world order!
B005BGBPBG|4.0|One of my favorite romantic comedies! Good actors and actresses, great story line, full of laughs, and tears. Perfect romantic comedy!
B00005RDRO|5.0|MURDER by DEATH is a very refreshing movie to watch and very funny. It is a classic!!! The actors are all fantastic and the idea for this type of movie is very interesting. Just a great movie over all.....from actors to plot.
1451629184|5.0|At first, I had a hard time reading this book.  She did a wonderful job sharing with me her reader what she endured at the hands of this crazy man.    It is a real eye opener story to how the legal system let her down.  It is my understanding things have changed since she and her daughters were reunited with her mother.  I know it is her journey now to help others in the same situation as she was.  The one thing that she always held onto was HOPE.    She makes me proud to see that she never allowed complete control of her mind and that she was able to remember who her real mother was.    I appreciate Jaycee coming forward with her kidnapping and subsequent raping by this monster.  He not only raped her physically but mentally as well.  I am angry by the fact that she had to endure this for so long and how our legal system failed her.    She is a very beautiful strong woman who now can live free of the abuse of her kidnapper with the love and support from her  family, friends, and community.    Thank You Jaycee for sharing your story.      God Bless you and your family.  You are well loved!
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Review no. 216. Took me awhile to land a copy of this stellar first CD by Wolfmother - the (seemingly) premier 21st century Australian alternative metal trio. Key tracks here include \\"Dimension\\", the power-house \\"White Unicorn\\", \\"Joker And A Thief\\", \\"Pyramid\\", the total ass-kicking \\"Witchcraft\\" and somewhat 'funky' \\"Love Train\\". Personnel: Andrew Stockdale - guitar & vocals, Chris Ross - bass & keyboards and Myles Heskett - drums. Band's obvious influences are Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, MC5 and Kyuss. Long time / serious fans of Mastodon, Monster Magnet maybe Soungarden, Boris and Ozzy-era Black Sabbath will likely eat this title up. I wasn't aware that Wolfmother had just two CD's out, as I haven't heard 'Cosmic Egg' yet. Highly recommended.
B0049UHKVY|5.0|Seventh Wonder - The Great Escape is quite simply my favorite album from 2010, and maybe one of my favorite rock albums of all time.    Seventh Wonder is a progressive metal/hard rock group from Sweden along the lines of Dream Theater, but they have the songwriting/melody abilities of, say, a band like Sonata Arctica. The melodies from the songs stick with you afterwards and you find yourself humming along....something many 'shred' bands fail at, but not Seventh Wonder.    Singer Tommy Karevik has one of the best set of pipes in the business at the moment, crystal clear singing but with a bit of soulful gymnastics to it, yet not sounding like a faux-opera singer like some people hate. All I can think of for a comparison is the late Brad Delp (Boston) but with soul (and not quite as high-pitched).    Bass player Andreas Blomqvist is one of prog metals best too, right up there with John Myung of Dream Theater, etc. And you can actually hear Andreas' bass in the mix quite well, not buried like with some bands.....    Guitarist Johan Liefvendahl is great too, maybe not quite the shredder that John Petrucci of Dream Theater or Michael Romeo of Symphony X etc. is, but he does shred, and very well, yet very melodic at the same time. Good, good stuff from Johan.    Excellent keyboards and drums too, from Andreas Soderin and Johnny Sandin, respectively.      I can't say enough about how much I love this album. It easily makes my 'Desert Island list' (10 albums you'd like to have if you were stranded on a deserted island, and had a way of listening to them). Right up there with Dream Theater - Images And Words, Symphony X - The Odyssey, Kansas - Leftoverture, Porcupine Tree - Deadwing, etc.
B000065V41|5.0|While I just finished wacthig it for the 1st time in 15+ years. MCC is a very enterning take on Charles Dickens' classic. I honestly and truely think that Jim Henson would be proud of his boy Brian's work on this film.
0140277447|5.0|You may be put off by the idea of the word RAPE being in giant capital letters on the front of your book, especially if you want to read it in public.  I assure you that once you get into the book you'll want people to see that and you'll want them to ask you about it.  The content in this book has been forgotten and neglected by the US public school system and perhaps the western world in general.  You will be shocked by the graphic photos and depictions in this book, but it's something much too significant to be left swept under the rug.  I read this book for a college course, I kept it and still read it because it needs to be read.  Subjective history.
B000002KHF|5.0|Moondance by Van Morrison is awesome.  Mystic River brings back so many memories. Great CD. This is a great one for a collection if you love Van Morrison.
0545259088|5.0|I've read the whole series!! And it was amazing!! Not only does the other 2 leave you wanting to know more but the 3rd does the same!! The ending was one that leaves you guessing, but as a reader I continued my own story! This series and book is a wonderful read!! It's a refreshing read too.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard has helped me and my girlfriend. I was not a big fan of htc&apos;s keyboard. I would recommend it to anyone.
0545259088|3.0|It leaves you wanting more which would be fine if it wasn't the last book. I enjoyed the trilogy but at the end didn't really feel like I got an actual end. It just stops without giving any real answers as to what becomes of the characters.
0345529057|3.0|Very pleased with speed with which order was received. However, before my son was finished with the first book, the cover had completely separated from the binding. He is a careful reader, never bends the cover back and puts each book back in the box when not reading it. We both were quite disappointed.
B005HED5YW|5.0|If one watches the credits... it is amazing the number of stars that got their start on this show. Is is cheesy ? It is really cheesy with extra cheese and that is what makes it fun to watch even today.
B000002UW1|5.0|REM here takes a Quantum Leap in songwriting, lyrics, melodicism etc. and produce their probable best effort as their swan song for IRS.  \\"It's the End of the World As We Know It\\" is a masterpiece of lyric, structure, harmony and even melody, as well as the integration of all of the above.  People focus on \\"End of the World\\" as a lyrical masterpiece, overlooking the marvelous way those lyrics are enhanced by the chords, rhythm, and melody.  All in all, it's one of the seminal achievements in all, and I mean ALL music.    The rest of the record is strong enough to be a four or five star record without its best song!  The haunting \\"The One I Love\\" answers the rapid-fire lyrical barrage of \\"End of the World\\" with three iterations of the a single verse, and the famous one-word chorus of \\"Fire!\\"; and its minimal simplicity is just as effective, if less groundbreaking.    The album tracks in themselves make up a four-star record with their relentless power, originality, melodicism, inventiveness, musicianship (who would have thought I would come away from an REM record impressed with raw musicianship!) and overall excellence.  Some, of course, are better than others, but Finest Worksong, Welcome to the Occupation, Exhuming McCarthy, Strange (a cover), Disturbance at the Heron House, Fireplace, and Lightnin' Hopkins are just as fine a set of tracks as has ever graced a record. \\"King of Birds\\" and \\"Oddfellows Local 151\\" I would say stand just below, suffering from REM's tendency to get a little over-earnest with their concept and lyrics.    This is a gem.  Listen to it however you can.
B003Y5H542|3.0|Note: This is NOT a movie suitable for young children.    The music and animation were fantastic, and there were a couple of moments in the film that deserved a chuckle. However, I had the feeling that the writers were trying too hard to make the movie edgy enough to attract adult viewers. I could have done without the four letter words, semi-gruesome imagery, and the jokes about mammograms and prostates. I mean, really?
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Paul is an enjoyable comedy/alien film from the minds of Shaun Of The Dead. There are indeed some parts that are stupid, and some objectionable material. But overall it's a fairly good movie worth a watch. Are there things that might offend religious people, yes. But they have been offending intelligent people for centuries. Anyone can sit down and write a good fiction Book. This is relatively good sci-fi. Watch and enjoy.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Nice and loud, and I love how it makes me math to shut it up. In all of my years, I have managed to sleep through every alarm clock I&apos;ve owned. Except one this one. A perfect alarm application for heavy sleepers like me.
B00104W8T6|4.0|It is a great cd .... It's the type of cd you have to be in a certain mood for.
B0042L78MG|5.0|Excellent album . I heard the title track on the radio - liked it so bought the album. Wasn't disappointed.
B004YXE438|5.0|If you are a puzzle lover, then this is a great app.  You can make the puzzle as challenging as you want, and I like the ability to use custom images too.  It's helpful that when you finally get the correct piece in the right place and orientation, it locks it in place.  Otherwise, I think I would still be trying to get one of the harder puzzles done.  When you need to kill a few minutes while waiting, fun app to use.
B004SGWYW4|3.0|High School of the Dead, Is a about a virus turning people into zombie's. The usual thing that happens when zombie's are in anime.  What I really like about this anime is the adrenaline and fear you can feel while watching this anime. But I give it a three-star is cause i felt as if something was lacking   in the story. Be aware though lot's and lot's and lot's of fan service I meant this anime should be rated R if it isn't. Some of the characters are surprising and some are a total cliche. Like the nurse. Also I don't know if there is gonna be a second season or not but If you buy this you're gonna hope for another season cause the ending leaves you hanging.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|Why did I pay for this when it lags so bad. What&apos;s the point of having a dual core processor. please fix this.
B00005NB8K|3.0|This film does more than scratch the surface regarding the band The Doors. However, it is far from comprehensive. The fact that some fiction was applied to the film was a bit disappointing. The heavy focus on Jim Morrison caused the other band members to be distant. It is essential viewing for any true Doors fan, but I have found books on this subject to be more informative. The film is reasonably entertaining, and the special edition interviews are good viewing.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Functions well, enough options to keep me busy. I also like the dictionary feature. Too bad it doesn&apos;t hook into my booklending.com account... Do that and I&apos;d up my rating to 5 stars.
B004LWZWE2|5.0|It's AC/DC, how can you possibly go wrong?  My VHS copy was getting worn out and it's amazing that they finally remastered and released this classic concert DVD.<br /><br />If you like AC/DC even just a little bit you'll love this DVD.<br /><br />We miss you Bon Scott!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|Written in very short sentences that make for a tense, gripping story. Jack Reacher is a hero you can cheer for in spite of his ruthlessness (against those who deserve it).     However, the story dragged a bit in the middle of the book (maybe it should have been shorter), Reacher was always making accurate guesses based on insufficient data and the plot depended on several absolutely incredible coincidences.
B001AQT11M|5.0|This DVD is in great shape. It came wrapped and sealed tight. My daughter loves this movie. I would reccommend this to everyone.
0374532281|5.0|I bought this book for one reason. Because it was going to become a movie directed by David O Russell and starring Mark Wahlberg and Robert De Niro (Wahlberg has dropped out at this point). But let me tell you, I was pleasantly surprised on how good of a book this was. I usually read at night before I go to sleep, and at that time only. And I usually finish a book in 2-3 weeks, but with The Silver Linings Playbook, I was glued to it. I read it in two days. Can't wait for the movie, and you bet I will be checking out Matthew Quick's other works!
B00003CXB4|5.0|Thjis DVD was said to be used and it came wrapped tight and in great condition. My daughter loves this movie and it was a great addition to our Disney Collection.
0316098329|5.0|I really appreciated the quality of the book, the response time and the price.  I really got what I expected and more.
0788859544|5.0|The movie is in perfect condition and my daughter Wilder loves it! The delivery was spot on and everything was great. I would recomend Amazon to anyone who had a child who has a lot of Disney Needs lol
B000FFJYCU|5.0|Love looking at it. So real, the way the script went into every ones lives. Love the scenary. The ending was so sad. But what is life.
030788743X|5.0|All the reviews have said it, so I'll just chime in and say fabulous work that focuses on those of us from the 80s who watched the video game universe spawn and grow. Should be required reading for anyone <25 yrs old who thinks the first video game was WoW
B000001EHS|5.0|Been a fan of Def Leppard for years. Have a DVD of them when they were young and just starting out. I love the Best of and the CD
B004HWT6DO|1.0|When I saw the huge propaganda for this movie, and when I saw its 4-star rating on TV, I thought I am going to watch a classic. When I did watch the movie I was shocked. It started with a 15-minute boring dialogue between two bad actors and the boredom kept increasing with every scene. I gave it one star because there is no zero stars to rate a movie. I can say with confident that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Bad story, very bad actors, very weak scenario. I regretted that I wasted my time watching such a stupid movie.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I listen to the CD all the time. I can remenber when it first came out. Just feel young and in college.
B005EI86JU|5.0|[[ASIN:1933952806 Mastering the Nikon D7000]]I have been waiting for delivery of Darrell's latest contribution to Nikon literature.  I am not disappointed.  I am a Nikonian from my film days to my D70 and now the D7000.  I bought the camera in January and have been learning slowly its many functions.  This book will save new users months of learning time.  I have only had the book for three hours but my excitement with what I have seen so far prompted this initial response. The organization of the contents is far superior to the users manual. I am happy and I believe you will be too.
B004A8ZX28|2.0|We pitched it after 10 minutes. Loved the previous movie - Taken. It was both exciting and believable, but the setup on in this script was just unbelievable. If you have been married for some time you can recognize your wife, and she is not going to deny knowing you. You would also know if she had an evil twin sister.  It was simply unacceptable.
1933952806|5.0|This book is the perfect companion for your powerfull Nikon D7000!! I own a couple of other guides, and neither gives the in-depth yet ease of understanding that this book provides. Moreover, it has a great chapter on the Nioon CLS that, alone, is worth a million buckes in pearls of wisdom.  Don't hesitate, you wont be disapointed!!
B0002CX4RM|1.0|Levine in the pit and Domingo celebrating 30 years at the Met while equalling Caruso's record of 17 consecutive opening nights:  What could possibly go wrong?         Ah, those ugly, drab, sets!  And those stupid costumes!  And the hands!  The hands!  True, this production is not as idiotic as most Rings, and the overall presentation is ALMOST somewhat reminiscent of ye olde Gaza.  But the overall effect was annoying enough to wreck the entire concept.      I have never heard the Met orchestra sound more lethargic and uninterested.  And the staging was as clumsy as could be.  For example, the Israelite's rebellion--or whatever it was in Act I--couldn't have been any cornier if the dragon from \\"Siegfried\\" dropped in for a cameo, and the bacchanal could have used a massive injection of Viagra.  At least the destruction of Dagon's temple was accomplished in record time.  (About three seconds by my reckoning.)      Bottom line:  if you are looking for a traditional staging of this opera, keep looking.
B000X1N440|5.0|Everyone who hopes to write text in the English language needs to read this book. I don't agree with all of her conventions, especially omitting the serial comma before '&' from the book's title, but it is a worthy effort and very readable.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|What can I say. My all-time favorite movie being presented in its ultimate form!!  I well remember seeing this movie when it was first released, going to Lincon Road Theatre in Miami Beach. After seeing this Blu Ray version, I think it looks even better now.  WOW!!!   Now if I can only get my grandchildren to learn to love these songs as I do!!
006056251X|1.0|I thought this book was so formula and boring I could not wait for it to end. When I finished it I was very glad. Ridiculous formula and predictable plot. I don't understand why there are 4 and 5 star reviews for this garbage. Trashy regency with no compelling characters and very flimsy plot.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|The quality was great playing on my PS3. This is one of my favorite movies; I intended to watch it in the background but just had to sit down and watch the whole thing.
0439023521|5.0|This book was so good that I couldn't put it down. Humanity is in shambles but, the underdog lives to tell a great tale. You will thoroughly enjoy this book. The what-ifs of this tale really make you wonder. Hhhmmm, what would you do?
B001N1DPDE|5.0|I bought this knife because I wanted a knife I could take with me in the woods and not have to worry about breakage. And let's just say this knife does not dissapoint! I give this knife 5 stars because it is a HOSS of a knife. It has a great feel in my hand and feels very secure. The the sheath on the other hand could have been designed a little better because of the flimsy belt loop, but I bought this because of the knife not the sheath. This is a knife I will take with me on any camping trip I take, and one I can trust my life with in a survival situation. All in all, If your looking for a knife you can smash/cut/chop/hack anything your heart desires...get this knife.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|In the opening scene of Social Network we eavesdrop on a conversation between Mark Zuckerberg (Jesse Eisenberg) and his girlfriend. At the end of the scene Mark's now ex-girlfriend sums up his treatment of people in a succinct statement. She told him that he would probably do something big and complain that girls didn't like him because he was a nerd. She went on to say that this was a lie. That girls wouldn't like him because he was an a-hole. He went on to make the last part of the prediction true by drogging (drunk blogging) and starting a demeaning girl comparison website that very night.<br /><br />The first part of the prediction took a little longer.<br /><br />This is a look at why and how the monster Facebook was started, and reveals the players, the greed, the conniving and the strategy that has made it the thing that it is. And it reveals some of the consequences and the cost of doing business with those who play for keeps. Part legal \\"thriller\\", part \\"documentary\\", part psychological study this film is a fascinating look at a man and his intense mind. I don't know that you could mindlessly watch it and enjoy it because it's not mere entertainment. I found it an interesting reflection of what the downside of social media has really become...for some a platform, for others \\"relationships\\" that appear real, for others an efficient way to disembowel enemies without all the mess.
B00000JNO1|5.0|I bought the vinyl when it was released in 75,(I think?) It was well worn, and it has been misplaced. I'm finally replacing it. This album likely ain't for everyone? To my ears it's a gem. \\"On The Hunt\\" production is outstanding, those guitars sound better than ever. \\"Am I Losin\\" is another favorite with excellent sound too. \\"Saturday Night Special\\" is likely my least favored, but the most recognized track on the album.

B004LWZW4M|5.0|Rise of the Planet of the Apes is everything the critics have said--and much more. Yes, it is a tour-de-force performance by Andy Serkis, and is a masterpiece of motion-capture CGI effects work. The film pays homage to the Charlton Heston original, and the descending quality films that followed it. But there is a much more powerful message beneath all that: the plight of apes and other animals humans use for experiments, entertainment, and zoos. There is also a message about what happens to these  beings when they are no longer \\"cute,\\" and become what they really were to begin with.<br /><br />The thing that gets you about \\"Rise\\" is when you look into their eyes, and it's not just Caesar, the central character and real star of the film. Go to one of the several websites for chimpanzee sanctuaries, and look at the photographs of the many, many animals that have been rescued from laboratories. On many of them you will see the exact same look of suffering so realistically portrayed in the film. \\"Rise\\" is supposed to be science fiction and entertainment, but this part of it was taken from something that is REAL, and is happening as I write this review. The fact is that chimpanzees, gorillas, bonobos, and orangutans have been subjected to almost exactly what is seen in this film for many decades.<br /><br />The makers of this film are to be commended for using CGI instead of trained Great Apes. Many people around the world have little idea that the cute chimps used in many television commercials are youngsters less than 5 years old. They also have no idea what happens to them when they become adults. Most often they are disposed of by putting them into labs or sanctuaries, living out their remaining days in cages. \\"Rise\\" hits home there too. The recent episode of the woman whose face and hands were literally torn off by a \\"pet\\" chimp shows how wrong human perceptions of these intelligent creatures can be.<br /><br />In every instance, the Great Ape species are losing the battle for survival in the places where they really belong: in the wild. Meanwhile, thousands of them languish in captivity to serve the needs of humans: medical, entertainment, and so forth. If \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" does anything beyond just entertainment, perhaps it will reflect a mirror on the humans who see it--and perhaps illuminate us to who the real \\"animals\\" are. \\"Rise\\" is actually an allegory, if only we in our self-exalted position of Masters of the Earth are smart enough to see it.the places where they really belong: in the wild.

B004LWZVZC|4.0|When we hear or learn about Lincoln's assassination we don't hear much of what came before or after. We hear that Boothe got cooked in a barn when they found him but not much more unless you dig deeper. Frankly, I didn't even know that the V.P. Johnson and Secretary of State Seward were also targets but there you have it.     In Redford's film much of the story is fleshed out with particular attention to the trial of Mary Surrat as a conspirator in the proceedings. Great attention is paid to detail. The viewer gets a good idea of the socio-political atmosphere prevalent at the time. Nice attention is also paid to the technical details. Clothing, architecture and procedure all add to the whole. It's an interesting story and it plays the card of James McAvoy as Mary's lawyer who, in the beginning, didn't even want the gig, but ends up going above and beyond to prove her innocence.     This IS a good movie but it could have been better. Maybe a lot better. There is something flat about it. It needed more umph. And there is a lot of wasted talent. Norman Reedus, Kevin Klein and John Cullum didn't need to be there. Their small parts didn't require their significant talent. Even Colm Meaney, Tom Wilkinson and Danny Huston needed many more lines than they got. And Justin Long and Alexis Bledel were miscast. I simply couldn't see them in a period piece and I can't say they were all that great. But this is still a good movie overall. It's enlightening if nothing else. So if you're into historical dramas. this is not at all a bad view.
0451169514|5.0|While King and many readers consider his DARK TOWER series to be his magnum opus, IT, THE STAND and THE SHINING are 3 of the most underappreciated American novels of the post-WWII era.  IT conveys horror on levels not fully realized except in works by Poe and Lovecraft, who didn't live long enough to see the impact of their darkest imaginings.  But what no one can really gather from a book often given the too-brief synopsis of \\"A killer clown terrorizes children...\\" is that this story culminates in a fantastically creative split-time (50s/80s) climax written in a way that makes aspiring writers wants to pour water on their laptops and start over with crayons.  IT captures nuances of modern American (well, pre-9/11 at least) folklore and sociocultural standards magnificently, while driving home points about the unfortunate loss of perspective that comes from growing up and leaving your childhood behind.  The resonating fact when all the clowns, aliens, spiders, and bullies have been neutralized (for the time being) is that although time will help you forget the past, yours is the choice between accepting the loss, or fighting to remember how things once were and using memories to make the present just as beautiful as the oft-idealized past.
B004EQAVHI|4.0|I am admittedly unfamiliar with Kazuo Ishiguro's acclaimed best-selling novel, \\"Never Let Me Go\\", I was simply in a dull mood and state of mind, one summer afternoon, turned on the television, and there it was. And I can honestly say, having watched (mostly for reviewing purposes) the majority of gory horror films released in the past decade, or so. I never have, or maybe it's just been a very long time since I've seen a film as utterly screwed-up and disturbing as \\"Never Let Me Go\\".    There is no physical violence in this film, as there are no dark and ominous scary orchestra crescendos, when a teenage character opens the door that they aren't supposed to. But its themes are horrifying, yet it's also deeply depressing, and moving. It finds a weird, but interesting middle-ground between drama, horror, and romance, with science fiction-y elements.    \\"Never Let Me Go\\" is set in an alternate reality where, in the 1970s, the common life expectancy passes 100, and human cloning is a reality. It's about a group of children, Kathy, Ruth and Tommy (Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley, and Andrew Garfield, respectively) who attend an English boarding school called Hailsham, which, is filled with seemingly normal boys and girls. Although, pretty early on, is clear that it's not a normal boarding school, and these are not normal boys and girls. It is revealed that these children are clones, conceived to eventually donate vital organs to \\"real\\" people. It is planned for them, that, beginning in their twenties, they are to give donations, one after the other, until, well, you know.    The heart of it lies with the three lead characters. It follows Kathy, Ruth and Tommy from their childhoods, into their teenage years, where they discover what being a real person is like, and get their first taste of freedom. Carey Mulligan was nominated for an Oscar for her first real performance, in \\"An Education\\". She does a better job here, than there, pulling off the dreary, yet, somehow hopeful demeanor of Kathy, as Keira Knightley pulls off the flighty and lovelorn Ruth, but she can't hold a candle to Mulligan. I saw Andrew Garfield in \\"The Social Network\\", which was made after this film. He didn't really leave an impression on me in that movie. He adds to the atmosphere, in this one. The story wouldn't work without these characters. The three leads are pulled off so well, it made this viewer dread their obvious fates and (mis)fortunes.     I came into this film knowing almost nothing about it. I knew it was based on a very popular novel, and that it was critically described to be quite strange. It piqued my interest in a way that a lot of things do. I hear that it's a pittance, compared to the apparently superior novel, which I'll eventually have to get around to. It paints such a bleak and sorrowful picture of the dystopian society where it takes place, which it was clearly going for, yet it has undeniably gorgeous landscapes and backdrops. Cinematically, it's done in kind of a Sofia Coppola-esque way. And plus It's acted well enough to make you feel for its characters, and it has a romantic aspect which you don't expect. It's multi-layered enough, to make a decent film, however it feels distant and cold, and tends to shy away from the heavy emotional narrative. I hear the book is one where the emotional impact creeps up on its reader, and even though the theme is grim, the film's wide scope and gorgeous backdrops give you a dreamlike vibe, and gives you the idea that a character is going to wake up and snap back into a better, more hopeful world. Aside from the last five or ten minutes, it decides to shy away from the heavy emotional issue at hand, which hurts it, in my opinion. Because of this, and other contributing factors, it isn't a movie that will resonate for every audience. Some may not care enough to look into it, and discover what it's made of. But when you do, that's when it resonates. And I really should get the damn book out of the library.    Grade: B
B004EPYZUI|5.0|At first I didn't like this movie which was a real disappointment since I am big fan of Zach Snyders other work. Howver I have watched it multiple times and I like it more each time I watch it.

When you watch these old 1966 shows, look for the show's futuristic technology that is now part of everyday life i.e. Trek computer with face to face communication - now: computers and phones with skype or facetime, Trek communicators - now: cell phones, Trek Uhura's communication device - now: bluetooth earpiece, Trek pads with stylus - now: ipads. Wow!

B00005JKLZ|5.0|We have been watching this movie for years on VHS so it was a logical choice to add to our DVD collection. Waited to find it in the $5 bin but could wait no longer so we purchased it used on Amazon for a lower price yet.
159420229X|5.0|A new non-fiction opens the fascinating, creative world of memorisation.    ---    This happens to all of us: You catch a news headline about someone in Britian recalling 1,528 randomised digits in an hour, smashing some previous smaller-but-still-ridiculous world record.  The feat is impressive, but it's also so odd, and this person (who's name you've forgotten) is so oddly talented against your own hopeless memory, that rather than feel inspired from the results of disciplined technique and practice, you shrug your shoulders and reaffirm that the world's an odd place.   This is how we feel about 'rain man' characters who recite the 4th power of 5491, and it's how we'd feel about those who accomplish bizarre mnemonic feats on their memory competition circuits/circuses.     As 'Moonwalking with Einstein' begins, Joshua Foer was an ordinary science journalist when he first stumbled across one of these competitions, where a small community gathers to memorise decks of cards, new poems, and other such trivia in a little amount of time. It turns out (as Josh discovers) that the same techniques these freakish talents depend on have a fascinating ancient history behind them - in fact, from the era of Aristotle to Benjamin Franklin, using 'memory palaces' to store mundane information in creative 'memorable' ways was critical to a classical education, an education that's now forgotten so to speak (particularly outside of Europe).    As the book continues in the fashion of any great 'creative non-fiction' page-turner, Josh's objective research and interviews become more involved, and a journalist's professional investigation becomes a personal tale; gradually, the personalities behind this cult scene are becoming Josh's friends; and incredibly, Josh is actually breaking into the techniques and gearing for competition himself, with inspiring results.  This is a hugely important book in the age of gps navigation and smart phone to-do lists, and hugely recommended; 5 stars.

B004YEJGEO|5.0|OK look, everyone is going to have their own idea of what a great puzzle game is like.  I dl&apos;d this gave a few weeks agow and all I can say is awsome!  I really like it. There are a HUGE number of puzzles and it keeps introducing new &apos;tricks&apos; as you progress to keep it interesting. I play this during broing times (waiting for my tires to be rotated, doctor&apos;s office, etc.), here and there for 10 or 20 minutes at a time.  Its perfect for me in situations like that.  It&apos;s better than watching old TV shows for sure!

I am taking U.S. history and John Roulf and Pocahontaus end up together and real life that's why they end up together in the movie. Also John Smith and Pocahontus never really had a real romance. Anyways I remember watching the movie and loving the fun colors and songs and jokes, everyone else is obviously to adult and stubborn to except change in a movie. I do not care what anyone says, I think this is a great movie and I was happy with it. -MVM(:

0452289963|5.0|I bought this book during Oprah's simulcast /skype lecture series with Eckhart Tolle, and found it to be a helpful and enlightening book.  I bought it hoping to help clarify career goals after I burned out hard from my last 50-60 hour a week job.  That's not the focus of this book, and it didn't help me figure out what to do with my life.  However, it helped me to be happy with the life I have, and to learn that whatever I'm supposed to be doing, I'm doing it now.  If you are interested in living a more peaceful and drama-free existence, this book may be of help to you, and I would recommend it.
B003UESJH4|1.0|I agree with the excellent reviews of Literary Architect and Cabir Marc Davis.    This movie could easily have been a much better movie. As it stands it is not worthy of an academy award.    Some \\"historical facts\\" in this movie are wrong. For example the Prime Minister did not resign when war broke out in 1939: he resigned after the defeat of Dunkirk. I think it was in April or May 1940. There are other errors.    I have heard the King speak. He spoke very slowly without stuttering as would anyone else who had his speech impediment. In the movie the  \\"King\\" spoke normally. The actor should have been trained to speak as the King actually spoke.
0785134352|4.0|Great book! It's a fun ride, and is exactly what a comic book should be. The art, and story are great.

B004XE0P5E|5.0|Bon Iver's new album comes with a different sound than did the first album. But, I am intrigued by the new direction and the ability of Justin and Bon Iver to re-invent themselves and thier sound, and yet still be so completely unique. To me, it's the mark of genius. This is a great album. Halocene is haunting, but Perth and Calgary are my other faves on this album.     Heather
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This is an awesome zombie series. It has gore,yes, but also is well-scripted with a good plot and subplots. Special effects are extremely professional with no amateurish CGI like many sci-fi TV productions seem to have. You'll be \\"dying\\" to see the next season!
1594202842|5.0|I don't understand all the haters. You might not agree with her methods, but her results are pretty inarguable - two seemingly well-adjusted, polite, successful, self-possessed, and talented daughters.    Results and methods aside, this book is first and foremost a memoir, not a how-to book. Chua's a good writer, the narrative flows well, and the book is an easy, entertaining, edifying read.    We love to laud Olympic champions, musical prodigies, and professional sports stars...behind almost all of them is a 'tyrannical' parent who drove them to practice constantly from an early age, presumably much as Chua did with her daughters.
0307477479|5.0|I am predisposed against award winning, Pulitzer novels. My fear is that they are always political and hopelessly inaccessible. (Think Dorris Lessing) I am so glad I read this book despite its award winning status.  It reminded me of Jonathan Franzen's Freedom, which I loved, only this book was so much richer, more layered and complex, and more true to life, that it makes Freedom look like an amateur effort.      A Visit from the Goon Squad is a made up of many stories within a story.  Across time and space, people with seemingly little in common are joined by a 6 degrees of separation type of narrative.  What makes this novel so heartbreakingly realistic, so exquisitely true, is that there are no clear, easy answers and resoltions.  Some characters have clear roadmaps, and the reader gets a glimpse of what happens to them. Others, as in life, slip away teasingly, leaving you wondering anxiously where they have gone and what became of them. (And what could be a better mark of a good book?)      Music, punk music specifically, is the only real thread that combines the many characters in this novel.  Music becomes a vehicle for so many issues- what is it to be authentic? To be a sell out? A rebel? A leader?  Music functions as an escape, a tool of communication, a weapon, a way to make a buck. Characters seem unlikable, until they demonstrate with wonderful subtley and grace, that there is always a reason, always a context, always a demon to be outrun. All that connects them is Time, which has a cruel way of stripping people of their youth, vitality, and dignity, but also binds us together through shared experience.  There really isn't a coherent plot here, and the novel is better for it.  There is only struggling, sinking, striving human beings with differing abilities to thrive and maneuver the onslaughts of that goon, Time.      Do yourselves a favor.  Read this book, now, and with an open mind.

We must have watched Rio a dozen times in the first week we purchased it and I have not been annoyed in the least, actually look forward to it.  Now I can enjoy the music while in the car, excellent soundtrack!!
0553582038|1.0|I was warned that the main characters do not appear in it but I had already purchased the set. The first three were good reads but at times switching between so many \\"main\\" characters can be distracting. At least in the first three the characters were not that bad to read about. In this Arya but in the end she just seemed a lost distraction leading away from what I felt was the story I was following. Jaime in the end became the best to read about though by far other characters in the previous books were more enjoyable.    This book could easily have been accomplished in a three chapter prologue skipping many dull details. This looks to me to be more boring Jordan'esk ramblings to continue on a story that author appears to know the end game but doesn't know how to get their quickly enough. This book is so sad when first showed promise. One word should be taught to them, trilogy.
B004P96WJ0|5.0|Mahler along with Wagner, are two composers that you must done have some reading about their lives, as then you will obtain a better understanding of their music.I suggest 'Mahler, a life' by Jonathan Carr. It is not a weighty tome,but destroys some of the myths surrounding Mahler,and 'Mahler an Introduction to his music'by Deryck Cooke, obtained from Amazon.    Mahler's parents were ill suited, but it producted 14 children,of whom only seven survived. Much has been made about the fact that this had an effect upon Mahler. But the death rate when he was born in 1860 amongest infants were high.He grew up in Iglau,Moravia,near a military barracks, with its trumpet sounds, and bands, dance tunes in the town on Saturday nights and regional folk music. Nearby was the countryside, which became a refuge for him. Bernard Mahler, his father, noticed Gustav's musical talent, for he himself was attempting to better himself intellectually.He obtained a music teacher and eventually Gustav entered the Vienna conservatory. Later on Mahler became conductor and director of the Vienna Court orchestra from 1897-1907. In 1902 he married Alma, who was years younger then he. She wanted to be his muse. He told her bluntly that she must give up her composing for him.She mixed in a artistic circle and was their pin up girl.Her parents and step father were artistic. Unfortunately, she was not as intelligent as she thought. Her books about her life with Mahler are to be taken lightly. He was a difficult man, but self sufficent, and would compose alone in a hut.She got her revenge in her memoirs.    Parts of his Seventh symphony influenced Webern,Berg and Schonberg.Although Mahler did not understand  Schonbergs music he supported him in every way he could, including giving him money. It is thought if Mahler had not  died in his early 50's in 1911, he would have ended up coming to the same musical conclusions as Schonberg. Along with Wagner, Mahler believed in reincarnation and there is much evidence to support this.In the Third Symphony he thought he had discovered the secret of creation. The sounds he produces in his symphonies, the bugle calls, marches,walzes, mundane music distorted, also the sounds of nature, must have seemed like Birtwhistle, or Nono does to modern audiences when first heard. You may have noticed that after a disjointed movement,he places a adagio and so forth. It is  thought that the mundane and the spiritual in the music,are caused by the gentleness of his mother, whom he adored and the ambitious down to earth father.Mahlers music was not just about himself, but the world, and the quest for answers of a philosophical nature.    I think together, Solti conducting of the Mahler Symphonies, with the Chicago Symphony orchestra on CD, along with the Bernstein recordings on DVD, have fast tempi, which Mahler prefered.Both bring out the rawness and so called vulgarity,and Bernstein the emotionalism. I think Tennstedt is better when he is conducting alive, as in the DVD's of the Ist and 8th Symphonies, then in a studio. Haitink 6th Movement, of the Third Symphony,captures the spiritual beauty of that movement. But he is too polite and plays down aspects of Mahler. The songs, you cannot go past Janet Baker with John Barbirolli.However, Das Lied von der Erde,there is Klemperer's version, with Ludwig and Wunderlich,Ferrier and Patzak, Vienna Phil,cond Bruno Walter.1952, and Kerstin Thorborg,Kullmann,cond Walter, Vienna Phil,1938. The very first recording.Dutton. Both Walter and Klemperer, who knew Mahler well, both conducted his work differently.    After such a lengthy introduction,I will give my opinion on the seven Mahler symphonies.Claudio Abbado's tempi are fast. They are played differently to the Solti and Bernstein recordings. He down plays the rawness and vulgar sounds deliberately, so you can hear the music clearly, for his textures are light. It is as if the lens has been cleansed and I can see anew. The Lucerne Festival Orchestra is a supreme one. He has friends, former and current members of the Berlin and Vienna philharmonic orchestra,and the Mahler Chamber Orchestra. Along with well known instrumental soloists, also the Sabine Meyer ensemble and the Hagen Quartet.Abbado believes ensembles and so forth listen to each other.You can see that the orchestra love this man.I have never seen that in a orchestra. They are playing for him in their holidays. The 5th, 6th and 7th symphonies are excellent. At the beginning of the 1st disc,the Prokofiev Piano Concerto No 3 is played by Yuja Wang on the Piano. Disc No 2, has the Ruckert Leider, sung by Magdalena Kozena.Her voice is light compared to Baker, but I enjoyed the songs. It is a matter of taste,or opinion. The Bluray Discs come in a excellent white box, which is beautiful to the eye and has a booklet inside. 1080 full HD, DTS HD audio surround sound.Worldwide. The sound is fine. I have A Denon bluray machine with two speakers,but with Sennheiser earphones,it gives you surround sound. It is a new invention, a necessity for someone like me who lives in a flat.

0553801473|1.0|A Dance With Dragons?  More like a travelogue with turtles.  At this point, we cannot take anything Martin says at face value.  This is the author who said in the back of AFFC that the next book would be out in a year.  Six years later, and the book FINALLY comes out, and in lead up interviews he said he was going to answer many of the cliffhangers from A Feast For Crows.  Maybe he did, but I barely noticed because he decided to exponentially increase the number of cliffhangers in this book.  Brienne appears for like a page to show us that SURPRISE she's not dead, then scampers off to leave us wondering what the hell happened to her.  We never do find out her one word.<br /><br />Speaking of people coming back from the dead, expect a lot of that in this book.  The days when we could say that Martin's series was beyond the standard resurrection cliches of fantasy are over.  Once upon a time, it felt like no character was safe.  Now it's questionable as to whether any of them are vulnerable.  Numerous people are either getting resurrected or face fake deaths.<br /><br />Be prepared for lots of build up with little pay off - we get the prince that was promised but not the battle that was promised, winter about to come only to be left just shy of climax.  It's a tease.  Dany spends countless chapters fawning over a character I don't even think we were introduced to before this book instead of leading her army into Westeros.  The dragons that are supposed to be dancing are actually locked up and ignored for most of the book, until the very end when we get a moment that feels more appropriate to Eragon or Neverending Story.  There are PAGES of food description, clothing description, landscapes, and genealogy.  None of which is particularly interesting or relevant.  I also feel like Martin has upped the gross factor.  His books have already been grim but where this used to be edgy, it now feels forced.  This book could be summed up as rape bookended by some dinner menus.<br /><br />I could go on but it's all been said.  Truly disappointing, because Feast was supposed to be an aberration, but now we realize it might be the norm.  Even with the best characters back in the story he couldn't pull it off.  I couldn't wait to read this book, but he can take as much time as he wants with the rest of them because I don't think I can read anymore of this series until it's done.r /><br />I could go on but it's all been said.

B004EPZ070|4.0|After reading the book and missing the movie in theaters and then seeing the movie receive bad reviews, I was a bit nervous.  I liked the book fairly well although I found the way the ending handled Darcy's character to be cheap and unrealistic.  It was the one thing that really disappointed me with the story.    I thought the actors did a great job and I laughed many times throughout.  I actually found the portrayal of Rachel to be dead on with the book; her lack of assertion was more bearable in the movie than the book for me because it wasn't as long as reading her indecision and lack of confidence for many, many pages.    Overall I am pleased with the movie and am glad I bought it.

Even though it took a week to receive my order (standard delivery), it was worth the wait just for the savings I received. If you are \\"lost\\" at finding affordable DVD's,Consider purchasing them at Amazon.com. If you do,I think you'll be glad you did.

B000F8O4DQ|5.0|This album represented an optimistic feel to my mid high school years of competing with my peers and struggling for acceptance in such a judgmental society of jocks, burn-outs, Jesus freaks, and misfits. The latter, which I associated as of myself.<br /><br />High school is where you start to realize that if you didn't fit in, you could be quickly singled out as the guy to pick on, talked negatively about, or just get ignored by the people who heard unsupported slander about you. Well, that's where, when school was over for the day, and you just got your new (piece of junk) car, you went out cruising with your real friends. The other social rejects which you felt comfortable with, and belonged with after school.<br /><br />I guess what I'm saying here, is that high school was intimidating and made you feel that life was not treating you very well. The jocks were nourishing their egos by making non-jocks feel inferior to them, the burn-outs were always looking for someone to kick their a$$ just for fun, and the Jesus freaks were able to disassociate themselves from all the other non-Jesus freaks as if social acceptance was not a concern at all. So, us misfits were just targets to make feel uncomfortable at school.<br /><br />This album called \\"A New World Record\\" was the album that offered an optimistic feel about being alive. I was able to forget about the negative impact on what I had to go through at high school, and actually had found a new ambition to make the world my oyster. After high school, my life changed practically 180 degrees as I attended Dale Carnegie School and then joined the Air Force.<br /><br />During my first tour at Hickam AFB, in Hawaii, I started to appreciate my new life. As I always loved music, it was when I bought the vinyl album of ELO's \\"A New World Record\\" (because I wore out my initial cassette tape), I was re-inspired about my new optimistic feel about my new life. I recorded this album plus a few other ELO songs from their other albums, on to cassette tape, and I would play this tape through my Sony Walkman, while walking along Waikiki Beach on a casual golden dusk of a Tuesday evening or so. When I bought a car (a black 1970 Mercury Cougar), I would crank up the cassette while my friends and I would party at Hickam Harbor with the beers and the other guys and the girls. We all shared similar stories. None of us were high school jocks or burn-outs. We all found a positive calling in going into the military. And many of us shared the same love for this album of \\"A New World Record.\\" We all agreed that practically every track on this album were staples of simple, feel-good pop-rock but with a classical theme, and it served as a soundtrack to all our questioning that we tortured ourselves with, of the unknown future that generally seemed less threatening when this great album was played in our bedrooms at home.<br /><br />Whenever I hear \\"Tightrope\\" it takes me back to the great radio days of 1976 and 1977.  I don't care for \\"Telephone Line\\" as much as I use to to, but, \\"Do Ya\\", \\"Mission\\", \\"So Fine\\", \\"Livin' Thing\\" and Above The Clouds\\" are just great feel-good songs of the simple life before overwhelming technology brought stress and demanded urgency into our daily lives.  Thank God for CD's and recorded memories to return to.  Just shut your eyes, and listen to the music, and think about the good times when we were young.would play this tape through my Sony Walkman, while walking along Waikiki Beach on a casual golden dusk of a Tuesday evening or so.

0525950079|2.0|Once I started, I could not stop reading it - hoping it would improve.  It didn't.  It got more ridiculous.  The dialog seems totally out of place for the time period in which this book occured.  Things routinely happened which could not possibly have occured....like the prioress of a major nunnery at a Cathedral openly living with her lover.  Really?  Openly living with him?  Two nuns traveling from England to France, to track down a Bishop who is on a WAR CAMPAIGN to have the have the Bishop \\"right a wrong\\" done to the nunnery.  Again, the incidents in this part of the book were not even remotely within the realm of possibility.  The resolution of all the major characters' loves and problems was too tidily wrapped up....why hurry to end the book when it was already overly long at 900+ pages?  I read Pillars of the Earth years ago and recalled loving it - but either the author's skills diminished, my tastes improved or perhaps a combination of both.  Do yourself a favor and skip this book.  Follett used to be a great writer - Eye of the Needle & the Secret of Rebecca being two great mystery / spy stories.  I had read other books he wrote in between Pillars and this one - and I was disappointed in those too.  I had enjoyed Pillars though so I thought I'd give this book a try, but this is the last time I'll read Follett.  It was SOOOO  VERY  LONG that it delivered the 1st, 2nd and 3rd strike against Ken Follett.  He's out of my list of \\"must read\\" authors.
091581112X|5.0|I've read all but the last of Roman's books and hidden within the message is a very real directive to meditate and practice astral projection.  Without these two much of Roman's writings are useless and go in one ear and out of the other.  These books she wrote are a great guide to what to do when you learn to astral project so that you don't spend your time there simply tripping off of just being there as if it were LSD.  I can't astral project and I haven't yet begun to meditate so these books are something I will have to come back to in the future and I am working towards the goal of learning so that I can apply these teachings.  Don't think that you're simply going to read these books and be able to apply them with just head knowledge.  You must learn meditation and astral projection if you are going to be effective in applying what's written.  I recognize Orin's alluding to this because I've been looking into meditation as well as astral projection for some time now.  I don't know why they just don't come out and say it.  Also a well balanced yoga practice would work with this book.

0915811774|5.0|This book helped me to expand my love wider and higher than it's ever gone before.  It also helped me to further overcome my vindictive nature as a subpersonality that was against me loving others.  I learned to love the worst of the worst, yet not have to be chums with them.  I love more like God loves now and also I learned how to send this love to others so that they can heal.  This book is simply amazing as it is practical and I'm glad to have found it.
B000LPS3B2|5.0|This is one of those movies you wish would have come out just the way it was. The American version was o.k. but the original was so much better.

B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Such an intelligent comedy - just brilliant.  Any film that manages to brilliantly sneak in the Cantina music from Star Wars gets an A+ in my book.    A loving nod to so many of the classic alien films, and it still manages to be original, heartfelt, and action-driven.  Outstanding.
B000GH2YPG|5.0|Rebecca is such a wonderful and suspenseful book that every woman should read and see the DVD. I have purchased every DVD made from this book, that is how much I loved reading it, could'nt put it down and stayed up all night reading it. I could'nt wait to turn the pages, same with Jane Eyre, movies that are about true love and misfortune without vulgar words or nudity or steamy sex scenes, the scope is so good it does not need those in order to grip the reader heart and mind. I now own every DVD of the writer of Rebecca and Jane Eyre, House on the strand and Jamaca Inn, these two I am waiting for arrival, has been sent and I am anxious to get into these as well. When I was a child I read these, my very first adult book was House on the strand and after that I became an avid reader. I<br />was really too young to comprehend all of Daphne's books but I knew they were very good and reading them as an adult has been a true pleasure, I will no doubt read them again and again through the years and never tire of them. I now have a wide variety of favorite writers in various catagories and completely enjoy them but only Daphne makes me cry with heartfelt recognition to the characters and situations. I highly recommend Rebecca and Jane Eyre especially and if you buy the DVD get Jane Eyre with Timothy Dalton, it is the very best one, follows the book word for word and the actors play the parts extremely well, and Rebecca I highly recommend Masterpiece Theaters version with Charles Dance Emilla Fox Faye Dunaway and Diana Rigg, the very best of that story, they are extremely touching to the heart and mind, every woman should see these and read the books, I highly recommend them. Both of the books were purchased from Amazon and one of the DVD's. While you are at it purchase a Kindle 3G and download thousands of books from all varieties and most reasonable plus in 60 seconds you have the book in your hands to read from your Kindle, I love mine so well it stays by my side and often goes with me when I leave, it never forgets what page you are on, it goes right to it. What more could one ask for? And never a shipping charge with a Kindle, the savings are enormous and it pays for itself quickly. I also bought my Kindle from Amazon of course when this version came out, one of my daughters bought the largest one, sold it and got a 3G like mine, and you can adjust the size of the print as well.n goes with me when I leave, it never forgets what page you are on, it goes right to it.

B005BGBPBG|1.0|first time doing a review... feel like i really need to share so people don't waste their time/money.  honestly, i'm a huge fan of romantic comedies/dramas.  however, the acting in this movie was so poor and the story-line was lame.  i really couldn't relate to the characters and didn't find them at all believable.  i wouldn't even watch this movie if it was shown on a transatlantic flight and i had nothing better to do.  and that says a lot.
B00005JO9J|5.0|I was so busy with life when Grey's started and I never got into it. So sorry I waited soo long! I love the characters and the realness of the medical portion, being an RN I tend to criticize all medical shows because of their inconsistancy and lack if medical flow, I love that the show makes me feel like it could be another day at my hospital (except for all of the sex). Great job! I am hooked!
0545259088|5.0|At the same time beautiful and painful, Forever is an incredible climax to Maggie Stiefvater's werewolf trilogy. I went into the story ready for closure, but I found something even better: a novel so captivating that I didn't want it to end.    You can't argue that Maggie Stiefvater's writing is brilliant. The way she describes scenes and especially emotions makes the story so tangible that you could imagine the absurdity of the existence of werewolves actually in real life. The internal struggles of the characters only add to this depth. I usually don't care for characters full of angst, but there's just something about Sam Roth that makes you wish he were real so you could give him a hug - he is such a great character!    And for me, the characters are what really make this book (the series as a whole, really). I fell in love with Grace and Sam's relationship in Shiver, I was rooting for Isabel to find healing in Linger, and I totally converted to Team Cole in Forever - I loved reading all of the scenes in his POV; he's hilarious!    I really respect the fact that Maggie Stiefvater doesn't shy away from suffering in her books. Emotions are raw. There's no sugarcoating. People die, and those deaths aren't swept under the rug or used as a plot device. They're actually dealt with by the characters, who grieve and search for healing.    Like Linger, Forever is definitely a character-driven book. Honestly, there isn't a lot going on plot-wise. Cole is still desperately searching for a cure. Grace is a werewolf for half of the book, and Sam misses her desperately. Isabel is depressed, though she won't admit it to anyone, let alone herself. And all the while, the threat of Tom Culpeper and his desire to get rid of all the wolves is looming. What drives the plot forward is the fact that Tom Culpeper actually gets his wish: the government comes in to stage a massive hunt to exterminate all the wolves in Mercy Falls, meaning everyone - including Beck, Ulrik, Olivia, Cole, and even Grace are all in danger. So Sam and Cole [read: just Cole] must come up with a plan to save the wolves before they're all murdered.    But really, the magic of the story isn't in the danger or the suspense. It's in the relationships - the devotion between Sam and Grace, the tension between Cole and Isabel, and the budding friendship between Sam and Cole. Despite [or maybe because of] the fact that all the characters are severely wounded, they manage to to find solace in one another.    And how can I write a review without addressing the romance? It's really understated in this book, no lengthy make-out scenes or trite dialogue of love confessions. Instead, we get these short glimpses of the affection between Sam and Grace that maybe might have made me almost cry once or twice. And every time Cole and Isabel are together, you just feel the collision of personalities and sexual tension.    The end of the book is bittersweet for a number of reasons. I hated to see the series end, and in Maggie Stiefvater fashion: there is no tidy ending all wrapped up in a bow, no matter how much we would have liked to see one. There's still angst and hurt, all tinged with a wild loveliness that really embodies the entire series. But there's enough closure to satisfy all the fans thirsty for more Sam and Grace.

014241493X|4.0|I didn't like \\"Looking for Alaska\\" very much and \\"An Abundance of Katherines\\" was awesome. \\"Paper Towns\\" was originally meant to be something of a tiebreaker, intended to tell me whether or not John Green was an author truly worth following. Along the way, though, I started watching Green's video blogs and getting semi-involved in his online world, leading me to learn about the man and his writing almost first-hand.<br /><br />This absolutely influenced my appreciation of \\"Paper Towns\\".<br /><br />\\"Paper Towns\\" isn't very surprising, ultimately. Like John Green's previous books, it's got the nerdy, semi-uncool main character in love with the glamorous girl who's just beyond his reach. Or something to that extent. Quentin is a typical Green character, but because I also sort of expected that, I was okay with it. The guy felt straight-up John Green-esque - the witty moments, the nerdiness, the loyalty and the drama... all of it felt completely normal and understandable, coming from this specific author. Quentin and his friends had the occasional one-liners that made me burst out laughing for minutes at an end, personalities that were completely realistic and in-line with many people I know and like, making the reading experience all the more enjoyable.<br /><br />But it's hard to completely overlook the negatives, and there ARE a few. Margo, for instance, in taking on the stance of the larger-than-life girl, HAS to disappoint. Getting into would require spoilers, but her personality and her development - while entirely feasible to a certain degree - did not make her particularly sympathetic. It was hard to understand what Quentin saw in her and why he gave a crap. Her moment of truth came too late... and there wasn't quite enough of it. She's a character left unresolved. On purpose, perhaps, but it left me uneasy.<br /><br />The plot, too, requires some leaps and bounds of the imagination. Parents appear in this book (a surprising occurrence in young adult literature - kudos, John Green!) but they are, by-and-large, oblivious to the true occurrences and their input makes little difference to the plot. This means that absolutely crazy stuff happens with no comment from the parents, something I just couldn't accept (assuming, of course, that I accepted the crazy stuff). It's a bit contrived at times, but in good fun and done in a realistic and particularly clean manner.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I completely enjoyed reading \\"Paper Towns\\". The use of Walt Whitman's poetry was particularly well done, in a way that made me relate the poem a lot more and want to seek it out. John Green's writing is punchy and fun and flows well and conveys the story well. His characters, despite being somewhat familiar and tried, take on new and different approaches to oft-used situations, making them at once easy to relate to and believably real. \\"Paper Towns\\" is a book that's as much defined by its author as it is by its contents... perhaps this is why I enjoyed it so much.<br /><br />For readers unfamiliar with John Green, I'd still recommend starting out with his previous books. For those who have either read his first books or know him through his online persona, \\"Paper Towns\\" is as good a place as any to start.

I saw the movie first and Esther was in it, and so I googled who she was and her teachings have been the most beneficial to me of any. Truly life changing. You have to try the secret for yourself to see the results. There is no scientific proof, no physical evidence that it works.

B001R4MEUW|5.0|For some reason I started my Genesis collection with Foxtrot and Nursery Crimes with the addition of Phil Collins and Steve Hackett, thinking anything before this would not be up to scratch. I think this record is actually better than the 2 I just mentioned. Any one who likes the early Genesis should get this album, but make sure you get the remastered version as it sounds pretty good for such an early recording, once again I think sounds better than the 2 remastered albums that followed. There is not much of this type of music around these days for us old dinosaurs, so collect and treasure these CD's before they become obsolete and all we get to do is download stuff onto ipods and blank disks. How impersonal and boring not actually seeing something that the artists creates and releases as their special product for us the public to collect.
0374532125|1.0|Aid to Africa (and to other continents) certainly warrants a skeptical eye. As a development practitioner, I am always on the lookout for thoughtful critiques, based on facts. Alas, this treatise doesn't measure up. Interpreting aid as either  humanitarian assistance or budget support simply ignores a major, and potentially important, part -- training and technical assistance. And blaming the ills of an entire continent on aid may make for good headlines, but shows little insight into the historical, social and political reality. Finally, holding up the Chinese approach as a shining example is, on the face of it, not terribly persuasive. Why this oeuvre has catapulted Dambisa Moyo into the ranks of \\"development experts\\" remains a mystery.
B000FDEUFS|3.0|If you grew up with the Allman Brothers recordings from the Fillmore East you may be disappointed. It's good music, and it contains some tracks you may not have heard, but it suffers in comparison. If you like The Allman Brothers this is a must buy. Just be prepared for some not so subtle differences in the songs you know so well.    Yes, I know I'm being picky, but that was my impression of the product. The quality is good, the mix is as good as you're going to get live, and the song sequence makes sense. Overall it's enjoyable, and for me it's great road music, especially Mountain Jam.

From my own personal experience in helping them to achieve their current accomplishment, I completely relied on the wise selection of right books. This book is a useful source to familiar with the real GMAT test questions; but, should not be used as a only study guide. The math review section is weak and not enough for studying the test. If you need a complete math review book for the test, the other book \\"A-Plus notes for GRE/GMAT Math,\\" written by Rong Yang, gives a complete reviewer for the test, and clearly explain the answers.

B0034G4P8A|5.0|This movie had all of the fixings that make a perfect action/superhero film.  First, incredible special effects with lots of sets and very fast, high flying (literally) adventure.  Next up, cool looking heroes that don't make you cringe when they leap onto the screen and say a catchphrase.  And finally third, a great plot with outstanding action and enough emotion to keep the characters riveting.    I strongly prefer heroes with physical faults that have the risk of injury or death. Characters like The Incredible Hulk, which seemingly cannot be killed even by missile attacks, are just boring to watch.  Thor and everyone in Thor, is thrilling.  Great movie, well acted, fun adventure.
B004VRK436|4.0|In 1995 the movie \\"Jumanji\\" came out, based on a story by Chris Van Allsburg about two children playing a board game that came to life.  When it became fairly successful, another short story of Van Allsburg in the same theme was turned into a movie.  This was \\"Zathura\\".  Whereas the Jumanji game centered around an African jungle safari, the setting of Zathura was rocket ships in outer space.  Despite the nature of the board game, the movie \\"Zathura\\" is of the \\"fantasy\\" genre, not science fiction; the idea of children being magically transported into the universe of a board game is fantasy, and the universe depicted is a fantasized version of outer space that isn't intended to match reality (more on that later).  Zathura was generally well-received by critics but tanked at the box office.  However, despite the lack of success or of the star-power names its predecessor had, Zathura is actually the better movie.  It is less pretentious than Jumanji, and similar to Pixar movies is packaged with a nice little moral (in this case regarding sibling rivalry) that is not horribly overdone.  It also has surprisingly good special effects, much better than Jumanji's.  The \\"Zathura\\" board game that the children find has a graphic style that looks like the covers of 1950's science-fiction pulp magazines.  When the boys get launched into \\"outer space\\", instead of making the environment look like a REAL spaceflight the movie brings the campy 1950s-look of the board game to life and makes it quite realistic.  \\"Sibling rivalry\\" was a prophetic theme for this movie, considering its older brother was a successful movie whereas this one sank in the theaters without making a ripple.  Nonetheless, Zathura is the movie I'd watch again.

0316098329|5.0|I read Room on Kindle.  I couldn't stop reading until I had to recharge the Kindle (it had been about a month since the last charge) but then I continued to read while it charged.  It's an amazing piece of work, beautifully written and true to life.  My only criticism is that until The Great Escape from Room, I assumed the action was taking place somewhere in Britain because the style of speaking was very much English rather than American.  I don't blame the author for that; it could and should have been  fixed by the editors.
0553801473|1.0|After reading the first four books of this series I looked forward to reading the last chapter to find out what happened to the characters I came to know and love or dislike, (although some of the lesser ones were hard to keep track of), but much to my dismay NOTHING seemed to have been resolved. I don't mean to ruin anything for those still interested in reading this, (if you are DO NOT KEEP READING), but I for one was extremely disappointed in its ending. What became of Stannis, Lady Catelyn, the Wildings, and Stannis' queen, who was still on the wall? What happened to Melisandre, and so many other characters I can't name them all. Some should have died a number of times, yet they lived or came back from the dead, it was hard to tell. I felt almost angry that he left his readers up in the air to imagine their OWN endings. Can we assume Dany went with the Dothraki and was sent to the crones where dead warrior wives go? Can we assume Sansa just stayed with Littlefinger and lived happily ever after as his bastard daughter?  Did Cersei lose her trial with the battle of the champions? WTH happened to Jaime and Brienne?? Did they ever defeat the Others??  What happened to the dragons?? Come on George, you let us down. Do us a favor and at least write one more and tie up all your loose ends. Give us the satisfaction of knowing what happened to those we came to care about and those we came to despise.<br />I read somewhere that viewers of the HBO series were taken aback by Ned Starks beheading as they thought he was a central character and wasn't going to die. If that bothered them just wait to they see the new installments of this series. Wait till the end when they find out NOTHING.<br />I for one will not read anymore of his writings, despite being enthralled by the first four books.

0061730327|5.0|This book has been rightfully praised to heck and back and needs no additional laurels from me.  I'd like to note, however, the aspect of \\"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind\\" that sets it apart from other inspirational tales: how level-headedly unsentimental it is.  I don't mean that it's not moving  -  I mean that it's far more instructive and informative a personal account than the \\"spreading currents of electricity and hope\\" boilerplate the beyond-trite cover blurb promises.  The publicist should be fired for insisting on selling such a unique and meaty story as a vapidly platitudinous one.)  Most of the book is an account of the life circumstances in Malawi that spurred William Kamkwamba to create his windmill, through which Kamkwamba's simple, uneditorialized relay of the facts provides vivid insight into a number of social problems.  We see the high costs of making money a barrier to education as Kamkwamba's thrown out of school when his famine-impoverished family can't pay tuition.  Kamkwamba squirming in his seat every morning, hoping that _this_ won't be the day he's thrown out for nonpayment, is the kind of material that's heartbreaking without embellishment.  We see how Malawi's unstable electrical grid keeps farmers in poverty, as Kamkwamba's father is denied access to more efficient harvesting methods at a time when crop output means not only income but life and survival itself.  We _certainly_ get a close-up look at the damage corrupt governments can wreak upon their people when the president visits the village on what's supposed to be a photo op and the local chief dares to complain that his people need grain and silos instead of resource-hogging government-office renovations.  The devastation is also illustrated in the book's middle section on Malawi's famine, a catastrophe we learn stems more from corrupt supply distribution and funds misappropriation than from weather.  The material sounds grim, and it is, but Kamkwamba's family keeps finding ways to survive; the narrative's remarkable in how it avoids being oppressive (despite having every right to be so) yet doesn't sugarcoat matters.  Kamkwamba's persistence and family & community ties helped him to pull through, yes, and there's always the light of that windmill at the end of the tunnel, but it's plain that such was the direness of the situation that those advantages may well have not been enough, and indeed weren't for many of his neighbors.  \\"Harnessed the Wind\\"'s a social-science treasure trove  -  but that undersells how funny it is, with vignettes like Kamkwamba's account of \\"the night my father fought twelve men and won\\" or how Kamkwamba's friends, viewing U.S. films through the lens of traditional Malawi religious practices, conclude that Schwarzenegger & Stallone must've been protected by very strong magic indeed, to be shot at by so many enemies and come out completely unscathed.  The humor and anecdotes about the people who surround Kamkwamba give the book a slice-of-life side you rarely see in popular science or history tomes.  Later, as Kamkwamba rides high on the success of his windmill and endeavors to add ever more elaborate conveniences to his home, the book becomes a marvel less \\"Junkyard Wars\\" than \\"Quest for Fire\\"  -  we watch our narrator recreate the foundations of modern civilization with landfill trash and an old science book any U.S. library would toss for being forty years out of date.  Funny, but I learned more about basic electronics from \\"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind\\" than I have in an entire life spent ensconced in them.  Makes you think.    (Note: Kamkwamba has collaborated with a Bryan Mealer to pen \\"Harnessed the Wind\\"  -  understandable, as writing a book is difficult enough in one's native tongue, much less a second language.  At times, though, the prose seems oddly worded, and while that's not unexpected, given the importance of preserving Kamkwamba's own voice, I wish the book had provided more information on the nature of his and Mealer's collaboration.)
B004A8ZWVU|5.0|I have nothing to do with the US Academy awards but I will be very surprised if the actresses in this film do not figure prominently in the 2012 version.  This film is real, at times maybe too real for some, for example the not so subtle villain Hilly makes you want to reach right up on the screen and throttle her. The sad thing is that despite the best efforts of everyone, we see that nothing has changed by the end of the film, in fact, she has morphed into an out and out liar  by the end on top of being a first class bigot.<br /><br />The author clearly had some charisma to persuade the African American women to confide in her, this along with relating the story in their own way under their own terms makes for an honest, refreshing film with a happy end that is not all that happy.  There are ups and downs, just like life, but to me the biggest surprise was that the story participants never seemed to be surprised at events as they occurred.  They adjusted and they seemed to adjust well.  I would have liked to have known more about  what happened to some of the characters in the film.  It appeared that one of the main characters may have gotten seriously hurt, but the film never explained what happened to her.  I am sure this was intentional but it left me wanting more, I guess this is better than wishing it was over after 30 min.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend this film to anyone who was not around in the 50's and 60's, and maybe even to those that were.

0316077054|4.0|This review will contain spoilers for the first novel in this series, Beautiful Creatures.  So if you haven't read that novel, you're on the wrong page.      Beautiful Darkness is frustrating a lot of the time to read, since the narrator/protagonist is so often frustrated, and it 'infects', for lack of a better word, the reader.  Ethan Wate, said narrator, is an interesting character in that he badly wants to understand the situation(s) and do the right thing, but the people around him consistently marginalize him and treat him.......well not badly, this isn't Harry Potter after all, but rather dismissively.  Their attitude becomes \\"oh fine, if you must know I'll explain it to you\\", and I can't decide whether that's a good story device or not.  On the one hand, it creats sympathy for Ethan himself, and gives him a nobility that a lot of teenagers in these kinds of novels lack.  On the other, it can create a situation where the authors can make up rules as they go along.      The story is essentially a road story, becoming more a more a staple in YA fiction, along with the requisite 'lovers torn apart by events', which always has been a staple.  Ethan and his Caster girlfriend Lena are having difficulties that Ethan, as I previously said, really doesn't understand.  As in he doesn't get why there are problems at all.  He's not obtuse, Lena just won't explain them to him.  She disappears with the mysterious hybrid John Breed, whose motives don't seem especially good, and Ethan feels compelled to chase after her and protect her, even though he's not sure that he can.  And that's the story really, Ethan searching for Lena.    New characters include the aforementioned John Breed, as well as Liv, assistant to librarian Marian, in both her responsibilities.  From moment one Liv is set up as the Mortal counterpart to John Breed, and she and Ethan do have chemistry.  Back from Beautiful Creatures are:  Link, still dumb but totally steadfast, and he has an arc in the story aswell surprisingly;  Ridley, the Siren who's nothing but trouble;  Lena's various relatives, who range from complete evil to benignly crazy-ish;  Amma, Ethan's......I'm not really sure what she is, his family retainer or something.  She's less of a presence in this book, thankfully.    But the real reason to read the novel is Ethan/Lena.  Lena goes from mysterious in the first book to selfish in this one, and it's not a transition that favors her.  A bit more/better of an explanation for her taking off like she did would have been nice.  But Ethan is what kept me reading, he's a good everyman kind of character, and I could relate to him.    It'll be interesting to see how long the authors milk these characters.  The end of the story laid threads for future installments, this isn't a spoiler as Beautiful Chaos is due for release in October per Amazon.  In the next book I really, really want Ethan to rise up and demand that he be treated like an equal, shades of Harry Potter in the Phoenix book (though JKR stupidly walked it back in the following book).  That's what would keep me invested in the series.  One frustrating book can work, two in a row.......yeah, not so much.    All in all a good enough sequel, making me want to read the next one as soon as it comes out.  A very strong main character and reasonably interesting supporting characters make up for a flawed love interest and magical rules that are made up as they went along.    Four stars.

1577314808|1.0|Found this book to be quite interesting. Contains a lot of insight into finding a peace that is available to everyone, says the author. It's our thoughts that entail looking back into the past or hoping for a better future. Thoughts going everywhere else but the present moment, etc. that is a sure way to lose or be shut off from attaining this peace. Being in the moment is of vital importance and the author makes convincing arguments for this. A big obstacle, contends the author, is the ego.<br />You won't go far into this book before you find something that can't help but grab your attention.<br /><br />That said there is also a controversial theme found that other reviewers have made.<br />The author makes numerous references to God, Jesus, and Buddha and so on.<br />However, when quoting Bible Scriptures the author is found to take some serious liberties. For example, on page 99, the author writes: 'In the Bible, God declares, &#34;I am the Alpha and the Omega, and I am the living One.&#34;'.<br />The actual Biblical wording is:<br />&#34;I am the Alpha and the Omega, the First and the Last, the Beginning and the End.&#34; - Revelation 22:13.<br /><br />It could be said the author may have used a different Bible translation (if so, which one?) though when comparing the wording, a different meaning between the two becomes apparent. Further, the parables of the Prodigal Son (Luke 15) and the Ten Virgins (Matthew 25:1-13), among others, are worded in contexts to clearly support the author's premise without any acknowledgement of their true original meanings. Also curious, and to some, blatantly obvious, is that when quoting God or Jesus the author doesn't note Bible chapters and verses. This may seem a minor issue to some though to others it is a regular discrepancy of the book.<br /><br />Yes, it's an interesting read.<br />Yet at the same time I cannot wholeheartedly recommend it when the above noted and other liberties are taken.
0312370830|4.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" focuses on a tragic and somewhat hidden event in French WWII history - the roundup at the Velodrome d'Hiver (Vel' d'Hiv' for short) on July 16, 1942 - in which French soldiers rounded up thousands of Jews in Paris.  They were kept in squalid conditions before being sent to internment camps where they awaited deportation (and almost certain death) at Auschwitz.  Death was a guarantee for the four thousand plus children rounded up on that fateful day.  Tatiana DeRosnay has centered her mostly good novel around this event, crafting two stories that unfold breathlessly (at least for the first half of the novel).<br /><br />The title comes from the fateful events of that day in 1942 when ten-year-old Sarah Starzynski and her family are taken away by French police.  Sarah, not knowing the fate that lies ahead of them, locks her four-year-old brother, Michel, into a secret cabinet in their apartment, promising him that she will return for him.  Yet once she comes face to face with the realities of their desperate situation, she fears she may not be able to keep her promise.  This is the part of DeRosnay's novel that shines, as Sarah's gruesome and heartbreaking experiences at the Vel' d'Hiv' and in the internment camp bring the mistreatment of Jews to vivid life.  Her drive to keep her promise to her brother will certainly resonate with readers.<br /><br />Intermixed with this story is that of Julia Jarmond, an American journalist living in Paris, who is assigned to research the roundup for its sixtieth anniversary commemoration.  She has never heard of the event and is astounded by the dismissive attitude that she encounters from most Parisians when she mentions the event, including her husband.  When Julia discovers that the apartment that once belonged to her husband's grandmother is the same apartment that Sarah's family vacated on that day, she becomes obsessed with finding out more about this young girl and her brother, even if it means prying into a family secret that has been buried for years and also one that could destroy her already shaky marriage.<br /><br />\\"Sarah's Key\\" is mostly a riveting read.  Sarah's story is hard to forget and it drives the first part of the novel until Sarah's narrative momentarily ends.  The part that remains, narrated by an increasingly annoying Julia, is less riveting and likeable.  Julia is often a self-centered, waffling, insecure narrator whose quest seems much more focused on gaining attention for herself than on finding justice for the victims of the Vel' d'Hiv' roundup, especially Sarah.  Yet DeRosnay has definitely brought attention to what seems to be a covered up incident that demonstrates French complicity with the Nazis during WWII.  It is a sad chapter in French history that is too little known: with as much as I've read about the Holocaust, I have never come across this event.  If only the remainder of \\"Sarah's Key\\" did as much justice to the story as the first half, it would be a top notch novel.has been buried for years and also one that could destroy her already shaky marriage.    \\"Sarah's Key\\" is mostly a riveting read.

B00000IQCA|3.0|Although it is seemingly another delightfully aimless stream-of-consciousness all-star cast of Altman frothiness -- this time centered around the inanity of fashion week and all those who continue to make it happen -- this film was, in fact, created for one sole purpose, and that was to push for more stringent pooper-scooper laws in said city of poop/fashion lights. Apparently, still fashion and poop and poop-fashion reign supreme in Paris. Also, Altman is dead. So, really, nothing much good has happened since this film was released.

076790592X|1.0|If I could give zero stars, I would.  Having my husband die from ALS, I can only say this book adds insult to injury with its easy platitudes about enjoying life.  Dying is hard and dying from ALS is even harder.  It's difficult enough to endure without feeling the pressure to have the kind of saccharine epiphanies that the author callously offers.  Sorry if I didn't find ALS at all ennobling. This is exactly the kind of book that adds to the burden of catastrophic illness rather than relieving it.  The author should be ashamed of himself for profiting from another person's pain.
B00005T30L|5.0|Ghost World is one of those \\"I can't explain why I like it as much as I do\\" type of films. It consists of a storyline so simple it's basically mindless, and the subject shouldn't appeal to me either because it revolves around the lives of two teenage girls. Somehow though, I enjoy it thoroughly.     Anyway, after high school graduation, two girls are completely lost with what they'd like to do with their lives. Of course while watching the movie I was thinking to myself \\"Why be so depressed?  You just graduated high school!  You survived 12 years of boringness!  You should be out there celebrating hard and heavy!\\" but these girls weren't the party type apparently.     The entire movie is about these two best friends who spend all day walking around town and either tormenting an old classmate who works at a mini mart, or meeting much older guys at record stores (such as Steve Buscemi for example, someone who is very fond of vinyl albums and knows how to impress the ladies with his music knowledge- sarcasm there, haha).  Basically, it focuses around two girls and Steve Buscemi's character.    The two girls have very different personalities. One of them is much more sarcastic, direct and just has a darker attitude. The other girl is more shy, has a hoarse voice, and doesn't look for trouble or ever speak out of turn. The fact both of these personalities don't blend well makes for a *perfect* choice of main characters.     Eventually the two girls slowly drift apart when they realize their lives are changing and they find themselves caught between jobs, careers and boyfriends. Again though, it's funny to assume their lives would change in such a hurry in a matter of *weeks*. They should have been out there partying every single night. Come on, 12 years of school is finally over with! Get out there and do whatever it is teens do to party their butt off!     Overall, a highly enjoyable drama. I can't believe it's as good as advertised, but it's true. I guess I mainly likethe dark-haired girl since the plot eventually focuses around her anyway. Either way, satisfying and highly recommended.
B004XQO90E|1.0|It is sad to see that the original movie filmed at 1.85:1 was cut too 1.78:1 with no disclaimer that the film had been altered. The DVD and Blu-ray have been chopped.

B003YL4LYI|2.0|I couldn't wait to get this book & the HBO series helped amp my motivation. However, this was the least fulfilling book in the series. Absolutely no plot development, and Martin seems to be as lost in taping together character development as I was trying to follow. Too many extraneous characters, and clearly the exciting people I cared about reading - well, he just killed them off. I actually found myself skimming chapters. I think I'll wait until the next 500 page book, and then read the final 100 pages. Will there be anyone left that readers give a hoot about?
B001R4MEYI|5.0|I know this is a late review coming 2 years after the release of this album, but I felt compelled to write this after hearing a couple songs from their upcoming album (of course, of which I am excited about).  Mastodon is an extremely unique band in a tired genre and I feel that some of their work is the best of the recent crop from this genre.  Stating it that way would make me seem like a casual metal fan, which of course you will see from my other reviews that I am definitely not.  Anyway, in particular, I feel that \\"Crack the Skye\\" is a genre re-defining moment in metal.  Mastodon have carved out such a unique place in metal.  Their music is as artistic as it is heavy and profound.<br /><br />There are already many reviews on this album that go into each song in detail and how awesome they are, so I will not take a similar approach to my review.  Rather, I will give a general overview of the album.  This is probably one of the most musically dense, progressive albums you will find.  Each song is its own entity living and breathing within the structure of this work of art.  Honestly, this album is an immersive musical experience and a masterpiece.  There are so many moments in this album that I found myself saying, \\"Wow....\\".  I think any metal fan that gives it a chance will feel the same way.  There are so many influences in their style - so many musical textures and moods.  This album just takes that to the next level.<br /><br />How does this stack up to Mastodon's other work?  Well, there is still a very very special place in my heart for \\"Leviathan\\", but I can't help but feel that this is their greatest work.  \\"Leviathan\\" still stands the test of time as the album that defined Mastodon.  It is so hard to compare anything to \\"Leviathan\\" because of the nostalgia component.  I will say that I think this is a better and more mature album, but that both albums are equal for different reasons.<br /><br />All in all, I can't recommend this album enough to progressive metal fans.  Of course, for Mastodon fans, this is mandatory.  For harder metal fans that want something different, this is a great purchase and listen.  This won't slam you hard in a mosh-pit sort of way (although there are moments) however it will definitely put you in a \\"Zone\\".  For non-metal fans, this is probably a wasted effort, as in most cases; however, there may be an open-minded music fan or two that would give it a chance.  As for me, I am in love with this album and all the music from this awesome band.  I can't wait to be captivated by their upcoming release!  Mastodon truly Rocks!course, for Mastodon fans, this is mandatory.  For harder metal fans that want something different, this is a great purchase and listen.

It's not his fault that most of the actors who play the high school students at 'Ojai North High School' (including the 22 year old star, Emma Stone) are too old for their parts. Director Will Gluck and his casting director must take the blame entirely for that. Royal, on the other hand, has proffered up a script featuring a fairly unsympathetic protagonist, pitted against an assortment of noxious antagonists, most of whom are pure stereotypes.<br /><br />Mr. Royal has really found the formula for making a quick buck in the film industry. Simply come up with a story about shallow teenagers who attend a high school. Royal reportedly concocted this smug tale in five days and it shows. His protagonist, Olive Penderghast, is an insecure teen who initially doesn't want to let her best friend Rhiannon know that she's a virgin, so she concocts a tall tale of a weekend liaison with a guy at a local community college. Marianne, daughter of a Christian minister and campus gossip, overhears Olive's fictitious claim and then spreads the word that Olive is a slut and soon enough most of the kids at school turn against her.<br /><br />At first, Olive appears sympathetic, as she is willing to help Brandon, an insecure gay kid who hopes to gain acceptance from his peers by pretending that he's straight. Olive helps him accomplish this by agreeing to simulate a sexual encounter with him, behind closed doors at a party thrown by the 'most popular' teen at the school. But then Olive decides to embrace her notoriety by accepting gift cards from nerds who ask her to vouch that she's had some kind of sexual contact with them.<br /><br />Since the student body is basically depicted as a bunch of nasty, back-stabbing gossips, Olive is unable to withdraw from the collective condemnation and perhaps seek support from a more sensitive, intellectual type of student. Even the cool English teacher, Mr. Griffith (Thomas Haden Church) fails to help her. In a completely awkward scene, a student calls Olive an \\"abominable tramp\\", likening her to Hester Prynne from Hawthorne's 'Scarlet Letter\\". For some reason, however, Olive ends up in Principal Gibbon's (Malcolm McDowell) office after calling her an abominable (expletive deleted--starts with a \\"t\\", as those who saw the film will recall). I found it a bit unbelievable that a student would have to go to detention for merely calling another student a 't', especially after her rival started the whole thing; in addition, other students who have been actually physically assaulting one another, seem to receive an equal punishment . Actually it's never explained who actually sends Olive to the principal's office (why didn't sensitive Mr. Griffith try and defuse the situation?) and Malcolm McDowell, is also unbelievable as a surly martinet who cuts the kids no slack whatsoever.<br /><br />What's worse is that we're asked to root for Olive after she begins accepting the gift cards. By doing so, ultimately she bears the responsibility for compounding her negative reputation on campus and no one seems to point that out to her. Why does she act so surprised that one date almost takes things too far? Why also root for her when all the misguided males (sans good guy Todd) have no redeeming qualities? Also ask yourself whether you find it funny that these insecure males (en masse) would offer gifts to a woman who has such a dubious reputation. Is it really worth it to them, to have her vouch for them? In reality, having sexual contact with such an outcast as Olive, would probably lead to scorn from their peers--not approbation! So the whole idea that these nerds would shower gifts on Olive makes little sense!<br /><br />Olive is allowed to indulge in her negative, acting-out behavior since she's depicted as a total victim of a gossip-ridden society. Even if you believe that most people are like that, at least give your opponents their due: even the unprincipled have something of a likability factor! Not here! In addition to the insecure males, Christians also get short shrift here too. I have no objection to criticizing or making fun of those of the Christian faith but at least create some real life characters to shoot down. Here the Christians are narrow-minded bigots, buffoons, easily disposed of since they are completely one-dimensional. Even educators can't catch a break. Lisa Kudrow's Mrs. Griffith is perhaps the most unpleasant character in 'Easy A', having sex with one of the students and another one of those unlikeable individuals who have no guilt feelings about throwing Olive under the bus. Only Stanley Tucci and Patricia Clarkson, who play Olive's over the top 'New Age' parents, manage to eke out a few laughs by taking permissive parenting to one big extreme.<br /><br />'Easy A' ends awkwardly as it begins. Somehow, Olive's bombastic musical production in the high school gym and a one last 'heart-felt' web cast manages to convince the surly high school population that she's not so bad after all, turning everything around. And she finds 'true love' to boot with that one 'sensitive' guy who respects her decision not to give away her virginity right away.<br /><br />Despite the poor script, the acting and direction in 'Easy A' is spot on and the film has some nifty cinematography. If you can stand all the implausibilities and lack of 'ideas', you might find all this somewhat entertaining. For more discerning eyes, the most predictable thing here is that the critics were once again taken in by all the tripe. Hopefully, a few of us will pray for their misguided souls!opponents their due: even the unprincipled have something of a likability factor! Not here!

1451629184|5.0|I ordered this book as soon as it came out.  I wanted to read the story of Jaycee in her words. It certainly was a GOOD READ.  All in her words and memory of what happened and also bits and pieces of her diary.  I couldn't put it down and read it in 2 sittings.  I thought it was a good book.  I have heard others say it wasn't.  In my opinion, I liked it.  Maybe some people want more \\"details\\" of what he did to her.  And in that case, too bad for you. There was enough in this book for anyone to realize the terrible ordeal she went through.  It is the real story of her life. I would recommend it.
B004CHURRS|3.0|The most striking impression from this recording is - how much is lost in Natalie Dessay when she is only heard, not seen.  Until then, I have seen a few performances with this great actress and could not find enough superlatives to exult her art.  And what a disappointment this CD brought to me!<br /><br />I must say right away that without a doubt, Dessay is a virtuoso.  However, her voice alone, without an addition of her incomparable acting, is surprisingly colorless.  Also, it has always been somewhat childlike, this is why she is THE Olympia in Offenbach's \\"Les contes d'Hoffmann\\" - that is TRULY her role, she completely appropriated it;or as Zerbinetta in Strauss' \\"Ariadne auf Naxos\\".  She was ravishing in Stravinsky's \\"Le Rossignol\\" - and in all these roles she can be seen and admired.<br /><br />But as an invisible Cleopatra she is not very seductive; her manner here is of French chanson, but Cleopatra is hardly Edith Piaf or Maurice Chevalier.  Her monochromatic voice tires quite soon, and the somewhat easygoing conducting of Emmanuelle Haim does not help to create a crisp and regal, powerfully cunning and seductively overpowering dazzling enigmatic image of the great Venus Victrix as we see a victorious Cleopatra.<br /><br />Perhaps a mix of solo arias and duets would make a  better impression, because then her voice would be complimented by that of other singers.  Alas, her talent can be fully appreciated only in a video or a life performance - the same issue as with Phillipe Jaroussky, whose art benefits so greatly from visuals.  Not every singer can fill a single CD with a varied sound not to bore after fifteen minutes when sung alone.<br /><br />Also, on a different topic - the cover photo is somewhat unpleasant; her feet look giant like she is a female Cyclops.  Who would believe that the highest aristocratic Romans trained in the Art of Love by Ovid would fall for such huge feet???  I am not sure what that image was trying to convey, especially considering that Dessay seems to be rather small.<br /><br />It is a pity that as a vocalist she easily yields to Joan Sutherland, Arleen Auger,  even Danielle de Niese, whose voice is more richly colored.  This is a rather awkward  Cleopatra, especially with the somewhat sloppy musical direction, and the recording can be recommended only to bring a variety to the palette of available musics to be rather small.

B004LWZW4M|4.0|While the movie kept my attention and was entertaining, I'd have to say that I can't call it great. I was never bored, but I was never totally captivated either.<br /><br />In part this may be because of the computer generated graphic apes. Personally I didn't find them realistic so I was a little less sucked in to the story. To compare, the CG in Avatar was so amazing that I lost track of the fact it WAS animation and thought of it as real throughout the movie. I can't say the same for the apes in this movie. Perhaps it was the smaller budget.<br /><br />I would say that I even preferred the costumes and makeup in the Mark Wahlberg version. It had more realism.<br /><br />If I could, I'd give this movie about 3 1/2 stars. It takes you to what would have been the very beginning of the planet of the apes series of movies and shows you how the apes originally got their smarts, and how things got to where they could end up ruling the earth.<br /><br />The movie with Mark Wahlberg tried to do this, but this movie went deeper into the ape's perspective, and took place on modern day earth.<br /><br />For the most part, I found the premise and the script to be feasable. I liked the way it gave a reasonable explanation for how this could be possible. The story was decent and as I said, it kept my attention. But when the movie was over, all we could say was \\"it was okay\\" and \\"it was kinda entertaining\\". But it won't be memorable or a favorite.<br /><br />John Lithgow was absolutely wonderful as usual. He's a great actor and we enjoy him in drama and comedy. Brian Cox was okay, but perhaps lacked depth.<br /><br />Ultimately I would recommend this movie for scifi fans, and those who have enjoyed the franchise. I just think you should go in with realistic expectations.<br /><br />Lastly, there were some parents with young kids in the movie theater. I don't feel this is a movie for kids. There was too much violence and it had mature themes.

B000PMLFRA|1.0|I would gladly pay twice this amount for the original unaltered movies on blu-ray, warts and all.  This set contains only the altered 'special edition' versions, NOT the original versions.  Be warned Star Wars fans this is not the box set you are looking for...
B00511ONPG|4.0|\\"Likeable Social Media\\" is a very accessible book about social media engagement and how businesses can use social media to promote their business, brand, or product. I particularly liked the fact that Dave Kerpen avoided focusing too specifically on platform usage (Facebook, Twitter, etc.) and more on the rules of engagement, how to gain the attention of and interact with customers. The strategies that Dave explains are mostly platform neutral and would work just as well with Facebook, YouTube, or some not yet created social media site. Good for businesses who are looking to make an entrance into social media and need to know how to go about it, or businesses who are already there and need to focus on the strategies that will help you find followers, create fans, and convert customers.
B000024E9O|5.0|This is probably Genesis' greatest work, back when the band was in its heyday. If you are a fan of 60s/70s rock, especially theme albums that tell stories this is a MUST HAVE. Musically it is excellent, containing many wonderful songs and melodies. The songs and the story fit together seamlessly as you follow Rael through the trials and triumphs of his dream, learning about those things that concern a young man in those days.<br /><br />Remember, you can't claim to be a music expert if you haven't heard this album. It is in the same league as Dark Side of the Moon, Meddle, Tommy, Odgen's Nut Gone flake, etc.
1450400957|5.0|The Delavier series of Anatomy/Strength Training Guides should be in everyone's fitness library. Easy to understand, great artwork, just enough information while avoiding overload. It is great to know what you are doing to yourself and your muscle groups. So many people workout with a complete misunderstanding of what their muscles want and how they react to various exercises.Devalier fills in the information gaps for all of us when it comes to the proper exercises for the results we wish to achieve.

P.S. that hansel is so hot right now.

0312370849|2.0|This book was very well written for the first half. Great character development and plot. In the second half of the book the plot seemed to be pushed and the characters seemed to make decisions and choices that based on their development would not have made...at this point the plot became pushed and it seems that the ending was already decided before it was ready. It came off that the author had her own agenda while writing this book rather than letting the book develop itself.

0439023521|5.0|This book is an excellent read, as someone who is 39 I read the book since I told my 14 year old son he had to do summer reading. Well he chose the second book Catching Fire, because his class read The Hunger Games at school. Since I was a little curious of why he could not put the book down, I decided to order the Kindle version of the Hunger Games and the paper back of the other two. Lets just say I am hooked, could not put it down at night, or lunch. Now per my son and I discussion, we are waiting for the movie. I am not an avid reader of Twilight, or Harry Potter Series, but this triology is wonderful,  I love it. Kudos to the author.....!!!!
B000O8OTNC|1.0|...  I cannot get this thing to work for me. If anything, my knives end up even more dull after using this than they were before. Anyone have any suggestions or helpful hints about what I may be doing wrong?
0553381407|3.0|From what I've read so far the book has been somewhat helpful, although it does go into great detail of various topics such as drug and alchol abuse, sexual abuse and battery it seems to be somewhat helpful .
B001I9YOHW|5.0|Fright Night 1985 is one of a kind, period. Remake or not, which Ive seen...although not bad, still doesn't have the charm the original has. Chris Sarandon as jerry is the perfect person for the role, plus it has the whole 80's feel to it, which of coarse is the best decade for horror...
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|For all of Mia Wasikowska's delightful acting, I was honestly expecting a great plot for this Jane Eyre. In the 1996 version, William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsborough gave stellar performances in a movie that stuck so close to the book it amazed me. Even in the 1997 Jane Eyre starring Samantha Morton and Ciaran Hinds there was more liveliness and passion between the hero and heroine.<br /><br />This movie begins near the end of the story. And then it brings in enough flashbacks to leave the viewer confused. My daughter and I waited for action that never came: like the more dramatic scene in the 1996 version where Mr Rochester suddenly appears through the mist and his horse is 'bewitched' and throws him. There is no scene where Mr Rochester tells Blanche to her face that the lady is only after his money. Also, there was NO 'fire' scene whatsoever, only a droll tale of Mrs Fairfax's version of what happened...<br /><br />Regrettably, even the ending left me to see that 'yes, the characters have reunited' but as we true Jane Eyre fans know, in the XXXVIII Chapter: Jane says: 'Reader, I married him. A quiet wedding we had: he and I, the parson and clerk, were alone present...' Such a scene would have done wonders for this rather passionless movie...<br /><br />Scenes dragged on so that I wished for a powerful ending that was never to be! For, wouldnt the viewer have wanted to know that in two years, our hero Mr Rochester regained some sight so that: 'When his first-born was put into his arms, he could see that the boy had inherited his own eyes... On that occasion, he again, with a full heart, acknowledged that God had tempered judgment with mercy.'<br /><br />  Can YOU imagine this 2011 version having such an ending? Don't alot of us wish! In all honesty, as Jane would say, this is not the best Jane Eyre movie.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Very addictive. But fun you can&apos;t quit playing with. You must get all the pigs, and get to the next level.
B004UXUSIM|5.0|Midnight in Paris was enchanting. I knew nothing of Woody Allen's movies before I saw this but I thoroughly enjoyed it! When I brought my brother and mom back to see it, they couldn't stop bringing it back up afterwards. It got them and me to thinking ... imagining other things. It was definitely worth seeing and I will buy it as soon as I have the chance.
1451629184|4.0|Jaycee had loads of courage to tell her story and come out at the end after therapy to be able to start a new life.  This story should make some people in authority look closer at some sex deviates and wonder why they haven't committed more crimes against others!!!!
0698116496|3.0|I bought this book recently for my son and although he seems to enjoy it for the animal pictures, but I am undecided whether I like it or not. The illustrations are good and you pretty much have to make up the story as you go because there are no words. This is OK by me, reading is one of my son and I's favourite things to do and books with no text can be really fun. But with this book, the story just doesn't come naturally to me to tell it. Is this because I am struggling to tell it in such a way as he will understand? He is only 2 so perhaps a little too young to tell the story in full to. I don't know. My advice for anyone thinking about buying this book is to be prepared to be able to give some thought to how you tell it, if you're talking to really young ones. I need to work out some good words for it still. Then I think we'll enjoy it more.
1400031567|1.0|I've enjoyed the Wallander series, but this is beyond bad!  It's a short story padded to 420 pages and the 'story' is ridiculous.    When you're a famous author you have to keep pumping out books even if you have nothing to say anymore (the couple of million in advances and royalties or so, does come in handy every few years), although this book seems ghostwritten. Either way, it's terrible.
B000UJCALI|5.0|A great remaster of a timeless classic. The remastering allows for breathtakingly beautiful wide shots of the natural surroundings. The hotel literally screams with vibrant color. The sound quality has been tinkered with and adds a new dimension to the already edgy tension of this thriller. Great extras and behind the scenes. Awesome buy.
0553801473|2.0|Warning: This review contains an ample amount of spoilers, but I promise it won't drone on about the book nearly as long as Martin drones on about honey-covered locusts.<br /><br />I think I should go ahead and preface this entire assessment of the book by saying I'm a huge fan of the first three books in this series.  They're simply amazing, there's no doubt and I think it'll be hard for Martin to top the literary genius displayed in them.  Things started to go south a bit once A Feast For Crows came out: the compelling story was starting to disappear and the spotlight was beginning to center on a list of characters that was both too long and included characters (Yeah Brienne, I'm talking about you here) that either weren't interesting or weren't important... or both.  While this book was a disappointment to most fans of the first three books, it looks like a masterpiece compared to A Dance With Dragons.<br /><br />There's a rule in most forms of fiction and it definitely applies to a fantasy story: KISS - Keep it Simple, Stupid!  George R.R. Martin would have done well to learn this before he even sat down to write this mammoth of a book, ~1000 pages with about 100-200 pages of actual material.  This actually brings me to my next point, and this isn't really a rule that has a cute acronym or anything, it's just kind of something that any author should know: You need to advance the plot, and if you don't, do not write the book!  While failing to advance the plot as is the case with most of the characters in ADWD is bad, what's worse is that some of the characters actually regress and the story almost goes backwards.  Let's take a spoiler-heavy look at what was accomplished over the course of this book:<br /><br />THE BAD:<br /><br />Jon:  Has a few good chapters at the beginning where he gets to do some badass things and actually look like a capable leader.  Quickly becomes endless chapters of worrying about rations, hearing crows say \\"Corn, corn, corn\\", and \\"You know nothing, Jon Snow\\"s.  I was disappointed but surprised to find that the King Beyond the Wall was killed but don't worry: Martin no longer considers death to be as final as it used to be.  I lost count of how many times we had \\"gotcha\\" deaths on the part of multiple characters.  Jon's chapters end in an incredibly contrived HBO-friendly cliffhanger.<br /><br />Dany: I would suggest skipping her chapters and simply reading her last couple.  You won't miss anything at all and you'll thank me later.  Her chapters are filled with endless descriptions of a place we do not care about at all (If it isn't happening in Westeros, it shouldn't have over half a book devoted to it honestly) but her chapters are also filled with so many strange names for characters we don't care about that it honestly starts to get muddled.  I was incredibly confused throughout most of her chapters and found myself skipping whole paragraphs because I knew A. They wouldn't have anything important to say  and B. I'd be lost anyways.  Don't worry though, the prospects of the HBO show actually someday getting to the fifth book have somehow caused Martin to backpedal Dany's character back to a scared, naive little girl that fawns over bad-boy sellswords and doesn't budge an inch out of Meereen.  I wish I was kidding.  The dragons in the title of the book? They don't do jack, so have fun with that.  I audibly groaned every time one of her chapters was up next.<br /><br />Tyrion:  My favorite character previously, nothing happens at all.  If you like reading about incredibly large turtles I guess these chapters will be right up your alley.  While he doesn't accomplish anything his chapters were at least sometimes entertaining, giving them a slight advantage over Dany's.<br /><br />Connington/Quentyn/Victarion/Jaime/Mellisandre/:  Their viewpoints are largely a waste of time.  Connington and Aegon are notable however in that they are actually invading Westeros and they don't even have dragons to helpthem.  Not exactly what we were expecting from the title, but I guess it'll have to do for a game changer that came out of virtually nowhere at all.  Quentyn's storyline comes to an extra-crispy end with nothing having been accomplished at all, making us wonder why all the time was spent on it in the first place.  Victarion, while an interesting character, doesn't do anything of note in this book and his chapters were also largely a waste of time. Jaime didn't have anything to say, and Mellisandre's chapter was pretty pointless as well.<br /><br />THE GOOD:<br /><br />Theon (Reek):  Pretty well written chapters and his character DOES advance somewhat.  I could've done without the incredibly strange decision to have him aid in the rape of a teenage girl, though.<br /><br />Davos:  Gets maybe three chapters, but at least stuff does happen in them, so I also give them a pass.<br /><br />Arya/Bran:  They each get 2-3 chapters and while it's still ambiguous what exactly is happening to Bran, it's at least entertaining to read about what they're going through.<br /><br />Barristan:  Again, at least he did things.  He did more than Dany did in a small fraction of the chapters.<br /><br />Asha:  Gets two chapters, serves only to let us see what is going on with Stannis' army.  Oddly, Martin chose not to let us see any confrontation with Bolton's forces in this book.  You can either be naive and assume Ramsay Bolton is telling the truth about killing Stannis or trust in Martin's sudden \\"writing for television\\" mentality and assume the letter was a lie.  Personally I feel this is something that should have been shown in THIS 1000 page book.<br /><br />If I missed any characters, my mistake.  It means they weren't important at all either, so much so that I couldn't even remember them.<br /><br />You'll notice the viewpoints that are actually worth something generally are over in a few chapters.  This book could have been 1/4 the size it ended up being and nothing would have been lost from it.<br />Other problems with the book:<br /><br />I can only read the terms \\"mummers farce\\" and \\"words are wind\\" so many times before I start to see it as padding.<br />I don't need to know every single food item being served in a dining hall.<br />I don't care what color beard Mercenary #238 with no spoken lines has.<br />I only want to know about pertinent Westerosi history.  I can't count the number of times a useless character would drone on about the history of Westeros for paragraphs on end.<br />I could have done with an introduction that actually was tied to the book more meaningfully, or at all.<br /><br />I'd suggest checking this book out, and reading the chapters I said were good as well as the last few chapters of Jon and Dany.  Use a synopsis online to figure out the rest.  Hopefully Martin will be able to get some of the old spice and love for the series back, but the future looks rather bleak.

1451629184|5.0|This is a very easy read. Jaycee Dugard tells her story from when she was a child of eleven until eighteen years later. She was kidnapped and taken from everyone and everything she knew.      This book is in her words and very emotional at times. She was very brave through it all.  I would highly recommend this book.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|I actually really liked this movie.  I'm a long time fan of sword and sorcery books and movies and think this movie was one of the best in the genre.  It was a very exciting movie with almost constant action, what more can you want from a Conan the Barbarian movie.  It wasn't directly based on one of Robert E. Howard's stories but I think the Conan in this version was just as true to the Conan character as the Arnold Schwarzenegger version.<br />  I enjoyed every moment of this movie, this is exactly what a modern Fantasy movie should be. It was very exciting.  This movie was better than Red Sonia and The Beastmaster part 2 put together.  The fighting scenes were excellent and all of the battles scenes were top notch.<br />  I thought the setting of the movie was excellent, most of the movie was filmed in Bulgaria and made for beautiful and engrossing scenery which is very important in a Fantasy movie.  The castles and villages were also very well done and ominous looking.<br />  I don't see why critics are being hard on Conan the Barbarian (2011). In the excellent stories Conan hardly talks he just goes around killing people with his sword and saving slave girls, that is exactly what Jason Momoa did in this movie and he was very convincing about it.  If you want an emotional PC chick flick go see \\"The Help\\" (or rent it) if you are a real man (or a women who likes watching real men) watch Conan the Barbarian (2011)!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I usually never read any fiction books and I don't even know how this got on my Kindle but I am glad it did!  I did not want to put the book down, none of them.  I found myself trying to stay a[[ASIN:B002MQYOFW The Hunger Games]][[ASIN:B003O86FMW Catching Fire (The Second Book of the Hunger Games)]][[ASIN:B003XF1XOQ Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)]]wake longer just so I could keep reading. I was on the edge of my seat with each book, waiting to see what happened next. I give all 3 books 5 stars!!!

0062060554|2.0|I was hopeful that this book would live up to the \\"psychological thriller\\" description but was very disappointed. The premise has been used before so I expected a twist.  The ending was predictable and for a reader who has not read many novels before, it may have been interesting and suspenseful. For the more avid reader, it was simply trite and predictable.
0553386794|5.0|Having come to this book directly from the HBO series I was not disappointed. It read like the screenplay. In fact, the opening and closing chapters were exactly the opening and closing scenes from the series. So, if you liked the series, you cannot help but like the book.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|I have been using another Nikon Flash, SB-600 for a few years.  I needed something to travel with me so considered the SB-400.  So far with limited use, I love this little flash.  It is far better than the build in camera flash since I am also using a little larger lens (Nikkor 17-55 f/2.8) which sometime has shadow in the picture due to the build-in flash not 'tall' enough from the lens.  The SB-400 solved this problem and maintain good portability.    I'll be taking this to a trip soon and will let you know if I still like it afterward.
0553381695|4.0|Everything you could expect in the second of this four book fantasy. The plot thickens, the heros are in peril, the foes advance, and danger lurks from all sides. Martin weaves the web of his imagined world thicker and with a sure hand for romance, thrills, sex, adventure, and a bold cast of interesting characters. No letdown, just a buildup for more to come.
1932100660|5.0|This book has excellent information about the healthfulness of a plant based diet as opposed to America's typical animal based diet.  I think everyone should read this book.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I really enjoy listening to this CD.  There are some really good songs that I play over & over again while I am alone in my car.  I received my order so fast.  I just love shopping Amazon.com.  I have yet to be disappointed.

B0049P1ZZQ|2.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who is a huge fan of the show. The show is split in two discs, which is all cool, but the second disc is not bluray. How does this work out?? I would've given five stars (cause everything was great), but if I spend extra for bluray, I expect the whole product to be bluray.
0553582038|5.0|Look most readers had to wait 5 years to read this so I can imagine they were upset when they picked this up and saw no mention of Jon Snow, Tyrion, or Daenerys but if you look at what George is setting up for book 5 which is now available you will see this for what it is. A tour de force! Its setting the stakes for books 5 , 6, and 7. Great read, and dance with dragons is even better!
B0057A6GA6|4.0|Just wish they added something like combining weapons. To make it more unique, you know? Also, the weapons are never the same. Is it just me or that&apos;s annoying? Great game of course. A must buy!
B0051GOB26|5.0|Way out West, theres this fella named The Dude.<br /><br />This is a fantastic looking Bluray of an equally fantastic film. Its one of those movies you can simply have on. You don't need to follow the plot closely.<br /><br />This is a valued rug... er.... bluray.
B00122O0V0|5.0|Okay, I've got to admit I've never really been a big fan of Natalie Merchant. She was okay, but not one of my favorite singers. When I saw Amazon was offering this MP3 for $5 I thought I'd just sample it. WOW! The music, the lyrics, her voice was so hauntingly beautiful. The whole album makes me want to weep. I downloaded it after one sample and have listened to it over and over all week long. I'm a Natalie Merchant fan now. It's hard to pick favorites on this album so I won't even try. Just know that every song on here is soul stirring and beautiful. It makes a great soundtrack to your life.
0321687299|1.0|The authors' joking approach would be refreshing...if the material they covered was worth the read. Instead they dwell on points that don't need more than a mention, and STILL don't present it in a way where you learn anything. It's not informative at all, and starts to feel like an opinion piece on minor areas of presentation that no one cares about. I wanted to learn HTML5 and preferably some Canvas...this book did nothing to for that. I've found free primers online that do a better job and wish I had saved my money.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|This is such a great story and this movie is the most faithful to the book. But!...when I saw it in the theater the \\"deleted scenes\\" were apart of the movie. To remove the scene when Bertha rips her veil leaves the veiwer wondering why Rochester is in such a rush the next morning to marry Jane.  Regardless .....love the movie.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I'd been waiting to purchase this DVD for the longest time, but the price was always too high.  Found this great deal here....even with shipping, it was the best deal around.  I was told it would take weeks to arrive....yet I received it within days.  I watched it, and it was in perfect condition.  Would definitely recommend this seller.

0553801473|5.0|I'm not sure anyone will read my review since it's coming in after something like 850 entries, but just in case, I wanted to put my two cents in because all the almost hysterical anti-DWD rants may actually discourage people from buying the book, and I think that would be a mistake.<br /><br />Here's my take on way people are so enraged (***some general non-specific spoilers***)<br /><br />1.  They genuinely care about the book and want it to be the brilliant once-in-fifty-years fantasy it has promised to be.  They are afraid it won't, particularly since GRRM has taken 10 years to produce Books 4 & 5 (which could really be one book).  GRRM, like all of us, is mortal, so people are worried, God forbid, he will not have enough time to finish the books at all and/or he lacks the discipline and well power to do so.<br /><br />(By the way, anyone who tosses out bizarre insults about GRRM-he's lazy, he's arrogant, etc - I dismiss out of hand. If you have such little respect for him,  don't read his stuff.)<br /><br />2.  BOoks 4 & 5 are 'middle' books, much as the second book in the LOTR trilogy was.  GRRM deliberately decides to have his characters go in circles and for nothing to 'happen' - that is part of his point here.  Such books are much easier to read when there is a Book 6 & 7 to read immediately, or when you are confident Books 6 & 7 will be on their way shortly.  People are not confident of this.<br /><br />3.  The world of the pseudo Near East was poorly imagined, not as realistic as the Western Westeros.  In particular, Dany's world was not fully fleshed out--it is entirely corrupt & despotic, with no positive traits.  Yet the slave world of, say, Egypt, also had greatness--religion the arts, etc.  This Western stereotype of an Egypt=like state made Dany's stay there very hard to bear because in addition to the one-dimensional world, Dany herself was behaving really really one-dimensionally.<br /><br />Spoiler ** QUESTION---Did anyone else pick up the possibility that Dany was being bespelled by the wizards and that was the reason she locked her dragons and lost her way?  There are numerous hints in the book.<br /><br />4.  Finally, the books could have used editing.  Indeed, with good editing, Books 4 & 5 could have been one book of about 800 pages max.  Nearly all of the Brienne chapters of Book 4, for instance, could have been omitted. In this book, several Dany chapters could have been omitted with zero negative repercussions.<br /><br />Positives:<br />So what's good about this book?<br /><br />The tone, scope and breadth of this book was outstanding.  If you view this as a tale in which Westeros and the outside world are CHARACTERS themselves, the story becomes much more interesting.<br /><br />GRRM, I believe, is attempting to make this a story about a whole world rather than a mere story about Westeros.  Because he decided to do this, he had to follow several story strands he didn't anticipate he would follow.  This is also primarily a story about power---how to get it, how to lose it, what you do when you have it and what exactly it is.  In this case, the story centers mostly on the 'how to use it,' with Jon and Dany really struggling.<br /><br />As with all great writers, GRRM takes story arcs and goes FAR past the predictable--Tyrion kills his father.  But the story doesn't end at all.  Dany frees the slaves.  Then what?  Jon gets power.  Then what?  Arya trains.  But now what?  Bran finds the Children of the Forest. Now what?<br /><br />What I find particularly great about the book is how GRRM refuses to categorize good or evil (with the exception of a truly evil person like the Bolton thing).  Even with the Others it is not clear entirely what their purpose is, or what they are.  Is the 'kind man' Arya trains with evil or good?  Does it matter?  Which of the religions are 'true'?  All? None?  Are they really one?<br /><br />These questions are examined in even more detail and depth in this book than in others.<br /><br />It is a 'dance' and the dance goes nowhere.  That is part of the point.<br /><br />I may be wrong, but I think GRRM had the most difficulty writing these books, 4 & 5, because he didn't originally anticipate having to write them--they are mostly a bridge between 'here' and 'there,' both of which he seems to have mapped out.  It's the bridge part he's had trouble with, figuring out just how to get the characters from here to there, and what the point of the journey was.  I do think the next two books will come quicker and will have a lot more action now that all the chess pieces are in place.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend reading this, particularly if, like me, you know ahead of time that it's not extremely action packed (although it definitely has its moments).  Worth your time.
B002ZG99TA|1.0|Terrible script. VERY predictable. Same schtick from Washington... This makes the people managing and operating freight trains look like morons, and I don't think that's true. If they operated the national train system like they do in this movie... In fact, it was so corny and unbelievable, I couldn't watch the entire film.
B001JFZ118|5.0|There is something about Christopher Lambert that really made this movie work for me.  It has something to do with his glance.  When the situation calls for it, he can assume an extremely menacing visage--the eyes under his prominent brow ridge glowering and mysterious.  His look is otherworldly--as is appropriate.  But he can turn off this threatening appearance as well and be an amiable friend or loving husband.  I don't know about you, but I'm tired of movies where the villain upstages the hero.  This movie, due in large part to Lambert's peculiar charisma, does not make this mistake.<br /><br />I should also say that Lambert was the best Tarzan ever, for the same reasons that he was great in Highlander: [[ASIN:B0001NBLYK Greystoke - The Legend of Tarzan]].<br /><br />I should also note that, according to Wikipedia, Lambert's uniquely piercing glance is due to the fact that he is extremely nearsighted.
B004HO6I4W|4.0|We went to see this as a family, my parents and my daughter that is, everyone liked it, even my dad who notoriously hates cartoons and children's movies.  He liked the bull dog.  There's a lot of situational comedy focused on less intelligent people, tribalistic monkeys and just overall application of human stereotypes to animals.  It's worth a watch, not exactly epic, but pretty good and the kiddies love it.
B004Y1USV2|5.0|In a nutshell, this album is very enjoyable and I find myself playing certain songs over and over.  In fact, some songs are so good, I'm reminded of how I used to play 90125 repeatedly in 1983, obsessively.  Yes, I'm one of those fans who discovered them in 1983, but I love Close To The Edge and Fragile too.  I also love Big Generator.  Although I recognize the absence of Jon Anderson, Benoit David does a good job here...though I agree with the soulless delivery many people are mentioning.  We all know that Anderson evokes more emotion.  That said, there is simply a good album here worth buying.  I am a fan of Asia and Steve Howe, and feel Fly From Here shows off Howe's talents more than even the recent Asia reunion albums.  That's a good thing.  He makes this a Yes album for me, more than anything else.  My only real problem with the album is the repetitive singing in \\"Madmen at The Screens\\", but it's still an amazing song.  I don't know what to tell the old timer Yes fans.  I don't think I can say anything that will convince them there is something worth listening to here, but I will say if you appreciated Drama then you can appreciate this album too.  And you must listen to this on a good system.  The sound quality is great.
B0058ZZDVS|5.0|I didn't expect much from this.   In fact the pilot auto-deleted when I didn't get around to watching it (something I'm going to fix by downloading it from Amazon and watching now).   But I started watching from the second episode and got hooked.   It's well done.  Great characters!  Very entertaining.  Love Donna!  Love the kid (Mike).   Can't wait to see how the writers handle the whole Harvard diploma thing....   But for the new summer shows between Suits and Necessary Roughness I'm loving USA shows.  Really all one needs for must see TV.
0553801473|2.0|I realize that books in the middle of a series must necessarily seem rather incomplete and that they must set up the concluding books, but this wasn't worth the wait.<br />Martin is still 'hiding' too much stuff while apparently attempting to set up his conclusion.  At this point I am expecting the biggest deus ex machina since Philip Jose Farmer crapped up the ending of \\"The Fabulous Riverboat\\" series.  It appears that Martin has somehow boxed himself in from whatever storyline he originally envisioned.<br /><br />The only thing that could save this for me at this point is a massive alien invasion that rescues the monsters of the Frozen North Beyond the Wall who turn out to be the descendants of stranded aliens from a crashed spaceship thousands of years ago.  The Red God will then be revealed as an alien enemy of the stranded aliens who followed them and is trying to kill them all, take over the world, and raise humans as cattle.<br /><br />Seriously, while Martin is fine writer most of the time, this is too much.  Well-written if you don't give a hoot about plot, characters, or logic.  I'm done.  I'll not buy the next one.  I may skim it at the library to see if Martin has found some sort of half-resolution.  I'm betting not.
0545259088|3.0|I am a HUGE fan of the \\"Shiver\\" series and could not wait for \\"Forever\\" to be released! I had been counting the months in anticipation and wondering how the author would bring the story to an end for us. However, I would be lying if I said I was happy or satisified with the final book. I was bored through the middle part and just continued so I could get to the ending and find out how the characters would end up at the conclusion. But on the last page, I could not believe how \\"open\\" the story was left. There was absolutely no closure for any of the characters and I was left disappointed.  I truly hate writing this review and considered not writing it at all due to my love for this wonderful love story. But as a fan of the books and the people within the story that I have come to know through my reading, I felt I needed to be completely honest. I do want to add that I still LOVE the authors style of writing. It is different and very refreshing. I just think with this book, she forgot to include the last chapter when it was sent to the printer.    I wish so much that we had a final book that actually finalized the story. But we we are left with nothing but questions........    I gave the book at three star rating . I just couldnt go any lower for a love story that we all adored in the beginning.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Requires thinking and planning in the sense that you don&apos;t want to waste a move.  I like that you have to complete the set of 4 perfectly to get &apos;the gold&apos;  but perfection isn&apos;t a requirement. Definitely worth the 99 cents
B000002HRE|5.0|I bought the book Enter Night, a Biography about Metallica first  for my dyslexic grandson  and put it on our Amazon Kindle so that he could adjust the letter size. He loves their music enough to over come his resistance to reading. No small mountain to climb.<br /><br />Seeing how wonderful the book was, I popped for Metallica's Reload Album. We read the Biography and listened to the Album. Reading the book helped me appreciate the music more. This led to our purchase of the DVD, Metallica, The Big Four,Live in Sophia Bulgaria. This immersion of reading, listening and watching Metallica has made me almost as big a fan as is my grandson.<br /><br /> He is also a drummer. The book is all about how the band began and the troubles that they met and overcame.It seems to me to be an honest account of just how their career happened and developed. Some of it is quite moving and heartbreaking.<br />It is a marvelous book for any teen age drummer who wants to become a star and which one does not. Fortunately it is so well written and interesting that even I enjoyed reading it.<br />I recommend all three  highly for any kid and their parents interested in music.<br /><br />It also got him reading and that has improved a lot.<br />Being able to purchase every thing through Amazon simplified everything.<br />Ruth Aizuss Migdal
B00005JKL8|5.0|I am not really into movies like this. But, it was on TV this afternoon - in HD - so I watched it. I actually thought it was ok. I think Owen was a good choice for the movie. It was nice to see him in a different role that challenged him a little. I think he stepped up to the plate - personally. Would be nice to see him in more roles like this - yeah - he is good in comedy - but I think he is a decent actor and would like to see more of him.<br /><br />Movie in general - not bad. Wished I saw it on the big screen...but oh well...
1594744769|4.0|Set in a modern age, this tale spins into a fantasy of \\"Peculiar\\" children, each one unique with magical/supernatural abilities.  When Jake, who thinks himself a normal teenager, finds his Grandfather murdered, he takes a journey to the island where his grandfather grew up to find an answer the mysteries of his grandfather's stories.  Where they real or just fables to entertain a child?      I won't spoil it for those of you who haven't read it.  It's a very good story, and reminds me of sort of a Narnia meets Harry Potter. I would say it is probably written for teens, but that didn't stop us adults from reading Harry Potter or the Chronicles of Narnia!     The old photographs were a delightful touch to the story, but I would have liked a little more \\"meat\\"-more details. I'm thinking this book may have been left open for additional series.  If that's the case, I'll be back for more!
B004I8WD6E|5.0|What a great, sturdy, basic case! My favorite part of this case is how it fits on the phone. It is easy to get on, but does not slide off the edges easily - an issue I've had with other cases. The screen protector was good quality and did not \\"bubble\\" during application. The \\"applicator\\" was handy, too. The material is such that is has a little grip to it, but is still easy to get in and out of a pocket. As someone that has gone through several of cases, I would get this case again in a heartbeat!
B000WCB2LC|3.0|In the seedy grim streets of New York, there lives a psychopath who talks like a cartoon duck as he wonders the street at night and attacks people mainly women as he butchers them in vicious horrific ways. Detective Fred Williams is trying to solve these grisly mass murders and who is this mysterious duck talking killer as he is trying to find the clues that could lead to him.<br /><br />One of the most horrifying movies of all time and Lucio Fulci's most controversial and brutal film. Inspired by earlier galliaos (Italian thrillers) and Maniac (1980), this unpleasant slasher thriller is somewhat interesting at times but sometimes it's difficult to watch. It has been condemned as filthy misogynistic gory trash while some of Fulci's fans call it a classic but anyway it is a cult classic. There are horrible scenes of murder and torture even to an eyeball and nipple which rivals the same scene used in \\"Ichi The Killer\\", this movie predates today's torture shockers and possible influence on films like \\"Hostel\\", the \\"Saw\\" series, \\"Se7en\\", \\"The Untold Story\\", \\"Inside\\" or even \\"Martyrs\\". The music score is creepy at times and even funky at times like the opening theme and the acting is quite good, Fulci did get the blamed for being a sexist gore loving pig when his film was released but who can't blame the guy since he has been called an Argento wannabe. The film was banned or censored in some countries except in Japan which they dig Fulci's movies. This film is definitely not for the weak hearted, but worth a look for anyone who enjoys foreign horror or slasher flicks or detective thrillers.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray from Blue Underground gives off a very crisp nicely done transfer and the sound is very good too plus the extras include trailer, interviews and a look at New York Locations then and now.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"House on The Edge of the Park\\", \\"Inside\\", \\"Martyrs\\", \\"Perfect Blue\\", \\"Bloodsucking Freaks\\", \\"Hostel 1 & 2\\", \\"Cannibal Ferox\\", \\"City of the Living Dead\\", \\"Demons\\", \\"Salo: 120 Days in Sodom\\", \\"Cannibal Holocaust\\", \\"Maniac (1980)\\", \\"Caligula\\", \\"Pieces\\", \\"Driller Killer\\", \\"House of 1000 Corpses and The Devil's Rejects\\", \\"Ichi The Killer\\", \\"The Untold Story\\", \\"Se7en\\", \\"Saw Series\\", \\"Captivity\\", \\"The Human Centipede\\", \\"Tenebre\\", \\"Phenomena\\", \\"Suspiria\\", \\"Inferno\\", \\"Mother of Tears\\", \\"Ilsa She-Wolf of the SS\\", \\"Manhunter\\", \\"Silence of the Lambs\\", \\"Hannibal\\", \\"Untracable\\", \\"The Toxic Avenger\\", \\"8MM\\", \\"Wolf Creek\\", \\"Frontiers\\", \\"Torso\\", \\"Blood Diner\\", \\"Hollywood Chainsaw Hookers\\", \\"Blood Feast\\" plus H.G.

1451629184|5.0|This book is disturbing, and fascinating. I read it in one day. Well written, and very interesting. Not too graphic in the disturbing parts, but gives enough information that I wouldn't suggest this book for someone under 13 years of age.
B004EPYZT4|3.0|In the dark and ancient Hyborian Age, Conan the Cimmerian, brooding and grim and restless, roamed the lands in towering strides, fighting, wenching, thieving, and occasionally inadvertently saving the world from malevolent sorcerous threats. In the fullness of time, he is destined to bear the jeweled crown of Aquilonia upon a troubled brow. Except that this film reboot fails to deliver on that moody pulp sensibility of which writer Robert E. Howard was such a master. And, to cut to the chase, yes, the Arnold Schwarzenegger version is superior. That one had more of an epic scope. And, as I remember it, more of a sense of fun.<br /><br />I saw CONAN THE BARBARIAN at a midnight showing. What initially began as a hopeful and raucous audience, clapping and hooting, gradually became this subdued crowd, disappointment all palpable. No one clapped when the end credits rolled. Certainly, Morgan Freeman's civilized voice-over narration doesn't get your blood pumping quite like Mako was able to do in the 1982 film. And certainly this tired interpretation could've benefited hugely from Basil Poledouris's rousing score. GAME OF THRONES' Jason Momoa makes for a good Conan. He has the physical presence and he's got the baleful hooded stare down pat. You believe him when he's wielding his sword and carving fleshy bits off those what get in his way. You can't fault him for the dialogue (but you can fault the screenplay writers). Casting Jason Momoa means more closely honoring Robert E. Howard's description of his iconic barbarian. Momoa is lithe and catlike quick and glowering. And he's not a lumbering blond Austrian, which is as far from Howard's specs of Conan as you can get.<br /><br />Born on a battlefield, Conan, even at a young age, demonstrates exceptional fighting prowess. Leo Howard, in  his brief stint as young Conan, proves to be a disquietingly savage child, and there's a bit of stealing Momoa's thunder here, even before Momoa's arrived on screen. I think the best bits in the film happen when Leo Howard is getting his blood up and facing off against adult warriors (and winning!). But young Conan's game efforts aren't enough to thwart the pillaging of his village, the slaughter of his people, the torture and murder of his father. Still, the implacable warlord Khalar Zym (Stephen Lang) should not have suffered the boy to live. This is a big bad's typical bungle.<br /><br />We were never going to be treated to an award-winning script with this movie. But I wonder how less disjointed the plot would've been had it only stuck to one thread? To Conan's seeking revenge on Khalar Zym, maybe? The messiness of the narrative surfaces once Khalar Zym and his creepy witch daughter Marique (goth pin-up model Rose McGowan) are allowed to have their own sub-plot, namely their quest to reconstruct the bone mask of Asheron, an artifact of which broken shards had been scattered across Hyboria but which, when reassembled, can be used in a spell to resurrect the dead. Khalar Zym desperately wants his dead wife brought back to life. His freaky daughter thinks she can just as easily slide into her place. Eew[...]<br /><br />Another required element to the spell is the pure blood of a descendant of the necromancers of Asheron. And so cue Tamara (Rachel Nichols), straight out of the monastery (yet well-versed with a blade). Tamara starts out as this promisingly capable and self-reliant girl, and so it's bitterly disappointing that she eventually succumbs to damsel-in-distress-itis. Rachel Nichols sure can scream a bunch.<br /><br />For the lusty, testosterone-ridden teen, CONAN meets its sword and sorcery obligations. Claret flows, viscera erupts. Noses are abused inhumanely. There are some rather gruesome moments, some brutal kills. There are a fair number of topless wenches, and even one random and arbitrary sex scene. The set designs are somewhat reminiscent of Frank Frazetta's paintings (and Frazetta's covers are what got me reading Conan stories in thefirst place). So that's gravy.<br /><br />There is non-stop action which may or may not become tedious in your eyes.

0307716511|5.0|I read many mysteries and have my favorite authors.  I am so glad I picked this new author up.  I loved the writing style.  The technique of the narrator talking to her dead sister wound a tight plot. I could not wait to get to the end and neglected some responsibilities (like all avid readers do.)
B003Y5H59W|4.0|I rarely watch movies in theaters anymore, because I just don't enjoy most of the ones coming out nowadays.  Still, I heard from a reliable source that this movie was good, so I checked it out.  I figured it might tingle my Catholic sense the way Spider-man 2 did, or it might not, the way Iron Man did.  Still, I knew there was a chance that it might really be good.  I love the true-blue hero types like Captain America, and I love the older comic books on which this kind of adventure is based, so I checked it out.    First, let me start off by saying that the movie gets a lot right.  A period piece set in the times of the 1940s near the end of the second world war, a wimpy little guy called Steve Rodgers wants to be a soldier more than anything, but no matter what he tries, he just can't seem to pass the army's tough recruitment guidelines.  Enter a military scientist; originally from germany, who promises to give him a chance to be in the army, by means of an experimental formula, which amplifies all the natural powers of his body to the absolute peak of human potential and, perhaps, beyond.  Rodgers undergoes the procedure and becomes Captain America; fighting in the war to protect his friend Bucky, and the other brave soldiers on the front lines.  Much action and adventure ensue.  This ultimately leads him into conflict with the Red Skull; a supervillain in charge of Hydra; a nazi splinter-group that uses advanced technology derived from a strange, recently-discovered power source.    The list of differences between this movie and the comics it was based on would go on for days, and don't really matter anyway.  In the comics, Bucky wore a costume too, but his role was otherwise the same, and frankly, I agree with this change.  Bucky didn't undergo the procedure, so it doesn't really make a whole lot of sense for him to be CA's sidekick in a movie like this one.    The content of this movie pleased me greatly in some ways.  There was relatively little cursing, theviolence and death didn't get gorey (though in a story about war, there will never be a lack of death,) and the closest thing to sexual content was a woman yanking CA's necktie and kissing him.  The action is a little goofy at times, and overall, is has about the same vibe as a cartoon with more military types in it, which will appeal to some, and not to others.  I know some who were hoping this would be a legitimate war movie, but I don't see how it could have been.    The dialogue is rather standard fare, and the characters aren't terribly deep.  There's not much soul-searching, and the villain is rather two-dimensional.  In short, it wasn't Spider-man 2.  That said, I loved it, because this kind of storytelling really was popular a couple generations ago, when characters didn't have to be deep or excessively-complicated to be interesting.  Archetypes are strong and rarely deviated from in this movie, and I consider that a good thing, since when you get down to it, that's really what Captain America is about.  He's an archetype for the virtuous soldier.  Seeing him in that light, a whole slew of other things about the movie become clear.    On one level, the main character demonstrates tremendous courage, strength of will, dedication, humility and care for his fellow man, yet he knows what kinds of tough choices have to be made in a time of war.  He's moral to a tremendous degree, which is enough by itself to impress me, but the film has other things hidden in it as well.    In one scene, the doctor explains his reasons for choosing Rodgers as his subject; because he believed that strong men become used to their strength, and always want more, but weak men know the value of strength, and how to be good and true.  I don't care whether this was intended or not; this line sets up the rest of the movie as an allegory for Heaven; where only the most virtuous, couragious, humble people will go to be glorified, and receive new bodies, which can be used to help others.  That put a smile on my face when I thought of it in that light.    Still, the movie isn't without its downsides.  The hydra group takes center stage as the villains very early on, and seems to be just about the only group of nazis that cap fights.  Maybe I misread that, but I felt like this was an attempt to sort of pidgeonhole our hero into his own little world, so he doesn't bother the rest of the war going on.  I would have preferred to see real nazis with real villain motivations, or even a thorough characterization of Hitler, but that might have been too much to ask for, considering the direction that modern world events are taking.    There's one thing I'm sure of; this is a good movie, because it's a movie about good people doing good things.  It's no masterpiece, doesn't go too far into its characters, and the war action is, I feel, disrupted a bit by the odd technology being thrown around, but it's still a good film, and that's so uncommon nowadays, that I don't feel it would be right of me to give it less than four stars in any category.  It may not be very thought-provoking, but it's got its soul in the right place, and I couldn't be happier about it.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|this is one of my all time favorites! i dont have alot of movies on blu-ray but this one makes any collection seem complete!
B004DN3VEM|3.0|I got it today and, basically, you wind up listening to the same stuff 3 times. OK, the rough mix of Stargazer has a keyboard intro (not exactly going into the song smoothly, it might as well have been recorded later and just thrown in front of it). The tour rehearsal version of Stargazer is lukewarm at best, with Ronnie not going full out on the high bits, and the whole thing going ever more out of key towards the end.  Why three stars? Those are for the quality of the original album. I'd suggest getting the original.
B004YKB52O|5.0|I had been highly anticipating the release of this album by Simple Plan for well over a year.  I've been a fan of Simple Plan since I was 12-13 and they released their epic debut album \\"No Pads, No Helmets,...Just Balls\\" back in 2002.  I've listened to both albums that followed, Still Not Getting Any (2004), and their self titled album Simple Plan (2008).  Along with the creative title ;) and very catchy riffs and lyrics, I'd rate this album as a tie with their sophomore album.  It's definitely a blend of their original early work with a twist of modern tones built in.  I think they may have gone a little \\"too\\" pop on this one, but hey...it's still Simple Plan and it's still awesome.  8.5/10 in my book.  The reason I'm giving this 5/5 stars is because in comparison to the rest of the so called \\"music\\" out on the market right now, this definitely ranks in as one of the better albums of 2011.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|This is the album that will send Susan Tedeschi and Derek Trucks into the stratosphere of classic rock. The album is a pleasure to listen to from start to finish.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|Have had the cover for about a week now and so far it has been worth the money.  The cover fits in perfectly on Iphone 4 with adequate space left for the buttons on the sides as well enough space for speakers at the bottom.     This is by no means the strongest case in the market. But then again, I don't expect anyone to throw the phone from more than a couple of feet. As it says on the product details, the cover will protect the phone from bumps and scratches.    The only downside for me is the edges of the case are a little to sharp for me, it really does not affect me in using my phone but from a design perspective, maybe it can be smoothened out.    Final word: Definitely an excellent buy, worth the price paid for. good job amazon !
B003Y5H5FQ|5.0|\\"Fright Night\\" is great! This is how the story goes: Senior Charley Brewster finally has it all -- he's running with the popular crowd and dating the hottest girl in high school. In fact, he's so cool he's even dissing his best friend Ed. But trouble arrives when an intriguing stranger Jerry moves in next door. He seems like a great guy at first, but there's something not quite right -- and everyone, including Charley's mom, doesn't notice. After witnessing some very unusual activity, Charley comes to an unmistakable conclusion: Jerry is a vampire preying on his neighborhood. Unable to convince anyone that he's telling the truth, Charley has to find a way to get rid of the monster himself.    The cast led by Anton Yelchin (as Charley Brewster) & Colin Farrell (as Jerry) is great. The directing by Craig Gillespie is great. The story by Tom Holland (based on his original 1985 \\"Fright Night\\") & the screenplay by Marti Noxon is great.    The music by Ramin Djawadi is great. The cinematography by Javier Aguirresarobe is great. The film editing by Tatiana S. Riegel is great. The casting by Allison Jones is great. The production design by Richard Bridgland is great. The art direction by Randy Moore is great. The set decoration by K.C. Fox is great. The costume design by Susan Matheson is great. The make-up effects by Gregory Nicotero & Howard Berger is great.    This is another great horror remake that is just as great as its original. This is a fun, fast-paced and entertaining ride that keeps your heart racing and your heart thinking at the same time. This is a great vampire film. Colin Farrell is great as Jerry.
0446691437|4.0|The War of Art by Steven Pressfield snagged a prominent place in my TBR (to be read) list of library books.<br /><br />Why did I read the War of Art?<br /><br />Always on the prowl for writing books to improve my craft, one of my favorite published authors (don't ask me to remember whom) recommended this pocket-sized book of wisdom for aspiring writers.  I still consider myself an \\"aspiring,\\" even though I've bludgeoned through my first draft of Playing God, and I am already outlining my second book.  I know...I know.  Notice the arrogance surrounding my nil accomplishment.<br /><br />First things first, I looked the book up at my local public library catalog.  Heck, if I can get it free, why buy the book?  Bingo - in stock!  I added it to my holds queue (along with the max number of books on hold at any given moment).<br /><br />I read it first. When I'm plucking through that stack of books on my \\"reading couch,\\" I gravitate towards the shorter reads versus the epic-length literary works.  The pocket-sized brevity of this book signaled success...I could finish it before the library due date.<br /><br />What one take-away point did I receive from The War of Art?<br /><br />If I could only choose one, I'd pick the opening quote of section 1:<br /><br />There's a secret that real writers know that wannabe writers don't, and the secret is this: It's not the writing part that's hard.  What's hard is sitting down to write.<br /><br />This theme struck me as ironic.  We are writers.  Don't we always want to block out time to write?<br /><br />Career writers view their writing as their art, but most of all, it's their job.  Each writer experiences days where they would rather be anywhere else besides staring at that blank page with the blinking cursor.<br /><br />There is a stark contrast between the amateur and the professional.  The amateur writes only when inspired (not often).  The professional prioritizes writing time, whether or not the muse lights upon the shoulder.<br /><br />How can I apply this lesson to my writing?<br /><br />I have a choice to make.  Either I can dabble in the writing profession with a careless attitude, or I can become a professional writer through my dedication to the craft.  It's all my choice.  In five years, where do I want to be in my writing career?  Still fiddling with that first novel idea?  Or, working on my 10th book?<br /><br />Pressfield triggered some tender spots in my developing artist.  I cringed when he pinpointed my weaknesses.  I must address these issues.  Struggling against that negativity will empower me, only if I dedicate myself to the War of Art.<br /><br />Would I recommend this book to fledgling writers or artists?  Most definitely.  It's a short read, best absorbed through snippets of reading.  Though you may decide to read it all in one sitting, the War of Art is better used as a writer's devotional.  I crammed the reading into 3 evenings.  Looking back, I wish I would have savored each lesson, each page, each quote with relish - like a satisfying morsel of literary dark chocolate.make.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|*SPOILERS SPOILERS*    Its two o'clock in the morning and i just finished Mockingjay. I want to go over potivites first.    Again, there will be a lot of spoilers.  I have to say, that being a young male, this book has it all for me. You rarely find a book that has a strong heroin character throughout a series. As the hunger games as a series is somewhat of a lovestory, it's not the main priority of the book itself which i really liked. I was very happy that Katniss chose Peeta although, I can't say that she technically picked him. Gale just kind of dissapears without any goodbyes and as an important character, i wish he would've had stronger closure. This goes with all of the characters. They had no closure and everything was pretty much open. The ending with Peeta.was rushed and I liked somewhat that Gale knew, Katniss would always unconditionally love Peeta. I thought i wouldve been dissapointed that the children's names weren't mentoined, but as the author probably knew, there would be mixed reviews.     At times in this book, I was utterly confused and lost in the burst of new characters with no backstory and how they just died...whatever... Finnick's death was unneded in my opinion or it should've had a stronger impact on Katniss who actually became quite annoying and helpless. Also, Cinna's death just happened basically like... ok so Cinnas dead but he prepared everything for u...lets just not care -_-... Prims death was sad, but i kind of saw it coming. The reason that Katniss killed Coin made you think even though, she agreed to have another Hunger Games. The death of president Snow was extremely vague and was a huge letdown considering he's been a villian of intrest througt the series.    I never liked Katniss'  mother. She was always a weak character but proved her weakness by not returning to District 12 with Katniss. Peeta wasn't in the book. Sorry, but the Peeta we know and love was not in the book until near the end. First he was captured andthen he's disfunctional. Suzzanne Collins elaborated on the storyline of Gale which is ok except HIS CHARACTER HAD NO CLOSURE AT ALL!     Katniss was not the brave heroin in this book, but she was through alot so i completely understand that. Basically, the deaths were vague and some shouldn't have been because their storylines were so important. Anyway, great series. Couldnt put this or any of the books down,  i may have many dislikes about this book, but come on people, its the hunger games.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Having been(and still am) a Star Wars fan for over 30 years since seeing Episode IV in 1977 I can't wait to see the blu rays. Understandably these are the remasters and not the origanal versions for IV,V,VI  and while this is disapointing , why does it matter? Its a movie!!! To be totally honest the way movies are marketed the origanals will most likely come later on Blu Ray like all other studios do because of the damand, Lord of the Rings comes to mind most recently when they released the extended versions a year after they released the origanals because die hard fans wanted the ext versions not the theatrical versions. If this was the only factor why someone would not want to buy the Blu Ray now that is truely sad. The great Captain Kirk Willaim Shatner even said to Trekies to get a life .   Yes is it disaponting that the story line is somewhat altered after changing the cgi in the first 3 films, but this was George's vision, not ours.

B000002J29|5.0|Excellent classic rock in the finest sense of the word \\"classic\\" and live recordings at that!  Some groups heard live sound like garage bands on steroids (The Rolling Stones are an example).    ZZ Top can be a little harsh and unrefined...but that is the way ZZ Top was meant to be heard.    These recordings sound like studio cuts with audience tracks in the back ground. That is how truly polished Genesis is live.    I have seen them twice in concert and you had better believe they can actually do it!
B002GOAH1U|4.0|Adjectives for this movie:  Corny, unrealistic, campy, predictable, borderline ridiculous.  It's definitely not a thought-provoking movie.  Basically what happens is, we meet \\"Daphne\\" (Amanda Bynes) at the beginning of the movie; she's an American teenager who works as a catering waitress and has aspirations of attending college.  However, she feels as though something is missing from her life in the form of her long-lost father, Henry Dashwood.  So, Daphne travels to England to find him, but (whoopsies!) she forgets to bring her brain along (she does, however, remember to bring her memory photo album).  Don't worry, though, because her brain is right where she left it when she returns home again at the end of the movie.    I find the character of Daphne both likeable and annoying -- how she can go through most of the movie with that bubble-brained, vacant look on her face and have other characters chasing after her like she's the greatest thing is a mystery to me.  Colin Firth as Henry Dashwood is pretty much a PG-rated \\"Mark Darcy\\" (uptight on the surface with a \\"fun guy\\" deep down).  Eileen Atkins (\\"Cold Comfort Farm,\\" \\"Cranford,\\" \\"Wolf,\\" \\"Vanity Fair,\\" and so many more) plays Jocelyn Dashwood; one would have to wonder what she was thinking when she jumped on board with this one, lol.  Jonathan Pryce is another very talented actor in this movie (smh and wondering WTH?).  And Kelly Preston as Daphne's mother, \\"Libby\\"...well, I guess this kind of movie is actually right up her alley; it's the British actors that really surprised me.    SO MANY scenes in the movie bordered on absurd (climbing the wall of the Dashwood estate, the Royal Fashion Show, the chandelier incident...).  In fact, pretty much EVERY scene in the movie is absurd.  But do you know what?  I actually like this movie -- I don't love it by any stretch of the imagination, but I do like it.  You'll like it, too, if you just watch it and take it for what it is:  FRU FRU, through and through.  It's one of those movies you watch when your brain is on overload; you don't have to think or solve any mysteries or fear for any of the characters...you're not left asking questions when it's over or wondering just happened.  Yes, you'll drop a few I.Q. points, but you can get them back with a good BBC mini-series ;-)
B000IU3XU6|5.0|Both I and my family of ten love Josh Groban's music! This is definitely one of my favorite CDs.           My family purchased the non-Special Edition of this CD a few years ago, but when I recently discovered that there were two bonus tracks missing (Verita & Awake), and since over time the CD had become scratched and could no longer play the last 1/4 of the songs, I bought this one.       I work with my sister as a lifeguard, and I always play Josh Groban's music in the indoor pool, with this CD being my most frequent choice! It has been a hit with both lifeguards and patrons alike.      I would recommend this CD in a heartbeat. Thank you, Josh, for your beautiful music!
0465043577|5.0|everything you were ever taught about finance is a lie! (or maybe not.) \\"the (mis)behavior of markets\\" is an excellent introduction to mandelbrot's unorthodox ideas on the house of modern finance. this book was written for a general audience and was written late in mandelbrot's life, after he's had decades to polish his thoughts. if you want an introductory book to read about how the stock market is possibly related to fractals, then this is the book to pick up.<br /><br />fractals are the by now familiar mathematical objects that display self-similarity when scaled larger or smaller. their progenitors are those weird constructs, such as peano's space-filling curve and the cantor set, that were introduced in the late nineteenth century and subsequently sparked a revolution in logic. all of these animals of pure mathematical fancy were designed to challenge the conventional notions of the time and forced mathematicians to revisit the foundations of their craft. indeed, this line of thought led to the strange notion of non-integer fractional dimensions.<br /><br />so what does all of this have to do with finance? the dimension of a fractal is given by a power law. a lot of economic and financial data seem to fit power laws as well. fractals are characteristically self-similar. charts of stock prices exhibit self-similarity. yada yada yada and thus, markets are governed by fractals. wait a minute. that's actually not quite logical!<br /><br />ok, so there are some speculative aspects fueling this enterprise. this is the source of most of the negative criticism mandelbrot receives for this book. in my opinion, laying out some speculative avenues of thought is not a crime. scientists should dare to dream! mandelbrot himself acknowledges that this circle of ideas is merely in its infancy. he hopes others will pursue this path of inquiry and continue his life's work. and just why would anybody pick up that banner? well, because our current understanding of finance is deeply flawed while mandelbrot offers a (very rough) potential alternative.<br /><br />in the first part of the book, mandelbrot does an outstanding job presenting data contradicting conventional financial theories. the punchline: markets are much riskier than people think. in particular, he attacks the use of the so-called \\"normal\\" probability distributions in finance. this foundational attack threatens modern portfolio theory, the capital asset pricing model, the black-scholes formula for pricing options, etc. essentially, all the major developments in finance in the second half of the twentieth century are in jeopardy. some of the creators of these theories have won nobel prizes in economics, so a lot is at stake here. (an understatement!) note that mandelbrot's arguments in part one are valid even if the fractal speculations presented afterward turn out to be unfounded.<br /><br />mandelbrot uses plain language and analogies in his exposition throughout the book. he purposefully avoided equations, but he partially makes up for it through the use of pictures. mandelbrot was a very visual thinker and it shows in this book. for example, on p.179 mandelbrot offers a diagram of what \\"removing the trend\\" means in hurst's research. stare at the picture for a little while and the meaning should become clear to anyone with an interest in math and science. similarly, mandelbrot doesn't really explain how multifractal time works since the given father-mother-child analogy is fuzzy at best. however, the \\"fractal market cube\\" diagram on p.214 explains the concept of multifractal time in one picture. anyone familiar with projections should be able to understand this diagram without any problems. this compromise approach of offering analogies for a general audience while providing supplementary mathematical content in the pictures is suitable for an introductory book aimed at a wide audience, in my opinion.<br /><br />the best feature of this book for me was the autobiographical chronicling of a sharp mathematical mind at work. mandelbrot was able to see patterns and connections between seemingly unrelated fields and then he pursued these links relentlessly over decades of time. his individuality and perseverance allowed him to carry on even when the rest of the establishment were pursuing contrary ideas. mandelbrot also doesn't hide the moments when he was in the dark or when he saw connections that turned out to be trickier than his first instinct suggested. after all, this train of thought spanned a lifetime. and amazingly, some of his greatest insights came from pure serendipity. mandelbrot received a major breakthrough from reading a paper that was pulled out of a garbage can!<br /><br />in the interest of fairness, there are some relatively minor oversights in this book. this was the only real negative i could think of and it's easily forgivable. for example, mandelbrot incorrectly states that peter lynch's stellar performance as manager of fidelity's magellan fund was most significant when the fund was small. it's actually the opposite: market impact costs become a burden when a mutual fund grows too large, making it much easier to outperform the market when a fund's assets are small, especially with lynch's trading style. in spite of this minor criticism, i found this book to be a page turner written by an obviously extraordinary thinker.<br /><br />it's always a good idea to read the masters. if you want to understand the spirit of passive investing, read jack bogle. if you want to partake in value investing, read ben graham. and if you want to know why the house of modern finance might stand on shaky foundations, read mandelbrot. read, think, then judge for yourself. lastly, if you were hoping to make a fortune from fractals, read the following quote from p.6 of the book:<br /><br />\\"i see a pattern in these price movements -- not a pattern, to be sure, that will make anybody rich; i agree with the orthodox economists that stock prices are probably not predictable in any useful sense of the term.\\"ronicling of a sharp mathematical mind at work. mandelbrot was able to see patterns and connections between seemingly unrelated fields and then he pursued these links relentlessly over decades of time. his individuality and perseverance allowed him to carry on even when the rest of the establishment were pursuing contrary ideas. mandelbrot also doesn't hide the moments when he was in the dark or when he saw connections that turned out to be trickier than his first instinct suggested. after all, this train of thought spanned a lifetime. and amazingly, some of his greatest insights came from pure serendipity. mandelbrot received a major breakthrough from reading a paper that was pulled out of a garbage can!<br /><br />in the interest of fairness, there are some relatively minor oversights in this book. this was the only real negative i could think of and it's easily forgivable. for example, mandelbrot incorrectly states that peter lynch's stellar performance as manager of fidelity's magellan fund was most significant when the fund was small. it's actually the opposite: market impact costs become a burden when a mutual fund grows too large, making it much easier to outperform the market when a fund's assets are small, especially with lynch's trading style. in spite of this minor criticism, i found this book to be a page turner written by an obviously extraordinary thinker.<br /><br />it's always a good idea to read the masters. if you want to understand the spirit of passive investing, read jack bogle. if you want to partake in value investing, read ben graham. and if you want to know why the house of modern finance might stand on shaky foundations, read mandelbrot. read, think, then judge for yourself. lastly, if you were hoping to make a fortune from fractals, read the following quote from p.6 of the book:<br /><br />\\"i see a pattern in these price movements -- not a pattern, to be sure, that will make anybody rich;

0575085096|2.0|I managed to get through the whole book, although I was tempted to drop it half way through, from boredom.  It's occasionally lively and humorous, but there are too many dull passages, in my opinion.  After reading about 200 pages, I skipped to the end. It has a funny ending, so I have ordered one  of the author's later books - from the library.
0061537969|3.0|This is a book about perspective and metaphor.  Garth Stein delivered a lot of really good thoughts, and I fundamentally liked it.  It is a quick book to get through, and one doesn't have to work hard to enjoy it.    The main perspective is that it is a story from a dog's point of view.  I knew this going in and it didn't diminish the story at all.  The are other perspectives as well: the chief protagonist, Denny; Eve, his wife; Zoe, his daughter; vindictive inlaws; greedy lawyers; and friends.  I think because the storyteller is the dog, Enzo, then these other characters come away as more balanced in terms of their impact to the story.      Racing cars in the rain is a special talent that Denny has.  But the whole story is about dealing with a very difficult set of circumstances, which is \\"rain\\" in one's life.  How one negotiates that kind of rain determines where and how a person \\"finishes\\".  There are some lessons here.    I could have rated this book a little higher based on the creativity and writing perspective. It is close to a \\"4\\",  but for me, there was a little too much rain.  I guess that's why I don't live in Seattle.

B004A8ZWSS|3.0|I enjoyed The Tourist. It's not a life changing, Oscar worthy movie, but was something interesting to pass the time. I particularly enjoyed the ending. It was a nice surprise and I smiled and thought \\"that's cute.\\" I have no idea what it's genre is though. I don't see it as a comedy (doesn't have a lot of laughs), not a drama, not a thriller (nothing thrilling about it), not adventure, not action (there's no action except a bland running away scene), romance? Could be, but there's really no romance between the two characters. They kiss probably 3 times and there's really no passion or intimacy.<br />As most have said, yes the scenery is gorgeous, stunning. The hotel Jolie and Depp stay in is beautiful. Seeing it all makes you wish you could be like this Alexander Pierce that everyone is after, with his stolen billions, so you can live in breathtaking Italy.<br />On to the flaws--the actors. Jolie is my favourtie modern actress. She's original, unique, different and I consider her one of the most beautiful women on earth--when she had on weight. In her last few movies for the past few years, she's unattractively skinny. She's not the take-your-breath-away beauty anymore, and it's because she's so damn skinny. Besides from her alarming and unsettling appearance, she's very stiff in this, and doesn't show much emotion. She swishes around in heavy makeup, long hair needing a cut, and dresses I actually consider ugly. There's a scene where she's very Audrey Hepburn with her dark sunglasses and pearls, and was the one outfit I liked, but they didn't show enough of her in that scene.<br />Non-emotion goes for Depp as well. I felt he played his part even worse than Jolie. What the hell is up with Depp in this movie?! HIM, not his character, seems slow, lethargic, bored, out of his element. He plays it with no force or vigor. He has a little interest in playing his character but just not enough. The face expressions are there, but the energy and movement aren't (Bad guys arerunning after him, and he's scared, his face shows it a bit, but there's nothing within projecting). His face is also bloated, old, and unattractive. Seeing him \\"normal\\", you see that he's short and petite in stature. I don't consider JD ugly, but never swooned over him or saw him as sexy. This movie solidifies that he does nothing for me. But I've always aloofly admired him and his movies; the fact he chose to play oddball characters, instead of the the action hero or the hot guy. Some reviewers have answered my question about what's wrong with Depp, and I agree with them that it's because he's only comfortable playing eccentric characters. For him to be normal, is to be a walking corpse, basically. Jolie has more range and can be different characters while still being \\"very Angelina\\" in each.<br />The supporting actors give much better performances. Bettany gets an A for giving his best to be the lead detective. The only other I consider lifeless like Jolie and Depp, is the bad guy Alexander stole from. Who they refer to as the \\"gangster.\\" He's not intimidating at all and seems to be acting just to receive the paycheck.<br />All in all, watch this movie if you want to be transported to a beautiful mediterranean country called Italy, and would like to be entertained with a charming story about identity. Not for those that seek action, hate lighthearted, fluffy movies of the '50's and '60's, or require great acting from the actors.
0061997811|5.0|Yes, I am basing this review on a book I am only about one-tenth, maybe one-ninth, through. I just don't want to rush it! I am not even reading all of it yet, but rather, stopping and enjoying whatever catches my eye. I can go back later! I feel like this is what I have needed to get through the mourning period now that it's all over! I can not say enough about how wonderful this book is! I think the fact that I already love it THIS MUCH says it all!
B0006L0LOS|3.0|If you come home after a hard day's work and need to be greatly entertained, this should do the trick. Once you get past that this is in no way like the iconic \\"Catwoman\\" you know, you'll love it for what it is. You'll be laughing and shaking your head at how ridiculous it is. It's a very unique and different take on Catwoman. This story is more a Peter Parker scenario of a meek artist, who stumbles onto a secret at her job, she's chased by the bad lackeys and dies, but a cat kisses her and breathes life back into her, and she returns to get revenge on those that killed her, etc, etc. Corny as hell? Yes! Unbelievable? Yes! Entertaining? Yes! This is one of those so-bad-it's-good movies.<br />In the first few scenes of Halle as Catwoman I cringed: her acting came off very fake and trying too hard. But after a few more scenes of her purring one liners, I completely loved the way she acted. This is a very camp movie, with even a black singer belting out while Halle struts her stuff. Benjamin Bratt is adequate as the cop who falls for Berry (why is he always a cop? He also played one in that movie I like, Abandon) and is sweet eye candy, as usual. Sharon Stone is below adequate and doesn't play her role with much interest, which is understandable. I almost felt like she was snickering at the silliness of the movie. Should also mention that Halle is stunning with the long, curly hair; didn't like how she looked with the choppy hair.<br />I began, hating this movie, and was about to change it, but by the end I was rooting for Catwoman. It makes you laugh, so it makes you feel good. I look forward to the sequel!
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Despite the hate and vitriol some have for not having the original versions included, I think this is a wonderful story arc and one I am looking forward to sharing with my son when he gets a bit older (he is only 2 now). I grew up with the originals in the 80's, owned all the toys, and had no problem with the Special Editions except for the awful and forced Jabba scene in a New Hope. Otherwise the digital matte cleanup, enhanced sound and picture, etc are all wonderful and don't change the great story one bit. The biggest problem with die hard fans of the original trilogy in my opinion is that they look at the movies through the prism of their youth and make it something other than it was. I made it a point to see the prequels with younger cousins when they came out because I knew I was far too jaded as an adult to recapture the magic of the first movies on my own. I see how they recreate the scenes from the newer movies with their toys, have plastic lightsaber fights, and I remember that these movies are timeless and meant for all ages. These were fun sci-fi space operas, not deep thought provoking masterpieces. Jango or Boba Fett, they are all awesome to me!     Taken as a whole, the Star Wars saga is our modern mythology. Its a story of betrayal, loss, and redemption and its gonna look great on my 42\\" Sharp HDTV. Those complaining about the transfer being 4k I guarantee could not tell the difference unless they were using a screen above 50\\" and even then the quality should still be fantastic. Giving this product a one star review because of a lack of matte lines and bad color and sound mixing just baffles me. Its Star Wars, and I love all the movies in different ways and they all have faults. I'm just glad I get to lose myself under Lucas' stars in HD finally, and go back to that galaxy whenever I want.
B005BQNC44|5.0|OMG what a heartwrenching novel. Jaycee is a woman whos overcome the most horrific childhood, and yet throughout the book she still manages to keep a positive attitude. She is an amzing person and I cried a few times during the book. Jaycee youre truelly a special person and your daughters are so lucky to have you as their MUM.
B005BGBPBG|1.0|The whole premise of this movie is based on Rachael and Darcy being best friends.  I have one question:  Why would Rachael be friends with someone as unpleasant and selfish as Darcy is when Darcy has absolutely no redeeming qualities, not even one?  The only realistic character was played by John Krasinski which was the only reason I watched this movie to the end.
B003Y5H53S|4.0|Great fun for adult movie fans. Children are lost by some of the content and most of the humor. Depp makes it work.
B00003CXC7|5.0|I first saw this movie many years ago and watch it at least once a year. I thought I already owned it and quickly purchased it when I saw otherwise! Well worth the money adding to a collection.
1451629184|3.0|I listened to the audiobook, which is narrated by Jaycee.  I don't know what I expected, but the book left me wanting more of something.  I got bored during parts of it...especially the repetitious stories about the cats.  Some of the most interesting material came at the end, when she talked about the therapeutic horsemanship programs.  I would have like more information on the girls and how they coped with the life.  I assume Phillip left the girls alone, but it's never mentioned.
0446693804|4.0|The book was good. I wish I hadn't watched the movie a few years back because it spoiled the ending. Infact, I probably wouldnt have read the book after watching the movie, but I forgot that a movie came out for this novel. So once I got about halfway through I realized it. It still made me tear up and was a great love story regardless. Not my favorite, but it was your typical NS love story and I, a hopeless romantic, can never say anything bad about a love story :)
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I love this book! The cover photo put me at a distance for awhile. HOw good can a book be with a collage-d tongue on the front? Finally I decided on a sample. I was hooked ever since! I tryed to put the book to the side after buying it. I had a 3 hour road trip coming up soon and I wanted something to read while doing it. I couldn't help it. I just had to read it!   I stayed awake reading until six am. It was so worth it! The book was amazing! The way Travis fell in love with Abby, or Pigeon as he calls her, from the first moment he saw her was so amazing. Travis is a total alpha male, if you're not into that, don't even think about trying this book.   I'm looking forward into see more books from Jamie McGuire. I hope the author writes the Travis/Abby relationship from Travis's perspective. It would be amazing to see into Travis's head.    MUST READ!
B003Y5H53S|5.0|This is a great movie!! funny funny funny! fun for the whole family! Eveyone will fall in love with Rango! Johnny Depp at his best!
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|My wife and I have watched this show from the beginning.  We've purchased every season and have loved the show.  This season is probably the best one out of the series.  They ended the show in a nice way, but it is such a bittersweet feeling to be done with the show.  The acting is phenominal throughout the series, but this last season is the best.  I would recommend 24 to anyone.
0553801546|5.0|only bad part about this book is that I've finished reading it.  Love this series and look forward to reading more of her books.  I love her style.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just finished the last book in the Hunger Games and it was fantastic!  I originally downloaded it because my son complained that he didn't think he would ever get to read it, he was on the waiting list at the library for so long that when he dismissed for summer break he still had not made it to the top of the waiting list!  I said well if it's that hard to get your hands on, maybe we should just buy it.  We got the first book and read it in a couple of days and then we couldn't get the second book fast enough!  The author draws you in to a world that is your own but so different from what you know that you don't recognize it at all.  The characters are well developed, and easy to relate to.  The story is completely new but has an old world feel to it.  It's just great, I cant believe I hadn't heard of it before.  The author gets her point across in a way that you feel it could actually happen.  When the world as we know it crumbles, when humanity and kindness come at a high price, how do you keep yourself?  How do you maintain your soul and your mind in a world gone mad?  Unlike some popular authors who are to afraid to kill the characters in their story Collins reveals an ugly truth; sometimes people don't make it back.  Death is inevitable in some cases.  No matter how much you love someone, or want to protect them sometimes you lose them.  The stakes are high, you lose characters you love, but in the end it all comes down to age old ideals of faith, love, hope, and humanity.    So in closing I would like to wish you happy reading and \\"May the odds be ever in your favor!\\"
0385528752|5.0|Book review by Richard L. Weaver II, Ph.D.<br /><br />I loved the Heath's first book, Made to Stick, and I used the illustration I found in their book (about tapping out the beat of a song like \\"Jingle Bells\\" and then predicting the accuracy of getting another person to know what song was being conveyed by just the beat alone) in a speech I gave as well as in the revision of my textbook.  That book is well written, and it is, indeed, what prompted me to review their new book, Switch.  (The illustration is a great example of what it requires for speakers to know that they are accurately and precisely conveying their ideas to audience members.)<br /><br />You can sometimes gauge the substance, depth, or seriousness of a book by the resources on which the author(s) depend in their writing.  In this 264-page book, there are about 24 pages of notes, and the resources appear well-selected, academic, and thorough.  Impressive!<br /><br />\\"Chip Heath [from the back flyleaf of the book] is a professor at the Graduate School of Business at Stanford University,\\" and \\"Dan Heath is a senior fellow at Duke University's Center for the Advancement of Social Entrepreneurship (CASE).  Previously, he was a researcher and case writer at Harvard Business School.\\"<br /><br />The book depends for its basis on this fact: \\". . . the brain has two independent systems at work at all times.  First, there's what we called the emotional side.  It's the part of you that is instinctive, that feels pain and pleasure.  Second, there's the rational side, also known as the reflective or conscious system.  It's the part of you that deliberates and analyzes and looks into the future\\" (p. 6).<br /><br />The Heaths go on to borrow from Jonathan Haidt's book, The Happiness Hypothesis in which \\"Haidt says that our emotional side is an Elephant and our rational side is its Rider.  Perched atop the Elephant, the Rider holds the reins and seems to be the leader.  But the Rider's control is precarious because the Rider is so small relative to the Elephant.  Anytime the six-ton Elephant and the Rider disagree about which direction to go, the Rider is going to lose.  He's completely overmatched\\" (p. 7).<br /><br />With all that information offered, the Heaths now draw their conclusion regarding change: \\"If you want to change things, you've got to appeal to both.  The Rider provides the planning and direction, and the Elephant provides the energy.  So if you reach the Riders of your team but not the Elephants, team members will have understanding without motivation.  If you reach their Elephants but not their Riders, they'll have passion without direction.  In both cases, the flaws can be paralyzing.  A reluctant Elephant and a wheel-spinning Rider can both ensure that nothing changes.  But when Elephants and Riders move together, change can come easily\\" (p. 8).<br /><br />The three-part framework the Heaths suggest that can guide readers in any situation includes 1) directing the rider (give the rider crystal-clear direction), 2) motivating the elephant (get it on the path and cooperating by engaging its emotional side), and 3) shape the path (make change more likely, no matter what's happening with the Rider and Elephant).  (See pages 17-18.)<br /><br />This is a well-written book full of engaging stories that are drawn directly from the research.  Through the stories and the way the book is organized, the Heaths don't just draw you in and along, they continually show you what it (the stories and research and insights) mean to you.  It is their conversational style, their lack of academic pretension, their ability to distill and make immediate and useful the results of scores of studies, that make this an enjoyable book to read -- and for those seriously interested in change, or how to change business, how to make changes in your own behavior, or, even how to make changes in the world, their suggestions hold water.to the Elephant.

140131046X|5.0|Have a Little Faith: A True Story, by Mitch Albom<br /><br />Book review by Richard L. Weaver II, Ph.D.<br /><br />This is, just as the front flyleaf suggests, \\"a beautifully written story of a remarkable eight-year journey between two worlds--two men, two faiths, two communities--that will inspire readers everywhere.\\"  There is no doubt about it: Albom tells a great story.<br /><br />The book is a very short (249-pages in a 5\\" by 7\\" book) read, much like his Tuesdays With Morrie and in a similar style, mode, and approach.  The book is engaging, entertaining, touching, and fully satisfying.<br /><br />One reviewer at Amazon.com, Stephen T. Hopkins from Oak Park, Illinois, offers the best, short synopsis of the book: \\"Readers looking for a touching story about real people will enjoy Mitch Albom's latest book, Have a Little Faith. He presents the lives of two men from different backgrounds, different faiths, and different places. Albert Lewis was the rabbi from Album's hometown synagogue, and Henry Covington is an African American minister of a church in Detroit. What they share is hope and faith, and a love of God and people. These are inspiring lives that will lift the spirits of every reader.\\"<br /><br />Another reviewer of the book, Indian Prairie Public Library in Darien, Illinois, writes at Amazon.com: \\"Mitch Albom, who hasn't been to a church since he was young, is moved by the deep faith of two very different men, an elderly and spirited rabbi who wants Mitch to give his eulogy when he dies, and an ex-con turned minister to the poor and homeless. The book is touching and entertaining and just might get us thinking about our faith and the place God has in our life.\\"<br /><br />Anna Roberts Books, the author, reviewed the book at Amazon.com in this way:<br />\\"`Have a Little Faith' is a book I was so intrigued by that I couldn't put it down. It is such a heart breaking story, something you don't come across everyday.<br /><br />\\"This book made me laugh and cry. There were times I didn't even realize the number of pages I had read. I was stirred by the sudden slam of a door, truthfully this book made me realize things I could relate to, as the author, Mitch Albom, pointed out so many things in life we know, but don't actually sit down and read.<br /><br />\\"I can't believe the amazing journey Mitch Albom went through, it captured my heart and I am sure going to pick up another one of his books.

Maybe Clint will rehab the Nazi SS next.<br /><br />Otherwise the movie is an introspective navel-gazing pity party.

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I bought this film without reading any reviews because I liked the coming of age and coming out story line. But I did not know what to expect. I've bought a lot of Gay oriented films but most of the time have been extremely disappointed by the amateur feel of the film or the terrible writing or acting or both in many films. So I really didn't know what to expect.    After watching this movie it felt like one of the best films Gay or Straight I've ever seen in my life! It was not only professionally done, but the casting was fantastic. the writing was fantastic, the acting was superb and the direction and production extremely well done!! I've rarely ever given a review of a film I've bought but this film was so good I can't stop talking about it!    The screen play and script along with the great casting and acting made the characters come alive. Their interaction was not only believable but but you felt the definite connection between them. The story was so good, the acting was so good, as was the direction and production, that the audience cannot help but become emotionally involved. So many Gay oriented films end in tragedy. This film ends with an uplifting spirit of heartfelt hope that love can conquer all and win in the end.     This is a beautiful film, a beautiful story, wonderful acting and fantastic cast, and great direction and production. It is so good that immediately after watching it I went online to buy another copy of the film to give as a gift to a friend.    This is one of the best films I've ever seen!! It should have won many Indi awards and I wonder why it didn't? I highly recommend it to anyone, Gay, Bi, Straight... it doesn't matter, this film is that good! I can't say enough about it!
B003Y5H53S|5.0|I loved it. This was one of his(Johnny Depp) best movies yet! The language was a little bit harsh. The characters were all cute.

0765357151|2.0|This book is about a scientist who is in a heavy depression all by himself. He drinks all day and sleeps all night almost everyday for two years. He spends his days starring at naked zombie women. That is pretty much the book until the ending that is beyond stupidity, It makes the book useless. He contributed nothing in the story and somehow he is a legend. I for one have never seen a legend do nothing and then fail at everything else.

0385333846|5.0|I'm not sure how I missed reading Vonnegut churning through the educational system and several English courses and years later but here I am in mid-life reading the guy for the first time. Joseph Heller's Catch-22 happens to be one of my favorite novels of all times in the history of ever, which \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is often compared to. Their similarities lie in being unconventional non-linear plots, absurdism throughout, and both making a strong case to the futility and unavoidability of war. Great stuff.<br /><br />\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is short, very readable and poignant. Billy Pilgrim, the main character, threads throughout his life to major and minor events with the help of an alien abduction of sorts to allow him to begin to make some sense of it all.  The sense he gains after experiencing many things like surviving the fire bombing of Dresden from the ground as a prisoner of war, the death of a wife, the imprisonment with an actress/supermodel in an alien zoo of sorts is two things, after death and destruction birds still sing and the best we can hope for is offered in the serenity prayer. \\"God grant me the serenity to accept the things I cannot change, courage to change the things I can, and wisdom to always tell the difference.\\"<br /><br />Vonnegut has a way of drawing the reader in and proved through the living of his life that he was a humanist above all else, one who resisted the inaneness of certain parts of warfare while acknowledging it's unavoidability. I finally got to \\"Slaughterhouse Five,\\" through the dead and dying on the vine DFW Rogue Book Club. It's a great book club read but you'll just have to find some folks who actually read it and discuss it. I'm sure they are out there as it's a great book for clubbing. --mmw

0375701427|1.0|I don't need an ironclad plot, and I can take some dawdling introspection, but when the plot briefly pops up out of nowhere, like a meerkat, solely to let the author dive right back into dozens of pages revisiting for the fifth or sixth time some banal moment in the past that certainly had no role in causing the drama at hand then, well, we've got a problem.<br /><br />Every author, playwright, and screenwriter reaches a point, about four-fifths through the plot, where they don't know what to do to tie up the loose ends. At that point, the Devil sneaks in and whispers into their ear, \\"just make all the characters have adulterous sex with one another.\\" It's a cheap thrill that gets readers' blood boiling -- whether they like the book or not, if they're that far in, they're invested in the characters to some extent -- but does nothing more but tack onto what could have been an interesting and powerful novella yet another meandering foray into introspection and flashbacks.<br /><br />And what do you do when the old \\"everyone had sex\\" trick still doesn't tie up the loose knots? Stab someone in the face with a fork and then call it a day. It has been a while since I was so pissed off at the ending of a book.<br /><br />As one of the other 1-star reviewers wrote, this book reads like a rough draft: too long, too loose, too much introspection, structural difficulties, repetitious, etc, etc. I have no doubt that, with some major plot tweaks and a big pair of scissors, this book could have been great.<br /><br />Until they release that book, save your money and your time.
081297381X|4.0|This book is very hard to describe. I first got into this book because this book seems to be one of those things other authors quote. It is a mix of things in one mold. It is both a text book of sorts plus a political book. The text is very descriptive. It is full of the author's personality and vibrant opinions. To me his loud words makes the dry subject matter interesting. I saw a few others here take great offense at that.<br /><br />The easiest way to describe this would be to say it is an anti-statistical text book. Nassim Nicholas Taleb attacks the way statistics is used to shape decisions in today's world. As he walks through his examples you will realize just how much things are shaped by statistics. This shaping is as much a product of good marketing as it is by human nature to seek certainty in an uncertain world. Nowadays that uncertainty seems so always present in every newspaper we see.  Through this explanation of the author's arguments will make you definitely go ummmm!!<br /><br />For an example we in the world like to view things in the parabolic bulge. Most people reside in the flat middle. However the old 80/20 seems to shoot holes in that idea. That rule says basically life operates in the extremes, the ends of the parabolic curve. The most profitable anything, authors, football players, whatever exist in the top 5 percent. Organization practice is that 20 percent of your workers due 80 percent of your work. Just one example of how the book attacks old ideas.<br /><br />His description of this ideas are really thought provoking. It will cause you to reevaluate everything you thought about statistics. It really goes deeper than that. After reading the book you will see all of life different. Where as I don't think you can totally throw out statistics the author has some very valid points. It will change how you view the world.
0321544080|4.0|The reviews I have read until now are all correct.Here is the short(er)  version:  You have to have some knowledge of professional photography - what is a softbox, what is a gel filter (I did´t even know!) But he explains, most of all, you MUST use your imagination and think OUT OF THE BOX to get these unusual pictures . He will do whatever it takes to get THAT SHOT! and as you will see, his pictures are EXTRAORDINARY!  another reviewer said you need to get expensive equipment - that was not my impression. It´s your imagination that takes the picture- use what you have or buy a little at a time.  He does things that I WOULD NEVER THINK OF, like covering the bottom of the softbox so that the toes are not lit up.   If you are REALLY interested in becoming a pro, then this book is for you. If you just want to look at gorgeous pictures, get it for your coffee table. But If you are just a photographer with a little point and shoot camera and you want to learn how to take professional pics, you will be totally overwhelmed.
B004QL7K2K|5.0|Based on the novel by David Nicholls, the film adaptation of One Day offers a glimpse of the non-romantic relationship of university acquaintances or the male-female version of bff's between Dexter Mayhew (Jim Sturgess) and Emma Morely (Anne Hathaway) that spanned from 1986-2006.  However, the first few scenes already show an existence of an undercurrent of romance despite the promise that the two made to strictly to remain platonic friends.  And with most novels that have been adapted to film, it is no surprise that some important elements have been left out and others remain in order to provide an effective film and storyline that attempts to closely resemble what is included in the book.  But nevertheless, the film keeps the main premise of novel and the fascinating relationship that develops between Dexter and Emma in place.<br /><br />One Day is an extremely enlightening film that bears comparison to other romantic-dramatic films that have a tint of humor on the side, When Harry Met Sally, and the numerous Woody Allen films, Bridget Jones Diary, and on the dramatic side, the film resonates into a Nicholas Sparks novel.  But what is interesting about this film as opposed to the list above, the characters of Dexter and Emma are unique like the tattoo mark on Dexter's ankle that represents the yin and yang, opposites that tend to compliment the universe; indeed, the film shows that energy in the form of creativity and array of emotions that may have viewers laughing one moment and crying the next because there exists a bit of empathy for the characters, especially for Dexter as he appears most confident during the beginning of the film but later dwindles within the last hour.  But by the end of the film, he is able to overcome the tragedies that had come his way.<br /><br />Although One Day may not be an unpredictable film because of the foreseen events that take place within each particular scene, viewers will see how Dexter and Emma have progressed within their lives.
B004EPYZOO|3.0|\\"Drive Angry\\" stars Nicholas Cage as one \\"Milton\\" hell-bent on revenge, trying to retrieve his granddaughter from a cult religious leader Jonah King (Billy Burke), who abducted her after murdering Milton's daughter. But don't take the film's subject matter too seriously as a grindhouse-type action movie is full of tongue-in-cheek moments, like our hero's ridiculously over-the-top dialogues and borderline silly shootouts. In a motel room Milton is seen gunning down the henchmen - while having a sex with a lady.    It's a bad taste, and \\"Drive Angry\\" is supposed to be that way. The story doesn't make much sense - we don't exactly know how Milton (John?) escaped from the hell, or why an \\"FBI\\" agent (actually \\"The Accountant\\") played by scenery-chewing, scene-stealing William Fichtner has to chase him. It's all about guns, gores and cars, especially muscle cars. Director Patrick Lussier's use of 3D techniques is also old-fashioned. You don't get the subtlety of the visual world of \\"Avatar.\\" In \\"Drive Angry\\" objects will be flying at you even when they don't need to.      Patrick Lussier (following his \\"My Bloody Valentine 3D\\") knows what he is doing, but compared with other recent examples of films inspired by the campy 1970s exploitation movies (like \\"Machete\\"), the level of violence seems tame, for better or worse. Also, the film stars Amber Heard and David Morse, but Morse's role is disappointingly small. Perhaps directors like Rodriguez or Tarantino would have given him more to do.    \\"Drive Angry\\" is a throwback to the trashy 70s style B-action film, updated with the modern (but not best kind of) special effects and the star Nicholas Cage. It's pretty silly, but not bad.

But the final episode, could have been so much stronger!
0393338827|5.0|Interesting account of a handful of independent thinkers who saw the subprime crisis coming and had the courage of their convictions to place big bets on the outcome.     The Big Short by Michael Lewis reads like a novel as he chronicles events leading up to the global financial crisis.     While most people believed AAA rated securities could be based on subprime loans to people who couldn't afford to repay them because US house prices would go on rising, a small number of people went against the crowd and, after some anxious moments, made fortunes as the crisis unfolded.     Lewis tells their stories. They tended to be outsiders, independent in spirit and thought, and obsessive. They saw the opportunity, delved deeply into details of legal and financial documents, analyzed data on house prices, loan terms, and demographics.     Their research lead them to see the bubble in housing prices financed by loans that could not be repaid. They discovered mortgage managers lending money to people with no jobs, other assets, or incomes. What followed was a game of pass the parcel where mortgages of dubious quality were bundled into diversified portfolios of mortgages as backing for bonds that were then \\"assessed\\" by ratings agencies as being highly unlikely to default and then sold to investors. Remarkably, even the banks and investment banks that packaged the flawed securities often invested in them themselves.     To profit from their insights, Lewis's heroes found ways to bet housing prices would fall and borrowers would default. Lewis makes the transactions that collectively comprised the \\"Big Short\\" understandable.     After they had made up their minds and taken their positions, Lewis's heroes continued to seek evidence to show that they were wrong - they attended subprime mortgage industry conferences, spoke to top investors, dealers and rating agencies. I think seeking evidence to challenge your own beliefs is vital for good decision making that was sadly lacking inthe rating agencies, regulatory authorities, and amongst investors.     How could so many well paid people plunge the global financial system into crisis? In Lewis's view, incentives for taking risks without bearing personal responsibility for the consequences was a major factor. Lewis is highly critical of Wall Street's culture. As Lewis has said, when he wrote \\"Liar's Poker\\" revealing his own experiences working for Salomon Brothers in the 1980s he thought that in years to come it would be looked back on as a quaint period piece. He now believes that Wall Street's flawed character is remarkably enduring and resistant to change.

B004LWZW4W|5.0|Remember the old thought-provoking science fiction films of the pre-nineties? While there have been a few since then, in general, Hollywood appears to have been languishing in the originality and thought department. Modern films also tend to treat their audiences like morons, or just be very simplistic in nature. Rest assured, \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" has all the greatness of a future classic - the viewer won't walk out of THIS one disappointed.    \\"Rise\\" tells the story of Caesar, who, for those who have seen the other \\"Apes\\" films and thus remember this, began the original ape rebellion against humanity. A new drug has been developed by the aptly-named Gen-Sys to cure Alzheimer's disease. Used on the chimpanzees taken specifically for animal testing, it makes them super-intelligent. Caesar, as a baby, is taken in after his mother is killed, kept under the care of Will, whose father has Alzheimer's. The results of this have a domino effect for spoilers:  saying much else about the plot will take away much of the enjoyment factor of the film as surprises wait around each corner.    Homages and nods to the original films abound throughout, from the name \\"Bright Eyes\\" to Charlton Heston making a brief appearance on a TV screen to one of the series' most iconic lines. The film is packed with minute after minute, from beginning to end, of intelligence - there are no unnecessary scenes, little graphic violence, no sensuality, and very little crude language of any sort. Every scene has a purpose, and each one leads off to an ending that is both satisfying and perfect for a sequel hook. The apes, created completely with CGI using Andy Serkis's awesome motion capture work, were incredibly well done - I was particularly impressed with the orangutan! They are believable, living creatures onscreen, although there were some moments where the animation seemed a bit cartoonish, but they were far between. The music was well done, and the performances by all the actors werepractically Oscar-worthy by themselves.    All in all, \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" reminds me very much of old-school, thought-provoking, science fiction epics, updated for the modern day. It barely earned its PG-13 rating, in fact - the film is EXTREMELY tame compared to many others of today. Well-acted, taken seriously, a commentary on the modern world, and a wonderful film!
0756404738|4.0|I enjoyed this Book. Fortunately, I was able to read The Name of the Wind back to back with this book. I recently been on a reading \\"Binge\\" having read the complete Song of fire and Ice all the way through Dance with Dragons. Then I read the complete 1st Law Trilogy and the Name of the Wind and this book \\"Wise Mans Fear\\" just since April of this year.    All three series are very good. I highly reccomend all three. This particulary book just has a few items that were very annoying.     Spoiler alert!!    The multiple meetings between Kvothe and Deena unexpectedly was just totally unrealistic, I realize this is fantasy, but it jumped out at me how unlikely these accidental meeting could be and it just seemed really \\"Cheesy\\" Also way too much romance between these two. I have no problem with this part of the story line but it became trite and repetitive.    I would certainly put this series up with The 1st Law and just under G.R.R.M. 's Song of Ice and Fire.    These annoyances prevent me from giving it a five star review. 4 stars for me and highly reccomended
0345529057|4.0|Highly addictive.  Better writing than Robert Jordan and the \\"The Wheel of Time\\" series, but similar scope.  I will buy the next book in the series, \\"A Dance with Dragons\\".  Warning:  adult themes, bawdy descriptions of sex and frequent violence.  As another reviewer mentioned, this is not a children's  book. Like life--sometimes the wrong people die and for the wrong reasons.  This series is a picture of a society in chaos at a time when their world is about to be engulfed in an environmental disaster (think mini ice age).  Everyone knows that \\"Winter is coming\\" but they are helpless against their greed, lust for power and revenge as they proceed down a path of self destruction.

I hope that the rest of her life is filled with wonderful and beautiful things. May she find peace and much happiness with her girls and beloved mom. What a story of her young life.  I'm not sure that I could have survived what she had to go through.

Interesting, unsual and intriging something different to a lot of shows i have seen. If you are looking for that in a movie go for it.  Robyn
B003YL4L0W|4.0|Sixteen years ago, I wrote a novel about a custody fight over the child of a lesbian couple after the birth mother was killed. ([[ASIN:B002U0M54M In a Family Way]], available from Amazon as a paperback or Kindle e-book.) Her surviving partner and co-mother, one of three contestants for their baby, was a woman in her mid-forties who had lost custody of her older children solely because of her sexual orientation.<br /><br />Since that time, great strides have been made toward achieving equal rights for Americans who are lesbian or gay, including the repeal of \\"Don't Ask, Don't Tell\\" and the passage of same-sex marriage in six states plus the District of Columbia. Yet although much has changed, Jodi Picoult's gripping novel highlights how much bigotry and discrimination still exist. For in her very current novel, the mother's fitness to parent children is also challenged solely because she is a lesbian, married to another woman.<br /><br />Over two hundred readers have already posted reviews, and it strikes me on skimming them that quite a few seem to regard the book in a positive or negative light depending on their attitudes toward homosexuality and equal rights for GLBT (Gay/Lesbian/Bisexual or Transgender) people. So I'll state my own views up-front: one of my two wonderful daughters is a lesbian, and my husband and I also have a gay nephew who, with his partner, is doing a first-rate job of parenting their adopted son. And I certainly believe that my daughter and nephew deserve equal rights!<br /><br />Sing You Home is definitely an \\"issue book\\" in the proud tradition of older novels like Gentlemen's Agreement or Consenting Adults; as another reader put it, it shows a \\"political agenda\\" on Picoult's part. This is an agenda that Picoult forthrightly admits, as the proud mother of a beloved gay son, and to me it is a plus rather than a minus. Picoult does a great job of portraying Zoe and Vanessa as normal people, with all the virtues and flaws that other ordinary people have. And I was happy to see other readers say that the novel had opened their eyes to the roadblocks and injustices faced by GLBT people.<br /><br />But readers familiar with Jodi Picoult's earlier novels know that this author never writes books that are simply tracts, but rather well-plotted, compelling reads. Her latest is no exception.<br /><br />In Sing You Home, the custody fight is not over a baby or child who has already been born, but over three fertilized embryos being kept in storage at the fertility clinic where Zoe Baxter and her ex-husband Max have spent much time, and thousands of dollars they could ill afford, in hopes of having a baby. The story is told by three viewpoint characters: Zoe and her ex-husband Max, who are the contesting parties for the embroyos, plus Vanessa, the school guidance counselor whose relationship with Zoe starts with friendship but develops into love and marriage.<br /><br />As far as their readiness to be parents, the cards would seem to be stacked against Max. Zoe is a graduate of a prestigious school of music, who uses her talents in the helping profession of music therapist. (I was not familiar with this field and found the description of her work moving and fascinating.) Max, on the other hand, is a recovering alcoholic, with a faltering landscaping business, who walks out on Zoe after her most recent pregnancy comes heartbreakingly close to a successful delivery. But Max has an ace up his sleeve in the fight for their embryos. He doesn't intend to parent the potential baby or babies himself; instead he has found a couple with impeccable Christian morality, who he and his lawyers are sure will trump the standing of a lesbian couple.<br /><br />I found all three to be well-developed characters, though Max and Zoe interested me more than Vanessa, as both of them experienced profound changes in their self-identity during the course of the book. (Vanessa is most compelling in describing the pain of having to hide hertrue identity through much of her life.) Max is driven by a life-threatening accident to becoming a born-again Christian, and Zoe is stunned to realize that she is fully capable of falling in love with another woman. And though other readers have criticized Picoult for characterizing Vanessa and Zoe as nearly perfect, I didn't find them to be so.<br /><br />A number of other readers have criticized Zoe's outspoken intolerance of religion, and I agree with them. Walking out on Christmas dinner because Max's brother and sister-in-law emphasized the religious aspects of the holiday was not only rude but hurtful to both her in-laws and Max. (I tend to doubt that Jodi Picoult meant this to reflect her own views on religion; as a fiction writer I know that characters reveal themselves to writers, warts and all, rather than being made up from whole cloth.)<br /><br />But I also thought that Zoe's insistence on wanting to try to get pregnant again after the stillbirth -- even though her doctor strongly advised against it, saying another pregnancy would be life-threatening -- was a flaw on Zoe's part. Her demand that they go through another IVF cycle was the \\"straw\\" that prompted Max to leave her at such a traumatic time for her, but Zoe should have realized that his lapses back into drinking -- something she was aware of but ignored -- made him a poor source of emotional support.<br /><br />Max is weak, though hardly evil, and his account of the peace and support he finds as a newly born-again Christian fascinated me. Unfortunately, despite the support and acceptance he finds, the pastor of his congregation is virulently anti-gay, and it is largely at his insistence that Max goes to court to deny custody of the stored embryos to Zoe.<br /><br />I didn't feel, as some reviewers did, that the author condemned all Christians without distinction, but only the fundamentalist, right-wing churches that would demonize Jodi Picoult's child and mine for the orientation they were born with. The outlook of the congregation Max joins is closer to that of the Westboro Baptist Church, headed by Fred Phelps, which specializes in picketing funerals of fallen American service members, than to most mainstream congregations that I'm familiar with. And indeed, I have numerous friends who belong to accepting, welcoming Christian churches.<br /><br />Phelps' group came to my mind, incidentally, because Jodi Picoult placed them as onlookers in the courtroom, rooting for Max and his conservative lawyers to win. (This was something that surprised me - not that Phelps and his congregation would be against a lesbian couple raising a child, but that there was a large audience sitting in court throughout the trial. When I did research for the courtroom scenes of In a Family Way, I asked to sit in on a family court custody hearing, but was told the courtroom was closed to all but parties involved in the case.)<br /><br />It also surprised me that Picoult gave both Zoe and the woman Max announced his intention of donating the embryos to the same infertility problem of multiple miscarriages. Though it was acknowledged that the latter might not be able to carry the embryos to term should she become pregnant with one or more of them, it was brushed aside by her husband saying, \\"but maybe she can.\\" I thought the conflict might have been stronger if she had an infertility issue that kept her from becoming pregnant to begin with, but not in carrying a baby to term.<br /><br />And I also -- again, like other readers -- would have liked to know what happened to Lucy, though as she had only a year-and-a-half till her 18th birthday, she had probably left home for a better environment by the time of the epilog that ended the story six years later.<br /><br />But these are minor quibbles. I couldn't stop turning pages -- a turn of phrase only, as I was actually clicking the Next Page button on my Kindle -- to see how this conflict would be resolved. And maybe it's only becausethe endings to my own books have the same kind of twists, but I loved the ending Picoult came up with.Baptist Church, headed by Fred Phelps, which specializes in picketing funerals of fallen American service members, than to most mainstream congregations that I'm familiar with.

B004ZJZQH4|5.0|Apollo 13 has been one of the guilty pleasures in our household.  Every time it turns up on cable, we wind up getting sucked back into the improbably story of one episode of improvised brinksmanship after another.  It's easily Ron Howard's finest exercise in cinematic storytelling, sticking fairly closely to the actual story, going through all manner of fussing (including multiple trips on the Vomet Comet) to create an authentic look and feel, and making the most of a top-notch cast, underplaying their parts with intensity and focus.    We had decided to get this movie on DVD, and this set offers the best package so far.  The Blu-Ray edition is a replica of the 15th anniversary edition.  It looks spectacular on the screen, with even more striking, darker blacks than the HD cable presentation.  The audio presentation is equally impressive, and the presence of a standard-def DVD and all of the extras available on previous editions make this the edition to get, if you need a Blu-Ray edition.  The digital copy, alas, has a limited lifespan, but that feature wasn't such a priority for me.

0765365278|5.0|I didn't want to read this.  Another epic series that will surely take ten plus years to finish. What's a fantasy lover to do though, you know?  After having read the book, though, I DONT CARE how long this series will take.  I'm finishing it.  The prologue to The Way of Kings starts off with a bang.  That hint of world- shattering conflict and profound struggle between good and evil which drives the epic fantasy genre.  Yeah. You know what I mean.  Be warned, however, the next 300 pages are a little slow. Don't give up.  The time Sanderson spends in world-building and developing his characters is well spent.  Like the master he is, Sanderson slowly draws you in until you are wholly invested in the book. Plot twists in the back quarter of the work keep the action fresh.  The ending brought the prologue full circle and left me with chills.  Give me book 2 and give it to me now.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Finally, a book about Romans!!!  I have been waiting for a book on Roman mythology to come out ever since the Percy Jackson series came out.  In my opinion, Romans are way better than Greeks.  I am glad the same guy wrote it.  He is a very good author and I like how he added the Romans to Percy Jackson instead of making an entirely new series.  If you have read Percy Jackson, I would highly recommend this book.  I don't even need to tell you anything that happens in this book, because even though I have only known you for a few sentences, I can already tell you will like this book.  Plus, for all you Roman fans out there, on the cover of book two I can see a certain Eagle!!!                  What are you waiting for?  Buy the book!!!  It really is good, even if you haven't read Percy Jackson.
B0051MKMNC|3.0|From start to stop this is the noisiest film. Occasionally there are a few known pieces of music from classical masters. Yet for the most part it is obscure pieces of music overwhelming the dialog. Occasionally there is musicales spot where they still play jingles or extremely loud sounds of glass breaking or footstep noises.<br /><br />If you can get over the noisy background the primes is pretty good.  I would not want to presume on telling the producers how to improve this film but it is really too much like those soundbite documentaries were they do not complete a thought before moving on to the next thought.<br /><br />Basic story is Eddie Morra (Bradley Cooper) a going nowhere would be writer who stumbles in a situation where he obtains a substance that allows him to utilize parts of his brain that were previously unreachable.

1400052181|5.0|I'm adding my five stars to all the others who loved this affectionate and thorough investigation of a medical mystery and the fate of a poor family. This is a unique story of a unique woman's cells that live on thanks to doctors who treated her for free, yet also treated her as an invisible charity patient. The black families and white doctors in this book are drawn in with great balance. Baltimore in the 40s and 50s and the great hospital that dominates East Baltimore are well-depicted. A very moving portrait of what it means to be poor, and how hard it was for African American families who took part in the Great Migration to succeed. Highly recommended.
B004EPYZUI|3.0|This movie really goes where many movies have gone before.  It tries to be a deep story of an abused girl (Sweet Pea) whose stepfather puts her away in an asylum to cover up how he attacked her and her sister after their mother's death. During her attempt to save her sister, she accidentally kills her, brining much guilt. So now the rest of the movie is how does she live with this and escape from the asylum and gain freedom.

Many corney lines, a plot that is way to predictable, and a bunch of young girls in skimpy outfits.  That pretty much sums up the plot and movie.  In between, there are many CGI action sequences which are not that special in action, and play much like a video game, and integration wise between live actor and computer (blue screen), there have been better movies made.  All in all, I'm dissapointed I purchased the blu-ray. However, it appears the extended cut tried to fill in some of the gaps, and did so well, and I thought flowed better than non-extended cut. But unless you just like this type of film blindly, I would reccomend renting it first prior to buying the full thing, may save you a few bucks.
B001E7OO2I|3.0|I like John Legend's \\"Get Lifted\\" album better, but nonetheless it's John Legend so I don't mind listening to it. I like about half of the songs versus liking all the songs on the \\"Get Lifted\\" album.
0811875040|3.0|I am a retired professional cook. My training and experience has been in pastry and bread baking.  I loved the look of this cookbook and the idea of smaller sweets in the day of oversize portions. I have tried two cake recipes, the ganache recipe and attempted to understand the buttercream recipe, but I abandoned my ruined ingredients.  I have a convection oven, the proper pans, an oven thermometer, and 33 years of baking experience.  Both cake recipes failed. I followed the recipes precisely and carefully. I've never had such spectacular bad results.  Butter cake tasted fantastic but was so sunken I barely got four very thin layers from both pans.  The hot milk cake batter tasted great and sunk even more.  I have double checked oven temp and reread and reread the recipe and used all the instant read temp guidelines.     In summary, it's a lovely book and the cakes look so pretty. If I'm in San Francisco, I will certainly visit the source and I'm sure it will be wonderful. I will adapt the smaller size cakes using my tried and true recipes. Buy it only for the looks and some ideas.
1451629184|5.0|I feel honored and privileged to have been able to read Jaycee's firsthand account of her captivity. I wanted to read her book because I was so impressed by her grateful heart from the ABC interview. I wanted to learn where she got that. While I didn't learn that, I did learn it was consistent throughout her captivity and to all the people who helped her after her rescue.    She prefaces her book by saying it may be a confusing book to read and for those who can't handle that to come back in ten years when she has gained more perspective. I didn't think it was confusing at all! I wasn't expecting a literary piece, I was expecting to read a book written by a girl with a 5th grade education. She doesn't mention her girls a lot because her main goal has always been about protecting them as much as she is able. Maybe they will write their own book one day.    The book is very graphic and very painful to read. Philip and Nancy's attorneys tried really hard to make their clients look not as bad as they really were and Jaycee needed to set the record straight.     In a world of constant abuse and isolation, her cats were her only source of true unconditional love and affection. What amazed me is no matter how many times a cat was taken from her, she still invested a lot of love and training into each new cat. After painfully losing a couple dogs I asked myself, \\"Why invest in so much training if I am just going to lose him/her?\\" I admire her resilient spirit.     There is a verse quoted from the Bible in the book. I don't know what book Philip was reading, but it definitely was not the Bible. Jaycee's only perspective of the world was the one Philip taught her. She believed he was all knowing which made any thought of escaping seem impossible. Perhaps Jaycee's grateful heart is a product of the Stockholm Syndrome, but from my own life I have learned that very difficult situations are more easily navigated when I can find at least one thing to be grateful for.     Jaycee included her hand written journal entries. Reading those made her captivity all the more real. It wasn't so much what she wrote, but how articulate she was! Her spelling was better than many adults I have seen!    This review was written mostly in response to the one star reviewers who I wonder if they even read the book. Seriously. Denying or sugarcoating evil doesn't make it exist any less. I would never deny anyone the right to expose it for what it is.     As someone who was physically and verbally abused, I found Jaycee's book inspiring and easy to relate to.
B001PPGAIA|3.0|Although this movie didn't get good reviews from the professional reviewers, it's well worth taking the time to watch it. This is probably the best acting that Nicole Kidman has done to date and Hugh Jackman continues to ace every part he plays.  The story takes place before the second world war in Australia, naturally.  Whatever you didn't know about Australia and the aborigines and what the Japanese did to Darwin, you will know when the movie is done.  Although sometimes the Aussie accents are a little difficult to understand by the time the movie is over you will know exactly what has taken place.  It was interesting to see that the Australians were not a lot better to their aborigines than we were to our Native Americans and the black slaves.
B001L51RQE|3.0|What happened to the excitement of the guitar in Message in the Bottle? What happened to the creativity that we saw before in So Lonely? This is a disappointing concert.  It all sounds just a little too controlled.
0061997811|5.0|I was working for our local YMCA this summer and a child brought the book with him one morning.  The other counselors and I were all hovering around him and looking at the book.  I then proceeded to order it from my cell phone while we were still there.  I have loved reading every page.  As a huge Harry Potter fan, having grown up with the characters, I loved getting all of the behind the scenes information that I didn't know about the filming and all of the actors/actresses.  It was a terrific book, for a very reasonable prices.  It comes with all sorts of exciting things that completely come out of the book, like the Marauders Map, Harry's Acceptance letter to Hogwarts, and a whole variety of other things.  It is a terrific book!
044654759X|4.0|Good, but not like Sparks previous books. Not as passionate and I was able to guess what was going to happen.
0786955716|4.0|So after reading several of the reviews on here, I went ahead and purchased \\"The City\\" Dungeon Tile kit.  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the pieces, but I do definitely think it could be a better set.<br /><br />To those who are saying there are no roof tiles I'd say this, the box itself is designed to be cut up into your roofing.  You lose your box that way (which is unfortunate), but that's where the roofing is.<br /><br />Now on to my main complaint: I would have liked a wider variety of parts.  That is to say, I'd rather have had two sets to buy: The City and The Sewer.  That way \\"The City\\" set would have more options for buildings and outside areas.<br /><br />Now obviously they won't be able to build a set that pleases everyone, so here are some things I think you should know going into this:<br /><br />1 - You aren't going to be able to make small buildings with this, and if you do manage to make one, you may not be able to make more than 1.<br /><br />2 - If you're wanting to build something that's bigger than 2' x 3' you will probably need more than 1 set.<br /><br />3 - If you're going to buy this, consider how you are going to keep the pieces together first.  If your group is anything like mine, tables get bumped and things move around.  If you don't have a way of securing everything in the place you put it, things could get jumbled.  (More on this below)<br /><br />4 - I would have paid a little extra if they had come with a dry erasable finish on them.  As it is, I'm toying with the idea of putting some clear contact paper on them to allow for this, as sometimes the environment is going to change beyond what these tiles are capable of (I'm coming from using a set of gridded whiteboard tiles).<br /><br />In regards to securing them, what I've done for now is to put them on a large sheet of felt, and then used borders consisting of cardboard with velcro to hold everything in place.  Things could still move, but it will take more than a casual bump.  I've got another idea that I'm going to try that will involve a cheap coffee table and corkboard and thumbtacks to hold things in place that I may try also.<br /><br />I haven't actually used these tiles yet in a game, so I'll post an update if my opinion of them changes beyond the creating layouts I've done so far.
B002OFWG7O|5.0|Love it. It stays close to the cd and dvd players. Long live the Foo Fighters. It arrived on time.
B000LC55F2|4.0|This is a movie that leaves you thinking about what really happened.  A lot of people will want to watch it twice to catch all the things that might have been missed the first time around.  It's ostensibly about two illusionists trying to outdo each other.  They begin as friends, but break up when one of the two probably causes the death of the other one's wife.  From that point on, they do everything possible to make the other one's life miserable.  Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are both excellent.  It's hard to figure out which one of them is the most evil by the end.  Good plot, good acting.
B003L77GRO|3.0|Of course I love Dexter, we all do. But this season was a complete mess and a violation in every way of the rules the Dexter Morgan character lives by and upon which the story arc flows.<br /><br />Bottom line, and WARNING I'm going to blow the arc now, the idea that Dexter would completely open up to the Julia Stiles character...and then when she decides, um, I feel better, lets her just leave? So that at any time she can stop by a police station and turn Dexter in? I mean really.<br /><br />The Dexter Morgan we know from the outset, who lives by his father's rulebook, item one being \\"Don't get caught\\", we're supposed to believe that a cute blonde movie star is going to get him to toss all that into the crapper? And not kill her when she wants to take a hike? Not MY Dexter.<br /><br />What's all wrong with the show is the constantly changing writers. They've gone from superb writers to crap writers. Where is Melissa Rosenberg? PLEASE save the show. PLEASE!<br /><br />And a small point, but in the first two seasons, in the outdoor scenes, people sweated. Their shirts were wet with sweat. It's Miami. Now they're all dry as a bone. Come off it.
B005A1ER0I|5.0|This album is one of the best I have ever owned. Words really cannot describe how wonderful, ethereal, and sublime the music hits the emotional and mental feelings of a human being. It doesn't matter what time of the day you are listening to this album. It transcends you to another level, and when finish it makes you to crave more of it. Thomas Bergersen wrote his music to inspire people, and I must admit that he effectively did so! A purchase worth having.
B000059TCE|5.0|A good alternative to trying to find 101 Dalmatians in a traditional manner.  With Amazon.com not only was I able to purchase this movie, but I also was able to get 102 Dalmatians along with 101 Dalmatians.  Thanks, Amazon.com for your help!
B0059R5Q08|5.0|I loved the attention to detail.  From the Homes that they used, the kitchens, the court yards, the furnishings and the clothes, everything looked authentic.
0316069485|5.0|I received the book timely. It was in great condition!  I am pleased with my experience with Amazon.com  THANKS! What else is to be said, it is a good place to purchase  books both new and used.
0307946711|4.0|I was inspired by the trailer of the movie to look for this book. I read it in two days and enjoyed it a lot but found it a bit slow. When the major twist took place at the end, as unexpected and random as it was, I found it surprising enough to justify reading through a slowest book hoping the ending will make it worthwhile. While I was not too fond of either character, the story told was very realistic, which I did enjoy tremendously. I would get angry at them, cheer them on and ultimately got to really like them. I do highly recommend this book!
B004HO6I4M|4.0|This is a children's movie and I am rating it as such.  It is a great movie to watch with the whole family.  In our case, even our bird watched it with us, and got all excited with all the chirping going on in the movie.  :)<br /><br />One word to describe this movie would be colorful.  All kinds of bright colors.<br /><br />A rare blue bird is captured by poachers and brought into the US.  A Brazilian ornithologist follows the trail and brings the bird back into Rio, Brazil.  Along the way number of new characters are introduced with at times outrageous adventures.<br /><br />We liked it, thumbs up!
B004UIOUHC|5.0|I used the native browser my Viewsonic gtablet came with, Dolphin and Opera Mini.  Opera is my favorite.  It is fast and easy to use.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Angry Birds is probably the easiest and most addictive game to come out since Tetris. It works GREAT on my Motorola DROID 3. The ads were tolerable until Rovio changed it to where the ads actually pop up and pause the game. SHAME ON YOU ROVIO!!! The pop-up ads completely ruins your rhythm when playing the game. The 99 cents it costs to get rid of the ads is well worth it. My 5 year old is totally hooked on Angry Birds and it only took him 5 minutes to master the game. This game is fantastically fun for ALL ages. It was very easy to purchase and download thru the Amazon Appstore. I got the FREE version of the game from the Android Market and ALL my saves carried over to the ad free version. While you're at it, I HIGHLY recommend picking up Angry Birds Rio and Angry Birds Seasons.
0553801473|4.0|Loved this book, wish they combined both book 4 and 5 to lesson the tedium of crows... but its a great book containing all the character you know and love. Just hope we don't have to wait another 5-6 years for the next book because the author is busy with the HBO show.
B004UXUXGE|5.0|...........and I intend to own the DVD, and give it as a gift to friends and family. Herzog and the French government have given the human race a priceless gift in this film. I hope that this wonderful film is only the beginning and similar films will be made about the larger caves of Altamira and Lascaux. The art in Chauvet cave is both older and quirkier than later caves. I found myself envying the scientists who make this cave their study - they seem to be some of the happiest humans alive. I did have one slight criticism: the instrument they refer to as a 'bone flute' made from a vulture's bone and tuned - amazingly enough - to the pentatonic scale, is actually a PENNYWHISTLE, still in use in European folk music.
B004GYY714|5.0|Im able listen to local, international radios live from all over the world. Better than satellite radio.  Best part is its all free.
B004BLJQOK|3.0|This film is so similar to the original that it is hard to see the reasoning behind remaking the same movie.  I had seen the original Swedish film Let the Right One In some time ago therefore I did not remember all the details.  Still, it was as if I was watching the same movie again.<br /><br />If you like the vampire movies, it is a very good movie.  One caveat: it is not a typical slasher horror movie.  It is more realistic, which makes it more scary.<br /><br />It is amazing to me how much detail exists out there about vampires, a made-up-creature.  Who comes up with all this stuff?  You have to invite them into your house, otherwise they can't come it.  The sunshine will catch them on fire.  They have to drink blood to live.  Only silver bullets will kill them.  They never age.  It really is endless.  And, of course everybody knows these *facts*.<br /><br />Check out the original.  I am not crazy about vampire movies and therefore I ranked this movie three star, but if you like horror movies this could easily be four or five star movie.

159514188X|5.0|I got an e-mail from amazon about the top young adult books and this was one of them.  I started reading the sample pages they had on the website and I was hooked.  When the sample pages ended I couldn't wait to buy the book.  I had this book built up as an amazing book that I wouldn't be able to put down and it delivered. It may be because it hit close to home with me, but even if I hadn't I would probably still love the book.  Definately a must read!
B000LB7G00|5.0|I work on CATIA V5 8+ hours a day and started having full-arm aches and pains in November 2010. I ordered an Evoluent Vertical Mouse for my right hand in December and the pain went away. Fast forward to July 2011, the pain is back. I bought the SpaceNavigator to spread the workload between my Right and Left hands. It works great for panning, zooming and rotating. The actions on the screen are very fluid and smooth. I was worried that the unit would slide around on the desk but the motions required to input a command are so subdtle and the base looks to be a solid, stainless steel ring, it does not move at all. I still have pain in my right arm, but not as intense as I am not performing click-hold-drag operations with my mouse during pan/zoom/rotate, the SpaceNavigator takes care of those functions. It is not a cure-all, as other environmental factors contribute to my discomfort (desk too high, chair too low), but my company's ergo team is working on those issues. One drawback, I have to manually launch the software BEFORE I launch CATIA V5 in order for the SpaceNavigator to work. If I forget, I have to close, launch the software, and reload my parts. Could be because CATIA V5 is not listed as a supported software or because of how CATIA V5 is setup at my company. Not a huge deal, just something to get used to.  UPDATE: I contacted 3Dconnexion about CATIA V5 issues listed above. Never heard back from them. Good product, horrible customer service.
B002ZG976U|5.0|Cher is a has been.  Never a good singer without gimmicks, in my opinion.  My wife wanted to see the movie so I went.  I was blown away by Christina Aguilera.  She was great.  Had the movie had someone other than Cher it would have been a great movie.  Cher needs to stick to her specialized singing because her acting sucks.  Every word sounded as if it were being read from a script.  No acting there.  Christina Aguilera in the other hand did a superb job and I had never paid attention to her as a singer but in this movie she blew me away.  Forget the lame plot but see the movie to hear Christina Aguilera sing and her acting was pretty good also.  A thumbs up from me but because of Christina Aguilera.

B000H6SXMY|5.0|Soy un fan&aacute;tico de la Serie FRIENDS desde que la TV por cable nos permiti&oacute; acceder a ella en Colombia, donde resido (a trav&eacute;s de WB Channel); su humor me parece supremo, as&iacute; como sus personajes, car&aacute;cter&iacute;sticas, interrelaciones, situaciones, etc.  Por eso, al ver este producto no dud&eacute; en adquirirlo para tener la posibilidad de verlos y disfrutarlos una y otra vez, pues no me cansan y me r&iacute;o de sus chistes y situaciones como si fuera la primera vez.  Al recibirlo qued&eacute; totalmente satisfecho con el producto como tal:  la caja exterior es muy bonita (tal cual como se ve en la fotograf&iacute;a promocional, y en el buen estudio fotogr&aacute;fico referido por un comprador) en rojo granate con las fotograf&iacute;as de los personajes y el debido r&oacute;tulo.

B004EPYZZ8|1.0|I was very sad at the immodesty in this movie. It had only a few Christian undertones, but was overall very worldly. I have a problem with a \\"youth leader\\" showing cleavage at a worship service (or anywhere for that matter), and all the SKIN shown so close up. I personally know of brothers in Christ who chose not to see this movie after hearing about it, because they had struggled with pornography in the past. It was just another example fo the \\"worldly church\\" to me. We'll dress like strippers, have a pretty youth counselor with low cut clothing, add a few lines on prayer or \\"you can do anything\\", then we'll get the world AND the Christians to spend money on this movie. We may even deceive the church into showing it at their \\"movie night\\". God help us! I don't mean to be grim, but my heart grieves over what \\"Christianity\\" has become these days and this is just another example of that very thing.  Basically, I think it was just another big money raiser with a little bit of God mixed in to draw the Christians. I am disappointed that the Christian radios promoted it as they did. :( If you are serious about your walk with Christ on the straight and narrow, I would caution you not to even bother watching it. It has great potential to cause a brother to stumble.
B000P0J02E|5.0|This is a rich and triumphant score - worthy and fitting for the final of the first three films.  While the first film's slightly purer, more direct themes and instrumentation may still stand the test of time as the quintessential Pirates music, this score is thicker, richer, and more epic in tone and energy, again very fitting for the Worlds End film.  It is also one of the best scores from Zimmer in recent years. While all of his work is quality and enjoyable, this score is refreshingly full in composure and range compared to much of his recent more monotone atmospheric explorations (in scores such as Inception, Sherlock Holmes, The Dark Knight, etc).  Though as another reviewer pointed out, you can hear certain themes and sounds starting to emerge in places of this work that become a big part of some of these later film scores. In any case, this is a very strong and enjoyable work.  It even captures some of the feel and emotional strength of his work for Crimson Tide, which for me, was one of the scores that first drew me to Zimmer as a composer.  I highly recommend adding this album to your collection! 5/5
1451629184|5.0|After watching the interview on TV, I was very interested in reading Jaycee Dugard's book.   Such an honest, frank story of what happened to her.  All those stolen years can never be regained, but her account may help keep it from happening to another child.
B003Y5H5A6|5.0|This was a movie that Icertainly enjoyed. The lead role in the movie is a character named Steve Rogers. He constantly gets rejected  from joining the Armed Forces. He is finally accepted thanks to Dr. Abraham Erskine. Dr. Erskine wants to try a procedure on Rogers. This  procedure is done in New York. Rogers comes out of the procedure taller and more muscle bound. He isturned into the ultimate soldier.  A Nazi spy in attendance kills Dr. Erskine but is captured by Rogers.  Rogers becomes Captain America and is used as a public relations gimmick despite his new physical powers. Colonel Chester Phillips played by Tommy Lee Jones suffers a loss on the battlefied and 400 men are captured. Captain America(Rogers} leads a daring rescue   mission and saves the men. This is where he meets up with the Red Skull(played by Hugo Weaving). This immediately calls for a showdown.  After the death of Roger's childhood friend at the hands of the Red Skull Captain America hops into action. This results in an action packed finale. There is a surprise ending as well. See this movie.

0375758992|5.0|Some background first: I'm studying memoir as a genre and therefore have been reading them one after another for the last couple of years. I've always been drawn to the genre, so I am perhaps biased, but I will say that there are a lot of examples out there that do not measure up. They are entertaining to a degree the way that it's interesting to hear about other people's lives and adventures, but if the storyteller is only average, then there is something lost in the conveyance of their experience.<br /><br />Ms. Fuller conveys beautifully and, I believe, accurately what it is like to grow up in 1970s and 80s Africa, the child of white colonialists. The heat, the bugs, the filth and the beauty are all intertwined here to make life in Africa a palpable experience for the reader. In places the prose is so beautiful that I had to stop and reread whole paragraphs to soak in the author's love of the African countryside. The characters are eccentric, bold and audacious. I finished this book in three afternoons - a rarity for me. The last time I committed myself to finishing a book that quickly was when I picked up Krakauer's Into Thin Air.<br /><br />Ms. Fuller says that this was meant to be an ode to both Africa and her mother. I believe that she succeeded on both counts - whether you love her mother at the end of this book or not, I could see, through the author's eyes, how her mother was possessed of a strength of character that few women can muster under less trying circumstances. Were it not for this strength she surely would have succumbed to the pressures of loss and uncertainty that their family constantly found themselves operating under.<br /><br />The author is also quite funny and I laughed out loud several times...and then she would pull the carpet right out from under me and send me into a blubbering fit of tears (twice).<br /><br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants a feel for what it's like to live in the tropics among a people with whom you share little culturally or anyone just looking for a good read. I wait with baited breath, the prequel to this book due on on the 23rd of August, which examines her parents' lives in greater detail.looking for a good read.

B003JTHESA|5.0|What can I say about Iron Maiden that has not already been said ? One of the greatest bands in Metal history keeps rockin and sounds better than ever. Great album . Great sound . Took me a couple of listens but once i really had a chance to listen to it this album blew me away. I'vee been listening to Maiden for over 20yrs and I gotta say The Final Frontier is worth listening to over and over again.
0802798225|5.0|Brittany Ellis has a seemingly perfect life from the outside. Others are jealous of her good looks, boyfriend of two years, rich family and mansion of a house. But what they don't know is that she's faking it all. As her home life is crumbling apart, so is her relationship with her boyfriend Colin. And to make matters worse, on the first day of senior year she gets paired up with gang member Alex Fuentes in chemistry class. The two are from different parts of town and are constantly at each others' throats. But when Alex makes a bet with his friends that by November he can get Brittany to sleep with him, things turn around. Suddenly, Alex is always on Brittany's mind and he can't get her out of his own either. As the two begin a secret relationship, they realize that maybe they aren't so different after all.<br /><br />This was a unique blend of Romeo and Juliet meets West Side Story. One thing I loved about this book was that it was told in both Brittany and Alex's point of view, alternating chapters. I was able to see both of the characters' home lives and cultures, and grow equally close to the main characters. They were deeply developed and almost right from the beginning I really connected to them. I could relate to Brittany and her struggle at plastering on a smile, while I could also understand Alex's reasons behind being in a tough gang to protect his family.<br /><br />I hadn't ever read anything by this author before so I wasn't quite sure what to expect. Her writing blew me away though, and left me hungry for more. Simone Elkeles has such a talent of weaving together an interesting plot, steamy romance, unforgettable and compatible characters, and words that flow perfectly together. There was never a dull moment in the story, and even the tiniest of details seemed to play a role in the book. Even me, someone who is completely turned off by profanity, didn't have a problem at all with the many f-bombs included in the dialogue. And that's because the author used them when needed, to make a point, and to bring the story even more to life. Alex is a bad boy - he has tattoos, scars from knife fights, wears a bandanna with his gang colors, and talks tough. But I swear he'll melt your heart. The passion between Alex and Brittany was so raw and real; I believed every second of it. I do think the ending was a little far fetched and dramatic, but that doesn't lower my 5 star rating of this fantastic and emotional novel. I enjoyed every page of it and recommend it to all you mature romantics!needed, to make a point, and to bring the story even more to life.

0785814531|5.0|From the research I've done before buying a collection of his works this one seemed to be the best buy and I was only reassured of this after the book arrived. The text is a good reading size not too big not too small, but this is coming from a 20 year old so it may be harder to reader for people with poor vision. Another thing is the book it kind of big, thick wise, which was expected at the time of purchase so it's not a bad thing for me. Although, having a big book does cause arm fatigue fairly quickly when reading. Other than that just a great overall book that I would recommend to any fan of his writings!
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Hello All,<br />This is another movie I had to go and see on opening day, Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors and did he deliver another outstanding performance in this thriller, WOW. As soon as the movie started I was glued to the screen until the credits came up, that's how good the movie was. This film has it all, suspense, mystery, drama, and a little thrill all in one. I thought the entire cast worked well together; and Frank Langella was classic as an antagnoistic character. I wasn't expecting the twist near the end, which made the movie much more exciting. Who would have thought the true identity of Neeson would be that of a terrorist, I'm just glad he was able to change at the end. Another great movie in 2011; and it wasn't a superhero one either, this year we have been bombarded with superhero movies. I like those type of movies, a couple is fine, but 8 is a little 2 many, and it's just August.<br /><br />THX,<br />-Kris L. CocKayne

0393339882|4.0|An excellent discussion of the evolution of physics from the turn of the 19th century until 1960's told through the lens of leading up to Bohr and Einstein's disagreement about quantum physics. Bohr believed there was no real world in the quantum world but just the world observed by the observer. Einstein felt like physics job was to map the real world. While he agree with Borh's copenhagen interpretation and Eisenberg's uncertainty principle, he did not believe they fully explained quantum mechanics. The book closes by suggesting that the discipline has still not resolved this conflict.    The greatest strength is that Kumar explains some complex physics phenomena step by historical step so that you can see how each experimenter develops his research and conclusions. The biggest weakness is a lack of summary at the end of the chapter to pull all the disparate people, ideas and principles together.

B0042JIL1U|3.0|I have to say that I found this recording disappointing. Why wasn't it produced on 1 CD? The total length is only about 70min for all 6 Concertos and I have CDs that have a playing time of that length on 1 CD. This is also my gripe regarding the CDs available for Handel's Israel in Eygpt. That on runs for 60 min yet all the available recodings are on 2 CDs. I find that a real nuisance. It so happens I saw this concert of Bach's Concertos on TV a few years ago. A brilliant concert and I thought this was going to be the same but just on CD. It just did not sound the same concert even though the performers and conductor were the same.
B003YL4L0W|5.0|I have only read a few of Picoult's books, but this was the best of the one I have read, including My Sister's Keeper (which I also loved).  It is a controversial issue, but unlike other reviews, I did not see it as one-sided.  Yes, there is one controlling, religious character who has a strong political agenda, but the other characters on that side of the issue are acting on the basis of their personal truth; their motives are based on good intentions and firm religious beliefs. There is no right or wrong here, just perceptions.  Unfortunately, the two main characters have very different worldviews, and so it is up to a judge to step in to issue a decision.  I loved everything about this book!
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|this Cd is just lovely...   Loreena comes through once again with her haunting voice, beautiful instrumentation, and lyrical prose.  I just adore her so much.

0307946711|3.0|Picked up this book on vacation.  I wanted to read it before seeing the movie.  Loved the book until the end.  WHY, Mr. Nicholls??? Needless to say, now I don't want to see the movie!! Call me a hopeless romantic but I was hoping for a \\"Happily Ever After.\\" Our lovable heroin Emma was finally happy and then BAM!!  I was so pissed, I wanted to throw this book across the room. I know the movie will leave me just as upset...so why bother.
0786856297|5.0|This book is by far the best book I have ever read. When picked up this book I didn't put it down for 3 hours. This book is pure genius. I love the way Rick Riordan wrote this book so much, I think he should win the noble prize. I recommend this book to everyone especially to people who like learning about ancient cultures. If you like magical comedies that have ,endless action you would love The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan.
B002VECMAE|5.0|This movie is far out and not for everyone. Some people will find the content objectionable or just too strange. It's based on nonfiction which makes it all the more bizarre. Having said that, if you are a person who enjoys watching eccentricity in motion, I think you will get a real kick out of Goats. The characters are representative of multiple persons who were involved in the unusual CIA operation and the actors do a fine job of capturing the essence of their roles. I must applaud the stellar performance by Goat.<br /><br />Ewan McGregor is an inquisitive journalist who wants to know more about the recently declassified information pertaining to the government's secret activities. He meets up with Clooney who tells him about the Jedi program (chuckle). Clooney convinces him that the two of them share a destiny and McGregor joins him on his zany mission. Jeff Bridges portrays the guy who founded the First Earth Batallion. Supposedly, the idea came to him after he fell from a helicopter while serving in Vietnam. He was injured by enemy fire and as he was being taken away to safety, he had a vision that said \\"your gentleness is your strength\\". He pursued the meaning of the vision and created the CIA program to conduct research and experiments so the US government could learn how to use a variety of mind over matter and mind control techniques. Bridges' character is present in the now, but in a slightly spaced out manner. Spacey is a smirky Mr. Know-it-all wannabe. He is a thorn in the side to the other guys, or as they say on Carol Burnett's show, a splinter in the windmill of your mind. Clooney's character is gifted with mental abilities and his performance is fun to watch.<br />The movie gives you a glimpse into the secretive CIA operation.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|There are lots of bothersome logistics issues that nag at an otherwise wonderfully done series that makes it just short of truly groundbreaking (if they're so short on gas, why are they driving so many vehicles???  for just one example).

B00544L9EI|5.0|Eminem and Royce da 5'9\\" are absolute masters of their art.  They created a taught and fresh take on the original theme for their music, which was first heard in the mid nineties.  Over a decade later it's still moves me and crushes all competition along the way.<br /><br />The best way to describe the sound on the album is devastating.  It's like watching the best in the world take on the rest of the best the world has to offer and just crushes them.  Think Mike Tyson vs. Leon Spinks.<br /><br />5 Huge Stars!<br /><br />By the way... Bruno Mars \\"stands out like a green hat with an orange bill, but I don't get p*ssed\\"  Not in a good way either.  The chorus to \\"Lighters\\" is nauseating.  I have to fast forward to get to Em and Royce's parts, which are very good.
0740797719|5.0|This is an amazing book. Gurney did an amazing job of explaining concepts that I only had a vague awareness of. It's a great instructional resource but it's also intimidating because you get a glimpse of just how deep the rabbit hole really is. You will become a better painter by familiarizing yourself with the concepts that are outlined in this book. You will also be humbled when you see just what true masters like James Gurney are really capable of and gain a whole new appreciation for them. This book provided more insight into painting technique than my four year BFA program.

B0051T47NQ|5.0|--------------------------------------<br />\\"Troll Hunter\\"<br />--------------------------------------<br />This Norwegian film is a fun combination of horror film and faux-documentary, exploring a world where trolls are real and are (secretly) managed by the Norwegian government as a nature conservation issue, much like flooding, wild wolves or avalanches.  The troll issue is kept from the public though, and it is only by chance that a young student film crew stumbles on the one man who is charged with keeping trolls on the reservation. The troll hunter named Hans is played by actor Otto Jespersen, with a cool, calm reserve that helps hold viewers attention.  Hans seems to have an agenda, but it's never quite clear what it is.  After combating (and occasionally massacring) the trolls, he breaks the government's silence, and lets the hapless college kids follow him and film what happens.<br /><br />The filmmakers balance elements of comedy and horror, and skillfully underplay their hand - they know audiences have already seen similar films (Blair Witch Project, Cloverfield, etc.) so they don't rely to much on the \\"documentary\\" gag. Similarly, they judiciously withhold the special effects so that they don't get old. They also don't make them too groovy -- the trolls look both amazingly and comedically weird, just weird enough that you think, \\"they look just like illustrations from an old fairy tale - what if \\"real\\" trolls really looked like cartoon figures?\\"  They also inject just enough tragedy and tension tht the film doesn't feel like a joke.  If the premise sounds good, you'll probably enjoy the movie and it's slowly-unfolding narrative and inconclusive ending. Also, the filmmakers seem to have positioned themselves for both a prequel and sequels... I wouldn't be surprised to see a comic book come out of this as well.  (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)
B002ZG993Q|5.0|If you are looking for a fast paced, action flick - skip this one. Otherwise this is a great movie, very atmospheric, great scenery, and a nice twist ending.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This band is fantastic! I really love their CD Sigh No More. They have a great sound that is sometimes blue-grass, sometimes rock-a-billy.
B000026OW3|5.0|I know what I like, and I like this set of recordings!  Rubenstein knew the music of Chopin intimately, and it shows in these fine recordings.  Of the 11 disks, only one has recordings from 1946, and it has been digitally remastered so the sound is good.  The remaining disks have recordings from the mid-50's to the mid-60's.  They too have been digitally remastered and the sound is impressive!  [For those readers who were not around in the 50's and 60's, we had impressive sound, not the scratchy recordings of the 20's and 30's.]  Rubinstein was a master interpreter when it came to the music of Chopin. I have disks performed by other artists, often excellent, but Rubinstein remains at the top.<br /><br />  Often, I read reviews from self-proclaimed experts who think their expertise is the end-all of advice.  I'm not saying their comments should be disregarded, but use caution and common sense when reading such advice. One reviewer says that the music Rubenstein produces is boring and will eventually put you to sleep. It just doesn't affect me that way, unless it is indeed bedtime.  Many times I find that the vast majority of reviewers are entranced by a recording, with one or two nit-picking a magnificent production.  There are nit-pickers in all fields - recordings are not exempt. This is true value - in cost, and in listening experience!
B0006LZPLC|5.0|Been a fan of Keens for a few years, on my 3 pair, but still like the original Newport style the best.  All around best comfort and toe protection.  Only thing is they don't grip as well I would like sometimes.  I'm still using my old pair regularly though for day-to-day with the new ones for hikes through the creeks.  Love not worrying about going into the water at all.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An explosive wrap-up to a very enthralling trilogy. I was drawn in from page one. I can't say enough good things about the Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mockingjay. Suzanne Collins must have a love affair with the keyboard because she produces some mighty brilliant text. I consider The Hunger Games a must read. And read again. I'm looking forward to the movie. I really hope they do a good job of it.<br /><br />Mockingjay went a new direction from the first two installments. We still have our heroine, Katniss, and her vastly different but intriguing potential mates, Gale and Peeta. President Snow is still villainous, but new threats from unexpected quarters enter the picture. I was totally caught off guard on more than one occasion and this pleases me. I hate being able to keep pace with a story and foresee what will happen next. I adore the twists and turns, the unexpected hurts and joys and the oh-so-NOT-Hollywood ending to this epic, epic tale.

0060558121|4.0|\\"When the Old Gods died, there Arose the New Gods\\" - Jack \\"The King\\" Kirby<br /><br />Neil Gaiman's novel, \\"American Gods,\\" plays on an old idea which, as stated in Kirby's classic Comic 'The New Gods,' is about the old vs the new, evil vs good.<br /><br />Only what side is right, and which side is wrong?<br /><br />Gaiman's novel is extremely detailed and establishes powerful characters and powerful relationships. The main character, Shadow gets out of jail due to the sad words \\"your wife is dead.\\" He wanders out of the jail, after serving time for a botched bank robbery, and gets on a airplane where he meets, by chance, a man named Mr. Wednesday. Mr. Wednesday is a strange man, who knows more about Shadow than Shadow is comfortable with.<br /><br />After burying his wife, Shadow encounters Mr. Wednesday and a friend, who turns out to be a leprechaun, and is drafted into a war, called \\"the storm.\\" The storm is approaching, and it is a fight that is of utmost importance, a fight between the old gods of the old lands, and of the new gods of television, internet and cellular phones.<br /><br />The idea isn't terribly original, but it is told in a refreshingly interesting way, and Gaiman succeeds with flying colors. The characters and story are developed well, slowly becoming solid characters, slowly growing and building muscle atop a rather weak premise. Just about the only complaint I have is not really a complaint at all, but, around the middle things seemed to grind to a halt for a few pages, but it was quite literally the smallest of problems, and is therefore not really a problem.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading the book and truly enjoyed the author's style. I can't wait to read more by Mr. Gaiman. Well played Mr. Gaiman, well played.
B004GJDQT8|2.0|So the only time I ever use this app is if a friend is talking about an item they can't find. I always pull out my phone and see if Amazon has it and then tell them to get it on Amazon. I have made a couple of one click purchases on it in an emergency but otherwise I never use this.<br /><br />I pull Amazon up on my browser because this app really only has 2 functions: search for items, one-click. I can't view my orders, my account, track packages, or anything like that.<br /><br />I would just like to have more options that what is provided. Also, the layout is very difficult to navigate. I mean, if you are a loyal Amazon fan like me I'd download it just to have it but don't expect to use it much.<br /><br />99% of the time I just pull Amazon up on my phones browser since the app is so useless.

B003L77G6A|2.0|The first two and a half seasons of The Big Bang Theory were good. That is true, I believe. It managed to rise above the morass  of crap on most broadcast networks and be just good- not exactly a glowing review, but more than you can say for most of the TV out there.     However, the back end of the third season and this season have suffered from a noticeable decline. I'm not really sure exactly what changed, but it's mostly because of three things:    1) The Flanderization of Sheldon  At the show's inception, Sheldon was nowhere near as socially bereft as he is in S4; he's just a very smart, somewhat awkward guy with an admittedly large number of personality quirks. However, when this was spotlighted as the funniest thing in the show, it was ratcheted up several levels- and this actually worked for a time. In season two (the best season), he's at just the right level of obnoxiousness and social neurosis. However, by now he's nothing but a generally insufferable man-child who can't even hold a simple conversation. He's still somewhat funny, granted, but he has to carry the show most of the time. Why?  Because...    2) Leonard is a Jackass  Like with Sheldon, Leonard has been cranked up to 11. Observe-  Season 1 Leonard: Easily the most normal of the 4.  Season 2 Leonard: \\" \\"  Season 3 Leonard: Slightly more jerkish, but not enough to seriously disrupt the show.  Season 4 Leonard: Egotistical jerk-ass who complains about everything and fails to actually be funny.   But basically, Season Four of TBBT is just    3) Too much like everything else  As I said earlier, The Big Bang Theory first popped out to me because it was funnier and better than most everything out there. But the writing is sloppier, the characters are more broadly drawn and Flanderized (ex: Wolowitz' perversion, Penny's 'stupidity') and it's just not funny. Granted, there were a few good episodes (\\"The 21-Second Excitation\\", \\"The Justice League Recombination\\"), and I generally liked Bernadette and AmyFarrah Fowler (except when she only served to highlight just how 'whacky' Sheldon was). But it didn't click for me this year, and I don't know if I'll tune in again.    Full Disclosure: I missed most of the second half of the season's original broadcasts because of a conflict with Community (8/7 ct. on NBC!), but I have seen 17 of the episodes including the last 2. Feel free to malign me for it in the comments    Grade: 2/5

B003Y5H5FG|5.0|[[ASIN:0767817664 Fright Night]] is my favorite vampire movie, and one of my favorite movies of all time. I wasn't sure if a reboot had any chance to work. After seeing it today, I have to admit that I am very impressed overall.<br /><br />Colin Farrell's Jerry Dandridge was much more menacing than expected. Although we do find out more about this Jerry than Chris Sarandon's, Colin's isn't suave and has no humanity - he's just a cold killer.<br /><br />Charley Brewster, his mother, Amy and Evil Ed (now Lee instead of Thompson) are better developed and more believable in the 2011 version.<br /><br />David Tennant's performance as Peter Vincent is a highlight of the film. His knowledge of vampires and collection of artifacts and weapons is pretty substantial. My only disappointment with this Peter Vincent is that he didn't find his faith, which was what the original was all about to me.<br /><br />The story has been brought out of the 80s, and hopefully will appeal to modern audiences who wouldn't appreciate the original like those of us who saw it in theaters.<br /><br />Lots of suspense, and the action barely pauses once it starts. Of course, the special effects are much better than the original (really glad they kept the huge vampire mouths - they still creep me out!), and the 3-D was well-done and fun.<br /><br />If I had a choice of which Jerry I'd rather live next to, it would definitely be Chris Sarandon's. He didn't hesitate to turn into mist or a bat, but had compassion and seemed like someone who'd be interesting to hang out with.<br /><br />I'll definitely add this to my collection as soon as it's released, and am already looking forward to seeing it again. Plenty of opportunity for a sequel. Hopefully this time we'll get a Fright Night 2 worth watching.
B0039TD7PY|3.0|I expected to hear classic renditions of our favorite songs from Taylor, instead it was his \\"not quite the good stuff\\" songs, so I was VERY disapointed with his part. King on the other hand delivered exactly what I wanted, all the favorites and done to perfection!

0812974611|4.0|I love intelligent thrillers and this certainly fit the bill. It's a tension-filled countdown to the eruption of Vesuvius.     Who will survive? Will the evil Ampliatus continue his reign? What happened to the former aquarius Exomnious?  These are all questions that will gnaw at you until the very end.
0857680986|5.0|This is a great book on several different levels. As a guide to drawing the human figure, it is unsurpassed and contains formulas, tricks and theories that would help anyone who wants to learn how to draw people. As a piece of nostalgia, the text is interesting because this book was written in the 1940s for commercial artists. In particular, the \\"ad layout man\\" who had to know how to draw people for comp work.<br /><br />As for myself, I bought the book to help in the life drawing class I'm taking. If you're involved in figure drawing, this book is a must have.
0439023491|5.0|I love this book.  The author is brilliant.  I couldn't imagine a sequel that could top the first book, but this one takes the story to a whole new level.  Warning... if you read this one, you'll have to read the 3rd (and you better have it ready immediately).
0061726826|5.0|I found this book in my local book store and chose it as i was getting fed up with the vampire/werewolf books which contained shallow and not very well thought out protagonist females with no mind of their own.  Although the story began more slow paced, i feel it helped to create more of an atmosphere for the type of world the book is set in. I found it more realistic as Lena slowly realised what was really happening rather than just agreeing straight away, creating a character with more of a personality, rather than a shallow unbelievable one.  I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I agree it was beautifully written. The ending had me in tears and I cannot wait for the second instalment next year.  I would really recommend reading this book, and staying with it despite its slightly slower start.  *****
0553801473|4.0|OK. So this book isn't Storm of Swords, Clash of Kings or Game of Thrones. It's still really good. Great characterization, better dialogue. Sure the book suffers in comparison to the first three, but it's head and shoulders over nearly all other fantasy out there. Taken together (as they should be), Feast for Crows and Dance with Dragons moves the story forward, has some nice reveals and fleshes out the unbelievably well-constructed ad rich history and lore of Westeros. I do wish Martin had a stronger editor who would keep him a little more focused, but I'm enjoying this world, am not disappointed in Dance with Dragons and am looking forward to the next installment.
006176759X|1.0|Sorry Lauren Conrad, but this book should be written for 18 year olds. It is soooo boring and brainless. Another reason why I probably never watched the Hills. There is no information that is new, no climax or depth. Do not waste your time or money.
0786715103|3.0|I found this to be a great book. You may also want to consider Chris Okoli's Africans Cry for Help.  It sheds much needed light on the history and happenings of the African continent. With virtually all regions of the continent embroiled in some form of civil and economic strife -- be it the events of the recent Arab Spring in the north, issues of apartheid in South Africa, civil war in Sudan, or the government corruption and despotism that plagues many African countries -- Africans Cry for Help brings the reader the much needed history, perspective, and insights required to truly understand the issues that have become synonymous with Africa today.     Beyond providing an in-depth historical understanding of the European colonialism of the past and the economic colonialism of the present, Okoli exercises his airtight knowledge of the nuanced problems -- as well as their origins and trappings -- that define a modern Africa in crisis. The solid aforementioned foundations make his vision and proposals to remedy issues such as the lack of inter-African cooperation, tribalism, economic dependence, the African diaspora of the 1960s and 1970s, and the lack of support for African youths all the more compelling.    If you are in need of primer, or are looking to continue the conversation on African issues today, Chris Okoli's Africans Cry for Help is a must read. He brings the understanding, insight and perspective that are essential to any book you will read to understand Africa and its future.

0545259088|5.0|The conclusion of an amazing trilogy. Grace and Sam have seemingly switched lives from when we first met them. But there are great dangers coming to the Boundary Woods in Mercy Falls. Sam and Cole must find some way to make things right. Save the rest of the pack, and figure out how to stop the mass murder of everything that they hold dear. Isabel is trying desperatly to figure out what her feelings are and just what to do with her life.     With Sam being under suspicion in Grace's disappearance it seems that all eyes are on the Beck household and the people that are within it. But can they save everyone they love in time? Will they ever be able to be together properly? How will it all end?    This was the perfect conclusion to a series that has found it's home among my favorites. Written in beautiful red ink, Stiefvater brings to life the characters that we have gotten to know from the very first book. Sam, Grace, Isabel, and Cole are back again for the third and final installment to an amazingly beautiful series. The wolves of mercy falls are in danger. And it's up to Cole and Same to make things right and figure out how to save everyone. It's time for them to put on their thinking caps. With clever character development and great plot twists Stiefvater definatly keeps the reader guessing.    I read this book in a day. It was so smooth and every time I got to the end of a section I just wanted to push on and go foward to find out what was going to happen next. There were no slow moments in this book, it was action packed all the way to the end. Character development was pivitol in this book and I think it really made things even that much better. The series is done, and for that I am sad because Stiefvater definatly created a world of beauty, simple love, and the wonderful story of wolves. But I look forward to more of her works and definatly regard this as stellar work!
B00003CXAW|5.0|King Kong is a masterpiece of American cinema. This DVD is a great transfer of the film and the bonus features are extensive and informative. The detailed recreation of scenes (including the lost \\"spider pit\\" scene) by Peter Jackson's crew are an amazing look into how this film was made. To see how hard it was to recreate effects from the 30's with modern technology, it gives you a whole new level of respect for the original.
0316776963|5.0|Me Talk Pretty One Day is the 6th book of collected essays by David Sedaris. In part one, Sedaris touches on speech therapy for his lisp at school, guitar lessons from a midget, inherited traits, artistic talent, sibling swearing, family pets, working as a teacher, toilet legacies, odd jobs, eating out in NYC, visitors to NYC, outward appearances, and technophobia. Part two focuses mainly on his life with his partner Hugh in France and explores travelling to France, taking French language lessons, feast days, the sex of words, Hugh's childhood in Africa, word puzzles, movie subtitles, the behaviour of vacationing Americans, epic daydreams, food economy and IQ tests. My favourite chapter was Jesus Shaves. I tried to read this to friends but dissolved into laughter every time. Sedaris has the reader constantly smiling, chuckling, giggling and often laughing out loud. Sedaris is witty and clever and reading his work is an unalloyed pleasure.

B00151HZ3S|4.0|After reading several reviews of this recording, I was a bit skeptical about listening to this at first, but I ultimately relented and figured I would give it a try.    Most everything said about this recording is true (and then some), both good and bad. Eva Marton is a truly HORRIBLE Brünnhilde, screaming most of the time, and even at her best she cannot even match Hildegard Behrens(!) or Nadezda Kinplova(!!!) despite having a significantly larger voice. She is simply a bore and her \\"involvement\\" in the role matches that of Pavarotti and Sutherland (in other words, hardly at all). Most of the cast is truly boring. Eva-Maria Bunschuch is too large and deep to be Gutrune, and she sounds a bit too much like Marton. John Tomlinson is not a bad Hagen, but he does not match the main competition of Matti Salminen. Thomas Hampson is not bad as Gunther, but Bernd Weikl will always sound better to me. Cheryl Studer (a fantastic Gutrune for Levine) plays Sieglinde here, and although she does a wonderful job dramatically, she does not have the right sized voice for my taste, and like Gundula Janowitz, is a significantly better Gutrune (whose voice is meant to be small, but exceptionally beautiful). Peter Haage and Kurt Rydl are not bad as Mime and Fafner repsectively, but cannot match Zednik and Salminen. Theo Adam, a common Wotan/Wanderer dating back to the 1960's, takes on Alberich, a move that has often been criticized, and although I never cared much for his voice, this is not an extremely bad performance, and is actually an interesting perspective and he is actually fantastic at points. He may not be the nasty little bastard that Gustav Neidlinger made him in to, but he makes me wonder about casting Hans Hotter, George London, or Hermann Uhde in the role just to see how it would sound. The supporting cast has its moments, but not always, in particular, Peter Seiffert and Andreas Schmidt are fairly uninteresting as Froh and Donner. This is all I will say about Reiner Goldberg: AAAAAAAAGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!! (well, at least he has less sound time than in Levine).    There are good moments in the cast, however. James Morris is not the greatest Wotan ever, but his strong and commanding voice are wonderful, and anyone who has seen Levine's video recording knows why he was so wonderful in the role on stage. Matti Salminen is fantastic as always, Marjana Lipovsek and Waltraud Meier are successful in their respective performances of Fricka (and Waltraute for Lipovsek), and Heinz Zednik once again struts it as Mime (I admit to preferring heldentenors in the role, but Zednik and Gerhard Stolze do such a wonderful job it's hard not to like them). The Rheinmaidens do not reach the same heights as others (Böhm has the best on record by a marathon, thanks to the high profile Helga Dernesch and Sieglinde Wagner), but are delightful.    Siegfried Jerusalem is a mixed bad when it comes to any of his roles. His voice is fairly unimpressive and hardly comparable to heldentenors of previous years, but he knows how to use it successfully (his career did last into his 50's after all), and his performances as Siegfried are good in their own right. His death scene is truly exceptional. He does not deserve to be discounted any time soon, and with the possible exception of Ben Heppner, he is one of the best post-René Kollo heldentenors out there (Kollo may not be that impressive either, but I have always liked him).    Now for the part of the cycle that makes this truly wonderful. Bernard Haitink's conducting. It is truly unique and reaches heights that although different from Solti's and Böhm's. He takes a swift and light approach to the score, letting is float along briskly, and never letting it drag on. It does feel a bit too light at times (the funeral march does not contain the same force as Keilberth's whose approach is similar enough to compare). He knows the score well and shows it. His Ride of the Valkyries is one of the best I've heard (it's also the easiest part of the score to play along with the Rheingold prelude), and the finale from Siegfried is hardly lacking anything (except a decent Brünnhilde) and it's mastery is truly comparable to Furtwängler and Knappertsbusch who could perfect it in their sleeps, and I can see Melchior and Flagstad performing to this performance in their prime. At least one review I read said that he has one of the most \\"right\\" ideas of how to handle the score, and he certainly does (my first choices will always be Solti, Böhm, and Keilberth though since they are heavier).  Haitink is truly an incredible conductor and deserves the respect of critics and any Wagner fans for his mastery of the work (I can see him working with Cosima, Siegfried, Winifred, Wieland, and even Richard Wagner themselves!).    The set is worth buying for its incredible sound as well. The acoustics are set back as if it were a Bayreuth recording, but much more detailed and lush, and it sounds absolutely gorgeous, and much more successful than Levine's in-your-face style. The sound production would also make John Culshaw proud for its use of thunder and other sound effects, and is actually somewhat more successful since it does not sound as cheesy. The Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra also takes top prize for its fantastic performance, but it always manages to be successful at Wagner no matter who is conducting so its accolades are hardly necessary.    Overall, this is a decent cycle, hampered only by a rather lackluster cast (Levine's wins by a mile, but it would be even more if Jerusalem was cast instead of Goldberg as Siegfried), and helped by a few fantastic players and an extremely skilled conductor, and is definitely worth looking into buying as a later cycle. For first choices, though, I recommend Solti, Böhm, Keilberth 1955 (if you can afford it), and possibly Levine (only on DVD since you get a Jerusalem as Siegfried instead of the horrific Goldberg, and Christa Ludwig in an additional role).
1416596585|5.0|This book was really amazing. It covers the founding of the company by the two Stanford students up until Eric Schmidt's departure as CEO, covering important topics and products such as China, Gmail, infrastructure, and of course search. The author really goes into detail and provides many quotes from different employees to really give you a sense on how people at Google view ideas and what their outlook is. It definitely gave me a greater amount of insight into a lot of the decisions the company has made. The book covers a lot about the mindset that set's Google apart, ranging from the hiring process to the quirks but also includes insight into more serious topics such as user privacy. A really good book!

B005BZQS1E|4.0|Sure, there are plenty of penis jokes and sexually based plots/discussions, the humor is crude and crass, etc....Let me ask this...knowing what you know about the genre, why would you watch this movie if you didnt expect that. I cant claim to understand the negative reviews that disparage the movie because of that.<br />To me, it was exactly what it was supposed to be: an irreverent romp through a medieval setting mixing today's lingo with a tale of yesteryear. Personally, i thought it was hilarious. McBride was himself of course...kind of a dick, but also a lovable scamp. James Franco is charming as always, and has a way of portraying good willed innocent wide eyed charm like no other actor out there. Then, you also get Zoe Deschanel and Natalie Portman, two goddesses as far as I'm concerned. You get some surprisingly cool looking wizardry and fights, some funny dialogue, and a sexually charged theme, not to mention some awkward bad guys, and even a minotaur's penis.<br />Exactly what the doctor ordered. I cant in all good conscience give it five stars, because it is incredibly silly, but it definitely deserves four. I had fun watching it.

0312330537|5.0|This was the most amazing book that I have ever read. The book is very long and still kept me captivated throughout the entire read.

B004CIIXC8|2.0|When I was 12, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie The Tracey Fragments (even though it has received a good amount of bad reviews). It was like I had been waiting all my life to see it - to know that someone else in the world could be having the same crazy things I had experienced..and to know it's sometimes alright to feel hateful, ungrateful, and depressed. This was because I found the situations, characters, and emotions GENUINE. My point is that Fish Tank failed to live up to my expectations.<br /><br />I cannot remember all the reasons why Fish Tank doesn't appeal to me, so I will simply refute its laudatory reviews and anything else I find overrated.<br />-Just because a teenager lives in a not-so-nice building, enjoys drinking, and dropped out of schools does NOT mean that she is a \\"victim.\\" To be honest, I was upset/jealous at how nice her room looked, how casual her mom was, how she owned so much money to buy booze all the time (plus her clothes and music player), and mostly how she could practically do whatever without her parent calling the police on her or nagging 24/7.<br />-Mia is definitely not a \\"passionate street dancer.\\" She just sways around unsynchronized with the music and doesn't seem to work hard on anything. I thought it was hypocritical that she messed with those other dancing girls and kept on chuckling whenever her mom's boyfriend kept on saying \\"I think you're great.\\" Watch Take the Lead if you like lower-class, teenage dancers.<br />-What was she thinking when she tried to \\"rescue\\" the white horse? Let it run away and either get captured again or starve to death?<br />-It is uncertain that Mia had a \\"rough\\" childhood because she seems to frequently roughen her little sister's childhood. If she really knew how arduous it was to grow up and cared for her sister like at the end of the movie, there would not be a detached attitude between them.<br />-Why does Mia keep on messing with others? She seems to have never been slapped, robbed, or threatened with a weapon.<br /><br />To finish for now, I cannot sympathize with Mia or the lack of depth in the storyline. Viewers are left without understanding why each character acted the way he or she did.inish for now, I cannot sympathize with Mia or the lack of depth in the storyline.

B002SJKWZ4|5.0|I am really impressed with how this worked out. I bought this for my wife, an avid Harry Potter fan, and she loves it. There was a little bit of consternation setting up the moves and commands from our myriad of remote controls, but once we figured it out, she was swishing away saying ridiculous things like \\"Poweronamus\\" and \\"Volumupicus\\".    Even I, who am not an avid Harry Potter fan, got into it. I was responsible for \\"Poweronamus\\".

B002KKCW86|5.0|These sandals are INCREDIBLY comfortable.  The sole is made of a soft rubber that comforts the feet while walking on any surface.  The bottom is also made of rubber, but is more firm and provides excellent traction.  Another reason these sandals are comfortable is that there are three velcro straps that allow you to customize your fit.  The inner side of  these straps is cushioned to avoid irritation.    I also own a pair of Columbia Techsun 2 Water sandals.  I liked them very much as well.  They are cheaper, but aren't near as comfortable as these Teva sandals.  They are less adjustable and have no cushioning on the inside and that did cause some irritation (not so much as to make me stop using them).  They are a good alternative if you want to save some money - they are $20 cheaper.    I got these Tevas in Bombay Brown because they were on sale, and they are very attractive.  They are more orange than brown, but they aren't too bright in color.    To sum up, If you are looking for the most comfortable sandal available in the $50 price range, get these Tevas.  You WON'T be disappointed.  If you are looking to save money, the Columbia Techsun 2 Water sandals are just fine too.

B000JIHP88|5.0|There were so many mobiles available- and we chose to get the Rainforest Peek-A-Boo.  We are so happy we did!  There are two levels of music- and with the higher setting you can hear it across the room- so it is plenty loud- as you want relaxing noise and don't want baby to stay awake.  My daughter has made friends with all of the animals and giggles with delight at them for a long time- it is easy to leave her in the crib an additional 20 minutes while getting ready in the morning because the mobile will entertain her.  There are four sound settings to chose from- the natural sounds (my husband likes to think of it as camping) and the soft music for the other.  The mobile can be turned off and the music plays only, or just the mobile.  The light is soft as you don't want it to keep baby awake- it is the perfect light for when our daughter is getting tired.  Not to mention the remote that can be used to restart the mobile if it stops...  We are so happy we decided to go with this one- the colors, sounds, and lights are perfect for our daughter.
B001FB4W16|5.0|My wife new about this series and since we don't have HBO, she had never seen it, but wanted to, so I purchased the first season for her as a gift, and we both enjoyed ot very much.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|Beautiful by definition is delighting the senses or mind.  That is what Beautiful Disaster did for me.  It delighted my senses and my mind.  It was a book that hooked me from beginning to end.  I fell in love with the characters and like a train wreck happening I knew I should have looked away but it kept me captivated.<br /><br />Jamie McGuire has quickly become one of my favorite authors.  I read both Providence and Requiem which put Jamie on my radar.  After reading many reviews for Beautiful Disaster I just had to read it for myself.  Boy, am I glad I did.<br /><br />Jamie McGuire knows how to write a character.  This book offers Travis Maddox.  Travis is the man you know you should stay away from but he just draws you in.  He is tattooed, strong, good looking, and intelligent.  He is quite the package. Abby is the girl who is trying to change her image from her past.  She is smart, beautiful, and a little secretive.  She falls hard for Travis against her better judgment.  Their relationship is one of ups and downs.  Someone might even label it as codependent.  The pair of them are beautiful when they are together but it is disastrous when they are apart. Abby and Travis have become one of my favorite couples.<br /><br />Although I will sing the praises of this book, I do have to say that I did get a little irritated with the breaking up and making up.  Since this was a book I wasn't too hard on the characters because I was entertained.  If this had been happening in real life I would have advised Abby to seek counseling for codependent behavior.  But I digress.<br /><br />A good book is going to give the reader a buffet of goodies.  There was hot romance, fights, betting/gambling, breaking up and making up, friendship, dysfunctional families, and love.  I sampled every bit of it and walked away content.  This is one of the best reads of my summer.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.
B000A2W1X2|2.0|As this is my favorite movie, I thought I would order it from Amazon to keep it forever.  The ordering process was easy and efficient.  I received the movie within two weeks of the date of ordering.  I was surprised to see that the DVD cover was 90% in an Asian language.  I was worried that the movie would be in another language other than English, but I was relieved to find that it was in English with subtitles that you could turn off.  I do think that it should be clearly stated that this product was for the Asian market but it still could be viewed by someone who only understands English.

B0051CSIKQ|5.0|If you are a fan of post-apocalyptic films, mixed with ravenous, mutant Vampires and crazed militant fundamentalists, then Stakeland is for you. Jim Mickle and Nick Damici were the creative genious' behind the After Dark film Mulberry Street. This talented duo know horror film and understand genuine horror fans. Stakeland is a very visceral, realistic feeling movie that deals with more than simple genre scares and gore. The relationship between Mister and Martin is symbiotic and emotional although shielded. The very act of survival brings to mind the grittiness of Cormac Mccarthy's \\"The Road\\". The vampires are grotesque and ravenous in their feedings. There is a fair amount of gore for the gore hound as well. The imagery of a broken, devastated American homeland is brilliant and sobering. All in all, Stakeland is a must see for any vampire, doomsday film fan.
B005CMSDKA|1.0|This is by far the worst movie I've seen in a very long time.<br /><br />It tries to create a story, which at first keeps you interested, but then half way through the movie, crumples and falls apart, taking you on an endless run (literally) that's as far from interesting as can be - it becomes utterly boring and you lose all interest in it. Very seldom do I feel like I've wasted time when watching a movie - this is one of those occasions.<br /><br />The acting is good (for the most part), but having good actors perform on Titanic won't prevent it from sinking.<br /><br />I collect movies and will buy nearly anything, but this one will not make it to my collection, simply because I will never ever watch it again.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|There are almost 3000 reviews of the Hunger Games on Amazon already, and the overwhelming majority of them are 5-star. So what's one more review worth?    Probably not much. You've already heard of this book, all your friends have probably told you to read it, and maybe you just haven't gotten around to it. Or may be you're sick of all the hype, and you think this is just one more pop-culture misfire, another crappy corporate novel churned out for teens and tweens and those adults still developmentally stuck in their high school yearbook.     Believe the hype. The Hunger Games isn't just a good book, it's a great book, and it's going to be around for a long time. It's dark, complex, constantly screwing with your expectations, and it sticks with you long after you put it down. This is the real deal.     If you hated Harry Potter for its vanilla characters, convenient plot devices, coincidence overload, and corny macguffins, The Hunger Games will wash all that badness right out of your soul. Suzanne Collins pulls no punches. It's sweet, painful, brutal, and beautiful writing. Be ready to buy the entire trilogy.

B004WESFZW|3.0|Great acting by Matt Damon and Emily Blunt is the only thing that kept me from putting 2 stars instead of 3 at the top of this review. The Adjustment Bureau is a silly, convoluted story that suggests human destiny and fate are not a result of freewill, but rather controlled by a bunch of federal agent looking dudes in fedoras. Our entire lives are written in a script and if at any point it looks as though we may go off script the fedora wearing dudes are there to make Adjustments to ensure that we stay on path.<br /><br />While carrying a concept that sounded kind of cool with a trailer that made the movie seem like an action / sci-fi flick, it turned out to be more of an oddly placed love story in the middle of an action / sci-fi flick. Damon shines as a presidential candidate that becomes aware of the Bureau due to his path going off course in the form of a romance with Blunt. The dialogue between Damon and Blunt was entertaining and fun to watch, but the weird \\"Damon wants to be with Blunt; the Bureau doesn't want him to be with Blunt; the Bureau will now go through a magic door and change your destiny\\" dynamic got tiring and I found myself poking holes in the plot the whole way through the movie versus sitting back and enjoying the show.<br /><br />So I would say don't put The Adjustment Bureau at the top of your queue. Let it linger at the bottom for when you're out of other ideas.
B003UESJH4|4.0|I waited impatiently for the DVD on \\"The King's Speech\\", and was happy when it  arrived.<br />As a child I lived in England at the time of the action, and remember listening to the king as he fought his way through his regular, Christmas speech. It was painful, but he did his best, and he certainly did his duty. I lived in London throughout World War Two, and the royal family was always in the thick of things. They even toured the bombed out areas of London to encourage the people, all the while German bombs were dropping on their own home at Buckingham Palace.<br /><br />The Speech starts slowly, but then Colin Firth takes over in a very realistic way to let us see the king's agony when speaking in public. You have to know, or remember, that King George the Sixth had never been groomed to be king. That responsibility fell to his older brother who became King Edward the Eighth. Edward turned out to be an irresponsible neer-do-well, who quickly abdicated. So the speech impediment of the second in line should never have come to the fore.<br /><br />The movie progressed well, but my wife and I were badly turned off by repeated and shouted obscenities on the part of the king while his tutor was helping him to shed his stutter. We are sensitive to gutter talk, and avoid films that are R-rated because of that, especially when we can't walk away from it, so we cringed for a long minute of screamed foul language.<br />We certainly weren't expecting it, and it shows the disgusting mindset of the director of the film, because it was all unnecessary in such a sensitive film. He just wanted to ram his tasteless world down our throats.<br />Such a shame too, because the movie was quite marvelous in depicting the tragic side of a good and famous monarch. Firth was outstanding, as was the tutor Geoffrey Rush, who deserved his star billing. Helena Bonham Carter was competent, but was poorly-chosen for the part of the queen, being much too young. Helen Mirren would have done it beautifully, but had already made her mark as the queens's daughter, in her astonishing portrait of Queen Elizabeth the Second, in the movie \\"The Queen\\".<br />The movie was well-worth seeing. I notice that the many enthusiastic reviewers of \\"The King's Speech\\" don't mention the shouted and prolonged foul language, so it was not a problem for them.

B004SMDJ9U|5.0|Haven is the best show on SyFy.  I'm a huge fan of Stephen King's books especially his classic works. I love that the writers of Haven reference his books in each episode.  Haven is fun to watch, unique to other shows on TV and always keeps me coming back for more. Check out Haven if you haven't already. Watch out because it's addictive.

B001V7R09A|5.0|This is a magnificent 9-disc collection of the 20th century greatest piano genius who started touring Europe, Japan and America shorty after his native country Russia freed the World from Nazi plague. Unfortunately, a group of American hooligans (of propaganda hirelings) staged an infamous rowdy disruption of Maestro's performance during his 2nd US tour. They were scum who used Art for their petty political pursuits, shouting ugly slur at the face of the Artist, who was about to open them his heart. Sviatoslav Richter vowed that he would never again set his foot on American soil, and he kept his word for the rest of his life. He would often go on tours to Europe and Japan but America was crossed out from his heart. This is why this collection is a chance for Americans to hear Richter's legendary play uninterrupted and to send to Maestro, however belatedly, American apology.    There is only one teaspoon of turpentine in the barrel of honey: Herbert von Karajan's barbarous conduction of Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto #1 on the disk #6. There were rumors that Karojan had a sick ego and resented other geniuses, or maybe he was just too much into Baroque and unable to tackle great Romantics. I have some CDs with Karojan conducting Bach's Brandenburg Concerts - there he is good. But here he just butchered Tchaikovsky and was constantly obstructing Richter's play.  So, just donate the disk # 6 to a local library and enjoy the rest - it's superb!

I think just two of the cuts alone are worth price of admission (and as others have already said...playful in spots that brings out a side of Buika I was not even aware of...)  With Buika and Sr. Valdes playing off each other it gets very wonderful (is there a proper word?)  If you like voice and piano, you should have this.

B003L77GRY|5.0|First off let me first say that this season is far different than the others. SMALL SPOILERS!!!!!!! A lot of people didnt like this season because dexter takes on a sort of partner in julia stiles. While I like dexter going solo as well i thought they played this story line of him having a partner very well. I like the fact that in this season the main bad guy dexter is after is not just one guy but a group of guys. they are Very ordinary and successful men committing violent crimes showing us as a viewer that not everyone is what they seem. This season takes a couple episodes to really get going and to show us what the main plot line will be. When the season picks up it does not slow down. All in all another great season of dexter that does not let up.

B004SMD4H2|5.0|I wish someone had told me about Haven last year, so I could have enjoyed it earlier. I found it by accident when Syfy run six episodes to fill a Saturday slot, and a visiting grandchild recorded them.    I was hooked by the fourth episode. The opening credits \\"Previously on Haven\\" included scenes I had not seen. I promptly hit the pause button and opened Amazon, where I found this complete set. I had it in two days.    Haven has been described as Twin Peaks meets the X-Files, only better. The stories are great, the scenery is spectacular and the whole cast is remarkable. Stephen King fans will enjoy the little tidbits thrown in several different episodes.    I highly recommend this series. Already signed up for season 2 as soon as it is released, and watching it every Friday on tv. So happy to say it continues to be entertaining. Give it a try, you will love it!

B003Y5H542|4.0|This is the story of a domesticated, delusional chameleon left alone to die in the desert.  Except, instead of dying, he stumbles upon the dried-up town of Dirt, where water is more precious than gold, and life hangs by a precious, dwindling thread.  Our hero, a fan of cinema and improvisation, dubs himself Rango, and quickly becomes Dirt's latest sheriff.  This isn't the dream job he imagined, however, and soon he becomes enmeshed in a web of violence and deceit from escape may require the ultimate sacrifice.<br /><br />Owing as much to CHINATOWN as to the classic westerns it lovingly rips-off, RANGO is a real treat.  Gore Verbinski's direction is surprisingly solid; he's never been a consistent filmmaker, but here he hits his stride and stays mostly steady.  There's a bit too much slapstick early in the film; this is clearly to engage the interest of younger viewers, but make no mistake: at its core, RANGO is not for children.  It's violent and provocative, with mild language and some thoroughly disturbing images.  Most of the darker stuff is understated (to the film's great credit), but it's definitely there.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is clearly the star here; he gets a little campy in spots (again, targeting the young'uns), but at some points you can forget who's voicing Rango, and simply enjoy the character as another of Depp's personae.  He's joined by a select group of talent: Isla Fisher, Alfred Molina, Stephen Root, Ned Beatty, Abigail Breslin, Ray Winstone, Harry Dean Stanton, and Timothy Olyphant doing a spot-on Eastwood.  Kudos go to Bill Nighy as Rattlesnake Jake; his performance serves as a textbook example of how to act using only your voice.<br /><br />The film is riddled with references to other westerns and Depp films, but truly, it stands on its own.  It could be a little edgier and darker (if they'd gone for a PG-13 rating, for example), but as is, it's a refreshing, riveting western that just happens to star a lizard.  If you're put off by the animation, don't be; this isn't just a kid's movie, it's a film for anyone who loves a complex, rollicking good film.  Maybe not an Oscar contender, but damn if it isn't one of the better animated movies to come out recently.n't just a kid's movie, it's a film for anyone who loves a complex, rollicking good film.

B0050PYNP8|5.0|I was cautious at purchasing this DVD. In trepidation I pressed play on the remote, settled back in my comfy chair hoping for the entertainment I was looking for. The map, the 2 pommies, the science fiction show in the USA, they were eager to see all, a dream 2 mates dreamed of doing from a young age. Paul entering the movie on a long deserted highway is so funny, then later where he says goodbye to all his new friends you wish there was more to watch. This DVD has made it to my Favourite DVD List. I've only watched it 3 times so far, each time I find something else I enjoy about this movie. All I have to worry about is the DVD doesn't wear out from me watching it over and over again, or that one of my kids \\"borrow it\\" (haha) and it's gone forever.  Great work to all involved in making this movie and I hope they make a Paul number 2 movie
B003Y5H53S|3.0|The quality of the DVD was great, packaged nicely, and came undamaged.  The movie itself, however, left alot to be desired.
0307454541|1.0|It took me months to finish this book.  The characters are unsympathetic, undeveloped and impossible to remember / put into context (given there are so many and their names are all alike).  I forced my way through it, foolishly believing that all the fuss \\"had to be warranted\\".  It's not.  Flat plot, no momentum, poor grammar, not one likable character, and the ending was uninspired.  A waste of my time.

Regardless, I found the notes absorbing and enlightening, without too much distraction. If I wished, I could read through without looking at every note.

If you have read this classic over and over, and seen the movies, then add this to your collection, because each *view* adds to your enjoyment of a beautiful classic.
B004Q3SGWG|1.0|I have loved Danny Boyle movies up to now.  Maybe it's because he finally won a well deserved Oscar for Slum-dog Millionaire (an accolade he should have won much earlier with Trainspotting), but this movie seemed to me to be his 'I won an award and now fancy a paid vacation in the desert so I will latch on to this story about a true American a-hole and spin it out over 90 mins with drivel and a few effects' movie.  Let's face it - the protagonist deserved to die for his own misadventure, and by doing so would have become a true American Icon by leaving his skeletal  remains dangling from a rock in a rarely visited canyon!   Wow - What a tourist attraction and legend he might have become.  Instead here is the story of what transpired:   (Spoiler coming - though it may save you from a bad movie)  A-Hole bounces over-confidently across and through canyons - slips and falls while disturbing a rock that also falls and traps his arm under its weight.  Maybe he should not have been here alone, or maybe he should have told somebody where he was going (a basic rule for exploring the great outdoors).  Fast forward... We, the audience, now need to endure countless dull, meaningless flash-backs of 'happier' times with friends and family while he figures out a way to escape. This tedium takes 127 hours, during which his facial hair never grows and he keeps smiling to himself on his camcorder!   He eventually determines that his only way out is to cut his arm off!  As he leaves both his arm and the canyon he allegedly says 'Thank You' - presumably for the millions he thinks he might make from his TV appearances, book and movie deals.  So - fall down canyon, weep a little, contemplate knife, cut off arm - could be done in a 30 min. movie.  Verdict: Waste of time!
0307716511|5.0|OK, this author can write. Love the prose, the voice that she chose (big sister writing to little sister). I became convinced that she (the author) must have experienced grief over someone who passed away in her life, and that she knows the sad story of cystic fibrosis (a disease that I have worked in research in a biotech company for). Her writing was compelling, but not self-indulgent. If you like a story about relationships, about siblings, about a mystery that is a nightmare for those involved, then read this. She pulled out all of the stops for this. Kudos.

This guy doesn't even read, so I listen to him and man i'm glad I did.  The character development is great, I found myself caring for almost all the contestents she talks about.  It's pretty amazing to becuase the book is only 300+ pages long.  Not a long read, took me about 5 hours to read the book from start to finish.  Now i'm on the second book and I hear it just gets better from here on out.
0307279189|5.0|Born to Run by Christopher McDougall is one of the best books I've read this year, and I'm not even a real runner. My friend recommended this book to me two years ago, and told me that it was a story of a tribe of excellent runners in Mexico. I thought it sounded interesting, but never rushed to read it. When I was in the States this summer, Born to Run came up again and again in airports, bookstores, and my conversations. I thought it was time to read it, and I'm so glad I did.<br /><br />My friend was right that there is a tribe of super-runners in the book, but that is far from the whole story. The frame story of the book is the author's experience with runner. The book begins with his visits to several doctors to find treatment for his many running injuries. He is told many times that running is bad for us, and that we all are injured. His only solution, he was told, is to quit running or get a few cortisone shots to relieve the pain. McDougall was not ready to give up on his sport, so he began a search to run better.<br /><br />Throughout the book we meet the Tarahumara runners from Mexico, a cast of characters involved in ultra-running (any race more than a regular 26.2-mile run, usually 50 to 100 miles), and the strange, elusive Caballo Blanco, a white man from Colorado who lives among the Tarahumara. Much of the story is the background on the runners: Barefoot Ted is a character too wildly obnoxious to be a real man; Billy and Jen the surfer/runners, and Scott Carrier, the vegetarian super-runner from Seattle. Caballo attempts to bring all of these superathletes together for a 50-mile race in Tarahumara country.<br /><br />Born to Run is even more than a fascinating story of an impossible race with superheroes. As McDougall continues to find out how to run better, he offers a history of running, running shoes, and the Nike marketing machine. Along the way, he preaches on the benefits of barefoot running, and how modern running shoes actually cause us injury. You've no doubtedly have seen those silly Vibram Five Finger shoes. Those skyrocketed in popularity in response of this book. Around where I live, people wear them seemingly as a fashion statement (a poor one at that!). However, this book made an excellent case for barefoot running, and I've been looking online for a pair.<br /><br />McDougall offers us a book that defies to be labeled as one type of book. It's part biography, auto-biography, magazine reporting, science journal, sport history, and man-vs-nature story. He does all of these well.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read this book, regardless if you like running or not. Just try to leave your Five Fingers in the closet unless you are running.ave seen those silly Vibram Five Finger shoes. Those skyrocketed in popularity in response of this book.

B000Q6ZG5M|4.0|Since the novel's 1997 release, the buzz about a film adaptation of Philosopher's Stone was abounds. It wasn't until 2001 when Potterheads' dreams came true, and the book's film adaptation came out, sending fans to the cinemas in droves. Since the film's release and foretold box office success, the series has gone on to have the whole book series adapted, including the most successful adaptation, the newest one, Deathly Hallows Part 2. Since all the movies are out, I figured it would be nice to let my inner Potterhead put the nostalgia to the test.<br /><br />Let me start off by that Harry Potter has played a big part in my life. I've been a fan since 1999, when my aunt sent me the first book for Christmas. I had no idea what Harry Potter was at the time, and furthermore, the book was my first big read, so as you could imagine, opening the pages and reading the first few sentences, I was immediately hooked. Every time a book came out, I was frantic to get it. I saw every movie on their respective opening day, and own every movie on DVD, and recently rebought them on blu-ray.<br /><br />As of a recent rewatching, this movie, I will say, is a solid adaptation that, at the time, was considered the \\"Watchmen\\" of fantasy novels, in the fact that it was unfilmable. For the most part, Columbus did a solid job with the source material. However, if one thing holds the movie back, it seems as if he was trying too hard to make it perfect. I think anyone who hasn't read the book will be lost on what's happening, as a result. Dint get me wrong, this movie is indeed very good in terms of being a solid adaptation. I think, however, Columbus could have done a better job at making it a bit more cinematic.<br /><br />The acting, for a mostly kid anchored cast, is excellent. Daniel Radcliffe was a little kid back when this was going on, nobody thought he'd go on to be the little actor who stole audiences hearts worldwide. He really did a fantastic job with the role. He essentially leaped from the pages of the book, he's that good. The supporting cast do as good a job as said Radcliffe. Rupert Grint was probably the cutest member of the cast! He was just charming and quirky as the dimwitted but ever so funny Ron. Emma Watson was extremely cute as Hermione, and man, her performance is almost like she really is Hermione in real life! Let's not forget to mention Tom Felton who apparently didn't read the book, yet excelled as Draco, and Matthew Lewis as the naive but charming Neville Lonottom. Speaking of which, it's worth it to mention how he's grown up so much. I'm not gay, but seriously, LOOK AT MATTHEW LEWIS NOW. He is GORGEOUS. Honestly, I'm not gay at all, but it's so hard to believe he went from being a pudgy kid to an extremely handsome grown adult. In fact, the entire cast have grown up so much, it's unbelievable.<br /><br />In addition, the cinematography in the film is brilliant. From the films gorgeous opening shots of Privet Drive to the vibrant colour of Hogwarts, this is one of the most visually gorgeous shots ever.<br /><br />While watching the blu-ray, one word rang through the back of my head, \\"soft\\". The image quality is simply not what it could have been. Mind you, this was shot on a considerably lower budget than the rest of the lot. And this is the best looking the movie will be. Some shots looked fantastic, others looked like Sharon Osbourne did the transfer. Also, either it's just me or there was a major adjust in F-stop in the Quidditch scene. The Audio is a nice mix, though, as there is a lot of oomph in John Williams' score, as well as the sound effects simply sound more epic. The special features, though, are exactly the same as the DVD. You'd think they'd have brought some more features in for the blu-ray, but come on.<br /><br />In short, apparently at the time, in 2007 WB didn't screen this blu ray for blu ray review sites. It's not hard to see why. As for the movie, it's a good start, but there was a lot more to come.Still, a must see nonetheless.<br /><br />MOVIE: 3.5/5<br />VIDEO: 3/5<br />AUDIO: 5/5<br />EXTRAS: 2/5<br />OVERALL:4/5<br /><br />PROS: Soightly above par video and excellent audio to be found in this blu-ray release,<br /><br />CONS:  Video is not as good as it could be, plus the lack of extras is disappointing.5  VIDEO: 3/5  AUDIO: 5/5  EXTRAS: 2/5  OVERALL:4/5    PROS: Soightly above par video and excellent audio to be found in this blu-ray release,    CONS:  Video is not as good as it could be, plus the lack of extras is disappointing.

B004FGMDOQ|1.0|(3 stars for book content, 0 stars for Kindle e-version) I only marginally enjoyed this book on my my Kindle App for iPad and I think I figured out why when I got to the end of the e-book. There was a list of 20-30 picture references of which only about 10% would show. From what i understand from other reviews, the pictures greatly added to the text.

0545140323|4.0|After reading Prom and Prejudice earlier this year, I knew I'd want to check out Eulberg's debut work, hoping for another delightful funny book. I received that, including several scenes where I literally laughed out loud, earning myself some \\"you're crazy\\" looks from my sister. What to the evs!<br /><br />Penny Lane Bloom (yes her parents are Beatles fanatics...and I do mean fanatics. They became vegetarians, not for any moral reasons but because Paul McCartney is a vegetarian) has just had her heart broken by a long-time crush and has decided to swear off boys for the rest of her high-school career. They are just jerks who cause girls to change themselves and dump their friends in order to secure their approval.  Now while Penny may go a bit far in the original manifesto, she has a valid point. A lot of high school boys suck (at least in my personal experience) so why not focus on having fun with your friends and figuring out who you are during those pivotal years?  Thus she becomes the founding (and for a time sole) member of The Lonely Hearts Club, committed to staying single in high school and rocking out to the music of four guys who will never let her down.<br /><br />Needless to say, this ends up being very popular with the female students at Penny's high school who band together to support each other as one tries out for basketball while another seeks treatment for anorexia.  They focus on friendship and being there for each other. Of course it gets complicated when some of the male students are upset by the loss of their girlfriends and even the principal tries to intervene as well as when a guy who might actually be nice seems to like Penny and she returns the feelings.<br /><br />Now there weren't any real surprises in this book as it's fairly obvious who Penny's love interest will be and I felt that some of the boy characters were treated much too harshly.  Additionally because of the number of girls involved in The Lonely Hearts Club, some of them don't have much personality nor do they receive enough attention.  But I loved their burgeoning feminism and passion for the idea as well as their ability to soften some of their stances in order to give the reader a happy ending.<br /><br />Overall: A cute, funny, fast contemporary read!<br /><br />Cover: I love the feminine take on the famous Abbey Road album cover.nor do they receive enough attention.

0545259088|3.0|I started this book expecting it to be as good as the first two books Shiver and Linger. As I read on I discovered this was not the case. There wasn't a lot of action and the action that was there was too small and not dramatic enough. A hunt of the wolves? Yeah, I've heard it before. And the whole werewolfism wasn't explained. She didn't explain how the weather related to their change.  The cure they already discovered in Linger. I just wasn't satisfied. The ending was wide open and what happened between Isabel and Cole? Do they fall in love? Does Cole go back home? Do Grace and Sam live happily ever after? Who knows? This book was good, but just not great. It doesn't reach the standards she set for herself with Shiver and Linger.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I enjoyed this book most out of the three in this series.  The second book, The Girl Who Played with Fire, takes a little while to get to the heart of the mystery, but it ends with a bit of a cliff-hanger.  The third book, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest, picks up right where the second one ends, so I thought it would be action-packed - not so.  I enjoyed the first book most because I thought it was the most tightly put together and best written.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I bought this headset to replace my dying Plantronics .Audio 355. I primarily play a variety of games on my PC, though I occasionally watch movies and listen to music as well. I didn't experience any of the head-clamping others have mentioned in reviews, though they might have a larger head than I do, since I did notice that this headset is quite snug, though not to an uncomfortable degree. The build quality of this headset is very solid, and the cord is thick and seems resistant to damage.    I'm a bit disappointed with the audio quality for this headset, particularly the bass. The audio is clear with no static, but the bass response is just weak. It's heard, but not felt. I have an ASUS Xonar DG audio card and no amount of amplifying the headset or fiddling with the equalizer could bring the bass up to a similar level of my older headset. I enjoy a strong bass in my headsets, especially when I'm playing action/FPS PC games, so I think I may consider buying a different headset when it comes time for this one to be replaced. This headset also \\"leaks\\" audio quite a bit, much more than my previous headsets at least. If you're concerned about family/roommates being able to easily hear what you're listening to, this may not be the headset for you.    The microphone quality is quite good. I don't know if it's good enough for professional applications, but I do know that I come through crystal-clear in Ventrilo and Skype.
B000002KGT|5.0|It may seem kind of pointless for me to offer my two cents on such an overwhelmingly acknowledged classic as `Rumours' but here it goes. The legend of the excruciatingly emotional trauma that all five members were going through in their interpersonal relationships - Buckingham and Nicks were kaput plus the breakup of the McVies' marriage - has been related adnauseum on anything to do with the history of Fleetwood Mac or the making of this landmark LP. Again not a huge of the band especially the pop rock, mega platinum California years but I have always enjoyed listening to `Rumours'. \\"Go Your Own Way\\" and \\"Second Hand News\\" were always favorites along with \\"The Chain\\" and \\"Gold Dust Woman\\".  The other hits don't need me to comment on so I'll leave them be.  Though I do like its self-titled predecessor more, `Rumours' deserves all the praise and respect it has earned in the last thirty plus years - listen to the wind blow, watch the sun rise...
0316098329|4.0|I sometimes get tired of reading the same old, same old, and ROOM promised to be something different. It kept that promise. It is a compelling, dark, and imperfect work.    SPOILER WARNING: I can't write this review without giving away plot details, so if you haven't read the book yet, please stop reading here!    For the first 60 or so pages of the book I was afraid the book was going to fall into the same category as THE STORY OF EDGAR SAWTELLE, which I found unbearable. I found myself skimming (never a good sign), because how many times can you describe the contents of an 11 x 11 room as well as the daily routine of playing games, sleeping, and eating? I wouldn't say the narrator, the 5-year old Jack, is annoying per se - but I'm sure many of us have heard children that age telling stories that go on far too long and just aren't that interesting. In life, we listen to them to be polite (or not to offend their parents). In fiction, it's tiresome.    But the situation turned around magically when the Escape from their prison is being plotted and executed. I don't think my heart has pounded like that in any of the last 100 thrillers/suspense novels I've read. When the escape is successful, the book takes its third turn into \\"life after imprisonment,\\" with Mother and Son both having serious adjustments to the world around them. Here, too, Jack is a less-than-perfect narrator, but he's effective enough for the reader to see the point Emma Donoghue is making: how supposedly \\"normal\\" and free people who haven't been through their ordeal can be just as cruel, callous, and selfish as Jack and Ma's captor.  There's the news anchor who asks truly inhuman questions - Ma's father, who can't accept Jack because he's the result of rape - Ma's brother, sister-in-law, and child, who are the typical bickering, overstressed, self-centered family you can see everywhere you go - even most of the people at the clinic are coldly clinical, not seeing Ma and Jack as human beings but rather as subjects on whom they can write their next research paper or get their next doctorate degree.    When I first read about Ma's post-release suicide attempt, I felt angry because so little information is given regarding the reasons behind it. I'm not sure if this is a flaw with the book or if Donoghue intended us to read between the lines. I now think the latter.  Ma had been abducted, held in captivity for seven years, repeatedly raped, and had a stillborn birth. What kept her sane was knowing that she had to take care of Jack. But once she's back in the world, everything that she pushed back to make life seen normal for Jack comes flooding to the surface, and it is A LOT to deal with. Her family doesn't help matters, nor does the media. She also has the intense guilt of now wanting to have a life of her own, to not be an appendage of Jack permanently. In light of all this, the suicide attempt makes sense.    And speaking of being an appendage of Jack, I have been reading through some of these reviews and I just can't believe the number of people offended by the fact that Ma breast feeds Jack until (and after) their escape, as well as their being grossed out by the Tooth.  Folks, in case you missed your biology lessons, that's what breasts are for - nursing, not male pleasure or artificial enhancement with silicone. I know our parents' generation was somehow led to believe that breast feeding is \\"disgusting,\\" but it's time to get past that.  Not only was breast feeding a desperate mother's attempt to stay close with her child, it was also an effort to give him the nutrients and boosted immune system that everyone now knows is a result of drinking mother's milk. For the child it's equally understandable - it's a way to stay close to the mother. Not only that, Ma points out that breast feeding is a way of preventing herself from getting pregnant again by her rapist.  As for the tooth, yes it's disgusting,  but it's the boy's way of being close to his mother whenshe's not there. He doesn't have much, but he has the tooth.  And anyone who doesn't realize that 5-year-olds can engage in some disgusting behavior hasn't spent much time around 5-year-olds.    I do agree with the criticism of Jack's diction and narrative. Sometimes it felt real to me; sometimes, fake. But I think that's bound to happen in any book with a child narrator, especially one who is both precocious and developmentally disabled at the same time.  Overall, ROOM is a good book that I feel I can recommend, but it's not a perfect one, and you do have to grit your teeth to get through the first part of the book before it gets into its flow. For me, the slog through the first 70 pages was worth the ultimate payoff - and the sense, at the end, that both Ma and Jack are going to be OK.
B0043ISH6O|3.0|The opening, Hand Covers Bruise, was strikingly familiar, as was most of the soundtrack as the action unfolded. I realized later it was because Brian Eno had been doing the exact same stuff (but better) since 1978.  If you liked this album, do yourself a favor and check out his \\"Discreet Music\\", \\"Apollo\\", any of the \\"Ambient\\" series (especially \\"Ambient 4\\"), \\"The Pearl\\", and \\"Thursday Afternoon\\".  Gems all...
B0011WABIW|5.0|What can you say, that hasn't already been said about this album? And why, why? has it continued to be so revered by the public, other musicians and critics up and down and round and round?  Everything you could imagine about how good an album can be is true. At this point, the album is such a success on so many levels that now, there are almost as many detractors. shame on them. how could they?  I grew up hearing much of it on the radio, out of sync, and i still can remember how extroardinary the music was. whether played in entirety or heard as a song here and still there...you can tell that the band has made a masterwork that must be a classic.  Like the Who's Tommy or Quadrophenia, the album is a rock opera of bombastic preportions. There is so much going on at once, you wonder how the band managed to put it all together. Tommy and Quadrophenia may be longer in text, but DSTM, is in no way any less of an achivement. They made a Broadway musical of Tommy? Well, how stupid no one has taken a chance with this one?  People remember the beating at the beginning, the familiar chaotic bell chimes,the overall sonic sound, the cash register mocking, the multilayered voices, the operatic wailing (we'll get to that in a minute). However, for me, what is most remarkable, quite simply is the vocals from David Gilmour and Roger Waters, more so from Gilmour.  I'll try to only use one example from each. Listen to Gilmor's vocals on Time. There is the yin and yang, back and forth of rage and trying to control himself, then going into a meditation, to only go back again. If you point out Roger Waters, you would point out Money. It's not what he is singing, really it is HOW he sings it. It's not really a song about the ugliness of capitalism as much as it is a song about outright cynicism that has gone out of control. If you buy this for no other reason, you need to buy it for the vocal performance alone by Gilmour and Waters.  I can't recall the female vocalist who performs the standout opera solo at various points in the album, especially the side one coda, Great Gig in the Sky. But it simply is the most significant piece on the album. It is astounding that a psychadelic rock band could write a peice of music and then have the audacity to hire a black singer to deliver the song, put it on a rock album and make it the standout track. To hear it is to be changed forever by it. And the singer should have been lauded to the hills for her performance and should have been offered every kind of album deal they shelled out in 1974.  Like all classics, it is pretty much impossible to tire of the album. Pink Floyd made a genius piece of rock opera that will continue to only grow and prosper for years to come.
B000002G8J|5.0|Unfortunately, this album is underrated, however it´s one of the best albuns of erics´carer.I don´t understand why many claptons fans tkink that a mediocre albun like  SLOWHAND is better than this ......  Backless is amazing......good rock songs, great covers of two dylan´s songs and the fantastics tell me that you love me and promises......  Surely, one of the five better albuns of Mr Clapton!
B0055SWM08|4.0|Beautiful graphics, smooth gameplay So far so good.  Several levels.  No difficulty with forced interaction with fb and twitter unlike some games.
B004UHF51S|4.0|As always Michael has produced another jewel of an albunm.  You can close your eyes and almost be there with him. I especially like tracks # 3 and 8 , Summer in New York and Samba Blue. The track Time Together is sad because I know it was written for Flora . I can sympathize with him as we had to do the same just recently.    Just one of your greatest fans
0312370849|4.0|Tatiana de Rosnay's Sarah's Key features the intertwining story lines of the young pre-adolescent Sarah Starzynski living in Paris in 1942 and the contemporary, middle-aged American Julia Jaramond, living in Paris early this decade. Secrets undermine the lives of both characters throughout the novel. Julia becomes obsessed with the story of this young girl, who along with her parents, was arrested and held with thousands of other Parisian Jews during World War II at the Velodrome d'Hiver, a bicycling arena. This Vel' d' Hiv' deportation and subsequent slaughter of  over 13,000 French Jewish people -- over 4,000 of them children -- is not well known, so Ms. de Rosnay performs a great service bringing this lesser known history of the Holocaust to readers worldwide through Sarah's compelling story, and I thank her for that.     I especially enjoy learning about history within the structure of a good plot and well rounded characters, so in that regard, the story line of Sarah Starzynski  is educative while evoking a compassionate response. Julia's contemporary issues are those I think modern women can relate to; for example, many readers can empathize with the loneliness and alienation a dishonest spouse or a disarming pretense can invoke. I do agree with previous reviewers that Julia's story, told in choppy chapters at the end of the book, seems rushed and underdeveloped, weakening her storyline at the conclusion. The other critique I offer is that the language and writing style in the book are somewhat dull -- I would have enjoyed more rich imagery (a natural for the locations and human interactions in the novel) and a greater variety of words in general. Still, the book is worth reading, and like many reviewers here, it riveted my interest to the degree that I read it in two days!

B004WJREPO|4.0|McCartney II album its probably the one i hear less 'cause its the one i love less. Surprisingly when i bought the Deluxe edition I expect much more than the first time i hear it, and YES!! it was better than the first time!!! The 2d Cd tracks are great, specialy Blue Sway in its orchestrated version sound very fresh to me, and knowing that this track was originaly planned for the COLD CUTS album leaves me wondering how the other track could sound!!!<br />The 3d CD has the original mix versions for most of the album tracks, but HEY!!! some of them are better than the versions of the original LP, as example the few minutes more in the Coming Up Full Lengh version make the song less flat than the one in the main album, of course i love the original but this sound more rich in the arrengments and the live version remains me why i love the sound of the bass guitar!!! Paul just move his fingers like a fish on the water!!!<br />I rediscover this album for better and i hope the next Deluxe albums leave me with more of this feeling!!!<br />The only tracks that are really boring for me are Secret Friend (to long and flat) and, opposite to the things some say, Waterfalls (to slow, maybe wth another arrengments could have sound better)<br />This album it not easy to listen. Some consider it the worst MACCA album, some other say that is very underreted. I just say that is funny and very experiental, and maybe if this album never happenned we couldn't enjoy the greatness of the FIREMAN never. Certainly this its not a commercial album, it's more an historical understanding of Paul's way of doing music; or, someone has forgotten that \\"SCRAMBLED EGGS\\" beggin as a joke with absurd words and it turns into the most covered song in the world??
0061537969|5.0|It's amazing how the author was able to get inside the dog's mind and tell the story from his perspective!  Garth Stein has the right mixture of humor, pathos and wisdom to create an amazing narrative. The story is interesting and is a quick read. If you can read this book without ending in tears, you are in a distinct minority.

B00517VL2S|5.0|I have all 3 seasons. Season 3 ending has a great cliff hanger.<br />how will this effect Castle's writing? will he include it in Nikki Heat? and be reminded of what happened forever? How will this effect his relationship, with his family, coworkers and Beckett?<br />How will this effect Beckett, will she bounce back with determination? will she be gun shy? will she pull away from Castle? will she consider leaving the Police force?<br />How will this effect everyone in Hommicide?<br /><br />I can't wait for season 4
0882709194|1.0|I am a firm believer in letting all viewpoints be heard so I read every stinking page of the absolutely nonsensical, poorly researched, judgmental and biased introduction even though I could tell by the third page that it would make my eyes bleed. But I finished it so I can honestly say that Ray Comfort seriously needs to take a class in basic biology and scientific reasoning(the questions asked on page 27 are easily answered by a basic introductory course to biology). It is this complete obliviousness to modern science and his poor writing style that ultimately doomed this book in my eyes but if you like your science to ignore evidence and support some of the more fundamentalist worldviews, you might get something from this introduction. The actual Origin of Species by Charles Darwin is as usual an excellent read.

B004OZOTSQ|4.0|I'm not sure how to have picked from the various wifi apps.  It was pretty easy on webOS =)  But I got this through Amazon's deal of the day.  I was skeptical as it works though your web browser, but it sure beats having to run a server service on my comp.  I can access it from any computer in my home.. or a friends home.    Works as advertised, easy to grab a file you need or to drop one on your phone.  The only downside is you can't upload a folder (say, a root folder of organized music).  But you CAN upload a zip file, and unzip it on your phone through the web interface.  Neat.    The only other issue keeping from 5 stars is occasional lock ups when I exit the app.  EVO 3D here, go launcher ex.
1594744769|4.0|We get it. You're jonesing. Bad. The Boy Who Lived is all grown up. Harry Potter has kids. And sideburns. Panem has been overthrown, the Hunger Games abolished, and you're still peeved that Jennifer Lawrence has been cast to play Katniss in the upcoming film. So what's a self-respecting adult fan of YA fantasy lit to do? Have no fear, kiddos: Ransom Riggs has your fix in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children.<br /><br />\\"Peculiar\\" is the operative titular word here, describing not only the tone of the book--a captivating blend of magical mystery, realism and creeping menace reminiscent of the Harry Potter series--but also the transformation of the main character, Jacob, from routine teenage outcast to young man determined to pursue his unique destiny. Jacob's journey begins with the tragic death of his grandfather, Abe, whose tall tales of monster hunting and children with strange powers entertained Jacob as a child. Unable to cope with the loss of his grandfather, and encouraged by his therapist, Jacob travels to the isolated Welsh island that served as the setting for Abe's stories. What Jacob finds there, of course, is more peculiar than either he or the reader had imagined.<br /><br />Riggs' knack for storytelling is obvious from the first pages of the book, which draw readers in with promises of the weird adventures to come. The characters you'll encounter in Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children are immediately recognizable; you may not always like them, but you don't always like everyone in real life, either. And that's what makes Riggs' skill at characterization so apparent: His ability to portray as whole (that is to say, complex and, thus, not always pleasant) personalities with minimum detail, a talent Riggs uses to establish, setting, too. It's that rare skill of achieving complexity through simplicity that makes Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children such a compelling book to read.<br /><br />Any review of Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children would be incomplete if it didn't comment on the book's design. Bonus points to Riggs and Quirk, the publisher, for bucking the digital trend and creating a beautifully designed print book. Sure, the cover, featuring a black-and-white photo of a levitating girl, is creepy. But it's the use of vintage photographs--collected by the author and his friends--as storytelling devices inside the book that really make the \\"book-as-thing\\" special. Peculiar in this age of e-readers, indeed.<br /><br />So there you have it, readers: The perfect book to get you through those cold shakes you've been having since you saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II for the third time. Have I mentioned that the movie rights to Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children have already been optioned? And that a sequel is in the works? Better just give it a try. It'll make you feel good.<br /><br />Review originally posted at[...]n would be incomplete if it didn't comment on the book's design.

1250004349|1.0|I was really interested in this book, because it involved WWII and the Jews of France.  The subject is something that I think people have not addressed properly and in some ways, it has been swept under the carpet.  My expectations were high.  Unfortunately, the author is not very good.  The characters were contrived and unbelievable.  The writing was simply amateur.  It reminded me of a Lifetime made-for-tv movie.  I wish a decent author had written on this subject.  Too bad!
B00461AIXI|4.0|I didn't think Bruno's album was going to be all that. But ever since I made a \\"Grenade\\" station on Pandora, I was introduced to most of his album. And I gotta say, I'm surprised that I like it so much. If you like Colbie Caillat's music, I think you'd also find this enjoyable. Only flaw I found is that he sounds the same in all his songs; by that I mean he's screaming in all his tracks. But other than that, his music is versatile.
1594744769|4.0|i enjoyed reading this book. the children are all unique right down to their personality's...lol. I like jacob's(the grandson & main chracter) serch for the truth regarding his grandfather with loom's off suspstion from his father and aunt about were he would go on \\"hunting trips\\"...there were part's were i was thrown back like when the children reveal their ages and to know emma is 88 yrs old and jacob is 16 and they like each other is weird though. she still remain's ageless (untill they stay's out of the loop too long and it will age them to their real age and they die)...i enjoyed looking at the phictures give faces to the charecters...overall good book..

B001I1SFQQ|2.0|A fantastic band and a truly classic album but I had to return this item due to the quality of the vinyl LP pressing. Not only was there a large scratch on the first track that made it unplayable but there was a vicious level of surface hiss on the rest of the album.

030788743X|4.0|I tore through this book pretty fast, couldn't put it down for a couple days (except when my kids made me).  The story has been summarized by many other reviewers, so won't get into that in detail.  But basically has a nice quest structure, pulls you along as the main character moves through an array of challenges in a pretty cool virtual game.  The 80's nostalgia is basically non-stop, and I'd say that anyone of even passing geekiness who was born in the early 70's will find it a pretty awesome nostalgia trip.    That being said, the writing is admittedly pretty leaden.  I don't think Ian McEwan is going to be sweating Ernest Cline anytime soon.  The occasional attempts at social commentary are also pretty ham-handed.  Fortunately they are not overbearing after the story's initial setup.    So take Ready Player One for what it is-- a cool story and a fun test of your 80's geek trivia.  I'd recommend it despite some flaws.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|As someone before has stated, there are several technical glitches throughout the book, for example in the signature of the letter of the first story, in the word \\"employee\\" as well as in place of (money) values in the second story.. (and that is as far as I have gotten so far). It is highly annoying. I am merely reading the kindle version as a means to pass the time while I wait for a different, annotated version in print to come from the library; I also have another electronic version I can consult every time I come across a glitch of unintelligible symbols (I hate not knowing what they intend to say).    The stories themselves are much shorter than the novels (well duh). I had begun the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes after first reading the annotated versions of a Study in Scarlet then the Sign of Four and find the annotations to be quite helpful at times (albeit excessive at others) - for example, translations are provided for the non-English phrases that Mr. Sherlock Holmes uses.    I absolutely adore the sherlock holmes series <3 and would recommend reading an annotated version if it's your first time with this series - or even if it isnt your first time!

I thought it was just amazing ya know. So i go to goodwill and see the hardcover edition for four bucks i quickly buy it. When I get home  i start reading.....<br /><br />WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD<br />(actually im not entirely sure wat that means but i think it means giving away some parts of the book)<br /><br />Well Edward in twilight was a strong vampire. Strong enough to kiss a human anyway. In new moon he falls away from bella. Eclipse i was impressed. Edward was the strongest he had ever been and was willing to fight for bella. That is a good boyfriend in my opinion. Breaking Dawn,hmmmmm lets see hes a ghost of a man and just walks away from bella when she asks to hold his hand. If youre going to have a ghost of a man,at least use that space to add some suspense to the story,like burning his hand off or something. That i would have enjoyed. But noooooooo. He cries and cries and whines and whines,and then he talks to jacob about it. As i reread this scene,I jumped in suprise. They wanted to abort bellas baby! Its killing her. She should know that,but she loves it, and if that is a sacrifice shes willing to make,then let her. There is absolutley no reason for that,and I was dissapointed  that jacob actually agreed to ask bella. And so calmly to. I mean i wanted to have jacob get in a fight with edward and win. But that would just break bellas heart wouldnt it? So is telling her that her husband wants to kill her baby! As Bella gets better edward grows stronger and then drops low again as bella Â«Vomited a fountain of blood. Horrible Horrible Horrible

1439148813|5.0|The book was kind of dry, but that was to be expected.  What struck me was every time NASA sent a rocket hurling into space it was a whole new experience with a whole new set of challenges.  To think most of the calculations were done by hand, because the computers couldn't do what a drafting calculator can do today.  I have a whole new respect for what the workers in launch control, who were responsible for getting the rockets up and the humans in them back to earth safely, went through.  They really are the heroes of the NASA program.  As a nation, we took JFK's dream to put a man on the moon and made it happen.  It was a time of drastic challenges, politically, socially and technology was changing our world at a whirlwind pace.  This book makes you proud to be an American.
B000003TSP|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. It's not the kind of music you can just play casually for anyone. The listener must be open-minded. The setting must be right as well. This isn't driving music or dance music. It's almost performance art. My family spent a couple of years in Europe during the 60s. This album takes me there. It reminds me of going to the movies to see James Bond and Alphaville with Lemmy Caution. I get a whole European black-and-white vibe from this album. It's dark and exciting. I love Beth Gibbons' voice, especially when it sounds like it's about to break. The intensity is overwhelming. Sit back, relax, be quiet, and listen.

0449000729|5.0|All right, I admit it - I am an unrepentant Anglophile. However even without my love of all things British, this is a fabulous book. I've read it several times and look forward to one day obtaining the audio version (about the only way I 'read' anymore). This book has a charm I've rarely found in a book, and re-reading it is like visiting an old friend. There are scenes and lines that I have looked forward to on each subsequent reading.<br />I really love the concept of writing about a place and advancing each chapter forward in history as Rutherfurd has done here, and the notion that in places like this that have had human habitation since pre-historic times there could be people alive there today that are descendants of the earliest inhabitants. Some time after first reading this book I read a news article saying that somewhere in Britain an ancient grave was found and the dna extracted from the remains was found to match that of a man living in the village nearby. Amazing stuff...<br />If you enjoy history, especially British history, you will probably enjoy this book.
B002ZG994U|1.0|The A-Team was one of my favorite TV shows.  The movie, IMO, is a total disaster.  The story is silly, the acting awful and the production horrible.  The only reason I finished watching it was to write this review and not base it on half the movie.  The TV show was fun and even charming.  The movie is tiresome and outrageous.  I expect to get some nasty replies to my review.  I invite you to say whatever you want.  However, the movie stunk.
B004EQAVHI|5.0|I'm always a little leery when a movie is made of a book I've read. It's a difficult job to condense a novel into one and a half hours, but this was an excellent movie! While many of Kathy H's personal thoughts are removed, the movie added a richness to the story with \\"authentic\\" settings. A very believable alternate reality; and from what I know of human nature, sadly all too possible.
0553801473|4.0|I discovered GRRM a little over a year and a half ago, devouring A Game of Thrones through A Feast for Crows.  What I enjoyed most about GRRM's writing was the uncertainty factor (and the gray factor where no one is entirely good nor evil) in some characters . . . the storyline, the gradual and multi-faceted fleshing out, then, bamm, they're dead, or a character that I despised I now could sympathize with and understand a little more about where they were coming from all along.  A staple in the books thus far is the depth of character development invested in all the peoples wandering across the realms amid the sprawling storyline.<br />So after reading the first ones I then had to wait for A Dance With Dragons.  I didn't have to wait nearly as long as many readers but I awaited, hoped, and at times anxiously perused GRRM's website for development news.<br />Then, finally, it was released and I've finished it but I'm feeling a little disapointed.<br />Backstep to A Feast for Crows which I felt was a break I in the narrative where we encountered more about Cersei, The Kingslayer & a few other characters that hadn't been focused on.  Which all in all was good and certainly expands on formative material and motives but I missed Tyrion and some of my other 'peeps'.  But I must confess, however, that I'm beginning to tire a little with the relentless drama of little people with big egos stomping all over the world and trying to lay claim to what remains.<br />Oh, but that sounds like real life, whoops! I digress . . . .<br />Back to GRRM and A Dance with Dragons.  I can't help but wonder when The Others will begin to cast their shadow and make their presence known.  Winter is Coming, yes.  Or so I've heard.  The first chapter of the entire series focused on them yet we have so little involving them ever since. . . The Game of Thrones has eclipsed, perhaps, the greater power and threat in the lands.  I can't help but wonder whether GRRM has, in his desire to flesh out a world with characters both big and small, wandered off into the woods and is striving to find his way back to the path leading out; I hope the momentum is reinvigorated and we as readers are allowed to observe his characters to wrestle with the true threat, The Others, an unknown force, barely glimpsed, whose motives and intentions remain an enigma.<br />I look forward to reading the upcoming books of the series and mean no offense in my criticism.  A great vision and staggering plot which I'm grateful to have encountered.  In actuality, his depth is an inspiration to me in a market where so much is blase' and just plain fizzles.  In A Dance With Dragons I just found myself wondering, wandering and growing bored with the petty, vainglorious squabbles of little kings and queens in the Greater Scheme of Things.
B00004S367|4.0|As usual, with Amazon, it was delivered quickly and was well packaged.  What can I say? I am old school. I still listen to CDs.  The sound quality is better then most compressed music (MP3, WMA,) etc.  Unfortunately I did not look through my collection well enough before I bought this, because I already had it!  So I'll be giving this one away.  Anyway, classic Stevie Wonder. Great music.  My personal favorite is track 2.

B001HN6EF4|4.0|The item is water resistant and we have used it at the beach and pool several times without major issues.     I will say that the cards tend to stick together when wet.  This makes it difficult to shuffle and deal and you need to really take time to pull the cards apart and make sure everyone has the right number.     I like the ring feature, eps. b/c I have two small kids (2 and 5) who love open packs of cards and walk off with the cards when I am not watching.  This prevents that--yah!    On drawback, is that after using the cards about two times a few started to show signs of wear and the color/number rubbed off a little.  But, its not the end of the world and the cards are still usable.      All and all, they have worked out for us.

B000003TA4|5.0|Well like most people I have heard their singles on the radio several times but never took the time to listen to the whole album until recently. I have been going through different lists of the greatest albums of the 90s and this was on top of a few of them so I figured I would listen. I hadn't listen to the songs for a while and I was blown away by how great they sounded and how Cobain's vocals really stood out. The same time I was listening I was reading up on Kurt Cobain on Wikipedia from his beginning to the in-depth article on his death which was really moving while listening to the album. My favorite songs are lithium and drain you which I listened to 10 times each within 24 hours of finishing the album. The only songs I didn't enjoy much were Polly and Stay Away which I thought was somewhat annoying. I would also like to note that while listening to other rock albums I usually pause in the middle and get a listen of drain you in because of how great it is. Highly recommend this and I am a guy who listens to mainly hip-hop.<br /><br />Top 5 Songs<br />Drain you, In Bloom, Lithium, Smells like teen spirit, Come as you are
140053271X|1.0|Bought one of these at Wal-Mart.  I had a 15 day return period.  13 days into it with only one book read, the bottom half of the screen went black and unresponsive.  So I took it back, bought anohter one of the same.  Two days into it, it started acting glitchy.  I love the style and concept of the Nook as well as the size and feel, but seriously, they need to fix it so you can read more than one book on it before it goes out!
B0051MKMNC|5.0|Brilliant in every way.  Bradley Cooper is a very dynamic actor that pushes his limits in this film and comes up flawless.  A sequel would not be a mistake.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|The only reason I am giving this four out of five stars is because it was so disturbing that I almost put it down and said forget about finishing it. It was very hard to read which has nothing to do with her ability to write. I LOVED her style of writing. However, I thought she kind of sped up the end in order to just be done with it which left me still with some unanswered questions. Overall good book that I would recommend, but I definitely think there was more hype about it than what it lives up to.

B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|I can't see how anyone can rate this movie less than a five.  The story is brilliant. It has every element that you could possibly ask for in a movie. It's even complete with an unexpected twist. This is truly a movie that I can watch over and over and enjoy it each time. If you have less than average intelligence, it might be beyond your comprehension level.  Oherwise, buy it, you'll like it.
B002ZG99TA|3.0|The movie is based upon an actual event that happened in 2001. It is very entertaining, but it is (unfortunately) a gross distortion of the facts. The true story can be found by making a Google search of CSX 8888 (the real train).    The facts show that the CSX staff performed an amazing feat by stopping this train without any death or serious injuries. A movie based upon the truth would be very interesting. It would be something similar to the movie about Apollo 13.    The movie titled \\"The Bridge on the River Kwai\\" was also entertaining and also a gross distortion of the facts. The internet helps us to become better informed. In the future we should be able to find \\"real life\\" as entertaining as fiction.
B0032UYFA6|1.0|Warning to anyone like my self with a serious hearing problem (or if you're full-on deaf): season three has NO English subtitles/closed captioning.

0439813786|5.0|This book is amazing--deserving of the Caldecott Award! The book contains nearly 300 full-page illustrations that make you feel as if you are being pulled into a film's magic. This is also in part what the book is about--the magic and history of films, which the author has brilliantly illustrated to the reader by making the reading even more of an interactive experience than reading a book usually is. Brilliant creator, using at least as many pictures as words to truly \\"illustrate\\" the story. The illustrations are gorgeous black and white images. It appeals to artists, readers of all ages, art students and aspiring illustrators and belongs in the book/art collections of any of these folks.    The story is of a little boy who lives in a train station in France. Having suffered major losses, he is all alone in his world, sleeping in a secret apartment hidden deep inside the station, and secretly keeps the station's clocks running accurately from behind the scenes. He works slowly to repair his secret discovery hidden carefully behind the wall of his sleeping room and comes across several people who seem to be out to get him. There are many mysteries, much magic, beauty and surprises to discover along with the delight of turning the pages to find the wondrous gifts of art sprinkled liberally throughout the book.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|There are many long winded accounts and summaries of the plot on here already, so I shall be more to the point. This story evokes human emotion nearly immediately as you wander through time both present and past. A wonderful \\"fairytale\\" for adults that breaks the mold and colors outside the lines of our own reality. A novel fit for any one who transitioned awkwardly from teen to adult or wished their world to be more extraordinary. Things are not always as the seem, yet perhaps seeing truly is what leads us to believe. This story will leave you wanting more, and the haunting pictures will leave you day dreaming of side shows and days gone by. This novel is an easy read, that rockets you into the past, and worlds unimagined. However buyer beware, because you will find it hard to put down this fantastical page turner.

B00026WUBE|4.0|Just about every musical icon of the 60's went through more than one transitional period. Since Bob himself went through several of these a year during his 60's prime it was to be expected he'd spend the 70's in a near constant state of growth,tripping over his own musical feet all the time and having to get up again and again. After spending early 70's somewhat between labels he landed at Asylum records for this,his lone album there (which is currently distributed by Columbia) and bought The Band back along with them. They'd been recording independent of each other since the end of the 60's and now the time had come for them to reunite. Interesting part was that polished production values had taken the place of the Band's rootsy Americana style by this time. A lot of the singer-songwriters of the era were more inspired by ornate songwriting styles,even if the flavor was rootsy. In every respect this album is very much rootsy on all levels. It's somewhat out of place by mid 70's singer-songwriter standards but it's more important to Bob's career than one might think.<br /><br />  One important thing is that almost on every level this album functions as the immediate predecessor to [[ASIN:B00026WU7I Blood on the Tracks]] and [[ASIN:B00026WU50 Desire]]. The main thing is though while those two albums explore a breakup and it's aftermath this explores the process that comes with that. And it does so in very plain spoken,often non poetic terms as well. There's a lyric in the song \\"Dirge\\",an excellent if somewhat dour piece where Bob says \\"There are those who worship lonliness/I'm not one of them\\". That's basically the theme lyrically for the entire album. The albums most famous number is probably \\"Forever Young\\",which Bob apparently felt so strongly about he presented it in two versions here-first a folky ballad and an uptempo version. Personally I prefer the latter since it's bluesy-rock flavor gives it a funkier style overall. It's almost the anthem for age obsessed baby boomers whom Bob influenced with his 60's music. Even though the album is pretty uniformly rootsy folky rock in flavor the harder edged songs \\"Tough Mama\\" and \\"You Angel You\\" add some energy and a growl to Bob's vocal style somewhat different than his usual nasal delivery.<br /><br />  While just one or two songs short of being one of Bob's classics,and even those are very good songs this goes along with pretty much of all his pre-[[ASIN:B00026WU7I Blood on the Tracks]] 70's releases. Being that he spent most of the album building his music in several different possible variants of a certain sound-to see which one would best fit his game plan. As it turned out,by blending these different ends of the same construct together into what became Bob Dylan's most successful sound of the decade. While it was clear that the type of country/folk/rock elements that had proven so fruitful for him since the late 60's was starting to lose some steam at this point,this album both looked to the future while providing a little final gasp of another age. Most singer-songwriters were by this point embracing various pop,R&B and jazz flavors into their world during this time. Since Bob was struggling not only with his marriage but also with his parallel needs to be both a futurist and a roots musician all at the same time,this meant a create creative payoff for him on this album. When his musical wasn't 100% successful,he was still able to grab people's attention with his music. And a positive musical future was yet to come.It's almost the anthem for age obsessed baby boomers whom Bob influenced with his 60's music.

B003XQRZ7E|2.0|Finally got around to listening to the samples of this album after seeing it recommended on That Metal Show for a second time today. I still like That Metal Show, but I'm becoming more and more disenchanted with their \\"Picks of the Week\\". Maybe they're sincere, or maybe they're trying to help out their buddies, or well, we all know how corrupt the music industry is... Having said that, this one comes closer to hitting the target (but not the bullseye) than some of their other picks.   Listening to the samples of Black Country Communion, it makes me feel like I'm test driving a classic Ferrari that's not firing on all cylinders. If someone would just get in there and massage the inner workings, man this thing could be awesome! As it is, I'll have to pass it by. It's got all the right components under the hood, it just needs more work. Another reviewer said it was all done in four days, and that's not hard to believe.

B002U0KHMY|5.0|I think season 3 has been uneven, with the team dealing with cases that are clearly not white collar (black widows, protecting a threatened journalist) but still the series remains an excellent one.

0060936223|2.0|I love Patti Smith's music, but this book had none of the spirit and joy of her work. While the writing is generally light on its feet and Robert Mapplethorpe comes off as rather sweet and gentle, Patti Smith can't even brush her teeth  without evoking the name of a painter, poet, sculptor,rock star etc. It's exhausting. We never know WHY she loves Rimbaud, or HOW Genet influenced her. After a while it's a tedious, pretentious list.     Art should be connected to the world, to the human condition, not just to art itself. It becomes suffocating. After a while, I yearned to pick up a book of insurance law, anything to be rescued from this insular world of creativity.     I love and admire many of the artists she mentions, and realize youth is full of a thousand passions and pretensions, inspirations, but this was way too much.      Their friendship was very moving, esp. toward the end of Mapplethorpe's life, but I don't understand the euphoric response to this book.
B004Y1USV2|3.0|When Yes comes out with a new album, as a YES fan there are serveral lines of division. Yes without Jon Anderson, Yes without Rick Wakeman? How does the guitar sound? Is Bill Buford better the Allan White? What about the album cover-is it designed by Roger Dean? How is the overall sound? Whats the message? Any one of these threads and I could write for days.         First of all, a great cover by Roger Dean, (if you look closely, it even has the two cats from Drama on it!. Now, I am a big Jon Anderson fan, and the new singer is no Jon Anderson. However, if you take the album as face value, he is closer to Trevor Horn.  Vocals are good. My only complaint. Hearing the music, I can only imagine what Jon Anderson sounded. It would have made it a better album. However, it is still very good. The alubm is closer to Drama, then classic yes. It is well produced, the sound is very clear. Steve Howe has a great short acoustic number. What impressed me the most about the album was the backing vocals. THe guys harmonize very well. Over all a good album, great story, looking forward to seeing where this new YES is going. I would say it is worth the investment.

0553801473|3.0|A Dance with Dragons attempts to burn off the rest of the story from A Feast for Crows, and push the events forward to bring it in line with what shall occur in the upcoming The Winds of Winter. Amidst a lot of dross and unnecessarily forced story points concerning the Watch, Stannis, Tyrion and the Martells, is a fascinating exploration of the most special relationships, people and their pets/children. By far, my favorite segments involve Daenaerys and the Dragons. Although there's more to love those are the stand out sections, as is Arya and the intimate space of Jon Snow and his pet dire wolf. Better than Feast for Crows, but hoping the next volume is straightforward story.
B004HO6I4W|3.0|Rio seemed to stay in theaters longer than any non-Pixar animated movie in recent memory. I was actually surprised each week when I'd check the weekly box office scores and see Rio still in the top 5, week after week. The movie must've done something right, right? Well, I think the main reason it stuck around so long was because it was pretty much the only family movie out at the time. I recently finished the movie, and while it took me 5 sittings to get through the whole thing, I'll be honest and say that while I definitely didn't like it, it's still better than some other recent family movies (Hop, I'm lookin' at you). Rio just doesn't have much going for it aside from a colorful cast of characters and most of the focus being on the birds. A lot of the jokes fall flat, there's not much danger from the villains, and most of the actors chosen to do the voices shouldn't have been anywhere near this movie. But hey, at least George Lopez isn't doing his usual 'ayyyyy! I'm Mexican, we all talk like-a deeeeees! Low Riders!' here.    The movie starts out with a baby blue macaw waking up in the rain forest of Rio de Janeiro as hundreds of birds dance and sing happily. Within minutes, they're caught by poachers and shipped off to who knows where, but the little macaw's crate falls off the truck in the middle of Minnesota of all places. A little girl named Linda saves him, and raises him as her own pet, naming him Blue. Blue never learns how to fly, but doesn't need to since he's efficient at walking and climbing, so he's set. Years pass and Linda's in her late teens or early 20s, when a man from Brazil shows up to her book store and wants to take Linda and Blue with him, where Blue will be paired up with the only other surviving blue macaw, where they'll save their species. Linda agrees, but once they make it back to Rio, where Carnival is starting, Blue is once again taken by poachers, but this time he's chained to the other macaw, Jewel. She doesn't think highly of him, calling him a pet and irritated by the fact that he can't fly, but they'll have to work together if they're going to escape from the poachers, and especially if they're going to be mates.    Yes it's another fish out of water story, and it's another predictable one at that. The cast of characters is as generic as you get: dweeb hero, headstrong girl he's in love with, a knowledgeable sidekick, two goofy buddies, a trio of stooges for the secondary bad guys, and the main bad guy (another bird) with an accent. I didn't care about any of these characters, apart from Jewel, and that's because she's a no-nonsense character that I could at least agree with on how she handled some things. The others were just kinda...there. It didn't help that the voice actors barely put any effort into their lines, especially Jemaine Clement as Nigel, the evil bird. Even during his song, Jemaine sounds bored. It made me wonder why more actors didn't take a lesson from Jeremy Irons when he sang Scar's 'Be Prepared' in The Lion King. The other voice actors, including Tracy Morgan and will.i.am (ugh) play such stereotypes that it was borderline offensive. It seemed like will.i.am was just brought into the movie so he could show off a few sound effects he could do vocally, act 'street' and that was it. and Leslie Mann as a young girl? I don't even need to comment on that one. Enough with the voices though, as much as it bothered me, because the other main problem is that things are just so light. The problems the heroes get into are resolved in no time, and like I said, the villains don't pose much of a threat. Jewel's never intimidated by Nigel, who towers over her, and has no problem making the first move. If anything, Nigel's just a jerk, nothing more.  At the same time, and I know I'm contradicting myself here, I'm kind of glad it took the light route and didn't take things too seriously, because they could've easily done that here. The poaching bit was just begging for some kind of forcedmessage, and they didn't do it.    Were there things I liked about this movie? Sure. The animation and art direction was beautiful, and while it's not on Pixar or Dreamworks' finest level (How to Train Your Dragon and the Kung Fu Panda movies), the scenes with animals and flying around are a sight to behold. As flat as a lot of the jokes were, there was one that made me laugh out loud a little bit involving a crotch shot where the victim spits out two jewels. Anne Hathaway also did good with what she had to work with, though that's just a sign of a good actress, and she's done voice acting before in The Cat Returns and Hoodwinked. Kids 8 and under will probably be the best audience for Rio, but anyone older won't get much out of it.    The blu-ray looks and sounds perfect, that's all there is to it. I don't have any complaints at all with either area, and this is definitely something to show off your new tv with if you want to use an animated film as a demo. You can really see the tiniest details in the trees during the rain forest sequences, and the sound is all over the place during the more hectic bits. The special features are ok, with most of them focusing on music, dance, and the voice actors. I've actually always liked seeing footage of the actors recording their lines, so this was a treat to see. It was also nice that they included Angry Birds Rio, my personal favorite of the Angry Birds games, as it feels more polished than the others, and features characters and levels from the movie. The game was already cheap enough, but getting it for free is cool for people who haven't went for it yet.    Had there been better acting, at least to match the facial expressions of the characters, I would've been a little more into the movie. I have to stress that as much as there was that I didn't like about the movie, it's still not bad and there are worse animated movies from the last couple of years that you could pick over this. Rio is a beautiful but flawed movie. Rent it and then decide if you want to spend the money on it.

B003Y5H5FG|5.0|Let me start out by saying that I was a huge fan of the original, great, entertaining Fright Night. So, when I heard this was being made I was pumped. This is a great film and one to catch in 3D. Colin Farrel goes a fantastic job as Jerry Dandridge and the rest of the cast was great as well. I think this is one not to miss 5/5.
0670022411|5.0|In a magazine I subscribed to gave this book a good review. I ordered it from Amazon. com but when it arrived I was other wise distracted with another book. I didn't get the chance to read it until the end of summer, a month or so since it arrived. Don't make the same mistake I did by waiting to read it. I have already read the book twice since I opened the first page. My only problem now is having to wait for the second one to come out in 2012. Now if I could only get the second books release date I might just make it. Read it, you will only be disappointed if you wait.
B000X9G6AQ|5.0|Honestly I bought this on a whim because I heard Self Deception on Guitar Hero and I loved it... However I have come to realize that that was actually one of the more average songs on this album. My personal favorite is Unspoken, but I like almost everything on this album (Aeon threw me for a loop because I thought my computer was crashing, and I still can't get used to it). Listen to the samples before you buy, but I don't think you'll be disappointed.

B0042EJD8A|4.0|You've probably seen all the America's Natural Gas Alliance (ANGA) commercials of late, cheerfully consoling us that safe, clean, natural gas can be easily extracted from the ground while happy people live above, leading clean and healthier lives. The Oscar nominated GASLAND exposes the corporate lie of Natural Gas mining. From the start, where filmmaker Josh Fox receives a letter offering him something near $100,000 for the rights to drill gas from his mountain and creekside home in upstate Pennsylvania, to the end, where you watch New York City and State lawmakers fight to keep the watershed that provides millions of people from polluted drinking water, Fox explores how the Power Companies have managed to manipulate the system with the help of corrupt and gullible politicians the outright greed of the Bush/Cheney administration.<br /><br />The central point of GASLAND is that, in 2005, the EPA made changes in environmental policy that are called \\"The Halliburton Loophole.\\" That rule, snuck through by Cheney and his secretive energy board buddies (including then CEO of Enron, Ken Lay), exempted the Halliburton developed technology of hydraulic fracturing (now widely known as 'fracking') from regulations of the old Clean Water Act. The end result? Drilling for natural gas and the unbelievable amount of water and chemicals pumped into the ground required to create a well are all but completely exempt from regulations regarding the toxins that are needed to extract the gas.<br /><br />Of course, all the companies involved say that they have nothing to do with hundreds of drinking wells across the country suddenly turning unsafe withing weeks of fracking. Or animals getting sick and losing their hair. Or the methane explosions of people's homes. Or the mass die-offs of animals and fish when chemicals leak into a stream. But Fox, who tried to contact companies and individuals in mining throughout the course of his investigation gets the same treatment as the folks in states across the country; either \\"no comment\\" or massive run-arounds. When a State Environmental Agency head in Pennsylvania tells Fox that he'd help Fox and other PA citizens of Dimok (the first town Fox visits), only to note when the meeting ends that the state slashed the office's budget and basically dismantled it.<br /><br />But more revealing than anything else in the movie is the notorious flaming sink footage. When fracking shatters the aquifer of a peace of land, the gases seep into the water table. The chemicals used to pump the gas out also get into the water, and before you know it, you have flammable tapwater. It's not just that water that is getting mixed up, the air outside the well is loading up with toxins to the point where a rural area of Colorado where the population is approximately one person per square mile is as dangerous or more so than a bad day in Los Angeles. GASLAND serves as a warning and reminder; the same smiling advertisers trying to convince you that clean, accessible natural gas is not threat to you at all are the same folks that told you off-shore drilling was both safe and existing regulations guaranteed that even if the miniscule chance accident were to ever take place, they could stop it from becoming disastrous.<br /><br />When you watch GASLAND, there will probably be a detractor ready to tell you that the film is just lefty propaganda. Just remember the last sentence of the previous paragraph, and make sure to remind your companion of two little words.

B005CMSDKA|5.0|It's rare to see beautiful filmography in an action movie. And though it may be disingenuous to call this an action movie, it absolutely has the underpinnings of one and also has amazing visual artistic qualities.<br /><br />The story itself is going to polarize audiences. There will be two types of viewers: The type that sees an odd action movie and the type that sees a philosophical statement on life.  Either audience is going to see the action and novelty aspects, but, as a member of the second group, the movie touches on some very relatable, tender points regarding the early stages of life and coming of age.<br /><br />The entire movie is wrapped around the vague notion of Grimm's fairy tales and though it doesn't attempt to draw any direct metaphors, they certainly allude to them along the way.<br /><br />This is the first movie in almost 10 years that I've intentionally watched multiple times in the theatre. It's an experience and it's as enjoyable the second time as the first.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

And that's a good thing to understand. ;)
1594744769|1.0|If I had been asked while reading this book, I would have said that it was a very good book, and maybe a great book.  Then I ran out of pages, in the middle of the story, not even really at a \\"breathing space\\" as at the end of the first book of a good trilogy.  He just stopped writing: best you could say was that he finished a paragraph.  I felt cheated, as if I had purchased a defective edition, and there were no perfect ones in the store.  This is the kind of cliff-hanger that is intended to get you to pick up the next issue of the magazine for the serial.  What makes me angriest is that I probably _will_ buy the obviously coming next book.  But there should have been some warning on the cover that this was an incomplete version.    I gave it only one star, deliberately to bring the average down.  If there had been a proper ending, or even a natural pause, I'd have given it five.  It took me completely into its world, which makes the cliff-hanger worse.  If it hadn't been such good writing, I could have shrugged and walked away:  \\"lousy book\\".
B004EPYZOO|5.0|This is a fun film where the morals are very highly delineated, and the sense of purpose is very clear. As one amazing morality play, it fits perfectly in a corrupt world, and in a world where film makers are made to adhere to an arbitrary code, Lussier and Cage, collaborate to make a film of mythic proportions. For those stuck on issues about the F bomb, please note that Milton never swears once during the entire film. He has a pure sense of purpose with a not so pure method ( now where in real life have we heard those points before ???? :-)... mmm, well, just about every war in  at least the last 20 years). The film is made to entertain however, the modern films are the worlds mythology. This realm is where in one scene Milton promises to drink out of Frank's skull, and achieves that in the end scenes. The sense of dramatic come-uppance that the bad guys get is very tangible, as is the surreal way it is delivered. After all, this is not reality, this is escapism. Watch this film without some preconceptions, and you might see the massive mythic component, and one has to do with the sacrifice of the baby ... check out what satan's minions ( Milton and the accountant) have to say about the Cult's viewpoint. But as Lussier says in the commentary, you make up your mind. And also check out the images I dropped into the shared image area about the coin, and the God-killer, I would love to see what you have to say in your review, but please watch the film ( it is a fun film to watch , and I do have morals) before writing your review. Also, listen to the commentary.<br />  And to Emphasize the fun side: the title of this film comes from the Bill Murray film GROUND HOG DAY , where Bill tells Phil not to Drive Angry before he goes off the cliff.

B003EYVXXW|5.0|Historical epics about the Roman Empire tend to fall into 3 categories.  First are the grand action flicks featuring some sort of power struggle atop the empire as the context of the personal dramas.  These films include Cleopatra, Gladiator, and Spartacus.  Then there are the movies that take place at the peripheries of the empire, and usually involve wild tribes, foreign powers, and long dangerous hikes through forests.  Examples of this sub-genre include Last Legion, The Eagle, King Arthur, and Centurion.  The third category, and the most rare, are films that examine the transformation of the people and culture within the Empire, usually by religion.  The best-known example is probably Ben-Hur, which at heart, is an examination of the Jewish experience within the Empire.  Now we have Agora, which looks at the rise of Christianity within the Empire, and how it supplants both the older pagan beliefs, and its predecessor Jewish faith.  Within this context is the story of Hypatia, one of the most notable female philosophers with the ancient world.  This movie recreates her life and intellectual pursuits, which she can pursue due to her aristocratic and privileged life, and shows how it is drowned out by growing Christian faith, a faith built on those excluded from the aristocracy and privilege.  This movie, probably better than any other I have ever seen, shows how the Dark Ages came about as a direct result of the structure of the Roman empire.  Great movie!

B005AUWY90|2.0|The original Cars in one of Pixar's more conflicted movies when it comes to a consensus. Some like it a little, some hate it. I thought it was alright, sort of. Unfortunately, Cars 2 succeeds in removing a lot about what made me like the first movie.<br /><br />Cars 2 shifts the focus from racecar Lightning McQueen (Owen Wilson) to Mater (Larry the Cable Guy). The two of them head off to the World Grand Prix, only for Mater's carelessness to cause his friend to lose the first race. After being yelled at by the racecar, Mater decides that he should just go back home, only to be mistaken for a deep cover CIA agent by British spy Finn McMissile (Michael Cain). Thus Mater must help to stop a villainous plot and save the Grand Prix racers.<br /><br />I like Mater, I've always liked Mater, and I got some genuine laughs from Larry the Cable Guy's performance. At first I didn't think they could possibly do anything with the \\"they think he's X and he accidentally makes it looks like he's X\\" setup, but it actually works and Mater turns out to be a resourceful guy after all. Another stand-out car his Cain's Finn McMissile. Ever wanted to see anthropomorphic cars beat each other up? I didn't think I did either, but the filmmakers found creative and fun ways to make it happen when McMissile squares off against the villains. Unfortunately, a lot of the spy stuff is out of place in a comedy that's only mildly amusing to anyone who isn't a kid. Younger viewers may be uncomfortable when some of the cars die, for instance.<br /><br />Aside from those two, John Turturro's Italian Formula One car Francesco Bernoulli provides a fun, arrogant rival for McQueen. One of things I liked about the first Cars was all the characters in Radiator Springs, like Doc Hudson, Sarge, Fillmore, Luigi, and the others (except Sally, she's bland). Here, they're shoved aside and barely do anything (and Doc Hudson seems to be...dead?). This leaves us with strait man McQueen dealing with and reacting to whatever Mater does. Mater and McQueen are the only ones in the emotional spotlight, but their relationship doesn't progress, it retreads what's been done before. Racecar yells at tow truck, tow truck pouts, you know how it is. By the end of the movie, Mater and McQueen haven't moved forward, they've only solved a problem they've solved before. Mater's personal conflict about being oneself and realizing he's a nuisance beats you over the head with its message.<br /><br />At least the visuals are great. Not just technically, but you also get the feeling that you're in a world of vehicles. You get to see cars in planes, cars in theaters, cars in bathrooms, lots of stuff.<br /><br />If you're an adult, Cars 2 probably won't impress you like most other Pixar films have, aside from the action and a few of the better jokes. I'm not a little kid, but I'm guessing I would like this movie a whole lot more if I was. The better aspects, especially Mater, are enough to save this movie from the brink of abysmal suck, for me anyway. Overall, Cars 2 just isn't that good.ever Mater does.

1594744769|3.0|This is going to be one of the most difficult reviews I have ever written. Many say that the journey is more important than the destination.  But for me, the ending of this book was about as good as it gets.  I finally finished this story that has so many characters that one has difficulty sorting all of them out.  I really enjoy good fantasy, but this was just too much and not at all for young adults. I'm not even certain that it is for the mature reader.  All sorts of children with their peculiarities, sets the stage for a rather long and at times boring read.  If not for the amazing photos which the author claims are real, I would have trashed it about 1/2 the way through.  And I am still not convinced that the photos are real. Just a rather boring read. But OMG, it is different and a bit creepy.

B000ETRCMQ|5.0|Unfortunately, I only just recently discovered this interesting and well-made 2005 film starring Felicity Huffman (from Desperate Housewives).  The movie tells the unique story of a transgender woman, Bree Osbourne, who's in the process of preparing for her sex reassignment surgery when she discovers to her shock that she has a son.<br /><br />The thought of being a father wasn't easy for Bree; she was in the final process of fully embracing her female identity, so finding out she had fathered a son while in college was more than a little untimely.<br /><br />At first she wanted to just send her son, Toby, a nice check to help bail him out of jail and then never see him again.  But her therapist insisted that Bree make contact with her son.<br /><br />As a result of her therapist's encouraging, Bree bails Toby out of jail.  Transamerica follows Bree and her 17-year-old  son, Toby, on their unusual road trip across America while Bree tries decide how to tell Toby that she is actually his father.  And they both slowly get to know each other.<br /><br />The film does a great job of highlighting some of the challenges Bree encounters due to her pre-operative transsexual status.  While having lunch at a small diner a little girl turns around in her chair, looks Bree over curiously, and then asks, \\"Are you a boy or a girl?\\"  Bree awkwardly looks at the girl, unsure how to answer because her biological sex is still male but the gender identity she has chosen for herself is clearly female.<br /><br />Later in the film when Toby runs off, Bree encounters another awkward situation when the police officer asks her, \\"What is your relationship to Toby?\\"  With a deep breath she admits to being his father, completely blowing her cover and possibly subjecting herself to further embarrassment or even discrimination.  I cannot even fully imagine what it would be like to deal with the daily challenges of being a pre-operative transsexual; not knowing how to explain your life to others and afraid they'd only respond curly if you did bother help them understand.<br /><br />Family was definitely a huge challenge for Bree in the movie.  When she was at her parents' house her dad told her, \\"We both love you.\\"  While her mom added, \\"But we don't respect you!\\"  What a horrible thing to have anyone say.<br /><br />Bree's decision to identify as a woman and undergo a sex-change operation frightened her mother because it was so different, completely outside the box.  Her mother seemed to also fear the idea of other people \\"finding out\\" because she wanted her family to appear \\"normal.\\"  She was afraid of the reactions and embarrassment that might follow if people found out that her son was now her daughter.  But in focusing so much on what \\"other people\\" thought, Bree's mom made an already difficult, isolating situation even worse.<br /><br />Transamerica deals with some mature and complicated themes surrounding Bree's pre-operative transsexual status and briefly related to Toby's part-time job as a male hustler.  It's not for children, but movie is a great opportunity for teens and adults to learn how to empathize with members of the population that are often misunderstood and marginalized.<br /><br />It's a unique and entertaining film, but Transamerica's best feature is how fully developed Bree's character is because it allows people who would normally never even think about some of the challenges transsexuals face to see how delicately something like a decision to identify as the other gender needs to be handled because when it's not handled carefully, people who are already marginalized end up hurt even more.ond curly if you did bother help them understand.

It's a unique and entertaining film, but Transamerica's best feature is how fully developed Bree's character is because it allows people who would normally never even think about some of the challenges transsexuals face to see how delicately something like a decision to identify as the other gender needs to be handled because when it's not handled carefully, people who are already marginalized end up hurt even more.
0141301104|1.0|This is the worst children's book I have ever read! Not only is it disturbing : boiling children's bones and frying their skin?!! It is confusing for struggling readers....the chapter with all the words with 'v' added to them. Plus Dahl is an awful writer - very redundant and boring descriptions. I know so many kids in my sons class that hate it. Dahl has been quoted to say \\" get a sense of humor\\" regarding his critics. I do, but not as warped as his.
B0045HCJKS|4.0|\\"Westworld\\" is a great movie that shouldn't be great. The concept is more Twilight Zone then cinematic. A decadent robot playland where things go wrong??? The filmmakers did a perfect job of balancing suspense and horror with comedy and satire. This is hardly a highbrow production so it must have been by chance. They stumbled upon \\"lightening in a bottle\\".<br /><br />Yul Bryner was the ironic perfect choice as the villianous robot that went awry...perfect because although he was a famous actor, I don't think that anybody could nave pictured him as a monstrous cowboy robot yet, his portrayal was very effective. His performance and strong physical presence made this movie.<br /><br />This movie starts out with creating an adult playland, a place where nerds can have trysts with the [robot] girl of their dreams.  The premise is erotic and comedic. The movie focuses a lot on these fun loving, perverted, patrons so when things go bad, the viewer empathizes with those characters which make the suspense and horror effective. When bad things happen to characters with development, the emotions are high. Once everything goes technically wrong in the movie (meaning the robots kill a lot of the guests), the rest of the shifts to a chase drama where Yul Bryner for some reason has a personal vendetta against the protagonist. It works quite well since now the adult theme park takes on a horrific appearance.<br /><br />The surprising aspect of this movie is that it holds up very well and despite the \\"Disney World\\" spin, it can be related to a contemporary audience.<br /><br />Interestingly, the sequel \\"Futureworld\\" was terrible.
B0050CQY1W|3.0|As I listened to this album, a thought came into my mind: Her albums are usually \\"cute\\", but they are never timeless. Her albums are always hit or miss to me. There is never any true consistency. She is good with creating catchy hooks and good dance songs, and there is always a nice ballad or two, but she has never had a 5-star album. However, to her credit, her vocals are extremely strong on this fourth LP. She has never sounded better, she has never sounded more sure of herself, so there is growth somewhere worth mentioning.<br /><br />Out of the twelve tracks, \\"Party\\" and \\"Love on Top\\" are the only selections I granted 5 stars to. I really enjoyed \\"I Was Here\\" and gave 4.5 stars to that song. Everything else is just okay. \\"I Miss You\\" is my least favorite, however. It has an outer space feel to it. The production isn't good and her delivery isn't either. \\"Party\\" is a cool, fresh, different song that I always enjoy. I really like the hook. Andre 3000 does an okay job with his rap. \\"I Was Here\\" is easily the most profound track here. It is well-written and executed beautifully by Beyonce'. And remember I was telling you about how great her vocals are on this album? Well, this is a dynamic vocal performance, believe me. \\"Countdown\\" and \\"1+1\\" are favorites among music listeners, but I cannot truly say I liked the songs. They're catchy, but neither song is my cup of tea. \\"Run the World\\" irritates me because the lyrics are extremely juvenile. Someone who has done so much for the industry of music seems to be going backwards. This is a song a child could compose and sing. A four-year old child. I mean come on, let's be honest here.<br /><br />Honestly, if you do not add this album to your music collection you will not be missing a whole lot. Even her best tracks here aren't groundbreaking.<br /><br />Mikeisha's Top 5<br /><br />1. \\"I Was Here\\"<br />2. \\"Countdown\\"<br />3. \\"Party\\"<br />4. \\"Run the World (Girls)\\"<br />5. \\"End of Time\\"
B004EPYZTE|5.0|Conan the Barbarian as a film is about as subtle as getting shot in the privates with a paint ball gun. It's near impossible to judge this as a \\"good\\" film in the traditional sense. I have no doubt that many people are going to hate it, including some, if not many, Robert E. Howard fans. But as a film in the grindhouse tradition, it's a friggin' masterpiece. I grew up on Robert E. Howard, but it's certainly not all that I grew up with. Somewhere along the way, I developed a taste for shocking exploitation cinema as well, and I attribute this love, at least in some part, to my love of Howard. I love The Evil Dead Trilogy, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Stuart Gordon Lovecraft films, The Pinky Violence Collection, and The Sword and the Sorcerer, just to name a few. Having just learned about its existence, I really want to see \\"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\\". \\"But why??? Why would you possibly want to see a film like that?\\" Well, to quote Randall from Clerks 2, \\"Because its f'd up, that's why!\\" Having said that, I feel like I've just witnessed one of the greatest exploitation films of all time, and I'll be shocked if this doesn't become something of a cult classic among those of us who \\"get it\\". As far as \\"getting it\\" is concerned, either you do or you don't, and if I have to explain it to you, you wouldn't understand, but I would ask the question, \\"What is grindhouse cinema if not the cinematic equivalent of pulp fiction?\\" \\"Well yeah\\", some might say, \\"Robert E. Howard wrote for the pulps, but his writings transcend the limitations and the bad clichés that exemplify the vast majority of the pulp medium\\". And I agree, but when talking about exploitation cinema, so does the Evil Dead Trilogy and Reanimator, and in my opinion, so does this film.  Robert E. Howard's fiction is full of deep philosophical subtext, but we're kidding ourselves if we think that the baser, more exploitation oriented material isn't in there as well. Just ask Margaret Brundage. Going back to my earliest days as a fan, I still remember hiding my Savage Sword of Conan magazines from my parents, because I knew that those Frazetta inspired covers with the perfectly proportioned females, their breasts fully exposed save for silver dollar sized brass pasties, would likely throw my Mom into a tirade. But even the comics did little to prepare me for the real thing, that is, Robert E. Howard's prose. When I first started reading the Lancers, I was shocked at how brutal and graphic it was.    But I digress. About the film: outside of the horror genre, I can't recall a film in recent memory that's so in your face, so completely unabashed and unapologetic, so \\"I really don't give a **** what you think\\" in forwarding its ideological agenda. And yes, there is an underlying philosophy here, though you might miss it amiss the chaos and mayhem. In terms of sheer audacity, the only recent non-horror film that even remotely comes to mind is \\"The Passion of the Christ\\". As far the Sword and Sorcery genre of film is concerned, I can't think of a single film to compare it to. Conan the Barbarian is the first of its kind.    \\"But Rotten Tomatoes gives it a rating of 27%. How can all of these people possibly be wrong?\\" Good question! Let me try my best to explain. While waiting for the film to start, I was subjected to what they like to call the \\"pre-show entertainment\\", and let me tell you, if every sinner is subjected to their own personal Hell after death, then this would be pretty close to mine. I felt like I had to endure wave upon wave of the most insipid crap one could imagine. A painfully unfunny sitcom where a wife seeks to spice up her and her husband's love life by dressing up as a sexy nurse and making him fill out patient information forms. Taylor Lautner, with his adorable little pug nose, trying to pass himself off as an action hero as he mutters \\"Not if I find you first!\\" in his little girly man voice. This is what passes for entertainment these days? Apparently, yes, orthey wouldn't continue making it. \\"Oooo! That looks good\\". Uh...yeah. I have a strong suspicion that there's a significant overlap between the kind of people who consider this stuff to be quality entertainment and those who post comments such as \\"Oh God! Not another remake!\\" and \\"Looks like Prince of Persia meets Clash of the Titans to me\\" on film forums. A long time ago, before this film was made, I referred to them as the ignorant masses, and I think my characterization was spot on. In my own twisted and demented view of the world, these are people virtually devoid of anything that even remotely passes for an imagination, or the capacity for independent thought. \\"Roger Ebert gives it a bad review, so that settles it\\". That's not a joke, by the way. People are actually saying it. Robert E. Howard had another word for them: civilized, and this is not a film that was made for civilized people.    Ridley Scott's \\"The Hour of the Dragon\\", which redefined and reinvigorated the Sword and Sorcery genre of film while racking up several Oscar nominations, and for the first time in 80 years put Robert E. Howard's fiction on the best seller list, is a film that I'd love to see. And in some parallel universe I'm sure Howard fans are raving about it. But in this universe, that's not the film we got. I love Gladiator. I love Kingdom of Heaven. I love Braveheart; not to mention Alexander Nevsky and The Seven Samurai. I certainly have no problem with Oscar worthy historical epics, and I know them when I see them. But Ridley Scott is, after all, a civilized filmmaker. Even at his R rated best, there's a line that the conventions of a polite society dictates that he won't cross. Or at least he hasn't crossed it yet. Marcus Nispel completely ignores such boundaries. In fact, he brazenly steps over them, drops his pants, and waves his private parts at those who are appalled at such behavior. In a hypothetical universe, I think a Conan film directed by Peter Jackson would be amazing.But instead of the Peter Jackson who directed Lord of the Rings, how about the Peter Jackson who directed Brain Dead? Or Sam Raimi before he got his hands on Spiderman? In other words, before these filmmakers were corrupted by civilization. I truly believe that this is the Conan film that we got. In the best tradition of Howard, Nispel puts forth the question of barbarism vs. civilization and unequivocally sides with the barbarian, and not so much in terms of the story, but in the methods he uses to tell the story. \\"Not so fast\\", you say, \\"One can explore the inherent struggle between barbarism vs. civilization and challenge the decorum of polite society without all this gratuitous crap. We don't need to see people's noses getting chopped off, people peeing themselves, and women being disrespected to convey that message.\\" In other words, we don't need to be shaken out of our civilized comfort zone to be shaken out of our civilized comfort zone. I disagree. Just look at some of the more \\"respectable\\" films that explore the same themes, such as Deliverance or A Clockwork Orange, films which use some of the conventions of grindhouse cinema to get their point across.    This almost palatable contempt for the conventions of polite society and those who adhere to it is best exemplified by Momoa himself. Rarely is the point of view of the protagonist and that of the director in such perfect synch. As for Momoa, he's like a big jungle cat, which is the highest compliment I can think of. In capturing the character that Robert E. Howard put down on paper, he nailed it. He absolutely nailed it. In the hands of a lesser actor, this film could have been an unmitigated disaster, but Momoa IS the film. He's in virtually every scene, which is fortunate, because his performance is a joy to behold. I was quite literally dumbfounded by how spot on it was. This is a character with virtually no regard for the \\"rules\\" of civilized behavior, a character that would not be slightly abashedabout nailing a pirate queen on the deck of her own ship with the entire crew looking on, a character who is willing to do on a whim things that most \\"civilized\\" people would not even consider, such as deliberately getting himself arrested and subsequently slaughtering the entire police force to get his hands on his intended target. I can only imagine how some feminists will be outraged at his treatment of Tamara, but that's the whole point. She's civilized, and as such, she lives with the illusion that the pillars of civilization guarantee her a basic level of dignity and equality. Conan, on the other hand, has no such illusions. He knows innately that civilization is just an illusion, and that beyond its boundaries no one is guaranteed any level of self autonomy unless they are physically able to enforce it for themselves. So yeah, she gets a gag stuffed in her mouth. She doesn't get to talk just because she thinks she has a \\"right\\" to. A hard lesson, but a valuable one nonetheless.     \\"But what about the story?\\" Well, it's a pastiche, but I would certainly rate it higher than most Conan pastiches I read, which is something of a miracle, considering the fact that about half of it is written by Donnelly and Oppenheimer (with MAJOR improvements by Sean Hood, god bless him). The opening sequence, in which Morgan Freeman starts reading from the Nemedian chronicles, was so absurdly over the top that my initial gut reaction was bad flashbacks of \\"Kull the Conqueror\\". It was like riding in the passenger seat down the highway, safely along, when all of the sudden your driver has a spontaneous psychotic meltdown and swings the car off the road. And then, the birth scene; Jesus! I found myself going \\"Really? I mean, really???\\" It wasn't even the premise of the scene that really got to me. It was how so over the top and melodramatic the film was in depicting it. But then, somehow, miraculously, it didn't manage to land in the ditch. It got better. Much, much better. Or worse, depending on how you look at it. Leo Howard was totally convincing in his brief stint on young Conan, and I absolutely loved the scene with him against the Picts. Khalar and Marique are sufficiently over the top and scenery chewing (as well as creepy...really, REALLY CREEPY). Conan is given a literal rogues gallery of colorful villains, both male and female, to kill; all of them one dimensional, but damn fun to watch nonetheless.     I have to say I loved the look of the film, and I thought the cinematography was impressive, not to mention the natural scenery of Bulgaria. I think it really captured the look of the Hyborian Age as Howard described it. I loved the actions scenes. Absolutely loved them. I think the film totally delivered on the sheer carnage factor. And let's admit it, that's a huge part of Conan's appeal, and this film has a pre-gunpowder body count that rivals \\"Lone Wolf and Cub\\". Momoa's speed and agility with a sword were nothing short of amazing to watch, and I've never seen sword work on film that looked quite like this, and I've seen plenty of sword films, both eastern and western. \\"Unorthodox, but instinctive and natural as that of a timber wolf\\"; yeah, I think Momoa nailed it. The music? It was just sort of there. It carried the story, but it didn't particularly draw attention to itself. There were no distinctive and hummable leitmotifs that I can recall, which in itself is a disappointment. Tyler Bates has delivered better in the past.     So, to sum things up now, when I read some of the initial reviews, I was worried that I was going to be hugely disappointed, so I tried my best to watch the film with my purist goggles off. But as it turns out, the Howard purist in me is perfectly okay with it as well, and ultimately that's the highest compliment I can think of. I know that there are people who will vehemently disagree with me on every point, and I'm perfectly okay with that. Honest. I'll be sorely disappointed if there are not future installments, but even if not, at least I'll have this film. If I can't get a filmed version of a genuine Howard story, at least I'll have a Conan film that gets the character right. Jason Momoa: YOU ARE THE MAN! I want to take home the unrated Blu-Ray Extended Edition and get gloriously drunk while watching it. Repeatedly. Did I forget to mention that Conan is fun?    And in case anyone hasn't noticed by now, I've made quite a deliberate point of not bringing up the Milius film, nor comparing the two. Suffice it to say, if this were the film I had seen in 82, I think I would have been very happy indeed.
0393338827|5.0|Quick service.  Love the used books that I purchase.  The Big Short was an absolutely fascinating read.  Learned a lot about the inner workings of Wall Street and web that is woven.
B000002GKT|3.0|This is all high octane, low drag 70s rock with loud guitars.  I love rock guitars; I love how they sound; I love looking at them; I love playing them.  Some  people like fancy sports cars or antique paintings.  I love guitars.  Even a cheap Squier looks good to me.  I especially like when a guitar is played through an amp at just the right distortion.  And a lot of these songs involve catchy riffs that are simple to play.  Fun stuff.<br /><br />I don't like the singing.  I can't imagine how tight that guy's pants must have been to get a voice like that. I never understood the appeal of the high pitched male vocal though.  I like girls' voices, but when a so-called man sings in a high pitched squeal it just doesn't do it for me.  I've always thought men should aspire to be masculine.  The Barry White George Clinton deep voices tell me that the singer is a masculine male with lots of testosterone.  I don't know why a man would sing with a high pitched girlish squeal.<br /><br />There's something about a studio that just takes the life blood out of rock and blues music.  I don't know what it is; I'm not a recording artist.  But the live recordings where the performers are energized by the excitement of the crowd whether it's a big crowd or a small crowd.

B0002V7O3I|3.0|Our family was thoroughly enjoying this adventure about three boys who go on the adventure of a lifetime, when it suddenly took a horrifying turn.<br /><br />This film starts out with Ben (an impossibly young Ethan Hawke) dreaming and then getting his brainy friend Wolfgang (River Phoenix) to build the circuit he saw in his dream. When they do, it leads to them building a spaceship which leaves Earth's atmosphere. To this point Explorers was rollicking fun and '80s awesome. THEN, when their ship is taken up into an alien craft, it totally derails. MILD SPOILER: The kids meet with aliens in rubber costumes who love Hollywood movies and act whacky, and the film is a mess from then on.<br /><br />We LOVED the first hour, and HATED the rest. A for the start, D- for the end, C average.
0345529057|2.0|So I decided to pick this series up after I heard about the HBO series.  I only made it through book 1 and halfway through book 2 before I had to set it down.    Pros:  Martin is a good writer, and the world he has created is fairly interesting.  Editing did a good job as I noticed very few typos and errors of that nature.  Good value for your money, you get about 3700 pages with very small margins and print for 19.99.    Cons:  To preface the cons, I didn't like this series and I didn't finish it.  This rarely happens I honestly have only ever put down a few books before finishing them.  1:  These books are way to long.  The author goes into a lot of the same kind of details over and over again about what people are wearing and what different banners look like ect...  While it was nice for awhile, it gets very repetitive and boring.  And as I understand it there is now a 5th book with no end in site.      2:  Lack of a central story/plot and main characters.  These books read like a soap opera, there really are no main characters, and major personalities die off at a regular basis.  Honestly I do not believe the author had a central plan for the story.  Many points in the story something the author has been building up for quite awhile turns out to be nothing and gets a very sub-par conclusion.  Feels like the author didn't really have a direction/plan he wanted to go with and is just kind of going with the flow. And like I said earlier the story just seems to drag on and on and I only made it through about 1500 pages.    3:  Way to many sub plots and far to many different points of view.    4:  People say that this book is realistic, well I disagree with that.  It is realistic if you believe that 99% of people are murderers and rapists.  The violence is way over the top and I'm not talking about battles, I mean random murder of children, women, old people.  Also the sexual violence described in the book is pretty bad as well and some form of rape is described/mentioned probably every 3rd page or so.  Random violence and things of that nature really irk me though, so I am biased in that respect.    I gave this set 2 stars because it is good value if your looking for pulp fiction to occupy your time with.  Otherwise it would be 1 star.  I honestly recommend people to buy the first book and read it before they commit to buying the rest of the books.  And this series is not for anyone under 15 at a minimum.
B003HE2B6C|5.0|This is probably one of their best albums so far. I recommend it for people who enjoyed their previous albums but are also looking for something that sounds different.
B002JVWR4A|4.0|its great fun to be learning and watching interesting personal relationships playing at the same time.add a little drama and have excellent entertainment
1400052173|5.0|I knew nothing about the subject of the book when I ordered this.  I was immediately drawn into the story in the first chapter.  Excellent writing style, informative and interesting without being overly technical.  I have already shared it with a number of people and hope the word spreads about the fund for the family of Henrietta Lacks.
B005BGBPBG|3.0|Movie had some ups and downs but very predictable ending.  Even my wife thought it was only  3 star movie and we both would have liked little more comedy.
B0052AJ1OO|4.0|This disc was hard to find immediately after the movie's release. I guess they wanted to make as much as they could from downloads before it could be bootlegged off of CD or even the 12\\" vinyl version - which WAS released - but would get snapped up by collectors and sold secondary for ridiculous prices. Finally it's on CD and it's a great Chemical Brothers album by itself - if you're a fan of their music. It's right up there with their work on the \\"Fight Club\\" soundtrack (which they did as the \\"Dust Brothers\\") - which to me, really brought us into the modern age of digital music movie soundtracks. Sure, there were those before them, but few as impressive.
B000S1M9LY|2.0|I'm reading my first Kindle book, David Foster Wallace's \\"Infinite Jest\\" -- not an easy book, to be sure, but an excellent book to read on the Kindle: It's a huge, heavy block in regular print form, and the Kindle is light and small.  However (and I don't know if this is typical because it's my first Kindle book), there are *so* many typos, this reminds me of some pretty bad software I used many years ago that would scan text from a print document and then supposedly translate it  to computer-readable form.  This software sorta worked, but it was messy, often inaccurate, and required lots of by-hand editing.  Is this how Kindle editions are being created?  If so, the software's still pretty bad, and it's really not a lot of fun to read a book with typos.      Not a good first impression, Kindle.  And Amazon charges not only for the typo-strewn books, but the device that allows us to read them??  I must be missing something here.....
B001MEJX0Q|4.0|This is basically the third movie disc of the Ultimate Matrix set. I had that set on dvd and didn't want to upgrade the whole thing to blu-ray, but I did want to at least have the movies by themselves on blu-ray. My wish came true when Wal Mart started selling 'The Matrix' and 'Matrix Reloaded' in what was basically their bargain bins. They were the movies with ALL the features on them for 10 or 8 dollars - something like that. Upgrades. So I waited and waited to see if 'Matrix Revolutions' would be sold that way - but no - it never appeared. It was like it was stuck in that train station that Neo is stuck in, in this movie. So I paid the 20-25 bucks from one of the other sellers to get it before it disappeared entirely from retailers. THIS IS a Canadian disc, by the way, so it might act a little weird when your player gets it but if your firmware is up-to-date then it should still play. For whatever reason they must have simply decided not to sell this movie by itself in the States so if you find it by itself from one of the other retailers, it's a Canadian disc and that may be why the price is a little higher. They ARE coming out in the U.S. with this on a double movie blu-ray disc in September '11 along with 'Matrix Reloaded' and THAT disc may show up in bargain bins at the big boxes but I don't think it'll have the extra features on it. Some little complications you have to go through if you're trying to collect these by themselves on blu-ray.
B004UXUUDA|2.0|First, I didn't hate this movie.  This summary won't contain spoilers because it's worth seeing if only for the acting.  I am very big fan of Kristen Scott Thomas.  Her work in [[ASIN:B001GCUO6Q I've Loved You So Long [Blu-ray]]]was Oscar-worthy.  Her acting here is no-less perfect, but the script she is working suffers from a lack of common sense.  The story of French Jews deported into the hands of Nazis is worth telling, but the way it's done here is awkward and fragmented.  The present day mystery angle, where Thomas comes in, is also interesting, but the writer delved into scenes that truly wore on my patience.  For instance, when she is trying to track down a certain character in present day New York City, she has to take a cab from address to address to address trying to find who she is looking for.  Why could she have not used a telephone and saved herself the time?  Also, she has to fly all over the world to see some people, where she could have just done it either on the phone, e-mail, etc.  If the mystery portion of the film was set pre-Internet, than maybe I could buy more of this.  Also, when a group of characters make a discovery in an apartment, children are present in a moment where no adult in their right mind would allow them to be.  It was quite ludicrous.  So while this film gets high marks for acting and cinematography, don't expect to love it - and DO expect to roll your eyes quite a bit. 2.5 out of 5.
B003M8NG94|4.0|*** REVIEW FOR THE BLU RAY REISSUE  ***<br /><br />I hadn't looked at my DVD of Tim Burton's ridiculously over-the-top homage to Fifties Sci-Fi movies in years - and I was stunned at two things when I popped this 2010 BLU RAY reissue in my Sony - first - the massive improvement in picture quality - and second - just how ball-breakingly funny \\"Mars Attacks!\\" actually is.<br /><br />At times the great picture quality is a shock after the dull DVD I've been used to since 1996 - there's tremendous clarity on offer on almost all of the internal scenes. And the upgrade has somehow made the film seem all grown-up all of a sudden - a real contender for an all-time comedy classic too easily dismissed as fluff when it was released.<br /><br />Genuinely anarchic in a way so few movies are these days, you also forget how good and varied the cast was... Glenn Close plays the President's fussy uptight wife Marsha Dale (\\"...they're not eating off the bone china, I can tell you that...\\"), Pierce Brosnan is brilliant as the pipe-smoking Professor Donald Kessler forever with a reasonable explanation about 'cultural misunderstandings' and why the Martians are delighting in ray-gunning everything in sight. Donald also has the hots for airhead news reporter Natalie Lake played deftly by Sarah Jessica-Parker (she and her irritating Chihuahua dog end up closer than they should at one point). Martin Short plays the permanently randy White House Press Secretary Jerry Ross (Lisa Marie does a great turn as a alien prostitute), Annette Bening as a dizzy hippy-chick saving her glass pyramid in her handbag as the Aliens wreck Vegas and Rod Steiger is just fabulously tacky as General Decker - the military dinosaur whose battle cry of \\"Kill! Kill! Kill!\\" turns out to be right all along.<br /><br />There's Danny DeVito as a gross gambler, Lukas Haas as the only sane kid in a trailer-trash family (\\"...they ain't getting the TV...\\") trying to protect his wheelchair bound aunt (played with relish by Sylvia Stalwart). We get Blaxsploitation stars Jim Brown and Pam Grier as a couple trying to keep their family together (their kids gaming skills come in handy when the aliens attack the Whitehouse). There are even early roles for Jack Black and Natalie Portman before global fame consumed them both - and Tom Jones gives it a bit of swivel-hip as he belts out the irrepressibly brill \\"It's Not Unusual\\". Danny Elfman's score is suitably throwback and brilliantly woven into every scene - it even pays respects to the films Tim Burton so loved by taking the ray gun sound from the 1953 Sci-Fi classic \\"War Of The Worlds\\". And by the time you get to the end - you've enjoyed enough fried doves of peace, bowling balls taking out Easter Island and splattered alien brain matter in glass-dome helmets to keep any customer satisfied.<br /><br />But the real shame of this Blu Ray reissue is the complete lack of any bonus material (not even a trailer for God's sake), when this release screamed out for an orgy of it (definitely docked a star for that).<br /><br />My son Sean watched this with me (he's 14) and we then spent a good hour afterwards going around the TV room squawking \\"Ack Ack!\\" like giggling mayhem-inducing aliens.

Danny Elfman's score is suitably throwback and brilliantly woven into every scene - it even pays respects to the films Tim Burton so loved by taking the ray gun sound from the 1953 Sci-Fi classic \\"War Of The Worlds\\". And by the time you get to the end - you've enjoyed enough fried doves of peace, bowling balls taking out Easter Island and splattered alien brain matter in glass-dome helmets to keep any customer satisfied.     But the real shame of this Blu Ray reissue is the complete lack of any bonus material (not even a trailer for God's sake), when this release screamed out for an orgy of it (definitely docked a star for that).     My son Sean watched this with me (he's 14) and we then spent a good hour afterwards going around the TV room squawking \\"Ack Ack!\\" like giggling mayhem-inducing aliens.

1901464229|5.0|As a Brompton owner, I really wasn't sure what to expect from this book, but it really exceeded any expectations I had had.  As other reviewers have said, the author may have a bit of a pro-Brompton bias, but let's remember what the book is called.  People who own Bromptons probably don't want to read about how wonderful the Bike Friday Tikit is and why they should buy it.    The book has a surprising amount of hard data in it, beautifully accentuated by large photos on practically every single page.  I do come from a scientific background, and some may find the technical data in the book to be a bit much, but I'd wager that if you don't care about the specs then you can just ignore that part of the writing and not lose that much of the crux of the book.    The small section on maintenance should probably be supplemented with the Brompton's factory manual, but it's really helpful for advanced DIY servicing.    Is this book for everyone? Probably not, but I think even non-Brompton owners could enjoy reading it; especially if they like bikes or stories of the most unlikely success.  For being British, Ritchie had a distinctly American flavor to his story.
B004UID2LC|5.0|I really love this app. The search feature makes it really easy to find exactly the you tube video you are looking for. Long press on the video and you can downloaad as a video or an MP3. I use the MP3 feature all the time. Love, love, love this app!!
B004WJREPO|5.0|I've been a McCartney fan since the Wings era and had the great fun of seeing him perform live in concert several times over the years, most recently a couple of months ago.  He's a legendary performer and still has the magic!  This is a great collection of some of Paul's work for this time period in his long career!  Especially enjoyed the video with interview how Paul describes process of writing the songs and putting album together.   Also thought the book was really cool with lots of great pics of Paul, Linda, band members.  Recommend it highly for collectors and long-time McCartney fans!

B004LWZVZC|4.0|I knew almost nothing of the other people involved in the plot to kill Lincoln until I saw this film.  Mary Surratt was railroaded and made to stand trial with no jury because the Civil War was still raging on.       The actors give very credible and moving performances, especially Robin Wright as Mary and the fellow playing her lawyer.      The period design is also excellent, and what happened during this trial should be  reminder to all that you cannot chuck the rules out just because it's expedient or because people want someone to blame.
B001TW69J4|5.0|was checking out this album and its very good, progressive jazz, and i dont understand some of the people here, there always seems to be someone that thinks that playing fast and all that doesnt have any soul and so on, but its usually people with no talent, and im very happy people like this dont waste their talent on writing simple pop/rock stuff that most people can do anyway, we have enough bands doing that. this is very complex and good music that gets some time getting used to, just like prog and jazz should be. but still i like bands like Motley Crue, Alice in chains, soundgarden, Pearl Jam and many more so im not just into this kind of music.  but of course guys like this have soul otherwise they wouldn't have spent this much time playing and being good. just check this album out if you like Dream Theater, Tool, Rush, Opeth or prog overall

0316044695|1.0|Luttrell didn't write the book.  He didn't even read the final draft prior to it going into publication.  Johnson was more than a ghostwriter, he was THE writer, and a poor one at that.        On page 161 it says when they arrived in Afghanistan they were given a lecture on what was happening on the northwest border, which divides Afghanistan and Pakistan.  There is no NW border between those two countries unless you're standing in Pakistan.  A quick look at the map in the front of the book would have told Robinson it was the Afghan northeast border with Pakistan.  Luttrell would never have made that error and he certainly would have caught it had he read it.    Luttrell began his SEAL training in group 226.  When he broke his femur and returned he, understandably, couldn't rejoin group 226 so he was assigned to group 228.  And yet, throughout the entire book, written in the first person, he is in group 226.  Even Gulab is quoted as telling the rescuing Rangers, \\"226, he's 226\\".  I do believe Luttrell wrote the Acknowledgments at the end of the book, and the reason I say that is he refers to his group as being 228.  Had Luttrell bothered to read the finished product he would have spotted the 226 error in a N.Y. half-second.    It gets worse.  On page 170 it states the M4 machine gun caliber is 223.55 mm.  That means it would have a barrel I.D. 8.8\\".  It would be a freakin' canon more than twice the size of a 105mm Howitzer.  The correct caliber is .223\\". There's absolutely no way Luttrell wouldn't have caught that error.  On the same page it says the AK 47 is .762mm.  That's off by a factor of 10 as it's 7.62mm or .30\\" = \\"30 caliber\\", same as the old U.S. carbine.    On page 217 he refers to the Taliban who were attacking as \\".....not really marksmen, using marginal rifles pretty recklessly.....\\", implying they were poorly trained.  But then on page 221 he says Sharmak's \\"...guys were: trained, heavily armed, fearless and strategically on the ball\\".  The AK 47 is anything but a \\"marginal\\" assault weapon. \\"Rifle\\" seems an odd choice of word in this context. An automatic weapon isn't called a rifle. Luttrell would know this.      Perhaps you think I'm being nit-pickey, but I don't think the above is nit-picking.  I think it points out glaring errors that never should have made it to the final print.  It raises a question as to the credibility of the recounting of the battle and the events followed.     One last thing.  You'll recall the first night of Hell Week?  Guys entering the room firing machine guns (with blanks, of course).  You remember the confusion, the chaos, the panic?  Granted, Luttrell had a lot of training following that night, but I seriously question his ability to remember so much fine detail about the battle.  Him being so specific in exactly what happened and their sequence.  I question not only that, but also how he could even know in such detail what was going on with the others.  Not while trying to dodge a hail of automatic weapons fire and RPGs.      I think the book title should have been \\"Lone Survivor - Based on a True Story\\".   I also think Robinson chose the wrong profession.
0977326403|4.0|Anyone who's read Good to Great will know that the original book is full of great stories about how businesses went from simply being \\"good\\" to being \\"great.\\"  Though some of these companies are not held in the same high esteem they were when Jim Collins wrote the original (Circuit City or Fannie Mae, anyone?) -- the observations he took from those companies are still valid today.<br /><br />The missing piece from Good to Great is how to make the original work for organizations that don't have the bottom line as the driving factor.  Nonprofits still need to have \\"the right people on the bus,\\" \\"Level 5 Leadership,\\" and need to have a \\"hedgehog,\\" but Collins didn't tell us how these applied to the non-business sector.<br /><br />This problem is addressed in this small add-on -- Good to Great and the Social Sectors, a small read that makes it clear on how nonprofits can still apply Good to Great values to their own organizations with mission -- not profit -- in mind.  This work doesn't stand on its own, however; one must read the original book to understand the principles in-depth so they'll make sense when the reader comes upon them in Good to Great and the Social Sectors.<br /><br />As one of the best business and leadership books of the past decade, From Good to Great is a must-read for any for-profit or nonprofit executive, but the latter would be more easily guided in how those principles will work for them in this very reasonably priced followup.

B001UV4XIS|3.0|I have been an unashamed Harry Potter fan since the year 2002, after seeing \\"Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\\" for the first time. The books are without a doubt my favorite fantasy series of all time, and the films some of the best that any major movie studio has ever produced; but that being said, I have to say I was a bit disappointed by the finale as a whole.  This has, in my opinion, a lot to do with J.K. Rowling's treatment of the last novel. Up until book six, I had been mesmerized by the depth and uniqueness of the world she had created and felt that the series couldn't possibly have a bummer in it, seeing as how tightly and carefully the plots were wound and how well the characters were written. But after \\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\", she seemed to lose her grip on the storyline, and \\"Half-Blood Prince\\" and \\"Deathly Hallows\\", while both being incredibly important to furthering the plot concerning the intertwined fates of Harry/Lord Voldemort, seemed so full of incredible faults with their respective titular storylines that they were almost non-cohesive to any of the other novels that had come before them and meandering to the point of absurdity. The introduction of the Half-Blood Prince and the Deathly Hallows always felt largely contrived and nowhere near as significant a McGuffin as say the Goblet of Fire or the Sorcerer's Stone, and often left me wondering why they were even introduced at all. The gripping mystery that often held me in suspense throughout \\"Chamber\\", \\"Goblet\\", or \\"Order\\" just wasn't there, and the brutal and numerous deaths seemed to be thrown in just to create a shock factor.   Although I knew exactly what I was going to see, I viewed this last film simply to achieve closure on a series I dearly loved, and while not my favorite, it was pretty good, despite its faults. While among the most heart-pounding of the Harry Potter films, \\"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Pt. 2,\\", is easily the most heart-wrenching, ranging from scenes of intense cathartic emotion to all the horrific gore and gristle of war. It usually takes a lot to get me to cry in a movie, but this film had me weeping almost continually for at least the last half-hour.   I can't say it was the most enjoyable of the films, because it simply isn't possible to enjoy a movie with so much blood, death and destruction taking place almost every minute; but nevertheless, I liked it, and felt that even the few small changes did much to improve it from the book.  The film starts off at a moderately slow pace, the calm before the storm, and then gradually escalates into a full-blown battle between the forces of Good and Evil. I, like many other reviewers agree that not enough time was spent on the minutiae: the more intimate aspects of the battle, or the deeper expositions of the characters, which should have been explored a bit more, seeing as this is the last outing for them; and that many finer points of the plot were glossed over; but all in all, it had a generally good pace throughout. To those who have read the book, it shouldn't be too much of a problem to understand what's going on.  At some moments, the gruesomeness got to be a bit much for me--I wish that the general carnage (including several beloved characters) had been lessened from Rowling's vision. In fact, I believe that a little more gore was added. I would have appreciated it if even one or two characters had been spared, if only to lessen the faintly drained, depressing feeling at the end that it wasn't all worth it, even after You-Know-Who has been defeated,  because so many people died in the process.  The scriptwriter Steven Kloves did manage to inject a few of his own ideas into the thread, including a re-entrance into the Chamber of Secrets (an incident that was mentioned after-the-fact in the book), or an epic-scale, all-out cat-fight between Harry and Voldemort, in lieu of the cat-and-mouse banter from the pages of the novel. As to the ending, whichis different from the book, I like what the he chose to have Harry do with the Elder Wand. It gives a good insight into Harry's ethics versus those of Dumbledore or Voldemort, who both wanted the wand solely for the immense power they would gain from it.  As for the score, Alexandre Desplat really hit home with it. It is vastly better than his work on \\"DH1\\", and the snippets of Nicholas Hooper's \\"Dumbledore's Farewell\\" and John William's \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" add an element of nostalgia, particularly in the last scene, that is a welcome addition for the final installment.  All of the actors and actresses give their all for this last Potter outing, and there isn't one among them that gives a bad performance. Particularly outstanding this final time around is Alan Rickman as Severus Snape and Daniel Radcliffe as the ubiquitous Harry Potter. The scene between them in the boathouse had me sobbing my eyes out, as did the scene with the Resurrection Stone in the Forbidden Forest. There is no doubt in my mind that both sorely deserve an Academy Award for the sheer brilliance of their performances, and make watching this movie worthwhile, if only to see them so expertly practicing their craft.  Alan Rickman probably has the most screen time of anyone except for Harry himself, due to numerous flashback sequences in the Pensieve, in which Snape's whole arcane history is revealed, albeit somewhat quickly. Rickman is simply incredible, and manages to build sympathy for a character whom most people probably little more than entirely despised as only a true actor can.   Daniel Radcliffe, a person whom I have always believed to be very talented at what he does, comes out swinging in his final performance as the legendary boy wizard. He gives the character such emotional depth and steadfast resolution--he's no longer just Dan Radcliffe playing Harry: he is Harry. I was deeply moved, often to tears, by his outstanding job in this film, something very few actors can achieve with me.  Toconclude my review, \\"DH2\\" is not perfect, but the novel wasn't perfect, either. While the film was lacking in spots and certainly had room for improvement, as a fan, I was quite pleased with it, and feel it was a fairly decent ending for the whole Potter series.

B005F3XV62|4.0|\\"Zookeeper\\" is a funny movie.  As mentioned in the title Kevin James is perfect for the part of Griffin. Griffin is a zookeeper(how convenient for the title) who likes his job and does it well. Unfortunately Griffin's ex-girlfriend Stephanie does not like Griffin's job and thinks he could do so much better.  Stephanie dumps Griffin and that is where the animals come into play as they try to help Griffin win back Stephanie. Hilarity ensues as Griffin takes the animals advice to become a suave gentleman.  Rosario Dawson and Ken Jeong(although I wish he had a bigger part,funny)co-star.  Adam Sandler voices one of the animals, guess which one.  In a summer where any comedy had to be so raunchy and rated R, \\"Zookeeper\\" is a nice change.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved it. I get tired of the same old, same old story lines. This was unique and challenging, not in the text itself, but the content, one needs to get past kids killing kids. I read it like Lord of the Flies in the future and on steroids. (cliche I know) It's like Jack's tribe grew up and took over.

1401929281|3.0|So much controversial about this book; better criticizing someone than to talk at all. This book is worth reading it;  Vianna Stibal gives helpful information on how to improve life, health and spirituality. The technique is usable; the author takes the \\"modality\\" to the farthest; without the evidence of truth, I use my good sense with due respect for the inventor of ThetaHealing.
B0030HAJA6|4.0|I fell in love with the show and thought it was very imaginative to come out with a book by Richard Castle. Makes the character all the more enjoyable. The book is full of familiar wit, which is what you want if you watch the show. The love-hate relationship between characters keeps you turning the pages and the writing is superb. I was a bit disappointed with the shortness of the story and felt they could've added more to keep you going. But if you like Rick Castle and Kate Beckett, you won't be disappointed.    David Lucero, author of THE SANDMAN
1599218011|5.0|The only critic I have about the book is the title: the word \\"Diet\\" doesn't do its content justice. Kris, you should have really called this \\"Crazy Sexy Lifestyle\\", because there is so much more in here than some dietary advice. I have seldom seen a book that is so sparkling, well written, full of vibrant energy, and choke full of extremely important information and recipes for you to get going on a healthier and happier lifestyle. Its main emphasis is on nutrition and how to rid yourself of destructive eating habits, but at the same time embrace life and enjoy the transition.

I have always been a fan of Portia but this book gave me a whole new perspective of her and an even deeper respect for her then I had before.  Any girl out there should read this book--especially younger girls because she talks about things that most young girls deal with--body image.  It is worth the read for sure, I almost finished the book in one sitting and will most definitely be reading this book over and over again.  This book is well worth it.

0553386794|5.0|This book is enjoyable and a great tool for aspiring writers. George RR Martin's character development is the best I've seen in a while. I feel that if someone asked me \\"Would Tyrion open up his own brothel if he could?\\" I would be able to answer that question. My point is, I feel that I know the characters so well I can answer unrelated questions about them. I love every character, even the \\"bad\\" ones. Everyone has a reason for their actions so there is no set villain. The only fantasy aspects are direwolves and dragons at the end. Other than that, this book is more like a period piece and I could see all of this happening in the middle ages. Overall, great, long book to get lost in.

B0000012VG|5.0|I knew little about Mussorgsky before buying this album, except for his \\"Night on Bald Mountain\\", which I had heard conducted by Karajan. I settled on this version - conducted by Abbado - after comparing Abbado and Karajan's versions of the finale to Wagner's Parsifal: Karajan's sound is slick with a solid tempo, but lacks the emotional power and power of Abbado's. The same can be said of Night.<br /><br />This disc is a beautiful collage of stand-alone pieces by Mussorgsky, also including his \\"Pictures at an Exhibition\\". The later is interesting, recalling the folk-inspired pieces of Dvorak and Bartok. But the stand-alone pieces are the real gems, the titular Night soars, but the more ethereal The Destruction Of Sennacherib and joyful Joshua will stay in your memories, and Abbado imbues both with emotion and a tinge of sadness that will haunt you long after the music ends.<br /><br />This CD made me fall in love with Mussorgsky, and led me to his other works (including Boris Godunov, also conducted superbly by Abbado). This CD will make me forgive maestro Abbado almost anything. A window into a fascinating world.
B000JMLFLW|2.0|I started reading this Kindle edition today and was very put off by the ALL CAPS used for emphasis.  There's a version of all Jane Austen's books for $1.99, so I bought that and will delete this one.  The other version has no formatting for the emphasized words (italics would be good), but better than those all caps that make it feel like I'm reading Price & Prejudice via facebook.

The movies stay faithful to the plots and characters. The bonus disc is a nice edition for all things Twilight, for the behind the scenes, and the die-hard fans will enjoy the added comments from the actors.

1451629184|4.0|Jaycee Dugard does an amazing job telling her story in this 273 page memoir (without a co-author) that gives you a first hand look of the true hell she went through during her 18 years of captivity by married couple Philip & Nancy Garrido.  This book provided me with all sorts of emotions throughout reading- anger, extreme sadness, inspiration, hope, and the list goes on. It truly exhibits to the reader not only how monstrous human beings can be but also the amazing adaptation and drive to survive that we as humans possess.  Although the book is graphic at times and may not be best for young readers, I feel that this is part of the true power that this book has to give you a first hand account of the awful 18 years that poor little Jaycee had to endure at the hands of complete strangers.<br /><br />Jaycee's biggest fear was the unknown.  Even though the abuse was awful she got into a routine that she much came to prefer rather than the unpredictability that came when Philip went on his drug-induced \\"runs\\" during which time he would do different things<br /><br />It seems that Jaycee wrote the book not only to inform her captors and the world that they no longer had control of her life but also to exhibit the amazing ability that humans have to endure and get through the most extreme conditions.  It was her hope to provide hope for those individuals who are enduring or have endured traumatic situations of their own.<br /><br />Additionally this book calls out the American Justice System in the way in which sexual molesters/predators are monitored when they are not in prison or jail. Hopefully many eyes will be opened after reading this book in order to change the many failing monitoring systems that have failed Jaycee and many individuals like her.<br /><br />I saw the ABC special with Diane Sawyer prior to reading the book and was immediately struck by Jaycee's genuine good nature and perceived her to be extremely grounded and \\"normal\\" , which I find unbelievable considering the torture that she went through for such a LARGE portion of her life.<br /><br />I absolutely recommend this book to anyone interested and wish Jaycee, her family, and her two children all the best!!he went through for such a LARGE portion of her life.    I absolutely recommend this book to anyone interested and wish Jaycee, her family, and her two children all the best!!
0205632645|4.0|When I was buying the 50th anniversary edition I was a bit concerned because one of the reviews said that the printing was like cheap photocopy. That was not true at all. It is very clean and neat, albeit old-fashioned type. The cover is very much like the texture on bibles, with a slightly leather-like look. The titles and things are in gold (again, like a Bible). The book is thinner than I expected but I see no difficulty reading, etc.

0812550706|1.0|Ender's Game has been recommended to me a few times over the years by folks who have enjoyed it. I have not been reading a great deal of fiction lately and was not really interested in trying Ender, but my next door neighbor's 14-year-old was bugging the snot out of me to read it. He told me that if I did he'd eat vegetables for 7 days! Since he had read a couple of my Robert A. Heinlein recommends, I decided to take him up on the Card novel. Before I go too far I should say that I am NOT a fan of Orson Scott Card as a human being; his cruel activism against gay rights and association with Maggie Gallagher and Bryan Brown on the NOM Board of Directors convinces me that he is one of the forces of oppression in this country, not of liberty. His inability or unwillingness to look past his own bigotry to see the pain he and his church have caused others shows me that he is not an evolved or kind human or devotee of reason, but a slave of doctrine and superstition.<br /><br />Yeah, I do not like the guy. But I am telling you upfront, which is only fair because I do not like this book at all. In fact, I hated it.<br /><br />I tried to like the thing and cannot. The entire book reads fake to me. Nothing is real, and by real I mean believable in the sense of human beings taking part in a story. Ender's brother is simply too cruel, his sister too slavishly devoted, the religion of his parents too pat, their reaction to his recruitment unbelievable, the manipulative school commander completely improbable. Ender is too perfect. And it is like these little explanations keep popping into the story deus ex machina style to explain oddities. I kept noticing things popping into the story, like the sudden revelation of the existence of Mazer Rackham, to be simply awkward. Ender's Game is a big bucket of hack, has been way overhyped by its fans, and is nowhere near deserving of the accolades heaped on it by the fanboy legions. I will not be reading any more Orson Scott Card. And I know a 14-yr-old who will not be eating vegetables for a week, either.ho will not be eating vegetables for a week, either.

B002IKLZZY|5.0|This witty, slick thriller is an iconic classic in motion picture history.  Alfred Hitchcock accomplishes with innuendo and subtlety what most modern directors fail to achieve by bludgeoning audiences over the head. Sure, there's no blood and gore and no gratuitous sex, but with Hithcock's mastery of the camera, the undercurrents in the dialogue, and the twists and turns in the plot, who needs them? The cinematography is legendary, the one-liners are infinitely quotable, and the chemistry between Cary Grant and Eva Marie Saint (pant, pant) is magical.  This is a must-see for classic movie buffs.
0060920084|1.0|This book effectively illustrates the point that left-leaning liberals - in this case the author - can engage in narrow-minded bigotry and intolerance with the best of 'em. Bryson's broad generalizations about people, based on nothing more than geography, accent, or occupation, are at times so hateful that the book is hard to read.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|Well, I am a self-proclaimed, self-titled, very proud, nerd, lover of all things SF and fantasy (Trek, Star Wars, Tolkien - you name it), and this movie had me howling with laughter. So many inside jokes, and a loving/joking tribute to those of us who are part of this world.    Does it contain \\"R\\" rated language? Well, yeah. Hence the rating.    Is every moment funny? Of course not. This type of movie is always risky in that respect.    Does it bash God? Please. I'm a Christian, and a) I don't cling so rigidly to my views that I can't see someone else's POV. and b) if we can't laugh at ourselves, well -- oh, my.    \\"It's not like I set my phaser to 'faint.'\\"  \\"You have a phaser?\\"    Classic!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I'm a relatively new fan to Supernatural but I'd recommend it to anyone that's interested in great characters and great storytelling.<br /><br />Each season gets darker than the previous but the producers have a way of keeping it watchable by mixing in lighter episodes. This season has some solid comedic episodes. Whether it's Monster Movie that is shot like an oldschool monster movie or Yellow Fever which has Dean scared like a little girl, there are plenty of episodes that remain fun, even as we watch Sam spiral down into the darkest part of his soul.<br /><br />The draw to this show for me has always been the relationship between Sam and Dean. The emphasis on family and loyalty is inspiring and if you've been watching the show up until this point it becomes difficult to watch some of the character choices that are made. If you're looking for a great created universe that follows the rules it establishes and an emotional involvement with some great characters, Supernatural is the show for you.
B0058OUJA4|4.0|It seems like a copy of HexDefense.  Right down to the graphics and color scheme.  I guess that's a complement, HexDefense is a great game, but it is a little odd something so similar coming from a different studio.
B004SKIPXW|1.0|I hoped I had found a gem, Boy was I wrong. This should be labeled a horror movie. Because it is a horrid, horrid, movie. It makes no sense it deserves to be placed in hell where the main characters go in the end. The chases are dumb they waste some great cars for no good reason. The plot is crazy. It could have used more sex and less pretense that way it could have been classified as porn. This movie is an insult to porn.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|I wouldn&apos;t hesitate to get this while its free because its worth 1.99 imo. Great job developers! 20 words now.
B0051MKMNC|3.0|A waste of a good idea. The chance meeting and the plot that follows are poorly developed. If this was better produced it would have been very entertaining. Perhaps someone else will get the story and make it a good movie.  Meanwhile, you should pass this one by.

B005BGBPBG|3.0|Saying that this movie is \\"just okay\\" may even be too nice of a rating. There were moments that I enjoyed, identified with even, but overall the plot was cliched and the characters underdeveloped. I paid $3.99 to watch it instantly but it definitely wasn't worth that. If you really are dying to see it, get it through Redbox.
B001UV4XI8|2.0|Blue ray aspect of the DVD/Blue ray Harry Potter Deathly Hallows part 1 had issues and acts like its scratched skipping etc.  but no scratch appears to be there. Disappointed as I know the Blue ray aspect of my player works with all my other blue rays.  This is the 3rd time I have ordered a blue ray from Amazon with problems.
0307716511|3.0|This is one of these  books that when I was half way through I HIGHLY recomended it to both my mum and my sister and then when I was getting near the end I wished I hadn't \\"HIGHLY ED\\" it so much. Good book but a kinda crappy mixed up ending. (and before anybody says I didn't understand it....I did every last wee nuance, but I still thought it was a bit too contrived.)
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I love this movie and I consider it one of the funniest films ever made. And it didn't have all the usual trash that eminates from Hollywood these days which was like a breath of fresh air. 5 stars for Napoleon. :^)
B000066C6Z|5.0|My wife and I watch many mysteries.  As \\"palate cleansers\\" we watch comedies.  That is why we finally purchased Top Secret, even though it has been available for years.  It is still hilarious.  My wife had never seen the entire movie.  She could not stop laughing.  And of course the music is funny... and good.  We love Elvis movies (OK, a few of them), Beach Boys music, 50s & 60s music, and James Bond movies.  So how could this miss?!  If you're someone who hasn't heard of the movie, it may be considered a smaller budget, Austin Powers type movie.  Oh, did I mention the sight gags?  Groaners all, which made them even more funny.  So there.
B0000CEB4V|4.0|Video & audio very good.  Didn't care for the Indian thing but you can choose \\"George's music\\".  Monty Python skits were boring.  The George's music part was very good though.

B005CMSDLE|5.0|If you've read most of these reviews, you'll get the idea that you will either really like, or not like, Hanna.  I think it depends upon what you are looking for from cinema.    There are times when I simply want to be immersed in the sounds and the light and the dark...and have the opportunity to see a great young actress.  For me it wasn't about the destination, but it was all about the ride.  And I wish it never ended.  Unlike others who have written here, I could have been happy sitting and watching another 2 hours.    Hanna has the grit and industrial look of the old (REAL) Nikita TV series (not the crappy new one).  The soundtrack by the Chemical Brothers fits like a glove.  If you like action, it has that, but I don't think that's the main sell feature.    Hanna creates a mood and a world.  If you like it, you will really like it.  Or, you may hate it.    I saw it twice in theaters and then went to Amazon to see when it would be released on DVD.  Just ordered it.  Can't wait.

0525951652|1.0|My wife and I have been fans of Follett since Eye of the Needle.  We have read most everything he has written including possibly my favorite novel of all time---Pillars of the Earth.  And now the Fall of Giants (maybe the title refers to Follett's decline??).  A shallow, insipid, trite book.  There is no realistic character development.  Unless you consider the uneducated coal miner who enters the British Army and becomes a strategy genius and leads a large British force out of danger.  Oh, and then he becomes a eloquent lawyer defending himself in a court martial.   Follett uses the book to re-write history to align with his support for the British Labour Party.  How about Trotsky being a \\"great man\\"!  Things worked out really well for the Soviet Union, didn't they?  Just think:  this is the first of a trilogy!!!  Forget about it!!
B001HBX8NC|5.0|This Rigoletto in scene one is set in the 16th century, thereafter in approximately the 1850's. I am all for that,but I thought the real traditionalists might be a bit up set. However, for once they are happy with the staging and opera over all. So they should be. Maestro Santi, a great opera conductor, who at time of recording this opera, must have been at least 76. His tempi are swift, always are. He conducts without the score.He brings out the pathos, passion and melodies in the score as if he were still a young man.Bravo. His interaction with the cast during the applause is something to behold.    Rigoletto,Leo Nucci, seems to be improving with age, his acting abilities are superb.Being an Italian, he brings authenticity to the part, as did the great Tito Gobbi.There is nothing like hearing opera with an Italian in the cast. It is like hearing flamenco sung by Andalucian gypsies, extremely authentic. Piotr Beczala after his debut in in Linz, Austria, joined the Zurich opera and has retained close links with the house,as that great singer, Jonas Kaufmann. Piotr's voice is well suited to the role of the Duke and is another star in the making. How lucky  we are today in having Tenors, Kaufmann, Calleja(see La Traviata-cond Pappano),Villazon and Beczala.  Elena Mosuc is a Zurich opera regular,and is a very sensitive Gilda.Her duets with Rigoletto and the Duke are very well sung and emotional. Sparafucile is Lazlo Polgar,another Zurich opera regular. In fine voice in the part.The Bluray picture is superb. Worldwide HD.     The staging of this Rigoletto is traditional minimalist which I like. I dislike Zeffirelli trash.Which is code for over the top cluttered staging which states\\"look at me. The Gramophone year book points this out in its 2009 version, when it reviews the Los Angelis version of La Traviata cond Conlon. The audience claps the scenery. It is over bearing. The singing is great with Fleming and Villazon, a dream team. I gave it away. I felt sick looking at the staging, the star of the show. How I hate that. Generally, I like traditional staging, as long as its staging is reasonable. I also like modern staged versions of opera as long as it makes sense to me.     I must draw your attention to the modern staged DVD Rigoletto conducted by Fabio Luisi,conducting the Dresden State orch. Stage Director Lehnhoff.  Damrau as Gilda, probably edges out Mosuc as Gilda,but only just. Florez voice is too light for the part of the Duke. He states he will not sing the part for a while.Obviously,Beczala is more effective in the part. Lucic is a lyrical Baritone and brings pathos to the part of Rigoletto. In the duet between Gilda and Rigoletto,Lucic and Damrau are slightly better then Mosuc and Nucci. Luisi conducts with swift tempi and brings that Italian feel to the music, as does Santi. This is merely a subjective opinion.If you are thinking of owning the Santi Bluray, do so. If you can afford it, also buy the Luisi. You then get two different approaches to a  great opera. Both are worldwide.     I must point out that although I give five stars to most of the operas and symphonic works I buy, it is because before I obtain them, I do a lot of research. I have only made two mistakes. I have been a fan of opera and symphonic works,for more years then I care to think about. I hope you enjoy this Rigoletto as much as I have
B003L77GG0|4.0|The tenth and final season of \\"Smallville\\" features some outstanding shows such as the premiere episode, \\"Lazarus\\" and the series' 200th episode, \\"Homecoming.\\" Of course the march to the finale kept fans tuning in week after week. I have watched the show for years and enjoyed it although I realized it was uneven at times and didn't always pay off. To me, the final show, \\"Finale\\" is a perfect example of this. A lot of season ten was spent on Clark and Lois Lane's relationship and plans for the wedding. The first hour of the finale focused on the wedding and then, guess what? No wedding! It may happen seven years from now! What??!! Then, we were teased with the Superman suit in the first episode and other shows including the next-to-last show. Did they pay that off? No, of course not! Welling never dons the suit. We get a CGI Superman flying and a rip of his shirt revealing the Superman logo for the final shot. Even an extreme close-up of Welling with a CGI cape billowing behind him. Again, what the heck??!! I really had faith that writers Brian Peterson and Kelly Souders would come through. Now I am left with a disappointment with the series due to the finale and Tom not flying with the suit on. The pay-offs were lacking. We did get a great scene of Jonathan handing the suit to Clark (for what good that did!) and a great shot of Clark flying out of the fortress and I liked the shot too when Lois saw him flying outside the plane. But I had hoped to smile when I think of the finale and I don't. I did like the scene when Jonathan and Martha and Clark all embrace in the barn as Apocalypse is heading toward earth. One can only hope that maybe a reunion movie will be made some day and Tom Welling, realizing how disappointed many fans were, will actually no longer fear to put the suit on. I will buy this season but with a mixed bag of emotions.
B0031RS2I6|4.0|I read the book several months back. I found it well written and amusing. However now I can barely recall the plot. That's why I gave it only 4 stars - evidently it hasn't left a lasting impression on me... It's the standard Wodehouse fare, which means expect wry, old-style \\"British\\" humor at its best.
1250004349|4.0|I am not going to go in great depth explaining the story because obviously many people have already done that and it's in the description. I will say that I have always been interested in history including the Holocaust. As the chapters move along it switches back from Sarah's point in 1942 to that of the view of Julia the American lady, who now lives in Paris and is investigating for an article she is writing. I found myself wanting to continue reading to find out Sarah's story but somewhat annoyed when it was Julia's turn.     The story was interesting and I enjoyed it as a whole, but the entire dilemma Julia is going through about her marriage and the possibility of a new child was exasperating. I felt most of the plot was too easy to fit together and the ending so obvious.     I do have to say this book inspired me to read further on the Holocaust and I am currently reading the autobiography titled: \\"A Lucky Child: A Memoir of Surviving Auschwitz as a Young Boy\\" by Thomas Buergenthal.
B00003CXXP|5.0|Hey everybody, I would like to say that this movie is incredible. Let me also add that this movie was Stanley Kubrick's last movie. Halfway through the filming of this, he passed away, and Steven Spielberg took over for him. Therefore, there should be two names on the list of directors.
B0055V0HXO|3.0|(Note : I really wanted to rate this 3 1/2 star as I think it's a bit better than just 3 stars)<br /><br />Being a huge fan of Karmakanic's \\"Who's the boss in the factory\\" - not to mention the Flower Kings and other swedish prog - I was very much looking forward to this album. While I wouldn't say that I was necessarily disappointed in \\"In a perfect world\\", I will say that I don't think it was on par with \\"Who's the Boss\\". I can't really point to any one thing I didn't care for on the album, but none of the songs really impressed me as being more than well written, but pretty straight forward modern prog in the same vein as Flower Kings.<br /><br />That being said, \\"Turn it up\\" is a strong effort that sounds like something that could break into radio rotation on quite a few stations. \\"Can't Take it with you\\" is also a lot of crunchy, macabre fun but in the end, there's just not enough on this album that sets it apart from many other albums just like it.<br /><br />Now, having said all that, I'm not sorry I bought the album, I have enjoyed listening to it and I don't think if you're a fan of their earlier stuff or just modern prog in general you'll regret buying this album if you decide to do so. However, if you're limited on funds (like most of us) then this album can probably wait for now.

0062060554|4.0|Unlike many other books, Before I Go To Sleep is easy to get into.  From the first pages I was hooked and couldn't put it down until I was finished, which only took a day.  I admit that it does get a bit wordy for my taste and I caught myself skimming paragraphs, also the ending was a bit of a let down in my opinion. That being said, I actually really enjoyed the book, the concept kept me interested, the writing was well done.  I would definitely recommended this book to others.
0470638842|5.0|I have to say, this is by far the best book out there about social media.  A thorough description and breakdown about how social media works and the future of it.  My only gripe with this book is that it doesn't explain exactly HOW to word things being posted, or how to include certain things in posts, and how to boost the number of likes and followers.  Regardless, this is an outstanding book and should be read by any interested in social media, or the future of everyday life.

B0002WZTOI|4.0|If you happen to check out most or all of the special features on this deluxe \\"special collector's edition\\" of TOP GUN, odds are strong that you will never EVER want to hear Kenny Loggins' \\"Danger Zone\\" again in your lifetime.  About the only features included that that tune isn't featured in the background are the videos for the other featured tunes (Berlin's \\"Take My Breath Away\\" and Lover Boy's \\"Heaven Is In Your Eyes\\").  I've always kinda of liked Kenny L., but the cumulative effect of hearing this  is mind numbing, something that in the eyes of many critics, can be said about the film itself.    But TOP GUN really is one of those critic-proof movies, for a lot of reasons.  It's hard to imagine a movie more emblematic of the 1980s America.  Politics are almost never mentiioned, of course.  Young viewers today will learn little about 1980s history or politics--and Ronald Reagan's name is never even mentioned.  But anti-Soviet sentiment bookends the movie, and there will be those viewers now who will find the symbolic defeat of the Russians at the film's end to be rather prophetic in its way.  I'll say this much, the filmmakers were clever enough to throw in a skirmish that led to fatalities but was subsequently hushed up by both sides.  That would be the only way such an exchange could have conceivably played out in the mid-'80s, at least the only way that would have not have brought us into Stranglove territory.    And that may be the only nod to the political and social realities of the era that you'll find in the entire movie.  Or maybe not.  If there's one thing struck me from the get go was the strutting and preening of nearly ALL the young pilots (their sidekicks and back-ups, the so-called RIOs, on the other hand, are allowed to be a little goofy and almost human).  Tom Cruise's character is nicknamed \\"Maverick,\\" so it's no surprise that he's a self-styled wild card.  His main competition and dramatic foil (Val Kilmer) has an equally apt moniker \\"Ice Man\\"whose piloting is less intuitive than \\"Mav's\\" but more controlled and disciplined.  Who wins the coveted number one spot at the Flight Academy?  Well, by this point in cinematic history, I guess I could be allowed a \\"spoiler\\" here, but actaully the important point is no matter how you slice it and no matter who gets the trophy, the showdown with the Soviets actually guarantees that actually EVERYBODY wins--and whether you're an \\"Ice Man\\" OR a \\"Maverick,\\" you can achieve true heroism in actual conflict.      Therein lies the formula.  And no, I don't think anyone involved with this project would deny that TOP GUN is formulaic.  In the accompanying documentary, there are some revelatory comments.  Co-producer Jerry Bruckheimer (I'm pretty sure it was) finds that at its core, TG is as much a \\"sports film\\" as a \\"military one.\\"  That's one of the reasons, we're told, the for the locker room scenes (the other, of course, being the opportunity for some beefcake shots).  The viewer is meant to make the connection between athletic prowess and military readiness and to see these pilots as not just masters of machinery but as dyed-in-wool sports heroes.      Director Tony Scott, on the other hand, is of the opinion that his flick is a kind of \\"rock'n'roll movie,\\" and there's certainly an argument for that assertion that goes beyond the soundtrack.  Well, if you consider that, by the 1980s, much of what constituted actual rock music (and embodied the \\"rock and roll spirit\\" for many) was actually pretty tame and corporate, a sort of controlled rebeliousness, as it were, then there's considerable truth to that sentiment.  Tom Cruise's Maverick is has something of a \\"rock'n'roll heart\\" and is certainly a loose cannon, but in the heat of a crisis moment, it turns out that this cannon's aim is nonetheless true.      And therein lie elements of classic American myth, in which the rugged individualist winds up serving the common good after all.  What could be more all-American than that?  And he gets the girl too (although in keeping with the spirit of the times,  she's actually a liberated, accmoplished military advisor herself, thank you very much).  Now pass the popcorn.
030788743X|5.0|This is going to be a hard review for me to do.  Mainly because I loved this book.  I loved it so much . . . I kind of want to marry it :-)  Seriously though,  this book had to have been written by a nerd.  I happen to like nerds.  I married one, and I happen to be one myself.  That being said, I don't think you have to be a hard-core video game loving geek to really enjoy Ready Player One.<br /><br />The hero of this story is Wade Watts, or as his OASIS avatar is known, Perzival.  I liked this book for many reasons, but this character is one of the biggest.  He is like a real person.  He does and thinks and feels the things you would really feel.  He's just like so many boys his age that live in our very own world.  I loved seeing how he evolved throughout the story from being unsure of himself socially to being a total kick-ass confident dude.<br /><br />I loved that the world was so much like our own.  I didn't think of it as science fiction really but more like a fictional glimpse into what our future could look like.  It is a totally believable and awesome premise.  The real world has gone to crap, and people pretty much live their lives in the OASIS.  The OASIS is a haven for people to escape their dull, depressing lives.<br /><br />If you are worried that you have to be well-versed in video games or technology to like this book, you don't!  I promise!  The story and characters alone are so good that you won't be able to put it down.  BUT, if you happen to be a video-game loving dork then I think this book will hold a special place in your heart.  I have to say I gave myself a pat on the back for getting the 'chaotic neutral' reference in one of the dialogue exchanges :-) Although I really have my husband to thank for that one since he's mainly responsible for all the geeky things I know and like!<br /><br />I just can't do this book justice, so you really have to read it for yourself.  I have been telling everyone how they have to read this book or I'll be mad at them forever.  Ready Player One jumped up into my top ten favorite books . . . and those are some lofty titles I have in there.  I don't dethrone books on that list for any old book that comes along :-)<br /><br />Read it!  You won't be disappointed.er One jumped up into my top ten favorite books . . . and those are some lofty titles I have in there.

0553801473|4.0|Had been waiting for years for this book to come out.  Enjoyed it, but not as much as the previous four.  Wanted to learn more about all of the prior charactors in this epic series.  Instead, much of the first half is spent introducing us to even more characters!  It therefore, took me some time to get engaged in the book.  But, by midpoint, could not put it down.  Enjoyed the usual cliffhanger ending but found myself feeling frustrated at having to wait another 2-5 years for the next one.
B0034G4ORC|5.0|Wow, for a full-on war movie, this was amazing! The acting was incredible - especially considering they had to pretend the entire time! From sound effects to the portrayal of potential war-like scenarios and emotional trauma that soldiers endure, I found this movie to be realistic and engaging. I was on the edge of my seat almost the entire movie... except when I teared up a couple of times. This movie got medium-poor reviews and I can't understand why.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|\\"Note that unlike Android tablets with operating systems older than 3.0 which allowed control orientation locks from inside the app reader, Android 3.0 tablets no longer offer this feature.\\"    What? Are you kidding me? I'm not about to go change my auto-orientation setting everytime I read a book and then change it again when I'm done reading. Obviously, this lock feature is technically possible from within an app, because other games as well as reader apps like Aldiko allow for it. Disappointing.
B004K4IZ54|5.0|There are certain movies that BluRay really makes a difference.  The most recent Tron is one of those.  While the story line provided excellent continuity from the first movie, the visuals provided an almost ballet-like rendering in light and contrast.  I recommend this movie in BluRay.
B003L20IHO|3.0|So this is about as 'deep' as Hollywood dares to go nowadays, especially when flaunting the acting chops of its 'beautiful', 'maturing' lead? I'd heard pretty decent things about this and it was....just ok. Seemed like a cross between ORDINARY PEOPLE and ALWAYS, or maybe a GHOST WHISPERER episode.  What really got me though: the annoyingly 'cockney' friend of Zac's who's sole purpose seemed to be to give the film some London shabby-chic of the Russell Brand variety. There was never any explanation why some kid from London was digging graves and care taking at some remote Maine or Northern California seaside village!! Maybe the book explains it. I'm just so sick of these English actors being cast for no good reason and then they amp up their 'accent' (real or not) to 1000 db above normal (I'm talking to you, Rachel Weisz!). And the end was SOOOOOOO predictable.
B000VKW7AK|4.0|This could have been the ultimate box set for a Megadeth fan, but for some reason someone decided to edit the 1992 Hammersmith video. The original release of this video had fourteen songs on it, but the concert is edited down to 10 songs for the Warchest box.<br />The original release setlist:<br /><br />Holy Wars...The punishment due<br />Skin O' my teeth*<br />Wake up dead<br />Hanger 18<br />Foreclosure of a dream*<br />Countdown to extinction*<br />Lucretia<br />Sweating bullets<br />In my darkest hour<br />Tornado of souls<br />Ashes in your mouth<br />Symphony of destruction*<br />Peace sells<br />Anarchy in the UK<br /><br />* are all cut from the show included in Warchest, which is unfortunate. This is the only official live video release with the Friedman/Menza line-up, so why butcher it? Other than that, this is an excellent box set. However, butchering the Hammersmith show costs it a star.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Ordering through Amazon was great as usual; shipping was really fast - Amazon Prime; there is no other way!    My first reaction to the movie was how visually spectacular it is.  The scenery, the costumes, everything is so lush and they seemed to have every detail in order.  It was a very well formed and skilled cast and a large one at that.  I must confess, I bought the movie after I saw Gerard Butler was the phantom, and I was very impressed with his performance.  I just couldn't pass up a chance to hear Leonidas singing. :)    I must say it was a bit slow going for me at first, beautiful, but slow.  But, in the end, I'm glad I made that journey with the characters.  A few times during this film I remember saying to myself, \\"Alright already, I get it!  Can we just move on please?\\"  Some of the scenes were a bit long, like the cemetery scene; I wanted Christine to get to where she was going already!  She had a very long song to sing!  And they must have repeated the line \\"The Angel of Music\\", referring to the phantom, at least 100 times throughout the movie, that got a bit old.      But, like I said, the long journey to the climax was worth every bit of patience.  At first, I was routing for the phantom; he had gone out of his way to coach this girl and wanted to make her a star.  So, when this rich boy comes along and only notices Christine after she has the lead role, the role the phantom helped her get, I was a bit skeptical of the boy.    But, when the phantom kills one of the stage crew, for no real reason, that's when my opinion of him started to change.  It broke my heart, though, when Christine was with the rich boy on the roof, telling him how ugly the phantom was and how she couldn't imagine a life with him.  At that point, I didn't think much of Christine, felt sorry for the phantom, and continued to dislike the rich boy.    It wasn't until the Masquerade scene that all those opinions changed.  Christine and the rich boy were secretly engaged and attend the ball together.  The scorned phantom makes an appearance and by that time, he was starting to appear as an obsessive stalker and I felt a little scared for Christine.  And the way the rich boy chases after him to provide some relief for his fiancé, I thought that was noble of him.    At one point, before Christine is about to star in the phantom's opera \\"Don Juan\\", I remember Christine telling her rich boy how frightened she was to lure the phantom into the trap they had set.  It was then that I had the revelation ~ why don't they just leave that freaking opera house?  There are other places and opera houses in the world without stalker phantoms in them... But I guess that wouldn't make much of a movie...  Anyways...    Oh, and the background story of how the phantom came to be in the opera house really helped me to understand the phantom so much more.  The horrible cruelty one had to suffer from being different back in those times.  It was truly sad.  Then the young ballerina teacher hides him in the opera house after he attacks his abuser, and he grows up getting to know everything about the opera house.  Um, and why didn't the ballerina teacher and the phantom ever hook up?    The climax was a great one; Christine betrays the phantom by pulling off his mask.  And let me just say wow at what was hidden under that mask.  Wow!  Before the big reveal, I never thought it could be that bad, I mean, the other half of his face was, well hot, and the mask seemed to cover so little!  I kept asking myself what is wrong with that Christine girl earlier in the movie; this is Gerard Butler were talking about!  But wow, when the mask is pulled off and all is revealed, it's hard to imagine the handsome face under that!  Well done make-up artists!    But I digress...  The scene back in the phantom's lair, when the phantom is overcome with possessive jealousy, forcing poor Christine to be at his side when her heart clearly belongs to the rich boy, it was heartbreaking.  Thephantom's slip into madness was an understandable, but scary change.  And when the phantom makes her choose a life with him or a world without her rich boy, it was tragic.  Realizing what he had become in the eyes of the woman he loved, the phantom relents and lets them go.  And when Christine goes to say her goodbye to the phantom, it makes for the saddest scene of the entire film for me.  He had so much love for her and when he broke down and reveals his true self, she just leaves.  She just leaves with her rich boy.  My goodness it was sad.    Great movie it is one I'm very happy to have as apart of my collection.  Well done to all the people involved with this film; it is truly great.

B004SUDPXW|2.0|What was that? We just finished the 3rd and final bluray of season 3 and cant believe how bad and diappointing this season was. We loved each single episode of the previous two but this is ridiculous... while some episodes are ok, most are not and some are total let-downs (The Fly? Get out of here...). And the final 'cliffhanger'...pu-lease!!! Not a happy camper and will approach next season with caution...
B003KUSUG8|4.0|I was happy with how fast it got here but it WAS NOT packaged vey well at all and when I got my cd the case was shattered. luckily it didnt scratch the cd but I had to get a new case for it cause the one it came in couldnt be used like i said it was shattered, but it came pretty quick and it was in new condition, it WASNT shink wrapped like I was told it wouyld be but the cd looked new it worked just fine and had NO scratches on it! thanks for the GREAT TUNAGE!!<br />  happy camper :)(for the most part)

0879306033|4.0|As one of the designers of the early ARP 2500, it was interesting to see a recap of those years at the company.   The book presents a fascinating panorama of the history and evolution of analog synths, and is a good study of what drives product success in the marketplace.   It is interesting to note how technology has disruptively moved from analog to digital, making synthesizer design into a completely different process from what it was in the good old days.
B001R0KH3M|4.0|I agree with the Gentleman about the picture quality. My Samsung Plasma also says this is not in 1080p, but 1080i resolution, but the DTS sound is fantastic. Sure there's crowd involvement, and Stevie's daughter sings a mediocre song, but over all, great stuff if you're a Stevie fan, we've waited for this forever!!! But they shouldn't say on the Box it's shot in only 1080p, because I don't know what kind of t.v. would say that. Mine's been pretty accurate in saying the true resolution of a Video, including 1080p 24fps on things like Avatar, and other Blu Ray's that are actually 1080p, but, it's still worth buying.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|I have only played the first few levels and already it&apos;s amazing! graphics and sounds are very retro, but have a smooth finish similar to hexdefense. love that it has more tower options and tunnels. also it&apos;s free on Amazon today so go get it! thanks Amazon!
B004EPZ070|1.0|Negatives:  (1.) Just in reading the liner notes on the back cover of the DVD without knowing a thing about the movie I knew it was going to be a white middle class professional love triangle centered in NY (and most likely, like all others of this genre, would have overhead shots of Central Park and of restaurants and bars and parties) and guess what? Demographics for this genre also marginally exist in LA and elsewhere of course but the inspiration can know only one source - the cloistered nor'easterner.   (2.) It was going to be another in a long line dating back to the '20s and put out every four years because human memory of blandness is short and so another chick flick (and a few guys I'm sure) NY centric romantic comedy survives to infect again.  (3.) More of the same misunderstood love triangle with the usual fourth unappreciated advisor type who is also a potential love interest (known only to the audience of course). Boring. So, is this yet another example of American creative decline?    Positive:  (1.) kate is creatively capable of a much more substantial role. (Shouldn't that be a negative you ask? NO, because she will learn from her mistake and also use the money for some great humanitarian greater good.)
B003Y5H5FG|4.0|When one takes a look at vampires in the media these days, it's a wonder any of them manage to stand out.  Considering how many stories feature romanticized bloodsuckers, or ones that sparkle in sunlight instead of turning to ash, it's such a delight to get a film that gives us charming, but exceedingly dangerous vampires who aren't afraid to seduce you and those you love before sinking their fangs into your flesh.    \\"Fright Night\\" follows the story of Charley, a typical teenager living out in Las Vegas with his mother.  Life is simple:  he goes to school, has geeky friends, and a nice girlfriend.  But when his classmates start disappearing, Charlie soon realizes that a man named Jerry, while charming and handsome, is actually a vampire who's out to suck as much blood as he can, and has set his sights on the people Charlie cares about most.  The only problem?  Jerry happens to be Charley's neighbor.    What makes \\"Fright Night\\" so effective is that it's an effective blend of horror and action.  While there's plenty of stabbings, shootings, and stuff getting thrown about, there's also some very effective horror moments:  Jerry is a charming and charismatic, but at the same time, he's different from other classic vampires in that while some of the traditional anti-vampire charms work, others don't, which lends the film a good sense of tense mystery, as we don't know what, if anything, will harm or kill Jerry.  And while the action and horror compliment each other really well, and carry the film from beginning to end, there is a nice dash of humor to be found in David Tennant's performance of Peter Vincent, a stage performer who's a great mix of charisma and over the top theatrics.    Overall, \\"Fright Night\\" is a refreshing take on the Vampire mythos:  With it's strong cast, effective blend of horror and action, and a touch of mystery, it makes for a surprisingly well done film, and a breath of fresh air in a genre that's been sucked dry by vampire overload.
B004LWZVZC|3.0|Negatives:  (1.) Just moved too slowly and outcome was never in doubt.   (2.) Miscast -  the individuals chosen for their respective roles seemed too Hollywoodish and were not believable.   (3.) Another museum movie in terms of everything from clothing to props to settings seemed too dust free and perfect in all respects as if you were touring a display at some historical museum. Detracts from feeling as if you're there and instead turns you into an audience spectator to some staged event. Even the language seemed too contemporarily staged.    Positives;  (1.) Learned a bit about the assassination.   (2.) The parallel to military trials held in the recent past (last 70 years) such as the Guantanamo tribunals was eerie.
B000V5SIFS|5.0|TNG has the Inner Light and this is clearly DS9's equal. Great story that does not show the ending. Powerful and Emotional, a drama story done Star Trek style. Excellent!!!   While I am a TOS and TNG fan I have to say I am enjoying watching DS9 and this is far and away the best episode of season one. I have heard it is also one of the best of the series as well.
B00425S1H8|4.0|Everything delivered just fine, price was great. Using it with some weather equipment. The windows 7 x64 may not be true as I kept getting corrupt data but it works on x32. I cannot confirm weather this is the cable, my equipment, or the software. The drivers on the site were easy to find and from when I shopped looked to be better supported and more up to date than anything near this price. Build is sturdy and it works fine in 32-bit Windows 7 which was what it had to do in the end.

1463514581|5.0|I loved this book! Devoured it as quickly as possible. When 24-year-old Rose Gardner gets drawn into a series of unlikely -- and increasingly dangerous -- circumstances in her small town of Henryetta, she jumps at the chance to create a new life for herself. Having lived her whole life under the thumb of a domineering mother, Rose has never played in the rain, danced, eaten Chinese food, or kissed a man. Now she's doing everything she's never had the guts to do befor -- but will she be able to solve the mystery of her mother's murder and the mysterious, handsome new neighbor across the street before she ends up dead, too?    Rose's voice is personable, spunky, and honest, and her transformation from a bullied daughter to a confident, hopeful young woman is truly enjoyable to behold! With a cast of endearing characters, a slew of unexpected twists, a suitably simmering romance, and an authentic Southern flavor, fans of romance, mystery, and Southern fiction will find much to love in TWENTY-EIGHT AND A HALF WISHES! I'll definitely be looking out for more from this author. :)

1451629184|5.0|This was a good book to read and finally put to rest what Jaycee went through, as so many of us were so curious.  she wrote it well and explained so much it left my heart breaking for her.  My wish is that a child would be saved  by realizing how easily one can be snatched up.    Also, Jaycee wants to have a best seller and I think we should buy her book at least for that reason even if you  don't want to read her story.
B003A4IFDW|3.0|Each of these rock classics becomes a LaVette original on this album. Some are almost unrecognizable when compared to the originals. If you like 60s R&B and approach this album with an open mind, you'll find it very well done. For example, LaVette's is the only version of \\"Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood\\" I've ever been able to listen to. \\"Love Rein O're Me\\" is breathtaking. Others, not so much.
0316044938|1.0|I never understood the hype behind this book.<br /><br />It's just bad.  Plain and simple.  I imagine that many of the same people who thought this book was amazing are the same people who are currently gushing over 50 Shades of Grey.  With that in mind, if you are sitting there wondering to yourself \\"What's wrong with 50 Shades of Grey?  I mean, I like Lovely Bones AND 50 Shades of Grey, I thought they were both pretty good\\" then I guess there is just no talking to you at all whatsoever<br /><br />I think that people gave it such good reviews because the book is based off of the author's own experience with rape, and with that, there is a fascination with depressing literature (for some reason).  But that does not make the book good.  It was poorly written.  There is such a thing as too much symbolism (cheap symbolism at that), and this book is it.<br /><br />For example--the number 5.  I specifically remember seeing the use of the number 5, and thinking \\"Oh please, let me guess..... the number 5 is a symbol of some sort....\\"  This pretty much sums up my reaction to every other symbol in the book.  Here's the thing--the reader isn't SUPPOSED to anticipate symbolism.  The symbol is supposed to blend in with the story enough so that the reader figures it out as the story pulls itself together.  The reader is not supposed to be sitting there like \\"Hmmm I think this is a symbol, and I'll probably see it again later in the book.\\"  That is the sign of a bad author.<br /><br />And they found an... elbow?  Does anyone else find this kind of strange?  An elbow?  Really?  Really.  Of all the body parts... just a little odd, is all.<br /><br />The portrayal of heaven is utterly depressing.  And with that, if you were dead, went to heaven, and then given a limited time to go back to earth, do you mean to tell me that you would rather sleep with your middle school crush, and THEN try and get in contact with your family just as your time is running up?  What is wrong with you people.  Get your priorities in line.<br /><br />Perhaps it's the fascination with reading about a victim.  Perhaps it's just a bunch of young people who confuse \\"intriguing\\" with \\"whimsical and crappy.\\"  Perhaps it's the gradient on the cover that screams \\"Hey, if I look this cool, I must BE cool.\\"  Otherwise, the hype just doesn't make sense at all.  The book is horrible.

B004G6009K|5.0|I first watched this movie with my kids in just plain 2D, and loved the story and thought it was great.  When it came out in 3D BluRay, I just had to get it for the kids, and well the parents too...    The depth of the story in 3D is just phenomenal!  We use Passive 3D (Vizio's new Cinema3D technology) which allows us to use the same 3D glasses you use in the theater, much cheaper.  And I can't tell a difference in the display of 3D content, except it is not as dark looking as the Active 3D.    Back to the movie.  It is excellent and if you have 3D, pay the extra for the 3D experience in this movie.  It is like watching it come to life in the living room.  The kids love the lantern scene where the lanterns seem to float into the room and the action is great as well.  I personally find the depth of the picture so much deeper and it really pulls me into the scene.  I just wish I had a larger screen... Someday!    Love the movie.
0307454541|4.0|At first, I was unsure as to whether or not I would abandon this novel due to the overwhelming amount of peripheral details.  In fact, I was not solidly hooked until about page 300.  After this, however, the quest to find Harriet left me riveted and excited to read on.  While I still find Larsson sometimes leaves the reader mudddled in facts, the overall intrigue and fascinating charcter development ultimately led me to rating this with four stars.  It is most defintiely a book worth reading-one that is truly captivating!
B00005N6KG|5.0|I use these for working out. I'm not looking for the best sound quality and given that my workout headphones are likely to be subjected to all kinds of weather and sweat I want something that is easily replaced.    Comfort: over the head headphones are by far the best for running or working out in general. Other phones fall out of my ears, even if they come with different rubber size gaskets. These don't for the simple fact that the band goes over your head. Also, they do not hurt my hears at all.    Easy of use: Yep they work. Plug them in and go. Also, as I mentioned above, I don't have to constantly push them back into my ears as I might with buds.    Sound quality: I have a more expensive pair that I use at work. They sounds quite a bit better than these. However, these provide great quality for the price. Also, I'm willing to sacrifice in this particular area. That said, these actually don't sound tinny like most headphones.    Ruggedness/durability: I've probably bought three of these in like 10 years. My previous pair bit the dust when I stepped on the free-hanging cord and then stood up. Ripped the cable right out of the bottom. Mostly my fault as few headphones would survive that. My other pair gave up the ghost from what I presume was too much moisture. One of the drivers simply stopped working. I can see where these would be easy to break in other ways, but given the price, who cares? They're rugged enough and you'll easily get your moneys worth before you break them.
B003Y5H5FG|5.0|Okay, I am a HUGE Fright Night fan.  I even enjoyed Fright Night part II, despite it's weak spots(less threatening and interesting villains, semi-rehash plot line).  The original Fright Night has all the things I love about that special time called the 80's in horror; boisterous special effects, tongue firmly in cheek, monsters, and really great make up effects and ever evolving visual effects.  It was a love letter to Hammer vampires and a send up of the 80's slasher trend that dominated the era and knocked over the traditional monsters.  I had heard about this remake several years ago and was aghast.  Nobody wanted Hollyweird to stay away from Fright Night more than me.  I was so shocked that the remake turned out to be not only good, but surprising, and totally fun.<br /><br />Now I know some horror fans, fanboys in general really, automatically hate something when it's remade, and hate something when the remake changes or rearranges things from the original.  Let me warn you purists nerds out there right now, this thing changes all the characters around with the exception of 'Evil' Ed Thompson.  He's the same, and played quirkily by Christopher Mintz Plasse(Mc'Lovin).  Jerry Dandridge is no longer a semi-tragic seducer, but a cold predator with motives only a supernatural predator could understand, but the movie is goodly enough to let us in anyway.  Peter Vincent(the biggest change in character in the remake) is no longer an older, washed up, Hammer-esque horror movie star with a cheap late night horror show, but now a Chris Angel inspired Vegas magician whose show revolves around the occult and especially gothic vampire imagery.  Charley Brewster is no longer the nerd next store, but rather a reformed nerd who is a status seeker, trying desperately to hide his old nerd ways to his new 'cool' friends, and super hot girlfriend Amy.  Amy is still the most thankless role, but she gets a bit of fleshing out before the third act and truly comes off sympathetic.<br /><br />Now, like the Halloween remakes, I'm sure most will be upset by the revamped Peter Vincent, but I quite enjoyed the concept and David Tennant's performance.  He's crude, drunk, and hiding some secrets from Charlie that the film will reveal.  They did a good job of connecting Vincent to the main vampire plot this time out.  One of the weaker spots of the original film was the logic behind Charlie going to a known actor for help killing a vampire.  It never made a whole lot of sense, but it was fun anyway.  In this version there's some logic there and a brilliantly over the top set piece that takes place in Vincent's Apartment in Vegas.<br /><br />In the original film Charlie Brewster was your basic straight man.  He had to play the auidience and the stalwart hero to root for.  The cool bit about this character in the original is that writer/director Tom Holland made him a horror hip nerd(long before Scream's Randy).  In the remake we find that Charlie is ashamed of his nerd past and he is seeking cool status in high school.  He's not very likeable at the out set.  His old nerd best friend Evil Ed informs him that one of their old chums has gone missing and possibly murdered, and Charlie just wants to hear none of it and be left alone.  You're not rooting for Charlie.  That's until he makes his first selfless act for a stripper neighbor entangled in a Jerry Dandridge trap.  Charlie has a full blow arch in this film.  I really enjoyed them taking the vanilla out of the vanilla hero in this remake.<br /><br />Oh, Jerry, my favorite vampire of the 80's this side of David Bowie and Kiefer Sutherland.  In the original Chris Sarandon's performance is brilliant and as written the character is better than the one presented here.  That's just a fact.  Jerry in the original seems tragic, but willing to do what he has to do to survive and to keep his secret.  This may seem like sacrilege to most fans but I was never a fan of the plot point in the original of Charlie's girlfriend Amy being the reincarnation of Jerry's long lost love.  It's too contrived and convenient and really unnecessary to the story at the end of the film.  Amy gets used basically as the bait for Charlie and Peter to come after Jerry into his trap.  In this film Jerry is pure predator.  Now one must understand why this was done.  In my opinion this film was not competing with the original portrayal of Jerry, but rather all the recent tragic, weepy, romantic vampires that have come along from True Blood, Vampire Diaries and most especially Twilight.  The writer of this film Marti Noxon(staff writer for Buffy the Vampire Slayer the series for years) was trying to create the ultimate anti-Twilight vampire in all his rated R glory. Colin Farrell is an excellent choice for this and his performance manages to be unshowy but rather subverssive.  He has a great scene where he threatens Charlie in between the lines after Ed goes missing(which unlike the original film is in the first 15 minutes so that doesn't count as a spoiler).  He's truly menacing and perfect for this role.  Plus, as a bonus original film's Jerry(Chris Sarandon) shows up for a funny cameo that had me cheering when I recognized his face.<br /><br />Anton Yelchin is a young actor I feel should be looked for.  This is his second starring role after Charlie Bartlet and he manages to earn our sympathy and complete a delicate arch from douche bag to hero.  He's quite good and look forward to him, and people who aren't generically good looking, in the youth crowd of actors getting more leads like this in bigger and better projects.  He manages to give us the pathos, comedy, and shear fear that this role requires, and sometimes in the same scene.  \\"See look, creepy vampire hand!\\", is one of his funniest lines and silliest and he manages it without looking or sounding stupid.<br /><br />Imogen Poots his quite effective in the film too, despite her having the most underwritten role.  She comes off not like a bimbo but as an average teenage girl, who just happens to be impossibly gorgeous.  I would like to see her in meatier roles with more to do beyond being the hero's reason for going into the dragon's lair after being kidnapped.<br /><br />Now onto Evil Ed, the most popular character from the first film.  Now Stephen Geoffreys isn't a great actor, but he imbued that part with something totally original and unexpected of the genre at the time.  I take nothing from his role in that film.  He was great.  Hell, the concept of a painfully nerdy kid becoming a new all powerful vampire is still a great quirky concept that no one has really done since or before.  In this we get Mintz-Plasse playing basically a toned down version of McLovin.  But it's more than that.  He manages to play the hurt of losing his best friend to the status of high school realistically, and his ultimate revenge manages to be harrowing, funny, and silly all in great effect.  Is he as memorable as Geoffreys in the original?  No, not even close, but he pulls off the roles requirements and I'd imagine for people who haven't seen the original, or don't even know that this is a remake, his character will hold some surprises for them.  The only thing I really want to complain about when it comes to this character and his role in the plot involves his demise by Jerry.  I don't mind that it happens WAAAAAY earlier in this film, but rather how the drama plays out.  In the original it's quite emotional how Jerry pulls Ed into his arms promising a world where no one will ever pick on him again, and quite scary how Jerry chases him in the alley.  In this film, while Jerry' dialogue is similar, it just doesn't have the same impact and pathos.  It's there but not quite as good.<br /><br />Toni Collette shows up in the film as Charlie's mom.  Her part has been beefed up from the previous film.  I really liked her and her role as the stakes for Charlie gets raised.  People accuse roles like this being thankless when big name and very talented actors like Colette take them, but I disagree.  She performs a function and does it really well.  Is the part small, and not very deep?  Yup, but it feels layered and you care about her almost instantly because of Colette.  Here's a good litmus test, if a lesser actress had played the 'thankless' role of Mrs. Brewster how would the film have turned out?  This isn't Shakespeare but it should be take seriously regardless and the final film benefits from it in totality.<br /><br />Now there is one thing that disappointed me about this remake; the vampires don't really have monster transformations.  In the original film Steve Johnson's make up effects for the vampires various monsterous visages were quite impressive if totally over done by the decade's end.  Jerry turns into a monsterous bat, Ed turns into a wolf, etc.  In this film the vampires do get ugly when they get mad, but it's just a slight bat-like visage and some major gnarly claws.  It was done by Howard Berger of KNB effects and the make ups are quite good, but they are enhanced with digial effects, very good digital effects by the way.  When Jerry goes full blown monster for the closing moments of the film it is mostly CGI.  Sorry, guys, but for some reason when Amy's jaw grows large and filled with jagged teeth in the original it was done well by make up effects, but the remake need to be aided by CGI.  Why?  Is it more effective?  Not really.  At the end of the day, digital or make up, I still know I'm looking at an effect.  I just admire make up effects more than CGI.  That's just me.<br /><br />The basic plot points and reasons for this story are the same as the original but tweaked, rearranged and give different back stories.  This is what I think remakes should do.  Make a good films for the virgins of the franchise but also surprise, hopefully pleasantly, the old fans.  This film does that in spades.  I can't really reveal what those tweaks and twists that might surprise old school fans are due to them being major spoilers.  I will say, without too much detail, that Jerry's ultimate plan has more to do with than just drinking blood for survival.  It's a great twist to the vampire lore, and leaves room for a third act surprise that had me squirming and widening my eyes with glee.  Peter Vincent gets the same treatment, although his new twist is easily figured out, at least to me, but it was very satisfying and gave him a logic of more dramatic weight that the first film really didn't need or have.  It works.<br /><br />I know my horror nerd membership card may get revoked, but I really loved this remake.  No, not more than the original, but as close to it as possible for a story I've seen once told already.  This is how remakes should be done in my estimation.  Don't recreate the wheel, but rather tweak it and turn it down a different road to get to the same end.  See this movie, new or old fan, you are going to get something out of it.  If you're a fanboy and just can't deal with anything about your original film being changed or tweaked, just avoid it and save yourself the headache and us your bitching rants.<br /><br />PS: I saw this is in 2D.  I really don't care about 3D and the low box office returns for 3D films is diminishing(just like it did in the 50's and in the 80') its appeal to studios, so I imagine I will have to deal with having to go to different theaters just to see a damn movie in glorious 2D much less in the future.  It's a horror film, set mostly at night, mostly in dark areas, so why would one want to make it muddier and darker by slipping on 3D glasses?  I wouldn't and don't.  Although, this film does have actual 3D intended shots, and was shot in actual 3D, I just didn't see the point of the gimmick beyond taking the audience out of the film which was a semi-serious horror film.  Plus, some of the shots that are big 3D shots really screw up the flow of the edit and manage to take you out of the movie even if you're watching it in 2D.  One that sticks out is a shot of a vampire monster hand coming through the bottom of a car.  The shot is held to long obviously for 3D effect.

B00005JA2B|5.0|Kansas is a great band. In my opinion, they are the best band. Leftoverture is their 4rth album and probably is their best album. Leftoverture has one of their biggest hits, \\"Carry On Wayward Son\\", but all songs on Leftovereture are great. There aren't that many albums out there that I have really liked every single song on the album. Leftoverture is one of those albums.    I highly recommend getting this album. I would also recommend getting Kansas's third album \\"Masque\\". \\"Masque\\" and \\"Leftoverture\\" are the albums to get.
0385523912|5.0|Those of us who lived in Communist countries easily recognize that Orwell's 1984 was on target in describing existence inside those totalitarian countries, particularly the all-encompasing paranoia (unfortunately, many technology-obsessed Canadians, Americans and Western Europeans only think of the telescreens in the book to be worried about). Mao's China, East Germany thorughout its existence, Stalin and Lenin's Russia, the early decades of Cuba were all characterized by this state of affairs. Later on, China, Soviet Union and China, although retaining their authoritarian character, over time shed the hysterical paranoia. North Korea, however, has retained its 1984 flavor. At the end of the book, the authoress mentions that there are tourist agencies promoting visits to North Korea \\"while it still lasts.\\" Kind of macabre.    And speaking of macabre . . . .    There are two ways to write about history. One is the traditional manner of writing about the goings on of the people in charge, be it a general, a king, the aristocracy, politicians, diplomats, etc. A relatively recent style of history has been writing about the common people in a particularly unusual envorionment (auschwitz, the gulag, the depression, civil wars, international wars, famines, etc.). This book is the latter. It chronicles the breakdown of everyday existence, or subsistence, of N. Korean families when the Soviet Union rid itself of its \\"fraternal\\" parasitical Marxist countries. A total breakdown occurred in the society and people in desperation tried to survive as best they could, sometimes doing shameful things in order to avoid starvation for themselves or their families (although it sounds like the book would be depressing to read, it actually avoids that). It reads like a novel and I found it hard to put down in order to do the things I needed to do in the day, as I wondered what would happen to the people that the authoress was writing about. Although the book is a compilation of testimonyof the survivors of the famine, the narrative is supplemented by information gathered by various documents from the UN, South Korea, Switzerland, America.    There is one tiny tidbit that was ommitted in the book which was disappointing because I have been trying to remember the name of a Westerner who travelled to N. Korea and documented the mass starvation and the deaths of thousands of children in that country due to starvation. He was shocked, when he returned to Europe and America and gave his presentation, that so many leftists/liberals either condemned him or ignored him. They were offended that he was criticizing a Communist regime. Communism = the opium of the intellectual.

159514188X|3.0|Since everyone has praised the book, I'll mention two main shortcomings. It does not appear to me that the narrator learned everything he could have from the tapes. He also should've turned in the two criminals (one much worse than the other, obviously) to the police.<br /><br />(spoiler follows)<br /><br />I think it was the fault of the author to try to alleviate guilt on behalf of Clay and his acquaintance (they guy who lent Hannah the tape recorder). They keep stating at the end that they couldn't have changed her mind; they couldn't possibly known that, and it was likely not true anyway. Clay also took the wrong lesson from the bedroom episode in the party. He shouldn't have stayed once the girl had told him to leave. The real problem was that there was no sober, responsible adult at the party who could have taken care of Hannah.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|I enjoyed this movie from start to finish because I love graphics. [[ASIN:B001OQCV2E 2012]] had some astonishing visual scenes that were mind-boggling and out-of-this-world cinematography. The plot wasn't unique, but the characters were and I rooted for them all the way.<br /><br />This movie was tongue-in-cheek believable because of the twists and turns woven into the story as John Cusack, a divorced author, tries to save his family.<br /><br />The year is 2012 and it's Cusack's time with the kids, so he takes them to Yellowstone National Park  where he and his wife had visited years before. He and the children run across a chained-in area, so climb the fence and discover a dead animal beside a dried-up lake. Soldiers suddenly appear and start to take them into custody when a scientist interferes. He lets them go with a fictional explanation and a warning to keep away.<br /><br />En route from the park, they meet Woody Harrelson who plays a crazy but knowledgeable conspiracy theorist who explains that it's the end of the world and the earth's core is deteriorating. They think he's kooky when he says he's staying on \\"the mountain\\" to watch the fireworks. Harrelson is marvelous in this role; a real natural.<br /><br />They're isolated when the earth starts to fall apart, exactly as some scientists had predicted two years previously. The government made secret plans to save some of the population, mostly politicians, but didn't put it into effect until almost too late. The earth's crust is already cracking all around the world, even as Cusack heads out of the park with his children.<br /><br />The children are back home with his ex-wife and her boyfriend by the time Cusack realizes the seriousness of the situation. Meanwhile, back in Washington, the President, played by Danny Glover, and his chief scientist are having a battle with his advisors about the President's desire to inform the public about the coming disaster.<br /><br />I've never seen such a mad, dramatic, picturesque dash to get back to save his family than when Cusack drives a car with buildings collapsing all around him, huge vehicles dropping in front of him, houses swallowed by the ground. Awesome scenes...<br /><br />And that's just the beginning of the destruction: the Washington monument crumbles and falls, the Eiffel Tower goes down, the Basilica in Rome is completely destroyed, and similar scenes occur all around the world. The only safe place at that point is in the air, it seems, and places where devastation has not yet reached. I was flabbergasted by the scenes when Cusack finally gets his family to a plane and they manage to take off: below them the earth appears to be devouring itself with trees sucked down, mountains toppling and the water over the ocean rising and receding with hurricane force, even reaching as high as the plane. Frightening, yet eerily beautiful to watch.<br /><br />Sure, Cusack and his family are barely missed by falling debris, narrowly escaping large sink-holes and fire-balls over and over again; too many times to be believable. But that's what makes it so exciting! Anyway, it's only a movie and I was rooting so hard for that little family, at that point I believed because I wanted to believe.<br /><br />John Cusack delivers a truly believable acting job...as does Glover, Amanda Peet, the kids and all the cast. I cared so much for them and some others in the cast that I was emotionally involved; I related to them.<br /><br />That's why I find it so hard to believe how many low marks this movie received from Amazon reviewers. To me it's a blockbuster and should receive acting and graphic awards.<br /><br />One reviewer called this movie \\"silly,\\" but I totally disagree. My hat's off to the actors, writers, the special effects people, the producers, the editor, director and everyone involved. I repeat: love this movie.<br /><br />Reviewed by Betty Dravis, August 21, 2011<br />Author of \\"Dream Reachers\\" books (with Chase Von) and other bookser books

B004LWZW4M|4.0|*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br /><br />At heart, every permutation of the \\"Planet of the Apes\\" franchise has been a searing denouncement of humanity and its numerous vices, especially basic stupidity. However, \\"Rise of the Planet of the Apes\\" (hereafter \\"Rise\\")catapults human idiocy to near-stratospheric levels. Roger Ebert writes in his \\"Rise\\" review, \\"..the movie has its pleasures, although human intelligence is not one of them.\\" The simian ascension will be a cakewalk. Consider the examples of human stupidity throughout the movie:<br /><br />1. Gen-Sys, the corporation for which the human protagonist Will Rodman (James Franco) works as a pharmaceutical scientist, boasts appalling security and ethical lapses. Of course, the first transgression involves Caesar's chimpanzee mother, Bright Eyes, who has received an infusion of the mind-enhancing drug, AZ-112.<br /><br />Not only does Gen-Sys lack the facilities to avert her subsequent rampage of destruction, it isn't even aware that she gave birth to Caesar and that her maternal protective instincts triggered her rage.<br /><br />2. Will's well-intentioned but ill-advised benevolence compels him to save the infant Caesar from his mother's fate. He decides to raise Caesar at home like a human child. Bad move. Introducing a potentially wild and destructive beast into a suburban neighborhood, including a chimpanzee, even a gifted one like Caesar is asking for trouble. Remember the story of the woman whose face was mutilated by a neighbor's \\"pet\\" chimpanzee and who required years of reconstructive surgery? Inevitably, Caesar intervenes between Will's Alzheimers-afflicted father Charles Rodman (John Lithgow) and an irate neighbor to protect the former, injures the latter, and is condemned to live at a brutal ape sanctuary in San Francisco.<br /><br />3. Will's love interest, primatologist Caroline Aranha (Freida Pinto) could have provided valuable insights into chimpanzee behavior, intellect, and motivations, and perhaps could have helped avert the climactic \\"ape escape\\". But instead of acting like Jane Goodall, Caroline merely makes vague pronouncements about how dangerous \\"cute\\" chimps really are and how we really shouldn't mess with them, and with genetic science in general. She turns out to be distracting eye candy.<br /><br />4. Again, good-intentioned but ethically-challenged Will absconds with some of the AZ-112 formula from his security- challenged company to inject into his father to re-enhance his cognitive abilities. It works, but only temporarily.<br /><br />5. Meanwhile, the imprisoned Caesar has to endure yet another shabbily maintained and guarded facility, an ape enclosure managed by two louts, the clueless proprietor John Landon (Brian Cox) and his son, abusive animal wrangler Dodge Landon (Tom Felton), plus a third individual.<br /><br />6. Why are there seemingly only three people managing a vast wildlife preserve containing (improbably) hundreds of chimpanzees, orangutans, and gorillas? Even without his AZ-enhanced genius, Caesar, I think, would not have had too much difficulty escaping from that minimum-security dump?<br /><br />7. Will manages to synthesize a more permanent, powerful version of AZ-112 (AZ-113, naturally) and attempts to test it on another chimpanzee. Lax security strikes again, the ape writhes on the table, a side-effect virus spreads to one of the handlers present (who has lost his sterilizing mask), and the guy later goes out into public without any decontamination procedures to bleed, sneeze, and spread the virus. Just great.<br /><br />8. Clever Caesar escapes, finds his way back to Will's house, obtains some AZ-113, which Will has again appropriated from his sieve of a company, and uses it to \\"brain-boost\\" his fellow simian inmates, and engineers a jail break.<br /><br />9. Foolishly, the vicious, taser-wielding Dodge allows Caesar to electrocute him with water from a hose.<br /><br />10. Roughly two hundred escaped apes, ledby Caesar, romp through San Francisco towards escape over the Golden Gate Bridge. A few cops on horseback with machine guns (and horrible aim) and a couple of helicopters is the best defense the city can muster? Where's the freaking National Guard? No wonder the apes have a relatively easy time making it to the Muir redwoods sanctuary.<br /><br />11. In the movie postscript, the AZ-113 virus (which humans are susceptible to but to which apes are immune) is spread by an airline pilot and becomes an epidemic.<br /><br />12. Thanks, Will. Your good intentions have paved a road to a hell of tort and criminal liability, not to mention the probable extinction of the human race and the subsequent ape ascendancy. At least the dinosaurs had the (arguable) excuse of an asteroid for their superseding by the mammals. And dinosaurs are supposed to be dumb?<br /><br />And yet, despite this relentless parade of dumbness, I really did enjoy the movie. The simian protagonist Caesar (motion-capture animated by Andy Serkis) is mainly responsible. His resourceful intellect, his \\"Frankenstein monster\\" plight, his sufferings, his clemency and his organization of an eventual worldwide revolution is well-paced and gripping. The movie's creators want you to be in his corner and you are. If that involves stacking the deck against humans, well so be it. Humans have had their day. Let the apes have a crack at it. In the next sequels, let's see how they do.<br /><br />P.S. During the movie, an expedition to Mars is lost in space. It is called Icarus. How apt. In mythology, Icarus flew too close to the sun on wax wings, had them melt, and fell to earth. If and when the Icarus crew falls back to earth, what bizarre reception can they expect?horseback with machine guns (and horrible aim) and a couple of helicopters is the best defense the city can muster?

He's got a few cool \\"radio hits\\" but like some other bands, his weaker stuff made it to the radio (just saying there's some juicy nuggets that never got airplay). After seeing a different PG concert on cable, I purchased three of his live DVD's and I'm really glad I did. I lost my first copy of this DVD and immediately purchased a replacement. PG seems to staff his band with only the finest players available. I have not one single complaint... Buy this DVD, you too will be glad you did!
1451629184|5.0|I read \\"A Stolen life: A Memoir\\" by Jacee Lee Dugard. I thought it was an excellent book. It was very sad and hard to read. My heart goes out to her and her family.
B002C6K7N0|4.0|As a point of reference, I am a late bloomer as far as becoming a Megadeth fan. My interest in Dave and his work has only become something beyond passive in the last 15 years or so. That is, in part, because of his personal story. I orignally liked Countdown to Extinction and have since grown to enjoy some of the albums since then. I especially like United Abominations. I have even begun to appreciate some of his pre-Countdown albums, including Rust in Peace.    That brings me to Endgame. This album has been a \\"head scratcher\\" for me since I bought it. Technically speaking, this album is probably as good as any in Megadeth's long history. There are some serious speed metal riffs intermixed with some exceptional guitar soloing by both Dave and his current band mate. The opening instrumental, Dielectric Chaos, is a great piece! In fact, as of right now, I would consider it the best on the album.    Endgame still has some very interesting lyrical subject matter consistent with Dave's usual approach to song-writing. I like the bit of politicized storytelling of \\"44 minutes\\" and enjoy the nearly pure joy (if you can ever really use that word for a Megadeth song) he describes of drag racing in \\"1340 degrees\\". The title track continues Dave's current trend of end-times focusssed music, which he seems to do very well. The songs, on average, seem to maintain that melodic direction he began to emphasize more beginning with Countdown. Still, I find my self struggling to do more that just warm to this album.    In part, I believe that is because of the production. Unlike UA or Countdown (at least the remixed version - the only one to own!), the vocals on this album are not as prominant and are, therefore, more difficult to decifer. The overall mix is fine, but not exceptional.     The other part of this is that this album does not feel \\"new\\" to me. Rather, it feels like a blending, or rehashing, of UA and Rust in Piece mixed into one album. Usually, when an established artist does that, it tends to result in something new or different. However, I don't get that from Endgame. Rather, it just feels familiar. Not a bad thing by any means. However, not the next great step either.    Bottom line: a must for all current Megadeth fans. For those of you that go way back, you will likely find this more to your liking than anything he/they have done since Countdown. For those that are more into the direction of Youthanasia and such, you may find this one alittle more difficult to digest. In the end, still worth it. For my taste, this is a \\"comfortable album\\" (although I guess I will never understand Dave's fasination for writing songs like \\"Head Crusher\\") relative to their other work - well worth routine play, but does not fall in as a \\"best\\".
B000000WA4|5.0|I cannot begin to explain how much I love this album.  It is truly a work of art.  I had listened to a couple of the songs off of this album and enjoyed them, though I found myself not liking most of them.  I took a chance and bought this album for the sole purpose of getting \\"1979\\" and \\"Tonight, Tonight.\\"  I know that it sounds foolish, but it was probably one of the greatest decisions of my life.  After listening to the entire two disc album in order, I have come to love every single song on the album.  I have recommended this album to all of my friends and they have fallen in love with it as well.  Despite it being a bit of a departure from \\"Siamese Dream\\" (one of my favorite albums of the 1990's) I believe it to be even better and I don't understand why it has a better rating than this one, albeit half a star.  If you have been thinking about buying this album even the slightest bit, go for it.  You will not be disappointed.    If you decide to buy this album, definitely go for the CD version, the entire two-disc set is great.  It comes with amazing artwork on the discs, cover, and inserts.  I have the case sitting on my bookshelf and it looks totally rad.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Brilliant Book. I've read this one, Ender in Exile and Speaker for the Dead.    All three books have the most fleshed out description of any lead character that I've ever seen. Its almost as though Ender, the lead, is a real person and Orson Scott Card sat down and interviewed him. I almost felt like Ender was actually someplace in this world...    I think this is because the author's description of Ender is so thorough, and the depth of thought, dialogue and knowledge of human nature so great that I couldn't believe that OSC simply pulled this from his head. I know its fiction, but the characters in this book \\"think\\" and \\"talk\\" in ways that are genius to be honest. I've never seen people in real life come close to it. Probably because I'm not surrounded by people who study sociology/psychology so it was all pretty interesting to me. OSC must be a genius...if he can make characters this deep, with so much knowledge, obviously he must have it..if fictional characters \\"think\\" like this, I really wonder how OSC thinks...in the book Ender is a genius, and when Scott explains why Ender does certain things, you think to yourself, you know what, that makes perfect sense, but had I been in the same situation I never would have thought of it..its amazing...    In summary, books are great, characterization is amazing, depth of thought and dialogue is unparalleled..
B00280LYIC|5.0|this one of the two series of books that I have been hooked on. I always pre-order the next book and wait in anticipation for it to come out again only to be dissapointed that i finished it in like a week. But if your looking for a good series this is the one for you!
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I find myself using this great little app almost every day. It&apos;s incredibly useful and the developer keeps it up to date. And it&apos;s also free! Totally worth a donation.
0143038419|5.0|I was very surprised by all of the negative reviews, but to each their own. I could go on and on about what I liked about this book and the reasons for which I would highly recommend it to each and everyone I know however, I'm afraid it would just fall on deaf ears. I think Gilbert put together a wonderful piece. I can see myself in a lot of her experiences. Further, she was blessed with an extraordinary opportunity to travel and \\"find herself\\" and it's an interesting peek inside her incredible journey.
0553801473|3.0|After 4 years waiting for this book my expectations were definitely high, but I was also ready to be disappointed. In the end I was disappointed, because I had hoped that Dance would be better than Feast, taking into account that the author spent 5 years preparing it and because Dance was going to bring back the stories of some of my favourite characters. However, this book goes more or less the same way as Feast went: too much travelogue, not enough action. And whereas that doesn't necessarily mean that the books are bad, the lack of significant development in any level makes Feast and Dance worse than the previous books.<br /><br />Now for the good things: in spite of all the travelogue, the story is enjoyable. Some of the character's storylines are truly engrossing and even if their plots don't advance that much, what we get to read is very entertaining.<br />I even enjoyed the Ironborn chapters! (and that is a great improvement from Feast)<br /><br />3.5 stars.

B004ZH66XO|5.0|The goal is to eat fish smaller than yourself without being eaten along the way.  A very cute game that gradually increases in difficulty.

0062073559|5.0|Agatha Christie's 16th Hercule Poirot mystery is one of her most well-known works. Originally published in 1937, \\"Death on the Nile\\" is a crisply written whodunit. A helpful floor diagram of each suspect's boat cabin is included. I read this over thirty years ago while in high school and either my subconscious dredged up the old information deep in the cobwebbed recesses of my mind or I'm getting a little smarter because, half-way through the book, I figured out who did it. Ms. Christie takes more time than usual developing the characters before murder ensues. With her clean writing style, over a dozen suspects and numerous red herrings, the author will keep most readers guessing until the very end. Simply a great, fun read.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|I first head this C.D or bits of it at a friends house, then watch the UTube of it and fell in love with it, so bought them all and haven't stopped playing them.

B002ZG98LO|2.0|Channel surfing is like panning for gold:  Sometimes (rarely) you turn up a nugget; but most of the time you just get a dog.  Add PREDATORS to the bow-wows; I tuned in to this barker and--like watching the proverbial train go off the rails--I couldn't take my eyeballs away.  The entire premise evokes nothing but a yawn:  A group of thugs dumped on a planet to be hunted by the dreadlocked, halitosis predators (only, mind you, there are two different species of predators, egads!); in other words, unlikable characters that we don't care about meet violent endings.  Aren't we supposed to cheer?  Well, I did laugh, but I don't think this film is a comedy.<br /><br />Adrien Brody needs a new agent, because he's doing a stellar job harpooning his career.  Here, playing some sort of disinterested mercenary--while whispering in his best \\"tough guy\\" rasp--he is a halibut out of the bay and about as believable as my attorney going to confession.  In other words, it doesn't work.  Laurence Fishburne makes a brief appearance in a cameo that can only be summarized thus:  Howler.  Alice Braga plays the only female role--in stereotypical fashion--and the predators roar and pounce and disappear and reappear and need a cosmetic surgeon and bleed buckets of green, culminating in an uber violent ending where Brody gets to play predator pinata.  It's silly, lame, nonsensical, whimsical, banal, trite, and boring, and those are its good points.  If PREDATORS is the new brand for this franchise, I'll take my green elsewhere.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning

1451629184|5.0|What an amazing story. I'm so glad she told her story. Now heres a girl who has resilience and I admire her immensely. It helps to explain why some children stay and don't try to escape, which is what we all are thinking when someone is kidnapped. But this book lets you know, it's not so simple when you're a kid. I understand now what a kid is thinking when they are snatched from their familiar surroundings. It's so hard to imagine her situation but she tells it quit truthfully and unashamed. God must have some very important work for this girl!!!!

0300169787|4.0|Great, clear photos and good text. It's worth buying, especially at this wonderful price. Cool hologram cover. Despite that, I can't quite give it a full 5 stars.  The exhibition was overwhelmingly beautiful and absolutely worth the long line! McQueen's genius is apparent in any medium, and it is so wonderful to see the depth of his appreciation for art history, seeing these pieces all together (among his other wonderful qualities). But the book definitely doesn't have the same \\"wow\\" factor as the exhibition, or really McQueen's pieces themselves, which is a little bit of a sorry loss for someone who didn't get a chance to see it at the Met.   Great addition to your coffee-table book collection but idk, just a little something is missing to make it as exciting.  But this is just my opinion :)

0439023513|3.0|Everything about this book, this trilogy, moved me profoundly. It was an emotional roller coaster to watch sixteen year old Katniss fight her way to victory in two Hunger Games, experience astonishing loss, and become a symbol of the rebel fire to overthrow oppressive rule in order to create a new world.  Mockingjay perfectly match the brilliant pacing and plotting of The Hunger Games and Catching Fire. Like the first two, Mockigjay is full of action, suspense, and wonderful characterization. These elements weave a great tale that makes the reader stop and consider the world through the eyes of sixteen year old Katniss Everdeen.  Katniss was introduced as is a strong and resourceful survivor who learned how to persevere in a very harsh environment. Following her victory in the arena and as she was forced into the role of both symbol and pawn for others to use for their own objectives, she still retained a semblance of control.  In Mockingjay, Katniss had become more angsty, sad, and angry as she experiences even more tragic hardships but though all her trials, she maintains her core as the girl from the Hunger Games who had to keep her family alive since the age of twelve.  The post-traumatic stress, the mental breakdowns, and near insanity that beset Katniss were all played out realistically. It was a testament to Collins for not falling back on the gimmick of the tramatized heroine becoming an omnipotent uber woman who conquers the world. Katniss is depicted as an adolescent already damaged by hunger, violence and oppression when she is thrown into center of political intrigue and deception.  I loved learning more in depth insight into the wonderful secondary characters as Finnick, Annie, Boggs, Johanna, and Katniss' team.  This novel was so incredibly moving; it was a crucible of sad and sweet, pain and healing that sometime left me physically drained. There were times I had to set the book down and reset in order to get through certain parts. Collins could really build up love and connection for a character...then just as suddenly tear them away.  It was devastating become attached to so many extraordinary characters, who were symbols of hope and happiness for the future, only to extinguish their light in the next chapter. Such inexplicable deaths of certain characters just left me with a feeling of emptiness.  As for the love triangle, the whole Team Gale/Team Peeta dilemma merely comes across as a distraction, especially when there is a much greater plot present. Gale and Peeta are exemplary in their own right. Gale the hunter is strong, resilient, and resourceful. Peeta, the boy with the bread, is sweet, sincere, and devoted.  Both possessed fine qualities that were in perfect sync with Katniss, however, a triangle is an impossible situation and the only resolution is that one character will be shortchanged, discarded, or hurt.  Overall, The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and  Mockingjay combined is one of the most memorable and moving trilogies I've ever had the pleasure of reading. The girl who was on fire captured a piece of my heart.
1451629184|5.0|I knew this would be a difficult book to read because I already knew some of the things that happened to Jaycee because of the news coverage, but I felt I wanted to know how a girl could live through 18 years of being held.      I was not able to put the book down. Finished reading it the same day it arrived. Many areas made me sick, angry, but so pleased to read the true love of her Mom, Sister, Aunt and two daughters helped her through it and again when they were reunited.    The book has brought it into light how the system failed her.  When NO ONE went into the yard to investigate what was back there.    Through all of my feelings as I read the book.........I am glad I did. We need to stand up, pass laws, and see that this never happens again. We need to SAVE OUR CHILDREN in all ways possible!
0061714372|5.0|I actually read this entire book in one day.  I have been a long time Hard Rock fan and the history of Metallica and Megadeth was intriguing to me.  I saw Dave Mustaine's behind the music episodes, saw his appearance on Metallica's \\"Some Kind of Monster\\", and saw his appearance on Nightline \\"Beyond Belief\\" so I had a bit of background before reading this.  I have followed the progress of Megadeth and Metallica from back in the early 80's up to today.  This book gives what appears to be a brash, honest, in your face account of his journey through music, loss, recovery, love and spirituality.  I have met the sponsor Dave had at one treatment program he was in, and realize that Dave heard a hard core presentation of the Truth of addiction, alcoholism, spirituality and receovery.  It echoes throughout this book.  I would love to read about Dave's recent \\"reunion\\" with the Big Four and what effect that has had upon him.  It was a natural progression of the book that something a cool as the Big Four would occur.  Thanks to Dave for this honest presentation of his life.  If you have ever liked a Megadeth song, ever, this book is a must(aine) read.
B0024Y7H10|5.0|I have been a long time fan of the entire franchise and hesitated watching this, sure that it would be a pathetic ruination of the terminator stories.  I was so entirely wrong!!  They have managed to keep the soul of the story, while adding a few very well-defined characters who have really found a place in my heart.  That's one the things that I like best about the show:  it's focus stays tight on a small cast and you really get to know them and care about them.  They are complex.  Great show.
1451629184|4.0|Book clearly pictures who jaycee dugard is and overwhelmed by her patience to survive. Many people are asking question that why she didn't try to escape?    As far as reading the book, i think, her step-father carl is the reason for her to not escape.    She might be thinking whether carl would allow her to stay with them if she goes back.And might be thinking of his comments on her having babies.    First question she asks the officers is 'whether my mom is still with my step father carl'? this answers lot of questions.    Had her step father carl been nice to her, am sure she would have tried to escape in those years.    Anyone who tends to marry a person whose not their kid's biological father must assure the kids that no matter what, their mom would be with them.

B004VUP8WK|3.0|Somehow I missed the release day on this one!  I picked it up from Best Buy (I normally buy here, but I saw it in the store and impulse took over.)  As soon as I got back to my car, I threw it in the CD player.  I've never hit the \\"skip\\" button before on a Morbid Angel track!  Normally, I'd put an album in and listen to it from start-to-finish (several times over, even!)  Well, there are some definite skip-worthy tracks on here.  Don't get me wrong, some tracks are very good, in my opinion.  I rather enjoyed tracks 5, 7 and 9-11.  They did change things up a bit, and yeah, the fill-in-drummer certainly played well.  If you're an open-minded Morbid Angel fan, give it a shot.  It's certainly  a departure from their other albums (even though it's still an alphabetical release.)
1451629184|5.0|My heart goes out to this girl, what she has endured at the hands of this monster. She says it like it is in her own way and in her own viewpoint. For a little girl to be subjected to such an atrocity is overwhelming, I thank God everyday I did not have to go through this experience and was well protected. I am amazed at her ability to stay focused and balanced in her perspective and growth in her new life. She is very strong and positive. She has endured alot and she tells it like it is and what it was like for her. She is so innocent in her explanations and reflections. I am halfway through the book and look forward to every moment reading it. I just want to reach out and hug her! Herlove for her mother and sister kept her going, family is so special and the bonds of love help us to endure the test of time.
B00003CXAA|5.0|The Godfather has always been one of my favorite books.  I saw the movies years ago and wanted my 17 year old daughter to see them.  The set is a great addition to  my collection.

I'm very happy with my purchase.

B0052AJ1OO|4.0|I saw this movie shortly after it came out thinking it was just going to be a so-so movie.  Instead it ended up being one of the rare movies I've seen more than once on the big screen.  Mostly in part to the excellent score by the Chemical Brothers and how they obviously worked with the director in capturing the movie.     Like older soundtracks from movies such as Akira, Ghost in the Shell, Chariots of Fire, Terminator and so on those movies while classics could be questioned for semi blah parts within the movie yet had a soundtrack that kept you in to the end.      And this is one of those movies had the soundtrack been the latest  current trend bands or popular sounds it would've turned it into a mediocre film to be forgotten but, thanks to Chemical Brothers working close with the director they were able to make a memorable film to last at least on the cult status.      I hope to see the Chemical Brothers take on another such risky movie such as this and turn it into a piece of art.  Cause Hanna took a tired genre of action films but took some interesting twist of showing it with a solid soundtrack to place it's self above most films of it's style in the last 10 years.      Two quick moments of director and Chemical Brothers blending sound and visual really well would be track two where Hanna escapes from the underground compound where the both visual and sound gave a great feeling of urgency of Hanna's escape.  And, track three where project lady (sorry can't recall her name at moment) meets with Hans in order to kill Hanna and her Father.  It captures the fairy tale element of Hanna's lost innocence before all this came to be, to the point of the evil of Hans.......
B002ZG993Q|4.0|You'll not see amazing jumps from one floor to the next through windows and then rolling across the floor and out the door stunt moves, nor the entire entire geopolitical structure hanging in the balance while it awaits a last second salvation by an all too prescient secret agent.  This film is about what happens when a person awakens to the hard truth of what their chosen occupation has done to them and of the difficulty in removing oneself from such a predicament.  The cinematography gives stunning views from many aspects, the R rating is not for language or violence, it's an adult film dealing with ugly subjects for a time when you have about 2 hours to sit still and take it in; just don't expect Jason Bourne or Jack Bauer on this job.

B001FB4W0C|5.0|Season Four of Supernatural ups the ante once again. The hosts of Heaven have finally sided with the brothers, but they are certainly not what anyone had expected. First off, the ending of the previous season left us in a quandary about the show's future.<br /><br />Not to fear, this season contains some fairly epic scenes - the living teddy bear, the whole Oktoberfest episode, the meeting of a new angel, and from the word of mouth of someone is not of fan of time travel, the time travel episode is one of the best for the season. But we are firmly on the heels of uber-demon Lilith. And that was a spot of good news for the Winchester brothers.<br /><br />Special Features are nothing but the expected: commentary on a few episodes, extended and unaired episodes, a gag real; there is a behind the scenes called The Mythology of Supernatural, split in three sections being Heaven, Hell, Purgatory. The tech specs are on par with the previous season set.<br /><br />Supernatural doesn't seem to be slowing down whatsoever. In my eyes, its the best thing to be be in television or film in regards of the wanna-be thrillers or horror.

B003Y5H5C4|4.0|30 Minutes or Less is a slacker comedy from Ruben Fleischer, the director of [[ASIN:B002WY65VU Zombieland]], that runs only 53 minutes more than its title suggests. The story of a pizza delivery boy who is forced to rob a bank by two thugs who strap a bomb to him, much has been made about how the film bears a remarkable similarity to a real-life, more tragic story from a few years ago. The creators have vehemently denied this story served as inspiration and while the true story may have provided the kernel of an idea for the screenwriters, the rest is taken in a substantially different, some may argue disrespectful, direction.    Jesse Eisenberg, fresh off his Oscar-nomination for The Social Network, plays Nick, a 20-something pizza boy who spends his days smoking pot and failing to deliver pizzas in the \\"30 minutes or less\\" timeframe the pizza chain promises. He has only one friend, Chet (Aziz Ansari), a substitute teacher, but the two have a falling out over various admissions, including Nick's relationship with Chet's sister Katie (Dilshad Vadsaria). Meanwhile, two losers named Dwayne (Danny McBride) and Travis (Nick Swardson) live under the shadow of Dwayne's domineering, ex-military father The Major (Fred Ward), while making $10 an hour cleaning his pool. At a strip-club, Dwayne tells a stripper about his father winning the lottery and how he could stand to inherit a couple million dollars if The Major were to die. Promising Dwayne a permanent position in his lap, the stripper tells Dwayne that if he can come up with $100,000, she knows someone who can make his father disappear indefinitely. With their get-rich-quick scheme in place, Dwayne and Travis ambush Nick, strap a bomb to his chest, and give him 10 hours to rob a bank.     The plot makes no apologies for how ridiculous it is, but is actually clever in the way it gives a rather stupid plan to really stupid characters. After all, Dwayne and Travis' plan to have Nick rob a bank and give them the money so they can get some money is rather redundant. This does however work well, as the Dwayne and Travis characters are completely witless. History has suggested that a film with such a short running time shows a lack of ideas on the part of the screenwriter. In this case, it works for the film rather than against it. 30 Minutes or Less is brief, but not a single scene seems unnecessary and the pacing is top-notch. This is a comedy that moves very quickly and is both very exciting and very funny without feeling too rushed. The actual robbery scene, one of the highlights, is laugh-out-loud funny and genuinely exciting as well. The bomb strapped to Nick provides the story with a sense of urgency too. The script will be dismissed as derivative due to the buddy-comedy, action-comedy elements that have been heavily used in other films but it's successful in the way it finds its footing very quickly and never becomes too dark, too serious, or too light-hearted. It's fast-moving and very consistent in the way it unfolds and how it keeps the humor fresh in a mostly un-funny situation. It actually ends well too, with an abrupt ending that is a Hollywood ending at heart but isn't a complete Hollywood cop-out. It does end abruptly and readings have revealed a much darker, effective ending in the original script, but it still succeeds by wisely avoiding the cheesy Hollywood need to wrap everything up nicely so audiences can leave feeling warm and fuzzy.    Fleischer is an excellent director that can balance the different genre elements with finesse and style. Whether he's directing dialogue scenes or the obligatory (in this type of film) car chase sequence, it all works and comes together nicely. There are also some subtle elements in the way he establishes the characters through look and attire. What is Fleischer suggesting by having Dwayne and Travis, the film's dumbest characters, wear Metallica and Insane Clown Posse shirts? If he is suggesting something, I applaud him. The film moves with a constant energy, helped along by a cast that has energy in spades. Eisenberg handles comedy quite well and he makes his performance in The Social Network seem even more impressive by comparison. His character Nick mentioning Facebook is an amusing little aside by itself. Ansari is a bundle of comedic energy, yet keeps his amped-up acting from going completely over-the-top. McBride, whom I consider to be one of the funniest comedians around, doesn't venture far from the dim-witted, egotistical jerk character he's made his name playing, but McBride possesses a comedic delivery that is unmatched by his contemporaries and he's as effective and hilarious as ever. Everyone has met a guy like the characters McBride plays and he plays these types with a satirical gusto that is much more layered than its low-brow humor suggests. Michael Peña is becoming the go-to-guy for comedic roles with over-the-top accents, but as a talented dramatic actor he makes each one different and, while over-the-top, it's never campy. His performance as the potential hitman Chongo is a highlight here. Even Nick Swardson, whom I never find particularly funny, is actually well-utilized here. There's a friendly, energetic chemistry between Eisenberg, Ansari, McBride, and Swardson that really drives the film. It's apparent that the actors involved had a good time making it, which translates well onscreen and makes the movie even more of a joy to watch. When actors can be seen clearly having fun with their work, this generally has a positive effect on the audience viewing the film. From the actor's demeanor and rapport, I'd guess this was about as fun to make as it was to watch.    30 Minutes or Less is simple summer, Hollywood fun with a cast of talented comedic actors working within the confines of stronger-than-expected material. It hasn't been received too well, but comedy is the most subjective genre of film and film critics don't exactly fall into this film's demographic. It's fun and energetic, with non-stop humor that will be enjoyed by the average moviegoer and anyone who has liked the previous work of the principal cast. How one can pan a film so highly enjoyable is beyond me.    GRADE: B+
B003Y5H53S|4.0|I bought Rango on dvd without ever having seen it because it was a good bargain. I had my cousins coming over for the weekend and figured it would be a good movie to watch with them. Well they loved it, even though one of them had just seen in at daycamp during the week before but she didn't mind watching it again. My husband even got into it. Glad I bought it on a whim after all!

B0048FQ0HU|5.0|I only listened to the first cd since I got it, but that was enought to rush to my computer and spead the good news...  The cd is, of course, read by the author,may God bless her for sharing this wonderful secret, and therefore it is alot easier to read without getting distracted.   Along with the author's voice reading the material to you, the cd itself has classical music in the background to make it even more dramatic and lifelike. This music is similar to the one of the small video underneath the product on the amazon page. The music is invigorating and exciting and makes you feel like jumping up and down saying,\\"YES! I AM WORTH IT! I AM WONDERFUL! I AM UNIQUE AND SPECIAL! ALL THAT I WANT AND LOVE AND WANT TO DO I CAN DO!\\"  To but the power in a nutshell: LOVE AND YOU WILL RECIEVE ANYTHING YOU WANT!   It dosent' come more easier than that.    P.S. don't pay attention to those guys who write negative reviews. They are not harnessing the force of love, which is the positve force in the universe. They need to push the heavy clouds away from their hearts and let some of the sun's rays splash upon their faces. They need to understand that the reason why they are not \\"happy\\" or \\"content\\" with The Power or The Secret is that they are letting their own ignorance get infront of them.     Do not let this happen to you.     Please.

0811876373|5.0|This is a great book if you want to have a go at making unique party treats for kids (or for kids at heart!). The photos in the book are fantastic and the step by step instructions and tips are well worth the read! I had never made cake pops before and had a great time doing bunny pops for my daughter's 4th birthday with a bunny theme! There are stacks of other great ideas. You can actually get a lot of the same info from the bakeralla website but if you like having a book you can take out and flick through with your kids to pick out what to do - this is fantastic. It is metal spiral bound so it sits flat on the table. I bought a second book and gave it away as a gift to a \\"domestic goddess\\" friend who is into baking and she loved it too.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|I love this game. Always an excellent entertaining game to play. I love the graphics and UI and everything about it.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|This was a very long read, but SO worth it.  I was reading it while my car was in for an oil change and actually jumped and let out a little yelp when the door next to me opened!  And that was during the day in broad daylight!!  That is how scary this book is!  What I love about Stephen King is you really get to know his characters.  And that goes for this book.  I was actually kinda sad when I finished it, not that it was a disappointing ending, far from it, but I wanted those characters to go on and on.  I found myself reading this book any chance I had, even if it was only for five minutes.  Couldn't get enough!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I enjoy this game, and it starts running smoothly enough. But soon (within 1-3 levels) it starts to slow noticeably and become less and less responsive. Then it shuts my Droid Charge down altogether and the only thing I can do is take the battery out (cursing my Otterbox cover all the while) , put it back in, and reboot.  Oh well, I guess I&apos;ll just go back to just stealing my spouse&apos;s iPhone to get my PvZ fix, and wait this app to work.
0439023521|5.0|I agree with all the reviews:<br /><br />\\"Couldn't put it down\\"<br />\\"I felt like I was in the games\\"<br />\\"Amazing\\"<br /><br />The world that Suzanne Collins created is brutal .. hostile .. controling.  Can you imagine sending your child into an arena to fight for his or her life?<br /><br />Even though this is a young adult book .. it's a must read for all ages.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br />Monica<br />San Diego<br /><br />PS:  Currently reading book 2
B004DMIIOG|5.0|There's only a few things I can say. If you are a fan of anime and loves a good science fiction story with epic ending then this is for you. The only downside is the picture above is a bit misleading. When I got my blu-ray dvd it only comes with the plastic blu-ray casing sealed with a plastic packaging without the blu-ray cardboard box. I want the box because it's going to be part of my growing anime blu-ray collection. It is a bit disappointing not have the box included with my copy but I am not gonna deduct the score on this product, simply because this anime is just plain amazing.
B004LWZW24|5.0|Years ago, young Josh (Patrick Wilson) suffered from night terrors; intense dreams that left the young boy terrified and screaming.  Now, years have passed and Josh has his own family.  Josh, along with his wife Renai (Rose Byrne) and their three children have moved into a new home.  Everything is fine for a while until the oldest son Dalton (Ty Simpkins) suffers a fall in the attic.  After the fall, Dalton slips into a coma.  The trouble is that the doctors cannot explain why he is in the coma.      After Dalton's fall, Renai begins seeing strange apparitions and hearing noises.  Josh, while somewhat skeptical, believes his wife and, thinking that somehow the house is haunted, the family moves a new home.  Although settled in their new home, the mysterious apparitions and noises didn't disappear with the move.  Soon, Josh, Renai, and the children are running out of options.  With seemingly nowhere else to turn, Renai enlists the help of a trained psychic (Lin Shaye) to determine the problem.  Upon her investigation, she determines that Dalton has the ability of astral projection, and his spirit has been corrupted by evil and he's now imprisoned in a dimension known as \\"The Further\\".  Only Josh, himself also able to astral project, can save his son from the demons who wish to possess him.  Will he succeed before its too late?    This is an excellent movie.  There's no blood and gore here, only truly terrifying psychological terror.  The story line is well-conceived, and the acting is very good.  I watched the movie twice, and I jumped each time I saw it.  Be sure to watch very closely, because there are some hidden clues throughout the course of the film.  The ending is totally unexpected, too.  You'll definitely be scared watching \\"Insidious\\".  Highly recommended.
0307946711|5.0|Really great read, you should pick it up and see for yourself.  Love the way the author wrote the book through the perspective of one day a year through Dex and Em's point of view.  It was quite different from anything I've read as of late.  Interested to see how the movie turns out now.
1402217722|4.0|This story is actually a Georgian romance ( Georgette Heyer usually rights Regency romances).  Hory is one of my favorite examples of an imperfect but absolutely adorable character. Hory is unorthodox, short and plain, and badly stammers.  Because of this, the reader actually gets a dose of laugh out loud fun.  The Earl of Rule is looking to settle down and he chooses Hory's sister who wants to actually marry for love.  Hory steps in, willing to make the sacrifice.    I thoroughly enjoyed this story.  Both Hory and the Earl are great loveable characters.  I was afraid that I would become irritated by Hory's stammer, but it didn't get old, and was quite endearing.  I haven't discussed the plot much because all of the characters are so amazing.  However, the book has great pacing and has a bit of comedy with a rather predictable ending.  I would recommend this book to all historical fiction fans.

0385341008|4.0|This book begins in England at the end of World War II when Juliet Ashton expresses discontent with writing about the war and must search for a topic for her next book.  It is a compilation of notes, letters, and telegrams between friends and acquaintances.  She receives and unexpected letter from Dawsey Adams and stumbles into the world of the Guernsey Literary and Sweet Potato Peel Pie Society--who were cut off from the rest of the world during the Nazi occupation.  Through her correspondence, Juliet learns about the groups tastes in books, the effect of the war on their lives, and many other quirky and fun every day tidbits.  She decides to visit herself leading to life-changing results.<br /><br />I loved this book despite the confusing name.  This is a book about book-lovers, romance, friendship, and history.  There is something for everyone.  You will find yourself laughing at the local busy-body, Adelaide Addison, and cheering for the local hero, Elizabeth McKenna.  You will laugh and cry with these adorable and quirky characters.  You might even wish you knew them yourself.  I found the book to be an easy read, but I didn't like the constant back-and-forth that came with the the entire book being a compilation of letters and notes.  I'm sure that's what makes the book what it is but I found it difficult to keep up with initially, but when I caught on, I too was swept into the world of the Guernsey Sweet Potato Peel Pie Society.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I can't believe the quality of the dvds themselves let alone how much material was on them! All of the deleted scenes, behind the scenes, every single bit was not left out. I love it!
B0058OUJA4|2.0|another tower defense game with bad graphics. not worth $1.99 fieldrunners is a lot better, and has better graphics, and gameplay.
B001NXDIMK|3.0|The theme of DAMAGES 2, stated two or three times, is that Patty Hewes, the crusading liberal lawyer, is selfish, narcissistic, and bitchy -- but so is everybody else. Therefore, since she goes after polluters and stock manipulators, she's \\"complexly\\" good.     That's a good enough theme, and the acting is good, but the bread and butter plotting is dreadful to the point of absurdity. Patty hires murderers to kill people she barely knows who MIGHT betray her. When she does this, it makes her weep -- but she does it anyway. There's your character complexity.     Patty and her firm engage in bribery of judges and advance payment to witnesses, obvious felonies that no one with so much power and money would engage in. As a matter of routine they risk instant jail time, disbarment, newspaper disgrace ... the list is endless. Of course, hiring killers, which they also do fairly routinely, is not exactly wise practice for a millionaire plaintiff's attorney either.     Characters shift their loyalties on a whim and switch them back on another whim. Patty is told repeatedly that she will have to drop her suit against a big corporation -- IF ITS STOCK VALUE GOES UP! What? She has to monitor the corporation's stock price day to day, and pick up her lawsuit and drop it again based on what the stock price does? I don't think so.     As in most legal series, the characters spend much of their time as detectives, spotting facts that others have missed, going to dangerous meetings wearing a wire, etc. Lawyers almost never do that kind of stuff, but in a show where the heroine is saved by one of her tormentors being shot in the head from behind -- you can hardly expect these brilliant attorneys to concern themselves much with legal matters. I think there's not one legal issue in the entire season, except whether certain evidence will be admitted, and to solve that legal problem, Patty bribes a judge.     It's all a kind of madness. The actors act very well, especially considering that they have no roles to play. They are on side A for half an hour, then on side B, then back to side A for the next episode. The hired assassins even break free from the people who hired them. One hired assassin threatens his hirer with assassination if he doesn't drop a lawsuit which then -- perfectly easily goes on without him! By the end of the show hired assassins are killing one another for free, based on things like whom they like to sleep with.     Well over half the incidents in the show are not believable, and none of them shows lawyers being lawyers; the lawyers respond to almost every problem they encounter by planning to commit a crime.    Please! It's fun to be cynical, but only when you're being cynical about real people, not cardboard cutouts getting their brains blown out in basement garages.
B0058OUJA4|3.0|looks almost identical but i guess since it has a different name its not the same game? fun and great graphics.

0545265355|5.0|Learned of this trilogy through word of mouth. I took a chance and purchased all three. I wasn't let down. I loved the character developement, heroine, political situation and different setting. Hooked from the get-go. This author created an intense world with characters to match. These books will NOT disappoint.
B003L77G38|5.0|(so this show does not get cancelled) -it almost got the axe but Fox gave it mercy. One of the best sci-fi series ever, right up there with Lost, but like Lost you have to follow the series from the beginning, if you do the show becomes that much more compelling! I cannot wait for season 4!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Thanks Amazon. Everything was in perfect shape. Movie works and looks great. 5 stars. Would like shipping to be cheaper. However, I feel it was a great buy for not finding the movie on any other website for a cheaper price.
0553386794|5.0|One word.... Masterpiece!! George R. R. Martin's work is supurb. I can't wait to read the others in this series.  I only hope they are 1/2 as good as Game of Thrones!
1400052181|5.0|I am a biologist and professor and this story greatly impacted me. I graduated from graduate school in 1971 and had never heard about this lady or her cells. I wondered why, and after reading this book I soon discovered it was economics over ethics!  I am so moved by her family's plight that this will be required reading for my advanced biology classes and in their writing a paper on Biological Ethics!
B004J4WN0I|5.0|What a breath of fresh air.  Good dialogue.  Multi-generational multi-ethnic environment.  Interesting relationships.   Just what I needed after too many other books taking themselves too seriously.  Reads quickly and leaves you wanting to visit Tempe just to see Atticus' store.  Well worth the time and money.
006085412X|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book to our son before our daughter was born. I really think it prepared him for being a big brother. He still loves to read it, and he does things to help with her just like the little boy in the book.
B001VNB54A|3.0|The emphasis on the soap opera detracted from the full story of the Pacific campaign of WW II.  I expected to be educated, not titillated ( I already knew that men on the eve of battle  and the women they are with have a lot of sex, but some of it was beyond unbelievable.  The lovely daughter of Greek immigrants sneaks into his room in her parents' house?  give me a break.) It would have benefitted from more about what was happening (and why) in the bigger picture.  Production values were outstanding, however.
B005DD7H50|5.0|The character (Bradley) eventually overcomes the side effects and finally put it to good use. The drug works only if you're already smart. It doesn't work on uneducated thugs or single-minded tycoons. It works on ordinary average people who puts their education to good use. Another thing I liked about the character is that he didn't try to con everyone. He just made an honest money although going through the loan shark was a dumb idea. I liked De Niro's role and he really shines at being a bull-headed businessman. I also liked the ending where the character tweaked the bugs out of the drug and improved it so it becomes permanent. He could've been an FBI profiler solving tough cases or a doctor finding cures for deadly disease instead of a Senator but of course, that's just me.    PS - he reminds me of a TV show 'Chuck' where he fought a bunch of losers by remembering what he saw from an old Bruce Lee movie.
1594202842|5.0|Hilarious and touching, logical and whimsical, superbly written with a distinctive authorial voice, this is a polished gem of a book.  There is an abiding intelligence present which lightly touches many societal issues (such as the role of cultural influence) which are conveniently absent in serious discussion in the US today.     Those who read this volume as a recipe book for raising children are lamentably missing the point.  Others who read this as a case of China vs the US are equally misguided.  Only by appreciating this slender book as the personal story it is, and tuning in to its charm, irony and mock-arrogance, can one understand its special allure and its deserving place on the shelf as a true classic.
0060012234|5.0|This is yet another of those Young Adult novels I was a little scared to read; in this case, for how shallow it could sound, it was also the cover that worried me, I had a \\"bad\\" feeling. And again I was wrong. Sure, Geography Club is not really about the romance, even if there is a teen romance in it, it's more about the growth of all the characters, but it's not a dramatic story, on the contrary, it has even a somewhat light and happy mood, like the reader is able to see that everything will be find for Russel and his friends.<br /><br />Russel is a gay kid; for a kid living in a small town he is pretty smart, and even if he has never had any sexual experience, he lives his being gay in the net, attending chats where he is able to talk with other boys his same age and with his same trouble. But an online friend and a real friend are completely different, and it arrives a moment when Russel needs the physical presence of someone... yes, I think it was also arrived the moment when Russel wanted a boyfriend, but more than that he needed to feel he was not alone.<br /><br />Russel jumps to the chance of meeting another teenager from one of the chats, and he is surprised, and pleased, when he finds out is Kevin, one of the most popular kids at school. But Russel is young, and yes, his best characteristic is that he is real, so no perfect at all; as soon as he finds out about Kevin, he wants to gossip with his friends, and so he talks with Min, his best girlfriend, and to his surprise Min comes out to him as bisexual, and then Min brings on Terese who brings on Ike... and an impromptu club is born.<br /><br />As I said, no one of the above kids are heroes, and no one wants the burden of being the gay kid at school; they decide to misguide their gay club for a Geography Club, so boring no one will want to join. But after the first session when everyone was able to share their experience, they discover that being gay is not enough of a reason to be together, and their club to survive need to have a reason to be. Again, no much courage among these boys and girls, and surprise surprise, for once the hero of the novel, Russel, is not an hero at all, on the contrary he is actually the one who will behave in the worst way against another kid. That will be the moment for Russel to grow, to realize that being the cool kid and having a cool boyfriend is not actually possible in small town high school; he has to make a choice, and this is probably the most \\"dramatic\\" event of all the novel: as you can see, yes, for a 16 years old that can be pretty life changing decision, but it's not the end of the world.<br /><br />I liked Russel, in good and bad he was who he was supposed to be: a teenager, with his trouble and his dreams, and with all the life in front of him to realize them.a reason to be.

B004SBQAN8|5.0|An interesting sci-fi film filled with alot of action and some amazing battle scenes with both natural and unnatural powers. The storyline is easy enough to follow and the end implies a possible sequel. A young man with a secret past and destiny about to unfold, John Smith is running from forces trying to kill him. He is protected by a guardian but also has powers within him that will change him by the end of the film. On a grand scale, this is by no means an epic film, but the action, plots, twists and turns, keep you watching and thrilled.
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Just a wonderful movie!  I used to surf when younger and this movie makes me wish I had continued on to eventually compete.  I still love the ocean and those waves.  The scenery and surfing action is so beautiful and really shows what is involved.  The story is based on a true life girl who is absolutely remarkable. So inspiring for other young ones to imitate her attitude.  Just a Wonderful Movie.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|An interesting re-make of the Charles Bronson original with plenty of the same action some viewers will enjoy. The scenarios are more current and the usual bad guy, good guy scenes prevail.
0738212415|5.0|When I was 13 years old my art teacher wrote on my end of year report card that I tried but had no talent.  At that point I stopped trying.  Now I'm starting to catch up with all the things I've spent my life wishing I could do, and drawing is one of them.  I have a lot of good books that will help me when I've got the basics under my belt, but most of them jump too quickly from very simple exercises to drawings that are way above my present standard.  This book doesn't do that.  Each lesson builds on the one before, introducing new concepts slowly enough that you can feel yourself developing the foundation skills you need to be able to take on more complex drawings.  It'll take me a lot longer than 30 days to complete this book - 30 weeks perhaps? - but the investment in time will be worth it.  No, I'll never be a Rembrandt or Picasso, but after just three lessons I can already draw well enough to impress other people who think they can't draw, and that's good enough for me!

0811875040|4.0|Honestly, just the buttercream frosting recipe itself is worth the purchase of this book!      I've tried other buttercreams and they've all tasted too \\"buttery\\"... this one is just SO good... almost TOO good! I've tried macarons in store and thought they were fantastic because they weren't too sweet.  When I tried Miette's version, my macs tasted much sweeter, but I'll give the recipe along with a few others to try.      I would say that one downside is that some of the quantities/measurements are printed wrong, but I received an email from Amazon stating that they will ship a corrected version to me free in October when it's available.
0790742780|3.0|The product is a gift so therefor I have not seen it.   I will have a better idea of the product once the person I am giving it to gets it.

031261246X|3.0|I enjoyed the book, the plot and all.  About the action that takes place in France, I fint it very unfortunate that the author did not take the time to review the text with a French native speaker. Company names are very bad (I suspect a google translation here), and some scenes depicted in the book are simply not relevant (the \\"Gaullist protesters marching\\" was hilarious).

B004VQFQ2Q|4.0|I had pretty high hopes for this reissue as it was reported that a complete remix of the original tapes was to be done. However, Tony Iommi stated that the original tapes could not be located and this is only a remastering. Nonetheless, the sound is pretty good and if you listen loudly I think you will appreciate the remaster efforts. The additional live concert CD featuring Ian Gillan is a real treat. Also, the booklet included with the set is full of cool photos and details.
B004J4RQIM|5.0|I saw this concert originally on a PBS special. David Foster is pure musical genius! This concert is packed with several top name artists and the song choices were awesome. Really brings you back. I didn't even realize that David Foster either wrote and/or produced so many hits that we either grew up with or hits of today. Point blank, this was an awesome concert! looks great on BluRay... and you won't be disappointed. If you love music in general, you'll love this dvd.
B0050I2PQE|5.0|The documentary is very well done and interesting with vintage clips and current interviews with Glenn Hughes and Jon Lord. It is a great account of the Deep Purple Mk IV era and I highly recommend it to any hardcore Deep Purple fans, especially Mk III and IV fans. The concert DVD is also very nice with the opportunity to see pro-shot footage of the highly talented collection of Coverdale, Hughes, Bolin, Lord and Paice together.
0316098329|5.0|One of the best and easiest read books I have read in a long time. It portrays a real love between son and mother and expresses how a child, who never knoew different, could feel safe and secure in an 11 X 11 room. This book is utterly thrilling, heartwarming, charming, and captivating... I could not keep this book out of my hands for very long and now that I am done and I am still reminicing and left wanting more. A must read!!!!
B0052UZIFA|5.0|The funnest game I&apos;ve ever played, countless hours of entertainment! I hope they release a new version.  This game is a must have!
B001GAOY5U|3.0|This film is an odd combination of adventure and comedy, aimed directly at a kids' audience rather than a deeper film that adults might enjoy as well.  It is fantastical, full of coincidences and miraculous survivals, and in the end completely unbelievable for hard scifi fans.  That being said, it does have some of its own magic and my kids absolutely loved it for a rollicking fun ride, even if for us, the parents, it was mere background noise.  Recommended.

1463514581|5.0|Denise Grover Swank is on tour with CLP Blog Tours, and I am sure glad she is! I could not put down Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes. I started it at eight in the morning, and by eight that night I was already 67% finished- and I worked a full day! I kept pulling my Kindle out whenever I got a free minute because I couldn't stand not knowing what would happen next. The main character is Rose Gardner, a twenty-four year old woman who seems more like she is a young teen from her sheltered life she has been forced to live. Her `Momma' has been a controlling, overbearing, and quite selfish mother, and Rose's life revolves around keeping Momma happy.  Rose also has visions, often pretty mundane things like where someone misplaced their keys, but is shaken one day when she sees a vision of herself- dead. Instead of her vision coming true, her Momma ends up dead, and Rose is considered a suspect. Now, Rose has to figure out how to live life on her own, how to clear her name, and how to figure out the delicious next door neighbor Joe, who always comes to her rescue but seems to be hiding a secret.<br /><br />Rose's character is super sweet yet painfully shy and seriously clueless about the world. She makes a bucket list when she sees the vision of herself dead, thinking that she doesn't have much time left. The things she wants to experience are what many take for granted: play in the rain, get a cell phone, get cable TV, kiss a man. It's a little heartbreaking to read about such a nice person who has lived her life under such tight constraints. I was friends with Rose from page one. The story only gets better as you read on, full of twists and gasping moments and a sweet love story that I wasn't sure how was going to turn out until the last chapter. This is the debut from Denise Grover Swank, and I know she has three more in the series in the works, and I absolutely cannot wait to read them. Twenty-Eight and a Half Wishes has easily topped my Favorites for 2011, and I highly suggest this Southern mystery for your bookshelf, it will not disappoint!t this Southern mystery for your bookshelf, it will not disappoint!
1439107955|5.0|This magnificent book brought together all the piecemeal science articles I have read over many years into a coherent, exciting, hard-to-put-down story.

0596804822|1.0|This book is pretty worthless when the first code project won't even compile. Hours wasted reading and painstakingly coding through the first 20 some odd pages and even more hours wasted on internet forums trying to find out what the heck is going on with the errors you and everyone else is getting. Even after the fixes, still  the same silly errors. Maybe the author compiled in an old version of XCode, but in XCode 4, the code just won't compile. I don't know if it's this guy's fault or Apple's fault, but bottom line, the code won't work.     You'd do yourself a favor to look elsewhere for your OpenGL/IOS needs because this ain't it.
0307120007|5.0|Pat the Bunny is a \\"must have\\" classic children's book. The multisensory format makes it especially appealing to young children.

I love this DVD, it's a great quick workout, it's effective, and it's affordable.  Level 2 has come to be my favorite because it makes my back feel amazing.  The 30 Day Shred is a challenging workout, but it's totally worth the sweat and soreness!

But I have nothing but admiration for Jaycee's courage and her desire to help others through the sale of this book.

1451626657|4.0|Catch-22 tells the story of Yossarian, the only 'sane' man in his flight squandron (and possibly entire army.) Yo-Yo wants out of the war, and away from his superiors' endless raising of the required number of flight missions per person. Unfortunately his best hope is proving that he's crazy - but no-one crazy would want out of the army right? Catch-22!<br /><br />The novel is pretty heavy going, given the prose is like endless catch-22 jokes, and Heller has fun throwing the timeline around, frequently jumping out of scenes and scrambling the book almost beyond anything close to linear. Things get a little easier after page 200, and around page 400 we finally get chapters that stick to one time segment...<br /><br />Heller doesn't bother with typical plot-drivers like understandable/likeable characters, and has no compunction about driving his creations from the heights of euphoria to the deepest pits of despair.<br /><br />Surprisingly in amongst this mess, are some of the most vivid enthralling scenes I've ever read, especially the climatic flight scene towards the end, and I almost wonder if the intention of the novel is to build up to Heller showing off his literary skills for this one moment.<br /><br />Of course there is meaning to this novel - aside from mocking the military, Heller comments on human nature, particularly our contrary natures. With its moral depravity, and nothing changes stance, in many ways Catch-22 can be a depressing read, but also a bizarre ride, that one is better for at the end.

B004LWZVZC|3.0|The Conspirator, a Robert Redford film, covers the aftermath of President Lincoln's assassination. The focus of this film is the trial of the conspirators, with special treatment on Mrs. Mary Surratt.    Mary Surratt was a widow of property who had difficulty running a small farm, stage stop inn, and post office after the death of her husband. At the time of Lincoln's murder, she has leased the Surrattville properties and moved into Washington City (Washington, DC). She runs a boarding house. Mrs. Surratt had three children--two sons, Issaac and John and one daughter, Anna, who was actually a 13 year old girl at the time of Lincoln's murder.    Issaac has grown up and is out of the picture in terms of actual events and the world of this film. John is shown as a comrade and fellow plotter with John Wilkes Booth and the others. Anna is made older than John and somewhat self sufficient in this film.    The characters of Surratt's boarder and her inn manager/postmaster are closely drawn from the historic record. The boarder was miffed with Mrs. Surratt for butting into other boarders' business and attempting to usurp Mrs. Surratt's authority in her establishment. The stage stop inn manager was a drunk who stole from Mrs. Surratt. One point in the film that is obvious on reading the historical accounts is that the police fixed on Mrs. Surratt when Lewis Payne showed up one to two nights after the assassination looking for help; to that point, the police seemed satisfied that Mrs. Surratt was merely the mother of one alleged suspect, John and of no interest. The appearance at her boarding house changed all of that. The police detained both Mrs. Surratt and Anna for suspicion in President Lincoln's death.    Edwin Stanton is portrayed here more as a cutout than a fully developed character. The real life Stanton was obstinate, combative, paranoid, and rash and out to preserve Stanton as opposed to preserving the Union. Presumably, he kept Vice President Johnson from exercising his authority due to Lincoln's mortal wound. Further, do keep in mind that Stanton eventually controlled all the evidence and access to the conspirators and witnesses. Most persons seeing the film or even reading the accounts of the assassination may wonder why the President had no military guards or even a reliable police guard--He did have Major Rathbone who replaced General Grant who declined to attend Ford's Theatre with Lincoln; his valet; and Constable Parker of the Washington Metropolitan Police. Parker left his post and had drinks at a nearby bar, returned and took a seat in the dress circle, abandoning his chair by the door to the President's box because he couldn't see anything of the play. Stanton would not allow his chief telegrapher, a burly Army officer to accompany Lincoln, nor was he too keen on having Grant attend the theatre either.     I think that the film works more as an overview of the trial and the manner of its conduct than for the spirit of the times. When Lincoln was shot, the North was celebrating the surrender of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia and the tension, stress, and anxiety of the shooting war was somewhat abated. In so far as I have read about Mary Surratt, she never publicly mentioned any Southern sympathy. If anything, Surratt was ambivalent.    In real life the overreaching Stanton caught a kick in the seat of his pants, courtesy of a Senate and House delegation regarding the case of Anna Surratt. Most would be shocked to hear that the girl was being held in a cell apart from her mother and without the intervention would have been turned into a co-conspirator and tried with the rest of them.    A set of facts were glossed over: the tremendous uproar of the verdict against Mrs. Surratt with the death penalty. Numerous persons protested by telegram and some letters. One of the more prominent calls for a stay of execution came from Pope Leo XIII whose telegram was personally delivered by the Papal Legate andNuncio to President Andrew Johnson.    The film suggests that Mrs. Surratt's co-defendants had no attorneys speaking for them at the trial. This was not true. Mr. Aiken and the other defense counsels did their best against the rules of the court martial. Made some points and kept four of the conspirators from being hanged.     The film does a good job of showing how some conspirators actually had no real participation in the assassination. For example, Ed Spangler was a stage hand who held Booth's horse. Spangler had no idea that Booth would kill President Lincoln. Next, George Atzerodt, though a conspirator, never followed up on trying to kill Vice President Johnson. Instead, he had drinks in the hotel bar and left for his brother's home. He was not well off, had no horse, and walked the distance. He probably should have gotten a jail sentence rather than the hangman's rope.    Mary Surratt's crime was \\"having the nest that contained the assassins.\\" I do know that Surratt was never in the same room when the conspirators discussed their plans, nor was the boarder in much proximity--he was pretty much ignored by Booth and company.    As for John Surratt, Booth's friend and young prodigy, he was not present for the assassination because he had traveled to Canada probably on a mission for the Confederate Secret Service. Eventually, he served in the papal army under an assumed name and finally returned to the United States about 7 - 12 years after the assassination. He was not convicted on the same evidence as the four hanged conspirators which included his mother.    As a starting place for the events immediately prior to, during, and after the assassination, The Conspirator does a merely satisfactory job. I did not like the license taken with Anna Surratt. The real life Anna was a child and in great peril until the intervention by the Senate-House delegation. More should have been presented on Edwin Stanton's usurpation of executive authority; control, manipulation,and tampering with evidence and witnesses and his subversion of due process and his confrontation with President Johnson that caused Johnson to fire Stanton after Johnson was acquitted at his impeachment trial which had been orchestrated in part by Edwin Stanton.
0143038419|5.0|I read the book \\"Eat,Pray,Love\\" while I was on my way to and coming back from, my first trip to India. It was the perfect book for me to read as it introduced me so well to the culture of that magnificently diverse country. Elizabeth Gilbert writes beautifully and I felt like I was really there, even before I actually was. Then when I returned home to the states, I couldn't wait to see the movie of it with Julia Roberts. Again, I felt like I was right back in India. Highly recommended,especially if you don't have the opportunity to actually travel to India, you will still feel like you have had a delicious \\"taste\\" of India.
0439023513|4.0|I have been possessed by this trilogy for the last few days: I haven't been able to put it down. I think I loved 'Mockingjay' most of all.     *SPOILERS*  Flawed:  There were times I found the storytelling kind of unfocused , like the long sequence in the Capitol; the 'pods' and the underground tunnels in the long battle sequence were very 'fuzzy' to me, with not enough physical details to add texture to the scenes. I sometimes felt that the author left me with a 'sketch' rather than a fully painted picture of what she wanted me to see. Also, some of the characters were very flat, simply there to serve a purpose, like the prep team for the comic relief.    Beautiful:  Flawed, unpredictable main characters, especially Katniss. I admired the author's courage in leading the reader to sometimes feel ambivalent about her main character.    The love triangle was what pulled me into the story and kept me reading. Katniss' ambivalence about her own feelings suited her character and her youth. I loved the dance between the characters, and the way the writer kept Katniss balanced on that narrow edge: are her feelings 'real' or 'not real'? I appreciated the writer's choice to make those words part of the dialogue in the last book, with a tiny, but lovely payoff between Peeta and Katniss at the end.      The ending was moving, painful, small and beautiful: after what the characters had been through, a big ol' Happily Ever After would have felt false to me.

B0058OUJA4|2.0|I am not sure which one came first this or Hex Defense. Although this game is fun I give it two stars for ripping off another developers hard work and creativity. If I&apos;m wrong that this game was first than disregard this. This should not even be the free app because it is so much like Hex Defense. Amazon should not be advertising two apps that are THE SAME GAME. I&apos;m not sure who selects apps but its almost as if they pick them out of a hat.
