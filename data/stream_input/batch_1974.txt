1451695195|5.0|A very interesting a stimulating book by someone with a lot of expertise in functions of the brain. A must read for all doubters.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|A thought provoking gem.  Clint Eastwood is better as he ages, here showing the guilelessness in representing the old fashioned and better way of doing things.  The very problem with corporations, the greed of selfish people, represented by the lawyers, showing true colors, who do not get it, is well shown.  A beautiful story told very well about imperfect people who found their way through perseverance, and love.
0307951529|5.0|This is really one of the best entrepreneurship books I've read in a long time. It offers a lot of good, real and workable ideas. Too many books on entrepreneurship are full of ideas or tips that aren't workable or usable for the average person with a full time job who can't afford to quit their job in order to get started. This book is full of ideas that are doable for these kinds of people. It also full of stories and examples of people who have done it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Overall, this a fun and addicting game. However, I do not know how to switch facebook accounts. I logged in once but I want to use a different account how do I do that?!?!
0385344333|5.0|I just finished reading this book yesterday.  I have a friend that can't wait to get it  II have read all of the Jack Reacher novels and I will be waiting for the next one!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put the Kitchen House down! It kept me engaged from the first page until the last; written similarly to The Help, it was brilliant.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|A friend told me to read these books and said they were as good as Fifty Shades of Grey and I totally agree!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I am not a techie, so this app gives me the information I need to make my unit available when I want to use it.  This developer seems to have the customer in mind.  THANX.
B009NPKTN6|3.0|This movie was just ok to me. I will probably never watch it again. The best part was hearing all of the songs!
B0098VYCCE|1.0|**contains spoilers**<br />Many reviewers have mentioned Kristin Stewart's emotionless acting as a reason for rating this movie poorly. While I agree wholeheartedly with that assessment of Stewart's \\"insert main character here\\" moments on screen, I venture farther than that to say that the ultimate flaw in this film is the script.  While the plot is innovative and moves rapidly, the dialogue leaves much to be desired. Lines are often mumbled or seem out of place, breaking the scene's flow. For example, when Stewart says in the final scene to the queen \\"you cannot have my heart\\" it makes you wonder whether Snow is a little dim witted. Considering that Snow has just raised an army, brawled her way through the castle, and stabbed the queen, it is obvious that the Queen cannot have Snow's heart to claim victory for the bad guys. She is also unlikely to convince Snow to order her a pizza or fold her laundry, yet the script writers thankfully left those pieces of redundancy on the editing room floor. I found myself laughing through most of this movie a la Mystery Science Theater 3000. As the credits rolled, I felt as through I had just sat through a high school play, complete with unnecessary angst, awkward timing, and overacted mediocre lines. I do not recommend this film unless you are looking for something to laugh at with friends and mass quantities of alcohol.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I've been  using my cell as an alarm clock for 5 years. One day, I left it at work so I downloaded this to my kindle fire. Now I use this as my alarm!
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book will strike a chord in anyone who has truly loved another person. It embodies love, passion, greed, guilt and anguish all at once, and will keep you turning each page eagerly.
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Very smooth and enjoyable! Whether you are a Rod Stewart fan or not, you will enjoy this music. Greta for dinner parties or just chilling alone at home.
B009X01C64|4.0|This is a very nice case with a genuine leather feel. I only wish that Marware thought out the design better and had put a snap or velcro like they put in the Vibe 8.9, to keep the Fire HD 8.9 device section attached to the cover so that it would not dangle open and accidentally hang down. I am going to keep this cover but get some self stick velcro and stick it on the back of the Kindle device section to solve the dangling problem. Marware, please fix this so that our Fire HDs don't have an accident.<br /><br />I also agree with another reviewer about the hand strap. It's so wide that it's clumsy, uncomfortable and inconvienent; it's not very useful. And the strap is only usable in portrait mode. I find that the Fire HD 8.9 screen content looks better in the landscape mode, so that's the way I hold it 100% of the time.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I read both book 1 and 2 to decide for myself whether it was too risky and crossed an invisible line.  I wasn't offended by the lifestyle because it was two consenting adults.  With that said, I could have put this book down after the first couple of chapters.  The rest of the story seemed irrelevant to me.  I became tired of the main female character's contradictions and redundant internal argument.  The story had potential to be better then the norm.  I applaud the author for compelling me to go outside of my comfort zone and to look at the lifestyle depicted without prejudice.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is a game, and should always be free to play as long as you want. Why are Bingo developers so greedy to charge you after you run out of your daily credits. You never win anything physically, yet you have to pay real money to keep enjoying the game.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|nice free app.  smooth on the ipad.  very glitchy on fire. still playing so it can not be that bad
B002M9WW30|4.0|These movies are great, except for Rocky 5.  What a pile of poo that movie turned out to be.  Remarkably they where able to make up for it with the newest last one.  If you buy these, just throw out 5 and then enjoy the awesome that is Rocky!
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|This season was more hype than substance. They had better do better for season 3. Very much a waste of money.
B009FOBZL0|4.0|This is my first wallflowers album I've ever purchased, and I like it .  I've only ever really heard their radio singles and thought they were fine.  This album is pretty upbeat and fun.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A good and fast read as are most of Nicholas Sparks books, nice to have an author that keeps it clean enough for most ages.
1449417051|5.0|The book is tiny and you will be done with it in 20 minutes. So consider if it's worth your money. I think the price should be closer to $3 for the amount of the information that the book contains but it is a funny book and I don't regret buying it. I even later bought a corresponding calendar for my friend as we are both cat lovers.
8866130885|5.0|Love the subtle text treatment on the cover.<br />And the artwork on the endleaves.<br />I also like the fact that there is a lined page beside every calendar week (although a plain page would rock more).<br />I am not a Star Wars fan but it I was it would be one of the coolest things to add to the collection.
0345536886|5.0|Excellent book by Grisham at his finest.  The cast of characters and story line in this book were very funny.
0451196716|5.0|It's been a long time since I've read a book that I became so engrossed in that I couldn't sleep, couldn't talk, couldn't move. I had to finish it. The whole book was amazing. The ending was slightly dissapointing, but I very much so enjoyed the book. It is one of those rare books that shows you life and death all to clear.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Every song has you wanting more , the lyrics are relative to everyday life & they take you on a musical journey. I truly recommend this album.
B0083ZRAJS|3.0|I had to remember through out that this was written for children. I have seen the movie so many times, I had a hard time getting some of the story's images.
0446554995|5.0|Preston and Child (separately or together) always give great bang for the buck. Pendergast is legend... can't wait until his next adventure
B007SGLZP8|3.0|This doesn't quite measure up to the other Grisham novels. It borders on fantasy the way the whole thing comes together. There are some good twists and turns though.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I've never met anyone who's read Ender's Game and been able to walk away from it. I read it as a young person, and a few times since. I've given it to my son and The Ender's Game phenomenon is being passed anew through the local teenagers -- a rebirth of sorts. A good book, well written, never dies. It just lies in wait to ensnare a new reader. We readers wouldn't have it any other way. Clean enough for all advanced readers, even primary aged children; yet a gripping, exciting read for every adult I know.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I completely love this game. I knew going in that I would like it since I played [[ASIN:B00356GVRW Persona 3 Portable]] on the PSP and thought it was fun, but I didn't expect to enjoy this game anywhere near as much as I did. The characters and their stories are really well written and feel very personal, the personalities of the characters are pretty consistent, and your party members aren't one dimensional pieces of cardboard. The voice acting is pretty good (if annoying with certain characters) and the music is great.<br /><br />Let's be honest, though: The Vita doesn't have many great titles yet and a lot of people are trading in their consoles because no one is making good games, developers aren't putting games out because no one is buying the console, and I completely understand the logic behind both of those decisions. However, before you give up on the Vita (if in fact you are planning on giving up on the Vita) you've gotta get this game. Play through it and then rethink your plan to ditch the Vita. Games like P4G don't have a home at Nintendo, what with the more mature themes, swearing, and all. If we don't support good games like this, they'll disappear and that would really suck.<br /><br />Also, if you're wondering which of the Vita's features this games uses the answer is almost none. No rear touch screen, no camera (front or back), and the front touch screen control is only used for optional things like accessing/navigating the \\"TV Browser\\", using the \\"SOS\\" and \\"Talk\\" functions (\\"SOS\\" is a free heal/mana restore at the beginning of combat, \\"Talk\\" allows you to see what other players do when at the same point). If you just wanted the Vita to be a more powerful PSP with a second analog stick, you're getting your wish here. I hope more developers decide that they don't have to use every single gimmick Sony put on the Vita.<br /><br />In short, if you've got a Vita: Buy this. If you don't have a Vita, you should wait until more games come out, then buy a Vita, then buy this.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was better than I had expected. Looking forward to the next book in the series before the movie is released.
B0096PYUE2|1.0|Product stops working all the time; I should have read the reviews before downloading! Hoping that Adobe and Amazon can kiss and make up...
B000V7J82S|5.0|I really really love this lp. has a bunch of Marley's Best. this vinyl sounds great, looks great, came in great packaging.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I went on my Facebook app and found that all the post was from 5 days ago. Couple of weeks ago l was able to rearrange the post to most recent but now I can't find that option. It's under &quot;most important&quot; . It's not most important. I don't care what happened 5 days ago because it happened 5 days ago and I want to see what's happening now.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I literally couldn't put this book down once I started it!  It kept me guessing and wanting more!  Besides Katniss of course, rue  was my favorite character.
B009C7ZQM4|3.0|it dosen't suck but I also can't really tell if it is actualy doing anything, I wish it would let me clear off all my old apps of my kindle that i uninstauled.
B00AEFVRB2|3.0|Well acted well scripted ,tense and gritty leaves you wondering can families really be this dysfunctional. If you are looking for a feel good movie stay away.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|all the artists who contributed to this exbiting alterna-pop album couldn't have been any biter! an outstanding concluding soundtrack makes for an outstanding concluding film!
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Firefly fans will love this movie. Even if you have never watched the series, this movie is a great story. Great SciFi work.
B00008G8LF|5.0|i've always been infatuated with history. i used to own this but again it got lost. now i own it for a second time and on dvd this time which makes this movie even better and the screen clearer!
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|Not what I expected. writing tablet could be better and clearer in the clarity department. Other aspects of the tablets  are fair.
B000TM1CL0|5.0|what a shark with what a mouth! sebastian is the life of the show. he's a shark of a lawyer! no nonsence, no questions, point blank, down and dirty!
B004XJHBCE|1.0|It should have said up front that it does not work on the Kindle. I guess they just want your money and don't care if the app works or not. This is a bad practice and I would avoid the maker of this app.
B001ED7C58|5.0|thats what this cd is! hayley williams was very inspired in the lyrics and the composing of her song title track ''decode''. it completely sums up the first stages of a vampire/human romance. forbidden fruit.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I love this game. I just love it. I love having to play against friends and drawing period!  Me and my boy friend LOVE to play this game. OMG POP did a amazing app and if you want to play against me my user name is tigerslashdragon.
B00004RFFS|5.0|anne rice your debut novel bites in a good way! it bit me! i wish lestat were real! he's soooooo sexy! he's this vampire who wasn't given a choice to become a bloodsucker but he dealt with it very well. he acts like a monster but he isn't one. he's complicated and he wants someone to relate to. if i were a vampire i'd feel sorry for him. he deserves sympathy he was never given. but in the second book, his autobiography, he's really underneath a charachter who deserves some sympathy.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I enjoy the fast pace of this 3D puzzle. Like a twisted mahjong game. Time challenges and racing the oncoming blocks. Its all fun.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|For a free app this is tremendous. Lots of free levels. I play this on my phone, My tablet and my PC. Very addictive game.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Watch this series just for Maggie Smith.  She is really just getting better and better.  Give her more lines, for goodness sake.<br /><br />I agree with all those who say this is a glorified, high cost-costume soap opera, stories that go no where or resolve a little too neatly and characters who are just too internally consistent.<br /><br />The visuals owe a lot to Mad Men and the advent of high definition screens.<br /><br />We are allowed to have a guilty pleasure.
B004U8VWLE|2.0|I really like this actress Natalie Portman, but the script was hopeless!  No one could have made this movie believable!!
B000I3UMKM|5.0|A strength of a movie is measured by how much I remember 15, 20, 25 years later.<br /><br />This movie I saw only once in the mid 1990s, and I remember so much of it: the Moon River song, the Kansan ex husband, the gigolo, the mole...<br /><br />It is really haunting.<br /><br />Too bad the movie in typical Hollywood style changes the ending from tragic to happy all ok, in denigration of the original Truman Capote book on which it is based.<br /><br />Also very typical Hollywood: racist, unfunny Japanese man portrayed in yellowface by Mickey Rooney.  That part was disgusting.  It was, \\"let's depict the humanity of the beautiful white female low social class prostitute, but let's stereotype the Asian man.\\"<br /><br />Despite this huge flaw and handicap, it is still a great movie, that's just how good it is.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great way to pass time keeps my mind active. Told all my family and friends to try it. Just want to win more.
B00A7Z8KAU|5.0|So here is my 3rd ever review. Most apps I get I uninstall pretty much immediately after I use it. So for me to even take the time to do this should alone say something.<br /><br />Ok, I'm not good at drawing and in no way can I make a cool pic. Like the app shows you can BUT, I do see it being possible. I'm new to the art world and just fooling around with this app is fun. I know nothing about layers as some other reviews talk about but I'm sure I'll figure it out soon. I had the app on my phone and liked it so I put the pro version on my kindle fire HD. This app is amazing. I feel like I need lessons because of the options your given. You can make any color,sharp,design and on an  on. I have played with this app for a few hrs now and in my opinion 5$ for 2 or 3 hrs of entertainment so far is cheaper than anything else I pay for to have fun. All in all its worth it even if ur like me and SUCK at drawing.<br /><br />Mr.banger5150
0375851569|5.0|After bringing my children up on Dr. Suess I had to start a library for my grandson. This is a two fold win as I get to re-read his books that I enjoyed doing then and will enjoy now. Life can be so simple.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's Solitaire. Nothing special about it. I mean I really fif not want it I just was getting use to the Kindle and accidentally clicked on it.
B005ZUR724|5.0|Five star game. Worth the eight dollars. Another  outstanding game from gameloft<br />. Requires a decent amount of apace and you need a good internet connection.
B000035Z3K|5.0|If you love Dracula you should own this classic. Forget the blood & gore; dialog, atmosphere and creepy aura make this a wonderful classic and must-own.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Ever girls dream.....kept you wanting more and more. Glad it kept me excited and wanting to find out how it ended, couldn't put it down. Great book.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|hey thanks for comments saying that this game could cost more than $120 . because my little sister want this game and shes clumsy.  my mom would be upset if she had to pay that money.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|DIDNT MEAN TO GET IT NEVER USED IT SO IM GETTING RID OF IT SO I CANT GIVE U AN ANSWER ON IT SORRY
B008K6HN8I|3.0|Positive that now i can take a picture with my Kindle camera.<br />Negative that it requires too many clicks to get to the camera app. and then one cannot save it to favorites.<br /><br />suggestion for amazon kindle: make a tiny mirror that you can attach to kindle hd that substitutes as a viewer so that you can see what you are taking photo of.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I chose it because it is a good dictionary for me.Yes yes yes  Yes yes yes yes yes yes yes.
B00913DPW2|3.0|Unable to give an adequete assessment of this game as i did not play it enough to make an evaluation
B008O9V4C2|3.0|This album, along with the other Fagen solo albums made me realize how much Walter Becker adds to Steely Dan.
B004GYY714|4.0|Great and easy to use. Search is easy to us. One can use it while driving; plugging kindle into car.
1426209584|5.0|The two authors dedicated years of their lives to photographing, videographing and studying the habits of all 39 accepted species of Birds of Paradise.  In doing so, they hit a home run. The book is worth it just for the photos. The reader looking for deeper knowledge of this interesting group of birds will be thrilled with information obtained. Perhaps, the best nature book I have ever read!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel App is quick and accurate. Looks stunning on iPad mini. User can set up multiple locations to check daily weather. Well thought out app.
B00407PNY2|1.0|WEll, if a film is gonna be remembered for only one type of scene, in this case, the classic car chase; well, that film is not a good one. It usually happens when one sees \\"old\\" films with \\"new\\" eyes......it's just not fun anymore...almost like playing with toys from our teenage time....today we have much better toys to play with.  The plot, the acting, the dialogues...well, they just did'nt make it for me, sorry. I was extremely bored, no surprises, just plain lame. On the plus side, I got the dvd fairly cheap, so money was not an important issue. SKIP IT!!!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|My husband and I visited our daughter in Pittsburgh. We asked if she and her friends wanted to do something during the night. They wanted to see \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower.\\" At first I didn't think I was going to like the movie. In the end I enjoyed the movie. My daughter told me that she had read the book, and the book was better. So I had to get the book.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|Interesting perspective to take life through the point of view of a pet.  It gives an added understanding to why we connect with our pets the way we do.  The plot is interesting and the racing metaphor works well.
B007SAKSF2|5.0|Exquisite packaging of each Blur album combined with the accompanying Bsides from the album on Disc 2. The best British band since The Smiths. Also includes link to downloads of all music to spare you from physically ripping each disc. Very helpful.
B008DYZKQE|4.0|An up-to-date twist of princes stories, with a positive, likable, strong girl character. The only complaint I'd have is that the story is quite short.
B008O9V24W|4.0|This album opens with 4 of the most catchy, high-octane tunes of the year. I promise they will get stuck in your head. Along with the refrain in Aftershave Ocean. One of the best UK releases of 2012.
B0083SBJXS|1.0|I have no problem with the product that I know of short of the fact that I still don't have it. It was supposed to arrive on December 15... It's January 12. This was going to be a Christmas present but that idea is dead and gone now thanks to amazon. I called, seven days after it was supposed to be delivered and they told me that I'm overreacting and simply need to wait one or two days longer. Lo and behold, I'm still short an avengers DVD. I found out that it was actually being shipped from my zip code. I called up amazon, fed-ex and the post office and asked them why it takes ten days to ship something from one end of a town to the other. Amazon and fed-ex just passed the buck along saying \\"I can't do anything about that\\". The post office employee spent half an hour working with me though sadly he didn't get anywhere either. All I can say is that I have a whole new outlook on Amazon; people who can't help you if their system screws up. Thanks amazon, for robbing my girlfriend of a great Christmas present.
B0098WWEH8|5.0|A friend of mine kept trying to get me into this band, and I have no idea why I pushed back for so long.  I am now looking forward to explore the rest of their catalog, as this release is pretty much perfect from start to finish.  2012 was an icredible year for music, to say the least.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|What can I say? It does everything you would want an alarm clock to and it is super easy to set up and use.
B009YU6FJM|4.0|I'm not a huge Deftones fan, but I enjoy this disc.  This isn't my typical genre of music, so unfortunately I don't have much else to say.  I imagine that fans of the band's previous works would enjoy this one.
B009POCG0Y|3.0|I accidently bought this R-rated version, not realizing that the theatrical version was rated NC-17.  I prefer to buy the theatrical version of films, and wish there had been some information about what scenes were deleted to make this DVD into an R-rated version.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am now addicted to Downton Abbey and will be watching every Sunday night.  I watched the first season on nexflix and bought the 2nd season.
B0091X4HQA|5.0|This is a great movie. It's full of suspense, great acting, and great drama. There's even some humor. This is just one of those movies that I'll sit down and watch over and over again.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I like the app but what really makes me mad is THAT U CAN ONLY USE THE NETHER REACTOR ONCE ):(<br />Please make it reusable
B007THA4FI|1.0|I only read half but I found the story to be slow, uninteresting, hard to follow, lowbrow, and all of the major characters are boringly fiercely crazy.  The story is more boring and uninteresting than real life.
B004UID2LC|1.0|Is it me?  I love youtube but don't like this app.  I don't find what I am looking for on this app.  I can't stop finding what I want on youtube on my computer. please help.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This was a great movie. I love Johnny Depp. It was sent in a great amount of time. Watched several times.
1451695195|1.0|He was NOT brain dead...no one has come back from brain death.<br />He should know this better than anyone.<br />Because he can remember this story, means that the memory is IN his<br />PHYSICAL mind. The impression was made on his ACTIVE brain.<br />If your heart stops beating...you are not dead.<br />You are not dead until you are brain dead.<br />He was not dead.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This game is of the hook.I enjoy when I play with my sister.They should think about a second one where it has all levels sepratly.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This is really fun than all the DS games they have made so far , because it is interactive. Yay!
0399157565|5.0|Cornwell is addictive.  Read all she has done.  This is among her very best. Flawed people can do much good -her characters show that  quality in real, human terms.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is easy at first but can be challenging in the later levels, fun to play for adults as well as kids.
B000W93CHC|5.0|This book complimented Pillars of the Earth, even though could have read this withoout reading Pillars of the Earth. People had such a hard life back then.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Gameplay progresses according to disease types, but the actual game experience is somewhat monotonous. There are a few strategies that almost always work, and once you learn them the game is usually pretty easy.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Slow at first, bu then it picks up. i'm hoping the next ones are better than the first, showing more about the characters.
B009JBZH54|5.0|It ia an excelent package of movies  i like this . . . . . . . .  . .
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is the most addicting game ever l love it. I can play for 5<br />hours strait. I wish I could give it 10 stars.

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This game I can play for hours.This game is a very fun game and I just sit down and play it all the time.
B006GHA9VQ|5.0|This is a good movie, i like it, i love the phantom of the opera movies . . . .
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|So many pop culture and 80's references on each page of the book, it will make you feel both nostalgic and eager to finish the book straight on.<br />When you are done with the book you 'll have the need to plug in your old Atari system back on and enjoy some Joust!
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|This is a Excelent movie, i like it, i love the phantom of the opera movies . . . .
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book is hard to put down. Well written and with a great imagination. Good for both kids and adults.
B0013ND30W|1.0|I understand I bought a set of used discs, but I don't feel a disc that is scratched so badly it wouldn't play, is not acceptable.  I know the scratch was there when we received it because it was visible when we went to play it.  Very disappointing.<br />We didnt send it back because the other disc worked fine and returning it would have been very time consuming and would have cost more in gas than the DVD was worth.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Blake Crouch is a wonderful writer the book was so good could wait to get to the next page. it kept you guessing the whole way throught the story.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I got this game a few weeks ago and I love  it. This game has cute animals and pretty good graphics. It is probably one of my favorite games  on my kindle fire. I really recommend this app!  :)
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|on my Kindle Fire HD the game only works in one horizontal mode which requires it different in my case than all others.  This is a bit of a hassle.  Otherwise it is OK.
1469984202|5.0|I purchased this omnibus edition because of the great reviews on Amazon and was definitely not disappointed.  This is the best new SF I have read in a long time - intriguing story, great characters, I just couldn't put it down until finished.  Have since been given a Kindle and have now read the prequel Shift Series, also highly recommended, these novellas provide further insights into the story of the Silos.  Looking forward to reading more from this author.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Must see movie. Fat Amy is perfect in this movie. I was dying laughing throughout this film. I have no favorite parts because there were too many.
030758836X|3.0|I really thought this would be a smart, interesting thriller.  I did not find it to be so.  To me, it was predictable and the stuff of old tv movies.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|Complicated story. Dozens of characters. Very detailed, plausible universe.<br /><br />Good read.<br /><br />Just a little too long and the ending was a little random.
0765325950|5.0|Pre-Ordered and got the book, read it, finished it. No spoilers here.<br />It was a great end to the story, tying together many characters from previous books (who appeared in some books, then disappeared). Full of suspense, but not predictable (i.e. if you want to predict before you read who will live/die, you cant).<br />Overall a nice book, added to my library.<br />I have all the Jordan books - only 2 of them were such poor books, I'm glad I didn't buy them new, but got them used.<br />Like other readers, I would have preferred to buy on Kindle, but can't wait for it to be released.<br /><br />There are some random new chars.<br />Also, although this completes the series, some open hooks are left for sequels or side stories...
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This movie was exactly how I expected it to be. Kind of stupid and predictable, but still kind of funny and entertaining.<br /><br />Come on folks, it's about a bear who smokes pot.
B007ME5BUG|5.0|Beevor presents a concise history of WWII providing global and temporal perspective.  The book is heavy on military strategy and world suffering, but also presents a world economic picture that helps answer the question why.<br /><br />The reader would do well to have an accompanying set of maps (the provided ones are a bit thin) and good understanding of military terminology, equipment, ranks, and unit nomenclature.  It would also be helpful to understand some of the political interactions between regular military, political leaders, and the state security apparatus.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Was really excited about the movie, as it had a great reviews. Found it hard to follow and was pretty confused at different points.<br /><br />Joseph Gordon Levitt's wore a bunch of makeup to make him look more like Bruce Willy. I thought it just looked weird, added to my confusion.<br /><br />Took me a while afterwards to figure out what happened. I always struggle to wrap my head around movies about time travel.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Lets me know exactly what I need, without a lot of stuff I don`t want or need. Simple to set up and customize too!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Good movie, very entertaining, very hollywood.<br /><br />Loved Bane, he made the movie for me, thought his voice was hilarious.<br /><br />This one, like the last batman was way too long. Caught a quick nap in the middle of it and woke up for the end. Didn't feel like I missed anything.
B008O9V4C2|3.0|I have been a Steely Dan and Donald Fagen fan since 1979.  This purchase was the first time I ever regretted buying his work.  First, I was disappointed with the cheap packaging, however, I expect cheap packaging to become the norm as CDs are phased out.  Second, none of the songs were memorable.  In the past, his albums have always had songs that I wanted to listen to repeatedly.  None this time.  In fact, I stopped it from auto repeating after the last song.  I want to know where is Donald Fagen?  This sounded Fagen-inspired, but not Fagen.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|It started out like we wouldn't like but it was a great movie.  There are some things to be learned from this.  Loved it
B008XG1X18|5.0|Im thrilled that they now have a pinterest app for the kindle fire. The ease of use with the app is wonderful.
B00992CF6W|5.0|We got this for my boys for Christmas to load on their tablets. They love this game and spend hours playing it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|this is grate not sure why people are complaint about this app.  not enough words to post my review.well now I can
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have experienced the two most intense days of my life. I was brought back to my sad and hurtful childhood as well as my most wonderful years as I fell in love foe the first time. This book gave me the opportunity to look into my life with different eyes and remember and recount my most wonderful memories. Thanks so very much, I just wish I could do over my life and not lost so much of myself with anger. I love you IF wherever you are, will always love you. Can't live with or without you.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Great fun. This is an entertaining for adults and children alike. Always different challenges. and changes in the game to keep you interested.  I enjoy it.
B000IZXR7U|3.0|It is supposed to be a post apocalypses story but was really only about what things were like on the roads.  Very narrow story line.  In the end it is like all Mel Gibson movies based on revenge.  Boooorrrring!!!!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I always finish a book, regardless how much I can't get into it.  However, I put this book down halfway through.  The descriptions of a heavenly experience were nearly non-existent and what was explained left a bad taste in my mouth.  This writer emphasized more on his achievements professionally and the minute aspects if his injury.  I'm sorry I bought the book....no proof if heaven was evident.
B0047WJ12K|4.0|I love movies that get really deep in their plots and this one does not disappoint.  Inception has a very interesting plot that immerses you from the very start and then wraps the whole thing up in the end.  Great flick...
1609611543|5.0|Really enjoyed all the informative information in this book. I also purchased the cookbook and would recommend both to anyone who really would like to avoid wheat for any reason. Easy to follow and most of the ideas are &#34;doable&#34; with a busy lifestyle. Very happy to have found this book!
B008IJTFYW|3.0|Can't decide if I like this. Many items are so repetitive. Combining items was somewhat better. Try it you might like it!
B001AX9DT0|5.0|Ray LaMontagne was a singer I found through a commercial.  I am so glad that I did.  After buying his album, I realize that his voice soothes me more than I know.  He is calming and I wish that more people knew of him.  Truly a brilliant artist.
B005LAII8K|3.0|When you watch this film, Bruce Willis will urge his younger self (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) to forget about \\"space-time continuum\\" stuff. This, of course, is a statement aimed at the audience, who are likely to ask questions about how time travel works according to the \\"Looper\\" universe.<br /><br />So out of respect for this review, I will try not to poke holes at the time travel rules. But there are way too many questions to ask, especially when it comes to the logic of certain characters.<br /><br />SPOILERS AHEAD! Do not read if you haven't seen!<br /><br />1. Abe, the mob boss from the future who was sent back from the future to run the present-day mob, goes out of his way to explain to Young Joe (read: the audience) that it is dangerous to have someone from the future running around in the past/present. If that's true, why is Abe there? Does his younger self in the year 2044 know about him being there?<br /><br />2. Why would the mob mandate that loopers in the present day kill their own future selves? It's extremely risky to assume that anyone would be okay with doing such a thing. It's already risky enough that they hire junkies, some of them with telekinetic powers, to do their dirty work. Are they trying to test the loopers' loyalty? Are they just being sadistic? It would seem more logical to send the future retired loopers to other looper assassins, and therefore keep them in the dark about their ultimate fate. This would make them much more obedient too.<br /><br />3. So we learn early on in the film that whatever happens to people in the present will carry the effects to people in the future, including body mutilation and death. And this happens no matter what timeline the future people are living in. So why did the mob in the present find it necessary to cut off Young Seth's body parts in order to lure Old Seth just so they can fatally shoot Old Seth before eventually killing Young Seth? Why didn't they just shoot Young Seth in the head? They would have literally killed two birds (or, men) with one stone (or, bullet) without so much blood and carnage. And as we clearly see at the end of the film, if you kill someone in the present, including yourself, their future selves will cleanly disappear, even if their future selves are residing in the present. My only guess is that the mob wanted to be extremely sadistic and dole out the worst punishment possible to anyone who lets someone from the future run loose, especially if it's themselves. And speaking of killing your future self...<br /><br />4. How does Sara know about loopers? Young Joe seems surprised that she knows, and he asks her about it. But she never answers.<br /><br />5. What exactly does Young Joe accomplish by killing himself at the end? Old Joe tells Young Joe in the diner that the Rainmaker \\"saw his mom get shot.\\" Now of course, that was somewhere during the original timeline where Old Joe does not survive his execution. But what that means is that the rainmaker apparently rose to power even without any interaction from Old or Young Joe. Why didn't he at least try to kill Old Joe? Old Joe wouldn't be able to retaliate without seriously hurting himself. And even if Old Joe succeeded in killing Sara so that he could get to Cid, it would have given Young Joe all the time he needed to kill Old Joe and try to find Cid. He could then use his excessive amount of silver and gold to raise Cid in a positive environment. After all, Cid likes Young Joe, and he's a smart kid, so Cid would be a low-maintenance child to care for. And if he succeeded in protecting Sara, then his job would be even easier with the two-parent household, AND his enormous sum of money. Not to mention the fact that Old Joe killed the rest of the mob in the present day, so they're safe from their enemies.<br /><br />If Young Joe was serious about killing Old Joe, he should have done it when Old Joe pulled up in front of him and told him to go \\"live your life,\\" instead of shooting randomly at the truck that Old Joe was driving when he clearly could have hit him.
B0002S947K|5.0|I have become such a huge fan of Ray LaMontagne.  His voice is so rare and unique that I cannot explain it unless I let people hear it.  I have turned others on to him and made them fans.  He is so special and I am so in love when I listen to him sing.
B00A5052YE|5.0|I am a fan of Alicia Keys and I love her music.  She empowers women of all ages and situations/concerns/issues to be all that they can be and to know that they can do it.  We must take steps to step out there and just do it.  The music is excellent for young ladies who are coming into their own not to be fearful but embrace their future.  Enjoy the music.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|He is a true talent.  I was never into POP music but Bruno Mars is quickly changing my mind.  He is a real talent and this album made me buy his new one as well.  He is a great talent and I would say buy this!!!
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I experienced almost every emotion reading this. Amazing!! You feel like you're Layken, experiencing everything. So so so good! A definite must read!
B000GPIPVU|5.0|His voice is one of the most beautiful I have ever heard.  Throaty and soothing but so unique.  You can listen to this album from start to finish.  He is a rare talent in this day of auto tune...he needs nothing to make him sound so beautiful.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The character interplay is very intriguing, as is the budding growth of both worker and women's rights. Totally believable...but some of the characters in power probably represent the writer's wish of what they had been like rather than how brutal and pompous they actually were.
B00454U1NS|3.0|I like it.  Sober is a great song and I find that I play it a lot.  I think she is very talented and real.  If you are interested in a strong female singer, Pink is a great buy.  I am generally into 70's music and bands, but I find something interesting about her.  She can sing in real life too, so that is the allure.
B008MEM24S|5.0|The game alone is lots of fun with good challenges. Add in Perry and friends just makes it better, and their encouragement when you succeed is nice, and Doofensmurtz teasing when you fail is also entertaining.  The gameplay is smooth, the sounds fun, and graphics are great on the Kindle hd.
B0074MZSWW|3.0|Yes, I would recommend this album however it has taken me a bit of time to really get into it.  I wanted it to be more like You Aint Alone, but I found it to be a bit muddy and out of sorts at times.  I like the female leads voice but it is the music that REALLY keeps me interested.  I wish it was more like the commercial I fell in love with, but I think their next will be better.  I am on board.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|My daughters were playing this game, so I joined.  It's fun enough, but would be improved by a timer and competitive point system.  Would also like to be able to archive or save favorite drawings.  I like games that are a bit quicker paced, but this one is good for all ages and abilities.
0345803485|2.0|We were curious about what 50 Shades of Grey was all about, I bought the book for my mom, as she was a few pages into the book I asked soooo what's the 50 Shades of Grey about so far, she said it was boring at first BUT she stopped reading it a quarter of the way through because of all the demanding sex acts !!!!!  She didn't like it ..... Maybe I should read a few pages just to make sure ......LOL
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|I like this movie much more now that I have seen it on blu ray. It really brings the story to life even though the blood now looks really fake.
B0094K1K42|1.0|Scenes of a pedicure and then a manicure?  That's when I turned the film off.  Surprised Charlize Theron would accept a project like this. Thank god I didn't spend $10 at the cinema to see it.  I love how they manage to make the film look so funny in the trailer.  Those scenes, unfortunately, were the only funny scenes in the movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to play and of course addicting. would recommend product to anyone who likes a card game. it's a must have product.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Fast read. I found this book very intriguing. I do believe in heaven and this book helped confirm what I all ready knew in my heart.
1451695195|5.0|The is a great book.  I enjoyed every word.It is well written and really makes you think about life after death.,
B00867GHS8|5.0|This was a gift for my granddaughter...the whole family watched Finding Nemo and loved it, especially in 3D and Blu Ray.
B0059XTUVI|3.0|I was really looking forward to seeing the life story of Margaret Thatcher, but the writer/director didn't depict her the way I expected. Although Streep did a predictably brilliant job in her role, the issues are with the way she was portrayed. Her true character, strength and intelligence weren't allowed to shine here, and I think this director intended to make her seem like a \\"weak shrew\\" instead of the strong leader she truly was. Perhaps a book about the great Margaret Thatcher would have been a better bet here.
B001DMJ9R4|5.0|A big fan keep up good work.i'll get all my music from u guys.thanks a lot. I would tell all my buds to use u.
B000K7VHPU|5.0|Ed Norton plays a gifted illusionist in this well done film. He wows the audiences he entertains, and they believe he has \\"magical\\" powers beyond mortal man, and they try to figure out how he does it! There is an underlying love story attached, and the outcome will amaze you right to the very end! This one gets my \\"two thumbs up\\"! Ed Norton is always a good watch if you aren't familiar with him, he's truly a brilliant and gifted actor. You'll seek out more of his work if you haven't seen him in other films, as I did. He never lets me down!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|This device was purchased for a 15-year-old.  I haven't heard that he has conquered it yet; hope he hasn't thrown it against a wall!  &#34;Perplexus&#34; is certainly an appropriate name for this gadget.
B00AHXIC50|4.0|Unorthodox Jukebox [Explicit] - Enjoyable and fun to listen too - to few songs.  I like the beat and tempo of Bruno Mars
030758836X|4.0|This book was absolutely crazy, but in a very good way. I love the twists and turns in this story and I was at a loss of words with the female character (Amy Dunne). This just tells you that women are a lot more vindictive than men (not sure if this would be considered a spoiler alert). I couldn't put this book down. The only minor complaint I have is the end of the book. I wish the author had expanded on it just a little more, but overall it was a very good read.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|You can't go wrong with John Corey.....as always with DeMille the subject matter is intense but his character Corey makes it so readable I couldn't put it down.
B009K0P10K|4.0|I guess I'm rating two things here - Revenge and Amazon Streaming.  First off, Revenge -- Love the series!!  Second, Amazon Streaming - There was a bit of a buffering issue and the useability isnt 100% - though for the ease and no commercials - I love it!!
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Item was received as advertised in good condition. It is being used daily in its intended use and has performed adequately.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It is very convient to look at the actual amount of battery life I have left on my Kindle at any time you are working with the Kindle.
B008I34ZFW|1.0|Still more entertaining than 'Nacho Libre', this is one of the worst films I've ever seen.  The only good thing about it is the special effects which are pretty decent considering.  Dumb, dumb, dumb.
B00007E8SW|5.0|John Coltrane - A Love Supreme , SACD<br /><br />  A masterpiece of musical expressionism and one of my most beloved jazz albums !  This album has been reviewed a million times and considered by jazz affectionados as one of the pinnacle jazz album so not uch really to add.<br /><br />  Essentialy this is Coltrane doing what he does best......conveying feeling thru his music.  A Love Supreme really is an emotional rollercoaster ride moving from sad to happy to high to low emotions.  Trane draws on his jazz mates of Elvin Jones, McCory Tyner and Jimmy Garrison  who helped create IMHO one of the most thought-provoking, emotive and technically pleasing jazz albums of all time.<br />  This was intended very much to be a spirtual prayer album with Coltrane playing some of his most emotive reed work ever!<br />  I think this album really breathes.......it is not Coltrane on heroin.....but rather Coltrane creating a very unique sound scape where he can covey his music spiritually.<br />  If you are a jazz lover then you already know this album and have discovered it's inner beauty....for those new to jazz this is a great place to start.<br /><br />  The Impulse SACD was restorred and mastered for SACD by Rudy Van Gelder in 2002 and was one of the first SACD's I had to own after buying my SACD player!  This SACD has a few of the original source limitations which You can hear but was left intact purposefully by Van Gelder to ensure the integrity of the master is passed on.  The mix is excellent too with great instrument clarity and the right amount of seperation.  I think the drums are mixed very clear and seem very bright and accentuated a bit more than other recordings I have which helps I think make this SACD feel so fresh.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|Interesting..... sometimes boring ...but a good story. Buying another book from the author,I'll let you know later how goose they
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|A good free text app for my Kindle Fire. I've used it a bit and find it useful and not buggy. I also like that it is capable of rich text and bullets, numbers.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love solitaire and love that I can play this game offline....must have for those who love solitaire games..get it now.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|The script was a little formulaic..  Jeremy Renner&#34;s performance is spot on, however.  It's a guilty pleasure movie for sure but doesn't hold up to the others story wise.
B004H4XL7E|4.0|Oren Klaff's writing style really draws you into the book, he outlines all the key concepts of a great pitch and follows them up with real life examples. I quite enjoyed the read and came away with some new ideas on &#34;The Pitch&#34;. I have not had a chance to put many into practice yet, but the few I have, have worked with great results.<br /><br />Pitch anything is a must read for anyone running their own business that deals primarily with other businesses. It would also be a great read for anyone in corporate sales.
B000TYV3C6|5.0|i got em right on time and great package. i cnt complain really,everything was as described ,and i always wanted em.
0547884591|3.0|While I've been a long time fan of Tim Ferriss and was an early &#34;convert&#34; to the Four Hour Work Week lifestyle.. I can't help but see this book as a re-hash of his previous two. Sure there is a lot of new content, but its the same concepts in a different context.<br /><br />I did learn some new things from this book, but I'm hoping Tim comes up with something completely new with his next book.
B008B1VYP0|5.0|Bought this for kindle . Sounds great playback Have also bought for cell phone. If u have the non explilit version  some songs ok for kids.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|perfect thermal compound for TEC peliter element , just note that it is so small that it may not be sufficient to your project
B00AE2LJVS|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. Did not know that it was based on a true story and will now read the book. Had some good action scenes. Kind of violent at times, but expected that when I ordered it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was so well done. I love how Katniss tried to escape life but had a boy and a girl with the one she couldn't live without, Pests.
B0077ZNCE2|1.0|It was my wife's turn to pick a movie. I would rather get my teeth cleaned than sit through this. On the good side, it was only 99 cents. Sparkling vampires are lame.
B009AY04A8|5.0|I love HO games and most of the ones by Nevosoft. Keep them coming, with good storyline and graphics.  Thanks
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|This movie is great from start to finish. I actually bought the Blu ray version right after watching it. Only negative is some of the fight scenes are to dark to see of the action. But that is no reason not to watch this movie. If you liked the The Dark Knight, you will like this one even more.
B003H6KRIE|5.0|I started watching the bourne identity thinking something like this: \\"it is going to be another hollywood crap\\", several stupid explosions, a beautiful woman (who haven't fight or use any gun ever) destroying anything, matt damon (jason bourne) making jokes at and after the moment he fall from an airplane without parachoute, and so on you know about it!! So i let you know that i was completely wrong!!! and i'm glad of it.<br />These movies are the best of the best of their kind!!! I'm simply speechless!!! Awesome!!!! Five Stars for sure!!!!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I love Gillian Flynn's books, but this is my favorite!  Gritty and raw, it's not the typical book I would read, but her style is wonderful.  I couldn't put this book down.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is SO eventful and amazing. The romantic side escalate of action. Cant wait for the next one!!! So amazing.
B00A757EFW|1.0|LOOKS like the real PacMan of old, but certainly doesn't operate as such!<br />The controls are horrible for this game!!<br />Couldn't get ANYWHERE due to the lack of control!<br />Don't bother!
B0007LCNKC|5.0|Great Service! This item shipped very quickly and included everything it said it would! I am very pleased with my purchase.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put it down. I loved it. I can not wait for the next one. Great, greAt book. Love it.
B007ZM9I1I|4.0|this was a really good game the tiles ver ver detailed like when the money was of the game aswell ;) recomend this game
B00AQMSJI2|2.0|The game started out okay but you soon learn the buugs in the game. I started a quest find the runes on a island. After spending money on expanding and almost getting to the runes the game shuts down and exits out. Every time you try the quest the same thing happens and there are other bugs. Ya I know it's a free game but if this is how they treat a free game how are they with one you pay for?
B001VFTYW8|4.0|Was a pretty interesting book, the Kay Scarpetta series is a very addicting series to read and always has a twist
B001FB55HQ|3.0|not much bonus features, this dvd version really just contains the film. As for the film, if you're fan of Arnold, don't bother with it. Terminator was terminated when he was longer the lead character. What makes the different is that first 3 films are action thriller and part comedy, but the fourth film is much like a survivor horror, in which is not bad. But it sort of defiles the title, it's not \\"terminator\\" anymore, it should be called \\"war of machines\\", completely different direction. I'm struggling between giving the film 3 or 4 stars. In the end, it's still a disappointment without much of terminator action. As for a sci-fi war film, I think this is pretty cool movie. Christian Bale starts as John Connor in the early stage of war tried to lead the resistance to the ultimate victory, he did a fair job in my opinion since any leader would be skeptical if you face so many hump of metal in battle. The story is sort of typical in a survival film, whether face aliens, zombies or machines, all the films tried to answer the question \\"what make us human\\", what better way to answer the question than having a character is neither human nor machine and struggle to find his place. Overall, this is not a terminator film but it could pass on as a good survivor war film.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|Facebook-Not a real big fan. It is handy, though, to be able to look at it and not get on the computer.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I loved the game on the I pod touch but I love it more on here this is an awesome game.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Flow Free- Really enjoyed playing this game. Never played anything like it before, so it was a treat. I think most people would find this enjoyable.
B006RXQC2Y|5.0|Pretty Woman is a classic romcom with a fairy tale ending. A modern update of the Cinderella story of two unlikely people meeting by chance and falling in love. I was able to watch on my Roku via the Amazon Instant Video service in HD format with no buffering  or streaming issues.
B00A757EFW|3.0|Pac-Man Lite was just OK for me. I found it hard to play on a small screen. I am sure that it would be better on  a larger screen.It sure did bring  back memories of the old days, though. I think most people would enjoy it.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|It is always a pleasure downloading my books through Amazon. The Racketeer is another example of a John Grisham great book.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!!! Although I had trouble with the tilting so your character could switch sides, but if you shut down your Kendle it works just fine!! It is so awesome.
B004QOB8SY|5.0|This program is so beautiful to watch! I recommend it to all my friends. I can't wait for the next season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was the perfect story of hardships, a little romance, and friendship. Was absolutely amazing and very descriptive. One of the best books I've ever read.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|It's pretty clever. The story-line was predictable. But it was one of those fun girly movies. I liked the mash-ups too.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|this does not give you near enough information,I'm very new to kindle or I pad so I really need alot more answers

B00AIQP9DE|5.0|While I'm not a fan of the &quot;free&quot; games that really aren't, I'm enjoying this game.  Haven't yet decided to pay......
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It worked and it was free. I played it through till the end and had no problems with it. Even if I did, how could I complain, it was free
B005ISQ7JM|5.0|found it, purchased it at a good price, delivered timely, works as advertised. couldn't want more. I'd buy here again.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Fun twist on an old favorite. I'm not a huge fan of either &#34;birds&#34;  or &#34;star wars&#34; but I got my dollars worth of fun out of it
B002RKSCA6|5.0|found it, purchased it at a good price, delivered timely, works as advertised. couldn't want more. I'd buy here again.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|This novel was so inspiring to me. I am 21 years old, yet so many aspects hit  home. The emotions were relatable, and powerful. I recommend it for anyone having a hard time in life. For anyone who thinks they don't stand a chance with someone.  For anyone who just wants to know they're not alone.<br /><br />Beautifully written and innovative. A clever concept with the dual narratives. Extremely powerful and hopeful.
B00913DPW2|4.0|did all the other puzzles but that tile puzzle underground is so bad.  after days I did the first puzzle THEN another one is under that one.  no matter how many times,  or jumps,  or hours, 2 pieces are always backwards.  makes you furious with this game & the designers.<br />After days of tile puzzle work, I was a little steamed, only to find on 'Game Options' a 'Skip Puzzle' setting, so I got past that point. Very tough game, but now I would up my scoring to 4 stars. Would love to know on that puzzle, did the bear go on L, Lion on Right with plant in center, or animals on R & plant on L as I thought either way looked correct???

0765325950|1.0|I don't normally do this but until this is released for my Kindle I have to give it a one star. I have faithfully purchased and read every single book in this series, however, unless this last one is released on Kindle I won't read the ending. Did the wife or the publisher think of people who are handicapped and can't actually hold these heavy books to read them?  I guess not.  I had a stroke in 2011 and since then I can't physically hold larger books.  I actually purchased my Kindle kicking and screaming.  I have an extensive library and there's always been something about holding a book and turning the pages, however, we use the hand we're dealt so I've had to adapt.  Unfortunately I read so much that the cost of purchasing both a hardcover and Kindle edition is prohibitive.  And I absolutely can't stand audio books.  Have tried them and I detest them.  The act of reading puts me into the story, however, someone reading it to me does nothing.  So ZERO STARS for this book and sod off to Jordan's wife and the publisher.  I WANT MY KINDLE EDITION.  When I can purchase it and read it then I'll change my review.<br /><br />UPDATED REVIEW: I purchased the entire series on my Kindle and decided to read over so I'm just now updating my previous review.  I also purchased the hardcover to complete my collection even though I was unable to read it because of the size.<br /><br />I was disappointed with this last book.  It became tedious to read because it seemed like it was just one long battle.  Some of the story lines didn't mesh up for me and he left a lot of plot lines dangling....for instance the scene where Tuon told Matt she was pregnant so she'd have to kill him and then that was that.....no resolution of their relationship or where the Seanchan  was in the WoT universe....also who did Rand end up with?  What about the Aiel prophecy of doom Aviendha saw?  Too many plots left dangling and Rand just rides off into the sunset?  Nope.... didn't work for me so I'm leavingthe star rating the same because of the above.  This last book seems like an afterthought as in \\"I gotta get this series finished\\".
B004VMUS9G|5.0|works great became a lifesaver after I broke my phone and didn't have an alarm wish it went a little louder though
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is very entertaining. It is my favorite game on my kindle. The graphics are beautiful and the game itself gets progressively more difficult as you go from level to level.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Read the omnibus edition on a flight from the US to Singapore. It kept me entertained through some very long hours with a great story. Not sure a tin tube in the air is the best place to read it though, given the storyline...<br /><br />Would definitely recommend it.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|I have read all of the Pendergast series and really enjoyed them. Not only does this book continue in that vein, it adds a new twist that provides the authors with many additional avenues to explore. I enjoyed it and would recomend it to anyone who enjoys mysteries.

0765325950|1.0|Came on here excited to drop my $20 and immediately read the final book in an amazing epic fantasy series on my Kindle. Was sorely disappointed. Now I guess there's no choice other than to wait days till I can visit a brick and mortar store, weeks for the book to be posted, or months for the ebook to be released ... or just pirate the thing and get my instant gratification.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|It's okay-ish.  Some parts were quite nice.  Well made.  But as a whole, for instance, I felt like that one subplot, which will go unspecified to avoid spoilers, belonged in another movie.

1455519650|5.0|This is actually the second Harry Bosch novel but not the first one I've read. However, it was a great read. Harry hasn't has his big falling out yet with either his boss, Pounds or his big boss, Irvin Irving. Of course, that doesn't mean he listens to either one of them.<br /><br />In this case, he goes after a cop killer. With the usual twists and turns, the case takes him from the seedy areas of Hollywood to the Mexican border. All I can say is that I enjoyed the read. I only had a vague sense of what was really going on, though I had an idea of the big surprise at the end. It doesn't matter though, because it was still a lot of fun just getting there.<br /><br />Told with the usual solid third-person style, this was another keeper. I'm now missing only two of the series that are written in third-person. The other two, which are in first-person, I'll never get because I hate first-person. Too bad as I'd like to have read the entire series. The crossover books are the same way, except they are half first-person and half third. That's even worse.<br /><br />As for this one, I loved it and can't wait to dive into the next one. Well done and highly recommended.

B005RJ6AIK|5.0|I am a Kamaaina (Hawaiian for 'local boy') and moved to England over 30 years ago. I grew up with \\"proper\\" Hawaiian music but for decades I've been disgusted by the commercial rubbish, created for tourists, which prevailed in movies (Elvis' stuff being a prime example).<br />Over Christmas I saw this and loved it mostly because the 'local' story is very authentic re land owned by the few. But, it was a bonus that the soundtrack is as authentic as the film. I put this down to Ms Hemmings, author and 'kamaaina', who most likely advocated the use of authentic music for her great work.<br />Hawaiian music is unique, beautiful, fun, and very soothing. It reflects the Hawaiian culture in its feel and is a big part of local life - it's on the radio, at all celebrations, in clubs and bars, at parties, on the beach. This soundtrack is a terrific collection of authentic stuff with my favourite artists featured - particularly Gabby Pahinui and Keola Beamer whom I used to see in local bars in rural Oahu singing Hawaiian songs to room fulls of local folk. Quite marvellous. Get it and let the sounds wash over you - and don't worry about the words.....few of us understand them either.

0385344333|2.0|I want to like the Reacher books more than I do. The best thing about them is Reacher's ability to see the implications of seemingly innocuous comments and circumstances. He doesn't solve \\"cases\\" through physical evidence or conventional police work (they aren't cases in the conventional sense, only extraordinary situations that he constantly--and unrealistically--finds himself in). He simply observes things and sees connections and implications that others miss. It's a fun sort of game to play as a reader, seeing if you can catch those meanings before Reacher does, and Reacher himself is an intriguing character because of his nomadic lifestyle. But he's a thoroughly unlikable character, an arrogant thug completely out of touch with any kind of human feeling or moral consequence.<br /><br />That's part of the reason I don't like these books as much as I want to. It's not just that Reacher has no feelings and no awareness of others' feelings--Sherlock Holmes is arrogant and unaware of others' feelings (one of the most delightful moments in the new British modernization of the Holmes stories is the moment when Watson suggests under his breath that Holmes has Asperger's syndrome), but the Holmes books have Watson, who is constantly concerned with others' feelings. That tells us that Arthur Conan Doyle is aware of and concerned about human things. In the Reacher books, there is no Watson. In fact, no other character ever seems to call Reacher on his brutish indifference. You get the sense that Lee Child himself must be like Reacher in that regard. In this book, there's a point where a 10-year-old girl's mother is kidnapped and presumed killed in the middle of the night. The mother is a cocktail waitress on her way out of work after midnight when she is taken. None of the law enforcement people involved express the slightest surprise or reaction of any kind that a mother would routinely leave a 10-year-old child home alone for most of the night. Nor does anyone suggest that a relation or neighbor should be contacted or any state agency get involved with the child. It's as though those things didn't even occur to the author.<br /><br />Then there are the frequent errors of basic facts and an appalling lack of research. For example, at the beginning of this book, Reacher is picked up hitch-hiking 80 miles west of Omaha, and the car is described as driving down a six lane interstate. Anyone who has driven through Nebraska even once will know that Interstate 80 is four lanes across the entire state, spreading to six and eight lanes only in the last eight or ten miles as you enter Omaha. At another point, Child describes a car driving through the checkerboard pattern of fields where the road intersections are eight miles apart. Everyone in Nebraska knows that those checkerboards are exactly one mile square. And Child describes the landscape as notable flat, but eastern Nebraska is rolling topography; the land only becomes flat in the western half of the state, hundreds of miles from the locations where the book takes place. All of those might be put down to an author writing about a place he had never been--and really, how hard would it be for a successful author to go to Nebraska for a little research before he begins writing, or even do ten minutes worth of Googling?--but then he makes several references to clouds and storms rolling in from the east and chasing the characters from Iowa into Nebraska. Anyone who has ever watched a national weather forecast, looked at a NOAA map, or paid the slightest attention to weather patterns knows that in the United States weather fronts ALWAYS move from west to east. There may be occasional fronts moving northeast or southeast, but never, ever east to west, and particularly in the midwest. This sort of lazy research and ignorance would be frustrating in any book, but to find it in a series based entirely on observation and obsession with facts and numbers is really alarming.<br /><br />And when an action sequence crops up, Child's inner geek always gets in the way. When the bad guy points a gun at Reacher and fires, that doesn't just happen in a second. We have to wade through paragraphs of discussions of gun mechanics, ammunition characteristics, physics, etc., etc. By the time the bullet actually reaches its impact point, Reacher could have gone out to lunch and come back. This sort of thing happens in every potential action scene, and it bogs down the book badly.<br /><br />But my biggest complaint is that Child makes the events happen to suit his plot line, rather than have events and reactions happen naturally and the characters and plot follow them (or appear to--the art of fiction writing). Absurd coincidences are routine plot devices, and characters regularly ignore something the in real life they would never miss, but that would inconveniently derail the prescribed plot. For example, at one point in this book, Reacher has discovered that the two men he is riding with in the car are armed killers and that they've kidnapped the woman passenger. He spends a lot of time considering how he might overcome them in the car, but determines, rightly, that it's impossible because of the logistics and room in the vehicle. Shortly after that, they stop for gas and Reacher goes into the store to get coffee and secretly call the FBI from the phone back in the enclosed hallway by the bathrooms. He sees one of the bad guys coming and hangs up the phone, and the two of them pass each other in the narrow hallway.Here's Reacher, who, we are constantly reminded, is \\"huge,\\" \\"gigantic,\\" \\"enormous,\\" able to knock out a tank with his fist, more deadly than any 20 people put together. He's alone in an enclosed space with one of the killers, with the other one oblivious outside, and Reacher does. . . nothing at all. He walks by calmly and goes back out to the car so he can be in an untenable position again. It's absurd. He could have disarmed and disabled the killer in a heartbeat, but he does nothing. He doesn't even consider doing anything. Why? Because if he did, the story would be over. Child needs for it to go another 200 pages, so he just has the characters do whatever is necessary to achieve that end. This is typical of how all his books unfold, and it's very annoying.<br /><br />But for all my complaints the puzzle aspect of the plot and Reacher's deductive abilities make it worth reading. I just wish Child would work a little harder for us. These books could be so much better than they are.n action sequence crops up, Child's inner geek always gets in the way.

B002N5N4M6|3.0|Didn't play at one point.  Was a bit disappointed with that but overall a nice gift for Xmas this year.
B003KRJNBW|4.0|I was circumspect about this movie when I first read the reviews but I was desperate for science fiction so I decided to go for it. Besides, I love both Denzel Washington and Malcolm McDowell so it seemed like it might be worth the risk.<br /><br />At first I was disappointed. I burned out on the Mad Max genre in the eighties and that's what this looked like. Ten minutes in I almost turned it off because the stark colors in the landscapes were actually making me sick to my stomach. However, the fight scenes were well done so I stuck with it.<br /><br />After a while, I was hooked. The strength of Washington's character, the spiritual overtones, and the mystery behind his journey really kept me intrigued. The draw was similar for me with the Battlestar Galactica reboot: people writhing around in squalor and filth, reduced to their most base nature, devoid of hope, and yet still a few manage to rise above it and remember what's important. It's what we all hope we'll do when and if we wake up one day and find the grocery store shelves empty and the bodies of our friends and neighbors scattered about: be a human being and not an animal.<br /><br />There are some minor flaws. Where did they get all that gas? Why are there so many well fed people? But let's not pick nits. It's a good film and it will leave you with a good feeling.

B006CQLGXG|5.0|If anyone saw a movie adaptation of the Christmas Carol, or even if you haven't, this book is a must-read. Charles Dickens uses lots of humor in the book, and it has a wonderful story and set of characters. I recommend this book for anyone looking for a good long read.

B001BWDG0W|5.0|Well-cast, engaging, great versions of the songs considering some of the actors are not singers. Nicely paced and beautiful cinematography.  Not a bad script at all.  Very much for the baby-boomers reliving their glory days.

B002ZG98UA|1.0|Not sure where this is going, but this was a real let-down after the previous movies, which are surprisingly good considering their source material is pretty light.  This installment lacks the grit and depth that was a facet of the others.

This is for those who enjoy a decent action film and generally don't care for gratuitous blood and generous views of what lies under the bad guy's skin.  That's the kind of action fan I am, Bond, Bourne, Sniper, Jet Li.  I didn't really care for the Expendables; I give that a 'meh'.<br /><br />Dredd is actually something quite decent.  Yes there is gore, amazing gore in slow motion.  Sure, the plot is so simple you could sum the entire thing up as \\"Drug bust... Perps resisted\\".  Yeah the lead protagonist has a voice that makes Christian Bale's Batman voice seem melodic.  However, it was a very decent movie.<br /><br />I enjoyed this movie in several ways.  There are several nice artfully filmed segments.  The action is not over the top Rambo style, but more of a western gunslinger style of shoot out.  The characters do in fact grow on you in spite of the fact that you know almost nothing at all about them.  I don't read the comics so everything I know about Dredd comes from the Sly Judge Dredd movie.  This is a much darker and significantly better movie than the 1995 Dredd film.  Somehow the directing and acting drew me into the characters without making any obvious attempts to get me to like them.  Character development was conspicuously absent, and perhaps that's where the magic is. I was fully satisfied these protagonists.<br /><br />The climactic finish was mesmerizing.  I wanted to look away, but was spellbound.<br /><br />If you enjoy a good action flick now and then give this one a shot.  It is gory, but even if you are not a gore fan, like me, you may still like it; it's graphic gore artfully done.
B001F7MSFW|5.0|Lovely movie, deep and kind of sad, but fun on the other hand with some excellent dialog.  Love the scene where HB and Abe sing Barry Manilow.  Great movie.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|In my opinion Movies 1, 2 and 3 are some of the best movies ever with a great character, Dr. Henry (Indiana) Jones. He gets into one adventure after another. Just about makes a person want to be an Archaeologist..... These movies are highly entertaining and fun. Well worth the price of admission. The fourth movie is not as bad as a lot of people say..... It's not as good as the first three but it's not bad.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I was so engulfed in this book. It took me only two days to read it.  Can't wait to see how the third book finishes this wonderful series!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Probably still my favorite superhero movie, and this version of it is terrific. I thought it looked great on Blu ray.

0545265355|5.0|Originally bought this for my daughter who was in 8th grade at the time. Needless to say, I ended up reading the entire set in less than a week!! Great books for the tweens, teens & young adults, and their -parents!!

B00A23MYCC|5.0|Ted is Effin hilarious! It is definitely bound to be in the archives that include The Hangover, Old School, 40 Year Old Virgin, etc.<br /><br />If you haven't seen it, then you have at least heard of it.....If you haven't heard of it, then you have been living under a rock, and should BUY it!! Don't waste $3 renting it, because you are going to end up spending another $15 buying it after you watch it the 1st time anyway!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Love the album. Even better than Brothers! It is definitely a must have. :)<br /><br />Yes, I would recommend this to others.

B003JTHXOK|5.0|AWESOME!!!!! Favorite book ever so far!! The ending kinda made me mad but hopefully there will be another  one to spin it offff
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved to read this book because I just didn't know what was going go happen next. I hated the main character, but she had to be like that because the book wouldn't have been any good without her.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Starts off kind of slow , but picks up and surprises you in the middle. Then it nothing but action and more surprises throughout the book. I could not put my kindle down.
B004LE7PCM|5.0|A obra completa é um achado! Leitura obrigatória para os apaixonados por ficção. Rápido e fácil de se ler deixa o leitor mergulhar nesse mundo maravilhoso de nosso querido Sir.

B0070Y46UY|5.0|Started out a little slow but as I kept reading I understood how it was leading up to the story.  Almost didn't want to keep reading...glad I did.  Very good story of survival.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Can't beat free you know?  Lots of levels and good graphics.  And it allows a reset when the tiles are out of matches.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is awesome and fun because u do not need real money to enjoy this awesome game I love it.
B005QUQ99K|4.0|I purchased this toy for my nephew. I had not seen this particular Ninjago in the stores. He loved it, so that makes me happy.

0316227706|5.0|I first saw Seth Casteel's underwater pics on facebook.  So when the book came out I knew I had to have it.  I also gave one as a gift.  Anyone who loves dogs or animals in general needs this book.  The pics are incredible.  Seeing what the dogs also look like on land is an added bonus.
B003WUYOQ6|4.0|Premises well supported and convincing.  Good examination of conventional wisdom on weight management. Concise plan for going forward.  Book would benefit from more detail on diet implementation.
B000MAH5O2|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  It is especially helpful in understanding President Obama's goals and reasons for the way he thinks about everything.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Wonderful story, love the way the chapters are laid out describing each of the characters with flashbacks.  Not quite finished with the book - so haven't solved the &#34;mystery&#34; yet - but its a must read!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I love this book and the series it is quality writing and really takes you along for the ride .
B000YMM3CC|5.0|This is my favorite love story. I could watch it everyday. The acting is fantastic. The chemistry between the actors is amazing. If you want to laugh, cry, and wrapped up in the beauty and complexites of love, this is the movie for you.
B00AA7O6QC|5.0|Loved this movie better than the first one. I recommend it. If you like action, this movie will not disappoint you..
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|it is just plain awful....from beginning to end. For starters it should at least be rated PG-13. Not appropriate for young kids. From dead gangsters with cinder blocks around their ankles and another asking him if he is going to skip school. What were they thinking? Having to pry a book from a dead man's arms! They even made one of the characters homosexual. I don't care about people's orientation, but this is an animated movie obviously geared towards kids. This is not something I want to be forced to explain to a child in elementary school. Again...totally inappropriate. Way to go Hollywood!
B005LAIISA|5.0|It was very predictable in the beginning and I did dislike ''the teenagers'' and their predictable storyline, but it got better pretty soon. I liked most of new characters too and I am looking forward to meet at least few of them again, in the 5th movie set. The music however in the titles was bad. Probably some would like that kind of music, but I'd choose something else instead. Generally it has a good storyline, but again, except for young mammoths and that kiddo behavior, which was nothing new and nothing original.
0061122416|4.0|I had barely heard of \\"The Alchemist\\" twenty years after it became a run-away-best seller. I'd certainly had not been moved to buy it prior to my book club choosing it as our January 2012 reading selection. I thank them--it has enriched my life.<br /><br />\\"The Alchemist\\" is a simple story, told almost as a parable.  A tale that makes the reader think about his own journey through life.  And to put it in perspective.<br /><br />Santiago is a shepherd boy from the hills of Spain who follows his dream, his Personal Legend, to Africa--Tangiers first, the dessert and finally the Egyptian pyramids--in search of his \\"treasure\\".  He comes in contact with wise men, scoundrels, and Fatima, a beautiful woman of the desert, on his way to find \\"The Alchemist\\" who he had been told would lead him to his significant material treasure. Along the way, he learns new skills, makes fortunes--and loses them.<br /><br />If it takes deep character development, intricately designed sentences and a Tolstoy-like-plot, to make a truly great book, \\"The Alchemist\\" will not be included in the 100 Best Books of All Time.<br /><br />But if what you are always looking forward to is expanding your personal spiritual life, this is the  book for you. It makes you \\"think\\".<br /><br />As I analyzed some of the seemingly \\"wrong turns\\" I've made in my life, I came to realize that I, like Santiago, had been blessed by some of what I'd considered misfortune.  In 197 pages, Author Paulo Coelho has packed in lot of \\"food for thought.\\"
0670024813|2.0|Perhaps the positive reviews this book has received reflect Diamond's reputation as a prize-winning author and widely known lecturer, for this book does not, in my opinion, justify them. He focuses on thirty-nine \\"traditional societies,\\" which he defines as bands and tribes of small-scale farmers or hunter-gatherers. They are primarily in New Guinea (where he has traveled extensively, first as bird watcher studying migrations), Australia, Africa, and a few isolated locations in South America and Alaska. He is vague about chronology and jumps from one geographic area to another.<br /><br />My problem is that he offers little new information while including a very broad range of topics from cultural values to religion, raising children to treatment of the elderly, determining justice to conducting warfare, health practices and causes of disease, etc.  His suggestions about what modern societies can learn from traditional societies are overtly obvious, like utilizing grandparents as caretakers of young children. Duh!!! Because his previous books include a best-seller and Pulitzer-Prize winner, perhaps critics assume this is great scholarship.<br /><br />He cites dramatic examples from the writings of various anthropologists such as the Brazilian woman who dies alone on the beach in a breach birth because her tribe believed individuals should face hardships on their own, and the elderly Bolivian woman left to die alone when her tribe moved on. Were these representative of their tribe's culture as he claims or were they stories that shocked the anthropologists who wrote about them? How would an American tourist respond to a friendly group of locals at the next table at a sidewalk cafe who express the feeling they would be afraid to travel to America because it has armed guards in schools, malls, and movie theaters? They've seen it on TV and Diamond has read the accounts he describes in books, but are they representative of the culture? Readers are given no way to judge.<br /><br />Perhaps the most valuable part of this book are the few primary research studies cited by geographic region in the \\"Suggestions for Further Reading.\\" But be forewarned that generalized  statements the author makes throughout -- like \\"warfare is chronic\\" have no footnote citations to indicate whether these are opinions or facts established by reputable research studies. Readers who would like specific references are referred to the author's website.<br /><br />Judge for yourself.
B00A7ZWUJC|1.0|If I could choose 0 stars, I would.  This is without a doubt her worst album to date.  I have loved everything she has done since she began, but this album is such a disappointment.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Couldn't sleep until I read the whole book! It was a roller coaster of emotions. Love this story line! There is just something as about Travis and Abby that draws you in.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|After all of the initial hysteria wore off, I finally decided to give this book a try. I'm so glad I did, I loved it!
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|surprisingly enough this app really does work. it allows me to view and edit excel files on my kindle fire downloaded from email.
B007A2O3FO|5.0|My entire family LOVED this movie! The cast was wonderful, the plot interesting and intriguing , the scenery breath taking ...what more can one ask from a film. Children and adults alike will enjoy this movie that has a little bit of everything...a smile, a fright, a laugh, a lesson and walk away saying that was a well spent afternoon!
B004XDYJRU|5.0|this is a great app. used the free version for a couple years. theres a good selection of everything here. only wish they didn't list streams that dont work with the player.dont know why you would list something that doesnt play.
B00A757EFW|5.0|Playing Pac-Man brought back a lot of memories for me.  I am a little rusty at it, but will get better in time.  I love playing this game.  It is easy to get the hang of it.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|this app works well, and fast. theres plenty of info available including live radar which is interesting. as accurate as any other weather service i assume.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|It seemed a bit dragged out with all the kissing discriptions.  A bit less would have been more.  Overall it was a good read.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Wonderful read with an unexpected, lovely ending. As with other Nicholas Sparks books I've  read, the characters are wonderfully created and you feel as though you're part of the story.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love hidden object games but this one tops the cake...has objective to beat just adding to the charm. Highly recommend trying out this game, and best of all it is free
B003O86FMW|4.0|Katnis bitchyness is starting to annoy me, but the story still holds my attention. Being male and older, I'd like to see all the teenage girl romantic angst toned down a bit, too. However, if you liked the first book, you will probably like this one. I've already bought the third book because I want to see how it all ends. I am surprised that I can read an entire book in a day, though. Wonder if these electronic versions are abridged?
B005OHSD3A|5.0|IT'S WORKING! I seriously have never been so excited. So far I have been on the diet and lost 8 lbs
B001FB4VXU|4.0|Relative was elated to receive as gift. This item completed their ongoing collection of this subject. Thanks you very much.

B000QGEB12|5.0|This is a great movie! One of my favorites. Funny and fun with lots of great visual.  A must see for fans of the genre.
B009VB7P6G|5.0|so far all the tinker bell movies are a hit with her. she says she doesn't want to watch them but when they are on she watches them all the way through, it slows her down enough to let her get tired.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|Well, unlike the huge majority of people that complain about the movie being a prequel or a different story or not, I don't care.  It's actually a great cinematic experience to begin with and the story, though I must admit does have some gaps, it doesn't really affect the movie as it is.<br /><br />As far as the DVD itself, I've waited a few months hoping to see if there was going to be a special edition of the movie release because I love to see how the movie is made and the stories behind the scenes of the movie.  It did say that it has special features but it was just alternate and deleted scenes, which is nice but not that special.  THIS is the only reason I rated the purchase to a 3 star.  I really do wish the descriptions given to DVDs on amazon really start becoming specific to the purchase because giving general description of the movie is nice and all but the specs make a big difference to the full experience of the purchase.  Knowing what you're buying is crucial to make the buyer happy.<br /><br />So in conclusion, if you're looking for just a great cinematic experience this is a 5 star, for a great story this is a 4 star, if you are an über alien franchise fan it's a 3.5, and the DVD (just read the title).
B008K8H9C6|4.0|My 5 year old loves to create his own levels--it keeps him entertained, and is easier to use on the tablet than phone
0765325950|3.0|***Spoilers***<br /><br />Robert Jordan would be upset with the lines Sanderson gave Egwayne about 1/3 of the way through the story. Why is she still treating Mat and Rand as if they were children stealing pies off of the window sill? When Rand calls the kingdoms together I was irritated with everything she had to say at that meeting.<br /><br />Gawan dies in a hole in the ground waiting for Egwane to come save him. His death should have been more heroic. I did enjoy how Galad was portrayed though.<br /><br />Moraine's and Nyneve's characters might as well have been absent during the last battle, but they did come in handy at the VERY end.<br /><br />I kept wondering where Padan Fain was, until he finally comes into the story at the VERY end. There was no building up of this character. He was finally there and then he was quickly dealt with.<br /><br />Logains crown of glory will have to be a story you make up yourself. It is not evident why Min had this veiwing until the story is over. We never actually get to witness it.<br /><br />I thought for sure that either Mat or Logain were going be the one's who dealt Demondread's death blow, and was delightfully surprised when it was Lan.<br /><br />Mat is still the same old Mat, and I am extremely happy about that because he was my favorite character, running a close second to Thom Merelin who ended up playing a good part at the end. Sanderson uses word trickery to fool the reader into thinking Thom is a darkfriend when he knives a black sister who was shadowed to look like Cadsuane. I distintcly remember Thom saying that he would be horrified if the light won the battle over the dark right before he buries a knife in the black sisters back.<br /><br />All in all I guess Sanderson did what he could to tie up the many threads of the pattern Jordan created. I would not have been upset if he would have extended this to another book for a better fleshing out of the characters, but I guess he had to stop somewhere...<br /><br/>I loved this story and I'm sad to see it go. I do hope Sanderson is able to write the Stormlight archives with less that 3 years inbetween each book.
B005LAIHCM|5.0|this movie has many turns and is strange but i like it a lot your fast shipping of this movie has made me very happpy i just want to watch it again and again i enjoyed it .
B009HV2JT8|1.0|waste of money dont buy this. dull predictable and waste of my cash. seven more words are required to publish this review.
B004EPZ03O|4.0|The Muppets is a GREAT movie (I am an adult, but I grew up on The Muppets)! People of all ages will enjoy the clever humor. My only issue was that when it was shipped, the disc was loose in the DVD case so there was a small scratch from it rolling around in the case. Other than that I am very satisfied!
0679809015|3.0|i got this because its a board book and hoped it would resist toddler tearing. it did not. he pulled off all the tabs when i wasnt looking, one day. however we keep it and look at it a lot. he didnt do anything other than tear off the doors. the rest of its fine for reading and durable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is soo handy, now I don't have to search for it or go to Facebook. One click and your there!!
B002T9H2L0|1.0|Don't waste your time and certainly give up brain cells watching this horrible, idiotic, laughable, nonsensical movie. To have the memory of this vile film burned into my head, knowing full well that I wasted 2 hours of my life that cannot retrieve makes me question my judgment. Tarantino must have been smoking crack during the writing and production of this regrettable joke.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really enjoy this game very much and I have recommended it to quite a few other people to try.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is by far the best book I've read in ages. It drew me in and kept me on my toes throughout the entire thing. I'm usually pretty good about guessing what'll happen next, but this book always surprised and amazed me. The plot twists, the coincidences, fate, the LOVE... easily my new very favorite book. A must read!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Book 1: Nice short story.<br />Book 2: Boring as all hell.<br />Book 3: Now we are getting somewhere.<br />Book 4: Edge of my seat!<br />Book 5: AMAZING!<br />Now I know why this series is rated so highly.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love facebook so with the kindle it will be very entertaining while traveling.I like keeping up with friends & family.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Facebook is great to stay in touch with family and friends and they have so many apps and games available to users it can keep you busy 24 hrs a day!  But, I do not like that it allows users to post such foul language!  There are young users, teens, young adults, males, females, and the elderly using Facebook and they could at least keep it clean. I know that I can hide that post or delete that friend, but my grandchildren won't!  And...their privacy policies per user should allow for more ways to keep personal information hid!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun, game. More fun fun fun. I enjoy this game at the arcade almost as much as this app. Thank you.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Haven't used this much, but when trying to fill time waiting at the doctors it's fun!  I need to research the whole game because so far it's a bit easy!

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This book is John grishams  best. I loved it. Kept me guessing throughout. I highly recommend it to any of his readers.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Many twists and turns. This is, without a doubt the best book I have read in a long time.
B009PJXY3M|4.0|I love her sound and style.  I have heard her sing before but not like this.  This shows the inner soul she puts into her singing.
B003S5K8GK|5.0|Every time it touches my heart again and again. If you haven't seen this movie, I highly recommend it for you to put it on your list of to do for 2013.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Excellent love story for all ages and especially beautiful during the holidays.<br />Great stocking stuffer for a special person in your life.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wonder is a true wonder to read! It will make you cry and sometimes make you mad when people are mean to August.
B0029XFNA8|5.0|When I was little and watched this movie no one could tell me that Santa  was not true when he sang to that little girl in Dutch it made me so excited it took my breath away that's the magic that all children rich or poor should grow up with, even poor my parents always kept the magic alive for as long as they where with us.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. The book was so much more interesting than I thought it would be. It pulled me right  in!
B001IXXYBA|5.0|Absolutely adore this movie. Have since I was a kid. I boohoo every single time. In fact... just writing this (because amazon suggest it and I thought... what the hell) I think I'll watch it tonight and cry like a baby. And cackle like a loon because Whoopi is HILARIOUS in this movie. She doesn't get enough credit for how beautiful she was back in the day because she has such awesome humor. Love her. Love this. Love pat and demi. Such a classic.
B004QX07G4|2.0|I have enjoyed Ellen's wit...but this book couldn't keep my interest. It was just too &#34;cutsie&#34; and I could not continue. Stopped half way through. Like a gambler, I keep thinking the payoff was ahead, but finally accepted defeat.
B0031RAOVY|3.0|I dunno if I was just super emotional when I saw the trailer for this.... but I cried just watching the trailer lmao.I thought this was going to be an emotional roller coaster but it was sort of bland. It's a beautifully touching true story but I feel like it as just mssing something. They didn't develop the dog's personality like they could have I feel. He sort of just came off as a normal dog... a lug that ppl sort of resented... but not in the cute way like Chance from Homeward Bound... this was in the sort of dog lacking some personality way. I dunno. Just my thoughts. Very cute film. But I didn't bawl like I was hoping to.
B008602KQI|4.0|We enjoyed the movie but weren't as impressed with it as to what we expected after all the media hype that preceeded the movie. It was a good movie though.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I could watch this everyday and on a few occasions I have watched it a few days back to back. It's one of those rom com's that's just so different but you identify so much. Tugs on your realistic little heart strings. So cute. Hard to find good artistically written, modern, dry humor non traditional rom com's. This and Juno are the only ones I know that touch me in this same way. Classic.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I did not start watching this series until my friends started  talking about how great it was.  Now it's starting Season 3 and I was pleased that I could purchase the first two seasons to catch up.  Absolutely love it  - thanks for making this available.
B000YABYLA|5.0|One of my favorites. I could watch it over and over again. Love the soundtrack, too. I wish there were more movies out there like this. Turmoil but still an overall feel good movie with such unique and endless laughter from the satire and sarcasm.

B0044XV3QY|4.0|I'm one of those weirdos that didn't fall in love with Avatar. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, just not in my personal top 10. However, this movie in BluRay... WOW! The graphics are top notch in deed!

1451627297|1.0|I don't even know why I kept on reading this book after the first 2-300 pages.I wanted to love this book and I kept expecting that the next chapter would finally get to the real point of the story and move things along. It didn't.<br /><br />I was very disappointed by this book. I think it could have been wonderful and memorable. Instead, I just wanted to get it over with.<br /><br />The title is very catchy and Mr. King certainly grabbed my attention and millions of other readers with it. But things steadily go downhill from there. All the way to the ending that is just plain lame.<br /><br />A waste of paper, time, eyestrain....a story that probably could have been told in about 400 pages and for the better, not this bloated \\"doorstopper\\".<br /><br />read my full review at: myreallifereviews dot com

B007THA4FI|2.0|Is there any human defect that's not portrayed in this book ?? I kept hoping for some redeeming value but did not find it.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This was the best storyline I've read in a very long time! I NEED more of Katniss & Peeta! Whew!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This was a gift for my 15 year old son. He really enjoyed it! and I was surprised, because he's accustomed to the violent video games. We wanted him to try something more calm. And this was exactly what we were looking for.
B002VUFKG6|5.0|This book has opened my eyes to what marriage is, or can be, as she provides a good history of marriage. I think anyone questioning marriage for themselves, same sex couples, etc should read it. You might find yourself being a better mate, or more open-minded about who can marry.
B0071DJZZA|5.0|The Hunger Games was a great book. I read it in less than a day because I could not put it down for long.
B000W4RFHK|5.0|Words fly by and what is left?  Empty glory, impressions of that and there, but this, glorious empty this is here.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Movie arrived very quickly and was in great shape! It was a perfect Christmas gift and was a big hit.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|We kept hearing our friends rave about Downton Abbey, but we had missed the beginning, and we were busy with other things, and we just weren't sure we'd like it. But when I saw this DVD, we thought we'd try it. We sat down one evening to watch an episode. We watched three. Within four days, we had watched all the episodes of both seasons and were sleep-deprived. We are definitely fans now.
B005LAIHQS|5.0|Product real deal. Not a copy. I still don't like the supposed &#34;Digital&#34; copy. It's not truly downloadable. It's a copy off-line. Not for your computer.
B005LAIIQC|2.0|If you enjoyed the previous Bourne movies you will probably wish you had waited for this to come on TV, you would at least have a shot at one entertaining commercial as you will not find one on this movie.<br /><br />I am not sure a third would have worked even with Matt but it would have had a chance, this is a terrible knock off.
0345803493|5.0|The entire series is amazing. All three books just suck you in! They are definitely worth the time and money.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|I found this not quite as good as the first two but a lot better than I had expected, no doubt I will watch it again, so if you liked the first two you'll like find this one good.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was so much better than I expected. It drew me in from the first page and only got better!
B00000G5VY|4.0|This was a gift for the better half and she loved it as the Eurythmics are very well liked and are very good listening
0439023483|4.0|There is no denying, Suzanne Collins trilogy, beginning with The Hunger Games, has become a cultural phenomenon. Growing up, I can remember the excitement I felt, waiting for the latest Harry Potter novel or movie to be released. Today, with the Twilight series, Hunger Games, the Millennium  Trilogy, even Fifty Shades of Grey, it seems like every series is advertised as the next big phenomenon.  I was hesitant to dive into The Hunger Games, but when a friend provided me with a copy, I decided to give it a shot.<br /><br />The novel takes place in the nation of Panem. Basically, North America has been divided into 12 districts, each serving a specific economic purpose. Each year, in commemoration of the revolution and probably more in an attempt to remind the citizens of the leaders' power, each district is required to send one boy and one girl to participate in a televised battle to the death known as The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Sixteen-year-old Katniss Everdeen, a skilled hunter from the coal mining district 12, finds herself thrust into these games when she volunteers to enter in place of her younger sister. She will have to face career tribute, people who have specifically trained to compete in the games, so she is almost certain the battles will result in her death. Her hunting skills come in handy, however, and with the guidance of Haymitch, a drunken winner of a previous games, she soon becomes a serious contender. But survival isn't easy. To win, she is forced to make life or death decisions, face taking the lives of other, and risk betraying relationships.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the novel. The opening, where much of the backstory and preparation take place, was a bit slow. That being said, the story kicks into an unputdownable gear as the games actually begin. Like any good reality television program, I found myself sucked into the action as it was presented. I did feel that the characters were not as deeply realized as they could have been, but as the first novel in a trilogy, I expect they become more layered in later installments. While The Hunger Games is by no means perfect, it does successfully entertain while still provided clever commentary on social and cultural conventions.they could have been, but as the first novel in a trilogy, I expect they become more layered in later installments.

B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I love this game. cool graphics,  fun mini games,  you do have to pay for full game,  but worth it.
B002RAREAK|2.0|for someone to say usher can be the next michael jackson i expected more but this cd is barely passing.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I would highly recommend this book and have already done so. It gripped me from page one and held my attention to the end. I felt great compassion for the parents of this boy and what they went through. I wasn't as sympathetic of Jacob. He didn't seem to fully realize just how much his father and mother gave of themselves for him.
B0015519VS|2.0|this cd is ok usher music is like many other stars they have a good hit or two than the rest of the cd is wack.
B001NLKT60|4.0|This is another edge of your seat thriller by Stieg Larsson. Be ready for a lot of twist, turns, and excitement. Slander discovers the true meaning of friendship and loyalty while continual being exposed to deceit, false accusations, and a fight for power. Get ready for a great action packed adventure.
B003TSEEDY|1.0|I do not write reviews for books that often but this book hardly counts as a masterpiece and it needs to be said.<br /><br />First of all, Charlie is not a wallflower. He seems like he is mentally retarded but he is not a wallflower. He sees things but he doesn't understand anything which makes him come off as mentally retarded. He has no problems with making friends and going to parties.<br /><br />Sam and Patrick are one-dimensional characters and actually, every single character in this book is one-dimensional.<br /><br />My main problem is that this kid goes from being a loner to being the center of attention and a druggie in the short time of a year and there are no problems. There are no internal struggles or anything. It doesn't seem realistic and it doesn't make sense.<br /><br />Don't waste your money. I honestly wish I could unbuy it but I can't.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love my ability to read from my phone.  The actual Kindle was another story.  My daughter's purchased the Kindle for my birthday 1.5 years ago.  I've had to have it replaced three times in one year!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|The beginning is good but the time of when he<br />starts to find the killer and gold bars is<br />very boring.<br />His other books have move action.
1455502758|3.0|Let me begin by disclosing a few facts.  First, I have not been a follower of Christopher Hitchens over the years.  Second, I am, as someone once described me, \\"a believer\\". Finally, I have never felt it necessary to attack anyone who does not believe.  Years of seeking have taught me that you either get it, or you don't and that living a fulfilling, honest life is the point anyway.  Hitchens' life seems to have reflected that thought and was the one connecting point for me with him.<br /><br />Somehow, though, this book annoyed me. \\"Give it up!\\", I thought more that once.  \\"You don't have to believe, but do you have to be so snide about it?\\"  The fending off of faith had a smell of fear and uncertainty.  \\"Be at peace.\\" I wanted to say. \\"Ignore the freaks who wish you to die in agony.  That's not religion.  It's the snap, crackle, pop of knee-jerk dogma.<br /><br />Being a seeker of understanding, I need to explore Hitchens' writing to see what I might have missed.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The ending was great and I was satisfied. This trilogy was wonderful  although engaging, although the first book was the best.
B005K01VZS|5.0|Outstanding read. Even for nonreligious. You will enjoy every story in these pages. It will motivate you to be a better person, especially to your family.
B0063IH60K|5.0|The movement of the cards is very natural.  The game is easy to use and I think I'm less likely to suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome than when playing on the laptop.  I haven't had any problems with ads popping up outside of this application.  A new ad will appear every time you redeal, but since the game is free that's to be expected.
B008476HBM|4.0|I found the book to be very interesting. It drew me into to story. I would defiantly read it again.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie was terrific at the theaters, but I like it even more at home on my 3D TV with the kid.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|This game app needs an update because every time I open the app all my previous food that I had on my counters are gone. I don't even let any customers in so how is that happening? It's so frustrating! Please fix it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|A must see  if you love the series ! Can't wait for the second half of season. Purchased from Amazon...so cool...NO COMMERCIALS !
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|My 5 yr. Old bro plays this game constantly I play it some times but it's a really good game. Here's some other games I recommend : fruit ninja, angry birds, pudding monster, and last but not least this game. This game is on my top three games it second my first is hungry shark (1,2,and,3)
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love this series. I can't get enough. I enjoy the different characters and costumes are great. it has me hooked
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I tried this free version. There isn't anything wrong with it, but there are only a couple alarm tones and clock-face displays. Because it worked well, I decided to buy the full-feature version. $2 seemed reasonable.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game and all of the other games I just got for my new Kindle fire.  It is great and I love playing it.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is fun! A lot more challenging than the other terrestrial games. Varying gravity, Jedi-powered birds... you can go nuts finding off-the-wall ways to take out all them nasty piggies.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I got this game because I love to play it on my computer.  It is very fun to play and I enjoy it alot.
B00275EGX8|5.0|When &#34;Zero Dark Thirty&#34; came out, I realized I should see Katherine Bigelow's first major work. This is a great documentary-style drama. Jeremy Renner is perfect as the bomb-disposal guy with PTSD.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|I would recommend this product to anyone who loves Adele.  She is a great singer and I love listening to her.
B003EYVXTQ|5.0|[[ASIN:B003EYVXTQ Winter's Bone [Blu-ray]]] is just a great minimalist movie. This is a gritty, no-frills look at the devastation crystal meth, aka \\"crank,\\" has on rural populations where it is cooked. Apparently crank is the new moonshine.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence really shines as the oldest child trying to hang onto her family house after her father, one of many local cookers, disappears, and the bail bondsman comes a-callin' for his money. Her Academy Award nomination was well deserved - she flat-out nails her part without overwhelming the supporting (no-name) cast. Great direction.<br /><br />I would encourage people to not pay attention to the negative reviews here - \\"Winter's Bone\\" is a movie you have to pay attention to. I suspect the negative reviews come from folks who found it got in the way of their texting...
B000N2HBSO|4.0|I'm used to reading murder mysteries, so this is more difficult to read. But it is fascinating. It feels like watching history from street level rather than up at 30,000 feet.
B002ZG98J6|3.0|If you are buying this video after reading the book and are expecting an adaptation into a movie you will be sorely dissapointed, The only thing the movie and book have in common are the title and the characters names. The plot of the movie deviates widley from the book. The movie wouldn't be bad if I hadn't read the book first but I was let down having read the book first. Buyer Beware!!!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I bought 5 of these for less than I paid for 1 of WalMart's brand batteries and these are Energiser brand
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am speechless best thing I ever read! It was well written great storyline and characters I am impressed! Amazing!!!!
B00AFWEPVI|4.0|Anther great product for my kindle fire. It removes the need to lug a digital camera on my business and vacation trips
0399246665|2.0|I didn't like any of the art in the books. I didn't like how the pages are divided in half. The object is to find bottom page that matches the top page. It may be a good idea in theory, but pretty bad in real life. I just wanted some books to read to my 4-month-old. I just wanted a numbers book that went from 1 to 10 in order. The books are more like flash cards except instead of having a back and front, they have a top and bottom section. If you want flash cards, buy flash cards. If you want some books, buy something else.
B0011Z32PS|5.0|would buy like this again been waiting for this for a while now and it is as good as i thought
B009SMW9IW|5.0|Leave it to Tracey Thorn to make the most unexpected Christmas album ever. Melancholy, wistful and beautiful. The covers are spot on (esp. &#34;Sister Winter&#34;) and the new song &#34;Joy&#34; is exactly that. Brava, Tracey!
B006LSZECO|5.0|To be my first thriller that I read it is pretty good. Although you know from the title the main topic of the book, the twists and turns plus the writing technique make the story amazing.
B001EN71CW|5.0|...and still a 5-star average. There's not much I can add, is there? I have the original series on DVD (multiple copies), and got this at a low point in its price history. Totally worth it if you love the show, totally not if you don't.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Sexual chick flick. Easy to read but very badly written. If you want some sexual spice in your life read it.
1451695195|4.0|First 90% was very interesting and comforting description of the journey and the time leading to it.  Eventually the writing became a bit too philosophical and became monotonous.  Overall, a good read.
B008HT4FUW|5.0|Great series can't wait for next season. Need more shows like this instead of the \\"reality\\"shows. Looking forward to see what happens to mary
B00884GR0W|3.0|downloaded and played okay on my original kindle. I also would like to state I am a big fan of minecraft and have owned the Pc version since it was in beta and a lot less complicated. that said block story has a story line which I do like - what I don't like is the crappy controls and confusing instructions - I was very glad that this was the free app today as I didn't want to buy it. I am happy to have it for free and will take my time fooling with it. I would like to know why all the faotd reviews were buried as well as any critical ones (they are the ones I look for first - I want to read real reviews not fluff ones)
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love the binaural beat options and all the sound options that can be mixed and matched.  I can set the timer and relax.  Excellent!
B009H7SCMA|5.0|'Gabriella'is the story of a spoiled and gorgeous rich girl who meets her match on the cricket field in the form of a younger working class guy called Jim.  Gabriella is very sexually experienced and Jim is a virgin.  Sparks fly from the second their eyes meet and so begins the game.<br /><br />In the first few pages I was sort of reminded of the movie 'Caddyshack', but only because of the obvious class divide & the sporting back drop.  'Gabriella' is something totally different and, dare I say, in a 'class' of it's own.  The characters were enjoyable to read about.  I liked Jim right away, and I think it was because he irritated Gabriella.  I wasn't so keen on her, but by about half way through whether I liked them stopped mattering and I just wanted to see what was going to happen next.<br /><br />The whole thing from beginning to end was over-the-top outrageous and extreme.  The amount of crotch grabbing alone was shocking!  But this was why it was so brilliant.  Hardy has created a novel that reads like a something lifted out of a nymphomaniac compulsive liar's school diary.  It's unique, it's funny and it's completely scandalous!<br /><br />I picked this up and had to finish it in the same day.  It's that good.  I was very impressed by the originality & I look forward to more from this author.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|This Book is 5 Stars..Their were words that I've never Thought would be in here. I was surprised that many slang words were presented in the \\"The New Oxford American Dictionary\\"!!

1409144720|4.0|DI John Rebus the most famous fictional Scottish detective returns. Has he changed, not a bit! It seems Rebus has been working in the 'old crimes not solved division', the cold case squad as a civilian. He hates it, but it is work. On one fine day he finds himself talking to a mother of a long missing daughter. She brings info, and at the same time, a new young woman goes missing.<br /><br />  Ahhhh, Rebus has worked his way into working with the old unit, and his good friend,  DS Siobhan Clarke.  She is the only one who really welcomes him back, even though he is still a consultant. However, as time does not stand still, Ian Rankin's new character DI Malcom Fox, heading The Ethics and Standards Division' makes his appearance,and he is shocked, shocked,,I tell you, to find Rebus back on the force. He dredges up all the old complaints, none of which went anywhere when Rebus was on the force. The cat and mouse game continues. I actually resented Fox in this novel, at first...<br /><br />We get to meet Rebus's daughter as he travels to the north of Scotland on this case. He is trying to resurrect their relationship.  We also see a great deal of Scotland, the north country and get to meet the people. This is a time when Scotland is attempting to exert it's independence, and we see the issues from all sides. The mystery of the abduction turns into a serial killer, and Rebus immerses himself into the case. This is a fascinating study of a man who was let out to pasture, trying to regain his foothold. Rebus has not changed much, his habits remain the same, but I do detect a little empathy in the man. He is trying to  deal with the changes in the workplace and the computerization of his workplace.<br /><br />It must be that Ian Rankin missed Rebus as much as we did, the music, the whiskey, the man who pays little attention to the niceties of life.  There are some tell tale signs that Rebus might be working with his unit again.. Rebus we missed Ye, welcome home!<br /><br />Highly Recommended.  prisrob 01-12-13ighly Recommended.  prisrob 01-12-13

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very out standing book. Service was excellent, received book right away. It was very easy to order right on the device.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|This book details the effort and sacrifices that go into everyday freedom. More people should understand the great job that our military people do everyday. This book captures their efforts and accomplishments.

0547260695|5.0|I bought this for my nephew after seeing it in Anthroplogie. It's a classic story, re-imagined in a pop-up book. Well-conceived, and well-made, and utterly adorable!

B0099G3I96|1.0|As a fan of the original no doubt i was highly disappointed in this. I had heard some bad reviews, but wanted to see for myself because i was excited to see them back together. Save yourself the money and skip this. Its is slow and not typical of no doubt.
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|I've read every Pendergast novel. Gradually he's become a more and more unrealistic character (not that he was ever particularly believable), but the stories were inventive and fun, so we forgave the authors their silly excesses. It's fiction, after all, and writers get to create their own worlds. But \\"Two Graves\\" is a colossal miscalculation. I don't think I've ever been more furious at a book. For the first two thirds of this trilogy, centered around Pendergast's late (?) wife, the authors built suspense, developed characters, and gradually framed a fairly interesting story, only to then crush and obliterate that story in the first 50 pages of book three. I wish I was exaggerating. Almost from the start, the reader is left with only one or two loose strands of extremely thin plot line to connect the first two installments with \\"Two Graves\\".  After the story as the reader knows it has been dispatched, it becomes clear Preston & Child intend to use the rest of the book to lay out four separate plot lines, none of which appear to have much to do with each other, are barely connected to the rest of the trilogy, and cannot be reconciled without completely suspending logic and rationality. The authors must have had a VERY strict deadline.<br /><br />Preston and Child remain gifted writers, but reading \\"Two Graves\\" is an exercise in patience and forgiveness. I'll likely read the next Pendergast book all the same, but I will not buy it. When it comes out, on a subsequent visit to my local library, if I remember, I'll grab it on my way out the door.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|I loved this movie as a child growing up in the 90s and now my 4 year old gets to appreciate this series as well. Wonderful.
B000SGRONM|2.0|I was not familiar with David Sedaris' humor, and turns out it's not really my style.  I did find the first short story interesting, but the rest of the book was boring and/or I didn't get it.  Why did he publish this book?  It must be popular, as this is a new version with more stories that the prior edition.<br /><br />I guess you have to be a Sedaris fan for this one.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The opening of Season 3 was everything I expected.  This show is so well done and well acted that you can't wait for the next episode!  It is so easy to get very invested in the characters.  My favorite is Maggie Smith.  She steals every scene she is in.
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I was so sad to see the show end, as I did not know about it at first, once I started watching it was hooked and glad now to own it so can see all the episodes from beginning to end
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I love this series!  I recommend this series to all!  If you like read series than this is a very good one to read.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have been enjoying this series since the beginning...love it love it  love it.  Can't wait til it arrives, when will that be?
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Having just read his latest book this summer, I wasn't sure what to expect from this MUCH earlier novel. It's surprising how consistent (and delightful) Scalzi has been. The story moves along at a zippy pace, with vivid descriptions, snappy dialogue and a lot of humor with just the right number of sucker punches. You care about the characters, root for them, and genuinely feel the loss when war inevitably takes its toll. Top notch entertainment.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Never had known about this book by Dickens, what a great discovery and ever so well done, loved it and would recommend
B001CDLAT4|5.0|Baraka is an incredible feast for the eyes and soul! I can't wait for its companion film, Samsura, to become available! It'll render you speechless!
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game great better then the other zoo game I played the olny thing I hate the baby's don't move.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Awesome story that pulls you in, twists the plot and follows with a resolving ending. Definitely recommended for just about anyone.
B005LAIIA8|3.0|I think Frankenweenie is a cute film.  Sure, it has it's flaws.  I wish what happened with the science teacher was resolved and I felt bad for \\"Weird girl\\" because I don't think Mr. Whiskers deserved his fate. I kind of hoped Mr. Whiskers would disappear from his staking as he was a homage to Dracula, and maybe hint that he was still alive.  Ah, well.<br /><br />Now my biggest complain is the DVD / BluRay.  Why are there more features on the Blu Ray? I know, I know. You will tell me that there is more space on a Blu Ray disc than DVD.  And some of you might laugh and tell me to upgrade (my computer can only play DVD but I have a BluRay player attached to my TV).  I'll get comments like \\"LOL. I have that same problem with my VHS tapes! Why don't they have all the bonus materiel?!\\"  But listen up, kiddies.  Go back in time just five years or so and you'll find that DVDs used to come with a LOT more bonus material than just one featurette while all the good stuff is on the BluRay.<br /><br /> In fact the 2003 Nightmare before Christmas DVD has the short film of Frankenweenie, the short for Vincent, behind the scenes making of footage, deleted scenes, and commentaries, and more.  Yet today from Disney the Frankenweenie DVD only has one featurette and the short film version has to be watched on the Blu Ray.  Why!?  There's plenty of room on the DVD.  In fact that DVD has a LOT of blank space on it because of how much they left off.  It's like using an extended play DVD disc to hold a 400 MB AVI of a half hour cartoon you found on Youtube.  It doesn't make sense!  It would not have cost Disney more money to put the same features on the DVD because they wouldn't require more space than is already on those discs.  The DVD has lots of space, check for yourself.  They're like large bottles with only a few drops of water in them.  Why are they doing this?  Well, very simply, just to twist your arm into converting to Blu Ray.  I would give a higher rating if Disney didn't feelthe need to treat us like this.
0061914177|5.0|It book is a very good book to read and it is very clear on how to execute the plan to start your business, or even to get it off the ground. the group that I had bought from are very good and the service was very fast. would buy again.

B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Made me want to learn more about Tesla coils. I enjoyed having to go from one scene to another. Mini puzzles were good too.

B000SEGUDE|5.0|Cool Book.  Kids loved it.  Well written.  My son could not put it down.  Read it cover to cover in 2 days.
B009B8YZIK|5.0|Ignore the reviews that say you can get this on waypoint for free. You can get the episodes but no comparison to plugging it into the DVD player and watching it non-stop. My son also said there was content that was edited out of the waypoint episodes.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Good book.  Well written.  My son loved it and read it cover to cover in a few days.  Well worth it.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Just got caught up to current on this series and I love it.  I love the characters and twists and turns in the story.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Good book.  Well written.  My son loved it and read it cover to cover in a few days.  Well worth it.

B000Q9EPUG|5.0|Good book.  Well written.  My son loved it and read it cover to cover in a few days.  Well worth it.

B0053TMP24|5.0|Good book.  Well written.  My son loved it and read it cover to cover in a few days.  Well worth it.
B009IF8CH6|4.0|I love TBBT, but had missed a few shows earlier in this season, so I found them on Amazon and downloaded them.  Love the series! I purchased the episodes, so the only thing that irks is that, when I record them at home, I do it so I can skip commercials.  I'd like that same option after I've purchased them, but that is not the way it works, I guess.
B001BC2ZS6|5.0|One of the best books of all time.  My son loved it and read it cover to cover in a few days.  I just re-read it again.  Loved it even more the second time reading it as an adult!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a good app but u have to unlock the other games but it is fun.woo if u want a review for this games this is the one download it!!!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Good book.  Well written.  My son loved it and read it cover to cover in a few days.  Well worth it.
B005CRQ2XA|4.0|I liked the book and it was very funny  and it was just like the movie loved the movie and the book
B000TO0TCQ|5.0|Good book.  Well written.  My son loved it and read it cover to cover in a few days.  Well worth it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have always enjoyed playing solitaire as far back as I can remember.  The format is easy to use and flows well.
B000TO0T4O|5.0|Good book.  Well written.  My son loved it and read it cover to cover in a few days.  Well worth it.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Angry Birds<br />It is a great game.  I enjoy playing it immensely.  The only downside, is when in the middle of the game it quite frequently goes to a screen where you are asked to also purchase another game.  This is annoying and it would be better if this did not occur so often.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Good book.  Well written.  My son loved it and read it cover to cover in a few days.  Well worth it.
B0086700CM|4.0|I really like this game, but I think that when you have the invisibility power up, you should not be able to be attacked by the monkeyish things.<br />And most of the things cost unreasonably high...but other than that it is a great game
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Come on, it can't get much cooler than my favorite movies as a kid in a box set and blu ray at that.
1466401885|5.0|I thought I would not love anyone more than Christian but God, Travis is just irresistible! I had to read this twice and may read again later! Fantastic! I am so excited to read Walking Disaster. Can't wait.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So amazing. I loved it. I look forward to reading more by this author. Wonderful writing and very emotional. I really felt with the characters.
B005S9ELVC|4.0|1/11/2013 - - - This movie just came out and is absolutely FANTASTIC !  Sean Penn gives one of his best performances ever - - the role of Mickey Cohen was made for Penn !  Ryan Gosling, grizzled and a sober Nick Nolte and Emma Stone were great supporting actors.  The action is there - - great settings - - stellar sound and production.  It's a thrill of a ride...GO SEE IT !
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Great job by Rod Stewart and o thers who joined in  putting this album together.  Would buy for a gift too.
B00ANT6OK8|5.0|1/12/2013 - - - I just saw the premier of this movie tonight, and I walked away just ABSOLUTELY impressed in all phases !  Even though it is only January, I predict this movie wins Best Picture !  Jessica Chastain deserves an Oscar for her riviting performance.  The attention to detail in this movie was incredible - - from the Special Ops guys to the following the clues and breadcrumbs, that ultimately led to bin Laden....just SUPERB !  I highly HIGHLY recommend this movie !!  The tenseness and chills builds slowly throughout the movie....just absolutely amazing how this true story unfolds into taking down the worst and most evil terrorist the world has ever known.  Go see this movie - - in fact, when it becomes available, you will want to BUY THIS MOVIE !  Simply, it's THAT GOOD people !!
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|Don't know what it is like as it will not open on my Kindle.  Heard it was good on the Ellen show, and wanted to try it.  Can't find it to open.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I just thought i'd share my love for these movies, and im glad I finally have all 3 in amazing HD, to view whenever I please.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|So many hidden gems of wisdom!!!! It will all be alright in the end. And, if it's not alright, it's not the end!!!!
B00138CYD4|4.0|A great album, with most of his great hits on the album. Makes you want to sing along. Brings back memories from the 70s
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|I think the graphics, music, etc., in this game are excellent. I would give this app 5 stars if not for having to purchase it in the middle of the game. G5, if you are teaming with Amazon to offer a free app of the day, please make the whole thing free. I know you are a business and are in it to make a profit, however, be sincere when making an offer instead of teasing potential customers.
159562015X|4.0|Haha, I know my strengths aren't supposed to be a surprise to me, but they were. I wish it weren't a one-time authentication code because I'm kind of... unsure about if my strengths are really as they say.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|A bit like La Ronde where each chapter is a new character, someone we've previously met conventionally. At times gorgeous, at other times infuriating. But overall a good read.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|Despite some of the criticism this Fifth Season has received, I think that the episodes were excellent, the writing was consistently good, and the characters were moved forward and more deftly layered.  I actually wrote a blog about the season on one of my blogs: [...]<br /><br />I'm looking forward to the sixth season.
B006MW3V6U|1.0|After a wonderful first season, the second season of Downton Abbey was a terrible disappointment.  The story lines became more and more facile and unbelievable, the characters less and less interesting -- it absolutely generated into bad soap opera.  After the first year's stellar quality, it was (or should have been) an embarrassment.<br /><br />I know others have already begun watching season three, but I have no intention of spending another moment -- wasting any more time -- on this series.  Once a series loses its way in such a disappointing and ruinous way, I doubt that it will regain its footing.  I suspect that is why the magnificent Dame Maggie Smith is leaving after this season -- I wouldn't want to be associated with it anymore, either.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Haven't read a book this good in a long time!!! Very good plot with unexpected twists. Can't wait for the movie!!!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely loved Safe Haven. It showed a very realistic view of an abused woman and the struggles to freedom. If you're a Nicholas Sparks fan its a must read.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Found this book entertaining. unfortunately it was a quick read. I never realized how many pirate references that are used today came from this book
030758836X|2.0|Yes, the plot is intriguing (although) formulaic in execution at times.  Its characters sneer at &#34;Midwestern&#34; values and all the f-bombs and references to threesomes etc. left me feeling soiled after reading.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I read this book a few years ago and was enjoyed the original vampire. This changed my perspective on Who Van Helsing really was and how Vampires should be
B006RXPUR2|5.0|This is Ben Affleck's directorial debut, what an impressive acheivement. The story is from the Dennis Lehane novel, good performances by Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan, with great supporting actors Morgan Freeman and Ed Harris. Fans of The Office will be shocked to see Amy Ryan's portrayal of the uncaring and manipulative mother of the missing girl. Full of twists and turns, the story keeps you involved until the end.
B002WIDRM6|4.0|love the album but the case is toast! It's totally shattered, I'll have to find another case. Cd is good shape and plays well
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I had high expectations for this book; not only were they met they were exceeded. This book is so well written, so breathtaking, so perfect!<br /><br />I couldn't put it down for two reasons:<br />1) the first half of the book because I was dying to know what would happen with Holder and Sky and their blossoming relationship. Ms. Hoover is so fantastic at evoking the same emotions of the main characters and the reader. I felt like it was me as Sky.<br />2) The second half of the book literally blew me away. The way the book came to an end and how everything from the first half of the book made complete sense with the second half.<br /><br />I can not recommend this book enough. Its an easy read, I couldn't put it down!
B0093OGBL6|2.0|* The book is not a biography, it's mostly about MJ's last years.<br />* There is no new information about MJ, except the parts where his bodyguards talks about him.<br />* Very poor research.<br />* Much of the sources are from tabloids, like TMZ, Radar Online, Topix ... and fan sites (MJ Fan Club etc)...<br />* The author is not so much objective, she is a fan, she is passionate about him.<br />* The author is not a MJ expert.<br />* There are a lot of the mistakes.<br />* There is a lot of things that she missed (from MJ's trial, and last years)/<br />* She has not used a court documents.<br />* She has not used documents like autopsy report, final will, medical records etc.<br />* There is only a few people that she has interviewed (and some of them had no contact with MJ at all in the last years of his life).<br /> *and so many other things.<br /><br />Because all of this, I'm giving 2 stars. Enough!
B002KGKH5A|3.0|The production is good, and the timeline/narration is good, But none of the songs played are full length.<br /> Meg is so cute.She raised review from dont like it, to &#34;it's OK&#34;.
B00ATSBIIG|3.0|Beautiful graphics but there is no real challenge other than the &quot;challenge&quot; stage at the end of each set. The sets themselves can be solved rather quickly. An option to put the puzzles together from scratch might improve this game and make it worth paying for.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I think I would suggest it to others. The immersed reading function was a total plus. Very Good job done.
B00499LTLM|5.0|We love this British Sherlock!  He and Dr. Watson skillfully, playfully, and sometimes hysterically catch criminals who were thought to be incapable of being caught.  The show is so well written, and acted, we are totally addicted!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Very interesting read, it is targeted at young adults but anyone can enjoy this. A soon to be classic and and a great intro book for people looking to enter the sci fi genre
B0086700CM|5.0|Great time killer to pick up and put down at will. Love it in the doctor's waiting room. Fun characters, challenging objectives.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Excellent work. I was worried the series was going to be ended soon but Martin has managed to make each book more exciting than the last. I am especially eager to see how he brings daenerys home. A and of course we finally have gotten dragons.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|If you love How I Met Your Mother then you must have it on DVD. Best part is not having to wait or fast forward though commercials.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read every Harry Bosch novel, and Michael Connelly never misses a beat writing about him.  He gets you pulled into the story line quickly and you don't want to put the kindle down until you finish it.  You will not be disappointed reading this novel.  If this is the first time you have read Michael Connelly you will want to read all the Harry Bosch books, if you do download the list from his website and read them in order because they are what I would consider a continuation series.  I almost forgot to mention the Lincoln lawyer books are a part of the series.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|I have had this item for a few weeks and have watched it twice! booyahh! It is legendary and classical.
B008NMT684|3.0|It's cute but very short there are only like 4 puzzles. But my twins loved it. You can buy more puzzles.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Truly was glued to book until I finished - at which point I reread several chapters. I was left a little dumbfounded at the end but it all made sense and was a wonderfully written book
1594484813|5.0|This was a gift for my wife, who loves books on true crime and somewhat unusual people.  She was loved the book, and found it (and the subject of the book) fascinating.
B000V4NX04|5.0|Brilliantly done movie on a serious topic. One warning - can be seriously triggering to those who are affected by sexual violence portrayal.
B005K2YRVG|5.0|Very handy!  Fits my Kindle perfectly, yet is slim-lined enough to slide right into my purse. Cover is sturdy enough to give super protection
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|I don't laugh aloud to a movie very often, but this one had me at least chuckling all the way through. WARNING: This movie is NOT for children of any age. There are many obvious indications of drugs, sex, and alcohol throughout the movie.<br /><br />The humor in this movie is of the distinct style of Seth McFarlane. If you don't enjoy or understand the comedy of shows like Family Guy, you may not enjoy this movie.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|this was the latest in the FBI Agent Pendergast series and one of the best.  He embarks on a mission of revenge and encounters a killer as ruthless and dangerous as himself.  Lots of surprises made this one of the best books in the series!
B004FK24ZA|5.0|The original film is a masterpiece for two reasons. First It is a quiet movie filled with human responses to human problems.<br />Second, Gary Grant has caught the essence of his character as visioned. Gentle, reassuring, comfortable and above all, in compete control. A perfect Christmas movie for adults. Just make sure you get the film without the subtitles.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Without a doubt, Kate Morton at her very best -- poignant, tender and breathtaking.<br /><br />I know of no other writer who  can conceive of such intricate, multilayered stories and then spin them out in such a way that the reader is caught completely unawares.<br /><br />Oh, at first this canny reader is made to feel oh-so-clever at sussing out EXACTLY what's going on while the main characters still stumble in the dark. The reader isn't even particularly disappointed in Ms. Morton's giving up the game this early in the book, because, after all, an ordinary reader probably wouldn't have picked up on those very subtle clues that things were not at all what they appeared on their face. The smug reader instead sits back to enjoy Ms. Morton's richly-textured prose, whilst smugly waiting for the main characters to catch up and peel back the final layer.<br /><br />And when they do, it's almost anticlimactic....but wait...there are pages left to read. Are we to spend another chapter in exhaustive explanation of what this intuitive reader figured out chapters ago? Well, no, because without warning, the main character peels back the actual final layer and the real story comes sharply into  focus for the now sheepish reader who absolutely did not see it coming. Brilliant!
B000I0QL82|3.0|Typical story that just doesn't match reality but works fine at Christmas because we want music and dancing anyway. If you can handle the story  the music and  dance will make you feel good all over.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This particular version is all-inclusive and I'm seeing scenes that were not shown in the original U.S. broadcast.  Impeccable acting, sets, filming... everything is great about this series.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great app and fun game.  Even my 5 year old who loves puzzles has been playing it.  Thank you for this being free.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I am overwhelmed and incredibly fortunate.....I truly can't describe my feelings in regards to this book! I can only speak for myself: an ABSOLUTE must read!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Ever since I picked up the first book to the Hunger Games trilogy, I just couldn't put it down. I was addicted! This book kept me guessing and wondering what would happen next. I applaud Suzanne Collins on writing such a masterpiece. Now I'll be anticipating the movie... Bravo!
B008476HBM|5.0|PRIDE AND PREJUDICE IS MAGIC!! IT IS WITHOUT A DOUBT ONE OF MY FAVORITES. I TRULY LOVE THE WRITINGS OF JANE AUSTEN.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Great app but a lot of the other mine craft  are scams or they put mind in front of craft to trick you. it's like they keep coming out with more and more scams every week
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|I deleted it!!  Didn't like it.  Wouldn't recommend it.  I got 9 more words to say I don't like it!!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|This game is a very fun adventure type game reminds me of the Lord of the rings type of game it's a good game for an android type of device and is really fun to play
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Dexter is one of my favorite shows of all time. I am just amazed by his complexity more with each new episode.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I love to play Mah Jong and have it on my laptop.  I haven't played this one as much because the print is small and hard for me to see.
B000WITSZS|5.0|This album seems to stem from the root of metal such as Black Sabbath and Zepplin. I just love their sound.
B0063IH60K|2.0|I realize that a free app can have ads to help keep the cost down or keep it free, but this one has a new ad for each time the screen changes. The game is still fun, but you do have to work around the ads.
B002SZXSL8|5.0|I love this album. It's a wonderful following from their first work although it is a bit different, it's still just as good.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Cool fun game. Always keeps me entertain when I'm bored I'm sure others will agree. They should make others like this :)
B0028KF4M4|5.0|Dexter is one of my favorite shows of all time. I am just amazed by his complexity more with each new episode.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|David Baldacci does a most excellent job of having the reader become invested with the characters he brings to life in his books! The way he shapes his characters makes you feel like you know them personally. And, this makes you root for them all the more!<br />This is an excellent read!
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Great songs each one on this album. I look forward each week to hearing the new singles they come out with.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|It is an easy size. It is very simple to use.  I like it very much and would recomend it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|this show is amazing. I simply love the whole story line as well as the historical accuracy. As Americans it can be hard to understand English Aristocracy but this show captures it well.
0765325950|5.0|This book has over 800 ratings on goodreads and averages 4.5 stars. That should tell you something!! Those of you who are interested in this book should be smart enough to know that the few whiny people about having to wait a whole 90 days to get the ebook are behaving like kids fighting over a toy. Who ever is leading the charge should be ashamed.  Every book Brandon Sanderson has written has been a 4 star average and this one should be no different. There are many books out that i want that are ebooks only and i am not going out and leading a caimpaign to give them 1 stars for no hard copy available.<br /><br />I read my first Wheel of Time book in 1993 so i was happy to get the final book. It lived up the hype. I was surprised at who died(some are going to be really disappointed at who does not make it), got a little teary eyed a couple of times, and was happy with the ending. So much going on that you dont always get as much of your favorite characters but resolves most storylines. Ignore the Ebook whiners and buy a very good book that has a conclusion 20 years in the making! You wont be disappointed.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Stephen King has done it again.  Haven't we all wondered at one time or another what would have happened if history had been different?  Now he brings that to the front.  Truly a good read.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Every day while I read this book I felt very grateful for my life.<br />It's a must read. Very inspiring.
0316226130|5.0|Came on time - younger sibling loved it - would have preferred getting the dvd instead but this was well received
1451627289|5.0|I am not a Stephen King fan, but I love this book. My mother, husband and book club loved it too. Good gift.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love this series Don't want it to end!!!!!! Going to start the next book now.  Thank goodness for the kindle.
0399237720|5.0|I brought this to a book baby shower and it was very impressive due to its size. It has a convenient handle too of course the story and illustrations make this book a classic.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|I felt the plot in this movie was disjointed -- there really was one main theme at the beginning but then transformed into another &#34;main&#34; plot about half-way through the movie. While the concept was interesting, it didn't play true through the end of the movie to this concept -- even the end felt hurried and weird....I didn't feel that attached to the characters at the end nor really care about the result because it was all over the place.<br /><br />There really is not a need to lace a movie with excessive profanity like this one did -- I understand the use of profanity may be needed to establish a character, but not EVERYONE has to use it ALL the time like this movie did.<br /><br />Also, unnecessary nudity -- this movie had the obligatory strip joint scene, but stuck in a couple of nude shots -- all this did, along with the profanity, was make it an R rated movie.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|This was a nice movie for all to enjoy. Whether you are a sports fan or not it was a good movie. Clint Eastwood and Amy Adams make a good father daughter combination. They play well off each other.
B00005JPAO|5.0|This movie seems to hit on an emotional roller coaster.  A must see movie.  I recommend it  highly.  Thank you
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is absolutely one of the best tv series I have seen in many years and it's friendly enough for younger kids as well!  A unique spin off our most favorite fairytales!!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app it help me get my mind straight I been trying to get a alarm but the didn't work rite this the only that worked for me
B000089QEN|1.0|I was excited to sit down and watch this, but sadly could not get through more than a couple episodes.  Natasha Little is a great Becky Sharp, and the costumes are lovely, but the adaptation is performed as a melodrama, exaggerating everything-- especially everything disgusting.  Most of the characters are disgusting, so most of the time viewing the show was unpleasant.  The music was a bit melodramatic as well.  I hope I never have to listen to it again.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|It's just simple I I love and ill never grow out of it. It shows amazing on the kindle and it's amazing that its only a 1$ to rent it! I don't have to go to red box! Only thing is I wish all the movies were like that!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read both books very quickly... I can't wait for book 3. I really liked 50 Shades but this was better in my opinion. I really felt connected to the characters and felt their pain and anxiety!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is fun and challening.  This game has always been a favorite of mine.  This version is responsive to touch.<br />,
B003L7DK74|5.0|Despite being warned that it wouldn't arrive til after Christmas, it arrived on the 22nd.  Very happy with the product and service.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|have been waiting a long time to see this movie - price was great and it arrived on time in great condition! thanks so much!
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|Maybe I'm more old fashioned than I thought but really couldn't get past the foul language enough to enjoy the comedy. Was it funny? I don't know.
0765325950|5.0|One of the few series I've read with a perfect ending. I have to finish this review and go read it again to make sure I didn't miss anything it was so action packed.
0470913029|4.0|I've been telling people about my new (actually 10,000 year old) diet now for a while. There nothing more to say than what's in my title. It's not necessarily a fantastic book, but the theory seems solid and my results (and my wife's) add weight to the Dr. Cordain's argument. If you follow the rules you'll never feel weighed down after a meal--you'll just feel sated. As a bonus: I had a six-pack less than a month after beginning this diet and continuing with my high-intensity workout 3-4x week.<br /><br />I think the real key to starting something like this is not to say &#34;OK, I'm going to switch to paleo now.&#34; Instead, challenge yourself to cook and eat paleo for a month (and you get 1-3 &#34;cheat&#34; meals a week if you want). If you like your results after a month, keep going, if you don't, you probably learned something new and have a few new recipes.<br /><br />All in all, highly recommended as a life-style and this book is the way to get it started.
B00992CF6W|5.0|ITS AWESOME U CAN BE FRATIVE ITS HQSBA LOT OF UPDATES HUT ITS NOT. LIKE MINECRAFT ON THE COMPUTER BUT ITS STILLL AWESOME AND THE NEXT. UPFATE IE ARMOR SO IF U LIKE ARMOR U WILL LIKE THIS UPDATE
B007L96VCY|5.0|I remember when this came out in 1971 people were still trying to compare every solo release from The beatles members to Beatle albums.And it was weird because even though we liked most of the solo albums in their own right,nothing was ever going to compare to The Beatles records.<br /> In the 1970s,anytime a Beatle came in concert all anyone could think of was:'I wonder if the other Beatles will show up.'This went on, it seemed like forever.That immediatly stopped forever in 1980 when John died.<br />  Well anyway,What I thought back then,and still think today is that Ram is the most Beatlesque sounding record and the best post Beatle album ever.Every song is killer,loaded with 3,4,10 part harmonies.Great musical changes within each song.All I can say is, if you never heard this album or even if your not the biggest Paul or Beatle fan,but you love great 60s early70s rock and psychedelic music,great pop,and even heavy rock, get this album right away.If you realy want to have some fun,listen to it at least one time through headphones.It sounds amazing,and will blow your mind.
B000H8SFMK|5.0|This is one of the better CD's by the Pogues. Their rendition of &#34;Fairytale of New York&#34; is second to none,,a classic. I recommend  as a followup to this disc 'The very best of the Pogues'
B00AKL1XPU|1.0|this app crashes all the time. now it wont even open. this game needs fixing or ill be uninstalling. game great as long as its working.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Probably the best of the 3 movies 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 1 2 3
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What an amazing story had me hooked from begging to end.I think it's a must read. I will recommend it to all my friends
B003THHIEM|5.0|Got this as a gift for my niece, she loves thje show. Maybe the most fun of all the &#34;cop&#34; shows
B000YJ85BI|3.0|I loved the writers concept of the future in the first novel.  I only wish they would continue the series.  Not as humorous but has a slight hitchhikers feel to it.
B00845PV16|1.0|Should have stopped at the first one. This was money that should have never been spent - not just me watching it, them making it
B005V20JKI|5.0|this is the best app I have ever seen in my life so you have to buy this game and it is only 99.&cent;
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Hey, these are the Avengers. The other Justice League. What's not to like. Great comic book fun, I hope they had as much fun making it.
B00884GR0W|3.0|can only play about 15 minutes b4 it sends me to my kindle home screen help me plox I would appreciate it

B009JBZH54|5.0|It was at a good price and great quality. Would recommend to anyone wanting the Batman Trilogy. Great for Gifts!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Great album!  I would encourage everyone to buy it.  All the songs are great. It is awesome!  :))  He is very unique and talented.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I found this story to be very different from anything before.  Her style of writing is very hip and the characters in the book are very interesting, the female is someone that you love to hate. It was an easy read and very hard to put down and the ending surprised me.  Would like to read more like it.
B004FP1WX0|5.0|Mind blowing movie.  Love the characters and especially the ending where the husband explains the theory of catfish..  Brilliantly made movie.  I highly recommend it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Howey is a great writer. I was pleasantly surprised at how good this series was.<br /><br />Gizmodo recommended it since it was on sale, so i bought it. Definitely didn't regret the purchase.<br /><br />The world that Howey has created give a unique look into a post apocalyptic future where we don't even remember what it was like to be in the outside world.<br /><br />Great read, you won't be disappointed.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This is no high-end knife sharpener but it has served me well so far. This isn't for all knives, as it does it's best work with smaller blades. It did put a great edge on 5 different EDC's that I have and is easy to use. I read some negative reviews on this item but I think those were from people that expected way too much from this little tool. Is it the best? No, but it did meet my expectations.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Very nice case. Not bulky like some can be. The hard cover for the screen works great and we have never had a problem with a damaged Kindle.<br /><br />The elastic strap works well for keeping it closed too.<br /><br />Very happy.
0783225733|5.0|I love the historical facts in the movie.  It helped us to understand more about the fact that space is dangerous, and that miracles happen.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Interesting, fast paced, unique, well acted. Much like a typical mystery shows, the creators can just sort of conjure the solution to mysteries at the end of each episode. With Sherlock though, you get to see more of the peices as they come together so when you learn the solution at the end, it doesn't fee like a cheap trick.
B000YABS8E|5.0|I like the fact that it shows that treating people nice and having morals is much more attractive than that violent bad, macho man.  It really is good.
0545305497|5.0|Good books. Although they are primarily written for teenagers, I still loved the series, just like the Harry Potter series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book. Yea, it's another fictional murder mystery but the way in which it is written...in two view points, each chapter makes you keep turning the pages.  It's excellent!!!!
034580404X|5.0|Good books! I enjoyed reading the first one. And although I haven't read the last 2 yet, I'm expecting them to be equually as good as the first one.
B003JH8LPW|3.0|I selected this book also because of a recommendation from Lindsay Tanner's &#34;Pleasure between the Covers&#34;.  It'd easy to read, but tends to drag in places and the ending is fairly predictable.  But it certainly was easy to read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|really got to know the characters and enjoyed it as much as HUGERGAMES<br />OI HAVE RECOMENDED IT TO ALL MY FRIENDS
B006POGWB6|1.0|BEWARE: this is not US region, nor region free. The Blue ray disk will NOT play on the us blue-ray players. Returned it. I wish I could watch it in 3d.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|i enyoyed the trilogy as a complete work. this one did not hold my interedt like the other two that i absolutrely loved!
B008M87GJK|4.0|At least I get something other than just US news.  They ask for a review and then they telll you how many words to write.  Assinine way of doing things
B006TJXZ30|4.0|I love being able to get my E-mail when we are on vacations.. Many places now have Wi Fi that you can keep up with the mail while you are gone.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|As an avid reader and published Kindle author, I admittedly have not previously read anything on WWII history. That is, until someone suggested I read \\"A Higher Call\\". Folks, this book, at least for me, was difficult to put down. First and foremost, it's a true story. The characters in the story aren't the result of a creative author; they lived the story. Beyond that though, the story is laid out beautifully. It's riveting to say the least. I titled my review \\"I was THERE!\\" because that's where the author placed me. I could see the events as they unfolded in the story, I could smell the cockpit of the aircraft and I could feel the fear, dwarfed only by their bravado, of the personnel on both sides. Thanks to this book, I now have a different view of the WWII enemy I had previously come to know only through history books. From their belief that they were doing the right thing to their own personal relationships with God. And to think, after all the years, bloodshed and nightmares, these warriors could look beyond that and call each other friends.<br /><br />AWESOME story, well told, highly recommended!
B008M721MS|5.0|Just amazed why companies ask for reviews when I am just registering a new product. I am excited we will have skype technology with a new device, but I have not actually tried the product yet.
B00A0L7PE8|5.0|This is a first taste of the new album from prince. The songs show once more how creative and versatile he is. This collection is different versions of the same song, some of them very impressive and completely new for Prince (electronic, club sound). I like the songs, even my wife who is not so much into Prince, got the groove with Rock'n Roll Love Affair. I'll keep on waiting on the new album while listening to this pre-release.
B0043RSK3K|4.0|I gave the book 4 stars because I hope the book isn't entirely accurate. If it is you can't come away withouit being extremely disappointed in the leaders of this country. The continuos, stupid, costly mistakes are unbelievable. War seemed to be the answer to everything at the cost of many young lives. I was in the Viet Nam war & lost many a friend over one of the all time stupid wars not with standing Iraq & Afghanistan. It leaves you feeling a little dirty.
B004LWZWGK|2.0|This was a Christmas gift for my 9 year old grandson.  He got bored and wandered away when it was about half over.  My daughter, son-in-law and I watched it all the way through, and though it was very confusing, and not particularly good.
B008X8QCTO|4.0|I knew about the extra 99 cent charge, so wasn't bothered by it.  I thought this was a very good game for two dollars. Thr story line was okay, but a bit weird and unresolved.  Both the main story and the bonus game were longer than I expected them to be.  My only complaint is that there was a little to much hand -holding in that you'd always find a tool exactly when you needed it and some of the puzzles were more difficult then they should have been.  Thankfully,  there was little wait for the &quot;skip&quot; option.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|As I said in my review of Mulholland Dive, I am definitely a Michael Connelly fan, but don't believe the short story genre gives the author the opportunity to really flesh out the story.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|this book wound itself around my heart so gently that i didn't realize i was captured, until i couldn't break away, and then i didn't want to. Every emotion i contain was played, and even after reading the last word, i am sitting here and remembering.  What a good frigin book!
B008LY9AWG|4.0|As a Michael Connelly fan, I enjoyed the stories. The only reason I gave them a 4 is because short stories don't give one the opportunity to really flesh out the story.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Wouldn't buy for awhile due to the price .Excellent read like most of Grisham's books --keeps you interested and curious as to the outcome
B009OYTAL8|5.0|Arrow wasn't what I expected.  I thought it would be another cheesy take on a DC Comic superhero, but was pleasantly surprised with the mature and sometimes dark story line.  Outstanding new show!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Excellent read ,holds your interest well--similar to Baldacci's other novels.I would recommend this book --more especially if the price has been reduced.Some of the new releases are too pricey and with 2 authors now ,the quality of some has diminished and aren't worth it .
B000R4SMCW|5.0|This is an excellent movie....Love all the characters......Has a great ending.....which is what we all look for when watching a movie.....
B0086700CM|5.0|you. cant win but it doesn't matter.  you will keep playing to see if you go someplace you haven't seen before.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|Much better than the first one really like the twists in the movie go ahead and rent it and enjoy...
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book was entertaining. Just wish there wasn't so much repetition. The author could of used a little more variation.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|I'm a big fan now! The band, vocals and songs just rock and swing so excellently. I'll be on the look-out for the next Imelda May album.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|This is a great gift to business professionals or for a college student embarking on their B.S. or Master's degree. It is unnecessary for Associates degrees.
B000050HTO|5.0|30 songs for $10! Great value with classic hits from Dylan! I would definitely recommend for anyone that enjoys Bob Dylan and wants a general overview of his songs.
B002GYI9C4|5.0|A gripping story that created the desire to fill one's self with more of the story as one read on.  Delightfully warm as a mind wrap.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Cannot stop thinking about this book and the characters !!!! I have read it twice! There is a good story in this series. For me, an education as well! Haha
B0098460O4|5.0|Absolutely LOVE this album! Both of their voices are perfect together! Jonathan's voice is like thunder and Charlotte's is like a butterfly flying through the perfect storm that they create together. If you love opera, this is a must in your collection!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Most free games annoy huge ads that sometimes continue to pester outside of the game envelope. This is a free fun app that doesn't trash your experience. It might be too easy at lower levels. If that is the case just jump to a higher level.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Love this book!  I always love anything by Nicholas Sparks, and this was a great read.  Definitely recommend it to friends.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game in the world to me! But I sometimes get scared because of the time HEROBRINE came to my village!he tried to take my diamonds but he couldn't find any.he disappeared and reappeared at my spawn point. Then he came back to kill me but my brother came at that moment and HEROBRINE  saw he was outnumbered so he disipered and never came back .............so far.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Best book I have ever read! Could not put it down once I got into it. Absolutely breath taking, especially at the end!
B008CPZNL6|4.0|Excellent summary of up-to-date news on a variety of subjects that you won't necessarily read in the newspaper.  Easy to use.
B000B8IA2G|5.0|If you liked SG-1, you'll probably like the whole SA series. It's nice to see some of the SG-1 team pop in now and then, but we like this team and series as well.<br />Lots of interesting new characters and good plots with some humor thrown in.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Wonderful! This book is a must-read. A true classic with a meaning of love and sacrifice. God's grace flows through the entire novel.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|My husband and I are really big si-fi fans and have always enjoyed all the Star Trek movies and TV series.  This movie is full of terrific speicial effects, interesting plot twists, lots of surprises and plenty of humor.  It's a must have for anyone who is even remotely qualified as a &#34;Trekkie&#34;.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen's done it again! Slammed was great & Hopeless was an awesome book.  Very well written & it definitely keeps you hooked!
B000HEWEE4|5.0|Interesting story line and two of my favorite actors.  What's not to like?  This one will leave you feeling all mushy inside.
B007TXN4TK|4.0|Great idea.  Kinda helps teach you how to play piano.  Some songs are free but most require the full download.  It is a neat program though.  Not much else to say.  It has different modes.  Some harder than others.
B004856SQ8|5.0|If you liked the series, you'll like the movie.  Great plot, terrific humor, good special effects and non-stop action.  Love it!
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Liam Neeson is in a car wreck and can't remember anything about himself.  Is he who people say he is, or are the memories that are starting to come back really his?  Take a ride with Liam as he regains his memory.  Many twists and turns.  With an ending that will surprise even some of the best movie guessers.  Kinda along the lines of movies like Taken, Taken 2 that he has done.  Overall a very good movie.
B000FCKC4M|5.0|I very have a bias for COELHO books...  I am reading them all..<br />This one was a perfect size to me and enjoyed the reading
B007J4T2G8|5.0|this book is interesting. it makes yu laugh gasp and even question your inner goddess to try new things. but the book keeps going makes you want more.you wont want to put it down
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really loved it. Kept me interested the whole time!! Would recommend to anyone who enjoys sci-fi and survival stories.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a very challenging, yet relaxing game. It is a great strategy game that you can take all the time you need!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I love the ease of using it. Just being able to write something on the fly or record a thought or picture makes it worth having. I use it for journaling and making lists.
B006TJXZ30|5.0|It makes it so easy to read my emails on the go.  I don't have to wait to get home.
B000VMBXNA|5.0|I love Alan Bennett's humor.  It keeps the story alive.  I just wished it had been a longer book to savor.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|It just as good as if I was on my laptop at home. Can look for stuff right on the spot.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|this is definitenley not a show for anyone sensitive,this seasons storyline has been a bit more dark and intense a very edge of your seat type of season.It didnt dissapoint in any way which was s somthing i was afraid of after how good season one turned out to be,but this picked right up with that level of intensity,and a storyline leaving you not just wanting,but needing to know what happend next. A must reccomend for AHS fans. Id also reccomend this to anyone who enjoyed the Kingdom Hospital series
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I  love the dictionary definitions I love this book the dictionary so much more than a reading books it is so  good for us
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|As a fan of Tim Burton I knew this was going to be a great movie,I had seen the original as a child and Im quite familar with the story of doctor frankenstien and this did it with an interesting spin. I most related to victor and sparky being a dog owner myself,but i really enjoyed the other characters as well. the movie was great for kids and kids at heart alike.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice calculator, nice display and works great on my new Kindle Fire HD. Also it is very easy to use.
B0075MFS9Y|4.0|This is a very good selection of original songs by a grest young band. I would call the music &#34;American&#34; in the tradition going back to The Band.  Just good folk/rock/coumtry ballads and rockers.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Landy does a wonderful job presenting a book about familial relationships under the guise of a legal thriller. His courtroom detail makes you think a little of Grisham, but his stark characterization shows that this book is far deeper than prosecutors and defendants. A great read.
B008FRJ1IW|2.0|I was very disappointed in this product. I can't believe Lego charges so much for this very little bag. I will not be buying anymore Lego's.
030758836X|3.0|The book really kept my interest and became hard to put down.  The plot twisted and turned and kept you wondering what was going to happen next.  I was really enjoying the book until the end.  The ending left me frustrated and annoyed and spoiled the whole story for me.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I read this book in a few hours and I was very disappointed that I couldn't immediately get my hands on the second book! It was an excellent adventure. I'm in love with the characters, both the good and the bad. Morgan Rice did a great job of creating a unique world to dive into. One of the best things I like about her writing, is everyone from my mother, to myself, to my children can read her books. I've read other books of hers and am equally impressed. She has become one of my favorite authors. I highly recommend reading this and her other books.
B005LAIIQC|3.0|We start off technically where we left off.  And for those of US that have not left off.  There are plenty of flashbacks to catch us up where we left off.<br /><br />Jason Bourne is still on the loose; he gets a cameo picture in this movie.  Our new hero for this film is the estranged operative Aron Cross (Jeremy Renner) who comes in from the cold to find he was scheduled for dispatch. Only he has no intention of coming in quietly. He is assisted and assists the beautiful Dr. Marta Shearing (Rachel Weisz) as they race for a cure and escape from the evil U.S. government cabal of know-it-alls.<br /><br />Lots of blood and guts and cheesy scenes, beautiful women, big guns, wide country, and no definitive ending.<br /><br />Okay now we are ready for the next movie.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Easy and simple but good for killing time.<br />However, lack of game info makes game delayed<br />I would recommend to my friends this free apps
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Very entertaining.  The whole family loved it.  The music was awesome; it had lots of funny scenes.  Good and fun movie with some good messages.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I really like this! Story line good. Graphics great but could have used more hidden objects, but that's just me. I am addicted.  Loved the monkey!!!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Words can't express how much I enjoyed this movie.<br /><br />My only complaint would be the lack of black widow's abilities. We see a glimpse of her great fighting abilities in the beginning but then we are left with her using tiny little pistols that scream 'uselessness'.<br /><br />Oh well, everything else was amazing. Hilarious, action-packed, great graphics, good packaging. A++
B00AQ4U6P4|3.0|(Warning: contains some spoilers)  Take a little Psycho, a little Sleepaway Camp, a little Halloween, and you have a lot of this movie.  For those familiar with the horror genre, the first 20 minutes pretty much let you know how the story is going to end.  I will say that the first half of the movie does a good job of creating a creepy, unsettling feeling (thanks to the camera work), but at about the one hour mark, things considerably lose steam...I couldn't believe that there were 40 minutes left.  One of the issues is that in most movies where there's a \\"big reveal\\" it's saved for the very end.  This movie gradually lets the viewer in on the mystery in a way that kills whatever suspense was established during those very decent first 60 minutes.  I'm purposely being vague because I don't want to give too much away, but the fact is there aren't many directions for the bare bones storyline to take.  Mother and teenage daughter are looking to start a new life...move into a new house...patricide occurred in the house next door...body of murderer never found...brother of murderer/son of murdered still living in the same creepy house in which his parents were killed...teenage daughgter falls for this ostracized, sensitive young man who is keeping a secret from her which the audience is let in on.  This is all laid out in about the first half hour.  There are some twists, but as I said they occur well before the movie ends.  Another problem, in terms of creating an excess of mystery, is that the movie involves very few characters: Jennifer Lawrence as the teenage daughter, Elisabeth Shue as her mother, and Max Thierot as Ryan the troubled boy next door share probably 90% of the total dialogue and camera time.  A good horror movie is hard to find lately and this isn't a bad one; it's just not a very original one.  There's even a friendly, small-town stock police character so brilliantly satirized in Scream.  Maybe all of the good ideas have been taken.  The movie was clearly made for a teenage audience and if you haven't seen many other horror movies, you may feel it holds more suspense than I did. There's no getting around how basic the storyline is, but considering that, the acting is good and particularly during the first half of the film there are some unnerving shots (not really any gore...definitely PG-13).
0800141660|5.0|Ah, I loved this one. I love the constant tug of emotions between characters, I love how well they are portrayed. Bravo. Everything worked well, no complaints.
B00A5052YE|4.0|Alicia has done it again, making great mature music. She is very talented and its shown through her constant great music.
B0034G4P80|5.0|I really liked this movie, it was another win for their heroes series. Good combination action, graphics, humor and a touch of romance. Well done!
B001ZG4J00|5.0|I love this artist. I wish that there was new material, but the sound and production quality of this album is a vast improvement on the other currently available cd's
B004SIP7AS|5.0|I really liked this, and will definitely be watching it over and over. Even my Dad enjoyed it. A tale of seeing what's right in front of us when we're too busy looking everywhere else. Gwen plays her character very well, too well sometimes you just want to shake some sense into her.<br /><br />:-D
B009R89HY6|5.0|I really love this book! I haven't yet the chance to reading the other books but I'll have soon I hope!
B005LAIHZY|3.0|Maybe I should blame the hype, but I was super excited to watch this and as such had very high expectations. It was completely different than what I was imagining. The humor was not my cup of tea and I not sure I liked the overall message. Graphics were gorgeous, and the ending was really nice. Love the triplet brothers, very likeable.<br /><br />Maybe watch before you buy.
B00787IR2Q|1.0|The movie is a great movie as I saw it when it first came out, but playing it for my kids through Amazon was horrible. I started and restarted more than I got to watch it.

B000ECX0QU|3.0|For a description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some thoughts on this movie...<br /><br />Topaz (1969) is an Alfred Hitchcock Cold War spy thriller.  Hitchcock was in a slump in the mid to late 1960s starting with Torn Curtain (1966), and later Topaz.  Topaz, while not a bad movie, is problematic for me for several reasons.  One is that it's too long.  I believe it's Hitch's longest film ever.  For a movie that's already dull, dry, stale, and bland, this is borderline torture.  Secondly, I find that I can't really connect with the characters very much.  They're just sort of on the screen doing their thing and they're not exactly likeable.  Third, the acting is wooden for the most part.  Fourth, the movie lacks the typical &#34;Hitchcock feel&#34; of his previous movies.  I think Hitchcock briefly lost his touch during the second half of the 1960s.  Maybe it's because of his choice of stories and plots - that is, making Cold War spy thrillers.  There are a some good moments in Topaz, but they're not great in number.  Lastly, the dialogue is too lengthy throughout much of the movie, adding to the dullness.<br /><br />On the plus side, this movie does have some nice looking women in it.  I added a star because of this.  The sets are pretty good, also.<br /><br />I really don't think this movie should be labeled an &#34;Alfred Hitchcock Masterpiece&#34;.  It's far from it.  I do think that every Hitchcock fan should view it and judge for themselves.  This might be one of those movies that might grow on you over time the more times you watch it - an acquired taste.  I give it 3 stars because it does have some memorable moments and is well filmed.<br /><br />The extras on the DVD include a segment called &#34;Topaz: An Appreciation&#34; by film historian and critic Leonard Maltin.  Maltin does a good job describing why this movie has been unfairly criticized while also making a good case for its re-evaluation decades later.  He also does a good job sticking up for Hitchcock and gives many interesting viewpoints with historical perspective.  Watch and see for yourself.ting viewpoints with historical perspective.

B0084AZXKK|5.0|Before Capt. Jack Sparrow there was Long John Silver.  If you love adventure stories with pirates and buried treasure you will love this book. RLS provides a riveting tale told from the perspective of a young boy. I had never read anything from Stevenson before, but from the start of this book I was hooked.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Very informative - very high quality - I couldn't believe how we as Americans are being so hornswogled and bambulzed
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Harry Bosch! With all his foibles and neurosis he is a great detective. Connelly's writing never fails and the stories are not predictable. I like that I never can figure out the plot in the first chapter and can't turn the pages fast enough. I already look forward to the next one.
030758836X|5.0|I bought the book as a Christmas gift, so have not read it.  I did receive it promptly and in great condition.
B006ZJJ70O|5.0|I thank \\"discophage\\" for taking us through the contents of the package.  I have both this one and the Columbia Stereo Recordings set.  I find this one to be the more interesting of the two.  I bought the Columbia principally for the Ives which was one of Stokey's premieres both in performance and recording.  Both sets remind us that he premiered many 20th century works during his career in America.  But the current (RCA) set has more of what brings me to Stokowski in the first place -- principally Romantic-period works, 20th century works, AND, dare I say, his way with the baroque -- which, yes, I know is not baroque at all but shows us insights that are purely musical rather than historic, scholastic, or pedantic.<br /><br />Stokowski was accused of wrapping Back in the \\"purple robes of Wagner\\" and the same might be said of his approach to Handel -- but the sounds are gorgeous.  My principal Water Music is that of MacKerras and the Orchestra of St. Lukes, but Stokowski's is an alternative because it sounds so remarkably different.<br /><br />I do like Stokowski/Wagner as well because he does the lush sound of Wagner soooo well.  He did not conduct Wagner in the opera house, but the Pearl releases of his Wagner during the Philadelphia period show us that he was introducing \\"bleeding chunks\\" of Wagner to a broad audience in America (through radio and recordings) that brought WWII era Americans to Wagner.  I swear that I had pre-natal knowledge of Tristan because my father played Stokowski's recordings during my gestation.  Stokowski's ca. 1960 recording of Wagner (included in this set) was a New York Times \\"10 best of the year\\" I believe.  One reason for this is because of the wonderful \\"sound\\" of the recording.<br /><br />Stokowski was always interested in the technical side of recording.  His friendship with Dr. Harvey Fletcher at Bell Labs pioneered stereo recording and led not only to Disney's Fantasia but the entire validation of stereophonic recording which found its way into Cinemascope movies (beginning 1953) and eventually to consumer stereo in 1958.  Dolby Surround of today is the successor to these early stereo experiments -- the one could not even exist without the invention of the other.  Stokowski is one of the reasons we have all that, now.<br /><br />So Stokowski recordings are almost always a treat because he \\"interfered\\" in the control room.  He had not only the sound the live orchestra in his ear but also the sound of the final recording.  What his musical scholarship may have lacked (in the baroque) was certainly made up for in his knowledge of the science of recording which he understood better than almost any other conductor.  He also had an ear tuned to the audience itself.  His arrangement of the orchestral-seating was a direct result of his discussions with Fletcher about human hearing.  He realized that what may sound good on the podium does not sound as well balanced from the audience perspective.  This was based on sound scientific research of Dr. Fletcher.  Stokowski incorporated those acoustic discoveries musically.  It was not about musical scholarship -- it was about what sounded best and most musically balanced from the audience perspective.  That has all been lost, now, because conductors really never understood why it was done in the first place.  Stokowski understood.<br /><br />All of that interest in the final sound ends up in his recordings.  Of those recordings, these RCA stereo recordings are wonderful examples.  They show an integration of the recording art with music that is really rarely accomplished or understood.<br /><br />These are better \\"recordings\\" than either the EMI or the Columbia set. They bring back wonderful memories of some vinyl I owned back in the day and introduce me to some things I have never owned.  Stokowski was a matchless re-creative and technically aware conductor -- almost one of a kind in the whole history of conducting.nd its way into Cinemascope movies (beginning 1953) and eventually to consumer stereo in 1958.

B006S009IY|5.0|This is a story of how the Peter Pan play came about, great for kids to see that it was designed as a play. Also, to show how one's imagination can change the world, despite living in a world of critics even in the early 1900's.
B0058DRUV6|1.0|Personally, I think this is a horrible book. The companies he picks are terrible and his only focus is on financial return to stockholders, nothing about how the companies are when it comes to corporate responsibility. Even that being said, many of the companies he picks have ended up not doing so well or have even gone out of business. If you think the only thing that makes a company good is its ability to provide a high stock price for its investors, even if only for a short period of time, then you might enjoy this book. However; if you think a company has a responsibility to be a good citizen in the communities they do business and have an obligation to treat their employees and customers with respect then you will probably think this book is trash as I did.

B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book.  It was both amazing and disturbing at the same time.  As a parent you can't imagine your child hurting another child, but killing one is a whole other level.  What a family does to protect their child goes way above and beyond in this chilling book.  Once you think you know the ending - Surprise!<br />This book was so addictive I couldn't put it down.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone, especially parents who think they know their children.
B007712XAU|5.0|This is a fantastic show.  My daughter told me about it and I fell in love with the first episode.  I read other reviews about other versions being choppy and pieced together.  I didn't see any of that with these DVD'S.  Flawless viewing and excellent quality.
0525953728|2.0|There is quite a bit of fill in the book, but it is a decent read.  Given the topic this was destined to be a best seller regardless of who wrote it.  That is sort of the problem, who wrote it?  With ghost writers and protecting themselves from giving up top secret information (minus the pictures which seem to do that in spades), it is hard to tell exactly how real this book was for me.  I know we are protecting identities, but it fell flat in that regard.

B004L3AQFG|4.0|Based on actual events, 127 Hours (2010) is about an outdoor enthusiast who gets trapped in a freak accident, and has to make a terrible decision in order to save his life.  If you don't want more revealed, stop here, as some spoilers follow.<br /><br />Academy Award winning director Danny Boyle (Trainspotting, [[ASIN:B000VDDWEC 28 Days Later]], [[ASIN:B001P9KR94 Slumdog Millionaire]]) is a man whose films encompass many genres.  Boyle helped co-write the screenplay for 127 Hours, which is based on a book by Aron Ralston, a hiker who ran into trouble while on an extended hike in 2003.  James Franco ([[ASIN:B007L4HFDI Spider-Man]]), plays Ralston, a young man in top physical condition, who is an avid biker and hiker.  While in Utah's Blue John Canyon, Ralston slips and falls into a crack in a rock formation.  His right arm gets wedged in between the rocks, and is pinned in place by another rock that has fallen down into the crack.  The hiker is unable to free himself, and has few supplies and tools.<br /><br />At the remote location, the prospects for rescue are slim, as no one knows where he is.  During the many days that he is trapped, Ralston reflects on his life, regrets, and also dreams about being free.  After many days, it appears that his right arm is beyond saving.  Finally, in desperation, Ralston uses a small knife to sever his arm, and emerge from the crack.<br /><br />Featuring some breathtaking locations, 127 Hours gives you a real feel for the natural environment, which has been shaped by erosion over the eons.  A brief interlude with two female hikers, reveals the presence of water trapped within the rocks.  After experiencing complete freedom, and the expansiveness of nature, it is a bit of a shock, when the focus suddenly narrows to Ralston trapped on a small ledge, with just a sliver of the sky visible above.<br /><br />James Franco's performance is quite powerful, holding your interest, despite not being able to move around much, as the film explores what happens inside Ralston's head.  Boyle's direction is creative and mostly effective.  Things do build up to Ralston's very grim decision, which may have you gritting your teeth, and averting your eyes, does not play out as graphically as it could have.<br /><br />Powerful, and something of an educational experience, 127 Hours is effective, but perhaps not a film that you will want to revisit on a regular basis.  Displaying talent in a variety of projects, Danny Boyle remains one of the more impressive and interesting directors around.res what happens inside Ralston's head.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really, really, REALLY did not want to like this series. I usually read classic literature and am very vocal about my distaste for other books. I am, by no means, a teenage girl, and was quite embarrassed to even be picking out the book. However, I had seen so much hype surrounding these, that my curiosity was provoked and I gave in. I gave in for about a week. That's all it took me to finish all three books, and this was during the holidays when people wouldn't leave me alone. Otherwise, they would have been done in three days. The plot is akin to something George Orwell would have cooked up, with politics, action, fantasy, romance, all centered in a dystopian society. It's not difficult to see historical inspiration in this either. The Roman coliseum, segregation into working camps, propaganda and mass intimidation, not dissimilar to Communist Russia. But even if you don't care for all that, this is a story about very believable characters with very real motivations. At least worth a try.
B0049P1VHS|4.0|AMC's The Walking Dead, based on the graphic novels by Robert Kirkman, Tony Moore, and Charlie Adlard, convincingly captured the imagination of the public in its inaugural season.  The degree of success of a series about a world where the undead prey on the living, probably came as a major surprise to some, as in recent years, there has been no shortage of \\"zombie\\" or \\"outbreak\\" films, such as [[ASIN:B000VDDWEC 28 Days Later]] (2002), and it's radical sequel, [[ASIN:B000VDDWEM 28 Weeks Later]] (2007).<br /><br />There are many reasons why The Walking Dead achieved such popularity, starting with the high quality of the source material.  With the graphic novels sometimes serving as storyboards, the goal of the series' creative team, which includes Frank Darabont ([[ASIN:B003ZHR6RK The Shawshank Redemption]], [[ASIN:B001AR0D4A The Mist]]) and Gale Anne Hurd (The Terminator films), was to bring a fictional world to life.  Characterized by high production values, The Walking Dead features stunning visuals, creative camerawork, and top drawer special effects, with contributions from genre effects wizard, Greg Nicotero ([[ASIN:B001ECDVZE Sin City]], Planet Terror, [[ASIN:B0040YFR1Y Predators]]).<br /><br />It's quite remarkable, that a program which routinely features brutal gore and graphic violence worthy of a hard R rating, would be produced on a cable network like AMC.  The apparent lack of censor ship is amazing, as series does not shy away from showing zombies hacked to pieces, or splattered apart.<br /><br />Set in Georgia, the story follows the aftermath of a viral outbreak that turns victims into mindless flesheaters, that behave much like George Romero's traditional zombies.  The story begins with Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) a law enforcement officer who is in the hospital when the outbreak occurs.  Upon waking from a coma, Grimes finds himself in a strange and terrible world where death is all around.<br /><br />Frank Darabont does a fine job of directing, and the series contains some memorable visuals, such as Grimes entering Atlanta on a horse, and encountering zombies on the street.  While suspenseful and at times shockingly brutal, The Walking Dead is by no means perfect.  Leaving the town where he lives, Grimes wisely gathers a cache of weapons, but seems to neglect to take food and other basic supplies.  Headed for Atlanta in a truck, he runs out of gas.  While clearly not the most well-prepared guy, Grimes is truly blessed, as with help from a group of survivors, he escapes from the undead who have him trapped in an army tank, and then is miraculously reunited with his missing wife and son.<br /><br />While much that occurs is based on the graphic novels, the season finale, an expedition to the Center for Disease Control (CDC) in Atlanta, is an exception.  While this adventure seems to suffer from plot conveniences and timing issues, some key background information is provided, and the stage is set for \\"life on the road\\" in Season Two.<br /><br />Much like a series like 24, being able to watch the episodes consecutively makes for a terrific viewing experience, where you can really become immersed into the world of The Walking Dead, at whatever pace you choose.  Some situations are ridiculous, or don't ring true, but the nature of this savage world is fairly consistent, with the high quality special effects contributing to the realism.  With a strong action component, character development occasionally suffers, but these are people that you can generally get behind and care about.<br /><br />The BBC's TV Series [[ASIN:B0038MUZCK Survivors]] (1975), and the [[ASIN:B0038MUZCA 2008 remake]] of the same name, also explored post-apocalyptic worlds for an extended period of time.  There are some common elements with The Walking Dead, however no previous program had achieved the phenomenal success of AMC's production, which is entering its fourth season.  The zombie genre remains popular, and with good quality films in rather short supply, a series like The Walking Dead is very much appreciated.  It has issues, and may not be as original as some believe, but for a cable TV program, it offers much to fans who have grown weary of poor quality movies featuring the undead.her short supply, a series like The Walking Dead is very much appreciated.

0920668372|2.0|Before we kick off this review, let me just state that this is a beautiful premise for a children's book. It is one of those ideas so lovely it makes you wish that you could write something as heartwarming. However, this is just a warning.<br /><br />Now that I am older, I can appreciate the beauty and warmth of this picture book. I heard of it a few years ago, and found it absolutely gorgeous. However, if I had read it as a small child--the audience for which the story is intended--this would have terrified me.<br /><br />As another reviewer commented, I was horrified of death one day. Albeit my parents told me that there was a Heaven, I was not certain about that and lived in fear of being rendered motionless underground in total boredom and sadness for all eternity without ever seeing my friends, family, or favorite things and people again. I was also petrified of the prospect of having my parents die one day, as that same reviewer mentioned. I once had a nightmare as a preschooler that my mother would die if I did not stop crying. Many people complain that the primary negative factor of this story is that it promotes obsessive tendencies, like climbing a ladder into your grown son's bedroom at night to sing him a lullaby. That is not my complaint, and personally I feel that people who do complain about it either have dirty minds or are simply looking for something to complain about. It is a CHILDREN'S BOOK. What's next, are people going to start complaining that Jack and the Beanstalk encourages children that, not only is it all right to steal, but it is okay to trade something that could be used to purchase necessities in life for something seemingly stupid and worthless, because everything will be all right in the end? Please. However, something as heartfelt as this could have easily triggered my anxieties and sent me bursting into tears as a child. So, if you intend upon giving this to children, I would recommend buying it for them only if you are absolutelyPOSITIVE that it would not make them fear death so much, or that the part involving the death of the man's elderly mother wouldn't set off anxieties. Or, it could make a nice present for an older person, because it is really a lovely storybook--you just need to beware of the kind of children you're giving it to.

B008XNZMOU|5.0|It is great to see a young artist not afraid to sing about the plights of the young. Though she may be ridiculed for it, I say let her sing. Who else listens to teenagers about love than other teenagers. Maybe they can learn a thing or two and thus avoid a mistake or two.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is awesome, its great for kids and adults alike. It has dragons, dragons, and more dragons, it is great.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I thought this book was very well written.  It took about 70 pages to start getting into it which I was warned abut prior.  The ending just left you hanging and that is what I feel ruined the entire book,  It ended too abruptly with no closure whatsoever
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I  wasn't familiar with Lambert prior to picking up this CD. I had seen it rated as one of the top 10 CDs of 2012. There is only one song on it I don't care for. Tracks #4 and #10 are particularly good. Good beat and good voice.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I kept hearing that season 2 was no where near as good as 1, it is completely different and just as twisted, we are only a few episodes into it but so far it is keeping us wanting more
B009IRVSVQ|4.0|I saw him perform, and became interested in his music. Its a party CD, good beat , a little explicit in places.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I enjoyef this book extremely!  It was hard for me to set the book down, as I was continuously wanting more and excited to see what was instore for the characters of The Night circus.  Celia Bowen was my favorite character.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I gave as a gift and they haven't mentioned they saw the films, but I think for the price, it was well worth it.
B002LFAHBO|5.0|Love this movie and had it on dvd. The only difference between the original dvd and the bluray is that the Kelly Clarkson Song (The trouble with love) is absent and another song is in its place. This is during the christmas party dance scene at the art gallery. Kinda weird, but still great movie.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I just saw the new movie &#34;Les Miserables&#34; and wanted more background.  The book is interesting and a good piece of history.
B00A77II0U|3.0|There were aspects of Stray Souls that I enjoyed.  The graphics are well done, and the storyline is interesting.  The item hunts are challenging as well.  The same cannot be said for the 'puzzles', the majority of which are simply running around collecting pieces.  I ended up using the map functionality a lot in Expert mode to tell me where to go to avoid having to hunt screen by screen for every next step.<br /><br />Other games also involve a lot of hunting, but this one was frustrating because the load time for any screen switch was noticeable on my Samsung Galaxy Note 10.1.  There was a great deal of lag on any action.  Longest of all were the cut scene transitions.<br /><br />After the game is completed, there is a bonus chapter.  Completing this unlocks additional production materials.  I enjoyed the bonus, as it provided more backstory.  That completed, I could see no replay value.  Online walkthroughs indicate there is no reward/unlock for collecting all the 'Beyond' items.
B0050KEVO6|4.0|It's more of an ongoing, progressive activity than a &#34;game.&#34; It helps exercise your logic (some combinations make sense), humor (some combinations are clever/funny), memory (retracing steps to recreate things you made, etc), and knowledge (when connected to the Internet, you can easily see scientific facts about any item by dragging it to the question mark area). Play it a few minutes at a time, and you can savor this game for months/years.<br /><br />Although the ultimate goal is to create every possible thing that the game allows, I believe the true joy in a game like this is each and every new item you discover. You get a special vibration when you make something new for the first time, and to me, that's where the fun is. (The discover, not the vibration. XD)<br /><br />This might also be a good game to play with kids, as it's kinda educational. Surely some creations are absurd/silly, but it's the thought that counts. You can ask your child &#34;Why do you think this and this create this?&#34; to test their intelligence.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Like the author's other book, \\"Gone Girl,\\" it's such a twisted nightmare, but makes completely perfect sense... I'd recommend for a quick read!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|So happy this story turned out the way it did. A happy ending never gets old. A lot of meaning comes from these books.
B002EEP3NO|4.0|I already had the SSD, so when this was on sale, it didn't take much for me to pull the trigger.  I don't think much of a review is needed, you pretty much know what your'e in for.  About 6-10 hours of construction, to build one of the top 2 Lego Star Wars models out there.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Loved this series. This book was a great ending to the entire trilogy. I'm glad the author made it more of a story.
0740748475|5.0|Man, i love AWD.  Got this for a great price in 'Very Good' condition.  The entire package came sealed and in pristine condition.  Personally i have no idea how Amazon can even ship this item for the price i paid, but I'm ecstatic to benefit from it.  Been stalking this product for years, as Calvin & Hobbes was such a part of my youth.  I really look forward to sharing this with my kids.
B00008QSA5|5.0|This is an eye opener to Al Kooper's early production efforts. I have his latest studio recordings and just plain love them. This is basic good music, the kind you don't hear on the radio anymore.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|I don't think the box does this thing justice.  It is absolutely massive.  I threw it in my office to see people's reaction to it and almost everyone has a comment.  It's Lego, It's Star Wars and it's really expensive.  Not much else to it.
B00005K9QP|5.0|The music is fantastic. Clapton's playing is out front and on the edge. His energy and excitement with the songs makes me want to listen to this recording over and over again. This is the kind of music that NEVER gets old. British blues royalty.
B005LAII3A|4.0|So very much better then Arnold's Total Recall movie. This is a high tech fast paced machine of a movie.
B00008O31I|5.0|I received the record on time. Packaging was durable for shipment. The Black Key Rock so hard! Simply Amazing. If you are taking the time to read this just buy it already
B00A2IUHM6|5.0|This movie is hilarious!! At first I thought it would be kind of stupid but no this is a comedy and a drama (at the end) to go along to make an awesome movie that keep me laughing over and over .
B00006J9OT|5.0|The BEST of Diana. I have 2. My friend in Australia says it best...&#34;She sang directly to ME in this one&#34;  She raised the bar high and flew over it.
B009MO57H6|5.0|I love this Resident Evil. Like the rest it goes way beyond the boundries!! It is fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B008FSCNTK|1.0|I think we have near all of Diana and recently enjoyed her in person. This one had it's problems, especially in recording.  Sorry Diana.  We expected more.
B002DQFHKM|5.0|The best Metal soundtrack to any movie!! This has tons of big name bands and artist in it. A must to have if you grew up in the 80s.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I've always enjoyed logic puzzles and this one is great! I love that there are so many included. Highly recommend.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|WOW. Just finished this read and I am more motivated then I ever have been to build the body that I want. I have been in the gym now for about 4 years. Those four years have been filled with frustration, wrong exercises, little muscle gain and multiple instances where I want to give up. After reading BLS I am determined and motivated to rework my eating and workouts. I know exactly what to eat and when. I know exactly what lifts to do and the correct form. I know exactly what supplements to take. Every tool, tip, myth, and advice to being successful on my body is in this book. Highly Highly recommend this to anybody who is looking to build or cut the right way!
B0090YHSFC|5.0|I have to say that I really enjoy this one. It's cute, but not too brainy. The patience comes in because you have to wait for the critters to go where you want so you can slice the ice! The puzzle part is trying to maneuver making the slices for the fewest slices you can. Moderate-high recommendation.
0471463396|5.0|This book is very good for beginners in investment, especially franchise evaluation.<br />The first part is very good descriptive in liquidation value and reproduction value.<br />Also other important aspect is EARNINGS POWER VALUE, margin of safety and modern approach to today`s investment.<br /><br />Strongly advice start with this book.<br /><br />Good investing,<br />Alex
B0088WJQ1G|4.0|Glen is a great musician.  He ties his heart into his music and has the uncanny ability to write and sing songs that make you say &#34;Man, I know what that guy was feeling, I've been there...&#34;
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is an excellent game.  It relies heavily on your creativity.  The only limit is the number of levels and your creativity.  Game makers, I give you ten stars**********!  Just get to work on some more levels, please.
B004SUWR2C|2.0|The game is kind of fun but often freezes. Also if you don't respond quickly enough the app tells you what to do.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This app is excellent for anyone wanting something with very brief games. You start with just a few (about 10), and you earn points that you use to &quot;buy &quot; more. That also doesn't take long. There is a huge variety of game types, and some can be a bit challenging, but they are quick to complete. The longest one I have played so far took about 15 minutes to win,  but it was a version of sudoku,  and that naturally takes a while to play. Many take less than one minute. So far,  I have seen no card games,  although I am only about 20 games into it. Defititely not bad for a free download and a nice change from standard gaming.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I couldn't stop watching it. I loved the characters, history, splendor and the story is captivating. I hope it never ends!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The Hunger Games was a great book. I rarely find a book that keeps me interested, but this one food.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a wonderful game. The graphics are top notch, the levels are challenging but not impossible. If you have kids this one is a fun game with no blood and guts or violence. Just as with where`s my water I highly recommend this one for kids and adults alike.
1419705849|5.0|My son usually complains about having to read but he reads all of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid books as soon as they are published.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Good read.  It shows that everyone v has someone special if they don't look too hard for it.  It's usually there all along.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This is definitely my favorite Halo book. If you were going to read just one, pick this one! If you played the game first, don't expect it to match up exactly, but it fits the book universe perfectly.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Writen is such a way I felt I was with them, Great book. I would recommend this book for any one that might have any thought in going into the Navy
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Just started this game. It has a very good story line. So far I am enjoying it! The graphics are great! Playing it on kindle fire hd with no problems.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My son is six and loves it!  I love it too,  because it keeps him quiet; although, he interrupts me to see the cool stuff. I kind of want the skater to get caught! Spray painting sub-way cars is not cool.
B001NAT05W|3.0|Cute and sassy. But it's cheaply made and tears up easily. The plastic ears are not that cute. But my little girl like it
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|the more you level up the more coins you get I have over 4 thousand. don't sell your prizes keep all the whistle.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I really enjoy mastering every level of the game. Addictive in a good way! Fun, plain and simple. No bells or whistles needed.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Although I'm an older (much older) youngster I enjoy young adult or youth books for their clean language and fewer immoral activities (I think you can follow that).<br />I was perusing B&N.com for a fantasy novel and saw a recommendation for A Quest of Heros.  I read some reviews and it sounded good so I ordered it.  I only have one complaint...the book ended to quick.  The read was enjoyable and I didn't want it to end.  I saw similarities to other books I've read but with twists that made the story Morgan's own.  I enjoyed the growth and challenges Thorgrin faced as he moves toward his dream of being a warrior for his King.  Thorgrin has severe problems trying to be accepted by his peers and the King's Knights until he saves the life of a fellow trainee at the risk of his own life.  Conditions start to improve but he has many more challenges to follow for he still has enemies that are determined to destroy him.<br />This is a good read and I am eagerly wailing for book #2.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Loved the movie.  Will watch it again.  Now I now why my daughter raved about it and told me to buy the movie.
1401922732|5.0|I love this deck more than all of them, and I have quite a few from Doreen Virtue....I make sure i clear the cards each time but OMG it is amazingly and surprisingly accurate.  Answers that I dont expect and yet hope for.  I just let him tell me what I need to hear because Im not sure of what question to ask....and it is profound as if we are really having a conversation.  I guess my mind will always doubt that there is a real connection made and yet I am truly amazed at the answers i get.  I recommend these to anyone and from my experience please do clear the cards each time..I think it makes a difference...SG
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Most Pixar films are a big hit in our household.  This one is no exception.  I like it because it has a lot of character and there aren't any overly scary parts that I have to worry about fast-forwarding through.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I have recently started reading Nicholas Sparks books. They are fantastic books. Full of excitement and emotion. His writing is so descriptive that I can picture where the characters are and what's going on around them. This book definitely had a twist in end.
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I have been trying so hard to get through this book since I have already paid for it but the writing is hard to follow, and its simply boring.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is definitely one of those books you cant put down. Many twists and turns keeps you wanting to read more.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this is a very fun game. it sure helps pass the time. easy to play and understand. I would get it again .
B007J4T2G8|5.0|excellent book. highly recommended.i can't put it down. i ordered the second one.i probably go to thr trilogy. thank you.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Taking youtube everywhere with my kindle is great.  Love storing my favorite videos right on my kindle!  I would tell my friends about it.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|The book was fine. It had really good parts in it. Then others were really boring. I wanted more from this book.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love being able to check out my pinterest on my Kindle Fire.  This is a great app that I would recommend to any pinterest user.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Phenomenal in<br /> every aspect. D  Dr  Dr e s w s w s s s s s s w w
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Im so glad I finally purchased the third book of the trilogy.  The day I bought it I read 87% of it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It's been a Long  time since a book  has gotten me emotional even though the events  in this book isn't real the  details ? an  you feel they can be a possibility
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I am addicted to this game!  Its just to cute and it was free.  I have been telling all my friends that they need to download this game!
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This game is so awesome! You get to create your vehicle and stuff. I discovered  that you can make and run multiple vehicles in one run in sandbox mode. It's so fun to run little vehicles and see witch one is the best! I wonder if they will make an option to so you can race against other people live. I don't know why people are complaining about the ad's that pop up every once in a while, just ignore them. It's worth it, I promise!
B001ZG4J00|5.0|Rodriguez second album &#34;Coming From Reality&#34; is as relevant today and it was when recorded in the 60's.<br />It's straight forward lyrics are understandable, poignant and easier to decipher than Bob Dylan.<br />In this album there are moments with a hint of James Taylor in his voice.<br />I can't wait to see the documentary &#34;Searching for Sugar Man&#34; which was just nominated for an academy award:<br />Sometimes justice comes late in life.<br />John Bork
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Good but not as interesting as I thought and it got really boring when I got twenty pages into it
055357342X|5.0|Like all of George R.R. Martin's books in the A Song of Ice and Fire series,  A Storm of Swords is full of complex plots, interesting and mostly believable characters, chnaging situations and shifting fortunes.  This book is packed with action, and it is difficult to put it down, until the finish.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|Overall I like this app, but you need to get the full version to be able to wake up to music. Oh. The device has to stay on in order for the alarm to work. This also drains your battery, and your not supposed to keep a device charging for too long. It messes with future battery life. Like I said it does the job but it's not what I expected.
B009ERK1T0|5.0|As usual.  The Deftones deliver another masterpiece.  Diamond Eyes was a fantastic album reminding more of their earlier releases.  Koi No Yokan appears to have a mixture of both their older style, as well as tasteful inclusion of experimentation.  You need to buy this album.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|best book ever, good cliffhanger I wish there was no cliffhanger but it is okay this is a good book
B007US9NA8|5.0|Just go see for yourself at any bookstore, this book has EVERYTHING for someone who wants to improve their workout habits and routine. The book is highly motivational as I read it almost daily. Buy the Ebook, it's cheaper and not as heavy as a real encyclopedia.
B0097C8XL0|3.0|this app is ok but it could be a little bit better and can really use an update but overall it vBulletin is ok.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|My first read from this author. Very good one too. Already downloaded the second book in the JR series and can't stop reading.
B00AP9RQE4|5.0|I'm thrilled to note that Ivan finally has a book of his own, in which he gets to do something besides get mixed up in Miles's adventures and look silly therein. He gets his chance to be the man, this time--for a beautiful reward. Adventure, humor, all the good things you have come to expect from the Vorkosigan Saga are present in this story. It's sheer good fun and you will be rooting for Ivan all the way through.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Am I the only person that did not think this book was well written?  I bought it to see what the hype was all about and was disappointed on many levels.  An intelligent woman who allows herself to be subjugated this way is not to my liking at all.  I have some concern as to what kind of message this puts out there for young woman.  I will not purchase any other books in this trilogy.
B000NY12LO|5.0|Timely book that really makes one think about the daily torment some students face. As a teacher, this book shook my inner core. Well written, as all Picoult's books are...with that little unexpected twist. Wow!
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Easy to learn, fast-paced, and poses challenges.  This would appeal to just about any age bracket.  Graphics are good, too.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Thought it would be much funnier than it was.  I hate that these reviews require a minimum number of words....
B009WO7NQO|5.0|This is the best version of Angry Birds ever....Graphics are awesome great and fun for any age star wars fan.
1609611543|4.0|Hard to get the recipes together but book is very interesting & has some good ideas to think about. I cut out wheat from my diet & have been slowly dropping weight.
B00A757EFW|5.0|I am a big fan of 80's games (Ex. Tetris, Atari, Pac Man, etc...) and I would definitely recommend this game. Feels like you're at the arcade again, if only it had space invaders as the second choice!
1451662432|5.0|I read this book out of curiosity.  I had no pre-conceived notions of Arnold, but I was intrigued to understand how he became such a success.  I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book and realize that he is a good human being and admittedly not perfect.  He does have many contradictions but also much valuable things to share about his own life journey and how some of the things he has learned and practiced in his life can be applied to drive success in one's career and life.  I would strongly recommend this book to young readers especially those early in their careers as Arnold's philosophical views, experiences, and discipline are the types of things that can turn one's life around if applied properly.  Whether you like the man or not, for whatever reason, I think this book is a winner.
B008XBASVY|5.0|I am always thinking about the future. It is the greatest source of anxiety in my life. Sometimes it makes me want to tear my hair out. If you can relate, you should probably read this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Loved this book had lots of twists and turns in it and was hard to put down.I A must read.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It's  a  Good adventure and  a wonderful book for kids and adults for a long trip and a 3rd grade class
B00A3DZ61W|2.0|It was ok, if it had come out just after the first I would like it better all in all its not bad
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Not a dull moment. Bring on the third. I can't wait to see the exciting live they lead together. The ending scares me leaving me not to know how the we next book will end
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was the most emotional book I have ever read. It was written beautifully and I recommend everyone to read this book.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|I like the game okay but I have a hard time figuring out the mission and the purpose of the journey and it reminds me of Mario Brothers which is well boring at times.
1401216676|5.0|I initially bought this book as a gift for my brother. I was not disappointed. The package arrived quickly, in good condition, and the product itself was treated with care, as I didn't see any bending or tearing of the book itself. Overall, worth the money!
B004SRPXWQ|2.0|I just have nothing good to say about this app except the cat is cute. It is just plain annoying to hear that cat.
1401207529|5.0|I initially bought this book as a gift for my brother. I was not disappointed. The package arrived quickly, in good condition, and the product itself was treated with care, as I didn't see any bending or tearing of the book itself. Overall, worth the money!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The reason I like this game is because it is a challenge and is good for all ages my 4 yr old neice can play it and she loves getting coins for me because I am not a good at the game as she is.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I really wish that I could have a Christian Grey in my life but a girl can dream can't she
B0063GORYU|5.0|Found this game to play faster on my kindle fire, than on my pc.  This has a smooth seamless action  that works better than using a mouse. NOT over crowded with ADs on the free version.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This moving was too cute. I was not sure I was going to like it but after watching it I would watch it again.
B009ZXT4BY|3.0|It is ok but you need more time. I suggest buying the full furtion of it. LoL my name is Emily Noel Kinney:) bye
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book was great, I couldn't seem to put it Down.  I can't wait to start reading the next one
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This was a great game with lots of areas to explore and puzzles to solve. The graphics were amazing for a game at such a low price. I enjoyed every minute of playing it.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|First time ever watching this I was dying of laughter. This movie will never get old. Start to finish you will be laughing the whole time.
0765325950|1.0|Sadly, Tor (perhaps at the request of Robert Jordan's widow) has elected to delay the release of the e-book version of this novel. I have a six bedroom home, and I am out of places to put books. Out of necessity, I use an e-reader. I've been reading these books since shortly after book three came out; it's been a while. For making me wait, I award you one star, and may god have mercy on your soul.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Funny,weird,good,and awesome in one book. So it is a good book for the whole family to enjoy and to share.
1608871452|5.0|Large, beautifully done book with so much behind the scenes info that its a bit overwhelming even for a die-hard fan like myself. I haven't even gotten though half the book so far and every time I pick it up I find out new and interesting things about a show I thought I knew inside out. If you are a fan of Supernatural you must, must, must add this book to your collection.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I read it in one day, because I simply could not put it down. It was such an amazing, wonderful book!
B0076DELIG|3.0|Not one of Connolly's better efforts.  It reads like a bunch of random ideas for for several different books.  Bring back the Lincoln Lawyer.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Thank you E L James for yet another fantastic journey into the world of Christian and Ana.  It's so often these days that lose interest in a book I've been reading they can't seem to hold my interest, but your series I must say I couldn't put down. I always found myself looking for more.  Finally found a series that held  my interest through  all 3 never has that happened before.  Looking forward  to more of your works in the near future !
B005LAIHYU|4.0|Definately a different look at Lincoln and History.  If you like all things vampires, this one is for you.  While based on the book, obviously, to fit on a screen there are some differences and abridgements.
B005LAIIQC|5.0|My husband is a huge fan of the Bourne series and loved this one as well. It arrived very quickly, in perfect condition.
B0057RCFQS|5.0|If you like the Jurassic Park movied, get this video.  We bought this as a Christmas present and I am sure it will be played again and again.
1594744769|4.0|Main lesson learned after reading this book: Stop completely trusting reviews. I almost didn't read this book due to the abundance of negative reviews for it on Goodreads-but it was calling to me, in ways a book rarely calls to me, and I just couldn't ignore it. OH was it worth following my gut-I LOVED this book. Yes, the synopsis is quite deceiving, but I think it is only so for those who were expecting a horror. I tend to stay away from anything that scares me sleepless, so what I found within these pages was right up my alley.<br /><br />The beginning started a little shaky (the tiny hiccup that stopped me from giving 5 stars). I didn't grasp the closeness Jacob apparently felt to his grandfather. Jacob came off as more annoyed and impatient with him, as opposed to being his number 1 fan, which he admits to being later on in the book. I felt like I needed to have that idea instilled in my head right from the start in order to completely immerse myself in the story-his grandfather was the main reason for his actions.<br /><br />However, aside from that, just thinking of this book makes me dizzy with love. I loved the concept, I loved the characters, and I LOVED the magic and intricacy that was the \\"loops\\"-a specific day in time that repeats itself. I loved Ransom Rigg's ability to blend his words into some the most beautiful passages of descriptive scenery:<br /><br />\\"A patchwork of sheep speckled fields spread across hills that rose away to meet a high ridge, where a wall of clouds stood like a cotton parapet. It was dramatic and beautiful, unlike any place I'd seen. I felt a little thrill of adventure as we chugged into the bay, as if I were sighting land where maps had noted only a sweep of undistinguished blue.\\"<br /><br />I even liked the villains, the 'wights' and 'hollowgasts.' I thought they were just scary and intimidating enough. Some reviews pointed out that they should have been more prominent throughout the middle part of the book, but I thought the lack of them there caused enough tension and anticipation to drive the story forward.

B008AX1HD8|3.0|Being a resident of Sydney and having read all the rest of the Harry Hole series, I decided to buy the first which had not been in print.  This was so disappointing as it really gave a very touristy look at Sydney and indeed Sydneysiders.  Nesbo's last books in this series were page turners or tablet tappers, but this one was hard to get enthusiastic about.  However, it did start the development of Harry's personality
B0060AY6FO|4.0|This was a Kindle book. I haven't read it yet. I am very happy with how easy it is to download books on to my Kindle.

B000VNMMQG|5.0|Amazing Grace is indeed amazing. This true story enables<br />everyone to see this shameful part of history and how the<br />perseverance of just a few faithfilled people enabled this<br />practice to be eliminated.  Gave copies to several people<br />with positive comments.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Despite the bad reviews I love this bag. I filled it up.. it holds a lot! I do not sling it over the shoulder go hiking and put it thru it's paces... but use it to transport the gear around and keep it together. It's an excellent bag.
B00AE2KZNQ|5.0|A great itme-period piece that I would encourage all mature audiences to experience. Great acting job by all involved! I bought it to watch whenever the urge strikes, which will surely be often.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was excellent yet very sad. I loved it so much that I cried when peeta was beaten almost to death.
B002RI9ZPY|4.0|The third book continued from the second book, and it was breathtaking.I've wondered  what would happen on Salandar's condition after the attack, her fate, the attackers' fate, and the relationship between Salander and Mikael. But finally all solved. It is sad that the author has passed away after he finished this book, but the odds were all completed in this book and sound suited.
B008745B32|5.0|Talk about superfluous, there is no need to review this classic or Waugh's other classic, the three volume collection published as the \\"Sword of Honor\\" trilogy.  However readers should be aware of a magnificent web site that literally takes you through these books line by line to explain any allusions, Latin and Greek translations, common slang popular in his day, etc.  All this in an easy format to reference the works.  Mr. David Cliffe is so precise, and exacting that he allows you to choose the English edition or the American edition when referencing a particular work.  This site is truly unique and can be found as follows:  [...]    This will enhance your appreciation of these works.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|I was looking forward to read. I tried the movie first and liked it very much. These three kids are all super smart. I can't wait to try the next book and see what would happen in the end. Also, I wish they make the movie's sequel.

B007IXWKUK|1.0|Well I found the smut I was looking for but other than the book really has no depth. Lousy characters, weak story, and teenage level writing skills from an author who just knows her way around a thesaurus.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I liked this book. I would recommend it. I did not except the ending, a total shock. The book is a good read.
B005LAII8K|2.0|It's very subjective, the business of liking/not liking a movie.  To me, this movie was a letdown.  Violent (I'm ok with violence done well), and not at all original even with time travel being the main theme.  A kid with mutant powers, ego's (lots of them), crazies, &#34;the man&#34;, etc., etc.  A confusing mess of a movie.

B003JTHXOK|3.0|Quick read. Developed characters.  Storyline is predictable.  Good for an enjoyable afternoon reading in the sun for nothing but pleasure.
B005LAII1C|5.0|Amazing unrated version. We laughed even more than the movie theatre. We got to see all the alternate scenes, and we love it!
1451695195|3.0|I bought this book with great anticipation and it didn't disappoint, but I got bogged down in reading all the technical jargon.  I'm sure if you are a doctor or medical student you would get quite a lot out of this book. I was hoping for a broader description of the afterlife.  I have no doubt the doctor did visit heaven, I just wish he had written more about it than about his condition.

B0090EHVMC|4.0|The Lorax<br />It was very enjoyable.  My granddaughter had fun watching it.  I enjoy watching video and reading books on my Kindle.
B002O3APL0|2.0|A lot of the comedy was predictable.  A lot of it was tedious.<br /><br />The funniest scene was the fast-paced car and truck chase scene which unfortunately turned into the tedious and painful funeral scene.<br /><br />I watched it as an Amazon Instant Video which doesn't provide any extras or subtitles.  I find subtitles useful for undertanding heavy accents and whispered speech.  You get more bang for the buck by buying a used DVD.
B00632HWOG|4.0|Wish I read my mail more often, my goal is to check it everyday. It keeps me in touch with family and friends.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|I love well made puzzle games for my Android phone.  This game is a lot of fun.  It is a variation of the sliding puzzle games.  I got it for free but I would easily put the money down on the add free version when the new levels come out.

B00A757EFW|3.0|I love the original Pac Man.  I am so glad I was able to get this game on my phone for free.  I have to say though without a good controller it is just not the same experience.  Good enough to give me a fix when I am jonesing but not enough for me to love it.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|A heart warming documentary that makes you stop and really think about what you're eating.  Makes you aware of the importance of eating fresh whole foods and the health hazzards of our modern convenient processed foods. Amazing to realize the corruption that has shaped our food industry. Anything healthy and natural is always looked down upon not only from the food industry but also the medical industry because it would not be profitable to have a nation full of healthy people.
B008G12ERC|4.0|The 2nd Law is probably one of Muse's weaker offerings but is still a very good album overall.<br /><br />The album begins with Supremacy, a song that feels like a callback to the kind of rallying battle-cry ballad similar to what we heard with Uprising. Where Uprising was very up-tempo and energized, however, Supremacy feels a bit plodding at times in my opinion. Moreover, some of the lyrics in Supremacy just don't feel up to snuff with Muse's typical quality (it might just be one line that bugs me, to be honest - \\"Embedded spies brainwashing our children to be mean\\" gets a mental eye-roll out of me every time I hear it). Further into the song, however, there is a gradual build in power and the ending is a bit more satisfying than the song is at the start.<br /><br />The second song, Madness, was one where, the first time I heard it, I was worried it was going to be a pretty generic pop-rock song. I am so very glad I was wrong. Like Supremacy, the song gets better further in, but I would argue that the payoff in Madness is much, much better than the one in Supremacy. Madness has quickly become one of my favorite songs on the album, beginning with an under-stated, calm power that soon builds into a cacophonous finale.<br /><br />Next we have Panic Station, one of my absolute favorite songs on the entire CD. Right out of the gate, the song is powerful, upbeat and energized. Matt really shows off the power of his voice in this track with the little riffs and embellishments he adds after each lyric and the instrumentation is equally skillful. Every part about this song is great and it's the one I crank my speakers up for every time.<br /><br />Panic Station is followed by the equally impressive Survival, the \\"official song of the 2012 Olympics\\". And this song is more than deserving of the title. It's a powerful, adrenaline fused ballad perfect for getting revved up for doing something awesome. Think a song somewhere along the lines of Butterflies and Hurricanes, but with a quicker build.<br /><br />Follow Me, the next track on the CD, is a little bit of a disappointing follow-up to the preceding trilogy of fantastic songs, but it's pretty good in it's own right. Kind of like Supremacy, it starts out pretty well, then feels a little weak with an underwhelming lyric or two, then gradually builds into a pretty satisfying payoff.<br /><br />Animals is a pretty interesting song. It follows the usual pattern of a lot of the songs on the CD; a quiet start with a gradual, powerful build. I'd call it a middle of the road song for the CD. It's very good and I really enjoy it, but it's not my top pick.<br /><br />Explorers is a slow, bittersweet ballad. It took me some getting used to but overtime this song has grown on me. At its worst, it feels a little long but at its best it's a great song that feels like a slightly better version of Unintended.<br /><br />Big Freeze is bound to become movie trailer music and I mean this in the best possible way. It's energized, it's upbeat while still remaining serious within its lyrics. It's probably one of my favorite songs on the CD and I don't have much else to say about it that I haven't said about other songs on the album; it's good for a lot of the same reasons that the other songs are good.<br /><br />Next we have Save Me and Liquid State. They're two different songs but, to be honest, they feel like they blend together a little bit, so I'm going to talk about them at the same time. Save Me is a slow, easy-listening song whereas Liquid State is a bit more dynamic and angry. While both songs are by no means bad, I feel like they're probably two of the weakest offerings on the album. Chris has a fantastic voice and writes music very well, probably better than most things that I've heard typically played on the radio, but I found myself missing the raw power of Matt's voice throughout these two songs. They're by no means bad and they're steadily growing on me (there's some little touches in thesetwo songs that I didn't notice the first time which I'm rapidly coming to appreciate more and more), but I've been known to skip them on occasion.<br /><br />The 2nd Law: Unsustainable is probably going to be the most polarizing song on the album. In it, Muse takes a moving string section and blends it with a harsh, dubstep-like sound. I personally really like this song but for those who read the word \\"dubstep\\" and started shaking their heads, this might not be the one for you. Nevertheless, I'd urge you to give the song a listen as I feel it's really very good. And, whether you love or hate dubstep, you have to give the band credit where it's due; all of the instrumentation you hear is the band playing their instruments. With the exception of the modulated voice over, none of the other noises were, to my knowledge, made by a synthesizer.<br /><br />The CD finishes up with The 2nd Law: An Isolated System. Isolated System is seemingly very calm while at the same time stirring, the audio chosen to play in the background giving it a more urgent feel. I don't have a lot to say about this song, not because it's bad necessarily, but because the song keeps roughly the same feel throughout until it gradually fades. It's not the kind of ending I would have liked for the album, especially considering how fantastic the third movement of Exogenesis was in the previous CD, but then Exo-genny is a tough act to follow.<br /><br />All in all, I'm a big fan of The 2nd Law. I don't know as this album will win over a lot of new fans, necessarily. If you're trying to get a friend into Muse, I'd recommend having them listen to something like Origin of Symmetry or Absolution first, but I'd argue that this album is sure to please Muse fans. The more I listen to it, the more I love it.

I'm a huge fan of old country, country rock and southern rock. These boys go it all. Don't know enough yet to write a long review but I'm glad I've been introduced to them. Look forward to more music from Whiskey Myers.

B003TSEEDY|3.0|Sorry, I just don't think the book is that remarkable.  It's basically just a teenager's diary.  You can guess the big secret long before it is revealed.

0316228532|5.0|I was very pleased to hear that J.K. Rowling was going to be writing a book geared towards adults, especially so soon after she wrapped up the Harry Potter series. The Casual Vacancy is definitely for adults, and if parents are wondering if it's a book that their children who love Harry Potter can read, I would definitely say no. It deals with very strong adult themes, includes swearing, drug and sexual references.<br />But looking at it as an adult book, it is wonderful. You are introduced to a community, and become familiar with its ins and outs. You see how it is run and the people that live there. You are able to catch a glimpse into their lives.<br />For the people complaining about how many characters are in this books: have you heard of Tolstoy? War and Peace had a slew of characters, all of which were important to the story. Rowling has the same thing. Sure there are a bunch of characters and it gets hard to keep track of everyone. If you asked me, I wouldn't be able to name them all. But they are all equally important to the story she told. They added complexitiy to the story. It shows how complex this world is, at any given moment, during and given point in time, no matter what is happening around us, everyone is dealing with their own problems. I loved being able to delve into more than one person's life and at the end of the book, I found myself wanting to know more about what the future held for everyone in the story, especially the younger generation.<br />I thought it was a superb book, and when I wasn't reading it, I was wondering about it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|Fun, creative, insanely adventurous! This game is full of eerie and action packed fun that I would recommend to mystery lovers every where!!!

0823003590|5.0|This truly is a five star book for those wishing to start to develop their drawing skills further than the average joe doodler. The simple explanations are well written and can be easily understood. Each page is packed with drawing diagrams and processes that explains Williams thoughts on chiaroscuro and other aspects. This book has EVERYTHING you need to know about drawing a portrait with a level of competence. If your one that has no opportunity to go to a school to learn drawing or unable to afford education then this book is for you. It is one of the few books I'd recommend to add to your self education library. If your a parent with a child wanting to draw then this is also a good book for them, it will give them a very good head start in how to draw properly compared to the other &#34;how to draw&#34; books, that are on the market. I first was introduced to this book by my wife who got it from the library for me, and it changed my way of thinking and my illustration style completely!<br /><br />Cheers,<br />Rick.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|How can a TV show in its sixth season be getting better? I don't know, but I love it that it does! TBBT is the best thing on TV because it's about SMART people for a refreshing change instead of the usual fare that looks for the dumbest and most ridiculous characters from &#34;real&#34; life! I'd rather hang with the smart folks! The cast of the show is amazing and everyone is perfectly cast and very believably acted! Bravo!
B005GRTNVE|5.0|This group is the best of the best when it comes to harmony of the<br />male tenor voice!

Excellent, excellent!!
1742200206|5.0|My wife and I live in Fairfield County, Connecticut. We're about an hour away from the City by train, and we visit regularly.<br />So why would we be interested in a guide book to the city?<br />Several reasons:<br />-  The City is ever-changing: it's useful to find out about new attractions, or things we haven't discovered yet.<br />-  When we get visitors, it's good to have a guide book to lend to them, when they decide to take a train into the city.<br />-  And, of course, there's the purely selfish reason of finding out whether the guide book reveals any of our favourite haunts.<br /><br />As it happens, this guide reveals some secrets. Unfortunately for us - but very fortunate for visiting tourists. Details? Hell no. Read the book*.<br /><br />The guide is very well put together, and I'd strongly recommend reading it well in advance of your visit. It outlines several ways of spending a few days in the City, from various points of view (including LGBT). Since some of the suggestions (such as a performance at the Metropolitan Opera) involve prior booking, give yourself plenty of time. If you're going to the trouble of visiting the City,it makes sense to do it properly.<br /><br />We found nothing to complain about in the descriptions. It's an accurate description of the City, in early 2013. The built in map of Manhattan is OK. The only objection is the subway map, which looks like the standard MTA offering, shrunk down. The information is correct, but it's printed in microscopic type. You should be able to find better on the Web.<br /><br />Recommended. Hope you enjoy your visit.<br /><br />* I've been reconsidering my earlier New York brusqueness. Don't tell anyone else about them, but try the following New York attractions, all of which are mentioned in the book:<br />Bryant Park<br />The Frick Collection<br />The Roerich Museum<br />The High Line<br />The Campbell Apartment
1451648537|3.0|I'm thinking SJ is like Bluebeard but instead of ex-wives he has former friends and engineers hanging in his room.  The meanness of this man is legion and legend.  Isaacson's focus just seems like a 900 page chant that he smelled, was petty, vicious, shifty and pathetic, but hey soooooo brilliant.  Truthfully, I couldn't stand Jobs after I read this book and plan to donate the book to my local library.  I am with John Sculley's wife -- I don't want him looking at me (from the dustjacket).  I'd rather waltz with a tarantula.

B005LAII80|5.0|So much of DREDD unfolds like his law enforcement exploits from the trades.  Mark my words: as comic book adaptations go, you're not likely to see anything this faithful in your lifetime.  (For the record, you're reading the thoughts of a tremendous comic book fan - started reading them in the early 1970's, in fact - as well as a connoisseur of most comic-inspired films.  If nothing else, I'd like to think I know what I'm talking about when it comes to comics-inspired properties.)  Prior to DREDD, I'd long believed personally that no one could top how perfectly SUPERMAN - THE MOVIE and SUPERMAN II captured the look, feel, and themes of that format.  But now?  I just might have to rethink my favorite comic-book-to-film rankings.<br /><br />If nothing else, that's what makes me so very, very sad - due to its poor performance at the box office, I can't imagine it likely that we'll see this cast and this crew afforded a second opportunity to deliver more spills, chills, and kills to the silver screen.  IMDB.com shows the film was budgeted at around $50M, and the last box office projection shows a paltry $13M in returns.  Odds are good that this kind of delivery will never happen again, and I can't begin to tell you what a disservice to fandom that is.  This was the kind of motion picture I hated to end.  It's simply that good.<br /><br />(NOTE: the following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and characters.  If you're the kind of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then I'd encourage you to skip down to the last paragraph for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at `things to come,' then read on ...)<br /><br />The world, as we knew it, is gone.  Most countries have been annihilated; and, so far as America is concerned, there's only Mega City One, an immense sprawling city where those who remain alive fight a daily battle to survive.  The only thing protecting what's left of humanity from the chaos are the Judges - specially trained law enforcement officers drafted into service to capture criminals and pronounce instant sentences (\\"death\\" being the most common).  One of the most effective is Judge Dredd (played by Karl Urban).  Paired with the rookie Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), Dredd is dispatched to investigate a triple homicide in the Peach Trees, a super-skyscraper housing Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), the head of a syndicate that holds control over everyone one of its 200 floors.  Ma-Ma deals in a new drug, Slo-Mo, and she won't take kindly to these two officers invading her turf.<br /><br />It's a slam-bang action/adventure from start to finish, brought to you by director Pete Travis, a relative newcomer to the scene if you check out his biography on IMDB.com.  The script by Alex Garland is smart with a decidedly retro- quality to it, and much of it flows like a terrific mix of hardboiled dialogue with noir undertones.  What could have been reduced to one action-set-piece after another is, instead, a fairly logical progression - cops show up, cops get trapped, cops turn the tables on their attackers, and cops make it to the showdown - and the intelligence of the entire production benefits from it.  To his credit, Garland shares screen time with Dredd's creators, John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra, as its clear he `cut his teeth' on much of their source material.<br /><br />I won't belabor the issue.  Instead, I'll encourage you to head out to your favorite video store today and pick up a rental if you're not convinced that this one is worth the blind buy.  I did, and, now that I've seen it, I'm buying a copy.  I'll definitely wear out the tracks on this one, as it's the perfect action flick for any Friday, Saturday or Sunday night ... or ANY night, come to think of it.  I may go watch it again now!<br /><br />DREDD is produced by DNA Films, IM Global, Peach Trees, Reliance Big Entertainment, Reliance Big Pictures, and Rena Film.  Asfor the technical specifications, everything looks and sounds exceptional, though I'll admit one sequence that had Dredd - with his best `Dirty Harry' voice - speaking over a building loudspeaker system, and I had to listen very close to catch all of it (thankfully, Dredd's a man of few words).  There's a plethora of special features available on the disc, including a brief retrospective on the judge's career; an in-depth look at the film's special effects; and a series of short featurettes exploring futuristic gear, story locations, and more.  It's a nice package - where's the commentary? - and it only left me wanting even more.<br /><br />HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION POSSIBLE.  Yes, everything positive you've heard about this adaptation of DREDD is true.  It's an exciting and visceral experience from start to finish with a hit-it-outta-the-park performance by Karl Urban as the pivotal judge, jury, and executioner.  Comparisons to THE RAID: REDEMPTION are warranted, I guess; but, whereas I had problems with how the plot progressed in THE RAID, so much of DREDD flowed much more organically as it related to the struggles of all the main players.  I had minor quibbles with the usage of slow-motion sequences - that's always a bit of a gripe of mine - though I'm comfortable saying that this story clearly had a stated, artistic purpose for using it when and where they did.  And, definitely, this is a faithful adaptation of the Dredd I know from the comic books.for the technical specifications, everything looks and sounds exceptional, though I'll admit one sequence that had Dredd - with his best `Dirty Harry' voice - speaking over a building loudspeaker system, and I had to listen very close to catch all of it (thankfully, Dredd's a man of few words).

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book!  I couldn't put it down!  It's full of action, adventure, romance, and then some! It's definitely on my favorites.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|Completely surprised by this movie.  Forget about that other thing with Stallone.  The acting, action, effects in this film are outstanding.  Karl Urban is spot on as Dredd.  There is nothing I would change about this film.  And, to note, I have never seen the comics, and I had absolutely no expectations for this movie.  It is great--watch it, you will not be disappointed.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|I do not go on there and spill my insiders....never have nor never will.  Enjoy seeing what others write if I have time but that is not my cup of tea.
B00A31UXLW|4.0|A good read , excellent developement of characters and good tight plot that keeps reading to the end.I am more than happy to recomend this book Bill Starke
B009O2XY12|2.0|I have not figured out exactly how to play this.  The matching of balls I like but not enough instructions at the beginning to suit me.  I sure hope to learn more about this one.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|Norwegian noir, and it's okay.  Frankly, I'm getting tired of the series.  The ex-cop anti-hero goes after creepy bad guys because he cares about his ex-girlfriend and her son, and there is LOTS of detail about how Russian gangs craft their torture tools, how they are applied, their effect on human flesh.  Ditto for illegal drugs, real and imaginary.  The original must be reasonably well-written, as the translation reads well.  A victimless guilty pleasure, but you learn nothing useful about the Big Picture (like, why are Russian gangsters in Norway? How many? What all do they get up to?)
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. It's really handy when you need to figure our how much battery power you have left. Get this app!
0553328255|5.0|I grew up reading short stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle about Sherlock Holmes.<br />I tried stories about Sherlock Holmes by other authors but no one else came close.<br />The paperbacks, 2 volumes, came with a box to hold the books in.<br />I am savoring the stories.
B005V2S7FW|4.0|After several well publicized password leaks by large organizations, I decided to use a password manager to create and store more secure passwords.  I wanted something that kept a local copy of the passwords, but also distributed it securely to other devices I use (a Mac, a Windows PC, an Android phone, and an Android tablet).  LastPass is one of several programs that seems to fit the bill.<br /><br />It works well.  There are only two major problems:  (1) the automatic fill-in sometimes can't figure out or remember what page it's on, and (2) the selection list on Android is unnecessarily small, which makes it difficult to use.
B008FPOIT6|2.0|This book started out interesting, but there was a lack of action.  It was hard to keep focused on it.  There was little excitement that made me want to keep reading.
B000FCK65W|5.0|This story was made even more real when I visited the East Tenement Museum in Manhattan.  To go through the rooms, to see how closely people lived, to have a picture in my mind where the baby slept so she could have fresh air......all the descriptions in the book came alive.  What a wonderful story of the human spirit, the strength of character and the tenacity and grit to persevere through extremely physical and emotional times.  How would we measure up today?  Worth a discussion!
1419707671|5.0|My son loves these books.  Fun to read together or on his own.  I'm sure they will get read many more times.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|Though I grew up during this time period, I was totally ignorant of what went on at this time period.  This is an endearing love story between &#34;two kids&#34;, unconditional, pure and lasting love that was able to withstand the test of time.
B00A88FLI0|5.0|I purchased this set recently and I had so much fun building it. A great set for those minifigure collecters out there. It comes with all four elemental swords and the hard to find golden ninja! I also love the golden mech it comes with. But I wish the mech could grip the sword it holds a bit firmer, because sometimes it slips out of his hand. Overall really great set and I know if you purchase this set you will enjoy it!
B004I744AS|5.0|This is the best dictionary that I have found for my kindle fire. You cant go wrong with this app. plus it was free.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Unfortunately, this book was too short and and read too quickly.  I've read all the Ryan/Clark books and love them. I hope Clancy has several more to come!
B002T9H2LK|5.0|Quentin Tarantino plus Brad Pitt, why wouldn't you enjoy it?  The theme was just off the plausable that made it appealing
B00008BXJ6|5.0|An absolute great album that contains much of the humorous and catchy riffs and vocals as AC/DC has always put out. High Voltage is one of those albums that you would like to experience with.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|Adele never ceases to surprise me with her musical interpretation, love her earthy voice, never seem to tire of listening to
B0090L5SM0|5.0|TIme I is contains a story of its own as Jari had mentioned. Each song are very resonating and melodic in both tone and voice. Give this album a try if you happen to be a melodic, symphonic, death metal fan.
B006FE83UE|5.0|Gregory Peck plus the one of my favourite story equals two favourites in one, a movie to watch over and over again,
B008G59IBI|5.0|Finally the end of Green Day's 2012 trilogy albums. Tre contains many sad songs that are very emotional for the listeners. Each song is telling a story which asks for the listeners' sympathy in a way. It is a quite different album than Uno and Dre, it contains a much slower rhythm and more serious and romantic lyrics are both touching and resonating.<br /><br />It's a highly recommended album to any punk rock fans and GD fans of course.
B00005JLEU|5.0|My niece was really thrilled to get these.  I haven't seen them but she has told me she is very happy with them.  Definitely for the younger crowd.
B007FGPYTE|5.0|Louder Than Bombs is arguably The Smiths' best compilation album during their career. It contains mostly new songs such as Panic, London, Sheila Take a Bow, etc. are all exclusive to this album. I'm surprised that this album wasn't put out as a studio album.<br /><br />It is a must own for the 80s music fans.
B000PMG16U|5.0|How could anyone not be thrilled with these?  Star Wars is timeless and it's really great to be able to get them in Blu-ray.
B000P24CHU|5.0|Communique contains a more evolving atmosphere in Dire Straits' musical direction at that time. Each song is slow and rhythmic that most enjoyable while relaxing and enjoying one's life. Well, Communique certainly contains those elements that will accommodate any listener who enjoys chill and relaxing music.
B006P96PAO|5.0|A must see movie. A movie for every man. Go with your wife, you will not regret it. See it.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Good job until the ending.  How difficult is it to be a PA and a father and have family issues.  This book is well written and gives you a peek into dad's thoughts as his colleague PA is going for a guilty verdict.  Who are the guilty ones?  Sometimes it hard to really know especially when you are on the other side of the bar.
B002UD56I6|5.0|This product is just i looking... good things for good price... i recomend this product if you like the good things!
