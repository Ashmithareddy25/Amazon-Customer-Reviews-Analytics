B001RNO474|5|New album this summer!!
B00BT8W2VM|5|Beautiful mask...We used in Magic Flute
B001VNBAOA|1|Unfortunately this product did not hold up at all for me. In less than a week, the \\"shiny covering\\" that is attached to the leather was pealing off. This pretty much ruined the belt for my intended purpose. The do run quite small, i would say 2 sizes smaller than pants size. I got one size larger as all Dickies run a little small in the waist, and it was still on the second to last hole.    And heres a real brain scratcher... Dickies belt, Dickies pants, and the belt BARELY fits through the belt loops on the pants. and even worse once the shiny covering has pealed off leaving a rough, dull, untreated leather that causes more friction.    On the plus side, I do really like the look of the buckle. a little poky bending over, but still looks good.
B000Z9DNUK|5|I bought a 6-pack package for my son, who is 6'3&#34; tall, long in the waist. Talk about hard to fit!!! The shirts fit. No scratch, no itch. His boss was complaining: he wasn't dressed well enough. He should wear a T-shirt, and long sleeved dress shirts with slacks. OK, he's 22 years old, and not into fashion. He needs comfortable; his boss (female) needs professional. Enter: Jockey! No, Jockey, we Americans do NOT take you for granted. Yes, we do understand that we live in the most prosperous nation on Earth! Yes, we do realize that fit and comfort do not come at no cost. Thank you, Jockey, for offering sizes other than S/M/L/XL at a cost less than a dinner for four, which lasts for but one mealtime. One must prioritize...
B00CF74K2A|2|I was really hoping this would turn out nicely, but it didn't :(  The material is so stiff and unfriendly, that is, it's coarse.  It doesn't feel comfortable against the skin.  Again, the color is very much how it is pictured (I ordered the green) but that's the only good thing I really have to say about this dress.  Overall, I don't recommend this dress.  Don't waste your money.
B00L3H0ES2|5|The cover up came much faster than expected! It's beautiful much better quality than I expected also!! Very nice can't wait to wear it!
B00BEZT6DM|3|Bought this to give myself a larger tush for a Nicki Minaj costume, but the padding in these panties are weak.  It gave my rump a nice boost, but not to the level in which I needed it, so I ended up returning.
B007O6I2QM|5|use it daily, working just as designed definitively reccomend it lots of options will miss it when it wears out
B00IUTM0ZG|5|Fits and looks as expected.
B00N5PP7PK|4|I am looking forward to using it on our upcoming backcountry hikes. I plan to roll it up, put it in the bag provided and use it as a pillow.
B00FJ5LI3O|5|great wallet
B00EA7SL50|5|First things first, I own a few pairs of the Volcom Frickin Modern Chino shorts as well as some board shorts (Nano, New Jetty). If you are sizing based on the modern chino you want to size down. I'm a 33 in the modern chino and a 32 in the V4S. If you are sizing based on boardshorts then you should size up. I'm a 31 in boardshorts but a 32 in the V4S.<br /><br />Sizing aside, these are fantastic shorts. They have the Frickin Chino look but boardshort material so the are excellent for hanging on the beach/pool, taking a dip and then going right to skate session or drinking beers on the patio watching the sunset. I will be ordering a few more of these in different colors.<br /><br />My only complaint is that the stone is not embroidered as it is on the chino short. It is silk screened. I dont feel it was enough to dock it a star as these are excellent shorts. The look great on and off the beach.
B00JGMXB4A|4|Great
B004VPBY00|4|I love this shirt and call it my Dexter shirt and I am going to order more in different colors too.<br /><br />The only reason I gave 4 stars was because that picture is deceiving, the collar on it is a different shade of green and you notice that right away.  The picture makes it look like its all the same color but its not. I am still happy with it though.
B00BIO0ANE|5|Got these for my daughter and she loves them! Wish I could find more Moshi clothes for girls in her size at affordable prices.
B00BZ5VYRW|5|My daughter is a little on the small size, glad I went with one size smaller than her clothes!<br />Great costume, washes up beautifully, on gentle of course.
B006C9CI80|3|The fabric and size are ok, but the print is smaller than shown tin the picture.
B00K1Y5V1I|5|Once AGAIN these jeans have rocked my freaking world! I am losing weight and didn't think that I would be able to fit into a size 10 yet (to give those of you wondering about what size to get,  im 5&#34;9 and weigh about 185) and these jeans fit me perfectly! They are so slimming and flattering. I'm going to get another pair, or 5 :D lol.
B0014BMJ30|3|excellent fabric and design qualityl  but much too large size compred to European sizes
B00BN4WAIW|5|I knew this item was going to take a while to get to me, as it stated clearly on the item page. This item took 18 days to arrive from overseas. If you are buying it for a party, allow shipping time.<br /><br />The quality is really good. the brocade fabric is sturdy brushed cotton, lined, the boning is legit as are the front hooks and back grommets. I am really impressed for the low price. It is a good costume piece for me. I will modify the heck out of it, but I am thrilled I don't have to sew the corset itself. I made one by hand once and it was extremely difficult.
B00BD2SKY2|2|Way too small- I can button it, but it gaps and stretches, now room to move; arms feel constricted and it uncomfortable to wear. It's now a goal shirt.
B009AFC4N2|5|works well !!
B000I98N20|4|Fits as expected. Very comfortable.
B00AHTKF86|5|I love this bathing suit bottom it's very stylish. The color is pretty but a little different than the picture it's more of a green than a blue tint
B00I0XXRRW|5|My husband said &#34;wow&#34; when I threw this on this morning.  Lol I had no makeup on and a pony tail but got a wow heh heh.<br /><br />I bought it to try because the price was low so I didn't expect much.  I am more than pleased with how it fits and looks on and am picking up more for an upcoming trip to Hawaii.
B00B5MJQWA|4|I'm so glad I read the reviews before I purchased this dress! I usually wear a small-to-medium, but I chose the large based on what everyone said about it. It's soft material, snug but not too tight, and covers my behind, which is what I wanted. The color is just like the picture. I especially like the snap-neckline, which allows me to show as much or as little cleavage as I want. I'm going to wear it over leggings with my boots.
B00CHSFBWA|5|I really love this dress!  It is a great dress for the beach and just wearing around the house.  The quality is very nice. I am also so happy to find a &#34;one size&#34; dress that actually fits larger women like me.  Usually the &#34;one size&#34; things fit only women who are small to medium, which is very disappointing.  Thank you very much!
B00ALSQOYW|4|Loved the flow and drape; loved how the fabric was tiered to give it movement. Loved the pattern on the hanger. Didn't love the pattern on a larger chest. Would be perfect for travel as came out of packaging absolutely wrinkle free. Returned to exchange for a solid color.
B00HECQQZK|3|The stitching was loose & perhaps made the hat somewhat looked & fit large.
B00N75YM1S|5|Great dress!
B00F6MECRO|5|Fits great love them
B0014JXLMK|3|small is small and tight, perfect if thats what youre looking for.<br />but it does run smaller than other brand.<br />keeps me warm, feels a bit itchy sometimes though
B00Q6QKH9G|4|Nice sweater, though it had a peculiar chemical smell to it--hence 4 instead of 5 stars.  Have washed it once so far, and it still smells a little.  Will wash it one more time to see if goes away.
B00D2KM6EI|5|I bought this for school for my son. It is great quality and looks so cute on him. Great quality.
B00Z9HITIO|5|This very nice, is the perfect garment for baby, looks so cute.
B00IGSAGZ2|4|I ordered a pair of capri pants by the designer and they fit perfectly.  These shorts run a little small, but I like them because the length is absolutely perfect and what I was looking for.
B0007YRB1A|2|The band was the right size, the cup too big and the material very scratchy. I'm washing it now and hope it is at least more comfortable next wear
B00GT1R4NU|4|I like
B00MML3L0G|5|I got this dress for a wedding bc it was on sale I didn't think anything of it but everyone keeps complimenting me everytime I wear it
B001M24C2W|5|I love this shirt.  It has bcome my favorite maternity shirt.  I have received numerous compliments about it.  It's perfect for summer.  I'm now 37 weeks pgnt and it fit's my big belly perfectly.  :-)
B0042GKAP8|5|great shirt
B00G9WGXSQ|5|Great
B006UJ3RD2|5|I bought a bunch of them at CVS for $19.99.  I wear a 36B bra & the XL size fits perfectly.  They are machine washable but I take the little padded cups out first, in case they get warped in wash.  I do not put these bras in the dryer: I let them air dry.  I've worn them several times in the past 2 months & they're still in great shape & give just enough support for me.
B007KC3TWW|4|Bought it for my Husband he liked it!! It washed up beautifully and it's real soft! T-shirt quality seems good!!
B00TWIROIC|5|Awesome shirt. love to get more I only got two
B00EXU7VWS|3|But beautiful.<br />Did not return it, because Granddaughter will still lo.ve it when she grow it to it
B00FF9VD8E|5|I love the renewal bamboo fiber and the whimsical patterns and colors.  They were sized accurately.  They have held up well to repeated washings so far.  Very cool.
B00FY6H2J2|3|I got an extra small and it literally fit like a medium/large! It hung down past my thighs. But for halloween it's perfect since I'm gonna wear leggings with it anyway.
B00TG2JYFA|5|Love it! Fits perfectly!
B005M2984A|1|Fell apart upon removing it from the bag. Really really cheap and stapled together. Complete waste of time and money.
B00CE5DZLK|5|cool
B0055QJMC6|3|These are ok.  Expected them to be more hearty and less flimsy but for a costume they are of.  Think they are a bit overpriced for what you get
B00IUC603G|4|Awesome color!
B00LVSGMC0|4|cute but kinda small
B005X5HGXQ|5|LOVE!!!!  great fitting and very comfortable
B00KQQVC3W|5|Super fast shipping.  Just what I wanted to gift to my dad!  He loved it!
B00J4W0SE8|2|I was looking for a shawl that had a way of closing in the front without &#34;alterations&#34;.  This was not it...
B00VX3EPH2|4|Comfortable to sleep in even in hot weather.
B005GYGEXC|3|If you work out, these will take the abuse and laundering.  I hang to dry but could easily dry if I needed them quickly.  But several and always be ready to move.
B006R83OQG|5|so cute
B00GBA5XXW|5|I am in my early twenties and have a slim athletic build. And I sweat A LOT. I've sweat through everything, including a suit jacket before. Wish I had known about these shirts much earlier...they are AMAZING. Seriously, wonderful product. Can not rave about it enough.
B0072LC18O|4|This fits fine, it's a little thin, I would have liked it to be a bit thicker, but it's good. I am very small busted so it supports me fine, I don't know if it would be good support if you have a large chest or not.
B00536SMAQ|1|I bought these for my hubby to replace his long time famous brand sandals.  Big mistake.  They look good and seem to be comfortable, but are falling apart in less than two months with minimal wearing time.  The leather is pretty much disintegrating in multiple places on both shoes, where the laces loop through and the tab in the back.  Plus the band around the ankle is coming unsewed - who knows what will be next.  For the price I paid for these shoes I am absolutely blown away at what garbage they are.  Worst purchase I ever made.
B0007P4BOO|3|I like this shirt for the fabric, which is soft and easy to iron, and the french barrel cuffs (it comes with cuff clips or you can use any pair of standard cufflinks).  However, the color (blue with lime stripes) is *loud* to say the least.  I figure I will wear a sweater over it just so the cuffs and collar will show.
B005B8J04I|5|stylish and functional
B00AOCX3TE|5|i purchased this sweater for the lenghth and skull pic its fashionable comfotable and yes it covers my bumm highly reccomended. i am 5'6 160lbs L
B00VLO0OEQ|3|The fabric had a smell!
B004NIFC7G|4|this set very beautiful, the colors of the fabric and texture impeccable, a model for her girls casual recommend it, the seller delivered on time and in perfect condition.
B00DGG77VK|4|I bought this because it was listed under my Amazon search for women's clothes made in USA. It's not. It's made in China. I like it, but I was very disappointed to find that it was not American-made.
B00KCORP8Y|4|The bottom is a little small but the top fits so perfectly it doesn't make much of a difference.  I was also very surprised by the quality considering the price.  It's very well made and I received a ton of compliments!  4 stars is because I received it the day after the 4th of July :( despite expedited shipping.
B00EKS8HA8|4|very nice dress
B00DM2HN76|4|Wow, this is one of the most versatile go-to dresses I've ever seen. The jersey is stretch, and not at all frictiony, so the sleeves should easily slide in & out of your blazers, jackets, sweaters, whatever. Not that you'd need anything over it -- the neckline is almost perfect. It's not a crew-neckline, so it doesn't skim your neck so closely you feel like a nun, but it's still perfectly modest and office-appropriate. It's a bateau neckline that gets its \\"skin\\" via width of opening, not depth.<br /><br />The modest cling nicely highlights a medium bust, and the waist narrows enough to give you ladylike curves but not squeeze too tight. It has a tiered-panel A-line skirt that drapes fine (although unlike the torso/top-half, the skirt is unlined, so it doesn't feel as substantial). The degree of stretch is right -- comfortable and flattering without being overly clingy (though do size up or down according to your body-revealing preferences; because of the stretchiness a range of sizes will fit you).<br /><br />I want to give this dress five stars because it's so wearable (it's very easy to imagine as a daily staple, and is pretty easy care as well; it does say dry clean only, but I washed the terrific grey version of the [[ASIN:B00DM2FZVW Anne Klein Women's Jersey Swing Dress]] in cold water [delicate/handwash cycle], and line dried, and it came out just fine).<br /><br />HOWEVER there still flaws. 1) it's a pullover dress with a very shallow back zipper that's much too short to be useful except as a nuisance since my shoulder-length hair keeps getting painfully tangled in the hook; 2) because the unlined skirt-half is relatively thin, it's much less forgiving and compressing than the top half; 3) the skirt tiers are sewn imperfectly (this is not, obviously, couture), so there is small bunching at multiple seams that horizontally cross the skirt half of the dress.<br /><br />{Aside: don't let amazon's image of the black version of this dress mislead you. It's shown here with silver evening heels, but is probably not a dress you'd wear to a semi-formal/formal event no matter what accessories you added. It'd be fine for doing out to dinner, etc., but is just too basic to wear to, for example, a wedding.}<br /><br />Oh, and the included belt is junk -- just use one of your own, and/or snip off the belt loop threads entirely.
B00IZ9B6IS|1|Looks soo cheaper . Bad quality .
B00DRF5YVA|3|I like the top but it fits more like a medium. That's really all I have to say about that
B002HWSB64|2|Be carefull because they are a nice pair of  jeans  but the calf is so skinny that I couldn't put the leg inside.
B00EYZJ0JY|3|Panache's underwires consistently come up too high underneath my arms.  But the straps are amazing.  Band size is normal, not too tight or loose.
B002YQ2FVU|3|One thing that I love about dance tights is that the waist bands tend not to pinch.  I have been wearing these tights for years and have loved them.  For some reason, Capezio seems to have changed the waistband and it digs in more than it used to.  The tights are still wearable, just not quite as good.  I still like the hold and stretch fabric as it resists runs and travels through the wash well.  It also is not shiny AT ALL, a plus for those of us with a more athletic build who don't want to emphasize our thighs.
B00BZ5AAC2|5|I love this dress!  I am a very plus sized lady with a low self esteem.  But, this dress made me feel like a knock out!!  It is awesome!
B00EMB67VO|5|Just the way the picture is . . Very pleased! Fits well, looks great on me. Would def recommend to friends
B00CQ3DKME|2|as soon as i put producton my pants ripped very then material  definetly see through not what i was expecting not to happy
B00KBSANWG|5|This is a good quality shirt. The shirt is a dickies item and is great for cooler weather as it is heavy duty.  Shipping was fairly quick.  The price was much lower than other places that carry this same item.  A must have for a &#34;Car guy.&#34;
B001VGP4C6|5|I got this as a gift to replace my old trusty cap. My old one had a single zip pocket in the side, which became more useful than I'd ever imagine. This one has three. The stitching is well done and strong. There are two flat zip pockets just above the bill, which I use to carry some band aids, alcohol wipes, and a $100 for emergencies. I find that I forget it's even there until I really need it, which has happened once already (I went to the grocery store and was already rung up when I realized that I'd forgotten my wallet. Hat money saved the day.) The side pocket is expandable, and good for smaller items. Just make sure they're not hard objects. If you take a spill and hit the side of your head you're gonna get whatever's in that pocket jammed into your temple, so keeping rocks in it would probably be a bad idea.
B000YAIGRU|5|As a first time mom to an 8 week old, who thought she was totally prepared for baby, I realized quickly that although I had lots of cute things, not all were practical. These booties are not only practical, but adorable as well. I also love that even though my baby is only 8 weeks old, and the size is good up until 6 months, they still fit him because of the adjustable snaps. As we prepare for what will probably be another painfully cold New England winter, I will be stocking up on a few more pairs of these for my little guy; they are warm, cute and stay on his feet!
B000H1ZU02|5|Loved it!  It's more thick than thin.  Nice material and very elegant.  I got lots of compliments on it
B00TKVZ42O|5|Daughter loves them but won't fit for long go up a size I thought I was safe with the large but I have no small 8 year old.now I see she can not wear bra at all cause so small so make sure you go up a few sizes other than that nice
B00AM2RNJC|5|Love them but they run small!
B003H12ERQ|5|Fit my son perfect and he's happy with them
B00LCZE7WY|5|Great Transaction.  Description matched item received.
B00AHAGE08|3|It is a sweet little dress but unfortunately it had a permanent marking on it straight from the package. Also, for the price that it is, it should be in better quality in general.
B008K6ZEC0|2|Got the bikini and was just as pictured,  the bottom are not tie sides but instead bra extend straps. One side broke while it on though. An easy fix yet still disappointed being that it was brand new. Top ties are barely long enough to tie.
B00IMB2N5E|4|Great shirt, but flows down a bit.
B00NQ74M8K|4|I love this product but it is a bit snug I should have ordered the next size up.
B0051U18L4|5|This is one of those examples where you buy something with a certain expectation and the items happen to live up to that.<br /><br />They're socks, I wanted them to be absorbent, comfortable, warm, and not slide whenever I had to do a lot of walking. They were all of that. If you need some good socks, buy a couple packs of these. And again, I've had these for 5 months of daily use, and no holes!
B00171NCRO|4|I wore this for an office Halloween costume contest. I work at a call center, taking calls, occasionally getting up to fax something, but absolutely nothing strenuous or taxing physically. With that in mind here is my review for this dress.....<br /><br />The dress itself is gorgeous! The color, sparkles, etc are all just fabulous! It did come in a nice dress bag but PLEASE take it out of the bag ASAP and hang it up as it is one hot wrinkled MESS right out of the bag and will need a day (or 3) to let the wrinkles hang out. I suggest putting it in the bathroom while you take a shower so the steam will help loosen up those wrinkles a little. I ended up having to spray it with Febreeze Wrinkle Releaser and toss it in the dryer on delicate, low heat for about 5 mins. That really did the trick! But it was kind of risky so proceed at your own risk :)<br /><br />The fit of the dress was perfect. I usually wear a pretty solid size 2, sometimes a size 0, depending on the brand. I got the Small and I'm 5'4&#34; and measure 34-26-36. It was very long but nothing a pair of 4 inch heels couldn't fix :)<br /><br />When I put the dress on at home before work, the &#34;corset&#34; area looked off symmetrically. So I just moved it around a little and figured most people wouldn't notice. (I'll try to post a pic). And when I got to work it was as I thought, no one noticed. I got sooooo many compliments on this dress because seriously, it really is gorgeous. So here I am at work feeling like a princess when rrriiiiipppppppp! What the .......?! Oh no! It's the side seam of my dress ripping open just below my rib cage. This happens about 10 mins before our big showdown costume contest where we have to get in a line and parade around the office for the party poopers that didn't dress up to judge our costumes and pick out the winner. So my wonderful lady coworkers swoop in and attempt to patch me up but the material is a little on the cheap side and has started to fray. We did all we couldwith what little we had and I marched in that parade proudly with my new and improved beautiful BIONIC princess dress with metal staples, paper clips, and a few safety pins holding me together :). Sadly, I didn't win but I understand. They just weren't yet ready for the new futuristic bionic approach to the classic Cinderella!<br /><br />All kidding aside, if you're going to wear this dress to an actual Halloween party, I HIGHLY suggest having the seams reinforced on the sides. If I can have mine repaired, I will get them reinforced and wear it again next year!<br /><br />Hope this helps :)
B00JY3L382|2|It's cute but the sizing is small
B00LPCYY72|4|Dress for great! Came pretty fast as well!
B005I6IXTG|4|I needed this slip because my dress was a little too see through.  It added a layer of needed protection and it is perfect because it can be cut to fit a different lenght.
B001IW0M1G|4|I found this product in best of its quality also the size was perfect to my son. Price was bit higher and that might be because of offshore shipment from USA to Canada.
B009HUGETA|4|Very nice, soft scarf, good for a wrap around or just as a scarf. I did have to return it given a change in my outfit for the evening I was going to wear it, but it is a very nice material.
B00KBOHJEU|5|I love these skirts I got the unicorn, old map moridor, and a purple galaxy skirt. I love the fabric and they fit very well im tiny (5ft around 90 pounds) The old morador map is deffintly low resolution but when I put it on its not very noticible and I love it still.  Then the other two are just great
B001GE15YY|5|WONDERFUL product for the price. We bought this suit for our 8-year old to wear for his First Communion - it was awesome...and the tie was so cool. It is a zipper, which is so much easier to get kids to put on and keep on as opposed to clip-ons or ones that velcro. My son loved his suit - he even was able to wear it to a family wedding, too. So, it was a great price for something that kids will grow out of so quickly. There were a few strings that needed to be trimmed from the seams, but that was no problem. The pants fit in the waist, but be warned the pants come unhemmed. I did know this when ordering, but not much hemming needed to be done...I think that if they are coming unhemmed, they could have been a little longer to begin with.
B000T39NYM|5|I have never had a bra that was so well made and fit so perfectly!<br />Watch the sizes tho. Be sure to measure and use the chart. I had to send the first order back as it was to small.<br />As usual Amazon was quick getting the order to me and the return was no problem at all.
B0032Z1S2E|2|This shorts arn't that great....<br />I was hoping for a better thought out cargo style pair of shorts from dickies...<br />The two front pockets are ridiculously small, no iphone or wallet will fit or feel comfortable in them.<br />The &#34;Multi-Pocket&#34; is a useless side pocket with no button, velcro. or flap to cover it, making it a pocket<br />for something you don't care if it gets lost when it falls out.<br />The cut on the legs makes them way too billowy and too tight in the crotch.<br />I'm trying to imagine what the manikin looked liked they used as a template to design these shorts.<br />Dikies pants are great, but these shorts are a failure on there part.<br /><br />I won't buy them again,<br />or any of dickies shorts,<br />instead i'll stick with dockers who have got the right recipe for making cargo shorts.
B005NEJG0I|5|Bought this jacket for my boyfriend for his birthday. Charlie is his all time favorite Sunny character and we always talk about how much we love his jacket. He loves it! It looks so good on him and the fit is perfect. Definitely buy if your a huge Sunny fan or if your a fan of awesome military jackets. :)
B00HRNIJWE|5|These fit true to size, are incredibly cute and organic.  There isn't much else to say.  I love them!
B00QS8D28A|5|Fits well , great color, and Quick shipping!
B005TK6V6S|4|I like it. I wish the fabric were softer, other than that it meets my needs and expectations. The price was great enough to take the plunge and buy it. Shipping prime. I will use it occasionally and happy to add red to my hat collection.
B00GBW7L6M|3|This jacket runs small is Asian sizes they are much smaller than US sizes . if you want to order you need to order two sizes up more in order to fit yours . However The Costumer service of this Company is excellent . If you have any doubt about your size contact them they are avalaible to assist you with your size . The design ,quality and price are good .
B000KMBGJW|5|These trunks are the best deal I've had in a long time.  I spend 2 hours a day in chlorine water and most suits don't last 3 months.  I've waited 3 months to write this review so I could see how the trunks looked after my test.  They currently are faded a little, but I see no problem with them lasting  over a year.  ed
B00NPUEDSC|5|I love this product , it was what I expected
B00NVWHECQ|4|This jacket is super cute & surprisingly very warm. I ordered a size larger than what I normally would just so I have the room if I were to wear a thicker sweater under it.
B00BWAZ3IQ|2|This shirt would be cute if the size chart was accurate and it fit better.<br />Sleeves where tight on my forearms.
B0010B31UY|5|Is it possible to love undershirts?  Here is a vote in the affirmative.  The shirts are wonderful, and I strongly recommend them.  Other folks might I size issues, but I do not.  These are cotton, but they feel better than silk.
B00E97KE74|2|was just too big for my granddaughter
B005DPC0PU|5|What can I say - It's Ralph Lauren.  Love it!
B005STFQIE|5|This hoodie is great.  It's much better than I expected, excellent quality and incredibly comfortable!  It won't disappoint you!  Definitely happy with my purchase!
B00EHU78S6|5|Just as described.  My daughter loved it!!!  Very vibrant color!
B000J1A032|5|Even though he has on socks, we have wood floors and I am always worrying about him slipping.  So I got to be his secret Santa this year and he was delighted.
B0000DZJMK|5|I have found this top to be very comfortable during my workouts. It fits well and partially covers my hips.  Overall, I think it looks great and I'm very happy with my purchase.
B00MKLG1UU|5|Fits perfectly
B00BEJVK82|5|Nice tank....fits well.....love the length!
B00G49LM1W|1|First of all, they were pink, not red and they were too small for my 11 year old grandson.  I should know better than to order anything from outside the US.  This is the 3rd time I ordered from outside the US and all 3 items were small and not what the picture showed.
B00E4XRMXM|5|Very soft and comfy. Looks good. Warm without being hot.
B00JP5FS0S|2|Very cute but certainly not true to size; runs small.
B000P55140|5|Good buy!
B00HHOXREI|5|This coat is really nice looking in person.... it's more roomy than I thought, but that's great for sweaters
B005GYGEWS|3|The quality of the capris is great and I like the length because a lot of times capris end up being ankle pants on me because I am 5'2. The medium size, however runs larger than most mediums. These were loose on me pretty much all over and I am actually concerned about them slipping down in a yoga class or Zumba. I normally wear a 6-8 in pants. These fit much more like a large.
B002HJ3DNI|5|I hate wearing socks especially with my Uggs - but I have to. These socks stay up and don't leave that ridiculous mark on my leg that I can't stand to see when I take them off to go into yoga. They are soft and wash well. I initially bought one pair in a store and was determined to find more. Love them and Amazon for having them cheaper than the store I finally found them in over Christmas.
B00CF7RPRW|5|Love it
B00E3OW9PI|1|It was way to small for the size
B00IB1MM4C|1|Definitely not true to size. Was really disappointed when I got them and they were skin tight. Not a good purchase, if you buy these get 2 sizes bigger than you normally wear
B00LB9ZI2O|1|so cheap! the cut-outs were only cut out but the fabric was all still there so I had to remove the pieces myself! so annoying! and much smaller than it should have been.
B00A86QF3M|4|The sleeves and length are a little short but it's cute with tights.  I'm 5'3&#34; 168lbs curvy
B004SBMQ1I|5|Is it was all I needed, it was great. The kids on my school just loved it and wanted use it on Hat Day.
B00900ON2M|5|Purchased for my sons to wear at my wedding! Worked great, looked great, and now I can't keep my 5y/o, 8y/o, and 12 y/o out of them!!!
B00J8P7K4C|5|I was unsure about this dress when I ordered it because of the low price but I have to say that everything from the fit to the quality of the fabric is fantastic. The colors are vibrant and I have received many compliments each time I have worn it - it's fast becoming my new favorite go to dress.
B00DW9YXB8|4|not as high up on the waist as I would like but they print is great and they look great on
B00DMXMYNS|5|Elf on the Shelf is such a positive influence. The PJs reinforce that influence long before and after Elf arrives for his annual visit. I would have preferred one size larger so it would last two years, but they were sold out.
B00AHCH6Z8|4|It is the second pair I have purchased.  The first has worn and laundered well. I will buy again if needed
B0036OS6KI|5|For him, that's high praise!  They are just workout shorts after all, not a tuxedo or anything :)  But they are comfortable.  Good pockets. Easy wash. Good fit.  Great Price! What more could you want.
B00K8ED7RQ|5|Great quality
B008MWJJBY|5|Fits nice, looks nice, warm, good inexpensive fleece
B00DY73WBK|5|Great fit, comfortable, and arrived expediently. Could use two more belt loops though.
B00PHECJ1M|4|cool
B00HYU08YM|5|Very beautiful. Very much it was pleasant to the daughter.
B00348FPOQ|5|After reading the reviews I bought these and after a month or so I am happy with them. They are not a heavy fabric but it is a summer shirt so I don't want it too heavy anyway. Someone else thought the pockets were too short but I didn't see they were any shorter than other brand shirts I own. One nit is that the brand and size labels on the collar were an irritant, scratching my neck, so I cut those off. Other than that the shirts are fine and I would buy them again.
B003E2Z5LK|4|the sleeves are really tight
B00P0JQDAW|5|I'm in love. Fits perfect. The material is very thin yet not see through. I love it
B009ESB9DG|5|I just got my shirt today, I'm 5'5 and 120lbs, I ordered a small which is what I wear here in the USA and it fit PERFECTLY. It is kinda see through but I just put a little tank top underneath. I am very happy with this shirt :)
B005LLKFQW|5|Just what I needed for Halloween...fits well.  Appears well constructed
B00A01AWFC|4|It's fine with the flaps down but a little tight with them inside the hat.  Bought for the ear flaps, so will wear the hat when cold enough for the flaps to be worn down.  Otherwise nice hat.
B002MAP5NI|5|Love the hat fits great , like the pocket under cap made well . Very satisfied.
B002L5JP9E|4|Cute costume. We used balloons to fill in the tail and the beak. The tie system to keep up the leggings doesn't work well at all and break if you try to tie them too tight. So, we improvised and used masking tape. Otherwise, great costume.
B00QGBFQ3S|5|100% great
B001R4C920|5|Bought these before and my grandson liked the fit so bought them again for school.
B00KCW9BCY|5|Will be ordering many more shirts from Crazy Dog.
B006WDFZYA|5|Wonderful hat.  Cool, too.  Didn't know about the dark underside--but it does reduce glare.  Love it.
B00KW6LLZ0|1|Had to send them back and couldn't exchange for sale price originally purchased at! Seemed well made
B005E1JGKU|5|Love this suit. I bought it in read, and it's slimming, comfortable, and have not had a problem with \\"dents\\" in my skin. It's really comfortable, and appreciate that the skirt can be lowered or raised.
B009CCRL6I|5|What can I say their warm wool socks that are made in The USA.<br />They are soft,comfortable,and cheap compared to any other socks of the same type. Well worth what they cost.
B008G30ZDU|5|Love!! It is so soft and beautiful!!
B009JLWO64|5|This is a great shirt, however it is on the trimmer fit side, so if you like your shirts to be loose, especially in the arms, or you like wearing a layer under it, I suggest going a size up.  Fits lovely on its own.
B00ET1V60Y|5|I love love these underwear's they are super comfortable soft and fit very well I highly recommend these
B00B1NL9EQ|5|Perfect!!! I love it.  Fits well (I'm 5'4&#34; and 125 lbs) and it still has some open area in the back to illustrate the laces.  I've worn this out with my husband.  It is definitely more revealing but still appropriate for public.
B00RTFULIA|1|The reason why I am giving a 1 start is because I washed it in the laundry after one use (mind you there was no care/washing instruction on the tag) so I decided to wash it in the laundry like I wash all my other bathing suits without any problem. After a single use and a single wash all the seams covering the wire for the cups came loose. It wasn't a small rip which I would be able to stitch and keep using. On both cups the lining covering the wire lost its stitching. Please reference my pictures attached. I will return and not purchase again, it is a shame as the bathing suit was pretty and well fitting.<br /><br />The bathing suit is really pretty and it fits great! I usually wear between a medium and a large, and given the review opted for an XXL and it was really good fitting and super comfortable. I liked the cup lining and the split in the middle.
B00II9DBCE|5|I loved them just the right fit price is great and keeps my legs warm.. I love them
B00MA43T70|4|Great looking tie bar, works with regular and narrow (not skinny) ties. It does sometimes shift a little such that it isn't perfectly straight, but overall I'm really happy with it. I love the clean, streamlined design and the simplicity of the bar attachment (vs. clips).
B000O3GZGG|5|I purchased this for my Sirius Stiletto.  The design is compact and the speakers aren't too bad for the price.  I like it!
B00BFWAV38|4|I have gotten this for my son who has to do a project about DaVinci. I like the way my son looks like because he looks like DaVinci.<br />I know it is an adult costume so I have to make something else to fit for my son who is still 9 years old. I like it anyway, he will look great for his project.
B008N8121M|5|Just as expected.
B00PXE0QDE|1|It doesn't fit to me
B00OA68DC2|5|Perfect
B00DQSS7KI|4|No complaints, was exactly what was expected, good quality.
B002MXW3PS|5|For the price its really good! its not comparable to the north face headbands, but for the price its unbeatable!
B005EWJUPA|5|I ordered these socks as a gift, and I believe they will be well received.
B00DR19PJ6|4|Works well and looks great.
B00F6JWQMU|3|returned
B009KE5XN6|4|I was looking for a slimfold RFID and decided to give this a try.<br /><br />I'm very happy with it, it seems well made with high quality leather.  I did not test the RFID capability.  A word of warning - it's on the small side.  It's barely wider than paper bills and will only comfortably accommodate a driver's license and maybe 4 credit cards.  If you're needing a George Costanza-style exploding mega-capacity wallet, I'd look elsewhere.
B002XV2CQ4|4|this ski mask is great if you want your head warm, but the eye and mouth holes are a little small for me
B00T85QJCG|4|Beautiful dress, looks absolutely perfect on my youngest daughter, she is 6 and the size 6x fit her great! She mentioned the material is a little scratchy in a few spots, and I am hoping it will soften a little with a couple washes.I am very happy with the look of this adorable dress!
B005F29EXC|4|These jeans have nice, thick material that is the strongest, thickest that I have seen. Very good stitching quality and very heavy duty. But, the inseam rides a bit lower and the seat has a bit more room than I would have liked as well so that makes the inseam a bit long, order an inseam that is two inches shorter and you should be fine.
B008BC70XY|2|I agree with other reviewers that this shirt runs very small.  Normally a 10/12 would fit my son perfectly.  This Medium 10/12 fits more like a 7/8.  Will have to return it and hope the Large is even going to be big enough.
B003BTU6AG|5|Exactly what I wanted.  I used to buy trucker hats with skate company logos back in the day.  This is what I've been looking for but without any logos.
B00E4I4XS4|5|Clouds of sunshine that is
B00U7YX7TK|5|Fit as expected.  Not as sheer as shown in the photo.
B007RWYOWY|3|quality seems high but the sizes were a bit wonky
B00L9ZJWIQ|5|Fits perfectly my daughter loves it
B00JXIK3S4|5|Fell in love with the fit of g star jeans so much so that I purchased 5 pairs within 2 months !!!
B00DW5CZKI|4|Haven't gotten to use them yet since it's winter but they look great and they look like perfect fit for my son.  I am please with the product.
B00IOMNOEA|5|Perfect for dance class
B007N1CX4K|4|I'm  a 36D and the blouse fit perfect love the feel & quality if it. I purchased it for my costume, but I will also wear it for other occasions.
B000UWN7QW|4|My first Carhartt snap front shirt.  It was the snaps that attracted me as I looked for something winter-ish.  As a petite sized woman, I wish Carhartt offered broader petite sized offerings.  But most important the shirt fits well through shoulders and chest and is about hip-length as the photo shows.  For myself, I'll either roll up the sleeves or do some personal tailoring on the sleeves so that the details of the snaps at cuffs are not lost.
B0057M2E8C|5|This pin was so worth buying. I love it very much. It doesn't scratch easily and hasn't fallen off my bag even though I've pulled it across the floor on accident a few times. Perfect for the ultimate whovian! <3
B00FJ0729I|5|This dress was beautiful on screen but it was so much more gorgeous in person. The delivery was earlier than we expected so we were delighted!
B004MKLO3G|5|Comfortable, sleek and light. Definitely plan to purchase another pair. The right color even hides the occasional shart. So a friend tells me. :)
B00RK88DAE|5|Very soft and comfortable.
B007G2SESK|1|They looked pretty good on pictures but then again pictures don't let you know how a product feels. They ride up and are uncomfortable.
B00YLTF3F8|5|Absolutely Adorable!!!
B0092SPCZE|5|Gave two of these as gag gifts for people we tailgate with during the football season.  they loved them!!
B00B2IQLC0|5|It looks great on me. I feel it's a bit tight on butt area. But overall get fit.
B009TBZTZM|5|Very warm. Perfect for cold winter days.
B007WQY92U|5|This is a very nice suit and the price was perfect!! Fits nice and is very comfortable! I would definately buy another Reebok bathing suit.
B001K5IM2M|5|Really great gift. true to size.
B008BOVUNS|5|I had a hard time finding 6 husky jeans for my son but these did the trick.  A little pricey but nice jeans for the money and the FIT.
B00L4FUCQW|1|Bought 12 months size but it hardly fits to 6 mnts baby... Quality is not good, too cheap
B00550Q5QS|5|I wear a DD and I thought my only option for a comfortable, supportive bra was one with wires. THIS bra has changed my mind. I put on this bra for the first time this morning and it's 18 hours later and I'm STILL wearing it. My back doesn't hurt like it can with lack of support from other bras. I didn't have to worry about stretching and accidentally breaking a wire, and end up being stabbed all day. I'm a big time fan of balconet bras but I'm now a big fan of this one too.
B00S2SQCXQ|4|Washed ok I guess but kind of cheap made.
B00804TKPO|5|Cool deal on these shirts. Like the other guy said they are good quality shirts. I will buy more in the future. Nice ones to go on a run in which is why I bought them. Ridiculously fast shipping as well.
B0044QECNM|5|the sweater is beautiful, it looks great in person i bought it for my god son and when i gave it to him it fitted him smaller than expected, i bought an XL (US Size) and it fitted him like a belly button jacket females wear, i ended up taking it for my self and it fitted my perfect and i'm a Large (US Size)
B008JH95J8|5|Awesome delivery, Highly recommend !
B00SDSEOE4|1|DO NOT purchase these shirts! Terrible quality and the seller is a rip off !
B00GAP91IG|5|perfect
B0008EKWCO|4|This bra is great for those with larger cups because it's supportive but it has simple straps that will not impede wearing tank tops.  It runs a little small.  The latch to fasten each side is very easy to use and the bra, itself, is comfortable at a very reasonable price.
B00UECCYSA|1|The shirt came extremely small. Smaller than anyone would think. I ordered this for a friend who wears a 4x only to see that the shirt was as small as a medium. Mind you it was ordered in a  4x. This is false advertising at its bbc finest and I am very disappointed
B00BFDTJNK|2|I wear an Xl or 1 x depending on the top but got a 2 to be safe .. can't even get it past my chest.  Maybe I should have order 3 sizes up to be safe :-(
B00JXNMQOS|5|Love the shirt
B0084QXUE0|4|Label states 91% wool 9% silk. Suit appears to have only a very slight silk quality. Fit required tailoring but that was to be expected<br />Overall a good value.
B000TG940W|4|These are exactly what you expect. They have the right look and the suede-like material on the outside gives them the appearance of being something of higher quality. They have absolutely no support, which is par for the course for costume shoes. If you intend to walk in them for extended periods of time, you will need to do as I did and put some show inserts inside them.<br /><br />I wish there were black pairs, but I just ended up buying a brown second pair to dye instead.
B000VPO7CQ|5|It looks very original in my kids  backpack and they love it. easy to use. No need to be worry with needlework.  Right on time
B000UJDM7E|5|Wonderful shirt......stylish and practical and has a chest pocket!  A must have for my husband.<br />Very satisfied with this item.
B00SVEJE4A|5|So beautiful
B00PLBRT8O|5|Flattering cut, quality seems to be holding up well to washing..I airdry stuff, so did not experience any shrinking of the top.  I liked the style, could also be worn with a camisole underneath if the V neck is too low cut, or you live in a wintery climate and don't need the draft! I've bought several Patty Boutik items and am pleased with them so far!
B00ES83MKK|3|Very cute, needs to be a bit longer. I'm 5'10 and I would like to see more material length wise. When I sit, it shows my back and I don't like wondering if my behind is showing. Other than that I like it.
B00ASPN21Q|5|Adorable on my little girl. I like these jammies because they have shorts and short sleeves, perfect for sleeping so she does not get too hot. Also, she has long legs and most footies are too stretched on her.
B002LFY81O|5|thanks
B006MJL6ZG|5|Perfect addition to a nursing moms wardrobe.
B00KRI8OD0|4|Cute shirt...looked great for my Halloween costume.
B00KSR4010|5|This is a very sexy skirt. I usually wear a medium and there is plenty of room in this. I ordered the white skirt and it is semi-sheer like in the models pic. The material is quite soft and actually a very, very fine ribbed design. I'm 5'8&#34; 145# normally wear medium with skirts. This is quite stretchy even the waist band.
B00HFGJM42|5|Exactly what I was looking for not too bulky for riding in the car but warm enough to play outside.  I've never not been satisfied with the Columbia brand.
B004QMLQYW|5|I read many reviews stating that this shield was cheap plastic, thin and flimsy. was very cautious. Glad I didnt listen. Shield is plastic and does flex slightly. Would probably damage it if you threw it accross the room. Fortunalty for me im just holding it for a costume, and I'm not actualy catching bad guys! Perfect for that. Thick enough. no complaints and it really does complete the costume.Is slightly costly but is to be expected buying something licensed by marvel.
B00HVVVGN6|5|good
B00K061ZVW|4|Great lookin T just a little big.
B006LFJDZQ|5|I get so many compliments on these it's unreal.
B004CJ2RHO|5|My son is 14 months old and these fit great, with a little wiggle room. I don't quite see him fitting into these at 24 months, though. These are my favorite brand in any size as they seem to fall apart less than other brands.
B00510KJVO|2|This might be a good wallet for a girl that's putting it in a purse or backpack, but going in and out of a back pocket will shortly end its use as a chain wallet. I got this wallet on Tuesday and by Sunday, the grommet that holds the chain had ripped out of the &#34;leather&#34; (it's vinyl) and the stitching that holds the wallet together was fraying out.<br /><br />Too bad really. It's really a unique design, which is why I gave it two stars. The quality is substandard however so I could not recommend it unless it's to be used extremely delicately. It is anything but &#34;high quality well made leather&#34; as advertised.<br /><br />I would buy it again in a heartbeat if it was actually made of genuine leather and it had an ID window. Oh well.
B00UK4WQGC|5|These handkerchiefs are absolutely beautiful! The embroidery is very well done, especially around the scalloped edges. I was very pleasantly surprised by the quality of the fabric – they’re not the mushy, flimsy kind that I was afraid of getting at first. They hold together well after being washed too. I’ve gotten lots of compliments on them.
B009UQQRC0|5|Its a great looking belt but it's a little bit wider than the similar guatemalan belt I got from Columbia.
B004CTP5VY|1|These are knock off spandex/cotton briefs, do not buy
B000TA8LJ8|2|stretched out
B00V64KX3I|2|Too small, had to return it. And I wasn't paid the full amount for the return postage I paid.
B000UPVCPW|5|My wife loved it
B00GXMFNUQ|1|HORRIBLE!!! the teeth on the side stick out and look ridiculous not too mention if you do not have HUGE boobs and a tiny waste this does not fit like the picture shows AT ALL!
B005F2AS1E|5|These are super comfortable, but not opaque. I was hoping to wear them under a costume to prevent any accidental flashing. However, they don't offer enough opaque coverage. Great for lounging on a Sunday morning though!
B005PY6S7K|5|I think saying &#34;no bounce&#34; is a bit of an oversight. I think for large busted gals we'll most likely always have some bounce but I find this bra keeps mine at a minimum. I would advise using their website to order rather than Amazon. There are a few different styles and I found that one style was far better and more comfortable for me than the other. I am able to run, and do high-impact and HIIT activities in the Racerback rather than the Cross Back (which was a nightmare for me). I would definitely recommend this bra in the Racerback.
B0007QMKKA|3|I ordered this because it appeared to be the closest to the Warner brief Model 371, small that I've had and enjoyed for many years and seems to be no longer available.  The Maidenform is heavier and tighter and still usable  for non-eating occasions.
B00008YMEM|5|I don't often review clothing, but these pants are just the cutest. Very flattering, nice cut, nice fabric. Also, very slimming. They are suitable for casual wear or going out in, if denim is not too inappropriate. The legs are nice and long, made for medium-to-tallish women; petites will have to wear high heels with them or hem them.  Other than that, they're a great bargain, and look great. Nicest jeans I've ever found at Target.
B008TZWRJ0|5|Grest
B005WUH8Z8|5|I don't really have 20 words to say about this shirt except its well made, bright and has long sleeves like I wanted. Haven't tried it on, haven't worn it, haven't washed it yet and washing will be the true test.
B00JY7M2G0|5|Gloves that fit my big hands.
B00769ICZI|4|Lab coat is true to its picture and is a good basic coat for the money.  Only complaint is the length of the sleeves which are proportionately somewhat short.  Overall I do recommend this lab coat.
B00KVC9K2G|5|Beautifully made. Fits as expected and very well made.
B0083QLQ10|5|This was a great buy. I now have one of these for each day of the week, and I just leave them attached to my bras when I wash them! So glad I didn't have to buy all new bras!
B001H1PYD4|4|I read all of the reviews beforehand stating that of all the other maternity bras, this one was the most comfortable, but it tended to run small. I was told for a 36b, I needed to order a large rather than a medium. I did and yet it was still pretty tight. However, when I take it off I realize all that it is doing for me.<br /><br />It is growing with me, I'm forgetting that I have it on at times even though it does climb up in the front and back as if it was made for someone with a much shorter torso, but when I take it off all of the soreness that was missing comes back full force. I'm really glad I had it but wished I had ordered one more size up so it wasn't so tight.
B00SIWSWXE|5|so  handsome
B009WS5S0S|5|I love this scarf! It jazzes up a solid color top nicely.
B005CSOLKK|5|I really like these Champions sweatshirts. The fit is perfect. They wash well without shrinkage or fading and they are warm. Very well made.  These are the best sweatshirts I have purchased in over 20 years.  Buy these with confidence.
B00GSVSVG0|5|great fit
B00V0JF7LC|5|love it
B005A8CYCO|5|Very please with this item. Added an extra touch to my attire and our black history program we had at church.
B00HD5IV0Q|5|Warmer than I thought it would be! I wish the colors were less vibrant, the pic makes it look more muted but WHATEVS this shirt rules.
B0048KZGZM|5|my 4 yr old loves dress up shoes and so far they have held up to her stomping around in them.
B004L3471A|5|I bought this for my Daughter who's gonna have her First Communion this May. She's 7yrs old and since most of the reviewer said runs large I ordered this in size 7 her true size. It perfectly fits her. Need to buy a petticoat to look more like the one in picture though.
B00APUNZ5W|5|My husband loved this outfit. Highly recommended.
B003WM1LME|4|Son liked it. Has worn and washed over and over, decal still good  has not faded at all
B00B2FTJ72|3|I am so surprised by this....I ordered a pair of the yellow in size 9 and thought they were really comfy and cute at such a great price....So I ordered another pair in blue size 9 as well.  I wore the blue ones today and thought to myself these feel bigger than the other ones, I thought maybe they were stretching out from wear, I had to keep pulling them up after awhile...so when I got home I held them up to the yellow ones (also supposedly size 9)I measured them and they are an inch in a half wider at the waist and even tho the tag said 9 I found a lil white square sticker on the inside that had the number 10 on it....So you are taking a chance at ordering INACCURATE SIZED SHORTS!  Will try to shrink with dryer if it doesn't help perhaps they will come in handy if I gain any extra pounds.  :(
B00FBD2G2Q|1|Bad quality of socks!! 😒😒
B007W00MK4|5|they are soft and fit nicely
B007TIRAAO|4|Very nice pant but order two sizes larger than you normally wear. The color is true to the picture on screen. The have a nice, light feel and hang well. The length is longer than described. I ordered a 30 and these are more like a 31. Kenneth Cole Reaction online has a very inconsistent sizing pattern. You'll get an awesome deal but you may not want to order if you need immediately. There is some trial and error and usually you'll take full advantage of the free returns/exchanges. Considering Kenneth Cole are expensive pants, usually around $100.00, it's worth the extra effort for me.
B00I8XZNFS|3|Didn't seem very true to size but other than that a nice hat.
B0017QNADU|5|Love fits great looks great.
B00IOLFAA2|5|Adorable!!
B004XOS3JE|5|Has great coverage, support, and minimizer does help!  The price of the product is something to love as well.  Try it!
B00AW83K2U|5|THIS FITS TRUE TO SIZE!<br />Most overseas clothing runs small, this is just a little big. It's great. I usually wear a Large to Extra Large and this fits perfect. The material is a lightweight knit. It's not a see though material. It feels nice and soft. The seams are good. The sleeve length is great! It covers my wrists the way I like it. Many blouse run short on the sleeves and hem- Nope not here. The hem is long, It's a little shorter than the pic and that suits me better. The style and color match the pic very good.<br /><br />I have been very happy with the blouses I've bought from Allegra. I've purchased several and I'm happy with them and their products. I will be buying more from them. It really helps they've adjusted their sizing to American sizing, less guessing involved.<br />I highly recommend this blouse and this seller.
B00EK9LQHI|3|They are very warm and soft but the fingertips only worked on my iPhone for the first week. I continue to wear them, but wish they worked.
B00DZPAEG2|5|Just as other reviewers noted the bra runs small.  But order a larger size and you are set for a comfortable all day experience.  the wide band is great.  You can step into it and not struggle over your head
B00J5USDAK|1|This product is super cute. I bought it for my daughter's cheer team to put on their bags. Less than five minutes of putting it on the bag, it broke. Needless to say, I didn't even bother to pass them out.
B0055N6SQC|3|I like the jacket. But although the packaging said it was an XL, the label was an XXL. Description of product was accurate.
B005FOSA1M|4|Love this product. It does run a bit small so order a size up. It does roll down a little around my waste when I sit down but not too bad. I now own three of these !!
B00I1D7088|5|Love these socks.
B00KLFWQQA|4|Great jeans just a bit to big on me compared to some Carhartt my wife got me that were the same size.
B002Q6RKCW|5|These are really cute.  They were a gift and my niece loved them. Great socks for the unicorn lover.  Would buy again.
B003H06ROI|4|I bought these pants for jogging in the winter.  I think that they should work well.  They are very comfortable and the material is not overly clingy.  I ordered a medium and they fit just fine (I wear an 8 in women's pants).
B00JVWPAQC|4|Shipped fast, love the inside fleece. Just don't agree that one size fits all. I struggle to pull them up. I will buy again but, with a size .
B008RYBQ7W|4|First time buying a coat online. Got it, took it out of the box, and wore it later that day.<br /><br />Coat fit as expected and looks great. Value to me is that I didn't have to drive to a store and paw through racks of coats to find the style and size that I wanted. Warm, good looking coat delivered right to me.<br /><br />This is a classic black wool winter coat and I recommend it. Fine for business wear or casual wear. It is a men's coat but fits women (if you know what size you take in men's coats just order that). Men's coats are a great value - often offering far more for the money then coats marketed for women. This coat looks great on women too!
B00GRX7QYW|5|I need to buy more. I love it.
B00C0PG95S|4|a nickelodeon product, quality isn't bad.
B00IN4BCCU|3|This swimming suit is cute but the quality of the fabric is bad.
B003ZKTI1Y|4|I love this tie!! It wears well and matches a lot of shirts! People get a kick out of it too! I guess I didn't expect it to be this skinny but then again it was my first \\"skinny\\" tie purchase and I consider it a success!!
B00J21VC1Y|3|I could just barely button these shorts, and I have 36&#34; hips.
B009CQSN70|1|These run really small.
B00IQG87AU|5|Very nice buy. Fits perfect.
B00A67SPF4|4|We love this line of clothing. These pants were just a tiny bit small (4 star rating vs 5) Very wearable still.  They are size small but my petite 6 yo is not going to get much wear out of them. Worth the 10$ for the glittery star regardless!!
B008BDRQZU|5|This belt fits me just right and it looks good with my jeans and denim shorts. It has a sturdy feel to it so it should last for a long time. Cool belt.
B00TWXPSSU|3|Says heavyweight but pretty thin and not as soft as would like.
B004S001Z2|4|Pretty and soft material, may cut out the top and make it cupless as I don't find the support to be enough and makes the top portion look very small
B004NEK338|5|The assorted skull caps will be exactly as pictured.  They ARE made in china, but they are well made.  These are all cotton, not very thick, but does the job that they are intended for.  Some of them might fit tighter than others, but all-in-all they are an excellent buy for the price.
B00C17BHUC|3|Like the Dupont Coolmax T-shirts much better.  This fit smaller than expected.  If you like a tight under armor type T- this one might appeal for someone else.  I like a comfortable t-shirt.  Not too big and not too small.
B00LHU2ZZ0|4|A little thinner than expected,  but nice socks
B007EBVPOS|5|Love it! Wonderful gift from my Wife!
B008PLLD4I|1|My daughter can´t use the pant. It´s too small.I will never bought anything of this brand<br />I bought 4 pants, and she can´t use them.<br />Ths size are wrong, don´t correspond to the age of the child
B000I2MFEE|5|The coat is very nice looking. The price seemed a bargain and I feel quite pleased with the purchase.
B005ZMAZHG|5|I have a TNG Uniform and I got this and the pips in order to have it be real.I love it
B00TIPP0IK|4|It does ride up my daughter's bottom when walking, but fits.
B00E0ER924|1|I order many pieces form it and all of them was too large than what you write it in the size chart .<br /> and the ceramic is not sturdy or high quality.
B00FMNGH2U|4|This dress was nice; however, it just seemed too light and flimsy.  Also, the zipper on the back constantly got stuck going up and down.  Not quite what I was expecting from Adrianna Papell - it was returned.
B00IPKFN22|5|Very nice tuxido shirt
B00FB6K9V8|4|Great shorts
B00N731VIC|5|I love the color and the weight of the material of this top. The color is rich and deep. The weight should be perfect for international travel
B00IM7LWS2|5|Fits perfect and super soft
B00SAV3ST6|5|cheap
B00MV8NM9A|5|I like it tho
B00B2JRW68|5|Bought this for my niece a month or so ago and this has become a favourite of hers. She loves the design, but most of all finds it comfortable. It's tropical weather in where we live and the dress is just nice for that.
B00EZDN2E4|5|Love this clothing line. Such a great idea. Got mine for less at [...] So soft on my babys skin. :)
B00L4KHLIO|5|This robe is absolutely breathtaking. My daughter is getting married and wanted a pretty robe to wear while preparing her hair and make up for the wedding. This was exactly what she was looking for.
B00OGZUCRG|5|loved it so much I had to order the other color!
B00R7EIM9I|4|Love it! The shoulder areas is a bit odd. I have to wear a shirt under. Shoulders billow and look oddly like the ones on paper hospital gowns!<br /><br />But lover the blue flower pattern and soft fabric. Always get complements.
B008775JQS|4|The stockings fit quite well, and they stay up so far.  As I have worn them only three times since receiving them, I certainly hope they will do their job and stay up.  The elastic feels comfortable enough and the quality seems acceptable. My concern is that the sizing information is quite confusing especially for buyers from outside USA.  The sizing chart was not helpful. I took a guess and bought size B for my height of only 4' 7&#34; which is NOT in accordance with the chart.  The main thing for me is that the size I bought fit me!
B000YT4IKK|5|People for some reason don't know what this is. Personally, it makes me happy because they don't and I do. I love this shirt. The batteries are a little annoying but you can just wear another shirt under it (or a bra) and you won't even notice them.I bought one for my boyfriend, and he loves it. After all, who wants to go through the annoying process of turning on a computer to find a wi-fi network?
B008F1IDYG|5|Cute. Fits as expected. Nice layer over a tank or tee because its not thick. It is a quick way to dress up some black pants, white tee or tank with some funky jewelry or something dressier for a dressier occasion. Would order again.
B00BK4DG0Q|1|Lousy quality and very small! If you normally wear a large tshirt you better get a 2XL or you'll be returning item as I did and it was a hassle! Seller was difficult. would not buy from again! For their pricing this shirt is horrible quality & material is VERY THIN!
B007JEK096|3|The color and fit of the wig were perfect for the character I was cosplaying at Otakon.  The wig was much thinner than expected with extremely short 1-2 inch layers underneath the outer full length layers.  If you need to pull the ig into a ponytail, these short sections make it VERY difficult.  In order to get the ponytail look I needed, I had to cut lengths off of the wig and make a makeshift wig clip.  Otherwise, my wig wouldn't have been able to get the look of a half up, half down style.
B00LAN1CJE|2|It's fits but the bathing suit itself is harried.
B00IFGZKU6|4|I'm 5'5\\" 110lbs 32D and have a pretty small frame.  I ordered the smallest size and its quite long and large around the bust.
B000MNHKLC|4|Both the T-shirt and mug are as shown. The inside of the mug matches the green on the T-shirt. The shirt is what I would call a nice quality T-shirt. Not soft and silky like \\"LIFE IS GOOD\\" shirts but, it doesn't feel cheap like some. The only thing you might not like is that the image has a rubber-like feel to it which can be hot in summer. I've washed it once and run it through the dryer inside out with no problem. I'll have to see how it wears over time. My main reason for knocking off a star is that it does not come in the Take Out Box pictured and that could be what you want if it is a gift. If you read carefully it says OPTIONAL but there isn't an option for it on the page. So if you want to pack it in a takeout box you'll have to talk your favorite Chinese restuarant out of one instead.
B00DTHI044|4|The color is great. But the size is small, I ordered a size up and it just fit.  besides, It is not soft enough to baby i think.
B004XG21BS|5|Little loose but not to loose. Still stay on fairly well and very very comfortable.
B00CBO6JRG|3|This is a little kids set- but the headband is for larger and the tail for toddlers.
B00075ZWR4|5|I like these shirts, they keep me cool when doing long workouts, they don't have a tag, wash well and of course... they make me look like a stud muffin....check out these guns... *flexes muscles*
B0013FZYM0|5|Awesome. Sexy and comfortable.
B00GS16LJY|5|Loved it. It is exactly what I ordered.
B00JENKF3G|5|Awesomeness in a belt and buckle combination!  Love how quick it can be adjusted.  Buckle is heavy duty and works flawless.  Belt is mid- weight but should do the job.
B00P81DZ3A|4|Fits my 6 year old even after gong thru the wash
B000H7134I|5|Great pair of jeans. They are sized a little long. I normally wear a 34 but with these 32 is long enough.
B00HDA2WJW|5|Absolutely precious!  My mother-in-law thought this was a cat though... lol I knew what it was at least! The hat kinda swam on my baby's head as newborn, but so did the hospital hat (she was a bit early)!  The gloves certainly won't fit to 6 months and unless your child is small neither will the hat!  The hat fold is pretty much held up with some iron in hem, it comes unglued very easily, but I ended up putting in a couple of stitches to take care of that.
B0067VMXMY|3|Wow so misleading, my baby is 5months n I bought a large according to the reviews and the size chart n it was way too big...had to stuff, it's super cute...but they need to figure out the sizing much better. So many reviews and they have figured it out yet. But I guess it's the brand cause they have this problem with the suits too, had to do major adjustments for my baby regardless of the fact that I went according it their size. It's risky to buy but they are cute. Lauren Madison needs to figure their sizing.
B00470TS9I|5|The color is a little deeper than it appeared on my monitor, purchased this to go with my camel hair coat. Very pretty and very inexpensive, soft next to my skin.
B00E0ERBCW|4|The only thing I would note is they are a bit short but that could be due to me ordering the wrong size for my tall child.  He likes them and says they are very comfortable.
B00475V88W|5|These gloves do exactly as they should.
B00UM4EYQ0|5|really soft stretchy fabric.  not as tight as shapewear but tight enough to hide some flaws.  Love them.
B00JLQL1Q6|5|I purchased the 3-6 month bonnet when my daughter was 6 weeks old. It fit wonderfully from the time we received it, and at 5 months old now, she is ready to move up to the next size.
B005C9GIWS|1|I ordered these several months ago and then recently ordered them again, but they have changed. I loved the fit of the first set I received, but these are different style and they are not the same fit :-(
B00N6USLKM|5|Perfect! Hides the few extra lbs we all tend to put on during the holidays. :)
B004BWXZ6E|1|This dress is beautifully made but the size is nothing like it say.<br />I ordered a five x and it was more like an 2.. I was very disappointment
B01002N9AK|4|Fits great. I got them so I'd have comfy bras while traveling and have recently been wearing them to just lounge around. 34B, XS clothing and the S set fits well. I wish though that I could have ordered black and gray rather than black and white. The white bra is not very versatile.
B00EVH7Q3W|5|Great hoodie for the price. Light weight with fleece inside. Nice to ward off that early morning or evening chill. Will be getting another one.
B00ADX8IHQ|5|I love this turban!  The sequins and style make it dressy enough for work and I have received countless compliments on it! I'm buying another one in black...
B00H3LHGBU|5|Just what I expected.
B002WXHXT4|1|I purchased this same hat a year ago and absolutely loved it, but after it took an intense beating in lots of whitewater I decided to replace it.  I ordered the exact same one again, but the one that arrived was NOT the same hat, more of a cheap imitation, different pattern and different strap than pictured, and much too small to fit.  When I went to return it I was informed that I would have to pay return shipping and I would not be refunded on the shipping I paid.  The hat in the picture is an awesome hat, the one they send is worthless.
B003HC92JI|5|Great, long lasting socks.  Don't stretch out like most brands.
B00553XI9C|5|I felt it gave good support and I wasn't leaking out.
B001H0F3AO|3|I have the same medium sized shirt in navy blue that I bought from another department store and it fit perfectly. However this white shirt, at the same size from this seller, ran MUCH smaller. I can still wear it, but it's still a tight fit. Sizing is dependent on where it was manufactured. Most of the shirts from this seller are made in Jordan, the one that fits me well is made in Haiti. I bought another shirt in slate gray from Amazon in large, and that one was too big (also made in Jordan).
B006PDL31G|5|Good bathing suit, a tad smaller than expected
B006RBEC5U|4|Very good
B00CIYFR2C|2|The tummy control rolls down my stomach. And I hate that...
B001SYRSDE|4|flimsier than expected but fit real good
B00H8VFPOA|5|I was hesitant to order a bra through Amazon just because I wouldn't be able to try it on.  The bra fit like all my other Wacoal bras.
B00M0EOUU0|4|I liked alot
B005N3UB8A|5|My &#34;go to&#34; baby shower item. Always a hit with moms to be and always high quality. We live the ones we got too.
B002TK5FH2|5|It has a very classy lined pattern and solid black color. I prefer stretch fit as I do have a big noggin and this type of hat makes it less noticeable. I'm afraid to wash it and chance screwing it up so I'm washing my red one first haha.
B00J8O5R2K|5|This belt worked perfectly. Could hold 1200 euros. Folded two hundreds together in half then in thirds. Held six of those.
B00BS25ASQ|3|I loved the bathing suit. I got a small because at the bottom of the page said that the swim suit was from a womens department. When it arrived to my house the bottoms were too big but the top fit great
B00AHOQB8O|5|Good
B007C3ZJ0O|5|very  good sleep wear..soft,feel great and will hold up<br />with lots of wear...you will like the product.thanks!<br />your baby boy will jump up and down with joy.I did.rock and roll.
B0032YZMIG|5|Great Shorts, just ordered wrong size.
B00JSJHQP6|5|I was looking for a simple money clip that I could use to keep cash/ID together in a handbag that wasn't large enough for a traditional wallet. This clip was perfect! It was delivered in a very timely manner and was nicer in person than online. The metal isn't thin or cheap, it felt more quality than I was expecting at this price. The clamp is rather strong but not so strong that it tears bills going in or out. Overall this is a great no nonsense clip, great value.
B00CMODPCW|5|excellent...
B0008EOBEY|5|Thank you
B009T5ZV7E|5|I was pleasently surprised when these shorts came in. Very inexpensive and had some nice features. They are slim fit, so keep that in mind, but with that said I am a athletic built and these still fit me fine. One of the nice features is the have a grip band on the inside of the waist to help keep your shirt tucked in. They also have slots on the side where you can put tees. Overall very satisfied!
B00KWHI8GO|5|&#34;HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! The seller is the most honest and courteous person I've ever dealt with. These socks wear extremely well not to mention how great they look! Colors are bold and designs are sharp. From the most comfortable socks I've worn. They even wash well, come out looking brand new! Would definitely buy again and recommend to anyone! Thanks&#34;
B00FWMTU8Y|4|material feels good, shipping was fast, nice price will be purchasing more very soon
B00GTB0RYS|4|First one I ordered was to big . Ordered a smaller size and it fits PERFECT !
B00OPYPBX8|4|Its ok for purposes
B008S49BFA|4|the color is a bit off, has a different print than what's listed. The one I recieved was cute but would have rathered the one on the website. Otherwise the length and material is good.
B00F9NP60M|4|The quality of the corset was fantastic; however, the sizing is misleading to say the least. I ended up giving it to a friend who is significantly smaller than me, and it fit her perfectly.
B00NDF3OD4|5|I hemmed these substantially- but he will have a nice pair of dressy pants for those special occasions for years to come( unless he gains weight around the waist)
B00D8QM7DQ|5|I bought these for my husband as a gift. He LOVES them! They look great and I know they will last him a long time!
B00T2RQH5O|5|Just wondering is it real leather
B00EK9LQHI|5|Keeps you nice and warm.
B007XH8UXC|5|I loved the footless liquid wet look shiny stretch leggings.  This is the second pair of leggings that I have ordered off Amazon.com.  I love them I love bright colors to wear and I can't wait to wear them out.
B00871LAOO|5|It's amazing, my man loved it! It's heavy and a decent size! I highly reccomend purchasing, it's a great gift!
B005CSNVJM|5|Champion is an awesome company. 1. Quality 2. Price 3. Eco friendly<br /><br />I love this hoodie that is all I have to say... wish my gf would give it back tho. LOL
B00LNH364Q|4|I loved it but I should have got the medium size
B004OZEFTY|5|Fits perfect! Cant wait to wear it!
B001GLNEZA|1|THIS ITEM IS NOT REAL LEATHER. IT RIPPED AFTER 3 DAYS OF WEARING IT AND I WAS ABLE TO ACTUALLY RIP THE REST OF IT IN HALF AND I'M A FEMALE. SELLER DID ISSUE ME A FULL REFUND WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED BUT I BELIEVE ITS BECAUSE THEY KNOW WHAT THEY SELL!!!
B009XDJKGA|5|Love the colour and the fit, they really accentuate my arms and shoulders, they are long enough and with the ribbed fabric a little body hugging. Very Sexy !!
B001H0F3AO|5|I previously had one and now bought 4 of these. You can imagine how good these are . They do a perfect job. Wick away the moisture almost immediately. Awesome purchase.
B005LCE9YK|4|I like this bag but ultimately went with the 24 inch version
B00FQ7KNMC|2|This is a gift so I can't yet comment on durability or even if the recipient liked it. However, just wanted to say that it did not arrive with &#34;Free Gift:Tanboo Card and Annagle Lord of the Rings Necklace.&#34; So that part of the description is inaccurate.
B00YZHN5Z6|5|Great Jersey, I ordered a small & it was bigger than I expected but over all love the jersey.
B00CKGB85I|5|This skirt fits perfectly, it's long being 5 feet exact, but if you flip the waist up a notch it works out perfect and it stays and does not roll up.  Plus medium fit perfectly.
B00DD7PAYS|5|This is for my little micro preemie Granddaughter and she looks so adorable in it with the matching head band. It fits her now but good news she is growing so this little outfit will be small for her soon. Love it on her. She is 3lbs 2ozs.<br />It was a good buy and so cute with the butterflies!
B00EMG3WG2|4|Nice fabric. Soft. Very cute.  Love the built-in mitten cuffs.
B00L69AJAA|5|It fit my 11month old baby (who usually fits into 12-18month clothing) a little big but it gives her room to grow so I didn't mind. And, I did buy the 12 month in this brand before and it was too small so I had to send it back. So, I knew this was as good as it was going to get in size. It's very well made and very very cute. It was a great price for the brand. Great buy.
B00C7GL5FY|3|When I first saw this, I absolutely loved this costume! HOWEVER, it's not made for curvey people, but rather just tall, skinny women with not too many curves. My measurements are 36/24/36 and although I ordered the size that matched my measurements, it was still very tight around my hips and ripped while I was out at a Halloween party!! HOW EMBARRASSING!! I had to wear a sweater around my waist for the rest of the night. So be warned, if you are a woman with curves, this is not the costume for you!
B00JSJ309M|5|Styling! Perfect!
B00F3IDC0Y|5|They arrived on time. I'm 5'8&#34; and trouble with length usually, these were a great length, long enough. Haven't wore yet since it's July but so comfy when tried on.
B00P275FK6|2|Did not fit as expected.  Did not like Fabric.
B00MFBNNK6|1|Love the shirt ordered lg...ran to small
B002ZGCDJS|3|Have purchased this make before and been very happy.  This one seems a bit small, but ok---sure not your<br />everyday comfortable bra.  But remember price was a good one.
B000E9ZR6Y|4|Looks very similar to silk, cheap, arrived quickly, good size. It could be a bit longer (I am 6 foot 1), I had to use some double stick tape to stick the tail to the back because it was very short, but for the price one can't be too picky.
B0027VT5Y2|5|We all like it!
B00LAUB8BE|4|I got this last year because and I totally loved it, and I still do! It is super soft, it fits great, and it's so cute! I was just expecting it to look like the last two photos, but still kinda glad it at least looked exactly like the first photo.
B0073E55TW|5|Thank you so very much outfit was awesome used for a school play fit was great shipping was super fast. Thank you again...
B0010B9ESW|5|Lives up to the quality reputation I've heard over the years. Well made, feminine and soft, an item a woman would feel good about having purchased.
B00JWP8KFQ|3|My son needs shorts for his uniform and these looked like they would fit the bill - but the hip pockets are too shallow to hold all the things he needs to carry each day: phone, student ID, schedule, earbuds, memory stick, house keys.  They fall out when he sits down.  Yes, he can use the cargo pocket, but that isn't where he wants to carry everything.  We are returning them.
B00R57HZZE|5|Was amazing! We used it for prom and it defenatly blends well with different hues of purple. Was a little thick though.
B00MZM3Q2K|2|The product actually is really great however the sizing runs really small. I'm 5'6 135 lbs. and usually wear a medium. After looking at their sizing chart I ordered a Large. Which not only was snug but the legs were super short. They are made in a foreign country and it looked liked they shipped from there also. So I am not going to return, I'll just see if they fit one of my shorter friends. Bummer, I really think I would have worn these pants a lot!
B00FJ5JZ4S|2|Sleeves are oversized and to wide at the cuff jacket looks great but not when you wears as the sleeves make it look to large for you
B00C18MB6U|1|I got the petite small. I am 5'2&#34; and about 115 pounds. It fit me pretty well, I didn't feel like I was suffocating or anything. However, about 5 minutes before I left for my christmas party, the zipper split from the bottom all the way up. There was no way to fix it and the zipper was completely broken. I had tried it on many times beforehand and was wearing it for a while before that happened so it angered me a lot that I had to find another dress to wear before leaving. I'm glad it happened at home at least because if it would have split at the party, I would have given everyone a show. Also, even though the dress was very fitting, the sleeves would not stay on my shoulders. They had no grip and kept falling. So all in all, I was completely disappointed with this dress which really sucked because it looked really nice. I do no recommend.
B000IRGNNS|3|The tights are thick and stretchy, perfect for a dance piece, but too much like a plastic bag for daily wear. The sizing of the tights was not accurately described, Max weight is more 90 lbs. rather than the 160 lbs. is says on the package, and forget it if you wear anything but a size S or XS in underpants.   I cut off the end seams, which I expected to have to do since I am quite tall, and I they will look great in my ballet part.
B006D9N2V6|5|I work in a place that is kept very cold and this fleece vest gives me the extra layer to keep me warm.
B00023KMFI|5|Seems a little small the waist for 34's and a little long for 32's.I am big in the rib cage, but not overly so,can't secure top buttons.These are made for a some one with no chest at the tag size of 34.If i order 36 waist 32 long will the length still dragging the ground.I'm sixty years old,in great shape,have ordered clothes many a year.
B00CSM2EG6|4|This nightgown arrived in a timely fashion and was exactly what was described online.  The fabric is soft and the tulle overskirt isn't stiff or crinkly.<br /><br />As for fit: my daughter normally wears a 3T and I bought a 4T in this nightgown not knowing how it would fit.  She's not an abnormally long-limbed or heavy child and the 4T fit small even before I washed it for the first time.  After washing it shrunk at least 2&#34; and the sleeves shrunk to about 3&#34; above her wrists.  We're only wearing it as a nightie and not outside the house, so I'm not too concerned.  But if your on the fence between sizes, go up one or even two sizes from what your kiddo currently wears.
B00363POJK|5|Cute anklet.  Exactly as shown in picture and shipped promptly.  I like the extension links so that it can fit perfectly.
B00JU7798K|3|Very heavy
B00L5YLHOI|5|Very comfortable!
B00OZCFUSG|4|I like them, but even as a US size 8 in pants with fairly small calves, they were falling down my knees. Good quality fabric though, extremely silky soft.
B005H3BDD8|5|I get so many compliments when I wear this in the winter. If u live in a cold state like I do,  then I def recommend this! So warm, and came on time.
B00QSLQ7FC|3|Just what I needed. Thank you very much.
B00C2KJ6RY|5|Nice decorative tie. Looks good!  But only for the right shirt and person. Lol just kidding. Looks great for all. Just needs proper shirt.
B00D840R7G|5|The little one loves these on, so they must be comfy.<br />True to size, and I was worried they'd keep falling off or be hard to put on a squirming toddler, but not a problem.<br />Great protection against stones or slippery surfaces<br />We now have 2 pairs, just in case, you never know what a toddler comes across, muddy terrain comes to mind.
B005W18AJ0|4|Product holds the content effectively. Could not relocate product due to insufficient tracking system.<br />Good product, but not above and beyond expectations.
B003DA5PF4|5|My daughter bought this for a friend at Christmas and she loves it!
B00K2LFQG0|5|A nice quality shirt and brightly colored.
B00I3UJVF4|5|Originally got a set while at the Mall of America.  Almost 2 years, wearing them around the house everyday--one pair broke.  Amazingly well made, I ordered a pair on amazon.
B002YBIWQC|5|The best socks money can buy.
B00245F9E6|5|Amazing comfortable from start of shift to the end, even the long 12-16 hour days, Have them in lots of colors to match my tops
B0037YTGNS|5|I absolutely loved it, but alas, it was too small for my wife and I haven't a mistress to try it on. I was not happy that I was unable to return it because of the size so, when you order be certain you know the right size. Otherwise it is well made and really pretty.<br />.
B000ULSETS|5|Bought for some one else.
B0052BR7BW|5|No Complaints! It came on time and was exactly what I expected. I would recommend this company again! Well done!
B006OHA3EQ|5|My kids love it.....hope that they create new design like in the movie avenger or fantastic 4, cant wait to see it :)
B00UAQ9UU0|5|Great
B009RA1DUA|5|This was the first Wicking Cool products that I ordered, and it as good as said in other reviews. I bought a second and do not plan on ordering any from other makers.
B00BWJ2T16|5|The flexees were very comfortable.  They are not a heavy girdle like some you can buy so they are not going to suck everything in and make you look 20lbs lighter.  But they do provide a smooth sillouette. I wore them under some capri jeans to get the smooth look and they worked great.  Hardly knew I was wearing them.
B00KNTUJ22|5|I really like these pjs.  They are the best priced (at 8.49 for a two pack) and really comfortable and warm.  My daughter is 12 months and most pjs are a little long when they fit her in other places.  She's 82% for weight and 57% for height.  The 12 months size fit her well until right around 12 months. We bought the 24 months but they are still way to long for her. I think they will be perfect around 18 months.  I agree with the other reviewers that the solid color pj is much softer and doesn't pill like the printed one.  However, they are both comfortable and really cute.  I'm a fan.
B00DR72J70|5|So Elegant and versatile. I had bought to attend a Mardi Gras Ball, went with something with more color but kept because I will wear this.  Wonderful fabric and drape!
B006LHMN5G|5|I bought these cause they were the cheapest. They fit as expected (tightly!) and they go to about my mid-thigh. After a couple days they reeked, but I never got swamp-balls thanks to their breathable construction. Nice and soft, no chaffing.
B000H1PFMU|5|I've been buying the &#34;Bali Full-Cut Fit Stretch Cotton Briefs&#34; for years and have no need to try anything else. When it comes to underwear, I want cotton with a touch of spandex. It makes for a really comfortable fit. These don't sit low on the waist or high on the legs... exactly what I want!
B00N2DL3GC|3|Small than I thought. I ordered something else. Still pretty but I need something else
B00Q1EG19I|2|Will request to return
B00OSI9XOE|5|Well made product, fits perfectly. Comfortable to wear all day as opposed to other compression socks. Would recommend to anyone. Very warm.
B0015ZBR5G|4|I purchased this bra to match the underwear I previously purchased. It is a great every day pair. The fit is comfortable to wear all day long.I am a G 36 and this bra is well made. I would definitely purchase again, in fact I ordered the black color recently.
B00CPR45IE|5|This is exactly what i needed. Shipped quickly came exactly as described. High Quality stainless steel collar stays. In all the sizes
B00FQVWF92|5|Great scarf for a woman!
B008BQ4FOC|5|I wear large and accidentally ended up ordering small, but it fits well not very stretch at all, it's kind of loose actually, I can also wear with a denim shirt underneath just like in the picture (pink one). And for some reason lately it's getting cheaper in amazon, I got it for like 17$. I definitely suggest it! The color is more like neon pink (which it says in the description) in picture it's more like candy pink. In the end its a soft and nice sweater. Waiting for the other colors!
B00IZL7HMA|4|It's beautiful but a little large on my sides
B008SGOSJ2|1|Glasses broke right away...cute idea but cheaply made.
B003VHW3KE|5|I don't use any other socks these days when running.
B001SLHDBY|1|I thought I was ordering a bra without the thick padded cups.  I wanted a lighter bra and this isn't it.  Returned.
B003XTC6QG|5|Such a fun dress for such a great price! I was nervous about on-size-fits-all, but I do not regret buying this at all (I am a D cup and many times a dress in my size won't fit me up top).   These dresses can be dressed up with heels, or dressed down with casual flip flops. I purchased more than one pattern/color (okay...I purchased 7!) & some of them arrived somewhat stiff, but once washed they are all soft and so very comfortable. I'm not used to getting so many compliments!
B00RJZX02Y|5|it fits lovely.. It is very sexy to go out in and it feels good.. Only wear it if you want to be looked at because people will look. great material Wash great fits great lovely lovely dress
B00DV5Y0XY|5|Excellent
B00CMQ9KQK|2|Little flimsy. not what I expected.
B00DV0EPRK|5|This dress is absolutely lovely.  It fits great and hides all the flaws that women are so conscious of.  The slip is removable, so you could potentially wear the overlay with any other black slip.  I plan to wear this dress for a New Year's Eve wedding and can't wait to show it off!
B008QL0C6W|2|The pants fit as expected but the material is cheap in quality. Beware this is not jean material.
B00DEZTDCE|5|Finally a great tee shirt with elbow sleeves. Scoop neck is very flattering.material is good quality.<br />Fits snugly without being too tight. Have ordered more.
B00EUKKR18|5|This pijama its absolutely beautiful. too bad that when i recieved my son growed up so fast that i didnt have the chance to put on him. I'm from Venezuela and the shipping company that i used for this.. took for ever to bring it.
B00J057PFE|5|So cute we love this outfit!
B00OZ14RCC|5|It is practical as described on the website, I have ordered many similar body-shapers but never like the quality of fabric but this is perfect, and it looks great even after washing number of times.
B004NSAJRE|5|I had heard of these footless panythose but it wasn't till I had a nice pair of white pants for the Summer that I looked into purchasing them...they are great, fit perfect and I wear them under much more than just white pants.  Smooths everything and I can still wear my open toed sandals; perfect!
B00FOBS5NY|5|Purchased to have a light weight sock to wear with long pants that fit comfortably in a dressier shoe.  The pattern is just a little flair of interest.  Great sock to wear in the winter boots that have a snug fit
B0085WV8UQ|5|Cool, beautiful. Good price, Carters is always very good, very nice, very good material. Always good thank you so juch
B000TA74BY|5|No wrinkled toes, no soaked shoes. They keep everything dry and comfy making for one less distraction and worry when hiking.
B00KHOOYEC|4|It fit perfectly and was well made.
B00EB4VAGY|5|Nice buy for my girlfriend
B00AZTRS9W|5|great shorts
B00DJBOP2G|4|My girlfriend love it.
B005H3BT46|5|Worked great for Halloween. And my son has used it as a hat ever since.
B00DD0CE0I|5|The socks were a great price and excellent fit!  Ordering another set!
B00S1WEMYE|5|Excellent
B0007QMK6Y|5|Did the job!
B00EJ9A4N6|4|I have had this wallet for only a few weeks, but so far it is very nice. It has sufficient card/money space with a large zip coin compartment.I gave it only 4 stars because the outside zipper has a tendency to grab occasionally when zipping closed. I don't have a clue if it works with blocking my cards, because I don't know how to tell if someone has tried to read the card information.
B007N1CUAM|3|The dress was really cute and fit mostly as expected except for the length.  I'm 5'4&#34; so usually things fit on the long side, but this dress barely (I mean barely) covered my behind.  Walking around even a little caused it to ride up and show my cheeks.  I returned it for this reason and bought another style.  It would be cute if you wear opaque leggings or little shorts under it, but it is more like a longish shirt than a dress.
B002G9UERM|4|fits good with a hardhat little loose on the top part very comfortable to wear and also does keep your face and head warm
B000TFBO8S|4|This are showing some signs of wear after a year, a little more than other socks I bought at the same time but less than others. Hence I rate this 4 stars instead of 5. This wear appears to be the result of dryer heat, because it looks like shrinkage and deformity around the calf. The heels and soles are still solid.
B00ADQZGNW|5|Good
B004YT49K0|4|This is a great costume. You have to wear the skirt over the bottom portion of the corset if you want to wear leggings like the picture. The corset is somewhat difficult to hook all the way on your own, but doable. The cups on the corset for the large probably fit a C cup. I am a 36DD and still able to wear it, but not an optimal fit. I do not the like gauntlets or cuffs that came with the costume because they are straight and not fitted.
B000QS1KIM|1|Outfit was cute but was way too small.
B000JHEP8M|5|AA++ heavy jean. Will order again
B0046XRUS2|4|I had bought these for Christmas before for 2 of my nephews and they were a HUGE hit! So when I got another nephew's name for Christmas he told me he wanted one so here I came to get another one.<br /><br />He got frustrated (14 yr old) and broke the end off to get the money :( I was disappointed - these really are a lot of fun usually!
B004HZYFHS|5|We had the Stephen Joseph Robot themed backpack for our 2 year old and wanted to maintain continuity. It's a very good looking raincoat. It's vinyl on the outside light fleece on the inside perfect for layering or as a single piece. It's not the harsh smelling, prone to crack or split vinyl of our youth but clearly a top notch product. I recommend you get this if you're on the fence.
B001IA0KFQ|5|I bought this jacket for my dad for his birthday. He has had carhartt jackets before but never as nice as this one.  The inside was so soft and warm, and I loved the material on the wrists to keep the cold out.  I didn't get a tracking number until the day I got the jacket so I didn't really like not knowing where my package was. I actually had to email them to get the tracking number.  Other than that I thought it was great.  I will order from them again.
B000G3K7EU|5|I bought this tie and two other pink floyd ties from amazon for my dad on his birthday. I am blown away by the quality of it!<br />I have a hard time finding ties due to the fact he's  6 foot 4 inches tall.  I found this tie on amazon and being that he loved pink floyd.. I figured.. short or not, I have to buy this. Much to my suprise, these are the longer ties! fantastic quality in materials and stitching, I was very seriously, shocked at how nice these are.<br /> pink floyd or not, its a nice design.. goes with anything and he's gotten compliments from a wide spectrum of people, old, young, fans or oblibvious to the band.<br /> I'd buy this a thousand times over.<br />the series I bought:<br />[...]
B00L699WA8|5|very good product !!!!!!
B00186R43G|3|Was generously sized but didn't fit snugly the way a rashguard should.  Price was good and no problems with delivery.
B009NRHINS|4|My friends daughter loved this adorable headband and booties.  Grandma's friend wanted to know where I bought it because she had never seen one like it before and wanted the set for her new granddaughter.  This item is well made but does run a little small even though it says it fits up to 9mos. It all depends on how big the baby is and not just on the baby's age.  There were no problems with the packaging and it arrived on time.
B009DNWFD0|1|Totally dissapointed. Received item did not look new, had signs of wear and tear. It was advertised as new product but absolutely did not look like one. I would recommend to read carefully at the description of this product before committing to it. The product had warm fleece lining but did not look like one with good durabililty needed in winter time.
B0030Y18ZE|2|There is no push-up in the cups at all. It should also be an inch longer because it stops above the hip bone and pushes down on any skin/fat in a very unflattering way( I'm 110 lbs )
B007TBMTC0|4|I purchased this and me and my dad love it! We get complimented on it where ever we go. It wasn't difficult to put on
B00HWNO99G|2|I was very disappointed with this top. I ordered an XL and didn't even try it on. It looked like a size Small so i gave it to my daughter.
B00DZG544S|5|Absolutely comfortable.  It's a bit roomy which is just want I want when sleeping.  Soft?  Oh yes.  Clearly going to be my favorite gown!
B00DY7XAZ8|5|These socks are adorable and perfect for the holiday season!
B0015PKB08|3|I wear size 9 or 10 and these were way too big on me. The heel part was above by ankle!
B00GT49FOS|5|Nice weight for indoor wear.
B00FQVK8XC|3|The scarf is ok.  The material is thinner than I expected.  I would not any more of them.  Really not for me.
B00A7QMTLU|5|I was outside shoveling snow for 3 hours, this outfit will keep your face, neck and head warm.<br />You can't beat the price.
B00DW7I0KK|3|Love but i need smaller dize csn i return fir smaller size
B00AWB3JLE|5|I love it, the fit is perfect.
B00Q43CL3G|1|This two piece bodycon should be beige and blue,, I received white and Blue, and I bout to seehowbeiged looked on me, anyways,,, I will never wear this bodycon
B001C4RSWG|3|I was a little disappointed in the boa.  when I took it out of the package there were feathers all over my floor... every time I picked it up, more fell off... hope it isn't bare by the time I use it .... ;(
B004HFRFC0|5|Love the cut, weight and feel of this shirt.  My only wishes are that it would be made from organic cotton and available in more colors and patterns.
B005WSXQ1K|4|Nice shirt but to large. Size chart was not correct so I returned this product and asked for a smaller size
B008727YHK|4|Cute idea. My daughter was warm. The only drawbacks included the tail and the hood. The tail kept falling off and just dangled limply. We ended up pinning it. The hood kept coming off as well. So, some sort of fastener or attaching it too the dress would help. Otherwise, it was really cute and my daughter loved it!
B00K5VWL3I|3|These run a bit small!
B00RKY5WAC|5|I love this hat!!!  Awesome display of Batman Beyond symbol.  I actually have two of these, decided to get a  spare one -- just in case.
B00H7IA9DQ|5|Great fit
B0007YXURY|5|Was just what I wanted
B00A7QUD6I|5|My husband loves these and they look and fit great under a tailored slim fit dress shirt. The cotton is soft and flexible and comes out free of wrinkles if removed promptly.
B003DHSE7S|5|My daughter's motherinlaw just absolutely adored this scarf.  Said the best thing is how soft it is.  With prime shipping I recieved it in two days.  It was a wonderful deal.
B00WXNU2VY|5|I love this dress. Its very well made and well worth the money.  I have received a ton of compliments.  My girlfriend saw me in it at a car show and demand I wear it to her wedding. It says its a USA14/UK 18 and I typically wear a 12/14. Im a 38B/35/42. I hope that helps you.  Must have the crinoline under it for it to fill out. Beautiful bright colors.
B00KVE1266|1|Although I like the design this product arrived ripped in the crotch area so I was unable to even wear them once I suggest checking quality before sending a product
B00GMO6ZZC|4|Too thin
B004S7ERPK|4|I bought this shirt for the style shown in the picture and when I received the shirt was exactly equal, beautiful shirt, good quality and comfortable material.<br /><br />Arrive on time
B00BLVB7UO|5|These undies are very comfy and fit really well.  If I find more of these in different Avenger characters, I'll get more.
B0081IOREI|5|loved it great quality
B00CU8CGSO|5|Very pretty dressed loved it for my daughter
B007JX6OVA|2|These pants are too long and too wide.  Normally XL fits me quite well, but not this XL. Too bad because I like the waist tie not being a continuous loop like so many sweat pants now use.
B00SM6434S|5|Fits great. Great product. Love it.
B002F59RCU|5|I researched prior reviews before I bought this.  GOOD CHOICE!  It's a very professional suit with all the accessories, full, lush beard and hair, high-quality velour red material....I was very happy with this, as were my grandkids when they saw Santa decked to the nines!!!
B00HG7FDLQ|5|So cute! We got tons of compliments!
B00MXWZHNS|4|I ran a little small
B00HAIE1N2|1|Let me first start out by saying if you like super baggy clothes and are 6'9&#34; tall and weigh 140 lbs the medium will fit you perfectly how ever if your slightly shorter than that then buy something else.  This product is not only terrible the customer service was atrocious the first run I had was when I was simply inquiring as to why it was going to take over a month too ship these and when they responded promptly I was very pleased and told them I would forsure mark there fast response in a review only too be told that I could do what I wanted and if I wanted the item sooner I should have ordered them sooner ( I don't think they understood I was actually being serious that I was happy) I work in customer<br />Service and would never dream of being a smart *** like that the next run I had was worse when I received this item it was rediculously mis sized so I tried too return it and they were going too charge me upwards of $125.00 USD too return it uhh are you crazy haha so when I asked if there was anything else<br />We could do about this they simply said we don't cover returns for unwanted items and ended with Regards hahaha the worst company in the world so please please do me the favor of not buying a thing from this awful place customer service is becoming a lost commodity and the only way we can get it back is by putting company's like this out of business by not buying there product thanks for reading<br /><br />-One horribly dissatisfied customer
B00EMG3WIA|4|Too small for my baby's head, but she had a big head. Cute though!
B000WB386K|4|I've had mine now for several months and taken it on a couple of international trips for work. It's a great bag to carry while playing tourist, shopping, or light hiking.  Room for plenty of gear, camera, sunglasses, pens, leatherman, ID's and other stuff.  I use this bag every day.    My sole criticism is that there is no handle for carrying the bag.  I may have one sewn on.
B00SZ8HX6S|4|Beautifull
B00BBKGMPU|5|Love the feel and the fit.  Nice for hot days.
B000NO0TDQ|4|This is a comfortable shaper that stays in place and is pretty, silky and slightly supportive.  This one doesn't ride up your legs like the others.  Just slip these on and forget about them!  However, these really didn't shape me as well as some others panties, but still a good buy. I'd give them a try.
B00CVS7OBW|4|for a summer day its lovely
B00KOMD46G|3|I'm normal tees like American apparel I typical wear a standard &#34;large&#34;. But in this case I could have stood to went for an XL. It's just a little too short. When I bend over and what not. So what ever size you normally wear of a size up! Otherwise I love the shirt, screen print is great :)
B002DM02RY|1|This water bottle is awful. The mouth piece doesn't connect to the lid very well. In fact, its just a piece of plastic attached to a hole in the lid. When you tip it up to take a drink, you pour water all over yourself. Better not accidentally knock it over or you will be out of luck. It may be impact resistant but as soon as it gets knocked over you wont have any water left. Just awful.
B00U0GABNK|5|These are very comfortable!
B00CKKW0ZG|4|It's a shirt. It's cheap. It fits a tall skinny guy like most &#34;american cut&#34; clothes don't, so I like it! I'm 6'2&#34; 160 with unusually long arms. I normally buy a 16, 34/35 shirts, which fit me in the neck and arms but i'm swimming in the body. I got the &#34;large&#34;, which was about right in the neck, almost TOO LONG in the arms (first time in my life maybe) and the shoulders and body were fitted without being too tight. Don't buy this shirt if you're more averaged proportion, or if you have a gut. Also don't buy this shirt if you're looking for high quality. This is cheap fabric that probably won't last, but it looks good out of the box.
B00I3RGVKA|5|These are nice soft shirts in fun colors, I really like them.
B007UT60H6|5|I absolutely LOVE these tights and I usually detest tights. They are so comfortable and soft and non-binding. I swear you could wear them for pajamas
B00EN1WS4S|4|excellent care and products at the expected time as well as the just boxes to package size
B000NDCHNW|5|Love the product, but ordered two different sizes because I was in-between size 3 and 4 (size 18) according to the sizing chart. The smaller of the two works and fits perfectly. The larger one is too loose and doesn't hold my pants up and doesn't support my growing belly. I ordered two more of the smaller size and am very happy with the products. Also worth mentioning, the dark colors \\"hide\\" unzipped pants much better then the lighter colors.<br /><br />[...]
B00TXP8IQG|5|Awesome wallet - fits everything I need, while being a solid centimeter thinner than my previous standard sized wallet (a leather bifold with ID display flap).  It does force you to cut down on some of the cards you carry - I cut out various collected business cards and 'buy five get one free cards', but between IDs, credit, debit, healthcare, etc cards, I have plenty of room for the essentials
B00A9S1FSO|1|The green pair of socks got two holes the same day baby wore them right after we put them on
B008JY1IKU|3|The hood doesn't sit well on your head and falls over your eyes, no way to adjust it....
B00AKSCCUI|4|I got exactly what I thought. Ran a half marathon in them and they have held up nicely. Very comfortable.
B00XLQLGTY|5|Made fantastic. Great design. Runs a bit small.
B00LTHZA1W|5|Great sweater, warm, fashionable.  Nice and classy plus it has a penguin on it.
B00D8FJIFW|5|We've used this for a few vacations, including as a carry on for flying. So far it has held up great and has lots of storage.
B00GN73KB0|4|Love the softness, colors, length and fit but it looks like a night shirt more than t-shirt
B006VJOZ0U|4|I loved this dress looks similar to the picture.  If you want it to puff out like on the picture you will have to get a petty coat to go underneath.
B00JPN2EL6|5|Must have for cold weather. I wear it bandit style and I must say, I am warm! This is however my primary use for this product, and cant really help much with other uses. Good Quality product. I have gotten various colors now and own multiple of these.
B006JD9AEE|5|Thank you
B00C43SV2K|5|The mask is beautiful.  Its hat is made out of thick fabric and the bells just give it a perfect touch. it loos a lot better in person.
B008HU964Q|5|Love 7!!!! The best cut ever
B003ZMB0BS|5|T-shirt quality is excellent and soft.... size is true to fit, but as I am a girl, I think I will go with Small instead of Medium, next time. Also, I love the design on it ...... Overall, good product :)
B00FN4BSS6|4|This is a very feminine dress that looks nice in the larger sizes (14).  The extra fabric in front might be a problem for you, but I didn't feel that it made the wearer look bigger than she was.  I liked how the bust looked and also the dress from the back.  The zipper is delicate, you need to take your time with it, but it works fine as long as you are aware.  It's a very nice dress for the price.  The color is also as expected.  You can order with confidence, no surprises here.
B00JC10XCI|1|While attractive enough, I only purchased these because the item is supposed to be 100% cotton.  Tag reads 55% cotton, 45% polyester.  And they feel like polyester!  Just be accurate when listing items, please.
B00B6ED948|5|As usual quality and fit that Dickies is known for.  Would recommend to anyone.
B00NZ48EGK|5|Loved them!
B000F3RPJ6|3|Over all this costume is nothing special. A pair of brown pants and a green vneck shirt, both made to fit over clothes; both made out of a weird fabric. This wig is way to poor, i didn't even want to use it, it was messy and not made we'll. also, the goatee is way to big, but you can fix it by cutting it.
B00CYM1AYC|2|Way too small. Ordered 4x for plus sized lady and barely fit a large sized lady.
B00MCZLS6Q|3|The Mona Lisa socks I purchased were much better. The Kiss doesn't translate too well to textiles.
B009NNN6EW|3|served it's purpose
B00UHALAAM|5|fits perfectly and is super cool, fringe gets slightly tangled sometimes but that was kind of expected, LOVE it!
B008AWZXNE|5|My husband loves these! Comfortable and look good. Thank goodness...he hates to shop...I got him 3 pair:)
B00JKWKEA0|2|Too small for large size I ordered.
B005C9HRC8|4|You gotta have a large head to fit this cap. I ended up having to fold the back up at the nape of the neck so my eyes wouldn't be obstructed by the brim. It's a really cute color and the matching scarf pulls it all together which I love. Maybe my head isn't average size, hmmm. Overall it's a really good product and is cozy and warm.
B00A0K966E|5|This t-shirt is just beautiful. The print is just lovely. I beleive there should be more sizes to choose from. I also need size 3T but there are none available.
B0058LTVGU|3|Pretty cute, sleek corset. Not the best for a small busted girl, unless you plan to wear a strapless bra underneath. You pretty much have to try to hook all of the clasps on the front of the corset at once, not individually, which is a bit of a hassle. I feel like this corset probably won't stand the test of time. However it's still very cute, and would be great to photograph in. Just not as practical to wear or strip out of ;)
B002YQ2FLU|5|I used to work for a Leotard Company and Capezio was our #1 seller. My Capezio tights have lasted for (10) years. They are of the highest quality.
B009B0QEAU|5|I am a woman size 8 (shoe size) and these socks fit so wonderfully! They are really cute, and I absolutely love them! They are thin and comfortable!
B00FH7C5RC|5|Beautiful dress and great for summer! Classy and breezy. Love how it looks on me! I'm 5'3&#34; and the length is near perfect! I just wear some chunky sandals and voila! It also makes me look slimmer and taller.  Get compliments all the time!
B00PKJKTV6|4|I originally bought this only for the eye mask...they seem to be very expensive otherwise. I was impressed with the robe and the socks as well. The sleeping mask is a bit too tight so I would make an adjustment...I don't have a big head either, lol. I would recommend this to others. Wish there were more colors.
B000Z417W6|2|Does not fit a size 16! It is pretty much a size 11-14. My whole costume centered around this dress and now I'm in a scramble to find something else! SO disappointed!! If your small it will be great because it is a Gorgeous costume..Just not for a Plus Size girl who is in a size 16. And there is NO Stretch to this costume. Upset that I was mislead that it was a \\"Plus Size or X-Large\\" Costume. Since I am most definitely a size 16! Upset to say the least since it's 4 days till Halloween!
B00EI4ID8A|3|Not what expected. It is just a scarf.
B00DLLH2VA|4|Nice fit.
B00J9ED7BM|3|This dress would be better if it came in a petite, I'm 5'2&#34; and short waisted and while the fit is good through the waist and hips, the bodice of the dress is too long for my shape. If I keep it, I'll need the shoulders adjusted.
B002C56L86|4|The outfit is great, all pieces are included.  I had not problems with the outfit or the distributer.  I'm very happy.
B00LMGA8IU|5|Good quality shirt
B008GVYWTU|5|Cute - fit well, my daughter LOVED it!
B00505DUAM|5|Worked perfectly
B0058DGHWO|5|Love the way it fits. The elastic waist gives it a nice shape and the lining is really soft. Can't wait to wear it.
B00CD1RC3M|5|Most comfortable bra I've had. Soft and same size as other bras. Amazing!
B00JE1QV22|3|the sides are completely cut out not see through like the pic the dress wasnt expensive so im not waisting money sending back!!
B00B4QOSQQ|5|Mainly I like them because they fit, it's not easy getting a good fit when you are short.  It would help if the manufactures would'nt keep changing the size.  I bought a pair of size 8petite in the store, thy fit perfectly, then I orderd the same size from amazon, they were too large, had to send them back and get a size 6petite.<br />All in all I am very pleased with them.
B00452TGRC|3|Well, at least this C&C California Wrap Dress has SLEEVES!  I'm sure I'm not the only Baby-Boomer woman who is glad to see sleeves on a dress!  Not only do sleeves keep one warmer, but they also hide....er, the slight imperfections that tend to stay on one's arms, (and perhaps the rest of one's body), after a few years.  You know...the results of extra calories?   Luckily, I still have a fairly nice-looking neck -- but some women do develop a rather scrawny looking neck over the years.  Always \\"walking a mile in other people's moccassins\\", I wish this dress came with a high-neckline version as well.  Yes, I know that I would look good in this scoop-neckline dress -- but would so many other women?    The main, (actually, the ONLY), thing I dislike about this dress is it's LENGTH.  The length of this dress is about four inches ABOVE the knee!  In other years, I might say the dress looks like it has shrunk -- but I know it is sadly not the fashion for below-knee skirts or dresses right now. I thope this will change soon!  Some women do NOT, unfortuately, have th prettiest legs, and such a short skir makes the wearer quite cold. (Yes,I know that easily rippable pany-hose can be worn -- but why go to the expense?    The colour is pretty.  But the dress -- with such a very short skirt -- rmminds me of the clothing worn in 1950s science-fiction movie dress.   Or -- a leotard, with a skirt thrown over it. This might be considered a \\"sexy dress\\" by some -- but how attractive is it when one sits down, and one's underwear shows out?  In my book, embarrassment is not alluring, and the danger of having one's underwear in danger of showing out if one sits, is not attractive.  A little mystery, OK, C & C?  And please...make it in larger sizes?    I hope skirts will be made longer, and soon -- so that EVERY woman vcan buy pretty clothes that suit her! As things stand now, many women -- of whatever age or income group -- simply CANNOT find clothing they can be proud of, that is alsoclothing that fits!  If clothing manufacturers are producing mainly sleevless, very short-skirted dresses today, (to save money on material, perhaps?), they will soon find that falling sales will, in the long run, produce lesser profits.      It really is too bad.  I do like those sleeves, (SO much) --- and the neckline -- but wish that the skirt length didn't remind me of a cheer-leading outfit!
B006ZS92WI|1|The fit was way off and I ordered the size I normally wear.  The color looked like dirty white.  Even if they did fit correctly I don't know what I would have worn with them.  jmg
B00NAHLPV8|5|Fine
B00BXX5NRS|4|I love the hat and outfit.  Just adorable for my baby. I think it might fit a little small, because she is 19 lbs and going to grow out of it in another week or so.
B004C50BYY|1|The quality of this wallet is NOT worth $27:  1) the stitching is shoddy - thread sticks out in all places where the stitching ended. There is no revwrse stitching where the stitching ends either.  2) the zipper bends, making zipping the wallet a struggle. It also catches on the stitching.  3) there is a flat pocket and a gussetted pocket behind the zippered pocket. Both are open. Stuff I put in the gusetted pocket fall out.  4) the window pocket is covered by vinyl. I put my driver's license in it - it got stuck to the vinyl, making it a struggle to remove. This pocket is much too deep than it needs to be.  5) Only 3 credit card pockets. I only use 1credit card, but have numerous ither caeds (gym, parks, library, grocery, health card, dental card, etc.) Doubling them in the slots make them difficult to remove.  6) lined pocket behind the credit card slots is useless unless you have a very thin and narrow phone. With one card in each of tje credit card pockets, a book of checks is a TIGHT fit in this lined pocket.  7) the zipper stoos short leaving a gap. I put a shiny stainless pen inside the wallet - I lost it, so I assume it fell through this gap.    Unfortunately, I removed the tags and threw them out. I used the wallet for a week & wanted to mKework for me. After being embarassed twice at the grocery - taking forever to open the wallet, stuff falling out of its pocket and taking forever to zip the wallet shut, I gave up.    This wallet is going to the trash.    This is sad. I had purchased Overland Equipment bags years ago for myself and given away as presents. They were quality products made in the USA. In fact, I still use a donner bag from them purchased at least 10 years ago. I thought I was buying same quality product.
B00HV31K3U|4|I saw this mask a few weeks ago when I visited the Statue of Liberty and really wanted it. I just couldn't justify the $25 price for it so I passed. I then saw it on Amazon for a lot cheaper and took the chance it was the same mask. It is. Its a great mask, very well fitting, the eyes actually line up with mine and I can breathe through it. The only complaint is the points on the crown aren't stiff, so they don't stand up. You can insert popcicle sticks into the points and that will take care of it. Otherwise, a good product.
B001EB3JL6|2|Uncomfortable with a shallow crotch.  TAKE CAUTION when bending over while wearing these scrubs.  If you do, you'll likely bless the people behind with an view preferably meant to be concealed....!
B002R0FGK0|4|very good quality material. doesnt get fuzz balls after a few washes. will buy again.
B00880B6IE|4|I bought these for my daughter who really likes them and has worn them quite a bit.  These are a nice item for in between weather but she uses them mainly to &#34;goth up&#34; regular t-shirts a bit.  They have lasted fine through the wash.  I would consider them more arm warmers than fingerless gloves as they reach just above the wrist and do not really cover the hand at all (which is pretty clear from the picture.)
B00I0QJKG6|5|Very silly soft and very colorful. I like that it's comfy to sleep in AND sexy. Always a plus!
B00FWDSE6W|5|My daughter ordered this for herself (XS for a 12 year old) and it fits perfectly. Nice and warm without being bulky and of course she removed the hood to increase the &#34;cool&#34; factor. As a mom I like to know it can be reattached when the real cold hits. Good quality for a very good price.
B0037YZ5YC|5|The material was actually a lot tougher than I had imagined it being, but that was only a good thing. Very happy with the purchase.
B00I2IHP0U|5|Bought this pair for wife and she loved them. She was trying both the Flash Pro and Lightning Pro around the same time as she trained for her marathon. While we decided to buy the Flash Pro 'only' because of the vibrant color, she came to love the feel even more than the Lightning. Even running in the tropical, her feet did not feel too warm as the lighter material top was effective (much like the Lightning Pro). She actually prefer the slightly thicker and better cushioned material at the sole. The pair worked out excellent for her during the marathon even as the temperature climbed probably to over 30 deg C.
B009URG4C2|2|I wouldn't call this leather!  I have pictures of the &#34;black leather&#34; pealing off the belt!  Poor quality.  I am very disappointed...
B00AR8Y6PA|4|Cotton is perfect for new borns, I have washed it once.. Good for daily use. Will recommend as must buy if u are waiting for a new baby..
B00CH5UQS2|5|I do love the dress except I haven't actually been able to wear it yet because I had to have it hemmed at the dry cleaner. It is very, very long for us short girls so beware of that before you buy it. Material is cool & soft!
B003RHR7WW|5|They're tight, they're stretchy, and they're leopard print. They would make an excellent Christmas present, or any sort of present.
B00LGRB2GM|4|Fit great! Just wish the price could be lower.
B0056ZARQG|5|Earmuffs are warm, comfortable, stay in place without any discomfort.  These earmuffs look good and are very functional.  Highly recommend
B00JTQD5WG|5|Nice
B00DI616HO|4|The gloves look good and fit nicely. They are not as long as the picture leads you to believe, though.
B00BXBD8W2|3|I think its very cute, but the back bottom is a bit too short. I would recommend to wear spandex shorts.
B00OIGLZXI|5|These, ladies, are so flattering on a thin or a curvy figure.  The back of them has a sexy 40's seam, and the mock garter stretches long, so no worries for ladies with long legs. The quality is nice, and you cant beat the price. I bought 2 pair!
B00PJVXK3O|4|Love the dress  but tiny in waist
B00081FD08|5|I bought this wallet a few months ago and truly love it!  It has many places for credit cards, etc. and is constructed well.  Durable and high quality.  Definitely recommend.
B002HZCULS|5|Great for a 4 year old's arm for Halloween!
B007WHW5TI|5|Quick to ship. Good product!
B001I3AC60|3|Ok
B00UUX8KE0|5|Love it
B00FX7NC1O|5|My husband loves his balaclava, it's diffidently North Dakota winter friendly. Wish I could find pants and top in the same material. If any suggestions please email me at terri0871@yahoo.com
B000W4849S|5|Since colours are a variety of misconception online, I did find these to be a colour of the fuschia brand, and although from the picture was expecting some bright shade of hot pink, did get a lovely dark shade of mild fuschia, and must state that it turned out to be a very treasurable pile of poms, and very happy to of gotten. Yes, I do ever so love these poms and recommend highly.
B0008KLZMO|4|Satisfactory
B0055X1OSE|4|I think once I get the correct size I will like this shaping cami, however the size chart seems to be off a few sizes.
B00352GPEU|4|My dad is a bishop at his church and always in need of good white shirts.  He loved it and said it fit comfortably.  I was concern about buying it b/c he has a lot of fabric allergies but this shirt did not cause any skin allergies.  It was truly 100 % cotton.
B0068POQY2|5|And I watch &#34;Pawn Stars&#34;all of the time! We love the show and our favorite person is Chum Lee! Is is such a teddybear and way smarter than he looks or acts-sorry Chum!  I bought the t-shirt as a surprise gift for my husband and I know he will love wearing it with Chum's face on it! Great shirt!
B001I71RZQ|1|I have to admit that I had a small baby and perhaps it was his size, but honestly, we tried this cute and twice as expensive bunting for him. We never got him into it, so that he looked safe or comfortable.
B005HUKEE0|5|The t-shirt was just as advertised and arrived within a few days of ordering.  Entire transaction was a positive experience and I will definitely purchase from this seller, again.
B0017SO7N0|5|My husband says they are perfect. He loves them and they are such a good quality that I love them!
B008YE81XW|3|Some what too small, wish that they could have been purchased in a larger size.
B00PRUQYH6|4|I ordered the black and white stripes patterned version and got the plaid one it was still good regardless of that
B00AYZCGGM|2|Smaller than a regular 3X
B00M3NKDM2|4|thanks
B0091F84VW|4|These socks are lined and are so very soft and comfortable. Unfortunately I haven't run in them yet but I feel that these socks will make long runs very comfy!
B006K9XZ4I|2|Too baggy
B00AZHQM5U|4|Really nice.  It does not have any stretch so will need it a little larger.  It is a little tight across the back. But It is a very nice shrug.
B008U0KLNS|5|Good value for the price.  The adjuster device is difficult to operate.  They are more comfortable than the traditional style.
B00FL1WSGC|3|All in all its a cute light weight dress perfect for the Ca. heat.
B00822D1CC|2|They should list that they are maxi length; they need to revisit the sizing.  Much too large for a girls size 14.
B00DC5R77O|5|Bought this for a costume thing, it is so comfortable. Surprisingly durable and awesome! Wore outside on the streets and didn't actually get that dirty. Machine wash cold and air dry no issues.
B00PAUJXP8|5|Fits great and look great! My son just loves them and I'll be ordering more.
B00E1ZKYEW|4|This shirt is not fitted like the hugger style. this has more room in the back so your belly can hang out a bit more.  Im a fit build, so i prefer the hugger style. However, this will still look good on whoever wear it. ​
B004OWOYES|3|Acceptable but not great.
B00H2C0T6O|5|Long, had to get it altered but beautiful and flattering.
B001N7AD56|5|With the luxury of a specialty boutique in the neighborhood, I tried on many nursing bras. The support that this underwire-free bra provides is amazing! I felt better supported in it than in many of my pre-pregnancy bras with underwire. I also like how this bra holds you up so your chest isn't sagging, which can easily be a problem with a G-cup.<br /><br />Compared to other bras that I tried, I think this style runs a little large. It's perfect if you seem between sizes in other styles.<br /><br />Others have complained about it riding high and preventing you from wearing certain outfits. I don't believe a G-cup bra exists that can have enough support, keep uni-boob from developing during the day, and be low cut; I bought a special \\"dress-bra\\" for the V-neck dress when I needed it. Typical, \\"everyday\\" wear shirts look pretty nice with this bra underneath, as do dressier shirts without deep necklines; the bra can really provide a figure.<br /><br />The bra has a large hole to nurse through, instead of the whole cup coming down. A large portion of your breasts comes through the hole; and, ultimately, I found that I had to readjust the bra to stuff my breast back in for the best fit. It was not hard for me to adjust to this. However, if you're picky or your baby is picky, you might have some trouble adjusting. When the breasts are held up by a supportive bra, they are in a different position. And the hole (vs the entire open cup) keeps the breasts in position. Depending on your nursing style, this type of cup opening could be more or less discrete.
B0066C71KI|3|The material is soft and comfortable.  They look nice, but don't stay up very well.  Was delivered right on time which was great.  These are good pants for ladies who don't have thick thighs or butt.  I ordered the large pair and they fit alright but have to be pulled up constantly thanks to my large behind.<br /><br />Review update:<br />8 months later.  The pants are falling apart in the crotch area.  Not t oo bad though, I still love them and use them for at home lounging or working out.
B00NFGJ3G8|5|Based upon other reviews I ordered a size larger than I typically wear.  I normally wear a medium and I ordered a large and it fits perfectly.  I love this jacket, it's light weight and stylish and I like the fact that the hood can be taken off because I'm not a fan of hoods.  Highly recommend.
B00HQLP3X0|5|Very nice lightweight sweater.The small fit a little big on my tall 7 year old, but I expected that. Green color is as it appears.
B00IPKD75M|3|Fits well and comfortable,  but no where on the label does it indicate &#34;organic&#34; cotton -- label just reads 80% cotton. Definitely not worth the price without an organic guarantee.
B00KXY2C5Y|1|Quality was not as expected and the size is much larger than I expected.
B0009MKMOI|5|I bought this for my boyfriend and he loves it! Its been almost 2 years now and he still wears this all the time.  Its great since it can be worn in the winter with a sweater under it or in the spring/fall.
B00GZSGOLU|2|The quality was fine, just much smaller that I was anticipating.
B00BIPSOEU|5|GJ homie, GJ.
B00CA6VFUQ|2|I had searched for a red leather jacket this is made of sort of a denim that is treated and it is poorly made and fits poorly as well
B00L4N8EQ4|5|Love this jacket!  Best deal on Amazon too!
B009VKT1KU|4|I'm not sure you could really call it Elegant.  The Looped Scarf is nice for a casual day with jeans.
B00ET1V65E|3|I am not sure if the band is durable. Sizes are not accurate. They fit for now BUT...for how long??
B0007NCXBO|5|I gave these a five star rating, because they ate what i expected when i ordered them. If you are expecting to get a super nice bow tie, look else where. I would say that these were on part with the bow ties you used to get with the economy rental tux for prom. I bought them for all of the men in our church to wear while waiting on the ladies mother's day weekend, and they worked perfect for that.
B0027M6DD2|3|Nothing to say except what ever it takes to get the word out. I gave these out to the women in my family. Great way to remind us to care for ourselves
B00IX0T3V6|5|Very pleased with this purchase.  Cute suit!
B00CSLIIBC|3|The material is poor
B000NPI85G|4|I got this shirt as a gift for my husband. I ordered a large but looked like an XX-Large. The shirt looks amazing though.
B00OD26GCW|4|Appears to be durible. Holds multiple cards well.
B00O1331ZI|4|I like it. It's a little big on me, but I think it'll do the trick. My mom got the same hat and it fits her well.
B004UUL3FC|1|I bought this for my 3 year old granddaughter not realizing that it was for adults.  I was fooled by the size Extra Small.
B00J5OE15M|1|No goood
B00O9OUSSW|5|Cute little outfit.  Perfect dress up for early spring
B00EVLTIZM|2|Although it says &#34;Cotton&#34; in the product name, it has only 50+% cotton.  Fabric was okay for me, but the seams are sooooo itchy!!  I could not stand it for more than 10 minutes.  Seams on the back , seams on the sides, they were all itchy.  I never recommend it to anyone who has sensitive skin.
B00LGVMYC4|5|Birthday gift for my mother. She loved it!! Not sure how it holds up in the wash but the imagine looked great right out of the box.
B005GW6UBU|5|Was not over happy with the fit.  These run small.  But otherwise a nice shirt.
B007P00RA6|5|Out of everything in my closet, this dress is my favourite.<br /><br />- Unique and flattering design<br />- Attractive print<br />- Very pretty colour palette<br />- Material is light, comfortable, and high quality
B00SZ0IYFK|5|Super soft, super stretchy, pretty and comfortable. Going to probably be wearing this way too much.
B004H3XR2E|4|Really happy with these shorts. It's great to find petite sizing, so that's a plus. Fit great. Want to order another pair.
B0095BJJ4S|4|I'm not sure where other reviewers are buying their shirts, but this shirt fits as expected.  I usually wear a Size Medium from Banana Republic or Express, Based on the other reviewers, I ordered a Large and it was too big.  I exchanged it for a Medium and it fits perfectly.    The shirt is well constructed and the little details (contrasting cuffs, collars, buttons) definitely get noticed.  I will note that the colors are more muted than other English Laundry shirts I've seen.  I has a worn cotton more casual look as opposed to a slight sheen of a dressier shirt.
B008LY99CW|3|I thought this was funny, bought it for a friend.<br /><br />He didn't like that it said &#34;Kicking ass since..&#34;
B00NUBGG7W|3|These fit my 15 month old well (he is a big guy though) but are still a little tricky to get on.  Easier than most mittens though.
B004CO878M|5|Love these sports bras! There is a seam going down the middle on either side that helps cover up anyhing when you're cold.
B004LYUH3G|3|The belt its really well made, but runs really small
B007MY655G|5|Comfortable and cool.
B003YHNMQA|5|I love these low cut socks.  I do not like to wear socks in the summer, but my job I can not wear sandals any more and angle socks are so hot on your feet.  Brown low cut socks are VERY HARD to find.  These socks are awesome, they let air circulation and your feet do not get hot.  I am a FAN of Bamboo Low cust socks.........
B00P3L0R68|3|Good quality. Way too small.
B00BJTJN2W|3|i like this hood windbreaker, nice color, fit as expected, but obviosly not high quality some loose threads in the cuffs.<br />impermeable and comfortable.
B0030IMHQY|5|I love the feel and the fit of this Tee so much, I ordered more. The length is long (as pictured), and it didn't shrink up even when I threw it in the dryer. Very lightweight, soft and comfy! I bought it to workout in, but I wear it all the time.
B00HMHKTWI|5|My husband finally found a sweatshirt that fits him really well--He likes this 100%
B00MWH3RNG|5|Perfect
B00L4GWQ5Q|5|It's very light and comfortable and I love the way it looks. It can be worn on the shoulder off the shoulder and still look cute. It hides the bit of belly I have while still showing off the curves I want to show off. I'm 5&#34;4' and it comes down to just below my knees. It is hand-wash only though.The picture was taken at an awkward angle, so it looks longer than it really is.
B008E7IAFI|5|Very slimming. A little long but I can fix that. I'll just wear high wedges with it. Can't wait to wear it.
B004A7XY48|4|You can't go wrong with this purchase if you know your size.  I am extra comfortable with these for some reason.
B00IXREALM|5|So soft my dad loved it!
B000FKK0U0|5|Great hat. So great
B00IT5HJPW|2|You get what you pay for! It looks and feels cheap.
B00857U0Q4|4|Real nice, fits as expected, great quality jeans. But slightly too long, and the legs r not not soo straight. 4 stars cos I love d feel and colour and fitting around d hips and waist.
B00719Y75M|4|I enjoy wearing this shirt. However it is starting to fray here and there from light office use (little more than 5 months of use).
B000ROC3YU|3|you get what you pay for. it's cheap (like FLIMSY plastic cheap) and the eyes curve in so badly that your eye lashes are scrunched.
B0055XOBYS|4|These are really, really stretchy. They're also pretty cheaply made, and I can see them breaking easily. However, considering they were like 5 bucks and cheaper than anything else I could find, I'm pretty happy with them. They work pretty well, just tighten them a little more than you think you need, and be prepared to replace them. If you're expecting quality, skip these, if you just need something in a pinch, these will do.
B0057M519Q|5|Adorable!  My daughter loved it and it kept her warm
B00GHVCA18|2|I ordered the khaki and it was not the same color as what I saw in the picture. It had a terrible smell, but came out when I washed it. It was a lot shorter than I expected. It also had a few snags in it.
B000BKRML4|5|Great fit.  They last a long time.  I used these when I was deployed to the middle east, they held up very well and kept me cool.
B0002TORUI|2|These socks shrink too much over time. Maybe they need to be dried on a cool setting or avoid using a drier. I have not been pleased with the fit because of them becoming too small.  They stretch out some with effort but they are no longer the size I ordered.  They have not developed holes, like any good industrial polyester material, but they tend to collect lint and pill after a dozen washes. They tend to get too slippery in the shoe, like a good industrial polyester sock is designed to do, I guess.
B0041LIY9I|5|Exactly what I was looking for!
B007VBCAGI|5|im 5'6 130lb and these fit nicely, i ordered a L btw, n i wear S so order 2 sizes up
B00EQCUNVY|4|When it first came out of the packaging I was a little surprised because it looked much smaller than I had expected. However, after slipping it on, the fabric had a lot of stretch and it fit really nice. I'm a size 14/16  with slightly bigger than average hips and it was still sexy and not ill fitting.<br /><br />The only down side, which earned it 4 stars and not 5 is the net material snags easily. So if you are wearing rings, or accessories, be careful not to get them all caught up in each other.
B00AARJCKM|5|Perfect fit, great pockets!
B0006LT3YM|4|From pic expected grey but rec'd white. Fit fine
B00R6RXI5E|5|Small fit me fine (I'm usually a size 4).  I've got nothing to complain about, I love everything about it.  The coral color is great, it seems well made, and it's got a lot of nice details, like the roll tab sleeves.  Perfect for travel, too.  And a great deal.
B004UPUFFQ|5|The material is very good, the details are very good quality without doubt one of the best costumes I've purchased, I highly recommend it.
B00GA5NP2E|5|Love them great jeans for the price!!
B00IE2C9VY|5|I'm 4'10, bought a medium and it's pretty baggy, but that's how I wanted it. It's comfortable and keeps me warm. Can't wait to buy more.
B00CIYFS3K|3|It lifted my buttocks pretty good but it was extremely too tight... it's worth the money if you want the perfect lift
B00U1IM22U|1|I didn't like how in the picture this shirt looks long sleeved and it was short. Not what I was expecting
B0068EW1I6|3|the quality is there  a well made product  the only thing is that the pockets that hold the checks, holds them too high for the book to close properly,  especially with the thicker check packs.  still a well made product.
B00C6J3776|5|Great case for my husband's oakleys. Just what he wanted.
B007O0PAC2|5|It's very large since it's one size fits all and is kind of unflattering but a very cute, adorable and fun costume. Nice quality and cheap price compared to Halloween stores. Get this is you want to be comfortable the whole night.
B00LWO1GMO|5|Very beautiful.
B007N7YNMO|5|It's lined which surprised me, so I can wear it as a cover up or a sundress. It is gorgeous! Love the colors. I will be taking it with me on vacation.
B00M4ITSBS|5|Looks just as good as pictured and is super comfortable.
B00IR57FXA|1|Sizes seem to run small, ordered the Large (36) when I opened the package it looked like it was a child size?
B00DHOC78E|4|excelente producto
B00C391RGW|3|A little undersized...
B000GHMSA2|3|Car hart pants have pockets on both legs and the bibs only on the right side. Years ago when I purchased them they had pockets on both sides. Very disappointed.
B00F92A7HA|3|Very comfortable. For skiing I wore these, a pair of regular leggings, and my ski pants. I was perfect in under 20 degree weather and a little hot closer to 30's. BUT a hole appeared along the seam after 1 use. Not a big deal under ski pants, but can't use them for much else now.
B00U30AJQW|2|Cute top, but too large... even in X-small. Most of KOI products are really nice looking scrubs, but run big. Would have loved if they fit. Very disappointed. Had to send back
B0036SJC0C|5|I've purchased many of these for iron on logos, patches, and embroidery at the mall kiosk. Fun to wear and makes a most unique gift.
B00WIWU4P4|5|Loves these, and they're super soft
B00HB2FEA6|5|Perfect fit
B00BBXXTTE|3|I liked these, they reminded me of coulottes when I was younger. However, I didn't care for the material, it was very scratchy and I hate scratchy things next to my body.
B00K6C5QQ0|2|Ridiculously thin fabric - can see right thru it.  The only reason I kept it is because my son likes the color.  Great sewing but why not use a better quality fabric?  Comes out of the dryer looking horrible, too.  Also, runs very large around the neck and thru the waist.  If I hadn't gotten this on a lightning deal, I'd have returned it...
B00NVOCEA6|5|Item arrived on time and as expected. I needed a night gown for after surgery in the hospital. The button down closure was exactly wgphat I expected and designed well so last button it slightly off to the side avoiding a accidental opening when walking. The fabric was soft and the design colorful. I'm 5'2&#34;, 161 pound with 38 DD chest. The medium was perfect for me and with a pull over bra made by 'Just My Size' I was quite comfortable on second day after surgery when the IVwas removed, however with the front button down I possibly may have worked with an IV. I will probably purchase another, I was so pleased with this product
B00FXUP4EE|4|The shorts fit good but make sure to pay attention to the size chart.
B004HH59S0|5|I've been dealing with one of my bra straps slipping off my shoulder all my life. Tried different things, pins, snap-on holders; worked but a pain. Then these popped into my sight from &#34;I don't know where&#34; and I tried them, or one of them (only need one). It worked beautifully. At the end of the day, I realized I hadn't dug into my sweater to pull the strap up all day!! Thanks! Finally.<br />Now to see how they work in the summer when it is much hotter. Some reviews mentioned a shoulder getting hot and even blistering. Even so, for something that will work most of the year, I am grateful!
B003ZSB3K0|5|I have just finished composing and creating my 2nd Musical Yoga Adventures CD, called Musical Yoga Adventures:World Journey. I have a song on it called: In the Desert, which I \\"kid-tested\\" and \\"yoga teacher-tested\\", using these hip scarves. Everyone loved using the scarves, and there were lots of smiles and laughs!! I have been told by pts and ots that using these scarves and shaking hips helps to center kids and works their core in beneficial ways. My CD and these scarves are both for sale on Amazon.com. Check them out!
B00A8IXHFY|5|Love the full workable string. Was able to order a little large to last longer - and not worry about poor little guys butt crack!
B0085IG3T6|5|Quality: Very good! The bangs even come pre-cut and the wig is extremely soft.<br />Color: The color was perfect, a nice deep purple, perfect for a Ririchiyo cosplay.<br />Shipping: The shipping was on time as expected :)<br /><br />I recommend this seller! Will definitely buy again!
B004I7B2CG|4|Love this Teddy! Color is very vivid and vibrant... The only problem I had is it's a little loose... I ordered a 1X because I am a plus sized girl, and surprisingly, it was a little big on me... Other than that, it's a great product!
B00LBD71N4|5|I plan to order more in every color.  They are so comfortable.
B008CGY4Z6|5|Great value and great fit for a very small and short person like me...For reference I'm 4'10&#34; and 100 lbs
B003U2GQWQ|5|I like low ankle socks.  These have ribs in them that are supposed to help control moisture.  I cant say that it really works or not, but they are comfy anyway.
B00B6ECEOO|2|Wore it once, washed it once. Hole in the seam line on the button hole side! I was hoping to wear it a few more times before holes started to appear.
B001C6KDBC|5|Bought this to use over top of my thermal hanes when out on my bicycle this winter.  They do seem well made and fit just fine.  I like the jersey feel...
B001EJXAIK|1|These little caps barely fit my son for a week after he was born, and he was not a big baby, only about 7 1/2 pounds. Even when they did fit him I preferred the one they gave him in the hospital because these were stiff and cheap-feeling, even after washing. Then, of course, he outgrew them instantly anyway.
B0074CBTI4|1|Way to small for an extra large!
B00GFSVGHM|5|The hat came as promised and is a great quality hat, what else can I say? I really am happy with this purchase!
B00CO95U3C|5|See through and sexy. Don't wear them outside unless you want to pick up a dirtbag.
B008D4TUAG|5|It is great and a fair price!
B00X6FPMNG|5|Excellent
B00861UZ14|4|I really like the contrast coloring on the sleeves of the sweater and that it is not too clingy. I suggest looking at the actual seller's sizing chart for the greatest accuracy but it generally corresponds amazon. Good purchase, fast delivery.
B006IUXPU8|4|These aren't bad, for the price... just wish they were softer. I am not overly sensitive but these are scratchy material.
B00528DJIU|5|My husband loves this shirt. The sizing seems true to size. It hangs perfectly and he already had tons of comments on it
B0084YM8EK|1|Sent me wrong size and with a big rip in the side of it.Cheap material. It was just horrible
B00WK2E6FQ|5|Just shiny enough. Rich colors and washed very well. Can wear with different styles - skirt or pants. Hangs nicely and feels slinky. Rather slimming as well.
B0009WD4RU|4|Shirt was good and cheep, but it was much bigger than 2T, it did not fit my 2 year old, it was more like actual size 3-4T.
B00GV3A1HW|4|fits perfectly, I find the cloth too thin though, otherwise it's perfect overall.
B00NGWQ422|5|Fit perfectly and served it's intended purpose! Sweet Seduction!
B00KBA9M5S|5|Great socks and a great price!!
B00A8F9ZB2|4|This dress would be great for a tall person. Unfortunately, I'm about 5'3\\" and short-waisted, so this dress doesn't look all that great on me. The fabric is high-quality and sturdy and the neckline is very flattering. However, the torso is very long, so the seam across the waist (where the belt is on the model in the picture) is almost around my hips! It looks so unflattering on me, so sadly I will have to return it. If only I had a longer torso!
B000EW6AM6|4|This is a very nice, quality made windbreaker.  When I bought, it was on sale for $25 - regular price said to be $50.  I would not buy at $50, but for $25 it's a good buy.  Nice features - two inside pockets for putting things, lightweight for those times when you just need a bit of a jacket to take the chill off.  It's not water repellent; the cuffs have a strip with velcro so you can adjust.  My wrists are small, so it's difficult to get the cuffs properly adjusted.  Elastic cuffs would have been better.  All in all, I'm happy with the purchase, and the service from the seller was excellent.
B00O8SGQ44|5|This was a baby shower favorite!!  So cute and so different!  Also very soft fabric.  Thank you!!
B00K31U3OY|4|A bit thin ....
B00JDU6YW6|2|I have bought other one size items from this seller and found they fit well, but this was way too narrow in the bust and shoulders. I gave it to my daughter who wears a normal medium and after wearing it to lunch today she came home and said it really was too tight for her even. We are donating it since she wore it today and we can't return it. It really is as cute looking as the picture though.
B00ACIGVH6|5|My husband, is now a former tidy whitey fan. He loves the boxer briefs from Hanes.....Margie K.
B00LVFDO8S|1|The material is cheap and stiff and the dress itself is out of shape plus the workmanship is scrappy. I will never purchase anything from this seller again.
B00N2YAHEA|5|Gloves work great fit snug and are very warm
B002GKIMO8|5|I'm not one to typically buy something like this but I did and let me tell you it REALLY does work!  I started wearing it an hour after birth and it has done wonders 11 days post pregnancy.  I'm not sure yet how much better this can work as it says to wear up to 6-8 weeks after birth.  However, very happy with what it has done already.  Very pleased.
B00LTSSIOM|1|Terrible quality of fabric
B00NE1T1L6|5|Great style for any active kid!
B003JH8TE0|5|lol got it for halloween, it came in time and it was pretty cool, my friend did not have a costume so he enjoyed it the most
B00GPEA86G|5|Love these jeans! Some stretch, true skinny leg and ankle, fit my butt well.
B00KPHO6VM|5|Awesome old school Lucky Brand Indian 3/4 sleeve shirt. Love the feel of the fabric and look. Fits perfect
B00JL6XPXS|4|Super cute my daughter loved it
B0087ZSWBE|5|In truth, I feel that the headline says it all. I have bought three belts from this company's line. They were beautiful, I did not expect to be so pleased I just had a few shirts and skirts that didn't work best without a waist belt. So I found these and I couldn't be happier. Honestly (probably shouldn't say this but) I would even have paid more, now knowing how fantastic the fit, the quality, the style and the confidence they gave me. A must for any woman who feels empowered by dressing in their own style: perfect for the youthful professional, for the respectably sexy night life, and even just for going to class.<br /><br />Recommend to anyone, can wear it high or low, can move to above the hips or mid waist, the elastic stretches well and the cuff in front is reinforced so that sitting down doesn't make it crumple.  On this design in specific I was More than Pleased with the Chinese knot work, soft and forgiving but sturdy and dependable. Great Buy!
B00FNJCMQS|5|Great white jeans with heavy fabric to prevent VPL.
B00B563XC0|3|I'm normally a MED, so I ordered LRG; but this is still too tight.  The product itself is ok, but you'll have to order 2 sizes up.
B000J47N84|3|This costume is made of thin, cheap material. The belt buckle is thin plastic and keeps falling out of the slits it attaches into. The hat does not stay on at all, even after I added elastic to the back. One of the costumes I got already had a velcro piece fallen off and I had to sew it back on. The arm bands are WAY too big, I had to cut the elastic and tie the ends as close as I could to get them to stay on. However, my 3 year old loves it. If your child is a die-hard Lazytown fan like mine are, this costume may still be worth buying as it is very hard to find Lazytown items. Be prepared to do some alterations though. If they are not going to be thrilled to have a Sportacus costume however, don't waste your money.
B00CVJQF2K|4|it came almost 10 days early (woo hoo)<br />it's fully lined with a satiny material<br />functional pockets - so happy  about that detail<br />both arms have an embroidered patch while the back is a large print<br />not bad construction<br />the only problem is its a bit short, falls just under the bust<br />otherwise, for the price and speed of delivery, i'm happy
B00KVMMZ9Q|3|Would have preferred it be of a different material.
B00J4Z0XDG|2|Didn't realize they were childrens.  Not as they appear.
B00EMG3WG2|5|These are perfect for my growing baby. I keep him in these pajamas because at home they are super easy for changing diapers. They also have the great option to cover the hands with a built in flap if you want! It's great if my baby is cold or has sharp nails that I can't get to until he's calm or asleep. The colors are simple which I love! I recommend these.
B000M9JJ7O|3|just okay, nothing to write home about.  I only wore it once or twice, kinda baggy all over.  Good for workouts but thats it
B00OID29UE|4|Love it!
B00FB6GDSG|5|I've always been a fan of Southpole jeans. I will admit I like the older styles fit better, but the new styles they have are classy, and comfortable.
B00L6EJTOC|3|Smaller than expected. My boy only got a couple of wears out of them...maybe they shrunk in the wash?
B005GVK33C|5|Love these nighties. I'm in between a size 1X and 2X. Thought I would get 2X? Should of got 1X
B00MV2TOFC|5|Cute PJs.  Fit my 4 yr. old perfectly.  Good quality clothing.
B006ODTJVS|3|Colors are awesome, sock fits fine...in the calf.  However, the band at the top is very tight, especially for a &#34;curvy&#34; sock.  My calves are about 17.5&#34; and these fit, but i'm hoping the top gives a little.  Unfortunately, in order to try them on, you pretty much have to destroy the packaging.  I may end up giving these to a slightly smaller co-worker.  It's sad, because they're pretty :(  Also, these are not very thick, so if you're looking for thick socks, this would not be the best option.
B009FBW07Q|3|The colors are rich and beautiful, and the price was very affordable. Love the length of them, too. I would recommend them to friends and family.
B00DY71ADM|5|good
B0006N4Y5S|4|All the other baby socks slide right off, but these stay on, look cute, and wash easily in the bag.  The only bad thing is that they do look \\"frazzled\\" as mentioned elsewhere.  Still worth it!
B00B281M3I|5|cannot wear shoes without socks and even though i have always worn Peds in my shoes, this product is beyond compare, so comfortable and the fit is perfect...thank you
B00E3GIV30|3|I am repeating what another reviewer wrote, but its worth saying because Flint and Tinder needs to think about this.  I own the three versions of the Heritage underwear - briefs, trunks, and boxer briefs and am a big fan of the latter two.  The briefs, not so much.<br /><br />First, Flint and Tinder makes its underwear in the US with American labor and materials.  Second, the materials and fabrication are excellent.  You wont find a higher quality cotton underwear this well made at any price.  Those two factors make the company well worth considering.  The fit of the trunk and the boxer brief are outstanding.  They fit as they should on size and they fit my anatomy the way I want.  They fit snugly in the legs and seat - not binding, but they are not baggy and hanging loosely like some brands.  But, they also have a contoured pouch in the front that is very comfortable.  The pouch is roomy and stays in place keeping my man parts where they should be rather than sagging and bunching like other brands.  The trunk and boxer brief get five stars plus.<br /><br />The briefs are another story.  What I don't understand is why the design did not incorporate the contoured pouch from the other designs.  All they had to do was keep the design from the trunk and shorten the legs.  But, the pouch on the brief is just like any other flat brief.  In order to make it roomy, it seems like they just added a bunch of fabric with the result being a floppy, over-sized front panel with leg openings that are too big.  The result is disappointing overall.  I have been wearing Hilfiger briefs that incorporate a contoured pouch and would gladly have switched to F+T briefs, but not with this design.  I will, however, switch to the trunks and boxer briefs as they fit perfectly.
B00R7CLKKS|3|Tried twice and didn't get the shirts pictured. We received three other curious george shirts, still cute but wanted ones pictured.
B007ABQ204|5|First of all : quality is great! Fits amazing! I'm 5\\"8 and 127 size S is perfect for me! Can't wait to wear it in few days for Hallowen party! I think adding a wig & some Marmaid make up it will be shoot in 10! Second of all extremely fast shipping ! TY !!
B00J5Q4M1I|4|This shirt came very promptly and looks like the picture provided. The 4 stars instead of five is because the shirt is very lightweight and I prefer a thicker tshirt.
B007ZTVZTO|5|This coat is adorable and very flatterting.  It is a lighter weight, so perfect for me in Texas.  It does not button up all the way to the neck, so keep that in mind.  You ahve to use a scarf to keep your upper chest/neck warm on very cold days.
B00CYY53V6|4|very nice cargo Shorts
B00BG6H712|4|Simply love the design of this set, so sweet and girly... especially the tiers which bounce up and down when my girl paces around in it.  However be warn that the size runs really small, 4T fits my 2yo girl (29lb, 33.5in) perfectly... Good thing both top and bottom is stretchy , hopefully can last a couple more months.  Wash and dries well with minimum ironing... Great for busy moms!!
B00LAF0NOC|5|Even cuter on my grandaughter, and fits perfectly.  She was so happy!
B009B2QALQ|3|Bought this for my son. The item has started to pill after about 4-5 washes. Disappointing. The screen print is in good shape and the size is a true fit. Just not the greatest quality fabric.
B0096PBWI4|3|Really love love love this color combination of Currant/Bright Blue, and wanted these shorts to work out so badly. The material feels nice, and it looks like quality stitching. Unfortunately, the blue band portion is weirdly loose in the middle, and creates an unattractive muffin-top bulge. I tried to fold it over, but it just doesn't work. I'm so disappointed, but had to return them!<br /><br />I wish Kalon made this color combination in their Juniors Longer Length Fold Over shorts - I was very happy with those!!
B009PO6IV2|5|Went to an ugley sweater party and it was a big hit.  Love the fit and the material it was made with. Very Soft
B002SFN5DY|5|I am a size 6 but have big wide hands- got these for a trip to Alaska- great price I love pink AND they fit my wide hands- Lucky it's just my hand and not the rest of me LOL!
B0071NQCK6|5|Proud auntie couldn't help herself!
B00LW4RWA4|5|my gr son is a normal 6 yrs old reg size. This robe size 8 fits him just for now, haven't washed it yet, and probably will not put it in the dryer...size seems to run small, like the other people said, should have gotten a 10. The robe is nice and soft, and best of all he loves it. Took some time to get here, on the last day; no doubt due to the holidays.
B00HNKLE0K|5|I love this scarf! This is a great scarf, very fashionable and you can't beat the deal. What a bargain!
B009AOZBOC|5|Nice; comfortable .... Great fit.  It's a strapless bra - they fit differently than regular ones.
B00HN6P8PQ|5|Great t-shirt.
B009OC7HAQ|5|I am a size 38B and usually have difficulty finding a good fitting bra.  I ended up finding this bra at a department store last month, and I love it. It looks and feels like it was made for me.  I looked it up online, and found it on Amazon.com. I like the online price even more, and will definitely get more in the future
B003N18GU4|4|Just received this today...Looks and feels great, exactly what I was looking for. The stitching in the picture is different than the stitching on the billfold I received (it's black).....Not a bad thing, but something to consider when ordering. That's the only thing keeping it from 5 stars.
B00D3WPHP0|5|Warning! Order one to two sizes up because these hats run small. My baby is only 5 months with a head circumference of 15.4. Yes my baby head big lol. I ordered the 24 month and it fit perfectly with plenty of room for her to grow in. Great material and even more beautiful in person.
B009WRRUAU|5|item exactly as described
B006UR3WCA|4|It´s long and have a great fit. Unfortunately, lose coor with washing. All in all, it´s a great maternity pant.
B002BTUCKG|5|I usually wear a large size cap, but medium size hats fit perfect, unless you have an (extreeeemley) large head, buy this hat in a medium size. great for rain or sunny days, keeps rain off your face& sun off your ears, face, back off your neck, nice looking, comfortable, the cord can be worn in the back close to the base of the scull.
B00VX79FK0|5|&#34;Looks just like picture fits perfect and the material is nice and soft&#34;
B00JC2VE7A|3|I was actually expecting it to fit better, but its just as loose on the Model. To get a better fit I used a black belt with it to align with the black strip on the waist.<br />The fabric is good so if you want a dress without fitted waist and I guess it would be okay for someone with a big waist line it would hide the bulge.
B008YWF84O|3|Great fit, but the drawstrings started to unravel on the first wearing.
B00H2SUVNE|4|Fabric is hard to keep from wrinkling because it's recommend to air dry tunic but the size is true for me. I usually take a med in t shirts but got a small due to drape fabric. Would buy another.
B004289DQS|5|I've been wearing Gold Toe ever since I saw Pud's recommendation so long ago. They're the only socks I've bought that feel comfortable and last a long time.
B00IG5V8PC|4|Too long for my legs.
B00JL9OILS|5|Great quality craftsmanship and a good looking jacket. Looks even better in real life than in the picture. I have been using it for going out and it gets used about every other day, still have not had problems after a month. The zippers are of good quality and do not seem to get stuck. The leather feels good to the touch and has a very nice sheen to it.
B00MHTQIZ8|3|Im returning it because I don't like the way it fits. Its bulky and you wont be able to wear under anything fitting because of the way it points in both front and back so that kind of defeats the purpose of waist training with this type of corset. Also, I wasnt satisfied with the type of laces it comes with. Not the traditional corset lace but a shoe string type; uh NO! Im going to orchard corsets for an under bust type of corset.
B00ISLHTBQ|1|More like a cheap see-thru lingerie that doesn't hold it's shape than a supposed 2 pc set of thermals.  I contacted the seller immediately upon receipt of package, via email as Amazon instructed, but never got a reply.  I wanted a refund and still do.
B001MEM5GA|5|If you are researching and looking for a bra with great support because you are larger upstairs than all your friends who don't understand what we go through, then this is the bra for you. Before purchasing my Anita, I spent hours reading reviews on this sports bra and others. Although my sisters are basically smashed together and to my chest, they are not going anywhere. Believe me I did my usual bra tests of jumping up, j. jacks and running, and they are well supported. The Extreme control really helps them from moving which helps me focus on working out, with out the worry and self consciousness that I always had before.
B002S52GFW|3|The shorts are more like baggy style, not straight leg as in the photo. To be honest they are not bad and good quality textile.
B004M6UDC8|3|The wallet looks and feels nice. The zipper handle broke off on the 1st use. I attached one that I had on a pair of pants to it which still works. Over all I like the wallet but I feel like the zipper handle should be of better quality. I got the wallet for a good price and I would buy another one if I get it at the same price. $9.99.
B0041OFBNC|5|This does run on the large side, so I ended up lightly sewing the bottom few inches up. It's thick and quite substantial, and coupled with a lightsaber, it makes for a very effective costume.
B00EGJ1QHW|5|i got this for my sons girlfriend for her prom and she really likes it, it looks great with her dress also.
B00IG401P6|5|nice
B00MVXRU7U|5|I bought this dress after reading the reviews to buy a size up. Thank God for me, there was no size up available. So I got stuck with my true size and lord knows, I was happy. There is no need to buy a size up. Stay with your true size. You will be happy you did. And again,let me stress the material was excellent and the print exactly as displayed.
B00U7X6T3C|3|I love what it looks like but runs a bit small.
B00BR0QDIU|5|super cute!!
B008LWS6SM|4|Nice shirt. Material and workmanship seem good. Does seem to run a bit small though.
B00ODT54DM|5|Worked like a charm!
B007YH5UZC|5|Really like both the look and feel of these socks!  I hate thin socks, especially ones with patterns that require 'knots' or ridges inside the sock.  These are exactly the opposite - nice and thick, with no noticable &#34;feel&#34; from the pattern.  They look great, too, nicely complementing both dress and casual pants.
B00BB7RCY8|1|This coat is taking over a month to be delivered!!! Had I known, I never would have made the purchase, I hope this coat is well worth the wait, winter will be over!
B001H6VYXI|3|.knit is off kilter but is adjustable, big toe, good.  other toe area not shaped correctly but not uncomfortable. fits good in regular shoe too.
B009XIHVLQ|3|Large size was a bit too big for me... love the colors.  Will go for medium size next time for lucky brand women's apparel
B00CQEP4P4|2|I had no problem with the material the pants were made from.  My problem   was the label size.  Not being familiar with the sizes, I made the mistake  of thinking the the size 4XL would mean that the pants were comparable to   the US standard 4X. This was a mistake I will not make again.  Always keep  in mind that 4XL is not available (according to the chart) it only goes to   an 18 indicated by the Size chart.  Otherwise, the pant would have been great.
B008O85IQQ|5|Nice pin, very decorative and represents the U.S. perfectly !!!
B00JU8W0BA|4|I am 5&quot;5 female weighing at 145 lbs and bought a Medium. The type of girl who has all her fat go straight to her thighs and misses her butt ....I just received my order and it took as little as 2 days to arrive ! Phenomenal service . I love how instantly lifted my butt looks the only thing I would say is negative is the thickness of this product and also no information with my purchase provided-what if I wanted to return it...but I don't !!! I love this Butt lifter and will highly recommend it to my girls.  Other than that it really works !!!
B00BCKQMWM|5|The fit is perfect, and he wears it all the time. No extra string from the embroidery or stitching. Overall good hat!
B0009G4CAO|4|As expected which says a lot these days......It the perfect color.  I also like the feel of the shirt.  Good quality!
B00DHMRG32|5|Beautifully made.
B004EJPNBY|4|Purchased this wallet for my husband almost 2 years ago.  I agree about the latch but if you are careful the wallet can last a long time.  He loves it.  Only gave it a four star because of the latch.  Manufacturer needs to do something about fixing the latch.
B008UN6HL0|3|Loved the color. The sleeves were a little snug, seemed to run small. The shirt tail should be longer so will stay tucked in pants better.
B00ALZ25I4|5|Very good quality - bought this for my husband & he likes it!
B000MR3T6I|2|This bra smashes your boobs up to your neck. Would be great if you were planning on being in a Victorian themed costume party.
B004D38R14|4|very good indeed
B00BI3EHKC|1|small fit and does not have the sheen as seen in the photo
B005243I9O|5|The jeans are a perfect fit and the color is very dark, also perfect, the price is the best I've seen. Can't go wrong with these, just make sure you want loose fitting jeans before ordering. Will be buying more.
B00SIGLMG4|5|the shipping was fast, the color is vivid, and these look great paired with a nice t shirt. all of my friends want to know where they can buy these
B00GXHHPUM|1|I saw reviews saying they fell apart in the wash, just to clarify these specifically state that they are HAND WASH AND LINE DRY ONLY, so putting them in the wash is guaranteed to ruin them.    As far as these panties go I'm kind of mixed.. they are super cute and sexy, and show off your butt really well, but they are a little bit small.. I'm usually a medium in pantie sizes, but the medium/large size for these is still a little bit tight. That being said if you have a petite frame these will look and feel amazing on you, just order a size up if you're not 100% sure.    And remember, HAND WASH/LINE DRY ONLY.    EDIT/UPDATE: previously I had these at 4 stars, now I drop them to 1 for a very very simple reason, well two actually.    1) they are super comfortable to wear and extremely sexii for sex and other naughty times, but only for the ten minutes you still have them on at those times. Today I wore them as regular panties as it was laundry day, my panty line is completely chaffed and I'm in pain, single most uncomfortable panties I'VE WORN TO DATE!! Short periods of time are fine, longer than an hour and it gets uncomfortable, all day wear is a new form of torture technique, no joke.    2) the material this is made from is absolutely horrible smelling, because of the material if you wear these all day expect a horrible blend of crotch rot odor mixed with plenty of burning rubber smell, they smell absolutely horrible, and I normally don't smell, even down there, as I practice exquisite hygiene due to my OCD for such odors. THIS SHOULD SAY SOMETHING!!!     TLDR Version:  Going to wear them for sex or bedroom activities, great product  Going to wear them for more than an hour, expect to small like crotch rot/burnt rubber and chaff like never before.
B004SWJ4T4|5|Love this Jacket, much cheaper then straight black and fits great!
B00PJ6WH1U|5|Thank you for the super-fast shipping and they fit just great!!!! Thank you!!
B00WQT3DMU|4|I love it!
B00C0PIRAS|1|I got the size I get everything else in so if you get this get at least 1 size bigger
B00HR9IOWS|4|I am a size 8 and these are a little loose but the grippies keep them in place.  So far, so good!
B00GICLT40|5|The pajamas are super soft and warm, not to mention super cute. It seems well made. Button front. Elastic at the feet and wrist. Plus there are pockets. Also there is lots of room.
B005G7DYNM|2|The quality just wasn't there with this product.  It fell apart very quickly.  I've never had a belt wear out in less than a year before.  While cheap, they weren't that cheap compared to other belts I've purchased that lasted much longer.
B00FFTVDNE|5|Fits true to size and my granddaughter loves it.
B005DIIWHC|5|True size and not made big or small love these jeans very comfy for me thank you for recomending these
B00OD50VHA|5|Loved this jacket. Was very warm and comfortable.3in1 is a great feature!
B00KTHMIWC|1|This pair was way to small. The stitching on top to tight. So sad. The first pair was great. So bought this pair. Dont know if ill try again .
B00CAAQH5A|1|I was extremely disappointed in how yhe jeans fit amd look. I have a pair of 515 bootcut from a few years ago and love them. The demin material is different om the new pair; they are more like bell bottoms; and when put against my old pair of 515's they are bigger ( my old pair are a size 6 and fit better which I just cant understand.) If I hadn't already washed the jeans I would send them back. I'll probably turn them into shorts. What a waste of money. Will never buy jeans off the internet again.
B00E94EM0C|5|They are perfect. They were a Christmas gift for my son, he loves them!
B001MAAGX8|4|When I got this wallet I thought it was going to be very small and less space for my things. Turns out that it has a lot of pockets for my things and is not that small. What I really like about this is that it has two different kind of folds two put in my big money bill and my small money bill, and the strong genuine scent of this wallet may bother a little once you open it, but it'll go away by time. I would recomend this for people who are first time shopppers for wallets.
B00D07W0OE|4|I love AG denim, because of the soft material they are consistently using. I usually buy the Stilt model, but I thought I would give the Legging a try. I ordered one size up from my Stilt size 25, because I was afraid the leg would be too tight. To my surprise, the jeans fit biggish all over the leg and the thigh, however the waist was tight. I would need to order one size down, but then I am not sure how comfortable the waist would be. This was surprising to me, because usually I have the problem of the waist being big. I have a small waist compared to my hips and thighs. Unfortunately, I had to send these back, but if the Legging is a good fit for you, I recommend these jeans, because the quality is really nice and they are offered at a very good price here on Amazon.
B00RY881T8|5|Like them.
B00GADJAQQ|5|I love it !!!
B007PXVAIQ|5|My husband just loves these shorts! I bought these in two colors. My husband wears these for tennis and they wash up well.
B00I8S3HQA|4|I looked very good on the Anibis costume I wore to a Halloween Party.  The mask, being latex, was hot to wear and my field of vision was limited, but I looked good as the Egyptian Guardian of the Dead.
B00CM8X7C6|4|This tshirt was true to fit when it arrived, but did shrink after being put it the dryer to fluff. My guy is a big Who fan and he loved it :)
B000J5RHHK|4|The last one I bought was reddish brown and I would have bought it again but they don't have that color any more?  The last one lasted over two years. Plating on the buckle did not deteriorate nor did the looks, but it did loose it's stretch ability and was getting sort of twisted out of shape.
B00T7C07GE|5|My dress arrived well in advance of my wedding. It fits perfectly! Well crafted and fine attention to detail. Looking forward to wearing it on my big day!
B001MUP2EG|5|The sexy microfiber single strap sports bra top feels very comfortable. I can barely tell I am wearing it since the fabric is so light.  I wish I would have ordered a size smaller. I am size 8 t-shirt and I bought the medium. I should have purchased small.
B00NAXFZH2|2|As a rule for joggers always go 2 sizes up. I'm 6'2 205lbs athletic build. Thick thighs from playing basketball. I wear a size 36 Levi's 511 jeans for a loose fit around my thighs but I'm actually a 34 waist Levi's 514. All the south pole joggers size XL fit perfect. Got these size XL and it fits too baggy because it's not a slim fit jeans. Not even a loose fit it's just baggy as hell. Like 1992 baggy fit jeans or parachute pants. Should have gotten a large in these for a more authentic jogger fit. But due to the cut of the jeans you're still gonna have to wear them up by your belly button like the dude in the picture.
B001CJGL42|5|Lovely, soft, comfortable, and very professional looking.  Clinton Kelly and Stacy London would approve of this great little structured jacket.
B007NLX27M|5|Beautiful. Thank you!
B00KQXOJU8|5|I normally wear a med size top but chose to buy the size large.  It feels just right in the arms & length.<br />The color was charcoal that goes great with black slacks.<br />Thanks for the right price!
B00A8NOJKQ|2|I bought these because I already have a pair and they are very comfortable.  Ordered the exact same size and couldn't come close to buttoning them.  ???
B009YYZ55I|4|After reading reviews about colors being off and weird smells but loving the pictures, I hesitated on this one but decided to go for it. I ordered the beige, and I was worried it wouldn't be as &#34;dark&#34; as in the picture, but it's perfect! Nice deep browny-beige with dark fabric patches. Do not expect flawless craftsmanship (aka machine made), this is handmade and obviously so, but that is a big part of the charm. The waist, however, is quite tight so I had to knock off a star for that. I'd say if you wear 14 or more (I'm roughly a 12 I think) this will just be too tight on your waist. It's also not quite as full as I expected. Overall though, this is a beautiful, unique skirt that I'm sure will get a lot of compliments!
B00FBL7ZAQ|5|I wear this with black crop pants...fun!
B00EOPMZC8|4|Very comfortable.
B005FYNXGO|5|They fit, look great, and are comfortable.  Grey is great because I can wear them at work, while working out, or while wearing casual clothing.
B00BOV6B70|4|I was looking local to find rain coat to my kids I couldn't find any around I bought online and I am very happy
B00HSR7FU6|4|top part is too wide for my 8 year old boy, but bottom part is a little narrow. It was a little hard for him to breathe when he was performing at school.  Overall, he love it and the quality is okay.
B0009U6A50|5|I bought them for a gift and they are nice thick and they fit perfect
B00GG2B8GQ|5|I got the black dress with the gold zipper and its amazing, comfortable and sexy! It has specks of shine to it also. It unzips too so that makes it sexy ;) gives you a nice hourglass shape :) it enhances your curves too ;) great buy
B00KS6B3PM|5|My daughter loves her headband. Works well.
B006Z8G5GE|5|My husband likes the shirt.  It has a good feel and hand.
B0084XVJ3C|4|The Silver jean were just as I expected them to fit. Will most likely or them again. I would recommend them.
B00EDRE9J4|5|Love it!!!! It's so comfortable and it holds everything in!! Came faster than I expected!!!
B00OFOKPW0|2|It's sized wrong.  I can't get my hand in the sleeve; this semms to be more of a child' sweater than an adult.  I liked the color and the fabric.  Wish I could wear it.
B000NURBJK|5|These undies are so adorable, and according to my dh (aka Superman...lol), very comfortable...I would recommend buying them for the Superman in your life!!
B00939U4O6|5|I didn't think I could love sock it to me socks anymore... Then I found socks with sloths on them. These two things together is one of the best things I could ever ask for!
B000TJP2D2|5|I ordered these shirts because I work outdoors a lot and they provide good protection for all I am doing.  They were a little larger than I thought (I am terrible at guessing), but it worked to my advantage and I love them.  They are very well made with good material and, I am sure, will last me for a long time.
B00LMOSYTC|3|I didn't realize it was One Size Fits All. It's a little weird to make underwear that size! Anyway, it still seemed too big for OS.
B005NCBAKO|5|I got this item for my son, he like this kind of funny shirt, and he love it, he use it and its excelent
B00028B3G0|3|I wear a lot of Dickies pants and needed a red pair of pants for Holiday event so I ordered my normal 42x32 size. Read the other review and thought that I could still wear them since the normal 42x32s are somewhat loose in the waist. I couldn't even fasten these so I've ordered the 44x32 to see if those will fit. A lot of work for one night's wear. I'll probably return the first pair.
B00OGTQCLC|5|Super sexy
B00M7TYC3S|2|Low quality
B000P5AYDI|3|I wasn't expecting much from this product. The ears fit fine on my son...the velcro strap that goes under the neck wasn't sewn on very well and fell off immediately...
B00KBZO8UC|5|Good plain t-shirts, not as heavy as a standard t but not as light as an undershirt.
B00J5PY5VG|5|Ok so I love this robe so much I bought it in a few colors! I noticed the other reviews which was not my experience. its fits great! It is roomy which I like in a robe. Nothing worse than a tight robe. I suggest you buy it in a few colors in the beginning.
B00286AK1I|3|It is like an unlined bikini top, with a heavy (fabric covered) elastic band, about 1 inch tall, below the cups, around the chest.  It is not very stretchy and the elastic feels tight and constricting.  The fabric is a synthetic. I don't wear this.  I got several similar maternity/sleep style bras from JC Penney that are made of a t-shirt type of material, with a tiny bit of lace scalloping along the neckline and those are much more comfortable and fit me better.  I got those ones and this Majamas bra all in Medium and my pre-pregnancy clothing size was an 8-10.  The cup size and straps are ok, but the elastic band around the chest is uncomfortably stiff and restrictive and doesn't stretch enough when putting it on and taking it off.
B0078ZB2DO|5|Good!!
B00I11SM5U|5|I BOUGHT THIS WALLET FOR MY HUSBAND. THE LEATHER IS VERY SOFT, AND THE SIZE IS PERFECT. HE HAS HARLEY MOTORCYCLES AND RIDES A LOT, SO I THOUGHT THE WALLET WITH CHAIN WOULD BE A GOOD IDEA. I COULDN'T HAVE MADE A BETTER CHOICE. ANYWAY HE LOVES IT, AND SO DO I. THE QUICK DELIVERY WAS A PLUS..........
B004M5I4BQ|5|This package arrived on time as promised, it was neatly packed and at a price much less than any other site.  The quality of the t-shirt and the graphics were of excellent quality but most sites were ten it fifteen dollars higher.<br />I was very pleased with this order as was the recipient, my bank account was also pleased!
B00GKDWXVA|1|Had to return because this thing was so small.  I even have a small head and it wouldn't fit.  Wow
B00L69X8CQ|5|It fits well (not too poofy) and is flattering. I'm 5'6&#34;, 165lbs, size B cup and I ordered a Medium and I love the way it fits! :)
B00NC8A0QQ|3|This wallet is a lot of card slots which is a plus but the way they all fold together makes it quite combersome.  Different models may not be so thick.  The RFID blocking does work even blocks keycards I used to carry in my wallet to open doors at work.
B00CSIN946|2|Just not what I thought it would be. Once I get back from out of town I'm returning these. Same quality as underwear you can get at target. definitely not &#34;no rise&#34;
B00HO6JGTY|5|My daughter is about to be 5 but is the size of a 6 year old so I would say it is true to size.
B0009WMGZQ|5|The wallet is well made, with a very secure money clip in the fold. There are enough pockets for a couple of cards, ID, etc, w/o being bulky. I had a money clip style wallet that wasn't as well constructed and the money clip was basically a spring- loaded folding clip, not securely sewn into the wallet binding (like this one). The clip spring started to lose its tensioning and fell off, several times, until it finally fell off, lost for good.   This wallet's clip is integrated into the wallet construction and can't detach from the wallet, so cash is secure, but easily accessible.  Nice product for the $.
B00DHCE0K4|4|I wasn't sure what to expect but the design is really clever, the pouch is a separate item sown on to the main body of the brief, very nice feel to the fabric. Black and red go very well together, will buy this item again
B00QGPFK26|4|The actual shirt looks more purple than the picture.  But it still looks all right.
B0052OVAXA|5|I own several compression shirts from other brands which work well. This thing takes it to another level. I actually find this item easier to put on that any other compression t-shirts even though it's much firmer when you get it on, it's very tight but surprisingly comfortable. Overall, I am very happy.
B00F93GK8E|5|The gloves are just what was expected. They are long, like I wanted. Delivery seemed to take a long time, but was actually on the early side of the window that was given. It just felt longer in this age of  quick gratification.
B001RMO3NK|5|I was the typical guy Good looking always dressing amazing but having a huge wallet in my back pocket, with countless cards and worthless stuff I just kept cramming in there. I saw one of my co workers have one and I said \\"Gots to have dat!\\" So I made the purchase from the greatest online store in the world, and BAM! Got that ish in the mail. I really do love it. You can hold as many as 6 cards. The money clip will still hold just ONE. I am still getting adjusted to having nothing in my back pocket. I sometimes freak out and say \\"oh snap forgot my wallet what the eff happened to it??\\" Then thru the gods of Money I remember that its in my front pocket. hell ya. You also look like a Baller because you gots to keep dem fiftys and twentys on lock when you bust out dat money clip. WESTSIDE TILL I DIE!<br /><br />-CALIFORNIA
B00E8BPQCY|5|This robe is super soft, comfy and was such a hit with my tween daughter. She loves wearing it around the house and after she showers.  The pattern and design are super cute!  We love the color as well.
B00M8YWP54|3|Was excited to give this until I realized there were no shorts/bottoms included. DISAPPOINTED!!!
B0088YPUDM|3|The shirt material is very nice and durable. But this shirt is not a true 4 XL. I have a very deep chest and this shirt feels like I'm wearing a big flannel tube sock. This sucks because I love Carhartt. I have a lot of there gear. this just doesn't fit true.
B007OX0NGC|5|Great fit and is very comfortable.
B00Y3VZE0I|3|Runs a tad small and isnt very breatheable. Not that stretchy either. Was hoping for something a little more comfortable maybe lighter fabric.
B00CDJZ5Z6|4|The shirt is custom fit and not a slim fit. It Simply means if you have a belly like our friend WWCitizen, you have to go on a diet immediately. That is exactly what I am planning to do in order to avoid sewing these buttons on a daily basis. I hope to accomplish this mission in one month or two. The materials of the shirt is very soft in comparison to the many shirts that RG have on the market.
B00COPLO4K|5|Love this shirt
B006MJL6ZG|5|I purchased my first Undercover Mama tanks three years ago after the birth of my third child. I just recently bought two new ones after my last baby because I literally wore out the others with daily use! Here are my thoughts:<br /><br />I love that the tanks are longer than most nursing tanks, as well as made from a nice weight (95% cotton/ 5% spandex) material... They fit nice and snug which helps hold in a post partum figure and lie down smoothly under another shirt. I typically wear a 36B bra and weigh about 160 at 5' 8\\" and fit just right into a small top. You want it to fit snugly or the back slips down below your bra strap which is what eventually happened with my first pair. They were quite a bit looser after 2 years continual use and regular wash and dry. My new pair direct you to lie flat after washing, which may extend their elasticity a bit longer..... But I still got plenty of wear out of my old pair with no special care. I appreciate the addition of a rubber loop as well as a clip on the new tops..... The older style only had a clip and it didn't fit all of my bras well and would slip off.  I found that I like using both the clip and the rubber loop at the same time to keep everything where it should be.  The rubber loop alone slipped down my bra and lowered the neckline of the top, whereas the clip alone occasionally came off and fell below my bust line.<br /><br />I love these tops and wear them every waking moment while I'm nursing a little one. They are a necessity in my book for discrete nursing in public.
B00ESQWMQW|4|Would probably order true size, product is fitted, NOT 100% cotton so unlikely to shrink. Bought this as a gift.
B00BUFAMKM|5|The Doublju Mens Henley T-shirt was a gift for our grandson, and he loved it!!  He goes for style ... and this shirt seemed to fit the bill perfectly.
B0061U45JA|5|First time I can wear a hat that looks good. When you have a fat head you give up. Glad I found this!!
B002AQ4D3C|5|This was the first time that I bought pants online and since I currently have a pair of Dockers I wanted another but could not remember what I had bought (signature, no-iron or easy fit). but these turned out to be better than the ones that I currently have.<br />They fit great and will be ordering another pair shortly.
B002CNZQMU|5|This was a really good quality costume, very impressed when I received it. I normally wear a L/XL but went up as size since i find costumes tend to run small. It was perfect! not too tight, not too short.
B00MPFEVE4|3|The size is alright, but the fit is a little constricted in the legs for work pants. I want to be able to climb up and down things on the work site. Carhartt dungarees are surprisingly more versatile in that sense.
B007HBY1XW|5|It's cute, cute, cute!!
B00NNU30EM|5|Perfect for my grandson when he gets out of the pool.  Washed it and it did not shrink!  I sure like that fact.  For some reason it is hard to find children's bathrobes in brick and mortar stores.
B00BV4RQ7O|5|I was a little nervous about ordering this dress. It was so cheap so I was worried that when I actually got it, it would look cheap but it is more than I expected. I love it, it is gorgeous.
B00CI5JKUG|5|These are cute for the price.  A value.
B00EFLFHW6|5|I wear this jacket everyday commuting on my motorcycle and it is very comfortable, the leather is soft and with all of the vents is very breathable. I get a lot of compliments on the fit and the style of the jacket. Very glad I made this purchase.
B008FB9Z2U|3|I ordered these shorts early in order to get ready for Fourth of July at the beach and to ensure that everything fit well so when they came in I immediately tried them on.  The shorts do fit as expected around the waist however, the length is something I have an issue with - they run down to my upper calves.  I am by no means a tall person (5' 6&#34;) so I expect most shorts to run a little long but I bought these in medium and they were nowhere near an appropriate length.<br /><br />TL;DR: Pattern and material were great; waist was fit appropriately; length was way too long
B00SLXZUO4|5|Fit as described :)
B00N8FLET0|3|This is really cute but does not hold up to the trials of a 4 year old little girl.  She lost a button on the first day and I am having a hard time matching it.
B001F9R4YA|2|Ordered an extra small and its not the same as in the picture. its a v-neck and the back has nothing on it.
B000OQ3J6M|3|The pants are WAY too big.
B00IDIRKYA|5|Thank you
B00KBZQUBW|4|My husband has been needing shirts to wear under his polos for work. I had originally purchased some fruit of the loom at Walmart with less than hoped for results. These shirts on the other hand are perfect. They don't have that huge band on the sleeves which is good. And they are thin enough to not be bulky. I'm not sure how warm they would keep you being that thin but my husband is happy with them. They are a true to fit large but don't cling, they hang perfectly with room to move around in but not too much to look bunchy under another shirt.
B00IMTBJEM|1|Item was very much too small.  was a JOKE.  was more like a child size but not apropriate for a child!!
B003824RPG|5|My grandson loves Thomas and the underware has helped his potty training.
B0079AI3NU|4|This is a really cool shirt. It features most of the big bang theory cast, and makes it look like they are on a comic book cover.<br />If you are a fan of the show at all, this is a great shirt to own. My only complaint is the medium size is a little snug.
B00CD48GB6|4|I received this dress very fast. Ordered for a trip and was worried it would not show up in time due to the estimated shipping times but I got it in less than a week. Amazing. The material is very thin and I will have to do some sewing on the seams to ensure it will hold up when I wear it. I will also have to use clothing tape to tape the bottom into place as it rises alot when you move. And the material is very thin but the dress is very pretty and fits great.
B003V4AL06|5|Belt is exactly what I was looking for, a strong and durable belt.  I have had it for a week and it is holding up great.
B00I83DP1M|5|Very cool t-shirt. Young people think I belong to a cult and the 45 record center is the cult's symbol. I'm going to find some of the centers and hand them out.
B00MXZ53J8|4|it's a present , my friend like it ,but the colour 's a little different from the pic
B0048VJZJ4|4|but after one wash, it was a little short for me to say it's perfect.
B00KB6HJ4S|3|Really comfy, but the seam tore after just one wash.
B008O7V3WU|5|Good quality shirt.
B009QVKA0E|5|Everything was as represented, delivery, etc. just perfect...and the fit and fabric was really just what we wanted,, and launders well.
B00H1OBHTQ|5|This jacket is the cutest thing, I absolutely love it. I'm a size US xsmall so i ordered a large to stay on the safe side and it fits perfectly. The coat is extremely well made and super warm.
B005G87T82|5|Cute! I love buying hats for my son from these people. Shipping is expensive, but the hats are worth it.
B00HFXJX26|5|Very good item works with my Android HTC ONE VX. It's loud, does its job as ear warmers. I work in a freezer warehouse with loud equipment and it keeps me warm and i can hear my music pefectly clear.
B008N7ZKXY|5|A definite buy to add to your little one's wardrobe . The design is simple and chic . It is difficult to find good clothes for baby boys without having animal characters on them most of the time . So this is a good set to own.
B00NPC6GSU|5|Great fit and feel. Most comfortable.
B0009MZYF0|5|Got these socks for my husband.  These are his favorite socks because they have a lot of padding in the heel and toe.
B005CSNWEQ|5|Fit perfect & super comfortable! I own 5 pairs!
B00IUOAH5Q|5|My daughter loves them
B00LTN6K1A|1|Don't like it
B001HHXD5Y|5|I was dissapointed when I found out that they didn't have more styles for sale yet, because these guys really know what a quality product is. I encourage anyone who is looking for a suit to try them out. I usually buy suits for $400-$800 but I thought I would try out some less expensive items considering the tough times and all and sure was I surprised not only at the level of service but the craftsmanship. I called them up to ask about the company and they transfered to the online manager and he told me they supply suits to stores across the nation and even make suits for some of the biggest names in the industry. I really feel good that I found them.   Thanks Guys,
B002TZQAX0|4|Great product. Thank you. Well made and the color is beautiful. Makes a great gift. We bought for a birthday and it was a hit.
B0057U59RW|4|A little snug, but she likes them,  They look like the big girls Miss Me jeans. No problem with the material or fading.
B00KF7WGD2|1|It was too small and they refused to take it back.
B00570XBIG|4|Based on the sizing chart, my slim 14 year old is at the lower end of the scale for the 16/18 size. The 16/18 fit him perfectly. Unless your child is slim then I do not think that these boxers will fit. My son has slim legs and the legs are a snug fit. The quality of the fabric is not as thick as mens CK underwear but it is soft and okay for the price.
B0083EDNEA|1|I ordered a L/XL. When it came it was labeled as such, however, should have been labeled XS, as I could barely get into them, even though they were rated my size. Had to return. Had ordered 2 pairs, returned both, only got refund for one pair (a refund I'm still waiting for).
B00EKT1M18|5|Tried this on and I was surprised at how well it fit. I am 5' 10&#34; tall and 200 lbs. The material has some stretch to it.
B0037Y04HA|5|This boa put the amazing final touches on my halloween costume.  Great feathers and it doesn't shed like the cheap ones you buy in the store.  Great product at a great price!
B00E5ROALY|5|Looks & feels fine very happy
B00DS0ETXS|1|SIZE DID NOT CORRESPOND !!!!<br />SIZE DID NOT CORRESPOND !!<br />FEEL VIOLATED TO PAY GOOD PRICE YET BE MISLED<br />SAD YOU DO NOT STAND BY THE PRODUCTS
B00CT9TMX6|4|Fit my son great
B001104BZS|2|Very baggy overall, looks very slouchy look.  Too full  in hips and legs. Fabric is nice and jeans are well made.
B00CEPZB6C|4|not long enough, but fit
B00C0PEPAY|3|Product is somewhat flimsy, the design is just  painted  on but it does the trick
B00J9UGCWM|5|These shirts are beautiful, no wrinkling, cool and fit nicely.  They make casual look dressy.
B008HHMC40|4|These fit great, very comfy. I like the colours as well. I am very happy with this purchase. Will buy again.
B004OVELWY|4|Very good product and size is wonderful and tough to find in the retail stores.
B00A42E72Q|5|This scarf has been great, it keeps me nice and warm and feels really soft. It seems that many scarves are too short to wrap around your neck and still hang down past your collar bones, but this scarf doesn't have that problem. I can wrap it around a couple times and still have ends that hang town at least 12 inches, which leaves plenty of room still to loosen it up and still have the ends hang down enough that it won't unwrap and fall off.
B00NFIZ8SS|5|Hanes is always my number one pick for men's and boys underwear. They are always comfortable and will always recommend them to other persons.
B00NUI01NA|5|Perfect fit, and feel, very feminine! I again like the color choices :)<br /><br />A must buy for those ladies who love leggings
B00HFFJF54|5|I really wanted a affordable but warm jacket! I've been searching for either Northface or Columbia jacket and since I am a tiny person this Large girls fit perfectly! Just in time for snow tubing this weekend!
B0006I3V6Q|5|Love these panties!  Been buying them for years.  Fits like they were made for me.<br />Highly recommend them.
B00OX9I8SU|5|Love the socks
B00FM9KN3I|5|It is difficult to find any Chelsea items here in Dallas, TX and I was apprehensive about ordering a hat online (I'm picky about how they fit) but in this case it worked out fine.  I'm really satisfied with the order and love the hat!
B000Q8H284|5|This works great to get that fullness to the dress of a princess.  It has held up to many dress up sessions.
B00AE0DVSE|5|I bought these for my 2.5 month old boy even though they all says &#34;girls shorts&#34;. I really wanted shorts that weren't loose fitting. The quality is super nice and they fit him great (I bought 6 mo ones and he's 12.5 lbs, 25 inches). I will defiantly buy more sizes and he grows out these! I've washed and dried them a bunch already and they wash up good. Really happy I found these.
B00AFRC2EU|4|As expected
B00UHG4FDK|5|Love this suit thinking about ordering in another color!
B00BBS8KTS|5|Great hoodie, but I ruined mine within 16 hours of receiving by getting paint on it.<br /><br />I ordered another to replace it.
B004P2LHZ6|3|Does the job, but I gave it a 3 out of 5 because I feel the metal buckle looks and feels very cheap.  Fortunately, I had also purchased the Flip-Top Buckle Fabric Belts on Amazon by a seller CTM, which was constructed much better.  You can find those belts here: http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000EANUUS/ref=cm_cr_ryp_prd_ttl_sol_28
B00JO8YVF4|5|I just got this item today (8/06/2014). I ordered my sweater in an Asian XXL which is XL in American sizes and it fits snug, but that so because of the soft jersey material.  But for me I like my clothes to fit, I have never worn my clothes baggy, I am to much of  a prep for that. The material is great! And it looks just like the picture. I am 6 ft 6 inches at 205 lbs and the sweater is long enough for my height and sits below the small of my back. It actual covers soon of my rear end as well. I feel that as time goes on the sweater with loosen and actually fit great.  As in mold to your body and become  a one of a kind fit. I love clothes that do that!  I would buy from the company again and that is saying something, online shopping is a hit or miss for a tall person. You pretty much have to try the clothes on to see if it will work.<br /><br />Owh and the shipping was supper fast. My item came from Seoul, Korea and it arrived within 2 days thanks to DHL.
B00EFASXQE|4|Very cute dress!!! IT looks exactly like the picture. The only complaint I have is that the built in bra is disgusting and looks just like the picture. You can see the cups and it looks really weird. It is also sewn in, so it's not meant to come out. But I snipped it out with scissors, and sewed the material back and it looks fab without it. The dress is waaay more metallic in appearance than in the picture. After I cut the gross, unnecessary cups out, the dress was very flattering. The back and the waistline are the same completely see through material, but it's very pretty. If you are handy with a needle and thread, I totally recommend getting this dress!!! I'm 5'5 hour glass shape, C--cups and got the medium. It fit perfectly!!!!
B00H8OUXYO|4|I like my new suit, love the color, fits fine.
B00FYVXO26|4|Great shirt! Not upset that the shirt is a little larger than I expected! Usually they are much smaller so pleasantly surprised. : )
B00FC1ZQJC|4|Soft, nice color. The boyfriend fit makes it a bit wide. I would order one size down.
B00BJOFIGC|2|Bought the Medium for my wife and it is very loose.  She wore it once when I asked her to try it on and has not worn it since.
B00WO7OWBA|4|Great shirt!!!
B007K9A2AW|5|You get what you pay for (most of the time anyway), but it certainly applies to these boxers by CK.  Nice wide waistband with soft knit cotton material.  They are traditional boxers and fit loosely.  They are NOT boxer-briefs!  Have already washed them several times and they appear to be holding up very well.
B004MUK85Q|5|I originally intended to buy this pouch as either a wallet or coin purse, but I ended up using it as a pen/pencil pouch for college.<br /><br />It has a really cute design, (I love birds) and I have gotten lots of compliments on it!
B00UWW5XR6|1|I am really annoyed with what I just received! the top is just a strap of fabric! Yup.....all it is, is a long strip of cut fabric. I could have went to any fabric store and bought a strip of fabric and got the same thing this seller sent to me. its not even cropped at the edges so with a few washes it will get frayed. What is even more annoying is that there are no directions. I'm supposed to just look at the picture here online and figure it out? Terrible, just terrible. NEVER again will I purchase from this seller. My first awful experience at amazon. VERY disappointed, waste of time and money. The bottoms however fit as expected. A lot of people say it runs small but I've been having problems finding bottoms that fit right. I tried large at Walmart and they were tight, I think large there is like a 12-14. The next size I tried at Walmart was the xl which is 16-18 but those were too large! My pant size is between a 12 and 14 and these bottoms fit perfectly and I am big in the hips and butt. I'm just really pissed off about the top. Who in their right minds as a merchant just sends someone a piece of fabric and expects the consumer to just figure it out. Really really ticked off. also do NOT buy the white one!!! its see through!!! everyone will see your nipples when it gets wet!!!! just great! hey kiddos at the water park, check my nipples out! SERIOUSLY! this seller sucks!!!! RIP OFF!
B00O4G7Y6O|2|Only giving 2 stars because of the fit.  Product was delivered on time and the person I gave it to really liked the hat, but I had to return because it was too small.
B004S0DUCS|5|I got this in a US medium which I tend to wear.<br /><br />It's a little snug and tends to ride up a little bit.<br />If you wear a medium I'd recommend getting a large in this sweater.<br />Other than that it looks great and is very warm.
B000XZTJX6|5|:)
B00ENLMPL4|5|I had low expectations for the price. I just wanted something to cover up between house and hot tub. Does the trick just fine. Not suited for warmth. It's simple 100% cotton. Seems to be stitched just fine.
B00AMAC3IU|4|Cute graphics.  Reminds me of Hawaii with the ocean theme to the shirts.  The outfits are well made and fit my grandson well
B002QRCMTW|2|Why would a medium belt made to fit 34-36 inch waist be 41 inches long?? The belt is OK, actually good quality,  but the overhang is  8 inches. I'm not happy about having to pay to send it back.<br /><br />Pat
B00M8TOUWU|4|Very nice quality
B007729FMI|5|Extremely comfortable!  I wish all of my undies were just like these! They fit just like they are supposed to.
