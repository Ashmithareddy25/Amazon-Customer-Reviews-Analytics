B005JZD6KM|5|I use this for my daughters car seat. It is perfect! I can click her in quickly without having to search for the seatbelt. Saves time and back pain.
B003YCZ1F0|3|I'm not really sure why it's advertised that it does. The mounting system is completely different on the SMH5. I figured maybe it came with some sort of adapter but it doesn't.
B000U3BS6W|4|Its the best aftermarket siren I've com across.
B00REE95YC|5|Great and had no problem
B003YJ8TVQ|1|Literally burst into flames in my car. Enough said.
B00AW82TQS|4|Pretty bright but two of the panel didn't work great if they under dash
B00ZU0UBP4|5|Fit good and gave the truck a whole new look. 2004 3500.
B007T0EOY2|5|They look great and easy to install
B00CPL8WY8|5|This treatment has fixed 3 of my vehicles that has a front main seal seepage.Saved me a bunch of time and $$$. If you have a main seal weeping or leaking, try this product. If it works be happy...

B000BRJQ9S|5|high quality, work perfectly on my boat engine cover
B000VUC3QI|5|as described
B00DSGGBG0|5|everything ok
B000EQVMZC|3|If the tires are in good shape do not apply.  If the tires are old or off road tires on a jeep or truck it helps.  If I had a sports car or luxury car I would not apply.
B005DV9ICC|4|Very nice lights. Seem to be of good quality but haven't got them mounted yet, figure a off season project.
B008SEBQ2G|5|I wish auto manufacturers would employ at least one designer/engineer who has ever lived somewhere that the temperatures get below freezing. This antenna resolved the issue of trying to wash, or scrape frost from a windshield while trying to straddle the antenna with my arms. It works beautifully with no discernible difference in reception.
B004ZC3TFC|5|Love it, works great&#34; it was better than expected.
B007CDF90O|3|Good quality but a little too small where the pegs go into the holes.<br />Very comfortable.
B00B2HM4UE|4|i like so far
B001C6NL52|5|Work perfectly
B00A2DWOJK|5|This cover is made from good heavy material,it will last longer than the cheap,thin ADCO covers that I purchased in the past,that don't last a season.I will be purchasing a Goldline Cover for my truck camper also,in the future.
B001UCGHWM|5|Exact replacement, works good so far.
B004MBS7CQ|4|These screws arrived a little later than I expected. They do look great with my license plate.
B00GI2IJTI|5|Arrived much earlier than expected! Not only were instructions included, but two practice decals! Plus, a gun shooting panda, just hurry up and buy already!
B00A93TLQW|5|Good stuff
B00L1RUUZQ|5|They fit and look great.
B00IR90I7Q|5|First things first - the picture and some of the description is ambiguous as to whether one or two - You get one for your order of one &#34;set&#34;. n As that is all I was expecting, I am OK.<br />I bought this as a replacement for a dead ECCO backup alarm.  I thought it would be a simple swap, but it was not.  The reason is that the posts on the Federal are much smaller (about #6) and more closely spaced than the ECCO, (about #12 - 7/32) so all my electrical connectors had to be replaced to a smaller size.  So a couple of minute job turned into an hour job working under the vehicle and playing with wires in a tight place.<br /><br />Sound is loud enough and a bit on the higher pitch than the ECCO.  Further observation, the posts appear to offer a lesser profile for water intrusion as it transitions to the epoxy block as compared to the dead ECCO.  But only time will tell if that observation is correct.
B00KCP7NEY|5|PERFECT FIT
B000AM8B1I|5|good stuff.
B000LVBQD8|4|Good but the locking clip did not slide on so easily.  Crazy to think that a set of wipers cost as much a basic car tire.<br />Once on the seem to work well.  We'll see how well the do in the winter.
B00KJ1E2DQ|5|LOVE IT
B00FIOLKFW|5|great price just like original but much cheaper
B009UKUURO|5|WOW!! NICE MACHINE! UPDATE WHEN I USE IT MORE. BUT.... WOW!!!!
B0042XORMI|5|Great item
B0012WHBSO|5|Man, this thing is great. It has saved our rear a couple times already in the short time we've had it. A couple unlucky tire punctures have allowed us to test this thing out a few times. It fits nicely in the back of our Sorento under the cargo area. I like that it comes with a generous power cable and a built in PSI gauge. Also comes with a few extra adapters for different tire applications. It is kind of slow to fill the tire, to add 20 PSI to our Sorento's tire, it takes maybe a couple minutes or so. But its very compact, which is nice for hiding it away until needed. Nice peace of mind to have this in the car.
B005ESHUGK|3|They(pkg of 2) don't hold their shape very well, but they do keep brace from rubbing the skin.
B007WQQNQA|5|A++ fine tool
B008DREON6|5|Easy to install with plenty of 'storage. Has elastic straps which fit my car very well.
B00K75UFWQ|4|Fits my Camaro  good

B000E35UXA|5|So far so good. Had a little problem plugging In the yellow connector but after spreading the pin receivers a bit, it finally attached tightly.
B00XO0NTYM|5|Great quality sticker. My husband was super happy with it!
B000CMH8UG|3|Probably good for other applications, but not for minivans.<br /><br />I bought 3 rolls of this stuff to try and black out the rear windows on my minivan.  (Everything behind the driver and passenger windows.)<br /><br />I did watch the youtube video.  My chances of getting an installation without it were about zero.<br /><br />I also bought the installation kit.  Invaluable.  Don't try it without the kit.<br /><br />Okay, the problems:<br /><br />1.  The geniuses at Gila, when taping the roll shut, use a gigantic sticker that says &#34;Gila&#34; on it.  At a minimum, this ruins about a square foot of the tint.  Maybe more.  BUT... if you don't notice it and start trimming to your window size, it causes you to throw away the piece you are trimming and have to start again with a new piece.  That ruined 1 entire roll in my case.<br /><br />2.  Note that in the installation video, they point out that you can't use this stuff on rear windows because it doesn't handle compound curves.  Well.. it doesn't handle the compound curves of a minivan window, either, near as I can figure.  So, that's that.  While trying to keep straightening out the large bubbles, I creased a piece.  That was another half-roll.<br /><br />3.  I was thinking that maybe it would work once the side that is on the sticky stuff is taken off.  The stuff is thinner, then.  Maybe if you press the adhesive to the glass, it would work.  But, when I took off the protective side, the sticky side stuck immediately to the film, ruining yet another piece.  I don't fault the product, itself, but if I tried again, I'd start wetting down the adhesive side, as I was removing the protective layer.<br /><br />4.  A faulty trimming job in the last remaining piece meant that out of 6 potential pieces that could have covered a window, I had zero.  On the bright side, I had one window that was immaculately clean.<br /><br />I can see how the product would be awesome.  If you see the video, you see an example of how it could.  Hey, why not.  But you'll also notice, they only show it being applied to a driver or passenger side window that can be rolled up and down.<br /><br />I think for other windows, it gets far more complicated.  It can still be done, but if the window has compound curves (curves from top to bottom and side to side), there's a possibility that it won't work at all.<br /><br />Now, I've seen some folks jump on guys who say this stuff is hard to work with.  I would say it isn't easy.  On a scale of 1 to 10, it's a 6 or so.  Not impossible by a long shot.  Once you get good with it, probably not that bad.  But for the typically adept do-it-yourselfer, if you make a small mistake (and you can't avoid them without bumping into them and learning by experience a few times), you will absolutely ruin a piece of film.<br /><br />Now, on the positive side, these criticisms:<br /><br />1.  I didn't think the roll was too short.  If not for the other problems, it was enough to do an entire side of a minivan.<br /><br />2.  I didn't think the film was too thin.  I don't know if other film is thicker and more elastic or what.  If so, it would be nice.  But nothing comes close to this price point at all.<br /><br />Would I try this project again?  Not on your life.  It can be done, but there's a lot of art to this.  Best left to a shop that does tint.
B00C6R1P6I|5|Like most OTC tools, this works as described. However, ours is rarely used. Instead, we use a 3/8 impact gun to remove the plugs on 5.4 3V engines. To date, we've had a 100% success rate at removing plugs without breaking them.
B00HD9UUXS|5|It is a great product that matches the original.
B00M6T9LGM|1|cheap
B00K6974EU|3|I installed the T20 on my brake, reverse and blinker for my 2003 Lexus LS430. The LED lights are working properly however, my dashboard shown failure on my taillights and blinker. The blinker now flashes super hyper as it doesn't recognize the LED bulbs. I replaced all my interior lights with LED bulbs T10, T6 and BA9S purchased from different Amazon seller with no problem. The only way to fix this bulb failure is either replace the LED bulbs with OEM bulbs or install a diode or load capacitor. I ended up taking out the brake and blinker replacing it with OEM.  Updated 2015.08.16:  I updated my rating from 1 star to 3 stars after discussing the issue with the seller in which they will discuss the issue with their supplier to improve the quality of their product offering. I told them that I'll keep the 2 of the 4 pairs ordered since i can use 1 pair for my back-up light and the other pair as a spare, and they will refund me the costs of the 2 pairs.
B000C5UFVM|5|Worked perfect!
B00KQ131A4|5|Perfect! Very much appreciated!
B000C5BA3O|5|As expected. 1990 Bayliner Capri 2050CX Alpha One Gen One outdrive. Note, do not glue the exhaust bellows onto the outdrive! It will slip off so just clean the surfaces, attach the two stainless clips to the bellows and clamp it on. Everything worked perfect, good quality.
B002P8QKAY|5|With the help of Youtube it was installed with no problems and saved a bunch by not going to the dealer.
B00KCRX2BK|5|Looks wonderful
B00INTKTRE|4|Has all your basic needs
B006H34BUY|4|Works fine and is soft.
B0010E1LYY|5|good
B00NALMLPS|5|awesome product! installed these on the outside of my car in a vent and wired them to my turn signals. Highly recommend this product. If you are using this for automotive, be sure to give a few days for the adhesive side to heat and cool to really bond. i made the mistake of washing my car the next day and one started to peel off. easy fix though i just ordered some double sided tape and slapped it on there. had them for a few month now with no issues.
B00I84J50Q|5|Very sturdy and well made cats toys.  The cats are very much enjoying them.  Thank you!
B0009JKI6I|4|good but not the best last about three months and had to replace.
B003AP95SU|5|Just as expected, this jack is for real and unique.
B0002JMUY8|3|OEM quality. Did not fit on my 1996 F350 7.3
B0002U2V1Y|5|The clay bar works well. Nice quality, thick, micro fiber towel included. The detailer spray was just enough to do an entire compact SUV, including all the windows. Overall good product.
B000CEYVAY|5|looks great. just as good as oem.
B00TUJVYE8|5|fits good easy to install
B00B9EVOQA|5|Exact fit and great price
B00JIJ4LWW|5|Great product and results
B0041CG0P2|5|Worked great to balance my rim locks.
B0087QXWRM|5|WELL WORTH THE MONEY !!
B000J3ZRPQ|4|Works great when you don't use the vehicle more than once a day.  It's a struggle to get it around the rear view mirror.  I surrendered and bent it on both sides of the mirror slot so that it would go on without such  a struggle.  So when driving to multiple places I keep a smaller spring style  for everyday use.  This I use when I park the Bronco for the entire day.
B00NON2332|5|Great Product, good feel to it but doesnt really fit 41mm forks got to bend them a bit but for the price its great quality,
B00V4049K2|1|Did not work for me. Bought a car from a smoker and used this to see if it would help and it did not.
B0007LCZ14|5|Works great
B00RGZWIW0|5|Great product!
B0012WU1L8|5|Good shocks
B00VMS0Q9O|5|Looks great and works great only thing is the blue light stays on 24/7
B00197JVN0|2|I need to return this, it doesn't fit correctly. I've been to 3 body shops and they all confirmed it would be hundreds of dollars to make fit.  People say &#34;fitment is 9 out of 10&#34; I would have to honestly say it's a 0 out of 10 because it DOESN'T fit right... the holes are drilled slightly off, so it just doesn't fit, would need to grind my OEM hood hinges which I WONT do
B00BN46XX0|2|I gave this two and not one because customer service was GREAT. However, the keychain looks nice but is not worth $10.00. I had it two days and it fell apart in my pocket. I would return it but they had sent me the wrong one to begin with and the one I returned fell apart in my hands. I decided to keep the bottom half and just use it as a regular keychain instead of a two piece chain.
B000VKTUD2|5|Replaced the old filter in my 2007 Prius in 5 minutes, and it fit just fine. Saved me 2/3 the cost that the mechanic at the dealership would have charged me for them to replace it.
B00PXC5PNC|5|This Jeep fuel door was exactly what I was looking for. It came with mopar instructions and looks just like the authentic one (not sure if this one is authentic but it is identical). The price is a lot less than what I have seen. The only thing that is wrong with the door is there is a peg on the top of the back of it that pushes against my sheetmetal and causes it to stick out a bit on the top, I have a 2015 JK so others might be different but this is something to look out for when you are installing it.
B001XUD46S|1|The tab that close to side mirrors sticks out and not letting my window close all the way. My window goes up automatically and it hits the tab and makes the window go back down.
B00FQ0ROZS|4|ThEy make great work lights on my flatbed
B004JO3SZ2|4|the only thing I wish was that one could buy one mat one mat instead of the full set.
B00OY40LNE|5|Great seat lots of grip while riding .
B00NXRXO0U|5|Have read a mix of reviews. Been on for two weeks now. No problems.  I'd buy again.
B00QU88LHU|1|The part didn't work and they said they don't replace parts.
B00MS93F2G|5|Looks great on my VW Golf!
B00GOUJ7VI|4|The fender flares look good and fit well.
B002E5FOR8|5|This item and a youtube video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKvCuwIVz_4) did the trick to replace the A/C blower motor in a Prius.  Just make sure when you're putting the plastic drip pan back together you notice the little part in the front that has to snap together in order to make the entire drip pan snap back together and allows the screws to line up.  A/C working again!
B0013F3FNA|1|Great fit easy to put on
B00F5MUB66|5|it's great to take a good shower now.
B00FGLJNSI|3|Cuts your f%$%ing hand when you use them
B00P8ZAR6E|5|very please. Super bright and would definitely buy another one. Awesome for the price. Again very pleased!!
B005D1A1NC|5|Was just what I thought and paid for, thanks!
B00XM43M1U|5|Nice looking and sturdy
B0079MKKZC|4|Made well and easy to install.  Looks great and covers up that ugly clutch linkage.  I wish they had included the metric alan wrench required to install  it.  It would have only added a few cents to the cost but saved me a lot of aggravation.
B001KQD7NU|1|Item broke after less than 3 months of use.  The manufacturer is terrible to work with.  Spent over 2 hours getting resolved only thanks to Amazon.
B002UD0GFE|5|Great stuff for cleaning polycarbonate or acrylic.  I use it on my motorcycle wind shield.  No haze or streaks.
B00OO25M0S|3|Quality so so.
B000IZ1RPY|5|Replacement for original parts on caliper. OEM  replacement and not as expensive as priced at the dealership
B00030BFQA|5|The charger was every thing that I expected. It's done exactly what was advertised . A great charger for the money.
B00PR2L352|3|Good kit, but I had a few issues. My 234w LED light bar pulls more current, apparently, than this is rated for. The wires get too hot to touch within minutes of having the bar on. I'm at the hardware store purchasing better wire now.<br />  Also, the very cool looking switch is too large to fit in any of the holes on my 11 4runner, so I'll have to replace that also.  All in all, I learned how to do a light bar wiring install, but this would not be a good fit for me and my vehicle in the future.<br /><br />  Just make sure it fits your application, and you'll be good to go.
B00VB2OKG6|5|It's great
B0002JM9NU|5|Some reviews mentioned that they received a different bucket than what is in the picture however the one I received was exactly like what was in the picture. This is just a bucket, not a ton to say about it however its sturdy and good quality, I can pick up the bucket when its full with water and it doesn't feel like its going to fall off of the handle or break at all. I would recommend this bucket - its nice a big and I'm easily able to fit a large sponge in it without any issues.
B001GH3QSO|5|Work good, makes truck look awesome!
B000AR7KVA|5|I used this rubbing compound to lighten up foggy headlights and it works but it won't take off the fog if the headlight lenses are extremely foggy but it did make an improvement.
B004A6JA2O|4|Easy to install and well made at a fraction of the cost of what the dealer charges.  The carbon element is embedded well into the filter so there aren't any specks falling off of it to make a mess.  As far as the smell filtering aspect, i've not noticed a difference yet but will test it with different smells such as hot foods and teenage boys carpool as school starts up again.  I'll update this review after these tests.
B000Z0HVHA|4|worked great
B00KTIUG5C|5|all i needed was the rubber buttons on the inside, but for the money, i will take the whole package
B00NJK9O3C|5|The Bosch 40324 wiper blade is similar to the initial stock wiper installed on the Honda. Prior to this one, I'd been using a triple bladed one. Living in the Pacific NW, there is typically a lot of call to use wipers. Receiving this, seeing that it was a thin, single blade, I did not expect to be very impressed. Installation went smoothly - pops right on, actually much quicker than the more expensive brand that was installed. They work really well in the rain, quiet, with no squeaking or streaking. They handled heavy rain well.
B000CSOLWI|5|1999 VW new Beetle with 247862 Miles on it. runs like its a brand new car . Perfect OEM replacement. Power was restored and no more engine check light or fouled out plugs. @ 1/4 the price of what the dealer wanted.
B002UC8MJW|5|Just what I needed
B005G5R1Y2|5|Exactly what I want wanted.
B004I0ZPXA|5|Easy to install and looks just like the original.
B00S1ZS5NU|5|Was exactly what I wanted.  Took some time to set it up but it looks great. And yes it fits 2.0 engine.
B006EFU1XQ|5|excellent, very good
B00GMTAS0U|5|Looks awesome .
B005ASY23I|5|Have not used the compressor to fully pump up a tire (car has 17&#34; wheels with high-profile tires) but after a brief test found the unit very quiet (did not require hearing protectors) with a smooth running motor. The gauge does not seem that accurate while running but once the unit was turned off the gauge settled down and was pretty good. But I carry a separate tire pressure gauge anyway.  Oct 2015 update. Used the compressor while on trip. The unit worked flawlessly and quietly. The air pressure gauge was spot on. I like that the hose screws securely on to a tire's valve.
B000YE194I|5|I have 3000 miles on this hub assembly and it is performing flawlessly. Good product at a good price.
B003V57NUQ|4|I recommend this rack to anyone who wants a good, inexpensive rack.  These work very well at a great price.  I have them mounted on a Yakima round (tubular) rack and my only complaint is they can't be tightened down enough so they won't roll/tilt on the rack.  When a kayak is on the rack and strapped down though this is not an issue at all.
B00JG74H20|5|These fit GREAT and make the underside of the truck look much cleaner and keep debris off the frame rails and other gear.  I have these on a 2015 F250 Super Crew and was always bugged about how the rear wheel wells looked unfinished and had a bunch of unused holes around the wheel well area. Now it looks finished LIKE FORD SHOULD HAVE DONE. Anyway, you will be happy.  I recommend removing the rear wheel to make this job much easier.  I would not even attempt it with the wheel on. NOTE: If you are also installing the Husky splash guards like I did - put this on FIRST and install fasteners at the same time as the shields.
B00MJZVQ34|3|This definitely looks cool but I put it on a black jeep. The problem is the form tape used on the back is white so it shows against the black of the jeep and the piece itself. Not the end of the world... I'm sure it will will collect dirt and dust and darken soon enough.
B0031HC8PY|4|Good fit, hope it lasts longer than my previous one from another company.
B009B8V7ZO|5|HEAVY DUTY and matched color of Hummer2 perfect; Glacier Blue. Fast shipping arrived in excellent condition.
B00C2FIFIU|4|works
B002P8H7QU|5|Perfect fit for my car. Looks great.
B001S80ZHG|5|Bought this when my wiper transmission broke. Easy to install once you read up how to access it. Would buy this again if it breaks again.
B000CQUOYO|3|does not fit properly on a 1999 dodge ram as posted it would connectors don't fit well
B00F8FT6CA|3|shortrer  than I expected. about half the size of factory antenna
B00F5MUB66|5|Sticks out away from the wall more than I would have hoped for but otherwise this shower head works great.
B003YLKLD8|5|Worked perfectly and I was able to install it myself.
B0022ZX616|5|looks great
B005G541B8|5|Bought this to replace an 8 year old Interstate battery in my 1981 Virago XV750. Fit was perfect in the box and it rolls the engine over much faster than the one it is replacing.<br /><br />Only issues I had is that if you still have the factory original ground strap on your bike, you'll have to slightly &#34;tweak&#34; the end by modifying the angle of it with a pair pliers. The ground strap is literally an 1/8&#34; short (this battery is about an 1/8&#34; taller than factory). I'm sure the tolerances on something like this was super high back in 1981, so your mileage may vary. The other issue, is the plastic mounting bracket that holds the battery in on top has fingers that were designed to intermingle with the trough where the fill caps would be on a normal battery, these will have to be ground off as there is no actual &#34;trough&#34; or fill caps on these batteries.
B00GOR6G0G|1|motor plug does not fit all models of this vehicle. be sure and pay close attention to the window motor plug..
B00408W4OS|5|right part!!! great price!!!  perfectly replaced the one i broke
B0050VFAOK|3|Was a little flaky for me.  Used in the back seat of a Honda Pilot.  I had to constantly jiggle it to get it connected.  It did help me do some work in the car, though, while my wife drove.  So, it helped, but I wish it was more stable.  Pretty loud as well.
B00BGZ1WCS|3|Item arrived as described. It was purchased for the latest standard GM FOB and fits fine, however, once on I realized that there isn't  an opening on the back side that allows you to see the vehicle seal on the FOB (ie Cadillac/corvette/GMC).
B000CIY15A|5|Awesome product. Actually aluminum diamond plate center.
B0013RGR56|5|Solid, delivered quick and well made.
B00SZK26T0|4|These bulbs are good for non-functional foglights.  Other reviews were correct that the light produced is definitely not 700 lumens.  However, the color is 5000k and matches my 5000k HIDs.  For a plug and play set of LED's and for the price these are good.  Had them in for a little over a week and no problems and do seem to be a quality build.  The first pic is daytime comparison between these LED's to the OEM bulbs on the right.  Note, it was day time so of course neither bulb was appeared that bright.  The second picture I took with my lowbeams on because they took away from the &#34;brightness&#34; of the led's.  I would probably buy these again but not for headlights.
B00DZI4IAW|3|I wish they had more options in size but I love the design and i would definitely buy if they had more size options
B00R3ZKRB2|5|This fits into my 2015 CRV LX AWD perfectly. The color also matches.
B001AIZ5HY|5|Made an amazing difference. Some tips for potential buyers:<br />- I went ahead and pulled my headlights off of my car so that I could get a better handle on them while sanding, made things MUCH easier and more comfortable to deal with the awkward curvature of the lense.<br />- Keep in mind the instructions are clear about not putting too much pressure while sanding - this is for good reason. Pressing too hard will sand faster, yes, but it can also cause smear (which the instructions clearly warn about) and even possibly burn right through the sand paper and damage your headlights even more. So just do as they instruct: light to medium pressure and make a LOT of passes.<br />- Every single step that instructs you to go to a new grit has a part that states that more time spent on each step will give you a better result in the end. They state this over and over because the quality of this product depends on the quality of the labor you invest in using it. Be patient and diligent. Anticipate putting 2+ hours into this.<br />- If you have yellowing on your headlights, be sure you know and memorize where it is before you start sanding. You will need to make a lot of extra passes with the lower grit paper to get rid of this, but it becomes difficult to see where the yellowing is once you begin.<br />- It gets worse before it gets better: the lower grit papers make your headlights look very white and cloudy, but it's supposed to. Once you get to the higher grits you will start to see it clear up and then the polish will show you why you just spent hours on this little project.<br />- Speaking of the polish: you can be generous with the stuff. Do as instructed (a dime size at a time) but don't keep buffing once that bit of polish is gone, you don't want that buffing pad to be dry when it's spinning against your newly restored lens, so keep adding more until you're satisfied.
B006B80JSS|5|K & N makes amazing products. I buy an air filter for every vehicle I own. Smoother engine and a little more pep is well worth the price. Put one of these in your vehicle and never worry about your air filter again.
B003CH3Z8W|4|For those of you looking for a replacement full time backing plate, this is not it. It is a excellently engineered artwork when it comes to polishing in tight spots or waxing over dips and corners. However, This pad is not made for highspeed paint correction work. The long angled edge causes a rippling effect when used at speeds above 4k opm (when used with a DA). Being the pad is attached to it, guess what else wants to jump off the paint! This isn't that big of a deal, other than you're not getting the full effect of the paint correction you could with a less angled plate that would hold the outer most edges of the pad down on the pain. You're going to lose about a inch or so of the effective surface of the pad. Once again, i'm not knocking this pad. It is very well made. It just serves it's own purpose and not intended for FULL TIME paint correction. Its also a pain to pull the pad off it. The edge is so flimsy, the plate bends back when you try to pull them off and you literally have to work it off. On a good note, you don't have to worry about the pad flying off.... IT WON'T.
B0006I0MXG|5|Exactly!  And quick !
B0015DQ81G|5|as an insurance auto estimator I take tire depth measurements all the time and need to record them on camera.  This works very well for me
B00C80HSU0|3|Does the job at a nice price but you can defiantly tell it's not the most quality of builds
B0016WIWTC|5|Was very easy to install.  Removed the tailgate access cover and one nut from lock assembly added the provided washers (spacers) slipped the assembly onto the stud over the washers and installed the provided Nylock nut.  You will need something to fish the harness through the bottom of the tailgate other than that it was just ziptying the cable down as you run it to the cab and connecting it to the proper wires.
B00B3UXQ2U|5|I paid $35 for one can of adhesion promoter at my local PPG paint store.  That can just sputtered and spit.  For about the same price, I get a six pack and they spray perfectly.  Just finished re painting a set of Cadillac bumper covers with excellent results.
B001DRI5LA|5|2008 yaris fit great great price will buy again when needed
B00C8UPXLQ|2|May be great for cars, but oversize off road tires not so much. Beads take several miles to &#34;settle in&#34; and until then you have to deal with vibration and wobble. Then any little bump sets them out of balance and you have to go through it again. I have tried to find a &#34;tech&#34; department to no avail.
B0075VE936|5|Exactly the same as the OEM filter.
B00JA3BMDW|5|Works as described.
B005JU5ZYC|5|Best in class, at least in the tropics (Dominican Republic).
B006X98A7C|5|Hard to describe beyond it works....
B00RJND71K|5|Great product and it was a perfect fit
B00KGIDT54|4|No problems so far been running ski a lot this season, matched right up.
B003SZZWDO|5|Perfect fit
B004GXWJQU|5|it very good for any thing i need to did itfor all kind like WD-40, but it better.
B000WP55LC|5|The fit was good the chrome Finnish was flawless
B002Y35O8O|5|These are THE SAME AS &#34;:TOYOTA&#34; branded coils (Toyota Part number (90919-A2007), but cost half as much. Denso is the OEM supplier to Toyota and other OEMs.
B003SY56PO|5|This part fit my Plymouth Voyager great.  The installation was quick and fairly simple.
B001PWFPE8|5|Works with 07 Avalanche, Specs said it would not, Very happy with product, Nice to have tailgate not just drop down.
B007YVPDWI|2|Too short to be useful. Made for midgets.
B000JIDTRE|5|It fit my 2006 Honda Ridgeline RTS perfectly! Easy installation!
B0070NNUQG|5|Item shipped fast, great quality and made int the USA!
B000OR18BE|5|Definitely worth getting.<br />Living in my trailer and wouldn't part with it. One thing is when you are emptying your tanks into it, remove the valve floater at the end as the tote is filling up to let the gases escape from your RV into the tote then out of the tote. Otherwise you trap part of the gases inside the RV and you end up smelling it for a while.<br />Overall, extremely satisfied with the product.
B003G32T8O|4|perfect fit good quality very reasonable price
B000C39C72|5|Excellent product and recommend it Aadhan Excellent seller recommend it
B009DJMX0Y|5|LOVING IT!
B0001EWCN8|5|great product fast shipping

B00BMRZN66|5|This is a great product.  I highly recommend it.
B007013WUW|5|RUSH Rocks and so does this sticker!  I was excited to get it and couldn't wait to put it on my car!  Now everyone knows what I am listening to when I'm driving down the street!
B000CPIJWO|1|Very disappointed, the gauge is not as pictured.  Wanted the gage pictured plain with black face.  It came with the manufacturer's name (Russell) on the front in red and yellow and with a blue face!!
B00BDO48XM|5|I love it
B0022ZJX1I|3|Just what I expected, grips are grips.
B004MSJ7C8|5|1981 Honda GL1100, synchronized carb in 30 minutes. I ordered the unit with 2 guages, as soon as I was done I ordered a second set just so next time I don't have to swap guages around.
B00TAFK6PA|5|What I expected
B00EFPDU3K|5|I absolutely love them
B00I0ZXV5S|1|it would not fit my 2005 chry. van.  may fit some autos
B010MR6UKO|5|Very nice kit
B0028WT63K|5|lovely
B00IKKS4W8|5|one of the oem jacks failed so selected these based on other reviews. ordered two even though we only required one also based on reviews. this review really just confirms all the other positive reviews. these are a vast improvement, much smoother and sturdier. certainly will be replacing the other set just to prevent future issues on the road
B00DLZZ772|1|The product is ok. The only issue I had is the gromet for the air sensor did not go in well and did not hold the air sensor good enough making the intake not work correctly. They should make the tube have a insert for the intake that will hold it in place better like the K&N Blackhawk cai
B00PP79NAQ|5|Needed new hardware for a jeep I bought and came across these. Would buy them again and again and again. They are great and worth not having to use a tool set every time.
B00ZZO0448|5|Can't beat the price of these LEDs.Plus the CO. has great customer service. But make sure what brightness you require
B0007VM3DE|1|Worst transaction ever!  Now I am asked to pay return shipping after receiving a bumper that doesn't fit my truck?  Look...I am telling you this bumper will not work on my truck. I never intended to hire a welder or mechanic to install it. Everything I read before I bought it led me to believe I could take the old bumper off and install the new one. I am mechanical inclined and I am telling you the bumper will not work. Setting it on the brackets left a 3 inch gap between the gate and the bumper. The brackets were not even close to fitting the bumper. Even if I had a welder change the brackets it will not look right. I am asking for my money back. I can buy another bumper that will just bolt up to the existing brackets cheaper than I can hire a welder to try to fit something that looks bad on the truck. Not as advertised. You let me know something asap! Thanks  see less
B000H8U37K|5|This product did exactly what it was supposed to. It's not OEM but it's half the price and looking at it you cant tell the difference.
B007XWDJ7Y|4|Did not plug and play into my 06 F150. However with little wiring the light looks amazing. Goes well with all of my LEDs. Feels sturdy and not cheap.
B005DUUT0I|5|Great product
B0009MK4VY|5|Easy to clean it.They are not slidig
B00NF1PXW6|5|great.
B00UT13P2K|5|I didn't rasef 2  18 LED White Dash Warning
B000N9LM6E|5|Fit perfect and works
B000ALG86E|5|a good price
B00IARU7WG|5|They fit like a glove.
B00ASMYU3I|5|great battery fit perfect
B00CAKILAO|5|Bought this for the trunk of our 2015 Mazda 6. After cutting out along the edges, it contoured quite well to the trunk covering almost all of it. Pretty good quality and doesn't move around.
B00QHJ2EHK|5|This is an amazing little box.  Carry it in the trunk and never have a problem with a battery.
B009OTK094|5|I use an oz plus water in the foam lance and this takes all the grime right off... Don't need to touch the car with hand except for a few hard areas... Just make sure your mixture is hick enough coming out of the foam lance... Much recommended
B00YLZ7C3S|2|it does not fit in my car and would not hold my pocketbook
B0009IQZFM|2|The cloth is very absorbent, but after it gets wet, its as good as any thick cotton cloth. Unless you squeeze out the water frequently, it'll leave behind water drops. Better to spend your money buying a couple of good absorbent cotton cloths.
B000C57L64|5|Good shocks
B00BMDZ0UO|2|poorly plated.
B00LEBLI82|1|Had to return them.  bought them for my camper to replace the old incandescent bulbs to save battery power while camping.  None of them worked even when I rotated 180 degrees for the polarity and I tried them in all the sockets just to make sure it wasn't my socket.
B000VU8KG0|5|the last things I needed to finish my project... grant gt's web sight is a little misleading!
B0059XCVVO|1|Bubbles are hard to avoid. Doesn't stretch like 3M vinyl wrap. Scratches VERY easily.
B0090WRP6G|5|Very nice unit.  Looks great in my RV.  Extremely easy to install and a good bargain.  I'm very pleased with it.
B00VMZ3GIU|1|They won't stay tight on front end. The gasket will not stay stuck to the flare on the edge and it rubs against the paint on the fender. Really disappointed with the design. It is not worth the money. I had them painted to color match the truck and everything and now I am going to have to get my fender repainted. Don't buy these they are bad!!!!
B000CQFVN8|4|Nice kit.  I didn't use the switch as I connected the solenoid to my SPOD.  The install was easy and the directions were clear.  Please view my video install: http://www.jk-forum.com/forums/jk-write-ups-39/how-warn-62132-power-interrupt-kit-connected-via-spod-324982/
B000182F18|3|Have a nice day
B00267PZUK|4|worked as stated.made clusterfk bearable, was able to take 3 broken plugs out of 08 expedition and was on road quickly
B00JA80PEO|5|This device works great to pair my full-face modular helmet with my Blackberry Classic.  There is no wind noise and I have had several people tell me they could not tell I was on a motorcycle.  The battery holds a good charge, but wish it used a micro USB plug.  I have not used the intercom feature, but would not hesitate to buy another if I needed to communicate with another rider.
B000CMCNJC|4|Great item, no complaints...
B00J6GXXWG|1|I got a defective pair.  You see one of the cross bars was twisted just enough that I didn't notice it until I went to install them on the 2012 Jeep Patriot. This was AFTER I had recycled the packaging.<br />Prepared to ship them back anyway, but seriously not happy, I decided to try to straighten out the worst one in my workshop. I was successful enough to make the bar flatter so that it clamps up almost tight on both sides of the Jeep top.<br />I am now hoping for some incentive to remove my review of dissatisfaction.
B002969BQW|5|works good
B00XZ2NF34|5|SIMPLY NICE !!!
B007Q9VHNM|5|as expected
B005TIH1PA|5|nice
B009OBVRY4|4|Works good but pricey considering you have to supply the motor.
B000IEZENG|5|as expected
B0001MII88|5|Perfect
B00IFHNEYO|5|Battery posts are like traditional powersports batteries, but it was easy to adjust the battery cables to fit.  Took a 2300 mile trip and battery performed great in temps in the mid 40s and over 100.  So far, I am happy.  Shipping was free, and cost about $40 less than the OEM.
B00EDWF1BE|3|Great product but difficult to install.
B00OPMIR2M|5|I know a bit about cars, changed oil, jumped a battery and such. I don't relish any of this.<br />I was offered this gauge and asked to review it. Well, now I can check my tire pressure in my driveway when the situation warrants, first Saturday of the month, looks under inflated or going out of town.<br />Where I live, all the gas stations have pay service air unless you go in ask the clerk to turn the air on, as required by state law. It's not unusual to have to go in again to remind them, so for me to go to just check tire pressure is a pain, not to mention dragging a giant hose around.<br />I found the interface pretty simple to use with this gauge, as well as the gauge itself, and it seemed accurate enough to be in relative agreement with the popup gauge on the air pressure hose. Nothing was too wildly out of sync to lead me to conclude either gauge was out of whack.<br />Five Stars for convenience and removal of reasons why there just isn't time to check air pressure.
B0098Y8TV6|5|Far exceeded what I thought
B005LTIU9S|5|Slick tool to use when pulling high flow vacuum..
B002GU8KLI|1|Use any good marine grade power steering fluid and use the same for your power steering. 1 fluid 2 uses and much cheaper than this overpriced stuff.
B00KVC78RU|5|I installed them into a 1980 Chevy van. The lights showed up bright blue until the bulb was inserted into dash. The lights then look a deep purple (except from a side view the blue could be seen). I also purchased a led blue light for the gear indicator. That displayed blue when installed. So dash has both blue and purple appearance.
B00BCR7BCU|3|Not bad
B00P9W8NLW|5|I used this to suck a think sludgy gear oil (like mud) from the transfer case of my CX-9. The power clamps are pretty short. Definitely not far enough to be using under a car but fine for engine bay use. I used jumper cables as an extension to a battery on another vehicle alongside the car I was under. I also ran the other car while the pump was running to maximize the power. It worked without any performance issues so I'm satisfied. Beats a manual pump for sure.
B00CEXKAK6|5|Looks very good fit was good would recommend.
B0015PPWUM|4|Good looking tail lights. They fit pretty well, there's a bit more of a gap compared to stock and they don't follow the body lines as well. BUT you can't expect perfection.
B00XRKV4UK|4|Its great as usual i wish it lasted longer
B003QJF12O|5|Great alarm, easy to install.
B004GFFIVG|5|Hi, as usual it came and worked just fine, thank you. Cam
B00NH49NL8|5|great item used it more times then I thought.  I did recently see a 1 pack at menards for $2 thou
B002YKETS8|5|No chance of spilling with this attachment.
B00XV4W686|5|Bought these in hope of having brighter front indicator lights on my 2011, 2014 and 2015 Honda CBR1000RR motorcycles.  These fit the socket correctly and are significantly brighter than the stock incandescent bulbs, plus they have a crisp on/off that helps make the blinking more noticeable.  WAY better than any other LED replacement bulb I've ever purchased. I've already bought more for my other bikes. There's no down side to these - these lights are excellent!
B005G21BVO|5|Good price, arived before expected. Good quality
B00BK7MFC8|5|Works great for checking ring and pinion patterns !
B00UZ0OHIQ|4|I've had this product for a few weeks now and overall I like it - it gives me interesting information about gas consumption, etc.  I should add this wasn't something I normally would have purchased, rather it was given to me for free by my auto insurance company to calculate a potential discount.<br /><br />My only issue with it is its assessment of what is/is not 'hard braking.'  I've had a few of those come up in the last few weeks - one I'll agree with.  I was driving on the highway and it was, at one point, the only way to avoid an accident so 'sorrynotsorry' as the kids say... But the other two - I thought, what?!?  I was driving the speed limit (honestly!) and came to a yellow light and slowed to stop in time.  It 'dinged' me for hard braking?  My only other alternative would have been to run the red light... which is not what I think we want. ;)  It makes me wonder if the technology is somewhat tied in to individual cars and how your own personal brakes are calibrated or something?<br /><br />Bad timing, my daughter is going to get her driving permit during the time we have this active - I guess our discount won't be as much as hoped, ha!  The good side, though, is that I will have the ability to know right away if she gets in an accident once she gets her full license.
B00R26RCVK|4|I purchased this for my work truck. It gets hot here in Mississippi and I work outdoors. A few years ago, I purchased a similar product which works fine but this seemed like it would do just as well for less money. It's easy to clean and my seats still look brand new and don't smell. The only issue I have had is I sat down and scooted forward and where the cover attaches to the headrest pulled loose. It's just glued on where the velcro meets up so I was able to reattach it. Other than that, it's a great product.
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Great product! The only sunshade big enough for my 2014 tundra and sequoia.
B00JUI7VW8|5|is good  the numers is red color
B0084USM2Q|1|We received the rack in perfect timing, however when we went to install the front bar is 1/2 inch too short and the screws are not long enough to install.  This is very frustrating as when you buy something that says it is for your make and model vehicle you expect it to fit and the hardware to be consistent.  Extremely disappointed.
B000HSB298|5|This is the third set of these that I have used over several years and they are a great up grade over the OEM springs. These along with Harley SE Heavy(or 15wt) fork oil makes the front end dive less and removes most of the wobble that occurs on fast bumpy sweepers.
B000ZMWYFM|3|The price was right.  I had to change the wiring a bit and the sending unit works but the scale is off.  When it shows 1/4 tank the tank is empty.  Ford wanted almost $800 for the replacement pump - That's just not right!  I am very thankful that Airtex makes their pump affordable.
B00CLPVBYQ|5|I love these lights, they are very bright and light up my whole interior of my car.
B000I2079E|4|Seems to work, still spraying a a rusted receiver hitch trying to remove it.  Might have to get the torch regardless of any spray.
B00L7EZOCC|3|It looks great but not perfect and with a proper gasket sticks up at the edge, with the flat gaskets my garage sinks of gas, whereas with the regular thick gasket it only smells sometimes. Still 1000x better than stock cap.
B000COBK8A|5|These horns work better than the horns that came with my car.
B0044AZ44O|5|good choice
B008JYXYNY|5|Love these, ordered some as presents!
B001KSE10G|5|Fit my 2005 CRV drivers side mirror perfectly, quick and easy to apply. Much less than the dealership charges for replacement mirrors.
B003COQAFU|5|Best 3500 lb winch in my opinion.  Install was simple and didn't take hours and hours.
B00QHZV7IQ|5|Purpose for buying was to be used in backing up a 26 foot travel trailer. With that in mind here is my review. The wifi is strong enough and provides an excellent image to my I pad while in vehicle. The camera could use a wider angle lens, but this is minor. The image is not a mirror image, meaning the what is on the driver side appears on the passenger side. The software does offer mirror image adjustment but it does not work. Talking to tech rep from the camera manufacturer I was informed they were working on software update to correct this problem. He indicated it was long overdue.Required some getting use to. Quality of product is good, but is not weather tight. Magnets hold well to the metal bumper of the travel trailer but are not super strong and SHOULD not be used while going down the road.Instructions included with camera indicate that.<br />This does not need any wiring. No tinkering running wire to your back taillights and that is a great asset. Before I back into a site, I simply take the camera out of its pouch, turn it on, attach it using the magnets on the rear bumper, turn on my IPAD making sure I go to settings and pick up the wifi in settings, turn on the ramcam app, and voila, it works great.<br />Downloading the app is a breeze and free.<br />It will hold a charge for about 3 to 4 hours, lithium ion battery. Has the cord and 12 volt plug for charging, stand for IPAD or IPHONE,<br />Hope this helps<br />Am very pleased, and when the mirror image gets corrected it will be even better. I would surely recommend this to a friend.<br />Quality, of materials are very good, wifi is very good, range of wifi is very good, image quality is color and very good, serves the application I am using it for as expected.
B00KWGU71Y|5|Work and fit as expetted.
B001S8F7Q0|5|Arrived right on time. No problems..Thank You!!
B006H34BUY|5|It's easy to use and to clean after it has finished being used.
B00KTIWD44|5|Perfect product and fast delivery
B002IS1MC2|5|Love it!!  Bought matching sticker for my car.  But the keychain did break off.  I'm hard on them though.
B00GEIIPZ4|3|The harness work fine, the relay is trash made in China. It is the problem everyone (my sons) had - the relay doesn't work from scratch. Bought new relay ($6.99) and the harness work like it is designed. STOP buying chip trash!!!
B0054R7KV6|5|Good fit
B00KY45LAG|5|I got this for my 2015 Buick Enclave. It fits *almost* perfect; there is a bit here and there it doesn't quite cover. It is very sturdy construction, and I like having the gold option, which goes well with my colors. As far as windshield blockers go, this is the gold standard, as far as I'm concerned. (Pun intended.) I had one like this for my old ML320 that I got from the dealership; I am pretty sure it's the same manufacturer, and that one lasted for many years as I expect this one to.<br /><br />But, for the Enclave in particular, the visors are not flexible or long enough to push it up flush with the windshield. This is a issue with the Enclave, not the screen, but it does reduce its effectiveness I suspect, leaving a couple inches of space for air to get really toasty between the shade and the windshield.<br /><br />Another consideration is that the Enclave windshield is so huge, this has to be huge, and there isn't a great place to stow it. The best I've found is right behind the front passenger seat, but it is a bit of a nuisance there for folks in the back.<br /><br />Still, I think of all available options, this is the best, and it will definitely help to protect your dash and minimize internal heat on hot days.
B00O83NSY0|5|Looks great and easy install...and a great price.
B010C8FAWW|5|Awesome sticker!!
B003E2AC0E|1|Junk Junk Junk  this is Junk!! I dont care how you prepare your part to be painted. Does not work!!!!!! Even watched u tube. Don't wast your money!!!!
B00JH23OM8|4|Had it for a couple months now no problems yet (04 636 ninja)
B00460P5XC|5|awesome
B001AIZ5HY|5|GREAT PRODUCT
B00U8695HK|5|As simple as popping out of the box and into the cigarette lighter port of the car. No maintenance and anyone that uses an ionizer at home knows they really work. Amazing customer service and communication.
B00AAXKQME|5|I was happy with the product and the timely manner it was sent . I thought the price was very reasonable.
B00OOOV566|1|When installed, one strut was OK, the other chattered and made a horrible noise when opening or closing. Had other struts installed locally, and threw the partsam junk in the trash-can where it belonged.
B00213265Q|5|I love it, good look good quality
B0002SRF4O|5|Works very well
B009S9RURU|5|Good.
B00FLB7SGC|1|Doesn't fit properly. Primer issues. Paint pealed.
B00HB9K55S|5|Works great
B0009H51ZI|4|Fit perfectly on my Ford escape. Good price too. I recommend. The packaging was pretty beat up on arrival
B00M9NGOEM|3|OK job...nothing special
B00GKLAJFO|5|Highly recommended. Can feel the engine really come to life. Boosted acceleration and slightly better gas mileage. Works even better with a throttle body spacer.
B00EJFH6YA|2|Brackets shown I  picture are not what I received.  Will be returning them.
B0047DGTIS|5|They were awesome I would replace every car that has those airbags with this setup it was so easy  and they ride very nice thank you so much have a blessed day.Sweet
B00062ZVZ6|5|Fits perfectly and hasn't aged or faded at all
B00DSD5BO6|1|I placed it on my trucks window and it was full of holes the next day.
B000B8N3C8|4|Seals well and easy to turn.
B000EDUTPE|3|Hose barb is larger than the one that was on my Scamp trailer.  I had to get a new section of hose, which led to logistics problems with the bend it had to make.
B00DNGEI9M|3|Glue strip  that came with did not stick more than two weeks on some areas, had to use own glue, other than that look great, covers sun damage on molding that most Avalanche get.
B004RCUTGC|3|I used teflon tape to seal between sections.  Hope it works long term.
B009NHW8HE|1|Come on people, its a $3 PVC ball valve sold in plumbing department for water use. Someone just figured they could make up some spouts for $5 and sell them to people for $20 that don't know gas melts PVC. I'm sure they will work fine for diesel for a few months but yes GAS NO!!!!!
B0049IZSS8|5|This was easy to put on and works great.  Have used it several time and took all the play out of the hitch.  Would recommend.  Great price compared to some of the others and does what it is suppose to do.
B008CRF0ZI|4|No issues, but in conjunction with new Akebono pads the initial bite is much softer than previous combination of OEM rotors and pads.
B00AEDACIS|2|All parts there, but one of the tensioners let go the next day, the ratchet pawl stripped & I had to get an OE tensioner and re do the job. American flags on the box but a small piece of paper inside that says &#34; contents made in CHINA&#34;
B00RM327NG|5|Top notch product.
B0000AXY5Y|5|OE replacement .
B00COOQUW2|4|Fit great.
B003RYOWH8|4|There OK for the price.
B006OSNUZO|5|Very happy with this helmet. We have a Slingshot, so we're not in the full wind blast, but for our purposes it's great for the price.
B004MDEV38|5|Incredibly easy to install. eTrailer dot com has a video on YouTube showing the process. Just 5 bolts total in existing threaded holes. All you need is a basic socket set.
B000CSQEV4|5|GOOD PART
B0053ZX05E|5|Fits the car perfectly.
B003L33Q0O|3|I'm sure this is excellent chain lube, BUT the problem is that it's a pain in the tush to apply without the stuff squirting all over the place!  The foam lube shoots out like a fire engine water hose, and it's hard to control!  Now my chain is properly lubed, but so is my garage floor and my rear tire!  If there is some way for the manufacturer to make the foam come out SLOWLY, that would be fantastic.
B008MM5ZFI|5|Great !!!!=
B002XL2IEA|4|works good
B009YP8PH2|5|Charges my ray electric motor on Pontoon 48 V 25 A, much cheaper than what the dealer wanted and it works just fine. The connection head is SB 50 in case you wonder
B00VE1R6MO|5|seems to work ok
B000COMX3Q|5|We bought it to lock the spare tire on our 2015 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited.  It fit perfectly and went on without issue.
B001JT72U2|5|Fun schrader valve caps add bling to my vintage bike. Ans it comes with an extra set, if you've got a bike ;)
B001AZH6H4|1|Received early.  I was excited about the double hook.  I had purchased one before but the hook was too thin. It held up better than this product. The pieces keep coming apart and falling to the floor.  I considered crazy glue, however, I became frustrated. I originally bout two -one for each side but had the same result. Will not purchase again.
B00QMWQOHS|5|good quality for the price.also great service.
B0083H5ES0|5|This thing works great and save you tons of money will buy again if I needed.
B002PQW4SI|5|One of my front lights had a crack that allowed moisture in to corrode the light socket, this was the perfect replacement.
B00YIA2VH8|5|Love going out to my car and seeing this. Makes my day. Fun and awesome
B0046KLUGS|5|I bought this for a 2009 Honda Odyssey. I chose these rails because they were locking rails and the price was hard to beat when compared to OEM parts. To operate the rails you unlock the end cap on each side and a small square rod will pull out with the cap as you remove it. This square rod is used to tighten the clamps to your existing side rails. I used some locking pliers to really get the clamps tight.  The clamps themselves have rubber on them so they grip really well, and after I tightened them up they simply wouldn't budge. I used them with a roof bag and my cargo was secured well for the 7 hr trip I took. The rails themselves are very strong and sturdy. No hint of a bend or wobble in them. The rails are square with grooves along the length of them on the top for added grip. Without the bag on top the bars will generate noise above about 40-45 mph. Overall I was pleased with the product and would buy again.
B00Z7KIZPA|3|Very hard to use
B00PR55954|5|Amazing
B004992OC0|5|Second time ordering the pair, that's how good of a deal it is. As mentioned before, no directional flow arrow but both sides are exactly the same, doesn't matter. The only issue I have is that they lasted only two years until my AC started barely blowing on the drivers side. But for the price, I can't complain. Will buy again when needed. 2006 Titan.
B001XUD46S|2|Fits great but did not have tape installed on the driver side front door vertical piece. Causes the window to catch everytime it's rolled up and cracked on the first day. Will contact the manufacturer for replacement.
B0010JP988|5|Bought these awesome pewter charms as a memorial for our family dogs that have died over the years. Highly recommended
B00DQJB7EK|4|doesn't get as good of reception as the factory, but its short and out of the way
B00UNPAR50|2|wrong fitting to low pressure fitting at condenser.  Gauge worked fine after replacing blue hose.
B002EP0SG0|5|Great belt for my 04 Polaris Sportsman and am happy I bought it but I did have to exchange the first one as it had an uneven cut on one side causing the machine to keep moving forward when trying to stop. It was wide in one area by a 1/16 of an inch. Just enough to cause problems but all is well on the 2nd. I would expect that from any belt manufacturer though.<br /> So yes I would recommend this belt, it high quality, soft and reliable.
B00EKTJEW2|5|easy to install, looks great
B000C32IUK|5|My ac belt was badly worn because the guy before me didn't change it. Replaced it with one of these bad boys and I love it.
B00MB0EXGE|5|I LOVE IT!!!!!!
B00GHT6SF4|4|Just as described
B00W92OIOQ|1|I ordered 8 and only received 6
B0062IJQEA|5|Very good
B0009V1WSE|5|Nice lock worth the money
B003VAUL0A|5|These turnbuckles worked perfect to hold my Scamper slide-in on my truck.
B00FGOUKZK|5|It did the job,
B00M229MIA|5|Installed for my Polaris 250cc Trailboss and works just fine.
B00SLXLKLG|5|Nice product.
B0024E6V30|5|Leaves the water into the RV crystal clear and tasteless.
B00H7R2R28|5|Very nice build quality. Totally revitalized my old FOB.
B00L6XCK44|5|My dealership was trying very hard to convince me that most of the key fobs bought online doesn't work.  I'm glad I took a gamble....it in fact works beautifully just like the original.  After paying for the key cutting and the programming, I saved over half of the price the dealer would have charged.  I have 2010 Toyota matrix.
B000AP8DZY|5|Waxed my car and it really protects my car. It is easy to put on and easy to wipe off.
B00F4MQJ5O|5|great light bar, have 4 on jeeps all working great
B004HK2DK4|5|Despite reading lots of good reviews I really thought this purchase would end badly.  It did not.  In fact, I am pleasantly surprised with the quality and fit of these hubcaps.  Yes, they look like an aftermarket cap.  No, they do not look bad -- they look sharp.  They are much thinner than OEM caps (for a 2004 Toyota Matrix) but, hey, they cost less than $10 each vs. $55 each for new OEM caps.  No doubt they will not last if handled roughly during tire rotations, so handle them gently.  Overall very pleased and would buy again.
B005DM0OC4|5|Works great! Wish I would have bought it as soon as I bought my truck!
B007IVU2DE|5|Perfect! Not too flashy - just right! Looks great on our '15 Silver Duramax!
B008B0TBLK|5|good product
B00F9RNIPI|5|It's a high quality product and they include a case and gloves, too.
B003ZWHVZW|5|Product arrived on time and works as expected.
B000N5ST3C|4|Good packaging, been holding up, I have purchased this brand for all my smaller batteries, seem to hold up, just be smart about it and make sure you don't have a drain on the system and take care of the machine and the batteries hold up.
B00QEXZVHE|5|A very nice BRIGHT replacement for my burned out stock bulbs.
B00396DMZ2|5|they are very strong and reliable; make sure the size is right.
B005QV5V7A|5|bushings for rear shocks too xmall
B00CCIM1YQ|5|Have to say this seems to be one tough piece of hardware at an unbeatable price.  Bought this as a bicycle lock and it seems pretty formidible.
B00EVPLSAQ|5|Very nice grease gun.
B007Z09GE4|5|works great!
B002R1FYYW|1|Passenger Side: Uneven, very spotty (many &#34;dead spots&#34; in the beam) and inadequate (range of) coverage - both high and low beams. I'm no lighting engineer...but, why they (those who designed this after market headlight assembly) employ rectangular shapes rather than a contiguous, smooth, convex shape for the reflective surface surrounding the bulb is beyond me.  Unfortunately, OEM headlight replacements for the '98 Ford Windstar are roughly $250 each - so, onward w/ the search for suitable after market headlights...
B004MGAYRC|3|There is a huge problem here.<br /><br />I ordered this product for my Cadillac Escalade after doing tons of research about the quality.<br /><br />The problem is that these are I'll described. They are NOT, I repeat not CAPA certified..<br /><br />I ordered a set and they came without the proper certification, so I contacted CAPA, who confirmed they are not certified by them. What a bummer.<br />So I had them replaced and was assured that I would receive the proper product. Nope! It was like a dog chasing it's tail in a circle. I continued the return process for 3 additional shipments until I finally had enough and realized I wasn't going to get what I payed for. Instead, I fought the description and the price was adjusted accordingly, not by much but it was something.<br /><br />The product does fit well and works well also. I guess they are just as good as CAPA certified, MAYBE, but I hate to purchase cheap products for an expensive car!
B008SGN0SC|1|I received my product damaged. Very disappointed
B000FOIJXQ|4|Worked well. My vinyl was grey and now is nice and black. Took 3-4 coats.  Just not fond of the applicator or would have gave 5 stars.
B000TYOS3C|5|Exact fit for my truck as promised. Factory replica.
B00C1CEIQW|5|As described almost like oem....
B00TJ268D8|2|It have cracks in upper part, where the stop lamps go. The inferior tabs are weak.
9539751713|5|Good sticker
B0059XEM9I|1|Odd shipping. Pealed off in car heat.
B00IJ1RQ22|5|Great parts even bttr price
B000A0EJYS|5|This is a great replacement filter and is washable. I'll put this filter up ageist the more expensive ones for the money.
B009HYFJ10|5|Very nice, very quiet, quality construction and comparable to my Shoie. Much lighter as well, but then my other helmet is ten yrs old.
B0031BQ29S|5|Worked perfectly on my street glide...
B010H0QV00|1|Horrible quality. Do not waist your money on this.
B0028MN4MY|4|they fit, but make sure if you are changing all four, to buy three of these and one long one.  if you can't find the long one, just order a fourth one of these and you can alter it with the old one by splicing the wires to fit perfectly...2007 hyundai sonata 3.3l
B00NIXAOUM|5|perfect fit good price
B000CAVDEU|5|Exactly what I needed
B002G1PBHI|2|About 8 degrees off.
B000E4JLM0|5|Fits great, looks good....
B00W5MG8XY|5|Very high quality product!!
B009VC0HO2|5|Fits perfect and looks great.
B00LIXZLR0|5|These pods are good quality and easy to install I use them for fog lights and they make a huge difference
B0081TGGKA|2|It was great
B000ZAP5JG|2|What is up with the head rest covers???  They are 2 times too big and they look ridiculous!!!  As for the instructions....Might as not have any.  Not worth the price.  The fit isn't the greatest either.  Too bad.
B00OY94H0M|5|arrived as expected better price than found locally
B0096UAY6A|5|Very good light does not feel cheap. mounted perfectly in the back deck of my 06 Charger. Fit right in between the rear deck speakers. Perfect for POV Vol firefighters/ EMS. On top of all of that you can still see it really well through my window tint. Will be buying another one for the other vehicle!
B00SG7U68K|5|You may think you don't  need  these  but trust me, new ones will make a difference .Very easy to  install.
B000LNBLTK|5|Great product
B0087NB1IW|5|Easy to install on my basic helmet with the provided 3M tape. It charges with a standard micro USB, like most phones. Seems to pick up my voice well even at highway speeds, but the volume on the speakers isn't high enough. They can hear me, but I have trouble hearing them. However, Bluetooth in my helmet is great. I can listen to music and have GPS directions, which is pretty much essential for a long trip. Definitely beats having an earbud in.
B00PBDSVLQ|5|Great product easy to apply,  would order again
B00H7MUY0U|3|Delivery was fast! Had trouble with the back seat cover but the driver and passenger covers are nice
B00S0X199U|5|cool
B00801RIUQ|5|Great product compared to another brand I used on same vehicle.
B0012TYNY2|5|Nice
B00RQO763C|1|OMG if I could give it ZERO stars I would....
B001AVSIOI|5|fit just right
B000KKKDMK|5|Worked great
B00FJH2BSI|1|Does NOT match paint color. Its several shades lighter, almost a gray. So glad I tested it first. Beware.
B00BG423YA|4|My only problem is it doesn't come with a bolt, and it's hard to find the bolt that will fit in my bmw
B00CPSWKLC|5|Sooooooooo love mine!  Classy looking, too!   ♥♥♥
B001V8U3J8|5|Great fixed my Awning on my travel trailer, will probably be getting a new canvas soon, Thanks James
B00818AO6I|5|well worth the money...:)
B000EVWDAK|5|Works great, use it all the time on all my vehicles with ODBII, Thanks James
B000GPV2QA|5|I've owned this for 4 years and it still works well. Will jump almost any car even with a completely dead battery.
B001FN21RQ|5|Excellent product, great transaction have recommended to others.
B000L50ZVI|5|Its not the wax we are use too, once applied, easily i might add, i can throw a bucket of water over truck and it is still near completely dry. Cant wait to drive in rain and truck stay dry, that means it will stay clean longer and with the new smooth feel it wipes dry with Chamois real easy now the few water spots that will be visible after wash. An amazing wax for sure, i doubt i will ever buy anything else. The Chamois dry process use to take about 30 minutes, now 5 or so.  Im sure truck cleanings will be needed far less now. That time saved is well worth the added cost.
B00DJBQ1SW|5|Excellent product. Easy to use.
B00EIIP9EM|5|Awesome set
B000B5ZM6Q|5|Nice covers, fit well. Good quality.
B007RW3KJM|5|Works perfectly
B00OJYH8JY|2|Flicker and dim out quite often.  Not a reliable product at all.
B00EZUL6ZY|5|The material was so week they tore
B00KRAO6C6|1|Cheaply made! Waste of money!
B00T811EC0|5|Beautiful, well crafted tag!  Thank you!
B0015X95M0|4|good product, when we opened the box at least 4oz had spilled out. some one did not check the cap before shipping.
B0077POV6A|5|I put this on my 1999 and now on my 2007, and think it's a great investment.
B00153VMJY|5|Fit like champ and still working great.
B001LHVOVK|5|Works Great
B0009OA4JO|4|Very comfortable with added back support vs. low-boy seat that came on my Craftsman lawn tractor. Negative is that it was NOT a direct replacement. I did have to play a bit with fittings due to holes not quite matching up. Not a huge deal. Wobbles a little (left/right), but no big deal.
B004LX14Z2|5|Works exactly as described.  The best feature is the memory; when turned on it comes up with the settings I originally programed.  So I never need to attend to it (The eyelet connectors are bolted to the batteries, and a timer turns it on and off at prescribed times daily.).  One minor problem I had when I went to connect it, I couldn't find the eyelet connectors.  After calling NOCO tech support I found out I needed to unbolt them from the clamps using an Allen wrench (the bolts initially looked to me to be rivets).
B000NPVRZE|5|Great cover, easy to put on the bike just watch the antenna when you are installing the cover... Because snap... the extra long Spyder antenna will break easily when installing  the cover. The cover fully covers the bike and keeps the dust off the bike while parked. The cover also keeps the bike from baking in the sun if you are parked outside on a hot day. Great product at the fraction of the cost of the factory cover.
B008QY6380|5|Top fit great<br />Installation was straight forward<br />Did need an extra set of hands at the end
B00H0E6TTU|5|Very very bright!! Love the spot and flood combination works well on and off-road NO noise like you get from some other light bars!!
B000HAEPSG|5|Directions for how to effectively lock the cover once on the car would be helpful. I just threaded it through the door handle(?)
B008MM5ZFI|5|Great product and easy to apply.
B0110CO95S|1|came in 3 days, good stickers but i didnt get any nike sb sticker but overall im happy
B000VAQ4FY|5|Love these shocks. Been on freeway and off road and the adjustment ability has been phenomenal!  Will buy these for my other car in a heartbeat!
B00N9XVP9U|5|GREAT DEVICE. STAYS IN YOUR GLOVE BOX READY FOR ACTION!
B01092I9LA|1|These covers are cheap, and look horrible! If you're looking for a way to immediately make your car look cheap and unflattering, look no further! The front seats pucker and sag everywhere. The headrest is too large and doesn't seamlessly connect to seat (fabric hangs out). The backseat requires cutting to accommodate seat belts and headrest. The fabric is itchy and thin. I regret not buying more expensive, more durable covers because my new car that I was trying to protect looks like a hoopty now!
B001DKN9CC|5|Work great
B00CTLGSZO|1|Worked great for about 9 months.<br />9 months in the unit stopped working<br />Took it apart and found it had been leaking water into itself. Take a look at what happens after 9 months
B009VQJDLG|5|Very bright! lights up the road with no issues. and they blue ring around the light is bright is self good and well constructed product very happy with my purchase
B000VU56Z8|5|Great Heavy Mat
B00QHGWP22|3|Eh it's ok
B00839JOFM|5|put them all in my car. dash and aound the radio. did have to glue some but they are really cute
B000FCRS0I|5|Took me long enough, but I finally bought a car escape tool. I (thankfully) haven't had to use this tool yet, but I did test it out. Based on a few negative comments when I bought this, I tried it out immediately upon opening: I pressed the window breaker end down on some cardboard I had nearby and it left a noticeable indention after &#34;firing!&#34; Two or three more clicks later with the same results, and I'm satisfied mine is functional. It IS a tad bulky on a keyring, mind you; but that also makes it easy to locate. It doesn't weigh much either. I'd buy more to give as gifts, after I tested them.
B00FZ5R4AE|5|Very nice Hat! i have several hats i wear for work and they get all sweaty and faded. i wanted a nice casual hat. This fits the bill. love it and my fiancè also loves it.
B00FALW192|2|As a profession car builder , I would not recommend this product , it does not work as well as 3M step 1-4 system , I like the smell =but as far as shiny , it will give you that but it will take twice as much time and product and you are still schussing halos<br />Eric-<br />www.airkooledkustoms.com
B000WO7516|4|fast delivery, numbers look great on plate and a friendly price.
B005BFM0AC|5|Excellent Quality Product
B01350HPMW|4|Got my helmet great shipping couple cosmetic issue's but I could care less about that
B00NPQV06O|5|Exactly as described, & very rugged.
B000CD57DA|3|Did what it was suppose to do, but was plastic not brass like the picture.
B00F09D9YA|5|Multiple sizes. I used it on my steering wheel gear shift. Took less than two minutes to install.
B000EPR086|1|Just purchased for my BMW 325i 2006, Amazon indicated it fits. Received it and it was not compatible, another set back.
B007NNUCDW|5|good fit for 2000 jeep grand cherokee
B001DXBZH0|5|DID THEJOB
B003TU662Y|3|The brush had zero give and did not work well on my shower because the bristles weren't pliable enough to get into the texture and such. It's a really sturdy brush, though.
B0047DB9PQ|4|Easy install only took about 30 min and under half the price of part store seems like nice product
B000JI6EDU|4|Ive only had this on my bike for a month but they're holding up. I put bungee on the top straps and the only problem I've had is that they contort the bag against the sissy bar and decrease the space in the bag because of the bending of the bag. On the other hand I can pack it full and run at 100 mph for a good thirty plus miles without it getting torn off. Doesn't come above the sissy bar so there's almost no win resistance. No difference in drag with them on or off. I like them.
B005XRFWNK|5|10 minute installation, loosen 2 nuts, remove old handle, reinstall new handle.
B009UGWT8G|5|Absolutely perfect!!!
B00CR1RGIO|2|I disappointed this product because it is not the I bought and expectation, I need the decal thinker than that and need sticker.<br />I am not expert installation, I don't know how the film will stick with the vehicle by themselves....
B006QZ54RM|5|Like the quality and size
B0002V2FEQ|5|The flamless heat gun was as advertised and arrived when promised. The product will work as a portable heat gun for heat shrink, espocially with the adapter. Good price and function.
B00QMTAZ1W|5|I read that this did not have mounting holes, it does under the plastic cover, works great just what my 73 beach buggy needed.
B000NW8E94|5|This part fixed the problem I was having.  I also put the old gas cap back on because the new one wasn't any good.
B0041U3LIS|5|Installed one and it is a perfect match for the OEM light on my 2010 Toyota Tacoma
B004O844DS|5|Works great!!
B00NAGZC3Q|5|If you don't have it you got to get it! This plug is great!! I recommend the Magnum magic spark  intensifier as well, an instant power increase guaranteed thanks!
B006OKXKA2|5|Product has held up past 2500miles. A slight hair of fuel increase (based on same measures used). No change of vehicle audible profile.
B0041DZYJO|4|Good price & fast shipping
B000GTZCWG|5|Says it doesn't fit the Yamaha fz6 but fits my Yamaha fz6 just fine. Good quality very durable
B00FQ0ROZS|4|The lights are good, the mounts are not very strong so the need to be mounted where brush wont hit them or they will bend.
B001T0BSJM|5|so far so good not thing wrong with it, thanks.
B00H1I639Q|5|Nice Nuts!
B00MEFH3JA|1|Not the sticker it looked like...deceptive put white on white like it really is...complete waste. Done w amazon
B0109JRL5S|3|Just  okay<br />It doesn't fit as well as I expected
B010VMSX14|5|Performance was what I expected
B00A7I4ZWE|4|Fit on my 2003 Toyota Corolla with ABS brakes without any problems.  Seems like a good replacement part.  Time will tell on the overall quality and durability.
B00DSD70AO|5|Just perfect really like them.
B00GXRM11A|5|Perfect fit, lost the old harness and now I'm pounding again
B000BQSIWK|4|This charger has some nice features and works reasonably well (and is priced right).  It obviously uses a switching supply as it will cause noise in any radio anywhere near it.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Although nothing can keep the car cool in this dry hot weather, at least the seat and steering wheel are okay to touch. This sun protector makes a huge improvement.
B00UX1SY6I|3|Very fast shipping from China... Product is alright - it's a far cry from &#34;heavy duty&#34; though, more like &#34;dainty&#34; as far as quality goes. The cup holder &#34;pads&#34; are a nice little pop of red, tossed the rest. Save your money for something more useful - that's my two-cents.
B00EVY74AK|5|Perfect installation using this product,  I would purchase from this seller again
B00HVVVEYM|4|We put this on our carrier for a trip, it fit well in the basket, tie downs were sturdy and secure.  It rained on our way home and this did leak a little, we had our camping gear in this and the sleeping bags on top on one side did get wet, but this is much better the the bag we were using.
B00D6IC1SW|5|Works good. Not as loud as I would of hoped for. But works well. Is built very well.
B000UVUAFO|2|Used on 2015 Toyota Tacoma Grey. Paint scratches by looking at it wrong.Thought this would work but only dulled scratches lightly. Still there.
B00P2QQEH0|5|Nice rack!
B002HVF7IU|5|very pleased feel safer with the wide magnifying mirrors pleased with price too
B00AAGOPGO|5|Use this in my Semi Tractor and it works great.  I love how it blocks out all the truck noise for the folks I call.  I was able to get the blue tooth setup in under a minute.  You can pay a lot less for a piece of junk.  This one is just a slam dunk for me.
B001KO5BRM|5|I am sure the wires are great to bad I don't have a harley and I can't read.amazon said hese would fit a 460 v8 ford... beware and read the item discriptions.
B00EUZZK74|1|Not as advertised. Does not lay flat and does not have a clean look at all.
B000C7ZC4U|5|Fit perfectly in my '81 Caprice.
B00CCSW0RE|5|Exactly what I needed to eliminate an exhaust rattle with my aftermarket exhaust.  I only ended up using two mounts but holy heck that exhaust doesn't move at all now!
B000BGJWA2|5|almost an exact match for my OEM Coleman by flagstaff Yuma pop up trailer. Two of the three holes lined up. I simply drilled a new hole. I did use caulking to make sure the screws stayed in place and around the base of this so that it sticks to the trailer side.<br /><br />Power cable end (the prongs) sits right inside of this, the door still closes.
B00BMRRXXW|5|Good deal.
B000CC0HZ4|5|High quality and a great price.
B000AME5HC|5|as expected
B00E8ZDIRK|1|Lasted only a few days
B0031B1YWI|5|Perfect fit! Took less than 10 minutes to replace.
B0037VIB6E|5|Surely , it's a very good product.  It does clean all leather perfectly.
B00DX8D00S|5|Fast shipping, great and sturdy product.
B00W5YJ820|5|Fit perfectly, and they protect the light wonderfully. They don't just fit the Lamphus lights but also some of the off brand ones of the same general design. Highly recommended, as it's much cheaper and easier to replace a cracked cover than a cracked light.
B00BFDGE4M|1|These are only rubber inserts, not wiper blades as described in the headline. Very misleading and inappropriate. Universally, and in any auto parts store, a &#34;blade&#34; is the entire assembly. If you buy only the rubber, its called an &#34;insert&#34;. You can buy better quality inserts for less than half this price at any auto parts store: even at Wal Mart
B000AM8BF4|5|great
B000CGVPB0|5|Over one year since I got these and they are just as good as the first day.  They look great and work well. I had issues with noise after the first installment.  Later I took it back to the mechanic and learned that I should also change my rotors.  I followed the suggestion of my mechanic and changed the rotors as well.  The squeaky noise went away, and never came back.<br />I am thinking about getting a new pair when the current ones wear out
B001ED6H5E|5|works great
B00266Z8LW|1|They are wired backwards and are junk. If you fiddle with it they will just fall apart.
B002IV8KR4|1|Stopped working after about 10 launches. Not sure how they're submersible when they have a big hole in the bottom....
B001EOWQRQ|5|A tad bit loose, (slight but not bad), for 2015 Chevy 2500HD.  Otherwise, does a perfect job of converting 2 1/2&#34; to 2&#34; receiver.  Holes line up exact!  Best price too!
B002S3Y0SU|1|Stopped working after about 10 launches. Not sure how they're submersible when they have a big hole in the bottom....
B00GIXEPFO|3|Easy install. Two sided tape not usable. Had to use a better grade of tape
B001CZYRB0|5|Use these on my 2008 Night Train (2nd set). No issues, no dust and stop well.
B00QMLTS8Q|1|Very cheap.  Not much weight to this at all. I should have just stopped at Auto Zone or Advanced, and for close to the same price ($11-$12), purchased a quality product. This is dollar store quality.
B00DX879K0|5|Have to say this helmet is great, fits nice and looks good. Was extremely impressed with the fit and how comfortable it is. The retractable shield is a plus and the fact you get a tinted and clear one included. Changing the shields out is a breeze. I have not used the neck curtain yet as it has been in the high 90's with heat index around 105 and this helmet has excellent air flow and keeps you comfortable. For just under 80 bucks this is a great buy.
B00030D1DA|5|Just what was needed!
B005SB0JJI|5|Love these. Lets you open the windows while it is raining. Yet no Rain gets in.<br />Got my parents a set for each of their cars too.<br />Now my dad can smoke in the rain while driving!
B000DZM7FS|5|Best on earth
B010BWQNJS|5|Helpful shipped fast
B000LG8GI6|4|Setup was easy as others have said, price was decent-way less than dealership, and we have a much needed spare to a recently purchased used car.
B000C40SOW|5|truck feels like new again, thanks to all the other positive feedback that swayed me to buy these in the first place
B009S9RCPU|5|Nice
B00LWKO7C4|3|They look good but cheaply made was installing them on the roof of a 89 f250 and one of them broke the led strip inside and had to be glued back in
B00I1B6SK6|5|Awesome product!! Liftgate now pretty much does all the work!
B00EC0ZJD2|5|Great product for the price. It was very easy to install and took about 10 minutes.
B005N53AM2|1|The smell is terrible
B000S2SUQG|5|Product works great. Just had my mechanic install it and everything is perfect. Bought one for my Cadillac Escalade and Mercedes-Benz CLK500.
B005XRPJ0G|4|nice lights, work great.dont sit as flush as the factory lights
B006X8BQIS|5|Fit well. Looks great. Easy 20 min install.
B00KJK88FU|5|go bills!
B00QPQD1NQ|5|Absolutely amazing ... I bought this from reading the other reviews. Had an Audi I neede to sell with a dead battery..... Had our a put a plug in charger on it all day and would not even come close to turning the car over... Then I got this great product in the mail and ban!! Started the car right up ... All my family getting them for Christmas .... Incredible powerhouse in a tiny box .... You won't be disappointed
B00HB9K55S|1|They suck
B000HTS5JC|3|looks good, makes a rattling sound when driving, loosens up frequently, cheesy install kit. if it had just screwed on, it would have been awesome.<br /> Also, about three days after receiving it, one of the caps fell off.
B00173U7D4|5|Love this, just need a short spray. Lasts long time.
B00EPA7BXU|3|Not too Bright as some others
B00COYZHIA|5|Very Happy with these bars. Installation was easy even though the instructions were so-so. Seem to be well built but only time will tell. these bars are nicer than the rhino's I put on my previous truck. Price was nice!
B00KXNRC3M|3|Cheap but bright you get what you pay for. Good replacement for the jeep wrangler if you don't want to spend the money for the stock ones. Will see how long they last.
B005C5H5BK|2|Seems like pretty decent quality for the price but baffles blew out in the first five minutes. For the price it's not bad I would probably buy it again rather than spending 250$ on a magnaflow.
B00KTHYA1O|5|Worked great!
B009VOQ05U|5|Fit perfectly
B00N58KQMQ|5|Love it!  Delivered quickly. Fit great. Very easy to install (at least on mine). I installed on a 2014 Landmark fifth wheel. Now I don't have to worry about giving keys to the kids if we're out walking. I can give close friends the code in case they need to get in when we're not there in case of emergency. I love the remote. Overall works great!  Highly recommended. I kept the old lock and key. If I ever trade the unit I'll simply reinstall the original and put this one on my new one. going to recommend to Heartland (our manufacturer) that they just make this standard equipment on the higher end units.  Just a note:  on my unit I did have to take a screwdriver and remove a little bit of styrofoam in the door opening to make it fit - but no problem and nothing that's going to hurt the door.
B00LBF5AYO|5|Thanks
B00W88C62M|5|These mats arrived and I was very impressed! High quality thick mats that were an exact fit for my car.  The beautiful color definitely dressed up the interior and I have had many compliments!
B0036E9VB6|5|positive side:<br />Quality of the product is rock solid.<br />performance is far better than expected. it fills/top up the tire pressure in seconds not in minutes. it top up my saloon car tire from 20psi to 33psi in just 10 seconds & scooter tires in 3 or 4 seconds<br />the pressure gauge reading was unbelievably accurate. i have cross verified with my VIAIR digital pressure gauge, both are showing same pressure. thumps up to VIAIR.<br /><br />Negative side:<br />Cable length is too short(3 Meters). at least one more meter must be there.<br />i have purchased the separate extension cable 4 feet long( with cigarette lighter plug one side and clips other side) and attached with it.<br />with the supplied 3meter long cable you cant even reach car rear wheels and forgot about reaching stepney tire.<br />the manufacturer must seriously consider to rectify this serious problem.<br />even i have tried to replace the cable with lengthier thick cable by removing the rear panel. but the wiring inside was so complicated so i dropped the idea of changing the lengthier cable<br />the LED light provided is absolutely useless, it cant show any light in darkness. it can be consider only as a power indicator.(VIAIR must improve it for the sake of customer safety)
B0020C9OF8|5|We have loved having these. It has reduced tailgating and eased this mama's mind.
B00H6XPZN6|5|They do their job and are u breakable so far. My son broke the previews roller shades. I'm pretty happy with the product. Easy to put up and take down when not needed.
B0010DZZPG|4|fast delivery works great, I only give 5 stars to amazing products
B004GCDZKU|5|Went on my friends car, looks great, and works perfectly!
B00GSAUHB8|5|Great product. Considerable difference in internal temperature after using.
B001KQF5G2|3|Good brakes. Kinds dusty. Shipping took forever.. ..
B007WPBZUU|5|Bought 6 of these over the course of a year to replace quickly failing old ignition coils in our 2003 Mazda 6S. At this point, 3 of them have been in service for over a year with absolutely no troubles. The boots fit well, but I recommend dabbing some dialectical grease in the ends to help prevent carbon tracks and secondary ignition failures down the road.<br /><br />Will definitely buy these again if I have any troubles.
B001B7D0B2|5|Haven't installed yet but seems like the right part and is high quality.
B003GXMJG6|4|Love this lanyard, unfortunately I've had to buy it 3 times because the little metal piece on the end keeps breaking on me. Most of the time it's my fault, but I do wish it was a little sturdier. Great buy, just be careful.
B008DIYLJC|3|I really like my bling plate cover but I was disappointed that the 3 rows of bling mentioned were only on the top. The rest only had 2 rows, so they need to revise the description
B004MSL37U|5|good

B003RVOQ8G|1|The ley doesnt pair with the car....
B0013ERRSK|3|While this pet watering device is totally unique, it has some flaws.<br />Pros: First, it was the only pet watering device we could find that can be used conviently in the car, without creating spills and messes.<br />Easy to fill, easy to use and almost spillproof.<br />Cons: the &#34;bowl&#34; is almost too narrow and deep for small dogs and most cats to use with ease.<br />We used this on a 500 mile trip with our cat and he could barely reach the water level when the container was filled according to directions - we had to fill it above normal levels in order for Cubby to reach the water on his own.<br />If you tipped it, he could reach it more easily, but do you really want to keep your<br />hand inside a carrier tipping the container so your pet can reach the water for an entire trip?<br />I think it would be very difficult for pug nosed dogs to use.<br />In order for a cat or short nosed dog to reach the water, you have to tilt the &#34;bowl&#34; portion of the container toward the animal.<br />If they would make the &#34;bowl&#34; wider and shallower, it would certainly improve its utility.
B007NQ159Y|4|The product was great and was straight from mopar. The down side two parts were missing, the agent who package the product did not Q/C his work. I called the vendor direct. They were helpful but neede a better system to assist them in their control of logistics and resolving problems. After 5 phone calls it took 3 weeks to get the parts to complete the install.
B00F2GU6U6|5|Super easy to install. The adhesive in the light strips wasn't the best. That's the only problem I had.
B0077S1BBU|5|I received it weeks before expected and was able to fix my gear shifter by myself, and as a girl that's a big thing! All parts were there. I own a 2004 Honda Accord coup and it fit perfectly.
B00H1L5K6U|5|Yea Baby!  80's rule!
B00496GUC8|4|The tables are excellent,  the stand is a little unstable at the base
B00JVWDWPS|5|It lets just the right amount of sun in! Quality material. Doesn't feel &#34;cheaply made&#34;. Holds up while driving on the interstate at 80mph. Not noisy. Doesn't have a lot of &#34;flap&#34; due to how taunt it is stretched.
B003NHH6LI|5|Fast service and worked great.
B000C985YW|4|factory replacement and it works
B00TBHXC4E|4|We have some vinyl covered patio furniture that is in need of some protection from the sunlight and dust.  This cleaner work pretty well on it (and on the vinyl surfaces in my wife and daughter's cars) but you do have to use some elbow grease as you have to keep rubbing until the surface is dry - the product doesn't contain alcohol and I guess that is why you have to work hard to get it to dry.  The results look pretty good considering how long our stuff has been in need of a good clean.
B002N1J5IM|5|I purchased the Vortex 1 to replace a broken fan in my 2004 Dutchman. I needed help holding the fan up during installation and had to use different screws to mount the fan. Once I put the trim back up the fan looked just like it was always there. Less noisy and it moves a tremendous amount of air. Very happy.
B010OQMYD0|5|This is a wonderful product. It is easy to install. I love that it covers more of the window than most of the window shades.<br />It makes a big difference in the temperature in the car especially in this unusually hot weather we have had here recently.<br />I love that it is flexible and folds up for easy storage when not in use.<br />I really like this product. It is a little saggy but the amount of shade it provides is well worth it.<br />*I received this product in exchange for a honest and unbiased review.
B00FGXENSQ|2|Idiot light went out right away<br />Half to feel inThe dark to get to the switch<br />It was noted that the ground wire for the light on the switch needs a resistor spliced in. The power from the main line can short out the idiot light and the suppler did not provide this as a complete kit

B0039O1UWQ|4|Mounting brackets aren't useful for my 1999 Jeep Cherokee. I recommend that you buy stainless steel hardware and rhino line it.
B00PAQKQH6|5|This item was just perfect.  I used my side mirror to get the cup close by and out of the wind and it works great.  Highly recommend.
B00NP60URE|5|Must have if bleeding brakes alone. Quick job with this tool.
B00GBQ3KRW|3|I usually don't get too excited about items until they get in my hands and put to the intended use. This product is no exception. The Lipperrt Jack Stabilizer tool does make access to the T-bolts easier, however, not as one would expect. This tool is cumbersome to get the T-bolts tight enough to stay put which means getting down and doing it all by hand. On the other hand, the tool does make it easier to loosen the T-Bolts resulting in a faster tear down. Al in all this is not a bad product for its almost intended purpose. It was over priced for such a simple piece of metal. Do I regret the purchase? No, I have found it to be better than bending down to break the T-bolts loose, and re-tightening them for storage.  I am all for finding innovative ways to make my job easier for any task. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend this to anyone with Lippert Strong Arm Stabilizer Bars For the price of the Strong Arm Stabilizers, they should have included the tool.
B001GH1OPG|2|To Soft, To much give. should be wider.
B003R7LP7K|3|Was disappointed in the quality of the chrome finish, had a lot of wrinkles that would not smooth out, otherwise  the fit and function were same as the original.
B008FUEYLI|5|5 Star since the Price is RIGHT!!  These are painted black, hopefully they wont fade or I will mark them down to 2 stars.  Looks good!
B0012GTVVA|5|Really like this thing. It is a good investment and nice addition.

B006X98A7C|5|Exact  replacement for back ups 350.  No.trouble installing.
B00KN0UOEE|5|Works real good on our plastic fenders on our Jeep also it cleans our weather tech floor mats... Leaves them a little slick but makes them look new after they get dirty...
B0041HN1HM|1|The collar of the lock is too tall to fit on my fifth wheel hitch. Would have been happy with the lock if it had fit.
B00D8Y762U|5|extends the shine of your wax, easy product to use. Works great on rims! Complements Speed-Shine; if you have a car worth waxing you need this set.
B000EZW69Y|5|A+++++
B009CZEQ8G|5|Going down from 17&#34; to 15&#34; pitch gave my old 18 foot crestliner a kick in the pants for acceleration and got my revs up with 4-5 people in the boat. The 17 gave good performance when only one person was in the boat, but the prop should be sized by typical load, not by nearly-empty performance. Check your engine manual for what the full throttle RPM should be - if its &#34;4500-5500 rpm&#34; then you really should be hitting over 5300 with just yourself in the boat, otherwise you're wasting performance and lugging the engine with a bigger load.<br /><br />Added bonus: This prop isn't bent at the tips, so that gave me some extra performance too.
B00QSGQPRC|5|Great price- works great1
B00F3SU8T2|5|THE perfect and largest oversized filter for 2013+ (5th Gen) Nissan Altima 3.5 sedans (M20x1.5 threads)!<br /><br />This is the largest oversized filter one can purchase that fits perfectly and has factory bypass vlave settings. The std Nissan filter is TINY. Absurdley so. This Bosch L3320 Synthetic filter is the exact same size as the Mobil-1 M1-105 filter, with a slightly larger gasket diameter. The gasket fits perfectly on the mounting plate, but couldn't be even 1/4\\" larger in diameter. Though the filter is longer than the stock Bosch L3300, it is not so long as to touch the plastic splash guard, and is slightly over an inch larger in diameter. The bypass valve setting is compatible (15-18psi of pressure differential; coupled with the additional media surface area and the fact that it's fuly syn media, and you might no need your bypass valve at all above 0 degrees F.) and there is slightly more than DOUBLE the media surface area than the std sized filter (which can fit INSIDE of a coke can if you cut the top off of the can... this is unacceptably small). This is the filter size that WAS used and recommended for the 3.5 V6 in the original 350Z until it was replaced by the 370Z, before Nissan back-spec'd (read: changed retroactively) the 3.5 engine to a smaller filter that fits BOTH the QR25 2.5 liter 4 cylinder and the VQ35DE 3.5 liter V6 for the Altima. One supposes this was done to keep parts stock counts down for Nissan dealers, but it's BAD for the longevity of your car. You want as much filter surface area as possible to keep bypass events (moments when the pressure differential across the filter media increases to the point that the bypass valve opens to prevent starving the engine of oil) to an absolute minimum. The more media surface area, the fewer times you'll go into bypass, the easier it is on your oil pump, and the higher your cold oil flow rate wil be. If you have startup clatter, this filter may fix that as your engine gets more oil, sooner, upon cold startup. This filter flows extremely well, especially when it's cold outside. The L3320 full glass-fiber synthetic media filter flows more oil than ANY other filter that can be mounted to a gen-5 3.5 VQ35DE V6 Altima sedan. Period. It also filters just as finely as a Purolator Pure One, with about 1/4 the flow restriction (i.e. even an oversized PL14459 Pure One will have 4 times the flow resistance to oil as this Bosch L3320 filter). With this much media surface area, 15K filter change intervals are easily attainable with a clean engine and synthetic oil. I will be doing two 5K mile oil changes per filter (changing the filter every OTHER oil change), and playing it ultra safe. Overkill? Sure. But ask me how much overkill it is when I trade this vehicle in at 130K miles for more than blue book value because it runs LIKE BRAND NEW. ;)<br /><br />The full synthetic, glass-fiber, wire-backed media (licensed from Donaldson; it is their Synteq synthetic media, patented) has superior flow characteristics to all paper and paper-synthetic hybrid media (mobil 1, Bosch Distance Plus, purolator pure 1, K&N, etc.) media. This is evidence by a smoother startup and faster RPM drop upon cold startup. Only Royal Purple, Fram ULTRA, Bosch Long Life, Amsoil EaO, Napa Platinum, Wix XP, and Purolator Synthetic use full synthetic media. Synthetic media has superior flow rates to paper filters, even when holding more dirt, as syn media filters in 3 dimensions and traps contaminants across the physical depth of the filter media...whereas paper only traps contaminants across its surface. Synthetic media flows substantially more oil than paper media for the same media surface area...often many times as much as paper.<br /><br />After changing to Pennzoil Ultra Platinum w/ Pure Plus technology 5w-30 (bought on Amazon) and the Bosch Long Life L3320, my Altima now idles just above 600 RPMs, as opposed to 750 RPMs on the previous oil (Mobil 1 5w-30 Extended Performance and a Mobil 1 M1-105paper-synthetic fiber hybrid-blend-media oil filter). The car runs smoother at idle and while accelerating. It also shuts off more smoothly. The engine is literally quieter at all times. The M1 5w-30 XP oil had 1900 miles on it (total miles at end of interval was just under 16k miles on the odometer). This is as much a testament to the Pennzoil Ultra Platinum w/ Pure Plus Technology (Factory Fill for all Ferraris and their race teams, Dodge Viper, Fiat Chrysler SRT, all Chrysler Hellcat engines, All Viper SRT race teams, etc.) as it is to the filter. PPUP is a low-volatility oil and it is highly resistant to elevated teperatures. It was recently compared VERY favorably to Amsoil's Top Synthetic 5w-30 oil by Amsoil themselves....the comparisons are public to view on their product page. The PPUP was neck and neck (and beat the Amsoil in one or two categories) with Amsoil's top synth oil for TBN retention, cold temp flow, HTHS viscosity, High temp burn-off (volatility), oil shear rate, 4 ball bearing test, and overall engine wear. PPUP apparently exceeds Amsoil (and every other currently available oil?) for engine cleanliness. Super important for the ever-increasing ethanol deposits being left by our fuels. Even more important if you have a direct injected vehicle. ULTRA important if your DI vehicle is turbo or supercharged.<br /><br />This Bosch filter is excellent and is a top tier oil filter, offering far better flow AND finer filtration than any factory filter. In a clean engine, and using synthetic oil, this would be capable of much longer than a 10k oil filter change interval. 15k miles if your manufacturer allows. Or two 7,500 mile oil change intervals. Buy with confidence. And the price on Amazon can't be beat. This has M20x1.5 threads and a 15-18psi bypass valve setting.<br /><br />Note: Some would argue that \\"all filters work the same\\". Maybe this is why virtually ALL over-the-road semi-trucks (and also most heavy machinery) are using Donaldson oil filters with their patented Synteq synthetic glass-fiber media...the SAME media you find in these filters listed above (licensed from Donaldson, except FRAM's Ultra, they make their own media). Cuz truckers and trucking companies just LOVE to flush their money down the drain...especially with ever-increasing fuel prices. Be serious. This is called a clue.<br /><br />Be honest with yourself; if you have a lease vehicle and don't care about going past your lease term or you trade your vehicles in at or prior-to 100k miles, then don't bother with this filter. But, if you want to turn your vehicle into a 200k/250k/300k+ vehicle and you want to make it last, then full synthetic filters are for you. Seeing that 80% of engine wear occurs within 60 seconds of startup, this filter serves to greatly increase engine life.<br /><br />Another note for vehicle longevity: Change the Nissan/JATCO CVT transmission fluid EVERY 30k miles with a drain and refill at a Nissan stealership and KEEP YOUR RECEIPTS (the process for fluid change is COMPLEX and is NOT a DIY thing. Trust me). This should be about $320. The fluid is very expensive ($24 per quart or more) and full-synthetic with a special low-viscosity formulation. ONLY use genuine Nissan NS-3 fluid (included in the cost of the above listed drain and refill, it requires about 8 or 9 quarts). Not NS-2 (for earlier CVTs). Not aftermarket fluid. If you live in the mountains, get a B&M supercooler transmission cooler (stacked plate cooler, most efficient type of cooler; available right here on Amazon) and have it installed by the dealership in-line with the factory transmission cooler return-line. Heat is the enemy of this XVT CVT tranny. Keep it cool and it will last 200k+. Let it run hot on worn fluid and you'll experience early failure. You cannot neglect it like older auto trannies...but, in return, you get extremely responsive driving and excellent fuel economy, beating the German ZF 8-speed auto in many VWs, BMWs, Porsches, and Audis. You've been warned.<br /><br />Also, there are some who state that, because virtually all auto oil pumps are positive-displacement pumps, oil flow rate is NOT affected by the oil filter media. I'd ask them to speak to the many hundreds of Hyundai owners who had vehicles with startup rattle even using factory (rock catcher) oil filters. Those same owners only changed to a synthetic oil filter and saw their startup rattle disappear...using the exact same oil. Did all of these forum members have a mass, syncronized hallucination? Or does the oil filter, in fact, make a difference with regard to oil flow? You be the judge.
B000HRX1JS|5|Really great bag. Works well on my Fatboy lo  :)
B00N27KY4A|5|Loved it!! Looks awesome on my car
B004VMP83C|5|Very easy to install. Looks great, actually better than factory installed decals.
B00WV055CK|2|If you are looking for an affordable net for the back of your Toyota, this is a great option.  Keep in mind though, this item is NOT an original OEM Toyota net as advertised in the picture or the ad (with the Toyota tag).  It uses the same part number as the dealer but comes without the Toyota tab and is not a factory Toyota product.  The net secures to the available hooks in the back of the RAV 4 like it should.  It appears to be an oversight on Toyota's part in regards to the connector hooks on the top, they are too fat and the net slides off the hooks fairly easily.  I had a 2014 Highlander and the cargo net was much better and the hooks were very well designed (car was totaled, so I downsized to the RAV 4).
B000E28MTA|5|They fit and they are easy to install.

B000AA89HG|5|Bought these awesome pewter charms as a memorial for our family dogs that have died over the years. Highly recommended
B00GZLR7J0|4|Replacement of the 1st one which came apart after little over 2 1/2 years.  Didn't want to spend $535.00 for the one made for  T@B trailer.
B001DBBTO6|3|not what I wanting
B000R6T8NW|2|Fit and finish isn't as nice as the first one we bought. Lots of casting imperfections. Very rough grinding gouges on it. Doesn't fit the trailer tongue nearly as tight as the first one. I was very happy with the first. Doubt I'll buy another, and can't recommend them any more.<br /><br />I'm wondering if they outsourced production to third world incompetent factories full of impoverished, underaged, starving kids with bowl hair cuts. If not, the production workers and quality control folks should be fired immediately, because this thing is sorry looking compared to the one we bought a couple years ago.
B00I4SPMTY|4|FF370. Works great. Still need to test it on long trips though. What l disliked was soft packaging. Since there's no protection, the pins (included) left visible marks on the product, l assume during s&h. Some might disagree but l consider packaging as part of the product. I think l was lucky the pins didnt actually go trhrough it.
B000CPK39G|5|did exactly what I wanted.
B00M9IFT6G|5|Light weight, comfy/cozy. will order again soon,maybe even 2 pairs, just to have ready for use.
B007KPSBTK|3|its okay
B009OT30AU|5|good product
B003YLIH0C|5|The part was brand new and it got here FAST; however I had to return it, as it was not the right one for my truck
B003ZHU45Q|5|Excellent.  Fit my Tracker Boat 16' trailer - motor/transom support.  The old part lasted 10 years and this part seems more robust.
B00J4FXBN0|4|Great Item, not to bad to install.
B00M9ONUHK|1|This is garbage
B00FXGQ7OO|5|This was an awesome find. They fit nicely on my 06 jeep wrangler with high back seats. They do fade a bit when they are in direct sunlight but for the price these seat covers are definitely worth it.
B00VKX781U|5|They look great, easyTo apply.
B0016I8E1M|5|Sturdy, attractive and heavy. Just like I like 'em
B00BC372EG|5|This helmet is sexy. Get the right goggles and you are badass !!!  Does not try to lift if it fits right.  I've gone 90 mph with no lift at all. Great buy
B00X4I0R80|1|Don't buy these cheap pieces of crap. Installed them like I've done 100's of bearings and they fell apart when I stuck the assembly onto the axle. we'll see if I get my money back.
B00UV5C0TI|1|Don't work on my 2003 ram 1500 and app is hit!
B0085BI120|5|These motocross pants are very nice the color is very detailed good material. The only thing is, don't tighten the buckle too tight or it will break. I wish amazon would get more.
B00OX2GLAY|4|Love the saying on the sticker, and the quality was great, but a very small sticker
B00573N36S|4|Love this but way too short for my windshield sadly.
B004ZG9Z60|5|I got this charger right after I bought my '07 BMW R1200R in 2010. The bike was 3 years old, and the battery had been replaced once. I live in Vermont, so the bike often sits for a month or more without running, in an unheated (below zero) garage. All I do is connect the charger. It's now 2015, and the  battery is still working fine, after at least 6 years. I'm replacing the battery, but only because I figure it doesn't owe me anything, and I don't want to push it any more.
B0013FSTG8|5|These are the best, they take a beating, they sound great, and these guys who made and designed these had the stupendous idea of make the battery compartment require a screw to open, no more searching for lost batteries under seats because the kid dropped them on the ground and lesser quality headphone just pop apart where the battery box cover lets loose. These are a little pricy, but as a professional shopper I have learned the hard way you get what you pay for.
B00D42AFS8|5|This is the 2nd order of this unit I've bought and it works great for jump starting and for use as a USB re-charger. I actually ordered 3, but the order before this one was a packaging mess (loose and un-taped package was missing a lot of parts, most notably the battery clamps!). Since then, I think Amazon and the vendor must've gotten their act together since this one came in a sealed box.<br /><br />Unlike the recommendations to store this in my glove compartment, I always leave it tucked between my car seat and the center console with the USBs accessible and the charge status LEDs visible). The unit is always plugged into one of my two lighter sockets.<br /><br />The reason I set it up this way (always plugged into the car lighter socket) :<br />- the unit provides 2 USB ports for charging my wife's gadgets which also works when the car is turned off.<br />- I can always see the status of the unit's charge (via the LED) compared to if it were in the glove compartment or the trunk.<br />- the unit is always recharging when I go for my usual long drives<br /><br />... bottom line is that barring damage from the constant recharging state (I haven't had either of them fail on me yet after 9 months), I have a jump starter that's almost always in a full state of charge.<br /><br />In contrast, I've had other more traditional jump starters, the kind with the heavy lead-acid batteries. They were bulky and invariably ended up in the trunk forgotten until I needed them, and by then it always needed recharging (which meant lugging them out to the house and an AC socket).
B00DCNQBRI|4|Good quality for the price
B001AIZ5HY|5|Definitely worth the 13 bucks, the headlights look brand new!
B008427D88|3|Tight fit on a honda odyssey/ honda cars.
B00CIVXQIW|3|cheaper than local parts stores, drive car to soften hose on inlet side. Hose is a little oversized for this part, and heating the hose with coolant seals up the leak and space.
B0093NJYJI|3|I cannot fairly judge the jack, because it wint fit under my bike.  My fault.  Make sure you have the clearance for the 14&#34; at rest height.  Once you have this jack its yours.  The shipping costs as much as the stand.  Again my fault.  If anyone close to phx, az wants a discounted stand look soon on C'sL.  I gave it a three, cause i had to gave something, looks like it would work great.
B000FPYA06|3|Picture shows Matt finish but its shiny.
B00DG7ZN1K|5|Real Toyota OEM Body side molding.  The color matches exactly.  Thorough instructions for installation but not for the faint of heart.  If you are not good at mechanical things, ask a friend who is good to install or take to a body shop, because you'll want it to look good once it is on.
B0059JUC9G|5|I purchased the Airhawk Pillion for the ride to the Sturgis Rally in South Dakota. We had two long days of riding there, as well as all the riding we did after we got there and then 2 long days of riding home.  Before the Airhawk Pillion cushion, my inner thighs would start hurting after 2 hours of riding. As a passenger, I had no discomfort the entire trip!  This was the best purchase I made.  I highly recommend this product.
B00X2TUW1I|5|I recently purchased the sun sized window shades. It fits well and provides extra shade (even though my windows are tinted) from the hot California sun. Seems to stick pretty well too! Have had no problems with them so far. Would buy them again. Co-founder of company followed up to make sure everything was ok with the product. Very good customer service!
B00AWU5HPQ|4|Very very nice
B00DKO4P5O|5|Good heavy funnel and cap
B00FKOIY2C|5|good buy
B00BCRMC1U|4|Looks nice on my 2015 Rav4. Gave it 4 because the bad smell from the steering wheel cover.
B004VRLI8G|4|Good smell
B00L84EKI0|1|Does not fit Toyota V8 filter, had to return part.
B000GTUD3E|5|nice
B00RK27IE2|5|Totally happy with product
B006JILCN6|4|Very secure and pretty easy to put on (not completely painless). The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars is that I didn't find the instructions nearly as helpful as a YouTube video. I questioned how secure these could be since they don't wrap around the entire luggage rack bar of the 2006 Honda Odyssey. I drove 3500 miles with a large luggage carrier containing about 150 pounds of gear and at speeds in excess of the limits in the western states and this rack didn't budge.
B004CMMFK0|5|This stuff smells like my mom.
B00P45NG5W|5|perfect fit good price
B00N2D206E|5|works well with our car.
B00881EQ1C|5|Great part using as rear plate holder and works quite well.
B002M477C6|5|Beautiful, clear headlights that work well and fit well.  The price was excellent.
B00080QHMM|3|More accurate that I anticipated.  Easy to read and use.
B001TE0IMG|3|Designed by Cobra as a Disposable Device. Cannot be Owner Serviced.  If you subject it to light use, it will serve you very well as intended and then dome more.   If you subject it to heavy use, and if it failed, you cannot service it.  No user service for the most basic of failures. No manual reset button. No external or replaceable fuses. If it failes, you are out a luck. You can't return it for service. Shipping would cost more than the purchase price.  Do not buy. Look for items with external, manual fuses and reset buttons.
B008G2BJU4|5|I love these replacement headlights! Easy to install!
B008FOJW5C|4|Original and cheaper
B0049C86CO|4|Satisfactory replacement  for original manufacturer equipment.
B0076DUMPC|5|This is the same as OEM.
B000FQ1XNC|5|I think most of the people that have trouble with this may have tried to install it through the hole, which you might be able to do, but I didn't even try it. I just pulled the dash and placed it from the back. The metal tabs must also go on the inside of the box, with the supplied screws being screwed from the inside so that they are pointing out and you can see the screw heads inside the box.
B001KO6D5Q|4|Chrome has started to peel off, but that is par for the course. I would recommend a black one without the chrome plating.... all other features are as advertised
B00D1CQVIY|5|Easy install and works good. Wish the leads were a little longer though
B000C0WKRE|5|It is a belt, there isn't a lot to say.  The diagram on the box was helpful when I forgot the routing. I went ahead and changed it when I had the wonderful radiator go out.
B009FU66FO|5|Made a 3 ton Suburban 2500 drive like it shed 2000 pounds. Very controlled now and wind no longer adversely affects steering. They did break in after around 300 miles of driving and are now softer but still providing good handling (for a truck).
B006O37FVE|5|Just the stuff I needed for my 401 Buick Nailhead motor, to make it live longer.
B0007M30BW|5|Just what I wanted
B00IABE5QG|5|Fits like a glove. Great product.
B00AE1GIAG|1|This does not fit my 2009 Hyundai sonata and did not come with the needed stainless steel shims
B00ATRV3Z0|4|They installed easily and look just like the OEMs. I have 3 complaints but they are common to the OEM model as well. First: The bars end up too close together to safely hold anything long, (Like a canoe). Second: They have no opening or anchor so that anything tied on can be prevented from drifting left or right, (I will be modifying to correct this). Third: They are really shorter than what I need, (A canoe and a kayak).
B000C7TUMU|5|Great price. Fit perfectly. As other reviewers have stated, i had to swap the transmission fittings from the old radiator, but that was no problem.
B00JKPUYXO|5|Excellent product,  exceeded my expectations. Outstanding power delivery and versatile installation options.<br />Though there was initially some confusion as the advertised battery's are yellow, Motobatt has changed some to black due to some battery compartments being visible on some motorcycles. Thusly, they changed them.
B000O51VJ0|5|Love this camp fire
B003ZOH63W|5|Outstanding reception. I am getting twice the number of channels I got before. It installed in less than half an hour. That includes the replacement of the mast and worm gear. I am really glad I chose the unit.
B005I3C00M|5|Awesome comfort will buy again if needed!
B00C5N6GL2|5|Very fun!
B003IOITRG|5|awesome unit
B005SB6S3Y|4|Took a couple of hours to get hooked up and leveled out. so far only used on short trip, seemed to work well pulling approx. 6500lbs. Used this for a 2100 mile trip this last week, made a huge difference in how the trailer handled behind my expedition. It smoothed out the ride and the sway control made a huge difference also.
B008KZKI04|5|Exactly as described, genuine, perfect fit, however I ordered the wrong color.  Return was easy except I had to pay shipping and restocking fee.  Ordered the brown color I really wanted.  Very happy with them!
B00DJBQ1SW|4|So far, used it only twice, works as advertised.  Easy to handle and set up.  I unloaded and loaded into a SUV a lawnmower and a power washer.  Someone had remarked on sharp edges, but I was wearing light gloves anyways to handle machines so no problems.  I agree the straps are low quality and will need to be replaced quickly.  This is only reason I downgraded it to 4 starts.  Did not notice any problems with the bolts.
B001CO182C|5|My previous MAF had completely failed, and had generated erroneous codes.  As soon I installed a new MAF engine problems ended and gas mileage improved.
B0057B57EG|5|Perfect fit for my '96 Camry. My mom drove it and hit a trash can -- busted the glass. If she does it again I know where to get another. Mirror that is.
B00U05XVOC|5|I had to do a little reworking on the ID, but other than that it works very well for its intended use.
B00HVI1468|5|Perfect!
B00MO0JPH8|5|Very nice so far....The items seems sturdy and the double sided tape seems strong. I have run the car through the automated car wash on a number of occasions now and the emblem is still in place and looking good. Beware of cheaper versions which uses poor quality tape.
B001UCGPVU|5|WORKED LIKE A CHARM FOR MY 2002 EXPLORER
B0048E43E8|3|they are nice, send and third row fit perfectly.  front front they seam small and don't cover the whole area.  Look like good quality, but because of the size in front, I wouldn't buy them again.
B009UKUUWE|5|Great product
B002R0O30Y|4|Good price
B0007ZAJRM|2|1997 volvo 850r, 150k miles and had 2 rough shift points. Both were a slamming into gear sort of shift under heavy or moderate acceleration.<br /><br /> this is the second time I've driven the car and the first thing I noticed when I took it for a drive the first time was the biggest hard shift between the first and second gear almost completely disappeared and the rest of the shifting points pretty much sped up to where it was about a hundred percent faster. I was still thinking im imagining things, till i couIdnt replicate  anything or get the car to shift poorly anymore, i had done a fluid change prior a few months ago with no improvement and added lucas trans fix to that but nothing happened. Its weird i ran into a few forums online and lubegard was the only one who had a real fan base. I've never had any additives actually work for me and I've used most on different parts of the cars I've had. Only power steering stop leak works in my experience. It's a snake oil industry to 99% of everything available. It appears this is the 1% that actually does something. Now I don't know what the problem with my granny was to begin with to know why it even worked. So I can only imagine someone else having no effect and it varying between uses.<br /><br /> the transmission shifts so much more quickly and smoothly that I just hope that it actually lasts, but time will tell. I seen alot of fake reviews with products like this one, in fact I think alot of them are actually.  Im still in disbelief, while the transmission has improved a ton it's about 80% of perfect, which is still crazy<br /><br />UPDATE :<br />after prolonged driving, it appears its back to its old ways, just as i initially thought before i got my hopes up. now its not a terribly bad transmission to begin with, so perhaps there is the possibility for better results however, just like the rest of the additives on the market i can no longer say they do anything Sadly
B000EDUUH6|5|This worked very well, Easy to install only 5 minutes. Kept our new puppy from damaging the screen.
B000C541AI|5|High quality better than OEM
B000AP0APA|4|Good price.
B00U7U4MVG|5|Worked fine
B004DRVQYK|4|Extremely bright (non-LED) headlights.  The adjustment screws can take a while to get right, but be patient and aim them properly and you'll be VERY impressed with these headlights.  I love driving at night with these guys.
B00009PGNS|5|My son loves this and uses it all the time.
B00CF2810W|5|The lights are grate I dident know how it was goin to go but they turned out to be the best set of lights I have bought..they are really bright and I love the color,will buy again
B007577UQS|5|Great
B00QRHDIPY|5|I'm using my panel for a trailer winch battery to keep it topped off when not in use. Works great and, its very rugged. My battery is 1000amp marine battery and it's fully charged after about 2-3 days (depending on conditions).
B0094FG4HK|4|You pay for you get, it was 25 bucks. The paint does flake off easily but then again it is a front lip so it shouldnt really matter as it will get damaged anyway. Would definitely recommend for anyone looking for a cheap lip that looks good and is durable. Included mounting hardware is also a big plus.
B00ATZG6D6|5|On time and as expected, haven't installed yet.
B00F0YASQ2|5|So far it has proven to do its job wonderfully.  By far cheaper on Amazon than what they sell it for at car audio shops.  I am pleased with my order...
B00V3YYPR6|5|Awesome.
B009PN7AUQ|3|Was easy to install no problems since install
B00H6ETIWY|5|All I expected....recommended to my brother...he bought a set and also very satisfied....
B00KY0J6D8|5|Installed this Starter in under 30 minutes after having the original Starter already out. Its real simple just two bolts and then bolt on the power connector to the Solenoid, the same way the original Starter came off this one goes on. This Starter is quieter (as it is new) and has worked excellent so far.
B00C9V4EHI|5|DID NOT FIT BUT NO FAULT OF COMPANY
B00CC18LDS|5|Wife loves them in her 2014 Encore.
B001N72FES|5|A well made product that will help eliminate run down batteries is some of my collection of military vehicles.
B00PANW6K4|5|The item delivered was exactly as described and looks great in the car.
B004A35K76|5|Super fast delivery.  Works as it should.  I bought this to replace the exact same original model which was damaged when I accidentally connected the coach to 250V instead of the normal 125V on an out of state trip.  I had Amazon Prime ship to the campground and received it in two days.  Could not have asked for more!<br /><br />On a side note, after removing the cover on the old converter, I discovered the damage was limited to a MOV and a fuse.  I replaced both and now have a spare converter.
B00UA3SVEO|5|Arrived very quickly less than 3 days after purchase. Packaging kept radiator well protected. I used this radiator in a 2003 Denali to delete the oil cooler. Quality is great but I didn't think about it being narrower. Its about 3 inches difference I run 2 aftermarket E-Fan's I had to change to a push pull set up. Engine runs about 190-200 where it would run 210-215. AC even blows colder.
B001EAQTRI|5|Does exactly what it's said to do. Completely eliminates any static even with the AC on, high beams and the volume cranked up. My only regret is that I didn't get it earlier. I have an aux cable from the dollar store and works great!
B003CT4DA4|5|Awesome tool for hanging doors. Have hung up to 4ft heavy doors with it without any problems.
B0058J4YN2|2|Had to modify fiberglass housing, looked great but not very bright
B004O844EM|5|Just as described!!
B005345DBY|2|Wasn't as warm as I had hope for, but that wasn't your fault, just needed some for 25* and below.
B00FF0K8FM|1|As soon as I put on the 3rd coat, the entire thing was ruined. The material completely spread out and became splotchy and gross looking and now will not peel off. The second coat was still clear and a solid piece, but now thanks to the directions the entire thing is ruined and I can't peel it off.
B00TEA5PZC|1|Very disappointed.  Waste of money.<br />I installed the this around my plate. Somr of the scre hiders were snug. But after driv8ng for 2 days 2 have already fallen off.... gone. So unfortunalty since i do not have all of the parts i cannot reutn this product.
B006GFLI0O|4|Good quality, but the band it a bit too thick.
B000JFNAMQ|5|Excellent scale, build quality and delivery.
B002HXSBI6|5|Excellent product,look real good
B006YVWK2U|5|Exactly as described, fit perfectly in my 2010 Audi A4.
B00GHT8NM0|5|Direct fit replacement. It's a little stiffer than the original and may last a little longer but still plastic! Don't waste time calling a dealership, they &#34;will NOT&#34; sell just the latch assembly but will offer the $220+ console lid assembly only.
B00JASCNEE|5|These are great ! I installed a 2&#34; receiver on my 18' trailer for a bike rack and reading about the 4&#34; bumper and problems with the weak welds I ordered and installed these safety struts which maybe took about 15 minutes .Now I am  confident to hang my bikes on the trailer knowing everything is beefed up
B00E6M2C2M|5|Excellent fit and looks good. Made us see the need to clean the other lense.
B00784VDMU|1|Very poor and cheap quality the brackets would not line up. Sent it back and still haven't received a refund!
B00EQMORRK|5|Easy order. Delivered quickly. Easy and clean install.  Many compliments of how sharp and good the rotor and caliper look on truck.  After first week of use I am very satisfied with the purchase of these brakes for my 2005 chevy silverado.
B000JFHNEC|5|The AC in my truck is now working...
B000S2QF6I|5|Thank you . Saved my life
B0110CO95S|5|Good product! had a variety of stickers that we easy to peal off<br />5 stars!
B007TG7ILC|5|Big fan of Bosch.  Long time user.  I highly recommend.
B00MV61AKA|5|Exactly as pictured, came in an envelope.
B006G3W4J0|4|The original mirror had 3 silver prongs to hold the mirror in place.  This mirror came with 2.  We used 1 prong from the old one and hot glued them all in place as the prongs slid out easily and didn't stay in place.  After the modification, the mirror fit well into the bracket.  It was a little hard to install as it needed placed and then slid into place.  Seems to be holding well.  Not a full 5 stars for the missing prong.  We didn't contact the seller.
B00KRHX4A4|5|just what i was looking for
B002YKNXKS|5|A+
B00891HBS6|5|replaced a broken mount with this. went it easy worked exactly as expected
B00P2QAAG6|1|Terrible. It is fine if you drive a refrigerator, as that is the only thing this sticks to! WILL NOT STICK to any car we tried.  We had to use duct tape (lovely) and order a regular bumper sticker. When the sticker arrives, Ill throw this piece of junk away, and hope the tape doesn't take my paint with it!
B000QJG1IA|5|Great deep mellow tone on my 06 5.4L F150. I ran my pipes straight out the back. I bought the Super 10 at first and the in cab drone was obnoxious. The Super 44 is perfect, noticeable but not annoying.
B003UXZ6RG|1|I bought because I thought it was made of ANY material other than one that causes cancer (and smells like it does also) , right there on the back label &#34;Contains products known to cause cancer&#34; - I threw it away since the entire return process takes as much money as the product is worth. And HORRIBLE HORRIBLE smell -it has that dirty cigarette ashtray smell- [edit: found silicone wheel cover is non toxic, no smell, and sticks just perfect ]
B00BMJF1VG|5|Perfect fit
B00C5T9R8K|5|Great filter
B00H9QIJ5G|4|Great looking, solid made.  Would have given it 5 stars, except for just the slightest bit smaller where they mount up, nothing too drastic though.  Definitely keeping them on the bike.
B002N5JAO2|3|When they say you don't have much time when mixing the two chemicals they see very serious it us much easier to have two people to do this, one for the majority of the work and one to put the fiberglass patch on. And yes it gets very hot.<br />I put it on today I will make an update in a year if all goes well, if I have trouble before then I will then post ahead if time.<br />After giving it a few days it has let loose, the problem is that the epoxy does not mix well or easy, once it us mixed it is hard to make it to the repair at hand, it set well in the bag but not on the tank, definitely needs better packaging fit the job.<br />It looks like the epoxy us a JB weld style chemical better to go to the auto parts store and get the JB weld double syringe and use it with a piece of your own fiberglass patch.
B00BITKV5G|5|This switch looks and works perfectly.
B00CA6UTV2|5|Easy install great fit on 2014 Polaris Ranger 900.
B003YJJS2U|3|Cover is well made and appears durable however is too small to fit.  Check sizes carefully
B00BF8N6Q6|5|Long time user of Bosch.  Never had a problem.  I recommend.
B00AQ29DRS|5|They look great- much better than you would expect from their low cost. Would have liked some instructions as it took a few minutes to figure out that the notch on the retention ring should point outward and be placed over the valve stem. They only fit flush when put on in this way.
B002N5YF2O|5|works good
B00OVBBOTK|5|NICE bars. Easy to install and provide great protection coverage. Includes all required mounting hardware ( 4 bolts, 4 washers, and 2 bolts).
B0027URE9G|4|Used it once so far, held up and worked good. Only issue is the slop where you hook your clevis, but my clevis was decent sized and even though it moves around it isn't enough that the cable could fall off the wheel. I actually prefer a bigger mounting hole for more options. Personal preference though.
B00QKWE530|5|looked good after  applying, great product.  It was really easy to apply. The only one in town.
B00KTHZVFI|5|Very good item i love it
B001AWHTBA|5|Works great
B005DOQYNU|5|Great lights at a great price. Super easy to install and the instructions were spot on. I thInk I guessed right about 50% of the time on polarity and had to flip them around. But they look great in my 4Runner and they are much better than the bulbs they replaced.
B00CFSZSK2|5|Easy to install and great quality product I love it and will continue to.
B000PDI1E4|5|I ordered the wrong mat. I should have gotten a 2007. The mats were alright.
B001P3035I|4|Not much ice in panels.. Best used with snow suit and Hood to conserve cold..
B00GB85ZQ4|4|Item exactly as described, fast shipping, ready to install. The only reason I give it four stars instead of five is the packaging was missing one washer (easily replaced) and the wiring was very short (less than 10 inches). Overall both problems not a very big deal, but I would have preferred to know about the wiring before hand.<br /><br />Overall I am very happy with this light. It is very bright, has a very wide beam and draws very low amperage. I mounted it on the front of my hunting boat and have had no issues. I would say average distance on the light is well over 100 yards with great visibility.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this product.
B0002JMF98|5|As advertised. But way too expensive
B001VMYBAQ|5|Fits like original.
B000VAZVRG|5|Worked great had no problems with shipping
B000FQ033S|2|Screws worked fine but far too expensive.  I bought four screws to mount a bumper extension on my Jeep.  The four screws cost more than the extension.
B00E63TI32|5|Had my 64oz for 6 months now and I love ❤ it!  If you have long days at work or at the park for a sporting event this is great! With my 40oz I would refill 3 maybe 4x's with this 64oz I refill just once.
B0097NIXU0|1|There were 11 supernovas, it doesn't have Zoro! Smh
B000RG41HK|5|Awesome
B003M8FJ4E|3|Product is great, works as advertised. My only problem lies with the fact that the front deflectors are not packaged as securely as the rears and both sides arrived scuffed. Unfortunately I didn't realize this until a few weeks after receiving them as I needed to wait until my windows were tinted before I installed them.
B00DKFQGXW|5|This wrap is great I did the whole interior of my car and it looks like real carbon fiber. This is the best carbon fiber wrap I have ever come across.
B000WJX3R6|4|Good packaging, been holding up, I have purchased this brand for all my smaller batteries, seem to hold up, just be smart about it and make sure you don't have a drain on the system and take care of the machine and the batteries hold up.
B00DZ3592S|5|Works Great!!! Perfect fit!!  on my 95 Honda Shadow VT1100 C2, Starts up with no problem just what the bike needed
B000JZL11S|5|Fit and worked as it should.
B0068G03YS|1|Not happy. Didn't include the metal sleeve as shown, nor does it say in the description anywhere &#34;bushing only&#34;.
B00M9ONRR8|1|This is garbage
B003FBV8ZW|5|You can't beat a deal like these. Sturdy glasses and comfortable.
B003YCMQCG|5|Really great, quality towels!
B003LIRMCM|5|Quick delivery and a good fit. Speedometer works, and needle does not jump. As good as NOS.
B000SDVEU4|5|Great purchase! Heavy duty. Gives us peace of mind.
B0057B5YIK|5|Fit great I should have ordered the heated one but didn't know it was that way.
B00PHFTD6K|3|Fitment is alright at best, the mounting area doesn't make contact with the trunk as the corners are curved in too much, requires a bunch of work for proper fitment. The finish is terrible, we had to glaze the entire spoiler and block out the entire thing in order to get a nice surface for paint. In the end, it's to be expected as this is not from the original designer and is a replica. You get what you pay for and its a great price for what you get
B0017OYR2K|5|PERFECT - EXACT FIT AND NOW STEERS AS NEW
B011SPPN98|5|Wow!!coffee!! espresso<br />This is great air freshener i've ever bought this before.!!awesome~~<br />I love coffee so much.<br />finally i found this air freshener,perfect to fit on cup holder.and has two in the box.wow 120days last long. Definally worth it !!<br />Smell coffee in my car every in the morning~~<br />Great air freshener!!
B00D7T4LX8|5|gave it to my youngest daughter at the same time I gave her the ones for her girls.
B00F1ULT68|5|Perfect Fit - Great Protection
B00O92T1NC|5|Great product!  I use it to carry supplies for my dog.
B000C40SR4|5|truck feels like new again, thanks to all the other positive feedback that swayed me to buy these in the first place
B00CG5RYEW|5|cant wait to use it lol
B001AJH1HK|5|Reasonable price.  Arrive in two days.  Attaches easily.  Unique ratchet cinches mirrors securely.  No vibration going down the road at 55.<br /><br />Very pleased.
B00RZ4Z3GK|3|Plastic--not for boating or tough places. The locking screws are too weak.
B000PUK1J0|5|Wonderful condition, fit perfectly.
B003W8P1C4|5|Perfect; Exactly what I wanted! I did choose to use duct tape to tighten the fit in the receiver.
B00R701RM6|4|its been a great charger and power source.  I don't think I needed the pure-sine, over-kill for my purposes.
B00I2I104C|5|The bulbs all fit except for the map lights which on my vehicle are on a circuit board.  Those that did fit are much brighter then the originals.  It is as much light as I want for the interior and for the price can't be beat.
B001CZUQNI|5|Use these on my 2008 Night Train (2nd set). No issues, no dust and stop well.
B001FAGKBC|3|Had them for a year now and they are all ready for retirement. Install is a headache
B000OAXP6M|3|Put it on and the next day it started turning the chrome yellow
B008NEM4RM|4|Fitment required slight adjustment. However, still satisfied with product and recommend.
B002XM56MA|2|This is an affordable camlocks but its quality is the worst.
B00NJ903MY|3|Not as bright as I had expected for 50W...
B004GCMWFY|5|Fit perfectly
B00DHVK7SO|3|I wish I could wear them, but they squeeze my glasses to my face. I can not imagine any glasses smaller then what I am wearing. I am looking now toward using stick on bifocal lenses.
B000FPYAFQ|5|Fit just like original equipment works great
B00LX6QI0G|5|This sticker is more truthful than you would realize.<br />I can't tell you how many times I was tempted to drive off road.
B00480N154|5|Delivered on time. works well.  Could have had more packaging material in the box.  The inside original packaging was broken but the product was good.
B000EOMZOG|5|This cover fitted like a glove on my 2015 Tacoma  6 ft long bed. It is slightly elevated above the truck bed giving the truck an extra sportiness. Very high quality cover.  Word of advice... an extra set of hands required.
B002YKIVUA|5|This cover is made of good fabric. It fits nice and snug. The price is reasonable for the quality of thr cover.
B00CLEVRW8|5|Nice idem!
B006YU7G8E|5|Wouldn't use a non-OEM fluid, EVER.
B00JKG19EG|5|Worth the money!! Perfect fit for my 2007 Dodge Caliber. I'm a very happy customer :) thank you
B00NGEOFEO|5|would order again
B00GA3BC62|3|Marginally better wind flow above 65mph. Got flipped side to side in South Dakota winds. Fair at best.Would not buy again
B0031GWMI8|5|This is an exact drop-in replacement for the original Motorcraft switch on my 2000 F150.<br />This part costs over $100 at my local NAPA store.
B00W31VMYC|5|As described, easy to use.
B002W2V19I|5|Nice very fast shipping
B00G620ZVU|5|Great lighting. Mounted firmly to the rear bumper, and wiring was simple. Extremely bright for work lights and backup lights where there's no lighting at all. Also the Lamphus Cruizer light bar lens covers snap over these perfectly. Highly recommended.
B000I04Z7Q|5|Had this a few months now, it works amazing i will so recommend this.
B00KTIBY4Y|5|VERY NICE PRODUCT FOR REASONABLE PRICE - MAKES OLD KEY FOB LIKE NEW!
B002Q2M8NW|4|Truck sounds great. It really opened up the exhaust on my 5.3 Silverado. It's not too loud, and works well for a daily driver. I'm in a neighborhood with other houses close by and I didn't want something so loud it would wake the neighbors... But once I'm out of the neighborhood, I can goose the throttle a bit and really begin to hear the engine. Right now the truck is just a hint quieter than some of the other replacement cat-back systems.
B00DGVRXD2|5|Good way to keep using your old gas cans that are still good. Sorry EPA.
B00TXVGLVO|5|Hope people read it on my bumper, and GET THE MESSAGE !
B00F1UM8PE|5|Perfect Fit - Great Protection
B0049PMBCM|3|I'm very please with the performance of this kit, although it has only been a few days. My main complaint is the same as several others. I realize this is a big heavy chunk of metal, but the box was really beat up when I received it. The other really big complain I have is that the wrong clutch alignment tool was sent in the kit...the splines on the tool were completely different than the clutch/trans making the tool useless. Thankfully, the Mini cooper does not use a pilot bearing setup, so I was able to center the friction disk just by feeling around the edges of the pressure plate with my fingers. It's only a few extra dollars to oder this kit from one of the well known performance vendors and based on these few things, I'd probably go that route next time.<br /><br />Tip: If  you are going through the trouble of replacing the clutch, make sure you install a new rear main seal as well as the throw out bearing guide tube and clutch fork bushings.
B004HO745E|5|Exact replacement part, genuine Hyundai part for a lot less than other places! Didn't fix my car, but not the parts fault.
B002Q7SG4W|4|Bought these from Amazon. Arrived in perfect condition. Tried un-bolting the drivers side lower mount first. I could NOT remove it. I tried using my Earthquake brand 1/2&#34; impact wrench with 650' lbs. of reverse torque, nothing. Did this after reading about how the driver's side is the most difficult. So before trying, I sprayed PB blaster, liquid wrench on the bolt and nut hoping it would help, nope. I used my 1/2&#34; drive long breaker bar with a 3' long jack pipe on the end, and I managed to get 2 clicks for every agonizing sweep of the set-up. Men, don't try this at home. I spent 2 hours like this after giving up and being sore for 3 days after. Just brought my 2004 Ford Explorer to Modern Tire. They tried their impact wrench, penetrant, torch and gave up saying they will have to cut the bolt and nut assembly off of it, and pickup and install new bolt and nut. This is the problem they said, &#34; The bolt where it goes through the bottom strut corroded&#34; so be fore warned.  Just drove home with the new struts, and they seem proper for this vehicle. This Explorer IS a heavy suv and they soften out the bumps better than my old ones. Just the right amount of dampening action for pot holes.
B005Z541CI|5|Great quality. Fast shipping.
B003VDX5D2|4|I am a lone female PU driver/ RVer. These steps are terrific. Easy up an down went to a tire shop they were nice and installed the steps for me I didn't want to take a chance on messing my truck up. No problem moving heavy stuff around in my PU now
B000C13UDQ|5|This was a perfect fit for a 1998 Dodge Caravan.  Everything was carefully thought out.  Very easy to install.  I will definitely look for this brand if I ever need to replace another one.  It was a breeze!
B0002U2V1Y|5|Easy to use... Removed contamination from paint surface
B004ZG9Z60|5|It works perfectly out of the box, plug and play for 2007 BMW K1200GT motorcycle battery charger.
B00FS8MI6S|5|good price . to large for my mower and not much adjustment.
B00S3XMSY2|5|This little device totally saved me. I broke my wrist and won't be able to use it fully for weeks. But meanwhile I am a single working mom. I need to drive! With snap on design, installation was easy. Now I can drive easily and with much greater security than if I had to take my hand off the wheel repeatedly to turn. Parking and turning is a breeze.  The only thing I was not prepared for is that it is still pretty tiring driving with one arm. The device helps me turn, but I still feel as though I am having to control the weight of the car with my one good hand. So I do not think I would rely on this for long car trips.
B004A93GGW|5|Most comfortable helmet I've ever owned. Very satisfied.
B00BDEP5ZM|5|Valerra V23128 Pure Power Blue REALLY WORKS!!!...use in your RV's black & gray water holding tanks. Just pour 2oz. in to our 40 gallon black tank not only keeps the odor controlled for weeks (since using Power Blue there's no more &#34;stink&#34; even in the heat of summer when our  trailer is closed up and unoccupied during the week)..And it actually seems to help break down the single ply paper as well.  Power Blue takes care of any sink drain/trap odor in the gray water system as well!!  Follow instructions to amount needed per size of holding tank. If your worried add 1oz. more than recommended the first time, but you will quickly learn a little goes a looooong way!!!  I purchased the 1gallon concentrate size earlier this spring and have only used a little more than half the bottle so far.
B000YC7GA6|4|This switch works well for my air horn installation. It is a great alternative to the large governor setups I have seen. It is small enough you could keep a spare on hand if needed.
B001L4KIHE|1|Don't order them bars arrived beat to hell
B000CIOW54|4|Works as advertised!
B0002Q83X8|4|This solenoid works well for my air horn installation. I bought it specifically because it comes with an integrated mounting bracket. It bolts nicely to my compressor mounting bracket, right alongside my relays. I would have preferred it to be black instead of chrome.
B00B51ZWCO|5|35yrs.ford.tec.work.perfit...than.you.very.much
B008RACMHE|5|Fits like a glove and is of high quality. Will purchase for front axel.
B011P4DQBY|5|Easy and incredible!  It is super easy to use and safe for glass, bumpers, paint and wheels. I used it on all of that. You just spray and wipe it off. I used it on my Jeep and my ford truck. It left a bright shine and didn't streak. I used it in the morning when it was shady. It did storm and it worked out well. It beaded up great..I used it with a pad and buffed it up good. It is smooth and shiny now. Love it! One bottle does around 4 jeeps. This is a five star rating. It is 16 ounce. I used it on our Harley Davison and RV too! I received this product for free in exchange for my unbiased review. Arrived quickly and was securely packaged.
B000XEGEWG|5|These really help keep my screens and glasses clean and also are gentle on surfaces..  JLS
B0087XOTWW|5|These led bulbs work just great!  Cannot beat the price.  I installed all of the light bults in y RV with  Saved lots of money on these than paying for them thru Camping World.
B00OLZ2YMW|4|Very nice cap. I thought it was black buts it gray. Still very nice. Looks good. Wearing it whenever I'm in my CTS alone.
B0082COAHW|4|Almost OEM quality, but at this price it's hard to complain. They fit tightly on the rims. This is a 2008 A8L, much easier then taking the old ones apart, sanding and painting.
B002HMYW4E|1|Don't fit well, Really loose on 2006 Jeep Wrangler. If it rains it holds water above seats. Followed instructions to install probably going to have to modify to make it work right.The tinted windows are nice.
B007WZS41I|5|Tried these on several long trips in the Odyssey Van. Kids say they work great, fit better than the original and the adjustable volume easy to engage. So far, so good!
B00K2OV0MG|5|These Rein motor mounts are equal to factory at 1/3 the cost.  My 996 handles and feels like new.
B00RBQ6HS0|5|More than I expected.  Very good product
B00OCEFQGS|3|works great but it pumps grease out 2 small holes near the hose connection.
B006R777TW|5|Does it come with one or with all of em
B00KN2ITS0|5|Meet expectations and more. Delivery was speedy
B00D2DS50Y|1|This is some bull s*** i only got on and it wasnt even in the box where is my other one at
B000AY4NZO|5|Very happy!!!
B00AZ4R2HK|1|The shape of the front ones barely fit on and the back ones I couldn't even use because they didn't even line up. Horrible purchase. Plus the tape strips suck fron
B007K1MOW4|2|not as big as expected.  maybe I didn't read the entire description clearly, but the weather stripping on the doors to my vehicle are easily three times the diameter of this stripping.  I'm sure I can find some other use for it somewhere.
B00VJBERIK|1|I replaced 16 of my inefficient G8 endear cabinet bulbs with these LED bulbs because I wanted to cut down on the heat and conserve energy.  I was excited to see that we could now get G8s in LED and ordered 18.  The first time I tuned the lights on I had one of the 16 bulbs flashing slowly.  I replaced it and the next day I had two flashers.  I was pissed at myself for buying so many of these bulbs.  The next day the ones that were flashing were no longer flashing, but others were.  I tired of the flashing reminder that I wasted almost $200 on junk that doesn't work.
B00N2E4B1A|5|Good product! Need to be anodized not painted
B00CFH9LO2|5|This works exactly as advertised.  After reading the other reviews I was concerned the alarm wouldn't be loud enough:  I'm certainly glad it isn't louder as my ears are still ringing from testing it.  The setting of combination, use of cable, setting of sensitivity, etc. are easily performed.  Getting the four batteries installed was a little tricky (the polarity is indicated in the plastic bottom of the battery compartment).  Excellent product strongly recommended.
B000K02BEI|5|exact original manufacturer's replacement
B00KZJQ2L2|5|Fits my 1997 F-150 great. If u measure before ordering, u will get a good fit.
B00LJ3BYRK|5|Perfect!! Is what it is!
B00RFUY6XU|4|I am a serious DIY person, and have used this tool one time since my recent purchase. It seems to me to be a great tool for todays complex automotive systems. My use so far has been limited, but judging by what I have also seen on You Tube it is a incredibly capable tool for the money. I enjoy being able to help family and friends with their vehicles too.
B001FANRLS|5|I got these for my 2013 Jeep Wrangler an am very happy with the results.  I had no issues getting them installed and am pleased with the fit.  Will work great for my vehicle.
B00JXZJBDU|5|Thank you!!!
B00L5NIM42|5|These are great!<br />There's nothing more handy than these whips to yank on.
B00192HPOC|5|Perfect fit.  I used three fasteners on each in order to hold them tighter.
B00WH1ZC80|5|These little hook work great,I have a mini van and these hooks help keep all of your bags in one place.Instead of all over the inside of the Van.
B000CPI5ZK|5|Help alot with the race car getting too hot with just water
B008K7ZIFW|5|This fob works great. Compared to what a dealership will charge you can't beat the cost.
B002IC1VHY|1|did not fit 2008 yaris return pump did not line up hose is short but thats not the problem look at pics
B006MIX7U4|5|Very good look and superior quality. Would definitely recommend.
B00CFX6J3M|5|Good quality. .I would recommend.
B001CF3ND8|4|Looks great, holds a lot of gear. A bit of a pain to install though.
B0041CA8RI|3|Nice quality did not fit 13 570 ranger
B000JZ79NC|5|Worked perfect in our 1999 Jeep TJ 2.5L.  We installed new LED tail lights but they flashed fast as if they were burned out.  This fixed it up perfectly.
B002969BQW|5|Awsome stuff.
B003E22UCC|4|No issues, but in conjunction with new Centric rotors,  the initial bite is much softer than previous combination of OEM rotors and pads
B004TNL724|4|Very nice and thick only problem was I thought I was getting 2 like the picture.  Other than that very nice product.
B00L2QM806|5|easy and work well.
B00SDFY7P8|5|Does what I expected it to do.
B006O8636W|5|good link, it does what it is supposed to do.
B0032H6QJ2|1|The product did not meet my expectation it was too difficult to install, I had to contact you and Bestop before I could not have gotton it to work will never ever buy another Bestop product, or purchase anything from Amazon again, Very bad experience.
B000VKVC38|4|No issues -  soft bite  - have yet to try high speed stop.
B007Y87UYK|4|Works good so far.
B000FW2NFS|5|First, I purchased this through a local store - Not Amazon.<br /><br />I like the style of the knob and it's size fits well in my hand.  As for the lights, I could care less.  What I do care about though is the that the mounting sleeve is so short that the knob sits higher than stock.  I am about to go out and change that with a little customizing surgery.<br /><br />The other annoyance is that it makes rattling noise ALL THE TIME.  As I take it apart, I hope to discover what is causing this and fill it with goo.  If that prevents the lights from working - even better.<br /><br />Edit:<br /><br />I was able to modify the insert sleeves; chopping the top off one and opening the inner diameter of another (luckily the other that had a inner diameter that could be widened).  After this modification, I was able to set the knob lower on the shifter shaft.<br /><br />At the same time I disassembled the head (remove the screws in the head) to find the light circuit and remove it.  Putting it back together, I was able to tighten down the screws enough to stop the rattle.  If in the future the screws loosen, a little thread locker will do the trick.
B00BTSKR6Y|4|Works good
B00UG52P7U|4|We took a 6 hour car ride that turned into 8 hrs...ugh, traffic!  I'm so glad we bought the organizer, it really came in handy.  I know some others complained about the bottom not having a tie-down, but it was a non-issue for us.  I will say, our iPad is in an otterbox cover and in order for it to fit the pocket, we had to take the &#34;outter rubber layer&#34; off and managed to squeeze it in. I wish I could keep the entire case on, it's a pain to take off and on.  When we put our Kindle Fire HDX (larger sized one with no case) in the pocket the &#34;top opening&#34; of the pocket would lean forward.  Before we left on are trip I had noticed this and attached 3 small pieces of Velcro to the top to help secure it.  While this worked for our trip, I had used the &#34;sticker type&#34;...needless to say, with high heat in the car, the Velcro eventually came off.  Guess I'll need to sew them on, or maybe try sewing little snaps instead.  It was nice having the extra pockets for toys for our 2 1/2 year old that were easily accessible.  We will be taking this organizer with us on a car/plane trip at the end of the month.  We'll see how it works out.  I'm hoping I'll be able to use it on the plane, but won't know if it will work or not.
B003172FXO|5|Awesome product, fits the passenger seat great on every sport bike I've tried so far
B009K4H42Y|5|genuine filter. made by filtec. would buy again.
B006H34AE6|5|My sofa and loveseat are a chocolate brown corduroy material. Two of my cats are light haired. Because of the silicone nature of this brush, it gathers the hair from the furniture in sort of a rolled up fashion and allows me to easily vacuum it up. This is a big help in keeping my furniture clean. It can be used to collect hair on its own, but in shedding cycles, the vacuum is needed. It is priced very well too.
B00SUNH7GY|5|This kit is far better than I expected, especially for the price!<br /><br />First off, the packaging is nice, a nice outer box with two sturdy boxes inside to hold the product. This might not seem like a big deal, but after I've ordered other things in the past and had them show up wrapped in plastic wrap, this is a really nice touch.<br /><br />Secondly, the instructions are simple, but effective. They start by telling you to hook everything up and make sure it works, and THEN to install them on the bike. Again, this might not seem like much, but if one of the strips was dead, you know before you tear into your bike and find out after you get everything attached.<br /><br />The install was easy, there's plenty of connectors and wire to make it fit probably any bike. The most difficult part is figuring out where you want to put them. They are super bright, and the main remote has a brightness setting so you can make it a dim glow if you only want to light up the bike and not the road. There's plenty of settings and options to get just the right look that you're going for.<br /><br />Overall I'm highly pleased with this kit, and I'll definitely tell anyone who asks where I got it and recommend it to anyone looking to light up their bike.
B00HVI8R1S|5|Exactly what I wanted.
B001449I5E|5|Worked great on my wife's 2011 Chevy Traverse. Total install including the hitch was 45 minutes. I will say that this is &#34;just barely&#34; the right length for the 2011 Traverse. I pushed up the wiring harness behind the bumper trim for a cleaner install look and to keep the wires hidden and out of the elements and it was barely long enough. 1/4 inch shorter and I wouldn't have been able to install it that way. But it worked and I love it. You can install by zip-tying the wires up to the hitch with much more ease but I preferred to install as mentioned above.
B0000VM18I|5|Works better than all the others I tried. Keeps killing so the nest can't be rebuilt.
B000Q0PENM|5|exactly as described. A+
B00KHUQ6L0|1|It said it would fit my Honda Ridgeline, but it wasn't close.  Waste of money for me
B00CHD49E6|5|Got Here way sooner than expected and fit perfect. Thanks ya'll
B00P4XSMC6|3|Had to trim to make fit
B0033TLR5W|4|Just wasn't very shiny.
B0062OSEP6|5|so far so good and met my expectation
B0041CFUN0|5|Perfect! Auuuh!
B004XJL0IA|5|Great product had no issues with the appellation process fit in perfect as expect and seal great no worries on leaking oil and love the fact it felxable
B00CKING1K|5|It worked fine
B0002KKIVE|4|Haven't had time to really test product, but so far with one application, it has performed well. Do follow directions and google for tips..
B00EI6EEJK|5|Excellent, just Excellent, recomended....
B005UQQ74C|4|Shipped fast and well. Product as described. Good deal for the price. Easy to roll up if need to get to area underneath. Was easy to cut and fit to trunk. Works in a Prius.
B00H9S71LW|3|Works great overall, no disconnecting issues. But mine does not appear to goto sleep ever. Both bluetooth and the green light stay on indefinitely.
B00ELHT3PG|5|I have a 2010 Chevy suburban and it use to consume every bit of a quart every 3500 miles.  After using HPS 5-30 in it for two oil changes every 5000 miles, it no longer uses any oil. A+++
B0017TTPE0|5|Works great!
B000EDOSKG|2|Slips off the faucet.
B0014BHVZ6|5|Wix makes a great oil filter.  They receive high marks from every source that I have reviewed.
B00U3ZBTOI|4|Works good as a phone backup, some cases you have to hit the reset button to get it to provide a boost voltage
B0067ERAFG|3|Installed on a still stock Kaw. 2012 1700 c.c. Nomad. Really woke my bike up! Better throttle response. a little more get up & go. MPG has improved from around 44mpg. @ 65 mph. to 52+ @ 65 mph. But now I have Pipes & an air kit on the way. I have learned Dyno tuning can be pricey when you can find a tuning center that isn't H.D. only. On a biker Fourm I'm learning that the Dynojet Auto-tune kit for the PCV has it limits & you need to be good with a P.C. I'm not. I'm already thinking of replacing the PCV with the Corba Power Pro. If you leave your bike stock or just add pipes this is a great product. But add an air kit and it can be 300.00+ for tuning. When you tune a PCV it is set for where you are at that time. I like to travel & can change elevation quite a bit.
B001TI1F5Q|5|Great product. It has a nice smell , it dries right way and leaves a nice satin finish.
B00LBACAMY|5|You NEED this product if you leave your top down the majority of the time like myself, especially if you live in a constantly sunny climate. Great for reducing sun and wind, and makes the Jeep a little cooler inside on hot days which is always appreciated. Easy to install despite lack of directions - the product is pretty self-explanatory. The only con to this product is the Jeep feels slightly less open with it on, but to no longer have to worry about sunburn, I can live with it.
B001PR2K2S|5|Working well.
B00TO63CP6|5|necesito información
B000CINVA6|5|I bought this because I had heard that white lithium grease was the product to use on noisy garage doors.  My garage door was only a month old,  but started to  groan so horribly & loudly I had to cover my ears while it was opening. I squirted this stuff liberally on the moving parts,  especially the spring at the top, and it didn't drip at all. I then ran the door up and down several times,  & the noise was much reduced. I think it took a day or two to really work its way in,  because it got even better as time went by. It's now over two months later,  and the door is still operating quietly.
B000UOFBQO|5|A lot better than paying a dealer to install a pricey OEM relay.
B00PV5CN22|1|Too thin for our use.  They would not stay in place and everytime your feet touched them, they would slide all over the place.<br />Found what we wanted at Walmarts.
B00EVQHYOE|5|I am very impressed with quality of these horns. They are loud enough to be heard on I-95 where I drive every day!
B00X1WEHSA|4|I tought that were black, but it's ok
B00Y3H39VS|2|Had to drill holes into it and place screws and nuts in because it would not hold in place, the poles kept on sliding down.
B00B4XD51I|4|very good
B00MNMVOP8|5|Love this plate covers
B00INRVCEA|5|extra parts i needed.
B00684THQA|1|It didn't work for my 2006 Nissan Murano 😪
B00V2XHMBY|1|Thing is crap<br />Burned the spot light bulbs with in the 1st week<br />Still havent heard back from the seller either<br />I think I waisted my money
B00JDHQKEQ|5|Great product exactly as advertised
B00ZOKJVAG|5|Bought car window sun shade to protect my double yellow head Amazon parrot from the sun as we drive around town. It works perfectly. Criquette my parrot appreciates the shade on hot sunny days.
B00Z2RCCE8|1|Should have listened to all the other reviews. Would not even power up. Sending it back
B0008FUH46|2|Not as safe as the master lock, but ok
B00Y5N2PL0|3|Said it would fit my 1990 katana didn't really but with a little bit of modifying I made it work
B008PJQEHG|5|works perfect for my GPS easy install A+
B0044ALTKM|5|perfect made
B005NLQAHS|4|Good job at doing what its supposed to do....clear check engine lights.  Just don't install the software it comes with on your computer.  It's full of spyware.
B000E8T83S|5|have used this filter in my 2004 Dodge Dakota since new, along with using Mobil 1 oil , very satisfied with both products, also use it in the wife's Honda Accord
B008DUUA7C|5|exactly what I needed
B002OAQD9Q|5|The other reviews were correct in saying you need to paint this before installing or rust will be a guarantee. I suggest buying this compared to purchasing angle iron at Home Depot. It is 1/8&#34; thick steel with 10 holes to attach the guard to. You need to drill holes were it will attach to your coach. I drilled 8 - 25/64&#34; holes and used S.S. 3/8&#34; bolts, washers and nylon lock nuts. When it is time to paint this, there is only 1 product you should use. It's called POR 15. Google it. This is the ONLY paint I will ever use to prevent, stop or repair any item prone to rust. Enough said, google it, if you never want to deal with rust issues.
B00R3LYF7S|5|love this trunk organizer fits nice in the back of my van and still leaves room for a full size stroller. the sturdy handles make it convenient for unloading the trunk. made from sturdy cloth material and removable drop in bottoms makes this trunk organizer foldable for storage
B002ES21EE|4|Well made with fast delivery.
B00KC5D2US|5|Perfect fit, direct replacement part, all clips included, except for the hose clamp. Old clamp was not reusable, so purchased a clamp separately. No issues at all with this part. Really great and super convenient to find it right here on Amazon. Highly recommend!
B004J76HBG|5|looks good very happy
B00P9QKPEG|5|Good fit
B00CVVUQ50|4|Good value for the price :)
B008RAFJ38|5|Amazing product!! Got to buy! No mess and quickest way to install differential gear or oil change without having to wait 24 hrs for the standard RTV gasket maker to dry!
B000JLNBW4|5|Fits perfectly on my desk at work. I've only used the cooling function.  It cools down quickly and just big enough to hold the lunch items I want to keep cold.
B001QQD9PK|5|Very easy to apply when following the included instructions. The end result is exactly what I was looking for! Niiiice.........<br /><br />Doug A.
B000CLMC2G|3|Careful when ordering this item for a 2003 Civic.  The bleed screw as shown in the picture is accurate, and is quite a bit longer than the Honda original.  While it is workable, you won't be able to get a fully enclosed 8 mm bleed wrench (or even a flange wrench) over it, you'll have to use a standard 8 mm open end wrench.  Fine for when it is new, but could be a real problem way down the road when things corrode.  Also, the manufacturer apparently reversed the part number for my particular shipment (the '75 was actually the right side, and the '76 was the left side instead of the other way around).  Not a problem because I ordered both.<br /><br />Otherwise, fits and works.
B00E1SPD2M|4|Nice brakes work really well
B006N9FLLU|5|WORKED LIKE A CHARM FOR MY 2002 EXPLORER
B00070FJL8|5|The frame was great, but it covered up the year decal and I ordered a Slim one
B002T4SEZI|5|Well designed to fit onto the Mule. Attaches to the square steel support bar in the back of the Mule with U-clamps and to the welded muffler support struts with bolts. My only complaint is that the attachment to the muffler supports uses metric bolts and nuts (because Kawasaki uses metric and has welded nuts as part of the muffler strut which the bolt must pass through), but then English nuts for the U-clamps, and the different nuts are ALMOST but not exactly the same size so that you must carefully figure out which nuts go where before assembling, so as not to strip the nuts using them on the wrong threads. It would have been easy for Fuse Powersports to include metric U-clamps which used the same nuts and entirely avoid this problem. BUT, if you correctly figure out which nuts to use where, it installs easily and you're ready to pull your wood-splitter to the logs and start loading the mule with firewood.
B001K9JO5C|5|Same design as the other three on my 2002 Beetle
B000JZNXNM|2|Despite Amazon's &#34;Check Fit&#34; feature saying it fits, it does NOT fit a 2003 Civic Hybrid.  Way too small.  In fact, it fits INSIDE the existing drum (see third picture).  Quality seems OK but won't work for me.
B00FSCK9HY|5|I have been wearing this jacket daily from late winter of 2014 to the summer of 2015. The jacket has lots of features which makes it very versatile for all conditions, including:<br /><br />The jacket alone with 6 zippered vents open during hot weather (closed for chilly summer mornings)<br />A waterproof liner for rainy days<br />An insulated liner for colder days.<br />Both liners together for extra wind protection.<br /><br />Sizing:<br />I wear a large shirt and 42R suit, I am 6'1&#34; and 200lbs. I ordered the 3XL based on other reviews, but it is a tad loose. This is not a problem for me because I like to wear a hoodie under my jackets in the winter and the fit is perfect for that. I like the jacket so much that I have considered getting another jacket one size down for summer use (a tighter fit would help keep the armor in place during a fall).<br /><br />Protection:<br />I hit a patch of sand & gravel around a sharp curve at about 30mph and my dual sport bike went down. I hit the oiled road pretty hard, but this jacket (plus my other armored clothing) performed perfectly. I could not tell which part of my body hit first because nothing hurt and no clothing was torn. Good jacket! I am considering upgrading the armor, since most jackets like these come with the cheaper stuff.
B00IKZTRLA|5|loving it gets me all kinds of dbl takes
B00BJEICDS|5|We are using this tow light as I am writing this.  We have been on the road for a month and had to change the batteries only once so far.  It works great and I highly recommend it.
B00HCSBQ7Y|5|Best Bang for your buck. Easy to install and work great.
B000FOIJXQ|1|This initially looked great, then spots started to peel. I bought two more to do more plastic trim and touch up what peeled on my bumpers. The instructions tell you not to put it on paint, etc. So I used masking tape to tape off the paint. I applied the product per instructions. Waited 30 minutes, it says it dries in 15-20 minutes. I peeled off the masking tape, and so the rest of the &#34;dye&#34; peeled with it. This is basically brush on Plasti-dip, not dye. Dye does not peel off. What a waste of money.
B000COOBM2|1|Bought 4 of these October 2014 for my 2006 Dodge Ram Mega Cab 2500 5.9L 4x4. I put these on at 50k miles seeking to improve the ride and reduce side to side sway. It did not work. Very soft shocks. Worse than the Stock shock I took off. Would not recommend these to anyone. Not to mention Monroe did not send me the rebate 4 for price of 3 after sending in all the required documentation.  Im getting these off and  spend the money and get the Bilstein shocks.
B000C17G5E|5|Great part  at great price half the price of local parts store I've put 6000 miles on it sinse install with no issues with these and all intakes or plenums tork to factory spec very important
B0055DSVW6|5|Just what I ordered and needed
B002DOME1E|4|They work great-- but not necesarily for very long unless you're more careful than I was. One broke the first time I used it. I was using them to keep my bike tires and pedals from spinning while it was on my bike rack. That worked very well, and was a lot easier to use than the bungies (no accidental snapping/metal hooks flying at my fingers). When I took the bike off the rack and undid all the loops, I missed one. I spun the pedals, pushed on them when they got &#34;stuck&#34; and instead of the velcro coming undone, the plastic loop just snapped off. In the products' defense, you wouldn't want the velcro to come undone under pressure, but I also wouldn't want the loops to snap and leave my tires spinning.<br /><br />My summary: use them carefully, so that any one individual strap isn't holding too much tension, and they'll serve you well.
B00QJDL5U6|3|Shipped fast and well. Product as described. Does not fit my Prius well, even though suggested on Amazon as it would. It is nice that it isn't toxic, however it looks a cheap.
B00OQPRPK8|5|This car organizer is great.  It's just what I needed.  I'm an Uber driver and I use it to hold complimentary waters, gum, mints, etc.  The riders love it.  Thanks for the great product.
B0048YEJ0G|4|These are ok. I like them but i would prefer<br />something else to these. For the price they did<br />what they are meant to do. Just didnt seem like they fit my<br />face very well.
B00ADIHUVG|5|Bought this as a quick connect for motorcycle battery powered compressor. Works great. Keep some extra fuses.
B000CN5G7W|5|product was great and fit perfectly, must use this with one spring if your going to use the bilstein 5100 adjustable and oem 886 spring, you will not be to use tundra isolator you have use the tacoma isolators.
B000CPAW2E|5|Appears to be of good quality, and was a perfect fit for my new 2015 White Yaris SE.<br /><br />Like any other part of your vehicle, it needs to be polished/protected appropriately to maintain its appearance - especially if you live in an area with lots of road salt, etc.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/12/2017 - Holding up great to the hot Arizona climate and still looks new.
B00NRVCOZS|5|Great deal. Mounted on my Honda NT700V and lights up the night.
B00ON29N7C|5|Product was an exact replacement, Like the fact that it came in both white and black.
B004BTBUXC|4|Fits decently. You can neatly trim it if it doesn't quite fit.
B007M5QH6C|5|I thought the product was absolutely excellent. I had it installed in less than five minutes. It is working like a charm and I couldn't be happier.
B000C9D8NA|1|I replaced the whole ac system (compressor,orfic,accumalator,condensor,lines, and had the evaporater flushed. 5 months later after all the time and money the clutch came apart on this brand new compressor. very disappointed
B0024ECHII|4|good product
B00DWVN08I|5|Like it very much!
B00RW3PBAC|5|Great price for a 2 pack of mirrors... as good as oem even come with oem style connectors for an easy plug and plug install.
B000IROTCA|5|works great
B00873J0YY|4|First of all, these are a good value.  I am pleased for what I paid for these J-bar racks.  But, I am going to give them four starts for three reasons; assembly is miserable, and they are not easy on easy off.  They could use different hardware and make them easier to put on.  The third reason is that they really should come with some kind of padding so that the metal brackets do not tear up your cross bars.<br /><br />Assembly:  These were not impossible to assemble, but they were a pain in the butt.  I couldn't figure out whether it was better to put the plastic pads on the larger piece and then add the smaller or vice versa.  Both were miserable.  But, I managed to get them together, smacking them around a bit and taking my time.  Also, I was missing four washers with my set, which isn't the end of the world.<br /><br />Installation:  These installed well on the Whispbar crossbars I put on my 2013 Highlander.  I didn't want to ruin the metal on my cross bars with these steel plates, so I cut up an old yoga mat into four strips that were the width of the bracket and wrapped all the way around the top and bottom of the bars.  That helped a lot.  It is a tight fit between the roof of the car and the bolts to tighten these on, so I also had to put a piece of yoga mat on the roof so that I didn't scratch up my paint.  I ended up alternating between 13mm regular and long sockets depending on how far the nut was threaded on the bolts.  I didn't use the provided hand-crank nuts, as I thought I would get them much tighter with regular bolts.  The directions call for both, but I don't see the point.  With the regular bolts cranked down I didn't need the hand nuts.  Once these were installed they were tight and didn't move around with either of the kayaks.  We have a 50-ish lb and a 60-ish lb kayak and both were fine.  The provided straps did a good job securing the kayaks to the rack.  If I were going to go on an interstate trip with the kayaks, I'd probably use a heavier duty strap instead of the ones provided.  For local use around town, however, the provided straps seem fine to me.  If you're struggling to figure out how to strap them on, I ran the strap down the left side (as you face it) of the rack on the back side of the kayak and down the right side on the front of the kayak, crossing it right between the bolts on the bottom of the rack itself.  That allowed it to really hold fast to the rack.<br /><br />Concern about durability:  The foam padding on the rack itself does not seem like it will hold up over the long term.  One of the pieces is already pretty mangled from the friction of getting one of the kayaks on and adjusted to the right position.  I hosed my down after use since the kayaks had been in brackish water. We'll see how the finish holds up over time.<br /><br />If these were easier on/off the car, I'd probably give them five stars.  I have an Inno rack for our paddleboards which is a quick on/off and also secure.  It also cost more!  For the price, these are decent, basic racks.  If we start using the kayaks all the time I may upgrade to a different manufacturer.  For now, I'm pleased with this purchase.duty strap instead of the ones provided.

B00YML13OU|5|Bought this product for me as I'm a student driver at the moment, highly recommended, came in 5 days through Standard Shipping, product came as described.
B00BG1HG5Y|4|nice lanyard.  i just wish it was all one piece. definitely like it though
B010H0QV7S|5|WOW Digital Tire Pressure multi-tool; a white LED, a red LED, a tire gauge, a seat belt cutter, and an emergency glass hammer.<br />The two LED lights. The white light is a bright but will really only help you see within your direct line of vision. Red light is great for signalling, working without loosing your night vision. I really like the red light in particular. The seat belt cutter has a very sharp blade; it's protected by a sturdy piece of plastic so there is no chance of accidentally cutting yourself. (Which is awesome for the klutz like myself)<br />The back-light on the gauge makes it easier to read. The readout is big enough read even without my glasses on. The gauge reads in bars, KPA, PSI, KGCM; so whatever scale of measure you use this will work for you. With accuracy to +/- 1 PSI. The back light goes out in 20 seconds and the read out goes out in 90 seconds which is a great perk.<br />The emergency glass hammer is my favorite perk. First you have to move a switch to open and close the hammer. The hammer is a bullet shaped heavy metal with a sharp point. I really love how it tucks away in the handle.<br />The entire device fits comfortably in The Husbands hand and mine as well. Nothing is crowded or hard to use.<br />The DBPower uses 2 x AAA batteries which are not included.<br />This is a wonderful took to keep in your center console for emergencies.<br />I have received a free or greatly discounted product for the purpose of this review. The opinions are 100% mine.
B00026Z3F4|5|just what I wanted best jack I have found  don't buy a speedy lift they don't last
B0000CBJE7|1|I used the Velcro patch to stick it to my car dashboard.  I got into the car one day after sitting in the sun and because it got so hot in the car the adhesive on the Velcro patch failed and the clock had fallen to the floor.
B006Z907TY|4|A good product for large travelers. We had no problems taking them through security or on the plane.
B00VHQF0TC|5|I have a Coverking Custom Sunshade for my Full size Bronco everyday driver.  It's such a pain to put on and off that I only use when parked all day long.  This one is easy to put up and down when doing my daily driving.  It is actually too small but covers the majority of the windshield.  It hides besides my seat without taking up space in my backseat too.
B00QU6YOEQ|3|This lamp looks very nice over our motorhome's sink. Even better after I replaced the included incandescent bulbs with two of these SMD wedge based &#34;bulbs&#34;:  'GRV T10 921 194 13-5050 SMD Wedge LED Bulb lamp Super Bright Warm White DC 12V Pack of 10'. The three star rating is because the light covers are a pain to remove, either by design or poor manufacturing quality. That said, the LED bulbs last a long time!
B0036ULWW6|5|Awesome
