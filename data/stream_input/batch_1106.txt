0765322889|5.0|4 1/2 Stars    It took me quite a while to get used to the author's prose. There's no easy introduction to the world Erikson and Esslemont created, instead your plunk head first into the middle of the story. I was used to authors like Robert Jordan, Robin Hobbs, Stephen Donaldson's, Tad Williams, David Gemmell's etc. I must admit that the first time I tried to enter the series, after a few pages only in Gardens of the Moon I dropped the book in frustration, I expected better due to the praises I've read about the series.     Then one afternoon, looking for something to read, I gave the book another chance. With expectations lowered considerably, I just let the author tell me his story, things I didn't understand I just left alone, to be mulled out for later. Before halfway into the book, I began to enjoy the book immensely. Thanks mostly to the improved prose, fast paced actions and the interesting characters Erikson introduced.     The characters aren't as fleshed out as they should have been if they've been written by an another kind of author like Martin. No paper was wasted in giving them long back stories. Instead, we get to know them by their actions, how others see them, by their eccentricities. The show not tell writing style was put to great use here. I surmise that the author had dispensed with the traditional way of storytelling was because what he wants to tell couldn't fit into the book if he used that. This is not a book that is wanting for plots and ideas. On reread, this book became another sort of book entirely, a lot of things I missed the first time around, was made completely clear to me, a sense of the author's skill in foreshadowing made me appreciate this book more.     One thing is certain, if you like this book. You will love the rest.
B004CEUEWE|4.0|Rarely do I like action movies.  But this one has brains behind it.  Way to go Ben Affleck.  This movie is cleverly scaffolded in suspense.  Not so much suspense that your brain hurts after seeing it.  Not too little where you know what's going to happen next.  Just right on.  The only thing I didn't like about this movie was the title.  It deserves a better one than \\"Town\\".  I'd watch this movie again.  Good job!
0061726826|5.0|Holy heart palpitations batman! Delirium by Lauren Oliver was pure insanity. Please forgive me for this gush-fest, but oh my goodness Delirium swept me off my feet.<br /><br />I am not going to talk about the characters in great detail, because while they were amazing, they are not what kept me flipping pages like a crazy person. Lena is a teenage girl who has always played by the rules. She has always lived in fear of standing out - all she has ever wanted is to be normal. She is terrified of falling in love and wants nothing more than to be \\"cured\\".<br /><br />Lena expresses her feeling on the subject within the first few pages of the book and this is what initially [...] in. The idea of a teenage girl being desperately afraid of falling in love was so intriguing to me. I can never remember a time that I did not want to fall in love. It's something all girls dream about - everyone wants to love and be loved.<br /><br />The loveless world that Oliver creates is both fascinating and terrifying at the same time.  Those who are cured never show any genuine affection and everyone acts like a Stepford wife.  The adults do not even have hobbies they love - Lena is warned that she may not feel the urge to run anymore, something that she has always found comfort it. It is really a chilling concept and you cannot help but feel desperate for Lena to somehow escape.<br /><br />Like I said before, Lena has always feared deliria, but somehow it sneaks up on her. When Lena meets Alex, she initially avoids him at all costs. She has never been a loud to interact with boys; everyone is segregated until they are \\"cured\\".  Eventually she gives in and is opened up to a whole other world. She begins to see what the world has to offer and she is left questioning her entire existence.<br /><br />While the plot and the characters were all beautifully written, what really makes this book standout is the emotional reaction it evokes.  I was literally on an emotional roller-coaster as I followed Lena's progression throughout the story. I particularly enjoyed watching her reactions as she was introduced to real music - the kind that settles deep inside your bones. You have no choice but to feel emotionally invested in the outcome. Lena goes through a number of highs and lows and I was right there with her the entire time. I felt the joyful excitement of first love and the bitter hollowness of disappointment, grief and loss. I swear to you, I am pretty sure I had a few minor heart attacks while reading this one.<br /><br />Honestly, there is nothing I can say that is going to do this book justice. You simply have to see, read and feel it for yourself. I can tell you this; I am already aching for the next book in the series. I nearly cried when I realized I had finished the last page and now had to wait to see what happens next.tory.

0525423273|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss is nothing short of amazing. Honestly, I was a little afraid to read it because nearly  everyone has loved it. I am not usually one for the sugary sweet teen romance books and I was afraid that's what Anna would be.<br /><br />While there were definitely those cutesy moments, they were never unrealistic. A lot of teen rom-com books place so much stock in the \\"romance\\" portion of the book that the characters suffer. What I loved about this book is that the characters stood for themselves. Anna is incredibly well-rounded and extremely easy to relate to. I saw so much of myself in her character and I think a lot of girls will see themselves in her too. She is in a word - real. Anna is insecure and overwhelmed by the sprawling city of Paris. She doesn't speak French, so she refuses to order anything complicated at meal time. She is intimidated by her classmates and she feels like she doesn't belong. She also has so many quirky little traits that really bring her to life. She wants to be a film critic and has a huge passion for old movies. She is a little goofy and is an extremely caring person. which is what really gets her into trouble.<br /><br />Almost immediately after Anna arrives in Paris she falls for one of her new friends, St. Clair. I mean, who wouldn't? Perkins went all out with this heartthrob. Our heroine never stood a chance. He's devastatingly handsome and excruciatingly charming. Oh and did I mention he has a British accent?  He's also quirky and caring and extremely down-to-earth. I just have one question... where can I find one?<br /><br />Anyways, unfortunately for Anna, St. Clair is taken. Because she is a good Southern girl, Anna decides the best plan of action is to hide her feelings for him. As the book and their friendship progress , Anna does a lot of maturing. I love when we see characters grow up throughout the story and Anna really comes into her own. She isn't perfect by any means - she makes plenty of mistakes along the way. But that's what makes her so relatable, you cannot help but cheer her on as the story unfolds.<br /><br />The plot line reminded me a lot of those old romantic comedies where the characters are always misunderstanding one another. I am assuming this was done on purpose, since Anna is obsessed with those old movies.  Much like the romantic comedies, it's almost painful for the reader because it is obvious how perfect Anna and St. Clair are for one another.<br /><br />Like I said before, there are a number of \\"cutesy\\" moments peppered throughout the novel. Please don't be put off by this, because they are done so well. Perkins has such a talent for understated charm - all of the Anna/ St. Clair moments are almost downplayed. It's not a book full of hot make out scenes  and tons of heat; it takes much more of a realistic approach. Because of this the reader is able to see how well the characters actually mesh together. Their relationship is an actual relationship - they have discussions, they tease one another and they take care of one another.<br /><br />Anna and the French Kiss was a remarkable debut. Perkins' set the bar so high with this one - I can only hope that her next book is half as good. Anna's story is honest, heartwarming and endearing.  She is easy to relate to and St. Clair is the perfect match for her. if you haven't read this book yet, you NEED to. No excuses , go find a copy right now.

B001E5FYS8|5.0|This is a great film.  For one, it's an interesting time capsule of how things used to be.  Sneaking into the World Trade Center?  Would never happen today like it did back then.    Then there is the aspect of the man the film was about.  The guy had a defining purpose and did whatever it took to make it happen.  Really an amazing story of how, when a person really wants to go something, they'll fight against all odds to see that it becomes a reality and risk life and limp in the process.

It has been a great help so far and as we get further into our project it will become a more valuable resource

B000KX0IOA|5.0|When one talks about the Civil Rights Movement, many would reference Martin Luther King and the fight for Black Americans' civil rights.  In Gandhi, we are given a historical visual of India's Civil Right Movement lead by Mohanda Gandhi against the British rule of India.  There are a lot of similarities between the Martin Luther and Gandhi fights for Civil Rights.  The opening scene is the assassination of Ghandi in 1948.  You are then taken to the beginning, when young Gandhi is questioned why he is seating in first class compartment on the train. Evening after showing his ticket and explaining he is a London educated lawyer, he is thrown from the train in South Africa.  It is here he began his non-violent protest against the South African government.  Even though he experienced firsthand the bias laws, beatings and jail, he persevered.  This perseverance leads unwanted attention for the South African government, and cause them to give into his demands.     After returning to India and seeing the poverty and the injustices that Indians were subjected to under British rule, he is sought out to lead a non-violent fight for Indians in his beloved India.  This time it was more challenging because of the British refusal and the massive amount of people he had to reach and convince to be non-violent in their actions.  Gandhi, was about to stop his fight when over 1,000 men, women and children were massacre at a meeting calling for non-violence.  Violent acts of retaliation broke out and Gandhi fast until peace was restored.     This movie is a great educational tool it shows how imperialism of another cultural ruling another; it speaks to the Hindu religion and how it respects others religion.  The movie shows how Islam and Hinduism co-existed.  There is the scene where Gandhi is fasting and a Hindu man demands him to eat, he admits to killing a Muslim child because they killed his and he was going to hell.  Gandhi tells him he change that by finding a Muslim child who parents are dead and raise him as his son and raise him as Muslim. Throughout the movie the Hindu belief of turning away from worldly possessions and passions, and turning to mediation and prayer to achieve the ultimate goal a union with the Absolute Reality is shown.  This movie also answers why there is conflict between Pakistan and India.

006176759X|2.0|...that this book should have been reconsidered before being published. I am a teacher and I read approximately 5-10 young adult books each week. This particular book led me to write a review; and unfortunately a negative review. Sadly, this book was unoriginal, had a poor story line, and moreover, an extremely flaky ending. I would literally be able to give a synopsis of the whole book in one paragraph and the reader would miss nothing. There are too many details irrelevant to the reader, and at other times in the book, details are completely omitted and forgotten (why was the relationship so complicated between Willow and Braden anyway?). I'm far from a prude but even this book seemed promotional towards underage drinking, casual and frequent uncommitted sex, as well as irresponsible spending and money management. I'm surprised and saddened that Harper even considered this book in their usually good repertoire of publicly offered young adult novels.
B002JVWR0Y|5.0|After being utterly stunned by the brilliance that was Dexter, Season One, I was sorely dissapointed by season two and three.  (They were good, just not up to the standards set by the first).  That's why I didn't rush out to buy season 4 as soon as it was released.      But eventually, I had some spare cash and some free time to give it a go.  So I picked up a copy and my husband and I settled down this past weekend to give it a go.    All I can say is that it was fantastic!  I loved every minute of it, and the ending was utterly stunning and I was at the edge of my seat throughout the whole thing.  Definitely restored my faith in Dexter---it's just a shame I heard season 5 is a letdown.    This one definitely deserves five stars.  There is not a negative thing I can think to say about it.  If you felt letdown by seasons one or two, or even if you've enjoyed every season of Dexter equally as much, you'll definitely not be dissapointed by this one.

0307474712|5.0|I picked up this book at an airport in London, hoping I would have something to read sporadically during my week long holiday in Tenerife. Lets just say I ended up needing to by another book a couple days later because I finished this one so quickly! I stayed up until 3 am two nights in a row because I couldn't put it down. I loved the two main characters of the book, and being able to watch them grow and change. It was really nice to not have that feeling at the end of a book like \\"So then what happened?\\" With 'One Day', you are able to see their whole lives pan out, not just one chapter of it (pun not intended). Wonderful read!

B003INBOEM|4.0|This movie was outstanding; I can't believe I hadn't seen Donnie Yen before.  There are a lot of negative comments regarding subtitles and dubbing--I would like to point out that on the BluRay version, there are options for Mandarin, Cantonese, and English (and maybe more, I can't remember), with subtitles.  The quality is great--I believe the film becomes intentionally more monochromatic and grainy after the Japanese invasion.  Understanding that this is a movie about a grandmaster, we expect embellishment with the fight scenes (things like people defying gravity and such), but it is kept to a minimum.  Overall, an outstanding film.  I would like to see Wing Chun in more movies rather than only the typical Northern styles.
B002ZG980U|1.0|Leo DiCaprio is such a darling to critics. Anything he is in seems to get better than average reviews. Even Leo can't save this mess!<br /><br />Something happens, followed by 10 minutes of dialogue. Something else happens, followed by 20 minutes of dialogue. Repeat that senerio over and over again throughout the movie.<br /><br />Also, there are plenty of characters introduced throughout all the dialogue. It's a chore to keep track of all these characters and what they are even doing there, or why they appeared to begin with.<br /><br />Talk about plot holes! There are plot holes within' plot holes within' more plot holes.<br /><br />I gave this 1.5 hours and turned in off. At that point, I could have cared less what happened. I still don't.<br /><br />Thank you for reading. I may be right and I may be wrong. Never trust a critic for sure! Until then....

0061537969|4.0|This book was actually pretty popular with my book club, family, and friends. Both males and females seem to really like it. I agree with some of the reviews about how it seems like it may be overly tragic. However, I found it to be well paced, even if not terribly realistic at times. While the voice and tone may be trite at points, one has to consider the narrator. And, really, the book does offer some inspirational insight. Sometimes life is about perspective- and I think that's what this book is ultimately about: a perspective on the human condition. That which you manifest before you. Something about that just appeals to me.
B0006J28KU|5.0|How does a 72-year-old lady who usually is reading Angela Thirkell novels decide to watch \\"HEAT\\"?  Because I googled Ted Levine who is great on old \\"Monk\\" episodes and discovered he'd been in this movie.  So I got it from the local library and after 2 watchings, commentary and all, decided it was the best movie ever made.<br /><br />I especially enjoy Michael Mann's commentary.  I'd always thought a film study class would be interesting and these commentaries make a pretty good substitute.<br /><br />So, tired of waiting for the library copy, I bought my personal copy from Amazon.<br /><br />Getting Pacino and DeNiro in one movie is a plus.  After all, they aren't that much younger than me.  Ha!

Jillian is a great motivator during the workouts too!
B0036EH3TS|4.0|The summer of 1998 was mostly unremarkable, with the majority of films failing to impress. The overblown Godzilla was a humongous letdown, as was Armageddon's rival Deep Impact. Armageddon came out champ of the summer season (along with Saving Private Ryan, Lethal Weapon 4, and There's Something About Mary). But none of these films managed to push past $217 million, which would be absolutely unthinkable now, inflation or not.<br /><br />Despite the relatively low box office returns (just a smidgen over $200 million), the marketing machine for Armageddon was in our faces everywhere, and I feared it might burn-out audiences before release. I know I felt a little cynical when I went into the cinema that day, my expectations very low.<br /><br />I've said before that Michael Bay does himself no favors. The man knows how to make a blockbuster, but he's utterly clueless when it comes to making a good film. Armageddon is the only film in his entire resume that I find watchable and entertaining, though he still should have held back some scenes (the notorious animal cracker love scene really should have been dropped).<br /><br />A big boulder of iron ferite hurtles through space, knocking smaller meteors toward Earth (thinking of breaking a frame on a pool table). NASA recruits immature oil driller Harry Tasker and his band of roughnecks to go into space and nuke the comet before it ends all life our little blue planet. With an 18-day countdown it's going to be very, very close.<br /><br />Although it took a total of 18 writers to staple the screenplay together, Armageddon succeeds in almost every area where Deep Impact failed, plus more. The soap opera is kept to a minimum while the action is ramped up, delivering one hair's-breadth escape after another, all to the sound of Trevor Rabin's amazing score, which the life blood of the movie. The huge cast of fine actors, the SFX, and the action would all be significantly inferior without Rabin's soaring tunes, which turn many of the key scenes into wordless music videos of visual storytelling.<br /><br />That's not to say that the acting isn't notable. As a matter of fact, Bruce Willis is surprisingly effective, as is Will Patton, who rarely gets a decent role in mainstream movies. Though, as with Con Air a year before, Steve Buscemi owns every scene he's in (tying with Peter Stormare). Just ignore the horribly miscast Ben Affleck whenever he appears. He's the only real weak link of the movie, to the point where you ought to switch off during his screen-time.<br /><br />As the only truly exciting blockbuster of the 1998 summer season, Armageddon defines a lackluster year, and elevates Michael Bay's classless resume.

B003V5PPZG|4.0|First of all, this was an amazing album and I really enjoyed it.  My favorite tracks being Iridescence and Blackout.  I bought the original censored one first and then saw this and had to get it for the DVD.  But the DVD was very short and I didn't like how it was edited.  I wouldn't say don't get it because it's still a DVD.  And this version is uncensored so that's also good.
B003QCCS36|5.0|I've seen Ray LaMontagne in concert twice, and each experience was just amazing. This album is probably better than his previous 'masterpiece' \\"Gossip In The Grain\\" -- It brings his signature singer-songwriting to a new level in a band setting with 'The Pariah Dogs'. I'm glad to hear 'Beg, Steal or Borrow' on Adult Rock stations like KFOG in SF and KPRI in San Diego, but I ask these stations to play more tracks from this album. It's worthy of the Grammy they earned tonight. If you don't have this album, why are you waiting \\"GET IT\\".  Peace - JG 'Bear'
B001UV4XFQ|3.0|I bought this blu-ray/DVD combo because it was such a great price and I really wanted a \\"2-disc\\" set with all the special features.  This is only ONE disc (Blu-ray movie on one side, DVD version on the other), but is does have all the special features, which is great.  The Blu-ray is great ... nice picture, clear and crisp (I'm really not all that picky when it comes to Blu-ray vs. DVD -- as long as I can follow the story, I'm happy!)  The special features were fun to watch also.  I always enjoy the behind-the-scenes stuff, and this was worth it.      As far as the \\"Eclipse\\" story, well, they could have done better -- but that's been my complaint with all the Twilight movies. I loved the books and have been very disappointed with the movies.  In my opinion they should have chosen a better cast to begin with -- Kristen Stewart makes me crazy and I can't figure out why they decided that she can act. She did better this movie, but she's had several years to \\"practice\\" her role so it's about time she showed some improvement.  I was more impressed with Rob Pattinson this time and thought he did a much better job than in previous movies.  And most of the \\"wolves\\" were great.  The Cullens were good and did about as well as in the other movies.  My favorite actor so far in this series is \\"Charlie\\" -- I think Billy Burke has done a fabulous job.  Overall, it was okay, about what I have come to expect from the Twilight movies.  Good thing this Blu-ray/DVD was a good price, or I never would have bothered buying the movie.

Como é, minha mulher pode usá-lo. (Que tipo de material é esse, afinal? - Gossamer)    Mas uma vez que a T-shirt é removida ...    É aí que o problema com a embalagem vem no jogo.    A T-shirt é o que segurou o DVD e os extras na caixa, que é um cartão muito fina para começar. Tire a t-shirt e você tem um grande espaço na caixa. Quando você coloca o DVD de volta, eles guizo em torno da caixa.    Se você levá-los para fora da caixa, eles são embalados na sua própria manga pouco, mas o cartão da manga é muito fina, também. Se fosse um pesado estojo de papelão-like, que estaria tudo bem. Mas não é. Ele mal se levanta por si próprio. By the way, um item na manga é o 2-DVD. O outro item na manga detém os materiais de bónus. Mas, juntos, eles são apenas 1-1/4 \\"de profundidade. A caixa é 2\\" de profundidade. A T-shirt pegou os restantes 3 / 4 \\"para tornar a caixa cheia.    Então, ok, menos o T-shirt e apesar do papelão muito fina, o que nos resta? Quais são os materiais de bónus?    Novamente, não há grande coisa. Existem inúmeros postais (mais imagens são borradas e estranhamente cortada) e itens promocionais do filme, mais um par de outras peças de papelão colorido destinado a aparência bilhetes. Grande coisa. Interessante, talvez até esfriar. Mas vale mais US $ 10 - $ 20 sobre o preço dos 2 DVDs por si mesmo? Você é o juiz.    Então, ok, menos o T-Shirt, apesar do papelão muito fina, e para além da variedade de postais transitáveis e itens promocionais para o filme, que está na caixa?    Quando tudo estiver dito e feito, o que está realmente na caixa que me preocupa é o 2-DVDs remasterizados da The Song Remains the Same concerto (é um DVD do concerto, o DVD é outro material bônus) - que, passado vez que eu olhava, tinha apenas $ 13,99 na Amazon. Assim, ofilme Zep não só custa menos, mas o padrão de 2 DVDs remasterizados da The Song Remains the Same é uma caixa de DVD tradicional. Em outras palavras, é resistente. Ela vai estar na sua prateleira sem cair, ser esmagado, ou arrastados para cima. E para assisti-lo, você não tem que puxar para além de uma caixa, fumble ao redor do estojo, extraí-lo, e depois tentar recuperá-lo quando você estiver pronto - tudo sem prejudicar ainda mais o cartão. Soa como uma proposta perdedora para mim.    Em suma, embora a versão remasterizada The Song Remains the Same filme é excelente (eo conjunto de 2 CDs de áudio é impressionante!), A edição deste Collector's DVD conjunto é frágil, não ser bem pensado e surpreendentemente espetacular. Eu não recebi o \\"Uau!\\" fator quando eu abri a caixa. Eu tenho o \\"Gee? Agora o que eu faço com essas peças, agora que a T-shirt (que serviu como um espaçador na caixa) é removido?\\" fator.    Eu digo poupar o seu dinheiro no presente Collector's Edition DVD. Compre o DVD remasterizado 2-set de The Song Remains the Same vez. Você vai conseguir o que é realmente importante e você vai evitar a dor de cabeça tentando descobrir como armazenar cuidadosamente \\"bônus\\" itens sem danificá-los.

B0015DROBO|2.0|I began to read this book for my book club, and I wish someone had warned me about the explicit sexual content in the book.  I can't really say whether I would have enjoyed the story or not, as I only made it about 1/3 of the way through.  It wasn't like a cheap romance book, but it still made me uncomfortable enough to put it down.  I wanted to warn anyone else who is sensitive to that kind of thing.  By the way, I'm not Jason Baker; I'm his wife.  We just use one amazon account.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|Usually I do not care for most groups second albums. They seem to lack the effort of the first. Especially if their first was a fantastic grand debut, like Lady A's first. However, this album rocks! I love it just as much (and maybe even more) than their first. Keep 'em coming!
B001GCUER0|5.0|This is the best show out there...watch it!  Start with season one. Worth it. I have a girl crush on Joan!  Is that weird? LOL
B003W5C0VM|3.0|Rolling Stones playing their best songs. But the image is too dark, poor quality. This bluray is worthy just for fans.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I am in agreement with the majority of reviews rating this as a five-star item.  This was shot on film in 16mm HD.  Overall the transfer is outstanding evidently thanks to recent breakthroughs in technology that enabled it (according to the included special feature on the subject).  Film-like look with very tight grain and super color gamut with color accuracy and amazing image sharpness considering the source.  While there are a few digitization artifacts here and there (i.e. dithering in the crack of a slightly open door in the background of one shot and several isolated luminance variations in a few frames of some other shots), but this is really minor stuff in the 300 minutes of material.    I had recently read the novel that I had managed to avoid for 68+ years (since it came free of charge on my wife's Nook and I had time to kill).  Necessarily long for what it does so very well and a beautiful piece of writing providing a comprehensive and incisively detailed insight into gentrified 1810 English countryside life.  This BluRay transfer of these six 50-minute episodes is a virtual screenplay directly from the dialogue-rich novel.  I don't think anything of consequence was left out or truncated.  The novel is a masterpiece and this perfectly cast miniseries is its film equivalent.  You won't hear the complaint \\"I liked the novel better because they left so much out of the movie\\" about this production!
B002JVWR4U|5.0|I found the second season of Dollhouse to be much better than the first - there was much more depth to all of the characters and of course so many of the actors really shine (especially Eliza, Dichen, Fran, Enver, Tahmoh and Olivia). I especially love Alan Tudyk in this - it's worth watching for his amazing performance in both seasons, he tends to steal every scene he's in. Amy Acker, Summer Glau and Alexis Denisof are amazing as always - one of my favourite things about Joss is he treats all of these actors like family and they always seem to pop up in anything he's involved with (much to my delight!). Personally, I think there are too many law/cop/hospital dramas and not enough sci fi shows like this. As Joss says in the commentary on one disc, (to paraphrase) he felt the show was just too weird for network TV and it didn't work. Well, it doesn't work for the majority of people who like the same old boring shows about what they expect, but I wish more people would enjoy watching something different like this and appreciate the wild and crazy ride they take you on so that shows like this could stay on the air. Much like Firefly, which was gone far too soon, this one will be loved by fans for years to come - I hope they get to branch out with a movie one day. Joss' brother Jed and his wife also did an amazing job on this series and I love all the extra features. I just adore the entire cast, so much that I found I was really sad once it was all over as so many amazing actors in one series is hard to find.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|I ordered these movies for my son.  They arrived promptly, and I haven't seen him since.  They must be good.
1423124960|2.0|I purchased this book for my friends 1 1/2 yr old daughter, She loves to have books read to her. At this point I do not have any kids so I basically buy almost anything with Princess Tiana for her, especially books! The book has lovely pictures and the silver paint on the pages was nice touch in theory however, some of the pages may be stuck together on some of the books because of the silver. Anyway, I didn't skim through the entire index before I purchased the book, it is that serious for me, but I did make sure the book at least had a story with Princess Tiana in it. I have come across several items that have her picture on the packaging but not on the actual product and therefore I analyze or just avoid certain products. Long story short, the Princess Tiana story isn't even about her specifically which was a little awkward. Compared to all the other princesses who had at least 2-3 stories in the entire book Tiana only had one. I think the story was put together with little care and could have used a lot more creativity. It's just my opinion and I'm sure once my little buddy actually sees and understands the movie she'll feel the same way about this particular story in this book. I was so close to returning the book back to walmart but I figured she's just a baby so it's okay for now.
B003TML0VO|5.0|This is a great CD! Santana and guests do these covers better than the origional artists.  Just a super job!  So refreshing to hear Carlos do somerthing away from his triditional style.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|First off, it's been awhile since I read this book, so the review wouldn't be as good as if I reviewed it right after reading it. This book shows amazing world building, and I can't wait to return to the world in the next book. It is one of the longest books I've read, but I thoroughly enjoyed it. There are amazing fight scenes and story developments, I loved how we learned the story of the main character bit by bit. Also, the interludes were interesting, I'd never really seen an author do that. Overall, I just loved the book, it was probably my second favorite book from 2010.
0061726826|4.0|I'm of two minds on this book. I can't say i didn't tear through it, because I did. For the last three days my husband was like \\"hello- i'm talking to you\\" and i was just nose down in this book. So addictive and enjoyable? totally. 5 stars. Will i read the rest of the trilogy when they come out? definitely. But i can't figure out why, because the writing was tough for me. Oliver literally vomits up a simile every other sentence. Sometimes there's a simile within a simile within a metaphor within a simile and i needed to diagram the sentence to just see what it was she was actually trying to describe. But the melodrama suited the subject so i guess i can't really complain. Well, more than i already have anyways.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, so I shouldn't really be giving the review. I can say, however, that he enjoys every second of it!
B002ZG9940|1.0|Why did the guy who wanted to kill Clooney's character enact such a complicated set up?  He could have just put a bomb in the car that Clooney gets into at the beginning of the movie and finished him off without a problem.  And the hitmen that tried to kill Clooney's character throughout the movies were hilariously bad.  Instead of shooting from behind cover they just stand out in the open and let Clooney gun them down.  Finally, the movie is ridiculously slow and boring.  I wish I could give it negative stars.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not going to tell you how incredibly wonderful this show is - I'm sure you can see that for yourself with all the other rave reviews people have written. What I will tell you is that I recently purchased the Firefly series again (my first copy was given to a friend), so that I could introduce my husband to this show that I've been raving about since we met. (Plus, Jayne reminds me a little of my wonderful husband! LOL)    After the 3rd episode, my husband turned to me and said \\"They cancelled this show WHY?\\" ... needless to say, he loves it as much as I do! The characters are so easy to feel for - you quickly become involved in their lives, and care about what happens to them. A prime example - my husband started asking after the 2nd episode, \\"Does River ever get better?\\"    One of the things I love most about Firefly is that, even though it's set 500 years in the future & on a space ship in another galaxy, you're not inundated with images of these futuristic people, with their blasters & rayguns everywhere. Yes, there is laser technology, but the common person uses weapons that we would see today - handguns, and the occasional sword.    Personally, I think Joss Whedon did an amazing job in creating a future world for humanity, and I really enjoy the blending of Western & Asian cultures in Firefly. It's a believable scenario, and watching Firefly doesn't require that \\"suspension of disbelief\\" so common to most science-fiction programs.    If you're considering buying the Firefly series, don't think about it - do it! You absolutely won't be disappointed - it's a wonderful, engaging program, and well worth your time. Oh! And Nathan Fillion is a Star Wars fan - if you watch some of the scenes closely, you can see (in the background) a miniature of Han Solo in carbonite in some of them.     Yes, \\"Shiny\\" is now part of our regular vocabulary - and I even use some Mandarin slang - \\"Fei Yu\\", for instance!
0142000655|5.0|No one can compete with steinbeck in the weaving of words to convey articulated characters, scenery that as your mind would inform your eye. Its hard to totally understand but the words are invisible and on the pages are people and places you can easily visit. Like a good piece of software, the interface is gone and in its stead is the content. In this case the content is beautiful California valleys, people of beauty and thought. The names mean a person, the person is someone you know when the novel is over.<br /><br />I listened to this book and the narrator did a wonderful job with the voices, accents, and tone of the novel. I'll be re-reading this in the next few years
B0041KKYDI|3.0|It's not possible to see this film without having at least a high level knowledge of the plot.  That is, young man gets trapped by a rock while rock climbing in remote Utah.  The only way to escape is to cut off the offending limb.  This he eventually does and thus struggles his way to safety.<br /><br />However, the above resume is absurdly simplified.  The film uses clever flashbacks together with an entrancing soundtrack to tell a compelling story.  The lead character, Aron Ralston (James Franco) is a very charismatic individual.  The viewer is drawn to him and when he becomes trapped, we are equally bound empathetically to the character.  This is no easy task for a film maker.<br /><br />Yet, for all the skill of the director, there is only so much that can be brought to the screen.  It's an amazing tale but, somehow, it just falls short when seen on the big screen.  However, what does play well on the screen is the empty beauty of the stark southern Utah landscape.  This is stunning and helps to lift the story to greater heights than would otherwise be possible.<br /><br />Is this a great film?  No.  But it is a good film well worth viewing.
B000FBJHT4|3.0|I did like this book, it was entertaining.  The book was interesting up until the author started rambling about stuff that had nothing to do with Roswell.  Also, once he starts rambling it becomes more and more unbelievable; not that Roswell happened, but that his claims about how he solely embedded ideas about modern technology into production are true.  Just take the book for what it is.
B0045EJY90|5.0|Wanted to have a quality deck in my component system for those ocassions when tape is all that is available. This is an excellent deck and a great price.
B004DMIIVO|5.0|I just bought this DVD last night and I've already watched it twice. I'm glad to say that this is something I would definitely be watching again. The plot was so good it kept me on the edge of my seat. I loved how it revolved around being a part of a family and how everyone came together, in more ways than one. The music score fit and was quite entertaining. I would definitely recommend this movie to families young and old.
0307595579|5.0|The series in a box makes a perfect collector's item, espeically with the addition of the book on Stieg and the bonux DVD!
B00364K6YW|5.0|I replaced my VHS taped version of this program done by the BBC and A&E with the restored DVD version, which is absolutely wonderful, and I have shared it with my grandchildren and great grandchildren too...  What a neat way to introduce young people to the classics!  It seems to promote reading these stories as well!
B000001EAQ|5.0|POP is a very special album. If only there was someone that could change Bono's mind on a few decisions he made.  The order of the songs is pure genius but MOFO(just noise) and P mansion (not a song just a poem) should never have been on the record. I have to skip over them. If you skip these two songs you are presented with songs that actually blend together, sharing an incredibly delicious vibe from the first song to the last. (staring at the sun sort of sticks out a little). I can't believe how many reviewers talk about \\"turning the lights out\\" when listening to this record. POP's greatness is that one feels that you are in a private party with U2 in an intimate setting and one feels really close to the band. The Edge is in incredible form and his skill just dominates the album. Bono's vocals on \\"Gone, \\"Dress\\" and \\"Please\\" are outstanding. U2 just exudes coolness on this album. I consider this to be a theme album because of the shared vibe that runs thru it. Try turning off the lights and skip Mofo and mansion and listen to Edge's guitar work. A one-of-a-kind record!    1.Discotheque      2. Do You Feel Loved      3. Mofo      4. If God Will Send His Angels      5. Staring At The Sun      6. Last Night On Earth      7.

B000B5IPDI|5.0|This is undoubtedly the greatest movie I have ever watched in my life. Tim Burton is a genius. If you haven't seen this movie then you haven't seen the greatest movie you will see in your lifetime.
B0006J28BO|5.0|(Warning also rating and reviewing with a 3 year old in mind).<br /><br />My daughter and I love this movie! The english voice cast was an excellent (dare I say purrrfect?) choice for this role. This is such a fun little story for animation lovers, people with children, Adults with kid hearts and everyone in general. This is a story about a young girl who crosses paths with a cat. Eventually complication ensues and she needs the Baron's help!<br /><br />If you are not familiar with the inspiration for this, \\"Whispers of the Heart,\\" Please watch that one as well. You will not be disappointed. I don't think both are necessary to enjoy either one as a stand alone as they are both great movies.<br /><br />The only thing that could be improved was more character development and a longer story! I wanted the movie to be longer and more developed but nonetheless this was great how it was. We enjoyed this so much my daughter quotes the cat king everyday. Thanks a lot cat king, or rather, \\"Thanks a lot Babe.\\"
B000PMLFRA|1.0|I will not buy this set if it does not include the original trilogy! You want to make a lot of money mr. lucas, GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT!!
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|One of the best series out there, followed right after Band of Brothers of course. Well written and directed with so many great actors and actresses! This will be an investment well spent. I bought this while on deployment and it has been watched many times over and I have not yet tired of it.
B0042MEQVG|4.0|I really like the movie; however, one line is flubbed on the dvd. As a matter of fact I returned my original order thinking it was just a defective dvd, but the replacement has the same issue. Scene: Edward and Bella talking outside of sheriff's office. In promo he says, I'll do whatever it takes to protect you.\\" This line is completely left out of the dvd and the line he says is: \\"Do you think people have notice how strange, Alice?\\" It's irritating.
B002ZG9774|5.0|I think this movie was like Moonstruck. In the fact that was released to only 3500 theatre's nation wide, Sony really dropped the ball here, they needed to back it more and put it into more theatre's then that, especially going up against Harry Potter Thanksgiving weekend. It is very well written, well lighted, fun, sexy, and something for everyone. You will fall in love with the Tess and Ali, and Jack. Great music, funny, lots of great one liners. Everyone holds there own in this movie. If it was backed better and released in more theatre's like Moonstruck eventually was, it would have became a hit because people started to pick up that it was a great movie. Burlesque is full on entertaiment. I also left feeling like my money was well spent. In fact I saw it four times and took five people and some of my straight friends that went just loved it. My father also took his girlfreind and they both are how not huge Cher or Christina fans, but loved it. Dad cant wait for it on DVD. It's to bad people didn't pick up on it sooner. Now with it on Blu-Ray DVD you can watch it over and over and then see what I mean about an all around great time. If you want to escape your everyday life for 2 hours this is a movie for you. After all that is movies are all about! Enjoy!!!
B003EY7IRC|5.0|With anticipation of avid readers of the series...this was SO worth the wait. All your questions are answered with room for even more should the story continue...  I couldn't wait for the release, and read it so fast it was over before I was ready! Great story with vivid characters. I feel like I know them personally rooting for my favorites and booing my vilians all the while.  I loved everything about this series, and hope many more people read it and enjoy the action, suspense, romance and mystery of it all.    GREAT JOB and can't wait for more!!    Thanks for a WONDERFUL ride!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a show that has fans among the most diverse bunch of people - I'm always running into people who don't normally like scifi who know, and love, this show.  Probably, like me, they never saw it broadcast - but it is definitely worth watching on DVD.
1594481784|3.0|It's an okay book, the movie was made almost verbatim... I am finding the book to be a little slow but well written.
031603438X|4.0|So here's the thing. I bought the book for my husband, himself a musician, as he'd been eying it and basically asked me to get it for him. (You gotta' love that. It makes buying the right gift a cinch!) But I didn't read it myself (thus the cheating part). I did want to write about it, though, because he normally takes a long time to finish a book, but he whipped through this tome in about a week and loved it. I have never seen him enjoy a gift that much! This will be my only review of a book that I did not read, I promise, but I really felt the need to comment on how much it grabbed him.     So I give it four stars because something that hooked my husband like that must be fascinating and well-written. Just my two cents.
1433515164|5.0|I use this bible in between church and home to under stand more. It's great to witness to someone. Our associate pastor was talking about the Roman Road to Salvation. I went home got out this bible, started reading and this book had everything he was talking about and more. I bought my mom a copy and she's very happy I like to read out of my KJV bible and study out of this bible very understanding. This is one great book.
0439023521|5.0|So I had heard a description of this book on NPR one day and was interested in the idea but thought, \\"No way I'm going to read it. Sounds creepy and depressing.\\" The older I get, the less I can tolerate sad/disturbing movies, books, etc. But then a colleague read it and raved (like so many) \\"I could not. put. this book. down. You would love it!\\" Fast-forward another year and I decided to start a Young Adult Fiction Book Club with friends. This was our first book choice, so I finally committed to reading it. As you may have guessed, I could not put the darned thing down. It was not depressing (not to me anyway) but simply fascinating. It is the kind of read that makes you feel like you are a kid again, furiously turning the pages to find out what happens next. (Incidentally, all the book club members started emailing each other about how much we all loved the book and how we could hardly wait to talk about it.)    Again, like so many who have talked about this book, I am not a fan of science fiction, but this is sort of in its own category. The characters, the motivations, the overarching plot, it is all unending food for thought. I want to say so much more, but don't want to even taint the first-time-reading experience for any of the book's potential readers. It is such fun to walk into this with no expectations! Enjoy the voyage! Oh, and just to save you time, go ahead and order the other two sequel books now, because you're going to want to reach for them when you get to the last page. I have Catching Fire ready and waiting on my nightstand. Luckily it's Saturday night so if I can't put this one down and lose a night's sleep, so be it!    Have fun!
0385528752|4.0|I bought this book because of all the buzz. I learned about it through Dave Ramsey's site.  After reading it, I have some mixed feelings.  Before I review it, I want to let you know that I read a lot of self-help stuff as well as positive psychology.  I've heard the message of goals, change, happiness, motivation, etc., many times before so unless a book stands out or is remarkable, I can't give it five stars.<br /><br />The first thing that will catch you with this book is the attractive cover.  It's one of the better ones I have seen in a while and when you notice the cover, you certainly will want to pick it up and read it.  I bought this book because I needed to basically overhaul my life at 28 years of age.  I want to change but I didn't know why change was not happening in my life despite all of my good intentions.<br /><br />The Heath brothers argue that change can be visualized by three components working together in harmony. You have the rider, the elephant, and the path.  The rider represents the idea of change, the elephant is the motivation and the emotional side of the change, and the path is our environment regarding the change.  For a change to occur, you have to visualize the rider and the elephant happily strolling down the desired path to the goal. Change will not occur when the elephant won't move, when the rider can't control and direct him, and if the path is not clear, or is undefined.  I thought this was an interesting metaphor. You, as the rider, may want to make a change but if you are not motivated or you can't get other people motivated, the elephant won't move and change will not happen.  If you do have the motivation, you need to make sure that your environment is conducive to this change or else the idea will not go anywhere or worse, someplace undesired. A basic example would be like this...You need to lose weight(rider) and you want to look good by the summer time(elephant), so you throw away all the junk food in the house, you exercise, and you learn how to eat properly(the path).  That's the basic idea but the book expands on the framework of each step even more.<br /><br />The book is made up of many stories which are broken up into these three components. There are about 260 reading pages and I was able to finish this book in a day.  The book is well-written.  It is easy to read, there are only a few big words and it flows very well.<br /><br />My impressions of the book are as follows: I felt that the book was longer than it needed to be. I enjoyed reading it but I didn't feel that there was 260 pages worth of information.  The message of the rider, elephant, and path could have honestly been put together in a two-page article and could be explained in a 100 page book.  There are many stories to illustrate one point and I felt that if you understood any one of the stories, than you could probably skip the rest. Some of the stories were a little boring to read because I could not relate to them.<br /><br />I want to also say that the framework of change that is described in this book is very basic and not universal. For example, I believe that if you are a very shy person and you have trouble asking a girl out because of either social issues or a fear of rejection, you might need therapy or counseling to help find, understand, and get \\"your elephant\\" moving. The rider might already be there and ready to go and the path might be laid out for you. You want to make the change but you just cannot understand the elephant and the change ultimately does not occur. The rider is a slave to the elephant.  I wanted to see a better explanation of this type of change.  The explanations and stories in this book were more about change regarding new ideas or improving old ones.<br /><br />Other than that, I thought it was a decent book. It's not a life-changing book but it helps you to see the message of how to change in a new perspective and the delivery is effective. The metaphor of the rider, elephant, and path has certainly \\"stuck\\" with me. I think the book is more business oriented. A lot of the examples deal with change in a business and social setting.  I was hoping that the message would be universal but there were not a whole lot of stories here regarding personal change.  If it is personal change you desire, I think you have to look to Brian Tracy, John C. Maxwell, and others.<br /><br />Overall, good message, repetitive, but worth the read.the book is more business oriented. A lot of the examples deal with change in a business and social setting.

1596177373|5.0|I have to confess I ordered this thinking of it more as a collector item than a playing deck of cards. I was quite impressed with the quality of the cards when I finally got them that I have decided I will use them instead. They do feel well made, though I think it would have been better if they were made out of plastic, to prevent any bent cards.<br /><br />The designs are pretty neat and consist of characters drawn out from the [[ASIN:0060526491 Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and Other Stories]] book by Tim Burton. Characters like Toxic Boy, Stain Boy, Mummy Boy and others, are used to represent the Ace, Jack, Queen, King and Joker.<br /><br />The design in the numbered cards does not contain any pictures in them, other than the correspondent suit (clubs, diamonds, hearts and spades), like any regular deck of cards does. Why would anyone expect these to have characters in them is beyond me, if you have ever played cards you should very well know this is the way all sets are supposed to be.<br /><br />Having said that, for the price, I do recommend you get these, I have added a picture to the product description page so you can see the remaining cards not included in the Amazon photo. If you play cards and are looking for a novelty item, these are definitely for you, I know I am going to order a couple extra sets to give away to friends.
044654759X|2.0|A friend lent me her copy of this book, and at first the story was an interesting read. Then I got to the part where the main female character tells her next door neighbor about her \\"friend\\" who was in an abusive relationship, and escaped from her husband. Uh-huh. It doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure out that it is really her who is escaping from her abusive husband and is on the run from, and that the abusive ex is trying to hunt her down and find her.     Honestly, it read like a Lifetime movie-of-the-week.     This story was very predictable, with a predictable ending. (Psst! The ex dies. Big surprise - not!)
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have read this book almost ten times and each time I read it I realize more things about myself through Enders experiances. I also just want to say that the book s expertly written for a 14 guy who just wants a plainly written easily understandable book.
030746363X|5.0|Great book - very thick but easy to read the parts that pertain to the eating plan and then expand your learning regarding more specific facts.    I'm finding it difficult to \\"stick to\\" the plan as there is no little variety and no fruit.  However, the weeks I adhered to the plan, I lost weight and inches.  Lots of beans and eggs in the early AM, which is also a challenge for me.  But, I'm never hungry - just have to fight the normal desire to snack on the \\"wrong\\" thing.

B002JVWR0Y|3.0|This isn't a review of the quality of the show, but of the quality of the Blu-Ray disks. I ordered this from Amazon. I tried to play disk one in my sony 570 and it would not work. It went to the BD Live menu and everything froze. I then tried to play it in a PS3 Slim and had the same problem. I returned the set to Amazon and asked for a replacement. The replacement was delivered and I had the same problems on the same two machines. I also tried to play it on an old style PS3 and had the same problem.    I searched online for people having similar problems and found some others were having the same problem. A poster suggested turning off internet access on the player to see if it would go to the Main menu. I tried this in the Sony 570 and it went to the BD Live menu and had the same problem. Then I hit the play button and it did go to the main menu. The first episode started playing when I chose it in the menu. I turned off the player and tried the workaqround on the PS3 and could not get to the main menu.    All of the machines had the most recent firmware updates.    I'm returning the replacement to Amazon and going out to Best Buy to buy Season Four on DVD.

B002L5GQGY|2.0|What a major dissappointment. Camera was all over the place, and not on the fingers and main attraction. Music was so so at best. Picture and sound quality was non-existant. Overall a huge let down. I had just bought and recieved TOTO'S music DVD. Now that, my friends is a quality live presentation. I have a pretty fair amount of live music dvds. This one is not even a keeper. I wish there was a fair return policy. I would certainly try to recover my loss.
B00406UK7S|1.0|I have a couple of friends that tend to have an appetite for low grade B movies, as long as they 1) have massive, blatant dumb and in your face violence; 2) pretty girls carrying guns or weapons  in skimpy outfits and 3) deals with some type of sci-fi, fantasy or horror theme. As soon as they popped this mess of a movie in, I had no idea what I was in for. You can call this a \\"Gladiator\\" or \\"300\\" wannabe film, but in the end, it's exploitation over the top gore for the sake of shock. Not much of a plot, just alot of running around, chopping off heads in the most brutal, in your face manner than most cinema. No mercy from this idiot of a director.  Plot, acting and empathy go out the window for this movie. If you are some pimpled face, Call of Duty playing teen fanboy, this may be the ticket for you. For all others who enjoy an historic film with some decorum of taste, go somewhere else, PLEAAAASSEE!
B004BLJQOK|4.0|Let Me In is a surprisingly well made remake of the Swedish film \\"Let the Right One In\\". Mostly because the direction, locations, camera shots and the atmosphere all feel about the same. The movie is good because the Swedish film was and because this is pretty much the same movie. Yet, I never felt bored watching it and was about as entertained by it as I was by the Swedish version.
6305128952|1.0|I recently received the above mentioned DVD from Amazon. I am very unhappy with it. It is of very poor quality, many of the scenes are so dark that you cannot even tell what is going on. Due to this I will not be ordering any more DVD's from you. As this is one my favorite movies I am very disappointed. Thank you for the opportunity to review this product.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|Paranormal Activity 2 was creepy and about as well made as the first film, that is until the ending.... The couple from the first film thrown into the movie with Katie being the sister of the mother of part 2, didn't really work for me.<br />  Katie being in this one is just convenient for the lazy ending that doesn't give us anything original. It's a shame too, since a lot of this sequel is actually better than the first film.
0439023513|3.0|Oh Suzanne...why did you do it? You could have nicely wrapped up the series. Followed the path everyone wanted but you didn't. The last 25% percent of the book it a very disappointing end to the series. This little story is the best way I can describe what happened in this last book. The family is out for a drive. We all know where the drive ends but just before we get there Mom says let's get off the nicely paved roads and see the back roads. The roads are rough and the car bounces all over the place. You see some things you wouldn't have if you stayed on the nice paved road but really you could careless. Also on your little detour you end up loosing some items out of the car. No reason for it to happen it just does. Eventually the drive ends at your destination but you are a little ticked off at Mom because she just had to take the unnecessary detour.   I gave Hunger Games five stars. Catching Fire four stars. I'm being generous in giving Mockingjay three. When it really comes down to it 10% of Mockingjay is five stars. 65% is four stars and 25% is one star. It really bugs me when authors make a conscience effort not to do what everyone thinks they should even though they have for 80% of the story. Just give us what we want. Suzanne why did you have to mess it up.
B0021L8V0M|3.0|CIA Officer Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) finds herself on the run after she's accused of being a Russian spy. The movie has plenty of well done action and Salt is also well acted.<br />  However, the movie just gets silly after awhile and I found the twist of who's bad and who's good rather predictable. While the film never hooked me enough to make me say in the end \\"I can't wait for more!\\". So Salt is hardly Bourne with a woman.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I loved Hunger Games. It was great. Everything about it as far as a futuristic fictional story of post massive earth catastrophe could be. Hunger Games ended at a point where you instantly wanted more. What happened next? It was killing me. I immediately downloaded Catching Fire. I was again very happy with the book. It was only a small step below Hunger Games but maybe that was because my expectations had already been set. Collins again does a good job of mixing fiction/fantasy story telling with a realistic sense.<br />The bottom line is if you thought Hunger Games was great then read Catching Fire. If you haven't read Hunger Games read it before starting this book. At the end of this book you will again want to continue on to Mockingjay (the third and final book).
0307454541|1.0|I ordered this book on Amazon and was really excited to receive it.  I read through about 5 chapters and I just could not get into it.  I am an avid reader and I believe that a book needs to pull you in.  This one just did not do that for me.

B004BJMEO6|5.0|This film is beautifully set, excellent lighting, deliciously acted and unexpectedly funny. This film certainly raises the bar for LGBT film. This is true women's storytelling at its finest. Outstanding, if I had ten thumbs they would all be raised up.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I loved this book!  I don't mind the Kindle price and I don't agree with punishing the author with bad reviews because of a price set by the publisher.
0553805371|4.0|I find myself often reading popular physics because I keep looking for God.  I usually search for God in science, because I consider myself rational, but as Hawking points out in the Grand Design what is rational from the perspective of an earth centered human mind, is becoming less so as physicists tries to explain the inconsistencies of their observations based on Relativity and Quantum Mechanics.   He starts with a discussion of models and that Gods and God are examples of an early model created by the human mind to understand  his world.  I understood most of this part of the Hawking discussion, but I have to admit that I have a very limited imagination, and even with glossy pictures and a seemingly simple text without the math, I still can't get my head around the ideas put forward in the book, because most of what is being talked about are imaginings that have never been observed.  The analogies that are made  don't quite describe anything I have been a witness to. I have read often about the curvature of space, and pictures are drawn to explain it but the pictures always depict the fabric of space in two dimensions when you have to extrapolate from the two dimensional figures printed on the page that in fact the space curvature is in three dimensions if you think also that space and time are the same dimension. Getting my mind around the full implications  of what the reality means is just too advanced for my comprehension so even on the most elementary level what Hawking is saying in this book takes on a vague mushiness in my mind. The discussion on the behavior of an electron is all about uncertainty, and that uncertainty is front and center in my understanding that an electron is both a particle and a wave.  The drawings of some of the possibilities of the path of a particle still left me confused. I had read about string theory previously and had imagined strings existed in multi-verse and  that in the universe I inhabit the string appears as a particle.  This I gather is not an accurate imagining. The idea of dimensions curled I suppose like a nautilus doesn't give me anything like an understanding of what that means. Science has it's rituals, and it's beliefs.  Science at one time was about the truth and that truth came from observation.  Physics was considered a hard science because it could be proved by mathematics, but all those old beliefs have flown by the wayside.  Physics has become more about mind gymnastics, where observation is extremely indirect and usually only inferred, which brings physics back to a metaphysical realm.    I guess where I  disagree with Hawking, is his extremely limited description of God as the creator.  He takes some very old conceptions of God, and disproves them adroitly, but I think that in the same sense that our understanding of the universe is evolving, I tend to also believe our (or at least my) understanding of God is evolving.  I speculate the order of the universe as God. When physicists  search so diligently and relentlessly for the Grand Unifying Theory, Perhaps M Theory, that they are in fact discovering the mechanics of God, and the major reasons why these questions about the Universe are so compelling is to understand the purpose of our existence. My theory is that the drive, behind the quest is not to disprove the existence of God, but to understand the Grand Mystery; that the understanding the Grand Design will lead to an understanding of the purpose.  Hawking does not speculate on purpose. He doesn't explain why he wants to learn more, but he does bring up the predictive aspects of scientific understanding.  Once you know what is going on you can predict what will happen next because you are at some point of a process that leads to another point. Maybe that is a small step to the point of it all.
B0010SKSTO|5.0|After reading this book and watching \\"lie to me\\", I would say, at least the theory of detecting microexpression is complete. However, the real practice is a matter of another magnitude. Normal daily chat doesn't require you to read people. And if you find yourself in a due situation, you will realize what the author said in the book, you have only got 50% chance to get it right.    All right, you can't control others and tell them how to behave when they have emotions. Even so, I find this book fascinating because you can use it on yourself. Knowing how to read people, you will also know how not to be read by people. For example, give up the childish \\"thumb in the pocket\\" stance while you don't want to look nervous or unprofessional. And you'd better conceal your disgust after your opponent's remark if your goal is to win the audience.    Delightful read and totally worth the money.
B003YLM78K|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters and it became an instant favorite.  To me it isn't Christmas without watching this, Elf and A Christmas Story.      The story is very wide arcing weaving together the snipets of different folks and their individual stories.  They are all intertwined brilliantly.      If you object to nudity this might not be the movie for you but the actual nude scenes are done not only \\"tastefully\\" but with humor.      The film features some major players with Hugh Grant, Emma Thompson, Alan Rickman and Colin Firth.

0553381407|4.0|In its first part Toxic Parents is really good about connecting symptoms to causes in adult children of toxic parents. And while the second part has some good exercises to work on in your healing from the abuse it is lacking in the moral clarity, not expressing a whole lot more doubts about the type of relationship possible with a toxic parent who does not respond positively to your trying to change the relationship. It leaves open the possibility that you might not want to have anything to do with a parent, but fails to explore the fact that wanting to remain in a weird place where you've confronted your parent and they've rejected that and you still want to be around them is indicative of still unprocessed feelings and a lack of true perspective on what was done to you. It fails to ask the question, would you continue to be satisfied with a relationship AT ALL with some random person who raped or beat or savagely criticized you?
B003JSSPSY|5.0|This DVD isn't available in Europe so I had to order it overseas, however it arrived alright and within three weeks. The quality is great but European buyers should be conscious it's coded (regoincode 1) so you have to reprogram your dvdplayer. I'm a big Goodkind fan and though the tv-series take liberties in the story it's very good and addictive. I'm hooked!!

B0002O7XW2|4.0|Poor Arnie just can't catch a break. He's the school's prototypical nerd and resident punching bag for his meathead classmates. Even worse, he can't get a date, can't get his locker open and can't beat his mom at [[ASIN:B00000IWDB Scrabble]]. All of that changes the day he meets Christine. Sure, Christine is a little rough on the eyes and she's been around the block more than a few times, but she's got a great body and really knows how to ride. Problem is, Christine has a hot temper and her loyalty to Arnie is matched only by her thirst for blood. Christine is no ordinary girl; she's a 1958 Plymouth Fury and she's taking Arnie for the ride of his life.<br /><br />Keith Gordon plays no more Mr. Nice Guy Arnie Cunningham and watching his transformation from awkward geek to cocky hothead is half of the film's fun. The other half, of course, is watching the film's titular character mow down its owner's classmates in varied grisly fashion. Director John Carpenter - already a certified Master of Horror by this point - steers the course steadily with ample character build-up, signature creepy music and, of course, mounting tension. You sort of forget the ridiculousness of the premise because not only does Carpenter pull out all the stops, but also because Keith Gordon sells his character so well. Of course, the true star of the show, Christine (reportedly played by 21 different cars) steals the thunder with some of the more memorable moments being her birth (witness George Thorogood's \\"Bad to the Bone\\" before it was trite and clich&eacute;d) and her own stop-motion rebuilding which had to be painstaking yet entertaining to try to film. There are things in the film that you simply won't see elsewhere, guaranteed.<br /><br />Truth be told, \\"Christine\\" isn't without a few speed bumps. In all honesty, it's a little long-winded and there's this nagging feeling by the end of it all that something is missing. More specifically, we never quite find out why Christine is the way she is. Does she need an oil change? Does she have a tear in her upholstery? The film loses a bit of credibility by not at least trying to establish a reason for Christine's madness. Even still, it's a thoroughly entertaining film if you love revenge-fantasies and/or cars. At the very least, it's one of the best Stephen King adaptations amidst some pretty mediocre fare. It won't make you fear muscle cars, but maybe you'll think twice about defecating on someone's dashboard ever again.oil change? Does she have a tear in her upholstery?

0375847227|5.0|I finished this epic in a few days. Wow. A modern fantasy in the best of those words, not with the almost childish fantasies of the normal Disney-esque children fantasies, nor with the spank-you-over-the-head moral teachings of dogmatic institutions, this is humanity at its best. There's a reason this trilogy is so wildly popular in dozens of countries, and it's a tragic shame that the U.S.A. is so behind and repellant to its message. Say no to kingdoms everywhere. Let's build a new republic.
B004HD2ZIQ|4.0|Another solid album from Motorhead, but in all honesty a bit of a disappointment after the last 3 albums.  Inferno, Kiss of Death, and Motorizer were all phenomenal albums with great, memorable songs and even a few surprises.  The World Is Yours has a few great, stand-out songs, but not as many as the past few albums, and there are no real stylistic twists or new ground broken here (ie. the acoustic Whorehouse Blues, or the organ on Take the Blame).  Actually this may be my least favorite Motorhead album of the modern Lemmy/Campbell/Dee lineup, but it's still a good album, 100% pure Motorhead, and thoroughly worth your money...just not until you've already got all the other albums!
0743496736|4.0|This was an excellent glimpse into the life of high school kids and even brought me back to some of the pain and isolation I'd felt as a teenager. Although my experience wasn't anywhere near as difficult as Peter's, I could easily identify.<br /><br />I've only read one other work of hers (Sister's Keeper), but I notice Ms. Picoult has a talent for making us sympathize on some level with people who should be villains and having contempt for those who would otherwise be victims. A lesson that things are not always what they seem from a story in a newspaper or on television news.<br /><br />I think this should be required reading for all high school students and even parents, especially in light of all the school violence that seems to be on the rise.

B004HWR406|3.0|I cannot understand what others have seen in this movie to support its great hype. It's an average story about a massive web business with reasonable acting and not much else. Just because Facebook, the company, is so massive doesn't mean the movie is automatically good, even if people are very interested in the background story of how it got started.<br /><br />Quite how it got nominated for 8 Oscars, I\\"ll never know (apart from pure hype). No-one in the move stands out for their acting - no-one is bad, they're just doing their bit like any other actor and the storyline just bumbles along till someone is done out of their money unfairly.<br /><br />After all the hype, I found it to be very disappointing.
0670022411|4.0|I don't want to give away too many spoilers, so I'll try to make this short and sweet before I start a ramble that will tell every plot point.     I picked this one up partially because of the hype and partially because the summary sounded fascinating. I wasn't disappointed. I found myself immersed from the first page and had a hard time putting this book down. I love the idea of these species - witch, daemon, vampire, and human - being linked genetically. I loved that the main character actually seemed like she was an academic. Many books just tell you that this person or that is smart, established, hard-working, etc.  but either don't back it up with at least one scene, or have the character do things that are the complete antithesis of what we are told. Anyway, I didn't notice it in this book.     For the most part, I enjoyed the pacing. Yes, there were occasional slow (but yet still interesting) parts of the book, but I can't say that detracted from my enjoyment. I loved the characters, the descriptions, the story.    So...cutting it short now...I enjoyed this book immensely. The only thing I don't enjoy is waiting for the next one. :-/    P.S. I can't help myself here, and I have to mention that if you don't like the Kindle price, complain to the publisher. It's not the author's fault and giving one-star reviews because of one's dissatisfaction with pricing is not only pointless, but also hurting the author.
B000ASDFJU|5.0|What a great series! Was great to watch in sequence without the hassle of waiting week to week. Plus, you can watch your favorite episodes over and over again!
B002ZG99N6|4.0|I was harsh with Ben Affleck and his directorial debut, `Gone Baby Gone'.  After reflection, maybe I was a tad too harsh (although the film is still far from anything truly inspired).  That said, one thing I did find commendable in his debut was, well, his direction, which was sharp and thrilling to say the least.  With `The Town', his sophomore effort, Affleck proves that his greatest asset is his knack for creating a riveting film, despite obvious flaws and drawbacks.<br /><br />I don't think it would be too far fetched to presume Ben Affleck will win an Oscar in the near future for direction; ala Kevin Costner, Mel Gibson and Robert Redford (you know, those other popular actors who never could `act' their way to an Oscar).<br /><br />Thrusting a little more weight on his shoulders this go around, Ben Affleck not only directs but co-writes and co-stars in this crime thriller that piles on the clich&eacute;s while maintaining a slick and engrossing presence.  The film centers on a Boston thug named Doug MacRay.  Doug and his longtime friends make their money robbing banks.  On the outset of the film, Doug and his posse rob a bank and, when Doug's friend Jem loses his head, they wind up with a hostage.  That hostage is bank manager Claire.  Claire is obviously petrified, but that fear doesn't leave her when the whole episode is over.  She carries the burden with her.  When Jem decides he wants her out of the picture entirely, Doug takes it upon himself and make sure she isn't going to rat them out.  He does this by falling in love with her.  Unfortunately, the cops trailing Doug are smart enough to erode this newfound relationship and use it to their advantage.  Couple that with the fact that Doug's `friends' won't let him just walk away from their way of life and you have major problems for Doug and his perilous search for redemption.<br /><br />The film's premise and script are littered with holes and clich&eacute; ridden errors that keep the film from being anything truly spectacular.  The dynamics between Claire and Doug and believable in chemistry alone, but their relationship is beyond illogical.  The friendships and loyalties boil down to recklessness and don't carry any true weight because the film isn't beyond turning every character into a liar.  The ensemble cast has received a lot of praise but in all honesty there is really only one performance that actually stands out as heartfelt, and that is Rebecca Hall.  Sure, the character is sadly underwritten in areas (it could have been a drag-down, knockout, Oscar winning piece of work had it had a little more color) but she makes so much out of it.  It bothers me that Jeremy Renner's serviceable performance stole all the media attention.<br /><br />Really though, this film lives and breathes in the hands of Ben Affleck and his directorial choices.  The film is just so alive.  He really knows how to make every frame sing, and he creates such body out of every surface he films.  The thrills all feel legitimate.  He makes the standard (and overdone) car chase seem fresh and exciting.  He created so many layers out of a script that was, at times, layerless.  It is really a commendable piece of work and one that I think truly deserves the attention and praise it can garner.<br /><br />He has a skill, and I can't wait to see him fine-tune it even more.cs between Claire and Doug and believable in chemistry alone, but their relationship is beyond illogical.

B001UV4XI8|5.0|Director David Yates has done it yet again with the seventh installment in this incredible fantasy series. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are now out in the world on their own, tracking down the seven deadly Horcruxes, and nowhere is safe. I love the new cast additions (including Rhys Ifans as Xenophilius Lovegood, Bill Nighy as Rufus Scrimgeour, Nick Moran as Scabior, etc.), the cinematography, the score, and the faithfulness to the exciting book its based on. I would definitely say this is the best, darkest and most thrilling Potter yet; a recommendation goes without saying. I cannot wait for the final installment this summer.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|There is something so wonderfully smart and charming about `Despicable Me', a cute animated film that understands that balance between funny and heartwarming.  It made me laugh and it made me cry, and that was so needed!<br /><br />The film is kind of crazy but then again, it works so brilliantly because it isn't ashamed of its apparent lack of logic.  The film centers around a super villain, Gru.  Gru is pretty dumb actually.  He wants funding for from the secret villain organization for his latest venture into villainy (he wants to steal the moon) but all funding is going to some new kid, Vector; a young and ambitious and obnoxious super villain who happens to have ties to the agency.  Gru makes it his personal quest to outdo Vector.  Rather ridiculously, Gru thinks that adopting three orphan girls who sell cookies will help him in his quest (like I said, this doesn't make the most sense, but it embraces that quality, which really helps).  What Gru finds though, is that these three little brats are getting in the way of his villainous ways.<br /><br />In the end he needs to decide if he wants to be `superbad' or `superdad'.<br /><br />I know that a lot of people have had issues with the films construction and overall plot.  It is out there, believe me, but it SOOOOOO works.  The greatest thing I can say about this movie is that it is really, really funny.  I mean, in a world where animated features are determined to take the place of live actions dramas to such an extreme that nearly every animated feature made has to involve such mature themes to target the parents over the children, `Despicable Me' entertained my daughter to ridiculous heights.  It knows that it has to bring the funny to serve its purpose.  On top of that, it sprinkled in the needed suruppy cheese in order to get a tear to fall, but it did it in a way that poked fun at its own manipulations.<br /><br />This film has fun, and so you have fun with it too.<br /><br />I loved it, wholeheartedly.  If it weren't for my total adoration for `Toy Story 3', I'd easily say this was the best animated film of the year.  Sadly, it's second banana.`Toy Story 3', I'd easily say this was the best animated film of the year.  Sadly, it's second banana.
B004BJMEO6|3.0|I am very picky when it comes to Lesbian movies because I have been let down time after time. I do have to say that this movie is better then other's I've seen, the kissing scene was amazing, and the actresses were beautiful of course. With that said it was a bit unrealistic and a bit cliche. I was a bit disappointed because it could have been a great movie, but it was just OK. Watch it and judge for yourself, I always love to support lesbian films.
B0041T52S6|5.0|Certain films just have that special something that makes them, well, special.  `Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is one of those films.  It just oozes with this quality that makes it so endearing, so versatile, so original; so memorable.<br /><br />I can't stop thinking about it.<br /><br />The film revolves around Scott, a nerdy twenty-two year old who has been wronged by the one girl he loved and so he kind of meanders through ridiculous relationships while holing up with his gay sidekick, Wallace.  Currently dating a high-school girl named Knives (she's Asian), Scott finds all his senses blown by the presence of Ramona Flowers.  She's totally out of his league, but he has to have her.  When she shows an odd interest in him, he gets a ridiculous email about fighting some band of exes to the death but takes none of it seriously until one of them shows up at the Battle of the Bands that his band is currently sparring off within and Scott soon starts kicking some serious butt.<br /><br />All in the name of love; right?<br /><br />Yes, the film has some issues (namely the ending, which lasts forever) but it is all forgivable thanks to the films brilliant construction.  Edited to the max and detailed marvelously, `Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' is lush and exciting, with a `no holds bar' type of feel that just generates so much anticipation in the audience.  The film is just so engaging; so...fun.<br /><br />Michael Cera likes to play the same character a lot, but he's really good at it.  I want to see him stretch his humor, but he has a great resume of films that benefit from his signature delivery, so why mess with a good thing; right?  He creates a character he will be remembered for in Scott.  The rest of the cast is also on top of their game, whether they are reduced to a cameo that they totally milk (like Chris Evans) or they have the best role in the film and totally nail it (Kieran Culkin, who should have generated some serious awards buzz).<br /><br />The big star here is Edgar Wright, who stylishly decorates this film in a way that draws you in with every frame.  Perfectly draping the set with sound and visuals worthy of our time, Wright created a real `feeling' with this film.  It is a piece of art; definitely not your average `teen flick'.<br /><br />Sure, the poignancy of the whole thing can be debatable, but when all is said and done, `Scott Pilgrim vs. The World' was a ravishing breathe of fresh air; a way to take a tired subject and make it feel new again.<br /><br />Honestly, one of the best of the year!s this film in a way that draws you in with every frame.

B003L20IFQ|2.0|Don't delude yourself with this dreadful drivel!<br /><br />Spanish director Rodrigo Cort&eacute;s and scenarist Chris Sparling take a surefire predicament straight out of the annals of horror writer Edgar Allan Poe about an individual trapped inextricably in a coffin and take it for a grim 21st century spin.  Poe lived in fear that he would appear to die and his apparently lifeless body would prompt authorities to consign him to a coffin.  Later, he would wake up underground with nowhere to go and nobody to save him.  The death-like trance that obsessed Poe is called catalepsy, and America's foremost horror author penned his memorable short story \\"The Premature Burial\\" about it.  Moviegoers who haven't read the Poe story or seen an adaptation might favorably compare \\"Buried\\" to either French director George Sluizer's intense abduction chiller \\"The Vanishing\\" (1988) or his American remake of it with Jeff Bridges in 1993.  The thing that sets the flawed Cort&eacute;s apart from it is that everything occurs in the coffin in \\"Buried.\\"<br /><br />In \\"Buried,\\" an innocent, average, blue-collar, working-class guy, Paul Conroy (Ryan Reynolds of \\"Blade Trinity\\"), awakens with a jolt to find himself entombed in a wooden crate buried six feet underground with no way to escape.  Our hero has no idea how he wound up in the coffin.  During a brief inventory, he discovers that he has a Zippo lighter, his Hamilton wristwatch, some glow sticks, a faulty flashlight, a knife, and a Blackberry cell phone with a battery that needs a recharge.  Desperately, Paul tries to contact anybody who can rescue him, but he gets either answering machine messages or busy signals.  Eventually, he contacts a 911 operator, an FBI agent, and later on an Embassy employee with a British accent.  In every instance, he has to indulge his contacts with an explanation about his incredible situation and admittedly gets very rude and profane with them when they ask him imbecilic questions.<br /><br />As it turns out, Paul worked as a civilian contractor driving a truck in Iraq in 2006.  Insurgents attacked his convoy, massacring everybody else, but they spared Paul for something infinitely worse. They took him hostage while he was still unconscious and buried him alive.  Indeed, Paul doesn't know where they have buried him.  The villains give him an ultimatum. Not only must he make a YouTube video with a script written out for him, but he also must raise $5 million for his ransom.  Moreover, Paul has only about two hours to complete this onerous task before he exhausts air in his coffin. Just to emphasize the hopelessness of his predicament, Cort&eacute;s and Sparling reveal that our hero only has $700 in his bank account.  Paul is a nobody with a wife and a young son.<br /><br />Mind you, the suspense and tension that Cortes and Sparling generate is of the intense, white-knuckled variety, and \\"Buried\\" is pretty gripping until the bottom falls out during last few moments and the tension dissolves in a heartbeat.  There is nothing mesmerizing, brilliant, or groundbreaking about this cynical bit of manipulation.  Worse, Cort&eacute;s and Sparling stick in moments that defy credibility.  At one point, a poisonous black snake slithers out of our protagonist's pants and curls up in the far corner of the coffin.  How did the snake get into the coffin, especially since our doomed hero slams his body around in the enclosure for at least a half-hour or moment in an act of hysterical madness?  The surprise, in a sense, is that the snake didn't bite Paul. The reptile crawls away and never returns.<br /><br />Ultimately, the payoff in \\"Buried\\" comes as a horrendous letdown.  In a memorable suspense thriller, the filmmakers often reward the audience for their extreme patience, but Cortes and Sparling provide nothing in the way of relief. They provide an ending that serves only to frustrate us for watching a sympathetic character suffer a fate beyond anything that is imaginable. The only catharsis in \\"Buried\\" is that there is no catharsis, just a cop-out of the most misguided sort.  Indeed, the formula for a good movie involves the use of surprises and reversals.  The ending here qualifies as a surprise, but it is the kind of surprise that makes you wish that you had never seen this movie.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds does a commendable job of winning our approbation.  Sadly, the protagonist emerges as nothing more than a pawn of corporate America, vengeful Iraqis, and derisive filmmakers.  The company that employed our hero terminates him the day that the insurgents abducted and confined him in the coffin because he had violated a non-fraternization clause.  Apparently, Paul engaged in some kind of relationship with another employee.  \\"Buried\\" treats its hero with a complete lack of compassion.  You will feel cheated by the depressing ending.  Presumably, Lionsgate did not release \\"Buried\\" to theaters after they promoted the 95-minute film because studio executives feared that the wretched wrap-up would alienate audiences rather than entertain them.<br /><br />Aside from Reynolds' convincing portrait of claustrophobic hysteria under dire conditions, actor Stephen Tobolowsky makes the greatest impression as CRT company representative Alan Davenport who strings poor Paul along in one scene about a contract violation.  Unless you enjoy movies that paint you into a corner that not even Houdini could have gotten out of, \\"Buried\\" with its muddled conspiratorial world politics and heavily accented villain is not worth the anxiety.  What could have been a terrific movie turns out to be just a cinematic gimmick about a guy in a box.  Nevertheless, Cort&eacute;s and company produced this low-budget melodrama for $2 million and it has raked in $18-million, making it a hit despite its limited showings.ust a cop-out of the most misguided sort.

B003DZX44I|4.0|The movie is a classic.  The new added scenes are sometimes annoying since I remember the original, but my daughter still loves them.  To each their own.    What makes me mad is that the movie came with a promise of a charm something or other.  My daughter was really excited about it, but when we went online to get it they were sold out.  In fact I looked online and apparently from what I can tell they only made enough charms for like 1/100,000 of the movies sold so chances are you wouldn't get one.  I know I bought the movie for the movie not the charm, but really Disney if you push the advertising and get little kids hopes up, follow through.

0312600844|2.0|I'll keep this short and sweet (or sour, in this case).  Oprah ought to read these books.  This is a overly long mess that has little redeeming value.  The characters are pathetic and the family traced in this book are typical of America today - a bunch of whiners with multiple personality disorders that couldn't hold my attention from chapter to chapter.  I read it on Kindle so I don't know how many pages it is, but it wasn't worth the effort and time.

B00005KHJR|5.0|West highland police officer Sergeant Howie (Edward Woodward) travels to a Scottish island where he is trying to find a missing 12 year old girl. There he meets the weird strange locals instead their leader Lord Sumerisle (Christopher Lee) where they probably know where she could be that is until he discovers their shocking secrets of their own religion where they sacrifice animals and people to their gods.<br /><br />Co-starring Ingrid Pitt and Britt Eckland, this is a brilliant and unique horror mystery thriller import from the UK that has gained critical acclaim and a cult following since then. Miss Eckland does a very sensual nude song sequence that arouses every guy, the performances are quite good even by Lee himself who is flawless as always. It really gives out clues and ideas to the viewers and of course a bleak ending that shows endings aren't always happy, i adored this movie since i was 16 and one of my fave UK horror movies.<br /><br />This 2-Disc DVD set has decent picture despite a few instances of grain and good quality sound on both theatrical and extended director's cut version with nice extras like interview, TV Spots, Trailer, radio spots and talent bios.
0446677450|2.0|I had to read this book for a personal finance class. Most of the book is written as a dialog between the author and the rich dad. Reading this got old fast and I kept thinking to myself.. \\"get to the point already!\\" The impression I got from the author is that he is arrogant as he seems to talk himself and \\"rich dad\\" up a lot. There are six lessons that are presented and I didn't feel that they were valuble or really practical to the everyday person - maybe if you are a real estate tycoon they would have value. Thankfully this book was cheap so I didn't waste too much money on it.

The ONLY interesting thing on this 90% unlistenable album is the early versions of \\"Factory\\" and \\"Racing in the Streets\\".  Save your $$, I wish I had saved mine.

0765326353|5.0|I was first exposed to Mr Sandersons work via the Mistborn series, and he's quickly become one of my favorite current authors.  Every one of his worlds feels incredibly rich and detailed, and every one almost seems to scream \\"RPG Setting\\" (either tabletop or video game).  Who wouldn't love to run a campaign set in Sanderson's huge and elaborate worlds?    Way of Kings looks to be the first of a new series that'll probably rival the Wheel of Time in scope and sheer number of pages.  Sanderson's still pretty young and producing a lot of material, so hopefully he won't go either the GRRM route (trolling the fans for years about book \\"4B\\") or die before finishing it like Jordan.  Then the next Sanderson will have to come along and finish that one.    The book is somewhat paint-by-the-numbers Sanderson.  The main hero has mysterious, magical powers that he uses to help overcome his status as a walking target for arrows carrying a bridge.  THere's a unique and complex magical system, which Sanderson only briefly delves into.  And there's huge, epic battles that remind me of anime in textual form.      Recommend this if you're a fan of epic fantasy and don't mind tackling a 1000-page monster.  It reads pretty fast despite its bulk, and this series definately has potential.

B004DI7HZ6|2.0|This book was promoted as one of the best books in February by Amazon so I pre-ordered it.   I will not do that again unless there are prior reviews.  While it started out somewhat interesting and had potential it was very sophomoric.  I could never feel any energy regarding the relationship between the Diana and Matthew, after the initial few meetings.  As other reviews have said it was long on commentary and very short on any action or suspense.  In the last quarter of the book they return to Dianna's home in the states and the story line becomes even looser.  The characters are not sympathetic and there are so many random ones that keep appearing that it is distracting.  It has all the hallmarks of a first book---hopefully the author will listen to a few critical reviews prior to the next in the series.  If not it may join the ranks of Twilight for the teen and pre-teen set.

There are too many people saying that they vote for the originals but are going ahead and giving it 5 stars anyway.

B004DI7HZ6|4.0|I cannot understand why people waste time complaing in the review section about pricing. If the price is too high simply do not make the purchase. A review should actually contain an opinion of the novel. Now on to the book itself. it is simply an amazing piece of work. I loved it and hope there is a second installment. The characters are complex and engaging. The twists and turns of the plot are nothing short of remarkable. This is one novel that simply begs to be read and then reread to catch any missing nuiances.
B0033QC0WE|5.0|There is and can be no \\"reference version\\" of Beethoven's symphonies. A range of interpretive approaches is possible, rather narrow in fact but made seemingly broad by our perception of the importance of this music. So we can choose from quasi-19th century Romantic approaches such as those of Jochum or Cluytens, or from still-massive but more precise and even \\"steely\\" versions such as Karajan's, or from lighter fleet-footed performances on period instruments, or at least in period style, that have become quite popular in recent years - for instance Zinman, Norrington, and Harnoncourt. To my ears, Gardiner's cycle is the finest among the last group.<br /><br />The reasons? I can add little to what has already been said, but would emphasize: (1) Fleet the music may be, but it is projected with an incredible passion and force. (2) This seems due not only to Gardiner's music conceptions but to the faultless, even brilliant, execution by the ORR. (3) The sound is excellent with a very substantial (but not tubby) low end, something that seems weak in certain other \\"period\\" versions. (4) In some places, Gardiner's approach makes quite a difference in how the music is heard. This can be welcome in pieces as familiar, or even overly-familiar, as these.<br /><br />The downside: As played here, this is music that grabs you by the throat and slams you up against the wall. The intensity of the experience is truly impressive, but do we really want this sort of experience as a steady diet? Well, that's one reason why there can't be a true \\"reference version,\\" and why Beethoven enthusiasts usually own several sets of symphonies. But for what it does and what it is, it's difficult to see this fine set being surpassed any time soon.<br /><br />Summary: I have heard no cycles, regardless of approach, that have the visceral impact of this one. If you love these symphonies and don't mind being assaulted in the finest Beethoven style, then run, don't walk.<br /><br />This set is still available in its full-priced version, so you may want to check out the many reviews there as well: [[ASIN:B0000057EO Beethoven: 9 Symphonies - Orchestre R&eacute;volutionnaire et Romantique / Gardiner]]sion, so you may want to check out the many reviews there as well: [[ASIN:B0000057EO Beethoven: 9 Symphonies - Orchestre Révolutionnaire et Romantique / Gardiner]]

B0018AK9RA|5.0|When this came out, I just said to myself: \\"Ok, another Priest album. I'll get it someday.\\"  But, I recently decided to check out the samples here, and, I just had to get it. Two words: HOLY CRAP! This is in a whole new league.<br />The songs are quite epic, due in no small part to the complex arrangements, keyboard and orchestral textures.<br />I've already seen several reviews from the usual closed-minded fans that want to hear the same album with a different name 20 times over. Thanks, but no thanks. Let's leave that to AC/DC and The Ramones I like them both, especially the latter. But, thankfully, not every band takes their approach. Otherwise, the world of music would be a lot more boring and repetitive than it already is.  If a band feels like changing their sound (as long as it's not in the direction of turning into super-commercial tripe), then they should be at the very least applauded for challenging themselves and trying something new.<br />Yes, there's perhaps one too many mellow songs, but that's a minor gripe.<br />Overall, this album is a magnificent masterpiece. I was getting chills down my spine as I listened. How can you not during Rob's ominously belting out of the \\"Gods of War\\" refrain, backed by such epic music? That's just one moment among many that made the hairs on my arm stand on end.<br />It's very sad that some Priest fans completely disregard this album, some literally pleading for a return to the SAME OLD formula. Please! Again, I don't need the same music over and over!<br />I always had Iron Maiden just a notch above Priest in my book, because IM tended to lean towards the more complex arrangements throughout their career. But Priest really outdid them with this one. I love them both, but this work is right up there with anything Maiden's ever done, if not better.<br />If you're a fan of metal, but not the bonehead simpleton kind, you'll definitely enjoy this.<br />This is a classic already, and should be revered as such. I can't possibly imagine this album not holding up many decades from now.<br />Ok, I'm running out of superlatives. JUDAS PRIEST RULES! Amen.ot holding up many decades from now.   Ok, I'm running out of superlatives. JUDAS PRIEST RULES! Amen.

B00003CXA6|5.0|I saw this shortly after it came to home video back in the 90s, and ever since it has remained one of my favorite war movies ever. The screenplay and acting are both excellent, and from everything I've heard they well represent the book on which it is based, [[ASIN:034540727X The Killer Angels]]. The movie does a great job of presenting the politics and philosophies of both sides, North and South, without passing judgment on either. It makes one realize that both armies had various complex reasons for fighting, only one of which was the issue of slavery. By thus humanizing both sides, it masterfully sets in contrast the tragedy of this battle (and indeed the entire war). The [[ASIN:B0000015H1 musical score]] by Randy Edelman is perfect for the movie and very well sets the emotional tone throughout the film.
0385341679|2.0|I had really enjoyed this series and had been waiting ever so patiently for this last(ish) installment.  Unfortunately, this book pretty much fell flat in almost every way.  I won't throw out any spoilers, but the author seemed to get desperate by the end.  It was obvious that she wanted to have a swerve, but she began throw random plot twists and enough red herrings to fill an entire river system.  None of it made any sense.  Like they said in \\"Silence of the Lambs,\\" it seemed desperately random.  There were disjointed leaps of 1st person perspective from one character to another, and most of the characters were fairly unlikable.  Throw that in with a finale that left it incredibly unclear as to whether or not this WAS the end of just kind of the end, and the whole read leaves you feeling rather unsatisfied.
B0001HLVS2|5.0|I found this movie to be superbly entertaining in a number of ways. It is much more of a drama than an action movie, although there is indeed plenty of action. It does a fantastic job of capturing the feel of a nineteenth-century naval ship (the dangers of the sea, the rigid social structure of Victorian English culture, sailors' superstition) and well develops the characters within this setting. The film explores several themes (such as duty, friendship, and courage) in compelling and thoughtful ways, avoiding cliche in favor of more complex undertakings. The cast did a great job in bringing the story to life, and I most of all enjoyed the performance of Paul Bettany, who plays the ship's surgeon and naturalist (a Darwin-like character).    I bought this version because I really liked the movie and wanted a cheap copy on DVD. It's fine if you just want the movie itself and don't care much about special features. If you strongly care about those, you'll probably want to invest in the [[ASIN:B0001DI0FI collector's edition]].
0061537969|4.0|I loved this book.  Denny Swift's dog, Enzo, narrates this story and gives us simple, touching and clear insights into love, misunderstanding, pain, and loss.  He cleverly tells a sad story and leaves the reader feeling alright about the very difficult job of saying goodbye to the people (and pets) we love.  Enzo is a true hero in the way he influences and communicates with Denny, Eve and his family.<br /><br />You don't have to know anything about driving a racecar or even be a NASCAR fan to enjoy the connection Stein makes between being a champion behind the wheel and taking charge of your own destiny.<br /><br />This is a fast read with a solid feel-good ending.

Ferriss has systematically tested (often on himself) most of the consensual wisdom of fat loss and muscle gain to weed out the flaws, and used a 'minimum effective dose' approach to everything. He has also created a fat loss diet which is based on healthy eating habits you can keep for life, and is both effective and easy to follow. If you buy one book for your body, buy this one. It's a perfect starting point whether you want to get leaner, or more muscular or just plain stronger.
B000YABYLA|5.0|This movie is simply awesome. It has a great combination of quirky humor and serious drama, which intertwine such that the mood never gets too silly or serious. Ellen Page plays her role superbly, easily slipping into the shoes of an unexpectedly pregnant teenage girl whose predicament forces her to discover who truly cares for her.
B0036TGSJ4|5.0|Generally I'm not into this type of movie but even I loved every second. Some scenes still make me laugh just thinking about it. It's an awesome show with an amazing cast and I couldn't recommend it more highly. The Blu-ray features are equally on par with the movie if you like watching such things. Buy it!
B00110K62U|5.0|I agree with the positive comments of other reviewers -- this is a top drawer performance by the cast, orchestra, and chorus. Sound and visual quality are excellent, not one single complaint. I view this Les Miserables dvd often, and will continue to enjoy it regularly.

B0043URV8M|3.0|Since when do you buy a cd and STILL have to download the cd!?!?!?!?  I was very unhappy with this feature.  It took 2 hours to download and I do NOT have dial up!  The music is awesome, but if you are buying a cd - you should expect to be able to put it in your cd player and play it!  3 stars but only for the hassle!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|What should I say? This item is just the best =)  For all Vampire Diaries fans it is the greatest thing in the world and I really like the booklet!    So, when I get the season I just lay down and watched it...I can't wait getting the next season =)
1601251505|5.0|I stopped playing D&D during 2E AD&D.  I recently came back to D&D with 4E but after the nostalgia wore off I decided I didn't really like it.  Mainly, I felt I had to put more effort into bringing RPG utility to the game.  Some friends of mine worship 3.5E but copies of those books have become very expensive.  When I heard that Pathfinder was basically 3.75E D&D I decided to buy the book.  In this one book you basically get the Player's Handbook and the DM Guide for around $35 new - you can't beat that!  I fell in love with it after DMing a 1-shot with my 4E group.  We all sold our 4E books and purchased Pathfinder products and we haven't looked back.  I am sure there are still many 3.5E problems in Pathfinder but since I skipped 3.5E and went to straight to Pathfinder I wasn't aware of them and to my knowledge I haven't seen them.  I am guessing they surface when min/maxing.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|I own three versions of Emma and find them all to be enjoyable to watch.  They all seem to be about the same except that this version is a little bit more in-depth.
1932100660|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a dear friend.  She said it would change my life and that was an understatement at least.  I have never been so mad, glad and perplexed by the same writing.  You will love this book and all the knowledge you gain will indeed change your life.  Wonderfully written and presented, the information in this book is so well documented that it is unquestioned.  Read and learn what is killing us and how to prevent that.  Plain and simple!
B0034G4P7G|2.0|The one I have has a screen size half the size of my TV/s.  I can't set the size of the screen of the DVD.  It doesn't work better on my own computer.  I liked the movie itself<br />when I saw it in the theatres.  Maybe I should have waited a little more longer for the DVD screen size to be adjustable or regular DVD size.  I know that Blu-Ray discs seem to be picking up a little, but that would cost more money to get the Blu-Ray version that can be viewed through a regular DVD player.  And it would cost more to get 2 wide screen/film aspect TVs.  On another note related, there's way too many commercials with regular TV, so it's not worth it ever to think of getting new widescreen TV/s. I would wait for a regular size screen view of the DVD of \\"Social Network.\\"  I'll check with Amazon about returning the copy I have.  I had a classmate in H.S. who went to Harvard, and I knew a lady who plays violin in NYC where I lived for 11 years also.
B002ZG994U|4.0|The original A-team is best, but this movie was quite good, just not as good as watching the original guys do there thing.  We liked the movie and thought it was quite good.  Not a great movie, but a very good movie.  Plenty of action, lots of stuff getting blown up.  Some of the new characters suffered in their roles as they are not anywhere as good as the original A-team series actors.
B0042RJWTC|5.0|Very interesting story. Not perfect in its historical facts but I did recognize a lot from my history studies in school. Much better image of Henry VIII. I would hope the producers are going to continue with young Edward and the ladies Elizabeth and Mary.
B000JQV68A|1.0|This is the most boring book I have ever read.  Fitzgerald babbles and his characters are lifeless and dull.  Don't waste your time.
B003FVI2KQ|5.0|This processor is fast and the fan it comes with is quiet. It is truly a quiet pc when making other good decisions to build something beasty and not loud. Worth the money!
0385528752|5.0|The framework presented to affect change is simple yet complete.  The perspectives are equally valuable whether trying to affect change in a business situation or personally.
B000PDYVVG|3.0|I cannot believe all the hullabaloo about this book. The angry reviews. I gave it three stars. I wasn't expecting anything from this book. It's different for me, and I just wanted to see what it was all about. I think the concept is very interesting. I also am not judging this woman. I don't feel that she's trying to make herself out to be anything, as some reviews have suggested. I think it's an honest account of a year in her life. And I can applaud her honesty, I loved her wittiness and her general \\"energy\\". But... I'm not quite through with Italy and I'm bored. She rambles, on and on about things that have nothing to do with what she was talking about two sentences ago and goes on for pages, before finally wandering back to her original point, by which time I have forgotten what on earth she was even talking about. The chapters are oddly placed, sometimes dead in the middle of something that's happening, and I found it really disconcerting, yanked me right out of the book. But mostly, I'm having trouble slogging through this one. There just is nothing happening. That being said, I do find that I AM thoroughly enjoying her descriptions of the country and its people. I have always wanted to travel, and so, I get to see Italy (and eventually India and Indonesia), and she gives lovely vivid descriptions. But did I mention I'm bored to tears? I want *something* to happen. The beginning hooked me. I couldn't stop reading the sample chapters. There was so much happening. So I bought the book, and it seems to have come to a dead stop. Somebody please tell me it picks up? I will read it. It's not a bad book. Worth the read. But I'm slogging through it.
B0037KMHRY|5.0|This is really cool stuff!  The 22 tracks, done in classical orchestra backing with the electronica of Daft Punk give a powerful fullness to the music, somewhat similar to the volumous magic of the Star Wars instrumentation and effect, only better!  It gives you a feeling of magnitude, as if you were sometimes floating in space, looking down on planet Earth.  The synthesization is magnificent.  It is a futuristic-type score that is often heart-thumping and driving.<br /><br />As much as I love music, I was so \\"into\\" the movie when I saw it in the theater, I was not even consciously aware of the music.  Now that I listen to it separately, I wonder why not.  Obviously, the music and film were perfectly blended.  In other words, I was affected by the music without even realizing it.<br /><br />This is not party music, but something you would play while you are either consciously relaxing and listening to it, or going about your business in the house (cleaning, in your workshop, whatever).  Sometimes it's slow and spacey; sometimes it is driving and thumping. The booming base is awesome.  If you play it in the car, don't blame me if you get a speeding ticket!  It makes you feel kind of invincible--and it makes you want to watch the movie again!<br /><br />BTW, the CD looks like the disc they wear in the movie, and the album cover looks like it lights up!
B0000A1258|5.0|Very good this first album recorded entirely in English by Laura Pausini. The tracks are worth mentioning: Surrender, I Need Love, Every Day Is A Monday (Il Mio Piu Grande Sbaglio) and It's Not Good-Bye (In Assenza Di Te). This Japanese edition, comes with four bonus tracks: Surrender (Ford's Remix), Surrender (Toronto Chilled Mix), Il Mio Sbaglio Piu Grande and In Assenza Di Te. Suitable for all who enjoy the voice of Laura Pausini, especially enriched this edition with two tracks and two remixes in Italian. It is worth checking!
0671027344|5.0|I found out about this book less than a month ago I was scrolling on tumblr and saw someone post a quote from this book. At this point I can't even remember what exactly it said but I remember it touched me , made me think. I googled quotes from this book and every single one had me touched , every single one made since, it just was amazing I fell in love with the book before I even read it. I decided I was going to buy this book , plans got cancelled and that got put off hold. One day I was in my school library and decided to look for it, when I found it I got it on a Thursday and today's Sunday and I've finished the entire book. Keep in mind I'm a 17 year old girl with a busy schedule so I truly was in love to finish it that fast.<br /><br />Honestly I don't think you truly get it without reading the quotes or the whole entire book. In a nutshell this book is about Charlie a high school freshman who writes diary like entries to an unknown person. He's getting over the death of his aunt and the fact that his best friend committed suicide. I told my friends that this book was like a philosophy book written by a 15 year old. That's the best way I can explain it. It's truly amazing , I plan on buying this book and letting my children read it - I could read this book literally a million times and never get tired. IT is just brilliant. It makes you think a lot about life , one quote<br /><br />\\"I walk around the school hallways and look at the people. I look at the teachers and wonder why they're here. If they like their jobs. Or us. And I wonder how smart they were when they were fifteen. Not in a mean way. In a curious way. It's like looking at all the students and wondering who's had their heart broken that day, and how they are able to cope with having three quizzes and a book report due on top of that. Or wondering who did the heart breaking. And wondering why.\\"<br /><br />that just really will leave an imprint. It's just a book that makes you think , I really can't explain it better. It is amazing and I recommend it to anyone trying to get through something anything. I think every single struggle is talked about death, drugs, alcohol, sex,music,school,thoughts - insanity. EVERYTHING. I wish I could truly explain how amazing this is but I can't its impossible you just have to read it for yourself. I promise you will not regret it  -this book changed my life.tter.

0439023521|4.0|I just finished reading this book and found it very entertaining and fast-paced.  There were a few slow parts where nothing was happening that I skimmed over, but overall, this book is a very quick read.  Although the characters are all young, I do think that adults will enjoy this book as well. I just wonder how in the world they are going to kill off children/teenagers in the movie version without ruining the story and action sequences!!  I look forward to reading the second book to see how things continue.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I have always been a big Bruce Willis fan, and Morgan Freeman is my favorite actor, so it makes since that this movie would be a hit for me. There are a couple of parts where I get so involved and excited that I sit up and want to join in the fun. It's funny and full of action. What more could you want!?!
0525951652|4.0|Absolutely adored \\"Pillars\\" and \\"World Without End.\\"  \\"Giants\\" is almost as good.  Love the way the author weaves his fantastic research into such an entertaining, gripping story!  Anxious to read the rest of the trilogy.
B000002KCV|5.0|I have this music on an album, love it. I love it even more now that I can play the CD in my car.
0385341679|4.0|After a full year of waiting, Shadowfever is here. I read it in less than 24 hours. I could NOT put it down. However I still had a million and one questions. I don't want to put them in this review incase you (a purcahser) have not read the book. I honestly felt that this was like this was a semi orgasmic experience. I had a great ride however the final big O never came. I feel that Karen did a great job. The story was engrossing, I was caught up in Mac and Barrons appearent lust for one another. Mac becoming who she is meant to be.Barrons story. The deception by 2 people she came to trust. But the ending pissed me off. It left too many old questions open and now some new ones. I am excited in thinking she may have a new series come out however I felt like this was a big gotcha to the reader. I did enjoy the book, Kaern is a phenominal writer. That is why I wrote a review. However I believe that whomever purchase this book needs to know the truth and not expect it to be completed in this book
B0001HAISG|5.0|A great movie in every aspect: great directing, amazing special effects, wonderful acting, good script, music, amazing sets and costumes and flying sequences that put the Superman films to shame. This is probably one of if not the best adaptation of J. M. Barrie classic children's story. I think the director and producers tried to put on it as much of the book as possible, since it is very long (almost 2 hours), as Peter Jackson did in Lord Of The Rings.<br /><br />This a wonderful family movie, much better than Disney's animated version of the tale. And perhaps because it was made in Australia with British cast and director aren't very well known it didn't sit well with American audiences.  There are no sing-song sequences. Some scenes may be a little intense for the very little ones,like swordfights and the crocodile, there is a little romance between Peter and Wendy as well, but is very cute and completely innocent. The story is very well brought to life and you'll never find a dull moment.<br />The DVD has lots of bonus materials with in depth look at behind the scenes and other features. My only complaint is that you cannot skip or foward the previews in order to get to the main movie.<br />I give it 5 stars, worthy of having in your collection of family films adapted from books.
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I had never purchased used DVD's before, but there is no difference as far as I am concerned. It viewed just fine, I'm very happy, thanks.
B001GWK2MC|4.0|Contacted seller via phone just after the new year for this purchase made at Christmas for my daughter and was instructed to send email from amazon.com link to receive a RA# for the return. Well another month has past and no response. Everytime I call the number listed the mailbox is full and no one ever answers the phone. I attempted another email today, we'll see what happens.
0307454541|4.0|With thousands of reviews for this book, The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo, it's all been said.<br /><br />Literally.<br /><br />Journalist Mikael Blomkvist teams up with mysterious free-lance investigator and hacker Lisbeth Salander to find out who killed Harriet Vanger, whose uncle wants no make sure no stone is left unturned with Harriet's disappearance decades ago.<br /><br />It's a grisly tale.<br /><br />But here's the trick.  The movie version follows the plot of the book so completely, that there is no mystery when reading the book (when you already watched the movie) except for being inside the mind of Lisbeth Salander.  And it's such a thrilling story, that it's bothersome that you know exactly what's going to happen.<br /><br />So here's my recommendation.  Read the book first.  Let it build slowly in suspense, as it will.  Then, with that reading under your belt, go see the [[ASIN:B003FBNJ4U movie]].  I guarantee that you will be blown away with the intensity of the action, and the acting of Noomi Rapace as Salander.  That way, you'll get the full entertainment value from both the book and the movie.
0810979772|5.0|Again, ditto to my 1st msg on previous book. This is now a 10yr old's collective item he will keep for years and pass down to his children.
B00333NCTM|4.0|I am kinda of a calm teenage guy, and I really like this book.  It's an unusual pick for me, perhaps, but I do not regret getting it.  It is written well and it includes both vulgar and touching moments.  Good job, Ozzy!
B000ZM1MG4|5.0|This purchase was made to replace my VHS tape of the movie Tootsie.  I have enjoyed seeing this movie over and over.  Dustin Hoffman is just hysterical in his portrayal of a female soap star from his audition to the end.  A must see movie.
B000PWQPAC|5.0|I have been a big fan of the GITS anime and always felt 2 seasons were not enough. It ended with some questions. GTIS Solid State Society answered those questions. You do need to see the 2 seasons of GITS prior to seeing this. Music still done by Yoko Kanno & Origa. Extremely recommended.
B0047685I2|5.0|I fell in love with this movie from the the beginning with the movie trailer!  It looked spectacular and did not disappoint.  I have owned the VHS and DVD recording and never tire of viewing the film.  The story of Cinderella is told in such a believable way - did this really happen?  Drew Barrymore and Dougray Scott are outstanding in their portrayal of Cinderella and the Prince. Ever since Blu-ray came into being I have looked for this movie's release in Blu-ray format.  The scenery in the film is beautiful and I just knew it would be great in the high definition format.  Finally it is here!  I purchased it on the release date and yes, it is beautiful in Blu-ray.  If you have not seen this film, it is a must see.  What an incredible update of an old Fairy Tale.
B000I0QL82|4.0|Bought as a gift for my Sister-in-law as she used to watch this movie with her mom every Christmas before she passed.  Great delivery and it was nice to find it and be able to give her something that meant so much to her!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love young adult/teen fiction and this book was wonderful. The characters are well written and many of my favorites from the first book were back.  A wonderful book in it's own right, it also does a wonderful job of bridging the gap between the Hunger Games and Mockingjay.<br /><br />When I started the Hunger Games I was unprepared for the way the story grabbed me, but I was hooked. Catching Fire deepened my interest in the characters and deepened my desire to learn what lies in store for Katniss.<br /><br />I'm grateful I can get Mockingjay onKindle and start reading right away.
B0040ZA2D6|5.0|Bought for my sons who love the TV show and now can listen to the music when they like.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|RED is one of those movies that is so exceedingly rare these days: an action comedy with no grand ambitions, no desire other than to entertain the socks right off your feet.  At this, the film excels spectacularly.  It concerns the retired (extremely dangerous) CIA agent Frank Moses, who one night finds a hit squad in his house.  Determined to track down who's behind the attempted hit, Moses rounds up some old friends, and together they decide to take on the CIA and potentially the entire US government.  Sound like a good time?  You bet it is!<br /><br />Without the spectacular cast (all of whom are delightfully hamming it up), the film would still be enjoyable.  With this cast, it borders on one of the best action comedies of recent years.  Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, Helen Mirren, and John Malkovich are all top-notch as retired agents with a little bite left in them.  Joining them for the ride is a delightfully cool and sinister Karl Urban, as the man pursuing Moses; Marie-Louise Parker, charming and hilarious, as Moses's love interest; Brian Cox as a former Russian spy; Ernest Borgnine as a records keeper; and Richard Dreyfus as a shady businessman.<br /><br />The characters are two dimensional, and the plot is shallow and convoluted.  Various plot holes aren't resolved, and the trailers gave away a lot of great moments plot details (though don't worry, there are still plenty of others).  These may seem like minor things in an action movie, but in a film with this great a cast, you notice them.  That's the only reason RED gets 4 instead of 5 stars.  Otherwise, it is an upbeat, fun, funny action film, one of those rare pieces of popcorn entertainment that warrants repeated viewing.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This season was highly recommended by a friend. Purchased season 1 through amazon.com, watched all episodes back to back. Immediately following, we purchased season 2 & 3 over amazon.com instant play and my husband and I watched 20 episodes back to back over the weekend... we literally couldn't STOP! Exceptional drama; gripping, intelligent,highly suspenseful and addicting to watch! So many, \\"HOLY COW - did that really just happen??\\" moments.  We are astonished that we have never heard about this series before.  Highly recommended.
0452286751|5.0|\\"Howard Roark laughed.\\"    The infamous first line of The Fountainhead. A lot of people disliked it. Very few enjoy it. An even smaller amount understand it by the time they close the book on the last page.    There are a lot of reviews stating that this book has too much 'garbled' dialogue, or just too much dialogue altogether. This is not so. There are a lot of words, but each word is carefully chosen and placed. There is not a wasted letter in this entire book. It's long because it needs to be, otherwise it would be nothing.    This book, overall, is simple. It's written quite simply, with only a few large words thrown in on behalf of Mr. Ellsworth M. Toohey.  But the careful and considerate reader would know that one has to read between the lines with this book. As Toohey put (rather plainly not too far into it), what he states is often just chat; within his column there is ever only one gem of a statement made.  The rest of it is drowned out. It's pretty obvious that this is why there is so much dialogue. Rand provides sentence after sentence clarifying everything. It can be confusing if you're only just racing through the book to say you've read it. But to really get it, you have to think about it too.    The way Rand wrote this was beautifully done. If you'd rather read a vapid romance novel, no one will stop you. But if you want to read something with depth, actual character development, a plot, and walk away from a book having learned something, The Fountainhead is a pretty good start. Most people think it's just some tripe teenagers pick up to be rebellious. While I'm not a big fan of Objectivism itself, I have to say I am incredibly impressed with Rand's writing. I was when I was 14 and picked this book up for the first time and I am now, at 22, still picking it up to read it to redeem my faith in humanity after laying eyes on a bad book.    What I've always appreciated about The Fountainhead were its characters. I love the dialogue. It's witty and it requires at least a semblance of brainpower to truly understand what is happening. I can always picture the characters interacting while giving these long speeches and speaking in the indifferent, choppy ways that they do, picking up conversations that never started. If you pay attention you will always know what is going on. Rand does not baby her readers; she pushes them into the lake and says, \\"Swim.\\" If a reader can't appreciate a writer like that then they should stick to books like Twilight where they won't require to comprehend a thing and just focus on getting to the naughty bits.    The relationships between the characters are more than your usual pow-wow in books. They are soul-deep. Steve Mallory, Roark, Dominique, Toohey, Keating, even Heller all play such key roles in each other's lives, it's amazing. Without such terrific characters this book would be nothing. A lot of people seem to think they are all the same, but it simply isn't true. They share some of the same qualities, but they are so unique to each other that they complement each other quite well. This especially between Dominique and Roark.    Howard Roark is probably one of the best characters I've read about. A lot of people take issue with the fact that his buildings are described as simple and perfect in their simplicity, and yet Rand enjoys going on and on and on about other things. I will say, it is done for a reason. If you can't figure that reason out then this book is too advanced for you.    There are many more things to discuss in this book. But needless to say, it's a worthwhile read despite the lengthy dialogue. You will walk away having learnt something and you will appreciate it.
B004NIUUNC|5.0|This book is for anyone seriously wanting to make a change in their life. A basic how to handbook on how to go about it successfully.  Rated a top five book by some of the leading Leadership gurus in America. Easy reading.
B002P5XXR0|4.0|I loved the movie and the music associated with it.  The CD has most of the good stuff on it but lacks the end credits.  I realize the end credits were just repeats of what was in the movie, but hearing it again would have been nice.

B002ZG981E|3.0|The genius of INCEPTION is elevating the traditional caper film to a mind-bending sci-fi epic, at the core of which is a novel concept: invading people's dreams. But where it falls short, in my opinion, is the director's evident lack of restraint and the amateurish execution of the plot.<br /><br />Director Christopher Nolan said he spent the better part of 10 years writing the script for INCEPTION. That's not surprising, considering there are about 10 years' worth of ideas in the film, some of which probably should have been cut in subsequent drafts. An editor not intimidated by Nolan's recent track record, and who's not immersed in the writing, should have been able to point out the inconsistencies in the characters' behaviors and motivations, as well as the roles sheer luck and happenstance played in the successes and failures of a mission that's supposed to turn on a dime. But, because that did not happen, the viewer is bombarded with rushed sequences in which the characters make snap judgments that make little to no sense, because, as it turns out, they were juggling far more things in their heads than you thought they were.<br /><br />Just one example, without spoiling too much for those of you who haven't seen the movie yet. The mission hinges on Fisher, the target, accepting that his godfather is scheming against him. This crucial turning point passes on the screen with little fanfare in about 30 seconds. Anyway, what informs this suspicion? Why, merely the fact that Fisher and someone posing as his godfather--don't ask--were kidnapped together, combined with the furtive suggestions of the hero, Cobb. There are but two explanations to this astounding leap in Fischer's subconscious: 1) He already suspected his godfather, thus rendering the plot's complex orchestrations pointless; or 2) Cobb is a preternatural genius, rendering him absurd. Either way, it's not looking good for the movie's final assessment.<br /><br />The \\"science\\" of dream sharing necessarily has to be exposited to the viewer--or, better yet, shown. The complex structural rules of this fictional universe are satisfying enough...but Nolan doesn't stop there; what good is a rule if you don't break it? Ordinarily there are three ways to exit a shared dream: death, \\"kick,\\" or simply waking up. However, for the mission that occupies the bulk of the plot, those rules do not apply: because of the strength of the sedatives the team uses, a simple \\"kick\\" from above won't pull them out; they need a synchronized kick, one from above and one where they are at. Also, if they die in the dream, they drop into limbo. What's so bad about limbo? Well, in limbo you lose your grasp on reality, and your brain turns to scrambled egg, according to one character. Fortunately limbo is not permanent: To leave, all you have to do is kill yourself. Given the supposed confusion of reality and dream inherent in limbo, that's easier said than done.<br /><br />Got all that? Sounds impossible to pull off, doesn't it? No worries, though. Despite Cobb's \\"bursting\\" subconscious, he can leave limbo with ease, and does so twice! And, when it's crunch time, supporting characters Yusuf, Arthur, and Eames prove themselves as capable as the Navy S.E.A.L.s in subduing the bad guys and completing their assigned tasks in as short amount a time as humanly--or, should I say, inhumanly--possible. As for those synchronized kicks, after some clever film editing, they come together like the layers of a double-decker BLT.<br /><br />So what was the big deal at the outset? Shush, you're not supposed to ask.he viewer--or, better yet, shown. The complex structural rules of this fictional universe are satisfying enough...but Nolan doesn't stop there; what good is a rule if you don't break it? Ordinarily there are three ways to exit a shared dream: death, \\"kick,\\" or simply waking up.

Fortunately limbo is not permanent: To leave, all you have to do is kill yourself. Given the supposed confusion of reality and dream inherent in limbo, that's easier said than done.    Got all that? Sounds impossible to pull off, doesn't it? No worries, though. Despite Cobb's \\"bursting\\" subconscious, he can leave limbo with ease, and does so twice! And, when it's crunch time, supporting characters Yusuf, Arthur, and Eames prove themselves as capable as the Navy S.E.A.L.s in subduing the bad guys and completing their assigned tasks in as short amount a time as humanly--or, should I say, inhumanly--possible. As for those synchronized kicks, after some clever film editing, they come together like the layers of a double-decker BLT.    So what was the big deal at the outset? Shush, you're not supposed to ask.
0307474712|3.0|Starts off as an interesting commentary on human relationships. There are some funny moments. However Dex is an increasingly unlikeable character, which makes it difficult to root for the relationship. Worse, the last 20% of the book is pointless and maudlin, which was the final nail in the coffin for me.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|Its been awhile since I had a really GOOD set of studio, noise canceling headphones.  With \\"portable\\" digital media being so prevalent, earbuds are de rigor.<br /><br />But after a day with the Sony 7506s the earbuds are going back into the drawer. \\"The difference between night and day\\" is pretty trite so I'll give a music analogy.  The difference between karaoke and singing on stage with Led Zeppelin!<br /><br />If you love music, even if you just a casual listener as I am these days, treat yourself to great sound that gives you ALL of your music.<br /><br />The only reason I gave a star down on comfort by the way, is studio earphones and long hair don't always work well together.

B000FA5QEK|4.0|I had heard a lot of bad press about this book long before I ever read it, and therefore I came to it with a pretty strong bias.  First off, the book, in my opinion, is a series of somewhat fictionalized stories gathered from the authors young and perhaps largely his imagination.  I have used the thoughts found here to reduce my over all debt and to think outside of the box.  I don't find anything mythical, transcendant advice here, but some good stories that make you think, the way multiple streams of income does.  I haven't gotten rich from the book just yet, but am definitely a lot further out of debt, and making money in far more inventive ways than before I read it.  I would suggest, if you have not read the book, that you read it with an open mind, but also a grain of salt, and see if the ideas might be fitted into your own life and financial situation thereby.<br /><br />Paul Buckner, author of : Broke To Broker: Stories of Finding Financial Freedom and \\"Gabriel Jennings and The Ferret Freedom Fighters.\\"

1401307787|5.0|I picked this book up because I found such a great price on it. I never dreamed it would influence me so much. The book is about mindfulness, living fully in the moment without judgment, and how to cultivate it. It consists of a series of short and highly readable chapters with insights about mindfulness, and mindfulness exercises periodically thrown in. Even though the book's concepts are largely based on Eastern philosophy, Kabat-Zinn presents the material in a way that this Westerner could appreciate and understand. He regularly references and quotes Western authors (such as Thoreau), and does not employ many Eastern technical terms. Because of this, I didn't really view the book as a religious text, but rather as a book about focusing one's mind and life in a helpful way for greater wellness.<br /><br />One basic technique that Kabat-Zinn teaches is to focus on one's breath as a way to live in the moment, which is advice given in many meditation books. Another technique involves sitting in a way that is dignified. There are many more. The techniques are not fancy or difficult, but mindfulness is not difficult to comprehend, even if it can be challenging to master.<br /><br />At first, being mindful for even a few seconds is difficult, but it gets easier with time, especially since the results are very rewarding. I find that when I am mindful, I become more relaxed and open. I notice things I wouldn't have otherwise noticed (such as details on the wall I am facing). When I was hiking outside on a winter day, I used some of the techniques, and I suddenly noticed rich details all around me: birds singing, the wind blowing, and the red and brown colors of nature became so vibrant to my mind that I still vividly recall the image months later. I also find that my worries about the future vanish and my sense of time seems to change. Just reading the book has changed my perspective, and made me realize how much the past and future control my life, and how very little I actually appreciate the present.<br /><br />This book is not about learning to be passive or how to follow your every desire (as \\"living in the moment\\" can often mean in popular usage). Living in the moment is about fully being aware of the present and being in a relaxed focus. The book is not a \\"how-to\\" textbook in the Western sense, but, if you read the whole book, and use the exercises, you will learn and experience what it means to be mindful.<br /><br />Overall, I really enjoyed this book. The book's techniques and philosophy not only help me put life in perspective, but have allowed me to appreciate \\"the moment\\" more. I am amazed how many people (including myself) are controlled by their past and future, but fail to adequately live in the only time they can really live: the present. Living mindfully transforms normal, seemingly mundane experiences, into meaningful moments, and opens up possibilities in every situation.ate the present.

B0034G4P7G|3.0|This movie was ok but very slow moving with too much technical language spoken too fast. I felt I needed a degree in computer tech just to watch the film because it jumped around a lot. Towards the last half hour it made me fall asleep. Of course I will need to watch this several more times to get through it all and make sense of it other than the cheating and backstabbing of the characters.  I recommend that anyone interested in seeing this movie should RENT IT FIRST to see if you can get through it before purchasing. Otherwise it is a great film for the insomniac, guaranteed to catch you up on lost sleep. The acting was well done and I understand why it was up for so many awards and the plot was good but was lost on anyone without a degree.  I was looking forward to seeing this movie as a facebook user but the politics and legal issues were too much in focus. It did explain why there are constantly problems with Facebook...GREED!!! They are always adding new stuff so you can't keep up especially with the games but should focus on fixing problems that arise before adding new items, but they don't. This was a great idea to connect people and is great when it works properly and should be fun as intended, not frustrating as it usually is. Fix facebook now and you will get more users, I know many people who quit using it because it was getting to be more like work than fun.

B003HARV3Y|5.0|This movie was well done and very entertaining. It brings the subject of Mythology to an updated language that is interesting to the young. I saw this then The Clash Of The Titans and this was a good setup and true to the mythology. The old stuff could be hard to read or watch in the old English, but in the way this was done it made me wanting more. I hope the studios are planning on a sequel because it was both entertaining and educational and I believe has opened the eyes of many young people. I first saw this movie on cable and found myself watching it every time it was on and saw something new each time. Since purchasing, I have watched it several more times and can't get tired of this film. Great Job with this movie and I recommend it for kids from 8 to 80, and hope to see more studios making interesting movies like this one.
0545265355|5.0|I bought this for my 11 year old daughter, per her request. She has loved Harry Potter, the Gregor series by this author, and Percy Jackson.  I was very tentative about the horrific subject matter, but I read the first one myself and felt that the writing style was relatable without being terrifying.  The other fantasy books had similar dark themes so ultimately I thought this was OK. She LOVED the books, and told me she was trying to read them slowly because she was enjoying them so much.  But I won't let my 9 year old read this!
0140157352|5.0|Not a scholarly book but has lots of good stuff in there that you can apply in many areas of your life.  Fast read.  It was great but would have been even better if it had more business examples in it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I just finished this book and I can honestly say that it is one of the best i've ever read! It's very hard to put this one down, and it has its highs and lows right to the very last page. Have the tissues close because this book takes you on an emotional rollercoaster. I THOROUGHLY enjoyed it!
B004DK5CW4|3.0|I must be getting old, because after I watched \\"Secretariat\\" my immediate thought was: \\"This would be a great film to watch with (fill in the name of various nieces, nephews, young cousins, children of friends).\\"<br /><br />I think the movie does a pretty good job of being a wholesome family film, with an \\"attack your goals, strive for greatness, don't fear a challenge\\" theme, and manages to be entertaining while doing so.  Diane Lane, who looks absolutely gorgeous, does a great job.  She's completely committed to the role and the movie, and never once does she fold under the hokey dialogue they put in her mouth.  I also loved seeing Nelsan Ellis (who plays Lafayette on \\"True Blood\\") playing a role as low-key as his regular role is flamboyant.<br /><br />Randall Wallace does his best to put you in the jockey's seat during the horse races.  We see bucking point of view shots and the world shakes with the thundering of horse hooves.  Mike Rich, who also wrote the brilliant sports movie \\"The Rookie,\\" doesn't quite do as good of a job.  It cannot be underestimated how huge the Secretariat story was.  I think the script does an underwhelming job of showing you just how seismic its impact was.  And going into the final race, with a dominating horse with the chance to win the Triple Crown, the movie doesn't express the excitement and national intrigue.  They toss off the knowledge that the horse was featured on the cover of \\"Time\\" magazine in a single line of dialogue.<br /><br />So it's not a perfect movie, and not the place to look if you want the facts of Secretariat's run to history, but it's a nice little film to watch with your kids.  I'm sure that's what Disney was aiming for, though I do think they could have created something even better.
0385341679|5.0|I started reading the Fever series a few weeks ago, and I just finished Shadowfever last night. I definitely recommend reading them back-to-back, because each book ends in a cliffhanger, and presents a trillion questions you desperately want answered.<br />These books are unlike anything I've ever read, and they are deeply engrossing.<br />If you want to escape reality for a bit, these are the books for you.<br />You will not be able to put them down (so do your laundry and stock up the fridge before you start reading).<br />I gave this series five stars, because I do love the books.<br />They put me out of my comfort zone, and expanded my box.<br />That doesn't mean, I don't have a few bones to pick...see below.<br /><br />*SPOILERS*<br />By the time I made it to Shadowfever, I felt like I was going to explode if I didn't get a few things answered fairly soon.<br />After it turned out that the monster was Barrons, I just thought 'enough already'.<br />So, I skipped to the end, read the last page, blew off some steam, and continued reading.<br />All of Mac's internal dialogue was starting to get to me. After four books, you'd think she had her identity crisis resolved.<br />I love Moning's writing style, but I think she should have focused more on meaningful dialogue rather than Mac's epic, internal monologues.<br />I think what is most frustrating is the fact it took 4.9 books to finally get to the information that is important to the reader.<br />And the last few chapters were very short with little dialogue (compared to the other chapters).<br />For example, Barrons spends thousands of years hunting for the book so he can lay his son to rest. This was the driving force behind his character and created the dynamic between Mac and him, and Moning spends one sentence on this event!!! \\"He buried his son...\\"<br />Also, throughout the book, Barrons knew everything, always one step ahead.<br />So, how did he not know that K'Vruck could have ended his son's suffering?!<br />And, how did he not know that Isla was pregnant that night?<br />Remember the chapter, where Barrons tells Mac he can smell everything, and the only blood he smells is in her womb.<br />So, that didn't really make sense to me!<br />He is portrayed as all-knowing, yet doesn't know the obvious.<br />Did anyone else feel that way???<br /><br />The fact that the walls are still down, is an acceptable part of the ending.<br />I think it would have been unrealistic to cram that event in at the end as well.<br /><br />This book is definitely not appropriate for a younger audience.<br />I think Moning needs to lay off the romance novels, lol.<br />Either you like all the graphic detail, or you don't.<br /><br />A few things bothered me, that were open-ended.<br />What favor did Rhyodan want to ask Dani?<br />I don't think that was answered.<br />Also, I wonder if the favors (deals with the devil) Mac owes to the Unseelie King and the Gray Woman will be part of the spin-off series.<br /><br />Your thoughts and comments are welcome!
B003UESJDS|2.0|When one is laid up sick in bed for several days, what does one do?  I watch movies. So a movie based on a graphic novel.  The original story was first serialized in the UK newspaper The Guardian starting in 2005 and is a modern retelling of the Thomas Hardy novel Far From the Madding Crowd. In fact Hardy gets quite a bit of discussion at times in the film.    I have never read the comic (it has been collected into hard and soft back editions) but was drawn to the film by the cast and a clear and freely admitted bias on my part to give movies from the comics field every chance to win me over.  I WANTED to like this film.  Really.  I like Gemma Arterton (Clash of the Titans)playing the title character and am a fan of Roger Allam (known to comic-to-movie fans as Lewis Prothero from the V for Vendetta film).  And I have been a huge fan of Tamsin Greig for years.  She brings elegance to everything she does on film.  In a few years, her name will be mentioned easily alongside Helen Mirren and Judi Dench.    With the cast making me interested, the Director sealed the deal.  Stphen Frears (The Queen) is as good as they come.  And so, with all these things going for it, I was expecting something at least enjoyable.  That was not to be.  There are many things to enjoy here, and I will get to those in a bit.  The bottom line with this is that I simply didn't find anything in it to feel good about.  Not all films are feel good experiences, nor should they be, (Trainspotting anyone?) but when you go in expecting Rom-Com and get downright depressing, that's just a bummer for everyone.  I have not ready the original Hardy novel for better than 20 years and cannot claim to be a fan or an expert, but it is clear that the things that work in print do not always translate well to film.  The source medium dictates in significant ways, the manner that the audience perceives what they are seeing.  In print the human mind brings its own sense of closure to fill in the inevitable gaps ina narrative that cannot be expressed verbally or, in the case of a comic, even visually in static images.  This is much like 10 people looking at a great work or \\"ART\\" and coming away with 10 different experiences.  We each bring ourselves to the event and color it with our own palette.  Film is not as much a slave to the audience.  At least not modern cineplex fare.  We as an audience are rarely asked to step outside of our comfort zone and bring anything of ourselves to the experience, rather it is expected that the film will just wash over us and entertain.  I think that is the essential gap here.  The subtleties of print are different from those of film and are not always compatible.  The result here is no characters that are even a little bit likeable save for the Tamsin Greig character, and even she is more an object of pity than real admiration.    OK.  Enough of the negative.  There are some very nice things here.  The look of the film as fantastic.  If, after watching this movie, you don't have a need to spend time in the countryside, then you are broken.  Gemma Arterton is very good as an ultimately unlikable and even shallow lead, while the rest of the cast does equally well.  There is really nothing wrong with this film, provided you are its target audience.  I clearly am not in that group. There is not a bad performance here and the script works well given that the film ultimately just seems mean-spirited, but hides it in pretty things.    I do believe there is an audience out there for this film that failed to see it in the theater.  Hopefully the people out there that will enjoy this movie make the effort to search it out on the just released Blu-ray or DVD, as I feel it deserves to reach a greater audience than it has.

B0041KKYEM|5.0|BLACK SWAN is a clinical examination of psychosis vs borderline personality dichotomy and as such it succeeds well.  It is not unusual for director Darren Aronofsky to plunge into controversial subject matter ('Requiem for a Dream', 'The Wrestler', 'Pi', 'The Fountain') but his mastery of a new zone of cinematic investigation of mental illness based on a story by Andr&eacute;s Heinz who also wrote the screenplay with Mark Heyman and John McLaughlin is his most daring work yet. BLACK SWAN is as disturbing a film to watch as it is a richly rewarding testament to storytelling based on age-old themes.<br /><br />The setting is a ballet company preparing a new version of the familiar Petipa and Ivanov choreography of the ballet Swan Lake, a story based on Russian folktales about a young girl transformed into a white swan ('Odette') and the darker malevolent black swan ('Odile') who under spells from the evil Rothbart vie for the love of Prince Siegfried.  The choreographer Thomas (Vincent Cassel) must retire the reigning white swan queen (Winona Ryder) because of her age and has tryouts for a new swan queen.  The shy, introverted, frightened but excellent dancer Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman) seems perfect for Thomas' new concept of the white swan, but she lacks the visceral and sensual passion for the extension of the role as the black swan.  Nina is the daughter of a frustrated ex-ballerina Erica Sayers (Barbara Hershey) who gave birth to Nina and missed out on becoming a prima ballerina.  Erica is controlling and forces Nina into rigorous training and discipline so that Nina will become the star Erica failed to realize.  Nina devotes her life to ballet, participates in behaviors such as self mutilation that suggest she is an unstable personality.  Thomas continues to attempt to bring out Nina's passionate personality but the attempts become Nina's obsessive delusions regarding her fear of being unable to be perfect: she imagines all manner of events and body changes, finding that her only friend Lily (Mila Kunis) leads her into an even more distorted lifestyle - or does she...  The manner in which Nina transforms herself into the black swan is breathtaking and the climax of the film leaves the audience wondering about the real ending versus another version of Nina's broken mind.<br /><br />The cast is excellent, with Natalie Portman (who trained into her own balletic role so that she could perform Odette/Odile credibly) delivering a brilliant performance as the fragile, vulnerable, mentally disturbed Nina.  Her partner in the ballet, David, dancing the role of the Prince, is Benjamin Millepied - a remarkably magnetic actor/dancer with whom Portman is now engaged and pregnant.  Vincent Cassel and Barbara Hershey raise their characters to an even higher level than the script - wholly and terrifyingly credible. At times Aronofsky could have used some restraint in showing the repeated delusions of Nina's broken mind and the impact would have been a bit more subtle.  Mathew Libatique provides elegant cinematography and Clint Mansell reinterprets the Tchaikovsky score - sometimes it works, other times it is maddenly warped: the most successful plagiarism is in the piano-only reduction during the credits.  But the overall impact at film's end is a stunning work and a tribute to the talent of Natalie Portman.

054531058X|5.0|When I first heard one of my friends talking about this book, I thought it was a little disturbing for my taste. They finally talked me into reading it and I was so impressed. When I went to find it in the library I was very surprised to find it in the teen book area. Don't let the category fool you. While this is not a book filled with large, intellectual words; it is a page turner with a very powerful message. Standing up for what you believe in! The thing I liked the most about this book was the feeling that Suzanne Collins was not too far off in the events that lead up to Panem being the way it is in her book. She makes it seem possible that we as a country really could end up like this if something is not done now. I think every teenage child and adult should read this book, it will stay with you forever. 5 stars!!!!

B002XTBE8I|4.0|To be honest,I first bought Relapse when it first came out,Had it for a while,then got rid of it,kinda was into it after a while.Then i bough Refill in early 2010,then got rid of that,for some reason its one of those albums that i get into,then out of.Im Way more of a Dr.Dre fan,than a Eminem fan,so im more of a fan of the Production(beats),than Eminems rapping(which is pretty good,and weird lol).My number one reason im going to rebuy this album is for the Dr.Dre beats,and because like all hip-hop fans should be is about the beats,then rapping should come second.Plus im an Eminem fan,and this is one of my favorite albums from him since Marshall Mathers LP.This LP can make you laugh,mad,and confused at the same time,as he constantly disses Christopher Reeves(Who passes,and lived in pain in his last years),which i find very shady(no pun intended).    My 5 Favorite Songs Are  1)Forever(A Drake song,im a fan of Drake a lot more,Drake had the best Verse,Em is 2nd)  2)Beautiful(Em showcases his producing abilities once again,as he conveys a sad,but inspirational song)  3)Undeground(Em is a psycho also a song prod.by Dr.Dre with 50 Cent,this song showcases Ems lyrical ability,as hes his old slim shady self again  4)Must Be The Ganja(Dr.Dre is a monster,guess thats why he partnered up with Monster to make Beats By Dre headphones,great beat/lyrics,must hear by Em & Dre)  5)Drop the Bomb on 'Em(Once again,you can tell im a huge Dr.Dre fan,Dre gives Em another banger like always,and Em finishes the job by killing this beat lyrically)

However, I think they could've chosen a better husband part than Tim McGraw, who does virtually nothing for the movie (yet I am a country-western music person & love his music). His part is rather small and in the background of the story as Sandra Bullock is the main female character along with Quinton Aaron \\"Michael\\" as she calls him, the black, homeless teen she takes in as her own family. This is definitely a MUST SEE! (Also, Sandra looks great as a blonde, in my opinion!
0345440900|4.0|I felt compelled to write this review after reading so many negative comments. I am a mother of two children and this book was exactly what I needed to get started on the daily life of raising a baby. The E.A.S.Y routine worked wonders and learning how to interpret my babies ques was incredibly insightful and a relief!   I am a HUGE proponent of allowing my baby fall asleep on their own. I am by no means going to let them 'cry it out' but when I notice my baby getting tired: I lay them down! Babies learn quickly and if they learn to only fall asleep by rocking in your arms, guess what? That is going to get old very quickly especially a few months down the road when you want to say, have dinner with your spouse? Have your friends over for dinner?  And for those who are appalled at, dare I say it... formula...GASP! Yes, breast is best but for those who can not nurse, choose not to nurse, or when it does not work out, the information in the book is very helpful.   As a new parent who is looking for any tips on how to make your daily life a little more peaceful, read this book. Take what you want out of it and apply it as it fits you and your baby.
B0043LUR6E|5.0|If you liked Julianna Margulies is ER, then you'll love her as Alicia Florrick, the wife of a disgraced State's Attorney (played by Chris Noth from \\"Sex and the City's - \\"Mr. Big\\" among other movies). She pursues her career as a State's Attorney, partnering with Will (played by Josh Charles as the tenacious detective in \\"Four Brothers\\" as well as \\"Little City\\" with Jon Bon Jovi); there is chemistry between the two, which adds as a side, on-going story line as to whether they will come together or not intimately. Alicia and Will are a great team and make for a great TV program with the suspense of looking for justice! A MUST SEE TV Program!
B004E547D8|1.0|I stupidly ordered this without realizing it only has Dolby Digital.  I ASSUMED this was a thing of the past and all new Blurays would have HD audio.  Big mistake.  Next time instead of trying to save a few $$$ at Amazon I will buy it locally.  For a few dollars more I could have had the 'real' version.<br /><br />BTW - The movie was excellent.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|Even though I'm in my early 50's, I loved watching this show each week! I didn't discover the show from the first season, but quickly fell in love with it once I \\"did\\" start watching it!  I own all Four Complete Seasons! The talent of Peter Gallagher, Kelly Rowan, Ben Mckenzie, Adam Brody, Melinda Clarke, Rachel Bilson, Autumn Reeser, Willa Holland, Alan Dale, Tate Donovan & Chris Carmack made the show so fantastic to watch! A MUST BUY SETS!
0452289963|5.0|Fantastic book. Not only is the content enlightening and intellectually stimulating, but it truly provides tools for living a peaceful, happy life. Moreover, the book is written in many small sections and so it is easy to read - even for those people who don't have time to read large sections at one time.
B002ZCY7SW|5.0|Jack Bauer (Kiefer Sutherland) has kept us on the edge of our seats week after week for 8 years (or 8 days should I say?)! I own all 8 Complete Seasons and watch them more than once as I loved the suspense of this show and never being able to figure out what would come next. This 8th Season gave an adrenaline rush with the most conspiracies of all seasons! Why another awesome TV program canceled is beyond me! MUST BUY ALL SEASONS to watch over & over!
B0041OOJNU|4.0|I think Shakira fans will find this album pleasing. This finds Shakira back in top form. Oral Fixation Vol. 1 and Vol. 2 were not as well received as might be expected (however, I found them both to be exceptional). This album, though, shows more strengths than weaknesses. The track \\"Lo Que Mas\\" doesn't do the album any favors, but the additional material is strong enough here that a less than great track distracts little from the overall product. This is definitely Shakira's most \\"Latino\\" sounding album in that it captures South American and Caribbean rhythms in a way that her previous efforts have not, or only hinted at. Donde Estan Los Ladrones is an alternative rock album, while her follow up efforts were decidedly pop with some world music influences thrown in. Not even Pies Descalzos has the Latin ambience of Sale El Sol. Even so, this album is quite broad and offers a lot, and amazingly it all works cohesively. Shakira always opens her albums with songs that draw you in, though she does so with more subtlety than normal on Sale El Sol, she doesn't compromise style or beauty. \\"Gordita\\" is an irresistible flirt fest with Calle 13 who delivers a rap that is lyrically stellar and surprisingly nasty (although not nearly as vulgar or as surprising as his appearance on Nelly Furtado's \\"No Hay Igual\\").  \\"Antes de la Seis\\", \\"Devocion\\", and \\"Mariposas\\" add a range and texture that elevates the album to great places. This is an album that is enjoyable upon the first listen but becomes more so with repeated listening. Consider it an adventure; Shakira is a wonderful guide.
B0001AP158|5.0|I liked this Live Bon Jovi Concert so much that I bought two copies because I know I'm going to wear one out eventually since I watch it so much!

1597801585|5.0|This is a chore to read but well worth the time.  The plot is complex, the characters are complex and some of the messages \\"way out there\\" but I enjoyed the ride.  Entertainment value a \\"ten\\".
1439133948|4.0|It's been a while since the last Miles Vorkosigan book (in fact I believe Bujold had indicated a few years ago she felt she was done with them), but at long last he's back. If you aren't familiar with the series, this probably isn't the place to start; I'd recommend the Warrior's Apprentice (or Cordelia's Honor, which is about his mother and pre-dates the series).    It's an older Miles in this book; there are still hints of his manic personality and recklessness, but tempered by experience and responsibility now. Very little of the action-adventure style from earlier books - though there is still some action - but instead more of a focus on Miles gathering information and solving problems. Overall I think this book is better than the last couple in the series, but doesn't quite reach the heights of the early books. The ending hints that there is more to come. Worth reading for fans of the series.
B003FVI2KQ|4.0|Looking at this from a dollar spent per unit of power, this CPU is about the best value you can get (at the time of this writing).  Slightly outperforms my i7 920.  Paired this with 4 GB CORSAIR XMS3 DHX and the Gigabyte Socket AM3/AMD 890GX motherboard.  Oh, also, let this thing fly with a SSD from Intel (I used the 60GB version) and it hums along very well.  Using a standard hard drive for data and a few bigger apps.      My only complaint is that the stock fan/sink has to spin too fast to keep this cool.  Bought an aftermarket Cooler Master Hyper N520 for $30 and solved that problem. Now the case is very quiet.  Throw in a XFX Radeon HD 6870 and you have a Directx 11 capable desktop that runs very fast, very quiet and doesn't break the bank.    I would have given this 5 stars but was disappointed with the stock cooler AMD provides with this CPU.  Also, don't bother installing the dynamic CPU optimizer tool which is supposed to moderate the overclocking according to demand.  It created wierd blue screen lock ups occasionally under W7 followed by auto reboot.  After I removed this it behaved well.  If overclocking is your thing, do this from the BIOS, not from this tool. IMHO don't bother.  Get a good long life from this CPU as it sits.  If you haven't put an SSD in your computer, and you are overclocking, you are wasting your time.  Your best money spent to go faster is with the SSD, after you put this CPU in.
0385732554|5.0|I came upon this book at school.The Giver was ordered to be read for assigments.Most students objected to such things, stating that they are boring.Though at the end of the read I left.I didnt remember its name or its publisher but the story stuck in my head.I would suggest you read it seriously.It might not be as exciting or fast paced as some other books teens like, but it will stick to you.
B002Q9MZF6|5.0|OMG I have never seen such a lovely rendition of La Boheme as this and I have four. I am not an opera purist and evaluate based on the total experience; voices, sound, orchestra, staging and realism, scenary, fit of characters to the opera, etc. And finally this is the only version where I actually wept for Mimi. Natrebko and Villazon are spectacular and they will make you forget about Pavarotti, Domingo, Freni and Scotto. And wait till you see the wickedly sublime Musetta....she is worth the price of the DVD alone.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|These work amazingly well. I am so happy to finally have something that works after I receives two headsets that did not and i needed to return them. This brand is reliable and this sender is as well. i am extremely happy with my purchase.
B000059QY3|5.0|If the filming of this opera had been botched like many, the DVD would be worth getting just to see and hear Angela Gheorghiu. I see no flaws in this opera and so thankful to have carefully read everyone's review before buying. I have no need to even explore another La Traviata since in my opinion this is perfection and it was ear and eye candy from beginning to end. Here is a woman born to sing this role.
0064430170|5.0|This is a classic BEDTIME story. Some of the other people's comments were really dumb. Why are you looking for a stimulating, laugh-out-loud book to put your little ones to sleep. Why are you trying to read it to a 9 yr old while he's playing video games. The book doesn't suck, you suck and your purpose for buying it. It is definitely for babies and toddlers. Plus parents we have to remember that any book can be boring depending on how you read it. You aren't suppose to like it, you're grown and don't have the mind of a small child. They'll love it, read it to them in a soft voice that bedtime requires.
B0007Q6PBK|3.0|I now have 4 La Bohemes after reading carefully the fine reviews. Having reviewed the four versions and comparing them for total experience this is worth getting only to see Pavarotti and Scotto probably in their primes vocally. Neither of them really fit as Rodolfo and Mimi (stout and past age 40) and this was shot before the MET figured out how to shoot a live performance as they now do. Many times the singers are in the dark due to poor stage lighting. So get it for the great voices even though Pavarotti misses the high C. For total enjoyment get the movie with Natrebko and Villazon; and if you want to see a sublimely wicked Musetta. Niska is not a terribly convincing Musetta in this version. But get this for your video library only as a historical moment in opera.
B004APVI1G|5.0|Interesting & entertain movie. Shows in essence human behavior can turn out greedy, evil and selfish; but with a nice ending showing kids how LOVE will ALWAYS be a strong winner in life.
0441013597|5.0|It's been a good 20 years since I've read Dune. I've been introducing my 10-year old to science fiction and thought I'd see if he was ready for Herbert's classic. I'd forgotten the intensity of the story-telling. Herbert's language is big and bold and you get a sense of the poetry his son writes that Frank H. used when crafting this SciFi classic. There is no levity in the story. All aspects of the plot are deep and weighty and dramatic.     I found myself realizing how the core plot can be found in many an epic tale - Kings and Queens battling over power and treasure. The setting is science fiction, but there's a significant fantasy component baked into the prophetic and magical powers of the two lead characters: Paul and his mother Jessica.     This story is placed in a space-traveling future on a planet called Dune...as desolate, dry and remote as the name sounds. The Atreides family is in a generations-long battle with the Harkonnen family. Both are embroiled in the treacherous manipulations of the Imperial Emperor, the all-female religion-building Bene Gesserit, and the space traveling monopoly holding Guild.     Herbert has built an imaginative, vast and realistic Universe. It's clear from this debut novel in a series whose publications stretch over 40 years, that Herbert put a tremendous amount of thought and effort into layering on the flesh of his world's history, past, and future. And all aspects are based in bits and pieces of our own histories, religions and cultures. And this doesn't even cover the very clear and obvious ecological message wrapped around the true central figure of the book - Planet Dune. The metaphysical philosophizing works well within the royal dramas and intrigues.     This edition contains an afterward written by Herbert's son Brian who's carried on the Dune tradition with a series of books published over the last several years placed in the Dune universe along various timelines relative to Dune.    Stay away from the movies, but absolutely jump (back) into this book. At about 500 pages, it's still a fast and exciting read.
B0015DROBO|5.0|I'm actually hard to please, as far as mysteries go.  It's about every ten years I get a book that I just can't put down.  This book, and the two others that make up this trilogy, consumed all of my spare time for a week.  In Lisbeth Salander I found one of the most original and interesting characters I've run across in my 60 years.  I actually found myself caring about all the cast of characters in the trilogy.  Each person has his or her own reaction.  Some people in here couldn't see what the fuss was about.  I just thought I'd put my vote in with the five-star group.
1439133948|2.0|Both myself and my wife loves Miles.  However, Cryoburn is not a good read.  It starts disjointedly at the end of a 'skirmish'.  It doesn't tell the reader why Miles is on this planet (his motivation) until a full third of the book.  Furthermore the motivation is quite flimsy.  It never explained why he takes an intense interest in an eleven-year old boy.  The point of view of the narration changes far too often and seldom focuses on Miles.  I wasn't able to understand how many years (and what had transpired in Miles' life) since the last book.  The book seemed to be a short story which was unnecessarily padded to make a book.  The end of the book was 25 pages too long.  The last part of the book, a tragedy in Miles' life, is gratuitous and should have been the start of her next book.  It wasn't her or her editor's best work or even fair work.
0439023521|4.0|The Ultimate Reality Show!<br /><br />Using a science fictional back-drop, Suzanne Collins makes several attempts at analogy to criticize not only Big Brother and no matter its original intent, how people will go on supporting the Hunger Games despite the killings of their children, but also how a naive young woman, deals not only with self-sacrifice and a possible love interest, but struggles with her own rebellious nature.  Or, in short, wow!<br /><br />As mentioned in other reviews, we have a future time where the USA has been destroyed and even some years after that, where the new nation known as Panem had quelled a rebellion of the surrounding 13 districts.  (13 districts - original 13 colonies perhaps?  Just a thought.)  The Hunger Games are established, per our heroine Katniss, to let the other districts know that the Capital is in charge and that they can do anything they want, including making a tradition of ritualistic homicide!<br /><br />The homicide is dressed up to look pretty and attractive, complete with sponsors, over-enthusiastic handlers and a game-show atmosphere that would put our current reality shows to shame.<br /><br />Unlike other dystopic stories I've read, we have a continuance of high level broadcasting, medical science demonstrated and hovercraft.  On the other hand we have extreme poverty.  The games are used as carrots for the poorer districts - get your kids to join in the games and you will get a supply of grain and other foodstuffs and gifts.<br /><br />Begs the question:  what is your family worth?  Katniss notices that her sister is picked to go to the games.  Realizing that little girl would not stand a chance, she goes in Prim's place.  She amazes herself about this and remarks how other families have never done such a thing in so long that the protocol is rusty on this point.<br /><br />Another question:  Contrivance and lies to encourage sponsor support.  I had to laugh at this as it is so true.  Even today we have sponsors pulling their support from former spokespersons due to their own immorality and sexual misconduct.  In The Hunger Games, sponsors will pull out if you're not vicious enough or their heart-strings are not pulled enough.<br /><br />The romance contrivance was predictable but fun to see how it unfolds:  Katniss and her partner from the same District 12, Peeta, contrive a romance that brings in sponsors and gifts.  But she's confused:  Is Peeta faking or does he really love her?<br /><br />Katniss' natural rebellious nature, her comments about her friend Gale (yes, silly, you love him, get over it!) and her conflicting feelings for Peeta and her growing rebellion against the Capital and their deadly Games, make for some interesting reading, despite a few inconsistencies here and there.<br /><br />Can't wait for Catching Fire!ersons due to their own immorality and sexual misconduct.

1600595871|5.0|This is an excellent book for those who don't already have Alisa Golden's books.  I'm disappointed that it was advertised like it was a NEW book of hers. It is a combination of two books I already have.  I think this should have been noted in the advertisement for it on the Amazon website.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|I'm loving this series. My daughter introduced it to me when she got a DVD set of the first season, I wasn't all that interested in watching it, as I don't watch much television. Now, we watch \\"our show\\" at least three times a week (sometimes everyday). Jensen and Jared are both cute and are good actors, the stories are clever, and the special and other visual effects are great.   Entertaining!
0671042858|4.0|King's talent for writing, for creating scenes rich in character and original plot lines, is very clear.  Those who review this book negatively seem to be type-casting King as only a horror author, yet he has been writing non-horror all along (at one point using a pseudonym to do it).  Anyone who enjoyed \\"The Body\\" in King's collection of novellas, _Different Seasons_, will very much like this book, _The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon_.  There is a bit of the supernatural in here, but it is mostly a survival story of a girl lost in the woods.  At times the suspense is in wondering if the protagonist is imagining a monster following her in the woods (as we all would do if we were lost in the woods at such an age) -- or if there really is a monster following her in the woods.<br /><br />I've knocked off a star only because it didn't give me the ending I was hoping for... I enjoy the psychological thriller more than pure horror... and it's at the end that the horror writer side of Stephen King comes through.  Even so, King does know how to weave a tale and keep his readers interested.
B0014I4KIK|1.0|I hate to pan anyone as I'm a kind person and am enthusiastic about many kinds of music, especially this genre, but I strongly suggest you listen to all the samples of songs on this album before purchasing. The same beat permeated every single song and the material all sounded alike. I didn't think this original material showed the strong talent many reviewers (and Vanity Fair) heard. I can't remember enjoying a CD less.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|I'm not going to bother with summing up the plot but will instead get down to the nitty-gritty. The movie was interesting enough for me to say it was OK but in no way did it live up to the hype which it has garnered. I went into this expecting to see something scary, or at least suspenseful, but was instead thwarted on both fronts. The critics must have given this film its rave reviews based solely on its \\"daring\\" display of lesbianism and masturbation (although no nudity is displayed in the entire movie) because it barely has any other memorable moments short of the actual acting performances themselves (which are actually worthy of their critical acclaim). At a certain point in the movie you start to wonder if the odd \\"visions\\" Portman's character keeps having are ever going to amount to anything more than a weak attempt by the writer/director to startle you. It seems like they are just tossed at you for pure shock value alone. There's no plot twists to speak of, just a feeble attempt to confuse the viewer into thinking that something way cooler than the actual ending is coming. During the lesbian scene I had hopes that the story would finally justify all the pointless \\"visions\\" and the two girls would swap bodies or something but, alas, this would have been too interesting to have conceived. Ultimately the viewer is forced to endure innumerable meaningless \\"surprises\\" until the less than adequate ending rears its ugly head.    I would recommend renting this if you want to see it but don't buy it first. In my opinion it is neither scary nor suspenseful and is a vastly inferior film for all the hype it has attracted.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I have now about worn this CD out...LOL. I have always loved Josh Groban's recordings, but there is just something different about this one, don't know if it is the choice of songs, the background music, his incredible voice or maybe a combo of all three, but it is awesome & I keep listening to it over & over. I hope that he makes more like this one!

B004AHNIGM|5.0|Gregg Allman's new album is a winner ! If you are looking for a new Allman Brothers Band album, keep waiting. If you are looking for a traditional blues album that covers a wide spectrum of blues styles, then this is it ! I've been an Allman Bros / Gregg Allman fan for years but I didn't know he could be so versatile. Blues from the Delta, Chicago, urban, even Mississippi boogie. This is the type of album that could inspire a blues revival in this country. We could sure use it. If you are debating if you should purchase this CD, you can stop. Go get it !  P.S. There are downloads available not on the album that are worthwhile too, including a smoking version of Reconsider Baby.
0425166805|5.0|Through the years, I have owned several editions of this book, Chariots of the Gods, and Erich Von Daniken really explores quite a few issues within this very fine and intriguing book. Von Daniken refers to specific passages within the Judeo Christian Holy Bible, and I have crossed referenced each verse, and it is evident that Von Daniken has done extensive research to corroborate his claims. One particular detail which Von Daniken emphasizes is the fact that he asks many questions throughout the book, and he explores possibilities of answers to questions rather than simply making blatant and unfounded statements. True science asks questions and skeptics as well as true nonbelievers are quick to deem this book as lacking adequate validity, however as scientific knowledge continues to progress, it seems that Von Daniken has an increasingly credible foundation to his beliefs and postulations.
B0043X7WLA|5.0|This album is very original. It still contains Sufjan's style, but just in a brand new medium. That medium is a large amount of electronic sounds. It's beautifully orchestrated, and as usual the lyrics are great. I'm a fan of the artist that is dynamic and is willing to try new genres and styles. If you can't you handle change, then this is probably going to be a shocker.
B000008I4Z|5.0|Brave is a 5 star progressive concept masterpiece.A dark journey of a girl found wandering alone on a bridge with no memory of she she was..Hogarth performs his excellent writing and singing skills.Steve Rothery plays his guitar so well and sometimes hauntingly so.All around top notch concept album with excellent playing by all.The title song Brave is beautifully haunting and emotional and one of my all time favs.The albums climaxes with The Great Escape and after a short silince it ends with Made Again a nice little tune thats lifts you up.This is a do not miss album,Highly recommended.Take the time,sit down and listen to it loud with the lights off!
0385491026|5.0|Elaine, a painter rapidly approaching old age, has returned to her hometown of Toronto for a retrospective of her work.  While there, wandering the familiar streets from her childhood, she flashes back to a time when she was nine years old, tormented constantly by her three best friends, almost to the point of death.  With enough time to think about her past, she comes to see what happened to her, and why, how she managed to block out her horror for so many years, and how her experiences came through in her painting.    This book was fantastic.  It perfectly captured the terror of a girl being bullied by those she considers friends, and the helplessness of not being able to ask anyone for help.    I loved the way the narrator of this story started at the two ends of her life, first explaining where she was in the present and the earliest parts of her life, while slowly bringing these two ends closer and closer together, working both backward from her adult life and forward through her childhood in order to eventually give a clear picture of her whole lifelong experience.    I also loved the atmosphere of dread in every part of this story, the sinister undertone of nearly everything the narrator lived through in her childhood, and how clear the meanings of her paintings are when you understand her background.    Every aspect of this book was well crafted and fascinating, and I couldn't put it down.

B004GHYCKW|4.0|During the first decade of her career (1991-2000) Harvey was one of the most deservedly acclaimed artists in all of music. In fact much of her work during that period is among the most varied and challenging (and best) popular music ever released: Whether the potent blues-punk of \\"Dry\\" and \\"Rid of Me\\", the industrial/gospel/blues-mythology of \\"To Bring You My Love\\" (arguable her best work), or the refined, emphatically heartfelt \\"Stories From the City, Stories From the Sea\\" (2000), she seemed incapable of a misstep. Her work became both less prolific and less inspired. Apart from a collaboration with band-mate John Parrish, the next decade only saw two releases: \\"Uh-huh Her\\" was an uninspired hodgepodge of her previous approaches, while \\"White Chalk\\" consisted of decent, but somewhat pedestrian piano-based ballads. \\"Let England Shake\\" is her most inspired, consistent album in a decade.    Thematically \\"Let England Shake\\" is poignant and mournful like much or her earlier work, but the songwriting is more fully realized, and the music is richer and fuller than an White Chalk. While she doesn't really take any major departures, she finds ways to embellish her sound. Perhaps most interestingly, she sometimes directly uses other artists as a partial substrate: \\"Written on the Forehead,\\" samples Niney the Observers' \\"Blood and Fire\\", while \\"The Glorious Land\\" includes a traditional bugled battle hymn of the U.S. Cavalry. On a few other tracks she subtly infuses elements like horns, brass, and maybe even a xylophone (I think). The result is a lush, warm album that deftly combines both modern and traditional musical elements: Perhaps the perfect stage for Harvey's mournful ruminations on the national and personal destruction wrought by war.    Though her emotional and thematic complexity always defies easy description and understanding, \\"Let England Shake\\" can be generally interpreted as both a love letter to and a eulogy for her home country of England and the carnage wrought by military conflict. Throughout the record, there are vivid, painful images of death in various forms and stages. Despite her agonizing lyricism, Harvey almost always manages to keep \\"Let England Shake\\" resolutely dignified and compelling; rather than wholly succumbing to the carnage and darkness, she uses the grief as a source of inspiration (and vocally, she's still in top form).    While they are very different albums, much as she did with \\"To Bring You My Love\\", Harvey has pulled off a rare accomplishment on \\"Let England Shake\\": She marries grand, inspired music with poignant, mournful themes in a way that makes both elements more compelling than they would be separately. While she's not as emphatic, bold, and immediate as she was in her peak, with this album she reasserts herself as one of the most sophisticated, poetic, articulate, and uniquely undefinable musical artists. To me, this is her first album that's both unapologetically mature and genuinely inspired.

0312370849|3.0|This was almost a 5 star book, I loved the first half. The third person narrative of Sarah's life was riveting, I just couldn't wait to keep reading about her hellish experience and was rooting for her. Things changed once this narrative stopped in the middle of the book. I just didn't care about Julia Jarmond (fake American name, sounds French to me) and her obnoxious husband Bertrand. Their daughter Zoe just didn't ring true for me, I have 2 daughters around her age, she just wasn't a believable character. I also didn't feel the Julia/William thing...just seemed like there was nothing there. I found the Michel's story predictable and the name of Julia's baby, but that didn't bother me much. What really bothered me is when Julia and Zoe moved to NY and Zoe, at around age 13ish was attending Trinity College just around the corner...say what??? Trinity College is in Hartford, CT and Zoe wasn't old enough to attend.  Overall a good read, but quite flawed.

B001UV4XHY|2.0|I thought David Yate did a terrible job in HP 7( and i thought the sixth movie was the worst, boy was i wrong). there was no sense of emotion, no sense of danger. And where was the soundtrack? there was barely any soundtrack in the movie, you need music to convey some kind of emotion. The way the director did the action scene ( the fighting in the sky) was barely recognizable. I didn't know what was going on. The music to that scene was so off that it puzzled me why the director would go that route instead of a more sinister and intense music. This is why John Williams should have scored the entire movie ( The studio should have paid him double, no triple to keep him rather than let him go). Anyways, after watching DH part 1, there is no hope that DH part 2 would be any better. I truly think that David Yates has destroyed a franchise that could've lasted for decades to come.   Oh, forgot one thing: Dobby's death was done so terribly. I felt more sad for cedric dying in Movie 4 than Dobby. Again barely any score was played for him. And then they randomly decided to add Luna to the scene. I'll conclude that the studio obviously is being as cheap as possible in order to increase their profit margin for these films. You could tell that they didn't want to hire a talented director along with talented composer and use the top notch special effect to make these films much better. They know if they make a poor or at best mediocre film that fans would pour into the theaters just to see what they read come to life. They know regardless of the outcome of the product, people would at least see the movie one time. In the short-run this would gain them ample amount of money but in the long-term, the future generation would see how crappy the film are and just might skip it all together. *sigh* it's really a pity that such a franchise that started good has come to such mediocre ending. I gave it two stars because some of the acting were good ( not just from the trio) and \\"the taleof the three brothers\\" scene. Not for the ministry scene( wasn't suspenseful enough or have the feel like evil has taken over the ministry), or the wedding scene ( a bit too casual instead of tension, No krum, but loved Luna and her father silly dance), or the forest scenes ( too long, should have used those minutes on other scenes like adding Krum discussing about the deathly hallow or when harry and friends were trapped at Malfoy's Manor instead of rushing that scene) or..... I can go on but i'll stop.

1416583432|2.0|Regardless of the ton of information squeezed into this oh-so-long book, the author comes through as a researcher often drawing erroneous conclusions for lack of understanding the subject. An example illustrating this is her statement that dogs don't hunt for food. As an owner of dogs who hunt, and eat, field rodents on our farm, I can assure the author that she is incorrect. There are other such gems in this book, which renders all other research suspect.<br /><br />This book reads like a transcription from a series of lectures, some more boring than others. The author has an incredibly annoying manner of inserting \\"as we will see later\\" in middle of sentences. I had a sense of sitting in an auditorium listening to someone pontificate about a subject with which she is quite unfamiliar.<br /><br />The boring, long-winded writing style and the blatant factual errors irritated me to the point that I had to stop reading the book about half way through. I will not recommend it to my friends and I will not re-read it, a true test of a good book for me.
B004DMAZQK|3.0|'Lose My Life' was my favorite album from 2009, so needless to say I was very excited for the follow-up. I've given it a few listens in different conditions and each one reinforced my first impression: it's not nearly as inspired or interesting as their first. The only way that it's similar is that it has a standout single that goes above everything else on the CD. On 'Lose My Life' it was the epic song \\"Death\\" that stood out. On 'Ritual' it's \\"Bigger Than Us.\\" That is the only song on the album worth spending money on; everything else seems to be pure filler and didn't get even a minute emotional reaction from me. I hate to say it's over so soon in this band's career, but I really hope they make something more endearing next time. This has all the signs of a rushed release.

B0043GN6XK|5.0|This new release is as good as it gets. It is the first recording of Vivaldi's opera `Ercole sul Termodonte', first staged in Rome in 1723 and reconstructed by maestro Fabio Biondi, the conductor on this CD. The details of the reconstruction are given by Biondi in the `Analytical note', pp. 22-27 in the booklet - the text every listener is advised to read. The reconstruction is based on a complete libretto and on a number of arias and a few duets and interludes from `Ercole' preserved in different variants. Biondi wrote all the recitatives for this recording and decided on the orchestration of the survived solos, duets and sinfonias. The survived arias are distributed unevenly: for instance, Ippolita has six arias, while all arias written for Orizia have been lost. In order to keep the balance Biondi has made patches for some of the lost solos and adjusted other Vivaldi's operatic arias to the text of Ercole's libretto. This step is probably justified since Vivaldi himself used to practice the same thing but one cannot be sure whether the gaps are filled with the same music as sounded in Rome in 1723. Biondi also omitted several arias - one Ippolita's aria, one Teseo's aria, one Alceste's aria and one Telamone's aria - where their preservation would slow down the action and lead to an uneven distribution of the material between characters. The solo arias included in Biondi's production are located this way:<br /><br />Ercole (Villazon): CD 1: track 13; CD 2: tracks 13, 25, 39Reconstructed;<br />Orizia (Ciofi): CD 2: tracks 9Rec., 29Rec.; Lost arias: `A un cor generoso', `Torno al campo';<br />Ippolita (DiDonato): CD 1: tracks 22, 29, 33; CD 2: tracks 4, 31; (omitted - `Un certo non so che');<br />Teseo (Basso): CD 1: track 18; CD2: tracks 6, 21, 33; (omitted - `Qual dispersa tortorella');<br />Antiope (Genaux): CD 1: Tracks 4, 8, 31; CD 2: Tracks 37;<br />Martesia (Damrau): CD 1: Tracks 10, 24; CD 2, Tracks 17, 27;<br />Alceste (Jaroussky): CD1: Tracks 15, 26; CD 2: Tracks 15, (Omitted: -`Sol perche t'amo');<br />Telamone (Lehtipuu): CD 2: Track 11; Lost: `Se profasti il mia fede';  (Omitted -`Lascia di sospirar);<br /><br />Since this is the first recording of `Ercole', I lack a comparison and can only judge the soloists on the basis of their vocal achievements here.<br /><br />Rolando Villazon (Ercole) is very good in the title role. I am not sure that his intonation and timbre conform to all HIP canons but this is of probably of minor importance: since Hercules came to the Amazons' kingdom from a different world, Villazon as a classical tenor may be a welcome guest of the baroque opera. All Ercole's solos are bravura pieces in major tonalities. The best music however is in the last aria, `Coronatemi le chiome' (CD 2, track 39), reconstructed by Biondi from the fragments of `Tito Manlio': it is designed to demonstrate the tenor's range and the heroic strength of his character.<br /><br />Patricia Ciofi (Orizia) gets only two solos which is a pity - her well-rounded high notes and a warm timbre are delightful. The best solo piece of her character is `Cadero, ma sopra il vinto' (CD 2, track 29), reconstructed by Biondi from the music of `Artabano'. This item is on the level of Ciofi's & Biondi's marvelous CD of Vivaldi's motets [[ASIN:B0002ZBSMW Vivaldi: Motets]].<br /><br />Joyce DiDonato (Ippolita) is singing the main female role. DiDonato's mellow mezzo and effortless vocalization suit perfectly to her character. The best Ippolita's aria is undoubtfully the last one - `Amato ben' (CD 2, track 31). Biondi in his liner note calls this aria one of Vivaldi's biggest operatic hits, and I agree with him.<br /><br />Romina Basso (Teseo) is engaged in the major trouser role. Her voice is a low mezzo-soprano with secure but rather muffled low notes. She is very good throughout her role but I was not touched by her final aria `Ti sento, si ti sento', (CD 2, track 33) which is a response to Ippolita's `Amato ben'.<br /><br />Vivica Genaux (Antiope) as the Amazons' queen has to sing lots of nervous and aggressive music in the vein of her `Pyrotechnics's CD with Biondi [[ASIN:B002M3GQ5G Pyrotechnics: Vivaldi Opera Arias]]. She copes well with this task but I wish that her high trill were executed as clearly as by Ciofi. Her final Prestissimo aria `Scendero, volero, gridero' (CD 2, 39) is an amazing achievement though. In the rare moments, where Antiope does not have to posit herself as a virago and to sing to a inhuman tempo, Genaux shows beautiful vocals, as in the aria `Bel piacher ch'e la vendetta' (CD 1, track 31).<br /><br />Diana Damrau (Martesia) is cast in a technically less demanding ing&eacute;nue role. Her final aria `Se ben sente' (CD 2, track 17) is probably the gem of her part.<br /><br />Philippe Jaroussky (Alceste) gets a part originally written for young Carestini - a famous singer to whom Jaroussky has dedicated one of his solo CDs [[ASIN:B000VLR0JM Philippe Jaroussky - Carestini (The Story of a Castrato)]]. However, this male soprano part is static. Jaroussky is on his usual high level but his rendering of Alceste's last aria `Io sembro appunto' (CD 2, track 15) which Biondi claims is a big hit left me cold.  I even found Alceste's previous aria `Sento con qual diletto' (CD 1, track 15) more interesting. Both mentioned arias have been repeatedly used by Vivaldi in his operas.<br /><br />Topi Lehtipuu (Telamone) is cast as second tenor. Originally, his part included 3 arias but one of them got lost and another one was omitted by Biondi. The remaining item `Tender lacci' (CD 2, track 11) is pleasant but it is eclipsed by other solos.<br /><br />Biondi's firm hand is felt both in sinfonias and interludias and in the instrumental supports of the arias. He also performs violin and viola d'amour solos. His orchestra, Europa Galante, responds well to its conductor.<br /><br />I do not see any serious shortcomings in this production. Possibly except for one: every listener will establish himself/herself whether he/she wants to repeat Vivaldi's `Ercole' in its entirety or to pick up favourite arias from it.ve music in the vein of her `Pyrotechnics's CD with Biondi [[ASIN:B002M3GQ5G Pyrotechnics: Vivaldi Opera Arias]].

B0049OSQ18|2.0|When I first listened to this album I was working and when the album ended I was surprised because I thought it was just the first song. They had all blended together to me because they sounded so similar. Their attempt at mellow country just caused their songs to sound identical to me and non descript. Almost the sound of mediocrity.     When I listen to The Decemberist I expect something different, unusual, exciting, and fun. I also expect a story, preferably one that took place long ago. But I listened to their interview on NPR last night and the interviewer said he didn't hear an over arching theme as in other albums, but Colin Meloy said they actually thought long and hard about it and worked to incorporate it. But like the interviewer I didn't hear any.     I am glad they tried something new, and I'm also glad many people enjoy the album, but I sincerely hope they return to their style that I loved in their previous albums.
B003NWS5AO|4.0|I heard somewhere that Plant was originally a blues singer, and that shows here. I didn't think I would like this album, but after listening through it, I fell in love with, particularly \\"Falling In Love Again\\" and \\"Angel Dance.\\" If you like folk music, you will like this album. Plant's vocal talents are still very strong, and this album has emotional highs and lows, \\"Angel Dance\\" being one of the highest, \\"Silver Rider\\" one of the lowest. It's a variety, almost like a candy box, and it's worth a listen.
0767817478|5.0|Okay so its no GODZILLA, but TOHO officially renamed the monster ZILLA.  The film is great, my one complaint is they kill it with just rockets, they hit GODZILLA with rockets, has GODZILLA died before? Of course, but, they had to use intricate and complex weaponry to do it, like the oxygen destroyer, or Mechagodzilla 3. But all in all this is an awesome movie, I loved the effects, as good as Jurassic Park.   But at least it wasn't the sub-par Cloverfield movie.

1932100660|3.0|Should we cut down on animal protein? Absolutely! American's generally eat way too much animal protein, and not  as much of the stuff we should be eating like whole grains, legumes, fruits and vegetables. But cut it out completely for fear we may make ourselves susceptible to the variety of diseases the author claims animal protein leads to? What about the Mediterranean diet, considered one of the most healthy diets in the world? What do they eat? Mostly vegetables, fruit, beans, whole grains, olive oil and some animal protein, especially seafood. Or the Asian diet... considered so healthy? They eat plenty of fish.  My mother is in her 80's and strong as an ox. She eats animal protein but she eats small amounts and the rest is mostly grains (white rice at that) and always overcooked veggies and fruit. She eats very little and maybe that's what we should be concentrating on .... moderation. If you ask me. you'd be better off following Mark Bittman's personal method of reducing animal protein in Food Matters- he eats vegan until dinner time. But the advice that makes the most sense to me is the AntiCancer diet by David Servan Schreiber. It's not just for those of us worried about cancer (which we all are), but it just makes so much SENSE. The research in the China Study is fascinating and very convincing. I would urge you though, before you turn yourself vegan to go online and read what others have to say about the research. You may not feel the need to go entirely vegan, as the author recommends. Even T. Colin Campbell admits that it's the higher amounts of proteins that prove detrimental to our health. He recommends cutting it out completely because he feels it's easier to go all the way. A little bit might lead to more and then be too much. Here's what I am going to do; I am not going to have a big steak for dinner, but I may throw in a few slices of thinly sliced, grass fed flank steak with my sauteed vegetables, soy sauce, ginger and garlic. I'll be responsible for less cows being killed because I am cutting down on the amount my family consumes, and I'll get some iron, B12 and some protein - but not too much - and will be able to ENJOY MY FOOD.

B0034G4P7G|2.0|I fail to see all the hype about \\"Social Network.\\" Having written website code since 1997, I was not so impressed. The creator of facebook simply put ideas together creating a website that people like and now facebook is worth billions of dollars. Going to the movies is about entertainment and not about whoever has the most toys wins all the awards. I did not find a great deal of appealing entertainment in this movie. \\"Social Network\\" is 10% witty and 90% fast Indi 500 dialog that rambles on like \\"Lips, shot out of a gun.\\" However, actor Jesse Eisenberg never misses a beat while singer/actor Justin Timberlake, never seems to find his groove. How this movie won Golden Globes, Critics Choice Awards and London Film Critics Circle Awards, is an unsolved mystery, even for the laughable famed detective, Jacques Clouseau. In a year of movies the likes of Black Swan, The Kings Speech and Secretariat, if Social Network wins best picture at the Oscars, it all about politics and not about good entertainment. This movie is a two potato, three potato, just because of Eisenberg's performance.

B002KS1IJC|3.0|The above title really says most of what you need to know.  Sci-fi dude (think \\"Commander Shepard\\" from Mass Effect here) gets stranded in 8th century Norway, attacked by the requisite Vikings, and fights the Big Scary Monster for them.  Think \\"Beowulf\\" meets \\"Aliens\\" meets \\"Predator\\" meets \\"Dances With Wolves\\" and you've got a real good grasp of the film.<br /><br />A bit predictable in lots of places, and a bit cheesy in others.  Some uneven handling of plot events; not sure if this was an editing problem or a script problem, but these situations could have been improved with a very few scenes / exchanges.<br /><br />However, as an sci-fi / monster action flick, more than acceptable overall.  Reasonably enjoyable with a couple of wince moments.  Some portions are done quite well.  The backstory for the monster is decent enough.  Effects are good.  Chances for a sequel are not promising...<br /><br />Three stars plus.  Worth the VOD rental.  Would watch again; I'll pick it up as a purchase if it's ever \\"REALLY\\" cheap...

B001795SH8|3.0|What makes Beethoven's symphonies so hard to get right? Well, whatever the reason, let's get right to it, beginning with the 9th, the most problematic it would seem. So, Abbado's first movement is swift, maybe too swift, though in relistening a number of times it seems about right. Nevertheless, some of the little solo instrument flourishes get glossed over. And also the main motifs don't get their full measure, so to speak. Also, the drama in the phrases don't have enough time to build. At 2:05, you want a deceleration. You want one at 5:00 and 5:35 too. Same at 8:55. Same at 13:10. And while there is a feel of power throughout, there's also a feeling of being soft around the edges. The passages beginning around 9:45 just don't have urgency. The ending is labored.    The 2nd movement begins at a fairly nice pace and maintains it throughout. The effect is almost rousing. You'd like more made of the cadence at 7:42. You'd like more boistrousness. You'd like a nice slowdown at 9:05 and a crisp a tempo at 9:12. Pretty nice ending.    The 3rd movement has a nice pace. I'd play it a bit slower, and dote a bit. I think Abbado wanted to avoid an overly doting treatment, and I'd agree, but a bit of loving doting is called for I feel. Also, when the big cadence happens at about 9:15 it isn't as majestic as it could be with a slightly slower pacing. Similarly for the echo big cadence at about 10:05.    The 4th movement starts nicely. It has a nice rushing feeling that settles down nicely. I like the way Abbado introduces the theme in the bass violins at 2:30, using a piano dynamic. That's very effective. And it slowly builds up to the definitive statement of the theme, just before the entrance of the voice. The voice is totally up to the task, as are the other 3. The chorus is a bit washed out in places. The little march is a little rushed, but not bad. That leads to a spirited section. Then the \\"noble\\" section plays out pretty nicely (though I'd play it a little nobler;), setting up well the \\"release\\" section. The finale has a good amount of fireworks.    The recording is ok, although the percussion is pretty muddy, and the bass section is a bit boomy. It seems the engineers went for the overall gestalt rather than trying to faithfully capture each instrument. (As opposed to the 1986 Solti recording, where each instrument is crystal clear. Cf my review of that CD.)    The portraits of Abbado on the CD covers are very strange. Most of them capture him in odd expressions. I'm surprised he let those be used, but perhaps he is fed up with the rock star presentation so many classical music people get from the publishers and didn't even look at the photos. Maybe he didn't even know the packaging details til it came out.    Update: the 1st and 2nd are very nicely played!    Other symphonies as time permits.

It bogs down in several spots with long explanations of the workings of the mortgage market, but that is to be expected.  Michael Lewis does here what he always does very well, tell stories about people more than events.  The characters are interesting and intriguing and Lewis brings them to life.  Skim the more technical parts and savor the rest.

B003Z9Q4WG|4.0|What a treat!  I had honestly forgotten how superb many of these performances were.  Of course, the Mahler set standards and made us all acolytes of this driven maestro, but to hear again Bernstein's special way with Copland, Diamond, Harris, plus the big romantic pieces like Fantastique, Faust symphony, the Tchaikovsky 6, and the anxieties of Shostakovich reminds how much we miss him today.  Thank you Sony.  I'm not thrilled with the oversize LP box, but I will live with it.  What is the next big \\"Bernstein box\\" out there?  Are there any \\"unpublished\\" Lennie performances we don't know about waiting for release?  I sure hope so.
B0015DROBO|3.0|Dragon Tattoo is an interesting but deeply flawed work of fiction. The core of this book is interesting, but the writing is some of the clunkiest you will ever see. I'm not sure if it's a flawed translation or just a writer's first attempt, but having read the entire series, I do know that it gets better as it goes along.<br /><br />I have to say that it's probably worth giving it a try, but there will be sections with phrasing so bad that your eyes will stop dead on the page.
0471043729|4.0|The article arrived as described by the seller. It looks great and it doesn't have some marginalia and marks in the pages. It looks almost new except for a sticker painted in black in the front, but it's ok.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Having read the entire Millennium trilogy I was honestly surprised by this book. The first two were deeply flawed affairs when taken as a whole. The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo/Men Who Hate Women has some of the clunkiest phrasing and writing I've read in years but I stuck it out because the characters were interesting, even if their motivations were sometimes inane and poorly described. The Girl who Played with Fire was even worse. You could easily dispose of the first half of that book and the rather good second half would not be affected at all. There was meat there, but you had to earn it.<br /><br />This book doesn't suffer from either of those problems. It's well written and it doesn't waste hundreds of pages getting to the point. The plot is intricate and there's not much I could say without spoilers, so I won't even try. If you've read the series up to this point you'll love this book. It's the best of the bunch by far and the only one I could see reading again.

B001NLKT60|3.0|I'm not going to jump into plot analysis here, like some other reviewers will. In fact I'm going to keep this very short and merely point out this books greatest, perhaps fatal, flaw: the entire first half is pointless. According to my Kindle the plot of this book actually starts at the 50% mark. Everything that happens before then could be summed up in two paragraphs and you would miss absolutely nothing. This is certainly the low point of the trilogy. Yet, I kept going anyway, so it clearly has something going for it.

1400049628|4.0|Finally, a book about how to protect yourself from zombies.  This amusing, entertaining, silly and sometimes boring book is for anyone who is into the popular living dead movie culture.  If an outer space race came to visit our planet and picked up this book, they would think we really had a problem with the living dead.  In any case, if you are a fan of the various zombie type movies (28 days, 28 Days Later, the Resident Evil movie series, the Living Dead T.V. series and numerous other zombie like movies etc, etc, etc), you will enjoy reading this book.  This book has everything you will need to combat the living dead menace.<br /><br />There are seven sections in this text.  The Undead: Myths and Realities, Weapons and Combat Techniques, On the Defense, On the Run, On the Attack, Living in an Undead World and Recorded Attacks.  Each section has detailed information to successfully defeat and live with the possibility of being attacked by the undead.<br /><br />In conclusion, this book would be of most interest to those who are fearful of zombies and the undead.  If you \\"see dead people\\"  all the time, you need this book as a reference source.  Remember the undead are everywhere!<br /><br />Rating:  4 Stars.  Joseph J. Truncale (Author:  Predator Hunter: A Warrior's Memoir).

1416594795|5.0|This book was an excellent common sense read on the logic, elegance, and 'mechanics' of Evolution. I enjoyed it just as much as Donald Prothero's great book, 'Evolution: What The Fossils Say And Why It Matters', and Michael Shermer's awesome book 'Why Darwin Matters: The Case Against Intelligent Design'. Of course, as articulate and informative as it is, it will 'go over the heads' of those that are not capable of introspective and logical thought, especially those that have been brainwashed by overzealous, fanatical religious conservatives in this country, and around the world, who wouldn't know reality if their lives depended on it! There will always be AIDS and Holocaust denialists, as well as Evolution denialists. Curiously, in a country as supposedly technologically and scientifically advanced as ours, there are many more here who don't believe in Evolution as compared to other industrialized nations (Europe, for example). I attribute this to the utter and complete brainwashing by the manipulative, anti-science religious right that has dumbed down America with their poisoned agenda, and created mental illness on a level that has never been seen before.
B003L20IHE|5.0|\\"Charlie St. Cloud\\" starring Zac Effron as the title character, is a moving story about a young man discovering his purpose in life, even as he struggles to deal with death. After his younger brother dies in a car crash, Charlie puts his life on hold. His heart may still be beating but he has given up all his dreams and works instead as a cemetery caretaker. His sole joy in life? He meets his (deceased) younger brother every day for a game of catch. He promised he would and he does not want to break his promise for fear that he will truly lose his brother forever. When a beautiful woman comes into his life, he is forced to make a choice between living or holding on to the past.<br /><br />This is an incredibly moving, surprising, life-affirming story. I was riveted by it. It has some very Catholic themes, including a belief in the power of St. Jude and the knowledge that when we die, it is far from the end. It is rated PG-13 and there is the suggestion of an inappropriate sexual act (although nothing is shown). Overall, however, it is incredibly well-done. It will both entertain you and make you think.

This is without question the most well made movie I've seen in years (and I am quite the movie buff so you can take my word for it.).<br /><br />Never before have I fallen in love with all the characters in the movie...each one has a different history..a different (and yet important) viewpoint of the world and when you put all their viewpoints together at the same time, it is like a very very well made stew. This movie will entertain you and like me, you'll wish you could jump into the screen and start a couple of friendships with the Dashwood sisters.<br /><br />Get ready to enjoy a movie of a lifetime.

B004I1AGTC|4.0|Ip Man is still the only martial arts film I've ever given a perfect score. Similar films usually throw in those silly bits of humor that come off as lame rather than actually being humorous. It probably hits its target overseas audience well, but the difference in culture probably has something to do with how American audiences don't appreciate those bits as much. Either that or the storyline is usually fairly simple or borderline atrocious while the fighting scenes are spectacular. If you're a fan of martial arts films, you see these types of films for the action scenes. A good storyline and exceptional acting are usually just a bonus. Ip Man broke those boundaries. It had an intriguing storyline and a fantastic cast to compliment its jaw dropping action sequences. The only flaws the film seemed to have was that it eventually had to end and left the audience wanting more especially the way the film ended. The desire for a sequel was extremely high and, for the most part, the sequel doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />I had originally thought that Ip Man 2 wasn't able to capture the same amount of heart that the original film had, but I no longer believe that to be true. Ip Man 2 still has all the heart and emotion that the first film did. Everything from Ip Man realizing his friend Quan (Simon Yam) is brain damaged because of him to Ip Man trying to restore honor to the east by taking on a western boxer, the emotion is still there. It just isn't as strong or as powerful as it was in the first film. The same atmosphere is established quite easily, but the struggle to show the world that Wing Chun is a respectable martial art seems to take a backseat to other plot points that aren't necessarily less important but seem to take away from what made the first film so special.<br /><br />The sequel is still very solid and extremely entertaining. Any scene in the film featuring Sammo Hung is gold. His adamancy for the Chinese culture is half of his character's charm. The other half is split between him trying to provide for such a large family and the amazing action sequences he's a part of. The sole reason to see this film is for the Ip Man/Master Hung match that takes place on a table top. If you've seen S.P.L. Killzone, you know how fantastic a battle between these two can be. However, the Yen/Hung match in Ip Man 2 tops the one in Killzone though. Their encounter will be the thing fans will remember and be talking about the most after walking out of the theater and for good reason.<br /><br />Just a few sidenotes and nitpicks, the sound effects seemed to be off at times. The main occurrence being when Ip Man goes to meet Master Hung at his dojo after their pupils get into it for the second time. After Hung tells his pupils to leave, the sounds of their footsteps just didn't feel genuine and seemed like the sound was too loud or excessive or something. The film also features the fastest baby delivery ever in recent film memory. The woman goes into labor one scene and two scenes later, she's holding a baby. No mess and no 27 hours of labor? Why have an old fashioned pregnancy when you can just DVR it and fast forward through it later? Lastly, the film leaves you wanting even more than its predecessor did. Mostly due to the Bruce Lee tease featured at the end of the film.<br /><br />Ip Man 2 doesn't sweep you off your feet and smack you in the face quite as hard as its predecessor, but it's still very worthy of carrying the \\"Ip Man\\" name and is a joy to watch. If you enjoyed the hard-hitting action of the original film, then you'll have no problem being entertained by this sequel.etween him trying to provide for such a large family and the amazing action sequences he's a part of.

B0001CNRBG|5.0|I just love this movie. Even though it is celebrating an illicit relationship, I think the more important virtue displayed is friendship. Two people accidentially meet over a weekend and end up being long time friends, in spite of challenges in their individual personal lives. The true love isn't just romantic love or physical love, it's FRIENDSHIP.

1594202842|3.0|In the Center Ring, the Tiger!    In part, the American obsession with this book may well be that it offers itself to less-than-fully-engaged parents as an elaborately constructed excuse--an excuse for passive parenting; an excuse for low-achieving offspring--a chance to vindicate themselves through counter-argument.' See!' they may well say to themselves and each other. 'See the crazy life it takes to produce a Concert Master?' This allows them to rationalize their acceptance of mediocrity as excusable, even laudable, because they've chosen to let their children live a \\"normal,\\" \\"healthy,\\" \\"American\\" lifestyle. Not because, as Ms. Chua suggests, they prefer a yoga class and a latte to practice drills. Prefer to watch their own shows, or chat on the phone, while their children watch TV or play on the computers in their rooms. Do their children live their lives with cell phones hanging from their thumbs? Well, that's just part of a normal teen social scene.     Really??     I, too, am the mother of two girls, just about the ages of the Chua girls. I engage in a much more lively, connected, and--okay, I'll admit it--demanding style of parenting than most of my children's friends and schoolmates are experiencing. But I live in the Midwest, and am immersed in a culture of what I'll just go ahead and call lazy, self-indulgent parenting. I find no good excuse for this, but, following the release of this book, I've engaged in and overheard several conversations in which parents are latching on to Ms. Chua's philosophy and practice as a case in point to defend their own laissez faire approach. However, the self-indulgent, narrow-minded, and entitled attitudes evident in their children seem to contradict this defense and speak, instead, to the need for more Chua-like engagement, aggression, and tenacity in our child rearing practices.    Nevertheless, despite my disdain for the hands-off philosophy of so many of my parent peers, and my admiration of the Chua girls' (aren't they her girls, after all?) extreme successes notwithstanding, I do find this Tiger Mother's method over the top. And nothing more clearly supports this evaluation than Ms. Chua's enthusiastic embrace of the Suzuki method.     There's no doubt Dr. Suzuki created his method with the highest expectations of students in mind. He is famous for his qualification, \\"You do not have to practice every day:  You do not have to practice on the days you do not eat.\\" Tricky! But he is also insistent that teaching (for teachers AND parents) is about nurturing, and music is about bringing the world together. In exact contrast to this philosophy, Ms. Chua adopts the Suzuki method because mastery of the Suzuki Book repertoire inherently produces an outward measure of accomplishment, and the individual rate at which a student accomplishes each stage of technique can move her \\"ahead\\" of her peers. In other words, what resonates with the Tiger Mom is the opportunity for cut-throat competition among children--an anathema to those who understand Suzuki as a positive force.  Suzuki believes music encourages growth of the whole child. It seems to me forcing a child to go on with an audition (for an undesired \\"privilege\\") following a night-long bout with violent illness (was it really \\"food poisoning\\" -- or was it a physical manifestation of her rebellion?) denies even the existence of that whole child.     Whether raw confession or hyperbole, most of the scenes Ms. Chua presents are laced with a dry humor that often makes me cringe. I know this form of defense. It's the, \\"Oh, now, that didn't really hurt!\\" following a parent's smack, a little harder than was intended. It's the \\"Yes! That's me! The world's cruelest mother!\\" uttered in the hope that saying it out loud, with just the right satirical inflection, will convince others of the absurdity of this position. She doesn't convince me. I don't think she convinces herself, despite a book-length spin.     Finally, I can't help but wonder ifMs. Chua doesn't at last reveal the underlying motivation for this book toward its end, when she \\"comes clean\\" about her father. Her admission that her father was the \\"black sheep\\" of his family, and eventually broke with them for good, at first seems like a somewhat anticlimactic confession. So, her father was the less favored child and, for him, traditional Chinese parenting (while certainly inseparable from his laudable academic and career successes) destroyed any positive relationship--in fact, any relationship, at all--he might have had with his parents. Is this big? Despite Ms. Chua's deceptively simple presentation of this tragedy, recall that she admittedly idolizes her father, and that she also feels extremely defensive about her own family's Chinese identity. She needs to prove to her father, and for her father, that she is Chinese, despite her parent's sojourn through, and her own birth in, the Philippines. In this light, the motivation for this book--this testament to the notion that SHE did not fail, that she, against all odds, extended Chinese parenting through a third-generation immigrant family--emerges as the vindication of her father. Amy Chua, ever the conscientious and obedient Chinese daughter, has performed for her father. She has performed the role of Tiger Mother, whatever the hardships, whatever the consequences, whatever the effect on her instruments/daughters. And with this sensationalized book, she has moved her act into the center ring--because, as every would-be Concert Master grasps instinctively, a great performance deserves a large audience.

This is a wonderful up to date take on all those great elements that made music (particularly the British) underground so collectable and unique. I'm not talking the hits and memories dross, I'm hearing early Jethro Tull,Gravy Train & Andwella's Dream mixed with other seminal proto prog ideas from that time all with a modern production.   Keep up the great work guys it certainly makes a refreshing change to hear your LP rather than the usual shite thrust upon the unsuspecting young generations these days....

B0031YJFCQ|4.0|The thing I hate the most about book series is how you are left at the end craving for more or wondering, refreshingly not so with this book!  The author does not tie up every little bit in this book about the minor plots, but he does a really good job of tying up the story about Salander, concluding and investigating the events of the previous books.  At the end, you are actually left satisfied and sort of glad the story is over, not out of boredom, but out of knowing all is well.  I wish there were more books because they were entertaining, but not because I was left wanting more of this story.  Note that there is not a big new mystery like in the previous 2 books, but rather smaller mysteries to solve surrounding the big mystery the story picks up at.
B0034G4P7G|4.0|this is an excellent film but it is probably a little too much for the older viewer.  Not saying that it is not true but only saying that sometimes reality is more than the beholder can bear and this film tests the limits at times
B001NLKT60|4.0|The story in this book is worth getting through the first book.  There isn't as much gruesome unnecessary detail in this book, although he does fail to weave in some loose ends.  Note that this book basically stops partway through the story and you will be pretty much compelled to start the last book in the series asap. Be prepared for this.  You may want to go ahead and buy both books at once so the next one is ready waiting.
B002ZG983M|5.0|This movie is very different kind of 'super-hero' flick and provided quiet an entertainment. Everyone played their part well. Chloe Moretz completely stole the show (Angelina, it's OK to be jealous and you should be).    One warning though... The fact that there was enough of morbid violence, \\"F-bomb\\" was dropped A LOT, and that a high school girl bluntly acknowledges that she would \\"f--k the Kick-Ass' brains out\\" (actually a very funny line in the movie), kind of closes the gate to the younger viewers.    But otherwise, get popcorn, relax, enjoy, and don't forget to suspend your disbelief.

B0040JHF28|5.0|It's been a while since a notable soprano made a recording of Strauss's orchestral songs. The composer had a light, silvery lyric voice in mind when he composed many of these (his wife Pauline possessed such a voice, along with a notoriously shrewish temper), and she must have been quite accomplished, given the coloratura demands of, for example, \\"Ich wollt ein Struasslein binden,\\" the first item on the program. Diana Damrau handles it beautifully, moving through the tricky melisma with a steady, beautiful tone and winning manner. I haven't heard her in person, but if the microphones place her front and center, there's no issue of such a light soprano having to ride over Strauss's lush orchestral writing. She makes a good deal out of the poetry, too, which is welcome; I think this is the most expressive singing, so far as language goes, since Schwarzkopf's famous Strauss collection under Szell four decades ago.<br /><br />Damrau has emerged as a star, particularly on stage, where she is said to be a compelling actress; on disc, however, I've tended to find her coy and mannered, expending too much effort on histrionics. That isn't so here. Under the expert guidance of Christian Thielemann, who has made a name for himself conducting Strauss operas around the world, the singer is bright and forward but respectful of limits. It's hard for a coloratura soprano to sound as serious as a richer voice would, but she overcomes this innate difficulty well. I wasn't as emotionally involved as with notable Straussians form the past like Schwarzkopf, Gueden, and Della Casa, yet in her lighter way Damrau is quite successful, particularly if you are listening for ravishing sound from voice and orchestra, which has certainly been supplied by EMI's excellent engineering.<br /><br />Twenty-two songs is a generous number -- too generous, perhaps, since a long stretch of Strauss's luscious melodies turns into musical marzipan after a wile. But taken eight or nine at a time, they are delightful, and all the chestnuts are here. Damrau joins Felicity Lott and Renee Fleming as a leading exponent of this repertoire among recent singers. Among the men, I'd plump for Steve Davislim, although the great Fritz Wunderlich also recorded a handful, taken from radio broadcasts as I recall, not studio sessions.ightful, and all the chestnuts are here.

B00000JPYQ|5.0|This album just flat out rocks! I have all of the songs on this album in different compilations. However, having them all together on this album is incredible. I can't stop listening and I find when Strangers is playing in my car, I have to wait for the current song to finish before I will turn the car off. I just can't turn off any of these tracks, they are too good.<br /><br />I feel it is worth mentioning that I typically am not a big fan of live albums. I find the sound quality is a lot of times not as good as the studio. This album is different. In between songs the crowd can be heard, but during the track all you hear is that sweet guitar playing that only MS can provide. Phil's vocals are great and the keyboards sound great behind MS.<br /><br />Overall, I can't give this album a high enough rating. It has inspired me as a beginner musician and just gets me totally amped up as soon as that first chord is strummed in Hot 'N' Ready. If you are a fan of UFO then you need this album. If you are a fan of 70's rock then you need this album. If you are a fan of live albums then you need this album. To sum it up, you need this album. Stop reading and start rocking out.<br /><br />On a final note, this is the best version of Rock Bottom available. Get it!

B000000OE7|5.0|Queen's fourteenth, and final, studio album Made in Heaven was released in November of 1995.<br />After lead singer Freddie Mercury's death in 1991 from AIDS, the surviving members of Queen (bass player John Deacon, drummer Roger Taylor and guitarist Brian May) worked on different projects like The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert in 1992, Brian May's first solo album Back to the Light being released in 1992/93 and Roger Taylor's third solo album Happiness released in 1994. In between all of this, the surviving Queen members also saw time to create a final studio album which had Freddie vocal tracks recorded between 1980 and 1991. Would this album be heaven or would it be Hell. Read on and find out (as I did when I bought the CD on street date in 1995).<br />We open the album with the fitting \\"It's a Beautiful Day\\" which was written and recorded by Freddie during The Game sessions in 1980 and finished between 1993 and 1995. Next is the title cut which was first recorded and released on Freddie's first solo album Mr. Bad Guy in 1985. Taylor, May and Deacon re-recorded it with Mercury's original piano and vocals to make it a Queen track. Brian's bottleneck solo is superb here and John's simple but effective bass playing is stellar and Roger's drumming is thundering. Next is the gospel-sounding \\"Let Me Live\\" and featured Freddie, Roger and Brian on lead vocal with each singing a verse. Next is the last track Freddie and Brian wrote together called \\"Mother Love\\". This was I believe the last vocal Freddie recorded before his death. Brian sang the last verse since Mercury wasn't able to do it and also did a superb guitar solo on his Parker Fly guitar (instead of the normal Red Special). Next is a re-recording of the 1989 Miracle era B-side called \\"My Life Has Been Saved\\". Written by John Deacon, this song is stellar and the re-recorded version had Freddie's vocal sound normal whereas on the original it was echoey but great version.<br />The song drastically changed was \\"I Was Born to Love You\\". Originally recorded on Freddie's Mr. Bad Guy album as an 80s disco-type tune, the three surviving Queen members transform the song into a majestic hard rocker with Brian's stellar solos, Roger's exciting drums and John supplying the bass. Next is \\"Heaven for Everyone\\" which Roger taylor first recorded with The Cross (his other band, where he was lead singer and rhythm guitarist instead of drummer) and re-qorked for Made in Heaven. Freddie's vocals are from the 1987 Shove It sessions. \\"Too Much Love Will Kill You\\" is next and a great power ballad composed by Brian plus Frank Musker and Elizabeth Lamers and intended for The Miracle album with Freddie on vocals but was scrapped. A solo version with Brian on vocals was released on 1993's Back to the Light. This re-recording is superb. Next is one of the tracks recorded after Innuendo called \\"You Don't Fool Me\\" and reminds me of Hot Space era Queen. Next is the last track Freddie wrote for Queen called \\"A Winter's Tale\\". This ballad is such a beautiful track and a steallar cut. We close with \\"It's a Beautiful Day (Reprise)\\" which starts out like the intro of the album but then turns into a rocker with samples of Freddie, Seven Seas of Rhye over a thundering rock riff. Then the \\"Yeah\\" from \\"Action This Day\\" brings us to the 22 minute hidden track which is a great piece and feels like one is going to Heaven.<br />The Made in Heaven album did huge in most of the world (#1 in the UK and best selling album in Europe). Sadly here in the US, it only reached #54 and achieved Gold in US sales two months after its release (the US was in grunge and gangsta rap land at the time).<br />RECOMMENDED!Love You\\".

B003WE9TU8|5.0|The stories are excellent, the pace brilliant and the depth and imagination used is breathtaking.  My one issue with the book is I wanted more, more and more.
B000FC2PKG|5.0|I LOVED this book. I am so happy I bought my Kindle back in August of 2010. If it was not for my Kindle I may never had discovered this great writer, Lisa Gardner. I picked up her book \\"Alone\\" after seeing it at the top of best selling books for Kindle. The price was an attractive $0.99.<br /><br />The story is just fantastic. Action, suspense, and drama. This story has it all. I also like the fact that it was pretty believable. I like to read a story that makes sense and could actually happen. The story kept me guessing and was not predictable like many books I read.<br /><br />The characters were well written. The story fast-paced and non-confusing to follow. The book was written with intelligence and wit. This was a well thought out tale.<br /><br />I will be checking out more books by Lisa Gardner in the near future.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|A great collection of short stories that are enjoyable even if they show their age. Don't expect the intricacies and plot twists of modern story tellers as the stories are generally straight forward and to the point.<br /><br />I enjoyed the stories in this book but some readers may be surprised at their simplicity given the many t.v. and film adaptations of the characters.
B001GM28HO|5.0|Quite impressive, for all 15 songs in the album (I guess I got a south american export version with Disco Heaven as #15).
B000XUBFE2|4.0|I decided to start writing reviews since I always read through them before buying a book. This was an interesting and well-written book. I read it a year or so ago, but it still stands out as being creative and engaging.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Good suspense novel...hard keeping track of the names but, then again, not to many swedish names are \\"Smith\\" or \\"Jones\\".  Reader beware though, if you read one book you've got to read the other two (also very good).
B003EYVXTG|5.0|Neither contrived nor manipulating as in previous Sundance fare,Winter's Bone is heavily imbued with atmosphere, shot on location,drenched with a sense of foreboding,where mythic,dark forces bleed from poverty and criminal drug activity.The Odyssean story's meaning derives subtly from a steady, near-inconspicuous accumulation of nuances from the life of its main character,Ree Dolly(Jennifer Lawrence).Based on country noir,Daniell Woodrell's novel, set in marginalized crystal-meth manufacturing communities in the Missouri Ozarks.Debra Granik depicts this bleak, forebidding landscape with a fine sense of individual damaged lives going about their business,casually observing the daily habits of its characters,with what dignity they retain.     When her father jumps bail,17 year old Ree faces losing the home put up as his bond, where she lives with her invalid mother and younger siblings.She teaches them how to shoot,skin squirrels and cook.She teaches them to not ask for anything:\\" Don't ask what ought to be offered\\".She has to track her father down in the harsh environs of the Ozark Mountains,trailer-rash country in the clapperboarded shacks,rusting car-lots and broken-down machinery of the rubbish-strewn back-yards.She hacks through taboo-filled habits of silence,menace and threat.Undeterred and with a little help from her scary uncle,Teardrop(John Hawkes),who saves her life from Milton Thump's gang.Hawkes is outstanding.Initially angry with Ree,pretending he didn't know what happened to her father,when she comes for his help,to being protector and head of her family,setting himself on an inevitable path of destruction.Ree risks her life to save her home and keep her family intact.Jennifer Lawrence shines with moral incandescence,her determination to find out the truth,tested by dire circumstances and dirt-poor poverty.The cinematography brings out the dark undertones.The film is lightened by the story-telling ballads of the folk music that is played.Most of the extras were non-acting locals from the area.All the settings are real.Rivetting.

B003X2O6KW|1.0|This record is a crystallization of what's wrong with popular music at large.

B0040UAYI4|5.0|For those who have played FPS games such as counterstrike (CS) Tac Ops or any other of the assorted games related to computers that required a keyboard and did not use the format related to the controllers for PS3 this product evens the playing field. Your skills can be tapped without being frustrated by learning the controls of the ps3, everything is seamless and ready to install.  Extremely satisfied thus far.  Highly recommend to those who wish to dominate COD Black Ops who had skills in keyboard related FPS games.
B0019M06JS|5.0|This is truly a masterwork; yesterday night I've seen her live in Milan (Italy) at the Blue Note and that concert was a tribute to Jobim and the brazilian musical tradition; \\"A Ra (The frog)\\", \\"Falsa baiana\\", \\"The girl from Ipanema\\", \\"Desafinado\\", \\"Chega de Saudade\\", \\"Minha saudade\\" and \\"The more I see you\\" (most of which have been performed live yesterday) are my favorite.  I love her music, and I recommend all of her albums, both her instrumental and vocal ones.
0307272702|5.0|When science journalist Gary Taubes released his long-awaited book Good Calories Bad Calories in September 2007 some five years after penning his infamous New York Times Magazine column entitled \\"What If It's All Been A Big Fat Lie?\\", that 600+ page book bucking conventional wisdom on diet, fitness and health quite literally rocked the nutritional science world to its core as deeply entrenched axioms regarding the way obesity and chronic diseases are treated was seriously questioned for the first time in a long time with the historical science to back it up. Taubes was lauded by many respected professionals in the medical community (like Dr. Andrew Weil) for his simple thesis that excessive carbohydrate consumption leads to higher blood sugar and insulin levels which is what is making people fat and sick. Even still, trident defenders of the low-fat, high-carb diet laughed at this assertion that carbs are to blame and they strenuously attacked Taubes for daring to speak out against what they think is an essential fuel for the body. Taubes remained undeterred and was invited to speak at medical conferences and universities all across North America.<br /><br />However, there was one major problem with Good Calories Bad Calories that most laypeople like myself who read it universally agreed-that book was extremely dense and much too difficult for the general public to comprehend. And Taubes will be the first to admit that book was not necessarily intended for the consumer, but it was specifically written for doctors, nurses, nutritionists, registered dietitians, and other medical professionals to arm them with the scientific evidence supporting the use of carbohydrate-restriction as a therapeutic means for treating their patients with obesity and chronic disease. In hindsight, it was definitely the right book to put out first because those medical personnel who are working on the front lines of health are in desperate need of education about the detrimental impact that excessive carbohydrate consumption is having on the health of the tens of millions of patients dealing with excessive weight, diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and so much more. But the time has definitely come for Taubes to offer up a more simplified book that would convey the concepts of Good Calories Bad Calories without all the confusing medical jargon and scientific overtones that may have muddled the message for those of us who are not science-minded. That precisely why he wrote Why We Get Fat And What To Do About It.<br /><br />Honestly, I've been begging Gary Taubes to write this book for the past four years! The readers at my \\"Livin' La Vida Low-Carb\\" blog were flooding me with e-mails stating how much they appreciated Good Calories Bad Calories but they couldn't share it with their Aunt Suzie or Grandpa Joe because the book would never get read. I passed along this feedback to Gary who I have had the privilege of befriending the past few years and after several hundred requests I think he finally got the message. Thankfully his publisher Knopf also agreed it was a good idea and decided to give Taubes a sequel to his 2007 bestseller! And Why We Get Fat was certainly worth the wait.<br /><br />For those who read Good Calories Bad Calories and understood it, the information in this new book will be old hat to you-but shared in a more user-friendly style that will reach a much wider audience with the same message intact. Why We Get Fat is split into two distinct books-\\"Book 1' in the first 80 pages of the book is all about why obesity exists and explains how we got into this crisis to begin with while \\"Book 2' over the final 120 pages gives a little more practical instruction on what makes us fat (or not) and what people who carry around a few extra pounds can do to eliminate the excessive weight. My favorite chapter in the book is Chapter 18 \\"The Nature Of A Healthy Diet\\" where Taubes brilliantly counters the three main arguments we hear from physicians and so-called health \\"experts\\" about why low-carb diets are not an optimally nutritional way to eat:<br /><br />1. They're a scam because they promote weight loss without eating less.<br />2. They're unbalanced because they cut out an entire nutrient category (carbohydrate).<br />3. They're high-fat diets, especially saturated fat, which causes heart disease.<br /><br />If you believe that any of these statements are true, then simply turn to page 173 in Why We Get Fat to see how Taubes slices and dices these common myths about livin' la vida low-carb as only he can. As my friend Tom Naughton who created a fantastic documentary film on this subject called FAT HEAD would say, \\"We've all been fed a load of bologna!\\" Indeed we have and Taubes is doing his part to expose this farce so that those who struggle with why they got fat can figure out precisely what they need to do about it once and for all.<br /><br />And therein lies the beauty of this amazing book that is the must-read health book of 2011! We asked for it and Gary Taubes has delivered. The really cool thing about Why We Get Fat that was noticeably absent in Good Calories Bad Calories was direction about how to eat the way he's prescribing. That's where the \\"Following Through\\" chapter in the back of the book along with sample menus comes in especially handy. Although Taubes says \\"this is not a diet book,\\" you can't really leave people hanging without some measure of instruction. So he enlisted the assistance of several medical practitioners and researchers using carbohydrate-restriction with patients like Dr. Eric Westman, Dr. Jeff Volek, Dr. Mary Vernon, Dr. Stephen Phinney, Dr. Jay Wortman, Drs. Michael and Mary Dan Eades, and others to provide helpful tips to make this low-carb lifestyle change a permanent one. It's these kind of lessons that helped me personally shed 180 pounds in 2004 and to continue eating this way ever since to make me healthier than I ever thought would be possible on a high-fat, moderate protein, low-carb way of life!\\" about why low-carb diets are not an optimally nutritional way to eat:    1.

0545265355|4.0|I had just read Stephen King's early story, The Long Walk,\\" (published under his pseudonym, Richard Bachman,) so to go from that to The Hunger Games was pretty interesting.  I probably don't need to read Running Man.  So these are all essentially the same premise, and the excitement is in the details, the characters, the rules of the game.  Even though this trilogy is clearly written for teens, I was completely immersed in it.  It made me feel like a teen again, frankly.  Really fun. The writing starts off pretty great, for what it is, then slightly deteriorates by the third book, but not enough to make me put it down.  All page turners.
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|One of the best films ever made - the acting, the writing, the subject matter - timeless.  To the younger crowd, look past the '70's fashions and hairstyles and sink your teeth into this prophetic statement that is STILL currently unspooling around us globally on a daily basis.
B004529NKC|4.0|This movie is just about everything I don't like in a film. It's trite, it's stupid, it's got an insanely dumb plot, two-dimensional characters, and a checklist of cliches a mile long. It's a wonder it doesn't collapse in on its own pretension and turn into a black hole. And yet... I rather liked it. Oh, it's far from a great movie. But it has a certain amount of charm.    The plot, such as it is, centers around two rival dance troupes. They have silly names and call themselves \\"houses\\". One is lead by the handsome and charismatic Luke while the other is lead by the handsome and charismatic Julian. We know Julian is Eeeeevil because he wears black and has a sinister look about him. They take their dancing so seriously I kept having flashbacks to the \\"South Park\\" episode \\"You Got F'd in the A\\".    Into their world wanders a boy with the unfortunate nickname of Moose. Apparently he was in the other films, where I sincerely hope his nickname gets explained. He's played by Adam G Sevani, a very attractive, talented young dancer who gives the distinct impression of a gay person trying to play straight and falling short. He's cute and charming and very good at dancing.    He gets recruited into Luke's little dance troupe and we soon find out that Luke's home/rehearsal space is about to be foreclosed on. Thankfully there's a dance competition coming up soon and the prize is $100,000. It's astonishing to me that could possibly be enough to cover a mortgage on a large space in New York City, but whatever.    The plot goes from there with dancing, betrayal, dancing, romance, dancing and dancing, with only enough plot as needed to move the film forward. Really it reminded me of one of those porn films that pretends to have a plot when really all the audience wants is for the movie to do what it's meant to do. It's much the same here. I would have been far more interested in two hours of dancing footage and zero plot.    Speaking of the dancing, oh, goodness. Yes, it's quite impressive. It is what makes the movie worth seeing, and it really is worth seeing just for that. People do things I didn't know where physically possible. It was frankly astonishing what some of these people can do with their bodies.    But I do have an objection with much of the dancing. There's several scenes where we see dancing but it's so heavily edited it's very hard to tell exactly what's going on and to follow the action. That's a shame, because there's some real talent, but the camera doesn't take enough time to showcase it. This is less of a problem toward the end of the film, but it's a major issue at the start.    Ignoring that and the really, really stupid plot, this is a fun little movie. If you can just put your brain into neutral and coast along, you'll be just fine.
B002GZQY6Q|3.0|In Absentia is my all-time fav album. Deadwing was very good, too. Fear of a Blank Planet wasn't great at first until I listened through it a few more times and fully realized the incredible, beautiful, deep work it was. It's sister album, Nil Recurring, extended the awesomeness and satisfied the people who thought the initial album was too short, or had too-few songs. The music videos made it even better.    Anyways, The Incident now comes along. I'm not feeling the \\"concept\\" of this title. There are about 4 or so really good works of art in this title. The 10 other or so tracks seriously sounds like lazy filler with too many repeated riffs and droning content that doesn't have that ambient feeling PT is good at when they're not rocking out.    I've listened through this album 10+ times and still feel the same.    I'm not sure how these issues arose. Bad weed? lol.     Reading other reviews it seems many of their fans like the album quite well, so I dunno.    BTW: a transfer of the DVD \\"Somewhere But Not Here\\" to Blu-ray'd be very sweet, PT!    Thanks for reading. I have a feeling their next title will be amazing, though. I crave its coming.     PT fan for life.
B001IYCMNA|1.0|I am a System/Network Administrator with 39 years of IT experience, over 15 years of network experience, and almost two years of daily experience using the WAP4410N (version 1), and it is without a doubt the most unreliable wireless device I have ever used. My 2008 $49 Linksys WRT54GS router at home is far more reliable and never caused me a single access problem in almost three years of use.     Without any notice the WAP4410N loses contact with the LAN and will not pass traffic from it to the LAN, so the wireless device will make a wireless connection to the access point, but it will never receive an IP Address from the DHCP server.     The process is random and can happen anytime. All of the fixes that are offered over the years have only delayed the process. The loss of traffic flow can happen many times over a single day or even days on end.  Powering the device via AC Power or POE has no effect. Sometimes a reboot will fix the problem, sometimes a hard reboot (pull power) will fix the problem, sometimes nothing will fix the problem and I have to wait for the problem to disappear on its own.     What connects the WAP4410N to the LAN side has no effect, because I have had it connected to different devices (routers, switches), different brands (AdTran, Dell, and Cisco), different speeds (100Mbps, 1Gbps) and even a brand new Cisco 2960-S switch ratched down to 100Mbps/Full Duplex has had no effect.     I have installed every version of firmware that has been released, tried every configuration change (including using SSH to access the CLI and making changes to the configuration that way to bypass the web interface), and I have read every post including a massive two year old post on the Cisco Community forum with well over 1,800 entries all reporting the same problem.  Cisco released version 2 of the hardware last summer/fall with a crystal on the LAN port to fix a jitter problem with some 1Gbps switches, but the people who tried version 2 all reported that they had the same problem.   Even crazier the problem can go away for two or more weeks or even for up to four months and then one day it pops up again.   I highly recommend that you don't purchase this product, unless you want pain in your professional life.   As you can tell it happened again today, and this incident was the last straw. I will start a search for a reliable access point tomorrow. I will have to replace four (4) of these devices and even though the rest of our network uses Cisco for the core, it is very unlikely I will replace these access points with Cisco access points, at least not at this price point. If you decide to purchase the WAP4410N, my remark would be \\"Caveat emptor\\"  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE Wednesday, August 31, 2011:  I updated our four WAP4410N Access Points to the latest firmware version (2.0.4.2) last week as recommended by Diana from the Cisco Small Business Team and one of access points failed this afternoon in the same identical manner that they all have been failing over the last three years.  I have sent an e-mail to the Cisco Small Business Team and I will post a follow-up if there is a resolution or a lack of resolution to this problem in September.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE Thursday, January 5, 2012:  This is my final follow-up on the WAP4410N. This last Fall (September 2011) Cisco replaced all of our WAP4410N hardware version 1 devices with version 2 devices. We continued to have problems with all of the WAP4410N devices until I changed their parameters as follows:  Force LAN Port Speed to 100M:  Enabled  Wireless Network Mode:  G Only  Key Renewal:  36000  All other parameters are set to factory default and the devices all have with a Static IP Addresses.  I have to say that Cisco attempted to solve the problem and they where very nice about replacing all of our hardware version 1 devices with version 2 devices, but finally the only way to stablize the devices was to limit their wireless capability to G only and limit their wired interface speed to 100Mbps.  The WAP4410N access points are all connected to Cisco 2960-S switches, which are 1Gbps switches, but in the past they have been connected to Dell and AdTran switches and they have always had the same problem.  I do have to thank Cisco for making an effort to fix the problem, but at this time we have budgeted to replace all of the WAP4410N access points with an Enterprise controller based system and will donate the WAP4410N access points to charity.
6305280762|5.0|I like the start of the movie when it opens and Thanks Firefighters for the work they do,While the movie is long and drawn out at times,the Cast is a Who's Who of Hollywood Heavyweights at the Time. Steve McQueen And Paul Newman both do a tremendous job in their respective roles,While the movie is from the \\"Disaster Era\\" of movies it is still worth watching for the Action sequences and effects from the time and the characters. You even have Robert Wagner and O.J. Simpson(Irony?).
0452287022|5.0|This is a wonderful story full of interesting characters. Greit was a strong girl with a mind of her own. She found a way to live with her unhappiness inspite of the circumstances. The story line between her and the master painter was unusual. The families were described clearly and it felt like you were there watching everything. This author has a way of pulling the reader right into the story. I love the descriptions of the painter's complicated family. I have read the book twice (audio) just to be sure I heard everything. It was just a fabulous the second time. I have suggested the book to many people I know that love to read.
B001GKJ2DY|2.0|I like good chick flicks that critics pan. I just like a good fun romantic story, I can't help it. So I expected to like this movie but I was disappointed. If I had seen it in the theaters instead of at home on my DVR and couldn't fast-forward through most of the songs like I did, I probably would have impaled myself on my soda straw.<br /><br />The songs are way too numerous and often don't fit with the story. It's like they had a checklist of ABBA songs they wanted to cram in this thing so they just stuck them in as often as possible no matter what. At the end of the movie, there are four in a row, count 'em, FOUR songs, with about two lines of dialogue in there. They just roll them off just 'cause. To be fair, most of the singing was pretty good (except for Pierce Brosnan, bless his heart for trying), and it helped when they piped in ABBA-sounding background vocals to all but cover up the movie star who was trying to sing lead, but I just couldn't take one more scene watching Meryl Streep flail and roll around the set in rolled-up overalls. To be fair again, she's not a singer so she didn't know what to do with herself while singing except said jumping around, plus some head-scratching gesticulations, but it was painful to watch regardless.<br /><br />The female characters were ridiculous. If you go by Sophie and her friends, or Donna and her friends, all women scream and do some ridiculous show tune or secret girl club handshake of some kind when we reunite after having been apart; and we engage in over-dramatic Ya-Ya-esque behavior the rest of the time. One scene with the mom and her friends sounded literally like hens, they were doing so much whooping and weirdness. I found it embarrassing and unflattering to our gender. I know no females (no human beings really) who act like this or who would want friends who do. Why does Hollywood do it?<br /><br />I watched the whole thing mainly out of curiosity, and stubbornness because I'd be darned if I'd invested an hour of my life into this thing without seeing the end. I liked most of the characters, sure, but they were mostly amusing circus-types and not people I cared about. We didn't have time to connect with them because instead of going into character development, they were forever singing something instead, and the song rarely lent itself to the story.<br /><br />That said, if you like the following:<br /><br />*Watching movie stars do mediocre karaoke covers of ABBA songs every couple minutes.<br />*Women who whoop and holler and do lots of girl bonding over alcohol and sing encouraging songs to each other over (and under) the bathroom stall door.<br />*Seeing old women sing in sparkly 1970s jumpsuits and platform boots to pretend they're the disco version of the Supremes.<br />*Greek scenery.<br />*Fake old photos of Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth elaborately dressed as hippies.<br />*Seeing old people kiss a lot.<br /><br />...then you will really enjoy this movie.<br /><br />Right, so given that list, I did not much enjoy this movie. It seems like it was way more fun for the people to make the movie than for the rest of us to watch it. At least I sure hope it was, or else all those poor people were pretty miserable that whole time. If you want an indulgent-fun chick flick, go watch Leap Year instead.s thing without seeing the end. I liked most of the characters, sure, but they were mostly amusing circus-types and not people I cared about.

That said, if you like the following:    *Watching movie stars do mediocre karaoke covers of ABBA songs every couple minutes.  *Women who whoop and holler and do lots of girl bonding over alcohol and sing encouraging songs to each other over (and under) the bathroom stall door.  *Seeing old women sing in sparkly 1970s jumpsuits and platform boots to pretend they're the disco version of the Supremes.  *Greek scenery.  *Fake old photos of Pierce Brosnan and Colin Firth elaborately dressed as hippies.  *Seeing old people kiss a lot.    ...then you will really enjoy this movie.    Right, so given that list, I did not much enjoy this movie. It seems like it was way more fun for the people to make the movie than for the rest of us to watch it. At least I sure hope it was, or else all those poor people were pretty miserable that whole time. If you want an indulgent-fun chick flick, go watch Leap Year instead.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I bought these headphones for my husband to use with his Playstation 3 game, Black Ops.  He loves them.  They give him surround sound that improves the quality of his game play.  They also have great sound and are comfortable to wear, even over extended play time.  There is a mute switch for the mic so that our home sounds are not heard by others.  And when he is using the headset, he can mute the TV sound if the rest of the family does not want to hear him playing.  It's great.

Since my surprise is that the packing was the common one that salio in The United States that though it is true that I not tape-worm since I have the European edition was not for neda what was waiting is not definitively the product that they offer in the photo very badly.    Saludos, estoy un poco desilucionado ya que pense que el disco me me iba a llegar era el Digipack que aparece en la foto. pues mi sorpresa es que el empaque era el comun que salio en Estados Unidos que si bien es cierto que yo no lo tenia ya que tengo la edicion Europea no era para neda lo que esperaba no es definitivamente el producto que ofrecen en la foto muy mal.

B00006L7XQ|4.0|I was a young man back in the mid 1990's when Cash started covering many of the bands I liked. My friends and myself ignored him, and occasionally a few of my friends even laughed at his musical efforts (I'm thankful I didn't do that). Owning many of Johnny's recordings now I have come to realize that we were just dumb young fools. Some of my friends were wrapped up in our metal shred guitars, and some were absorbed by the technical aspects of Jazz and classical (both fine art forms). What my friends and I failed to understand is that most people listen to music for what it does for them. Young stupid musicians often don't give enough respect to the novice music audience. It is the heart and emotion that Johnny Cash delivers to your table with this recording. Regardless if he wrote the song or not he delivers a performance of the song by making it his own. His frail voice echoing over the speakers like a grandfather trying to impart wisdom to a younger generation. In his cover of \\"Hurt\\" a chill went up my spine as he sung, \\"You can have it all. My empire of dirt.\\" Yet, you take away an understanding from Johnny that is different then you do from Trent Reznor (the songs original writer and performer). The video for hurt shows his \\"house of cash\\" and essentially his empire as he sings those words. I came away with the feeling that he understood that what we many of us treasure in this world is glorified dirt. There are some songs I like better from the original performer, that being said there isn't a dud on this recording. I give it four starts just because I'm partial to American V. For me it's not quite as good as that recording.
B002ZG999U|3.0|This moviw is one of thoses I will watch once. Although I may run across it in a year or two and watch again. It was a good way to spend some time escaping, but not the type I'd be urged to watch over and over. Not a bad movie, just one of those that didn't have the plot to add to the action. The action was great... the story line left something to be desired.

0553584537|3.0|[[ASIN:0553584537 Alone: A Novel of Suspense]]<br /><br />Lots of twists and turns and some big surprises here. I did like the book, but it contained a little too much emphasis on sex for my taste. On the other hand, there is plenty of incest and pedophilia to go around in the story and that explains it. I can't figure out why Detective D.D. Warren is the heroine as she only appears a few times in the book; Bobby Dodge was a much more interesting character. I'm sure I will try the next book in the series but I hope the author doesn't continue to use sex in every plot.

0307266303|4.0|This was a fun book to read.  The author's descriptions really bring the characters to life. He also does a great job of telling the story; factual but lighthearted and with a great sense of humour.  My only complaint is that the ending felt a little abrupt.  I would read this again.
B003UESJH4|5.0|I like all the books and movies showing a person overcoming bad circumstances, but the subject alone does not make a good book or a great movie. You also need style and talent. The King's speech is stylish and has loads of talent, including good music and great editing.<br />This may be your first and last chance to root for a king: don't miss it.<br />In his time, young Bertie, the father of Queen Elisabeth, was often considered like an idiot because of his speech impediment. His older brother Prince Edward was loved by the public. He had a talent for remembering names and he was a leader in men's fashion. People who knew him more intimately described Edward as vulgar, callous, selfish and a drunk. I think that for the first time in the history of movies, we see here the future Duke of Windsor other self, not the man with the aura of the romantic king who resigned to marry the woman he loved, but the unpleasant self-centered jerk.<br />We get justice for Bertie (George VI) who was a decent, courageous man. It is a bonus to a great movie.<br />Finally, Bertie has a voice.<br /><br />On the technical point of view, this is a beautiful movie: check this interview of the cinematographer Danny Cohen<br />[...]

B000IU3XTM|5.0|I never tire of this album.  It cuts to the core.  9 Crimes is probably the most dark, depressing song I have ever heard, but in a way that most can relate to.  I just wish Damien Rice share all of his unreleased material, which contains enough songs for multiple albums, some of which is his best work (ex. \\"Bottom Shelf\\").
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I'm writing this review after having owned the e5 for over 6 months. I contracted audiophilia by purchasing a pair of Grado Sr80i's and after hearing the pure bliss that flows out of them, I have been looking for ways to upgrade the sound quality that was entering my ears without shelling out serious coin. After reading reviews about different headphone amplifiers and researching the other ones available at this price point( which are virtually non-existent) I decided to go for the E5. Thanks to my Prime account, which I got for free with Amazon Student, the E5 arrived 2 days later. For the price I paid for it, I was quite impressed with the attention to detail in the packaging. However, within a few days, the E5 mysteriously stopped working. I sent it back to Amazon and immediately purchased another one.   Here are my impressions of this little guy.   It absolutely does improve the sound quality of your music. Even without using the bass-booster switch, bass sounds much tighter and more refined, definitely not boomy and muddy as it does when equalized through the iPod's EQ. The bass-booster switch is a nice bonus. Highs are clearer and brighter and instrument separation is also more pronounced. The soundstage and imaging is also improved, although you will not notice much a difference if you are playing low-quality mp3's- 320k's and lossless files gain the most from this little quy.  The battery life is somewhat lacking, probably lasts about 12 hours and the unit would double its usefulness if it had included a auto-off feature. I use the E5 when I fall asleep to music at night and I find myself charging it every couple of days. In addition, the E5 has survived me rolling over and sleeping on it at night countless times.   One thing I did notice was that it was subject to a small but incredibly annoying amount of interference from my iPhone.  In summary, an incredible value that will noticeably improve your listening experience and lead you further down the slippery slope of audiophilia. Do yourself a favor though and buy a line-out cable to bypass the iPod's crappy amplifier.
B00009ATIX|5.0|I highly reccommend this movie if you like a thoughtful mysterious  stories. In the same vein as Moon, silent running, 2001; this movie  provokes thought about why we are here and what lies beyond our  limited sight. Interesting premise and unwinding: the movie definitely  begs for multiple viewings to catch many of the details missed on the   first pass. I had read about this movie in entertainment weekly when  it premiered but as I recall it disappeared fast. That is too bad as   I rank this as one of George clooneys better performances.  Solaris beckons........  Remember James cameron? He of titanic, abyss, terminator, avatar fame?  I cannot say he has ever dissappointed me wit hone of his movies..

I have always loved animals, and shuddered to think I killed a thinking, loving mammal for food.  Now I know.  The industry aspect of our food culture threatens the cultures of South America and Europe.  Especially in France, the land of small farmers, markets, and artisan foods, is their culture threatened by our artificially cheap food.  We export and undercut their prices and economy.  If the GOP really wants to cut the national debt, one huge item is the price support for the glut of corn.

The best way I can describe the music is a mixture of folk/bluegrass/rock/country.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|After seeing commericals recommending The Pacific and hearing different comments from friends that watched, I had to purchase it.  After watching this miniseries, I hated for each DVD to end.  I gave up reading and watching regular TV until I finished watching the complete miniseries.  I never could imagine how brutal WWII's fighting was in the Pacific until I watched it.  It was almost too realistic for me.  I had a hard time watching but then I had to see what was going on.  I love reading about American history.  This miniseries brought out many stories that I would have missed.  I would highly recommend The Pacific for adults only.  It is too brutal for small kids to watch.
B002RWKSII|4.0|This is a really fascinating combination of Brian Wilson and George Gershwin.  There are times that it feels a true collaboration between the two artists, even though they are separated by generations.  The Porgy and Bess songs are truly fantastic, which just shows the genius of the Gershwins' music and lyric writing abilities.  The Rhapsody in Blue is quoted throughout the album, masterfully tying disjointed themes together.  There are two treats on the album- one that succeeds more than the other.  Brian Wilson was granted permission to finish two songs that due to George's untimely death were left undone.  One truly feels like the lost Gershwin song, the other feels like an odd mix of Gershwin's melodic thoughts, but ultimately is too strong of Brian Wilson's hand.  All in all, this is a great album, well thought out.
B00005JLCI|5.0|Okay, I am going to let other people review the movie itself. What I want to do is help you decide which format to watch, although you might not have much choice.    I love laserdiscs, and am really doing this review for laserdisc fans. So, to begin, no you do not need to upgrade from laserdisc to DVD for this movie. The differences are very small. The DVD, as usual, is slightly crisper but only slightly. The laserdisc is very crisp too. The DVD version is somewhat darker, with blacks a bit blacker but not a big deal. The laserdisc has more natural skin color, and is brighter and whiter -- not pale! It is not the least washed out, it is just that the DVD has a gray tone to it that is actually a bit unpleasant and is the main reason that I personally will not buy the DVD until I must. There are also minor differences in framing, with the laserdisc having a slightly wider aspect ratio. Not a huge difference, but the framing on the laserdisc is a little better. Anyway, laserdisc lovers take heart. You can save your money for some other purchase.    On VHS, there is the widescreen version and the \\"modified for TV\\" version. Unless you have neither a DVD player nor a laserdisc player, there is no need to get the widescreen version. It is not as nice as the DVD or the laserdisc. Not as crisp, and the colors are uneven. Typical VHS flaws. However, if you like to watch your movies on a normal old fashioned TV and don't like letterboxing, then you might consider the \\"modified for TV\\" cropping. It has its flaws but the movie is still very enjoyable and in some instances the emotional power is heightened by the \\"close up\\" nature of the cropping. I would not want it to be my only copy, but it has its virtues.    There you have it. The choice is yours. This is a great production of HAMLET. Watch it whatever way you like.
0307454541|2.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo came to me highly recommended from a trusted friend so I was looking forward to starting, and enjoying, the book. After I was about 100 pages into this long novel I decided that everyone deserves a do-over and I pardoned my friend. I didn't have the heart to drop the book, so I trudged along and about half-way through, the story eventually picked up to the point where I was no longer bored.<br /><br />There's a lot gong on in The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo and it takes a long time for the story to go anywhere. Very briefly, Henrik Vanger is an elderly Swedish businessman who, for the last 40-some years, has been receiving an anonymous gift of a framed flower on his birthday. The gift is postmarked from different cities and countries around the world and Vanger believes the gift coincides in some way with his grand-niece, Harriet, who mysteriously disappeared just before the annual birthday presents started arriving.<br /><br />Obsessed with his grand-niece's disappearance, Vanger has spent years trying to solve the mystery. Unsuccessful and faced with his own mortality, Vanger hires disgraced journalist and magazine publisher Mikael Blomkvist to look into the mystery under the ruse of writing a history of the Vanger family. Did I mention there's a very large Vanger family? So large that it required a family tree at the front of the book to keep track of them all? Eventually Blomkvist joins with Lisbeth Salander, an emotionally scarred computer hacker who works for a security firm and is the tattooed titular character, and together - as Blomkvist sleeps his way through all the female characters in the story - the two of them begin to inch slowly toward the truth. Yes, there's a link between Salandar, the security firm and Blomkvist, but it's not relevant to my comments.<br /><br />Basically this is a locked room mystery without any of the mystery or charm of a locked room mystery. There are subplots involving a corrupt businessman and sexual abuse that I thought took away from the basic mystery and I found the English translation awkward at times. For the most part, I found all of the characters - and there are a lot of them in this book - unlikeable. There are a lot of place references in the story and I think a reference map would have been nice.<br /><br />Finally, the thing that I couldn't stop focusing on while reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is that characters in this book drink a lot of coffee. In fact characters don't really do anything in this book without drinking coffee and they drink so much coffee that I frequently felt like I had to go to the restroom while reading.<br /><br />I give my friend a do-over on this one and I would only recommend this book to someone else after telling them I didn't think it lived up to the hype.ught took away from the basic mystery and I found the English translation awkward at times.

014017821X|5.0|Angela Carter's retelling of classic fairy tales adds social and political agendas to stories everyone knows and loves. The stories are used as a medium to encourage adults, most especially women, to explore themselves and the world they live in. While not the only message, a large part of this is to encourage sexual relationships and to reexamine traditional gender values. While this draws a lot of feminist readings, the text certainly has something for every adult who has wanted to see their childhood stories age with them.

B000002G85|5.0|This album is the most unique Clapton work ever. The songs he cowrote with Delaney Bramlett (incorrectly credited to Bonnie on the cd booklet) are fantastic american sounding Rock and soul music. He would later come close to this with some songs on slowhand and 461 Ocean Blvd. But this is his most joyfull rockin record he ever did. My favorite Clapton.
1439107955|5.0|It took me some time to complete my reading of this book but in a way that's a compliment to its author. There is so much detailed research and fascinating background to \\"the story\\" that I found myself frequently pursuing further sources. Dr Mukherjee's career to date reveals him as an humantistic clinical scholar. Both his patients and his readers have cause to be grateful for his efforts.
B00000016K|5.0|This is what Cream was really all about. The live sections are simply astounding to listen to. The Jamming is phenomenal. The studio material is very adventurous, at times quieter and shows the musical identity of each member (kind of like the 'white album'). The DCC version is supposed to be the best sounding remaster. I believe it. The album like all other Cream albums was not known for high fidelity sound. But Steve Hoffman for the live parts really cleaned up and EQ'd mostly the low end (you can hear the Bass playing much better) and created better stereo separation and best sound possible for all the music here.
0439023491|4.0|At first I was slightly disappointed with this book.  It didn't have the fire and action that the first one had.  The momentum to get anywhere was slow.  It felt like the author was just treading water.  I found myself actually skimming over parts of the description of getting them dressed for their tours.  So utterly boring.  The author tries to bring in some angst in a love story conflict between Katniss/Peeta/Gale yet we hardly get to know Gale so it is hard to understand Katniss' potential love for him.  I find his character one dimensional in both the first and second book.<br /><br />Then the author did what she does best and halfway through the book, the characters are thrown back into the dome for another \\"game\\".  This game has even more twists and turns than the first game Katniss and Peeta are thrown into.  The creativity and imagination of this series is amazing.  From here on out the action never stops....and what a cliffhanger ending!  It had me clicking the \\"buy now\\" button on the third book instantly after finishing it.  I'm still giving it a loved it rating because the last half redeems the incredibly slow start of the book.
B0000793Z9|5.0|This has some of the Somple Minds best material. They jumped styles a lot in their first 10 years. The good is that there's nice contrast in the writing, dark and light. The bad, the production could've been better, in '80s fashion everything is tweaked in the stdio, vocals somewhat burried, guitars made to sound not like guitars, but rather synths (early '80s, not friendly to guitarists) That said, this 'of the moment' record is arranged with attention to detail and the canvas is full of color even if at times too much. Still, all in all they did a great job, and this is a classic, the best of the genre. The song \\"New Gold Dream has a similar sound to Flock of Seagulls, but it outshines any of their material.
B000JMKNJ2|4.0|Scott Lynch does a wonderful job of creating a group of interesting and sympathetic characters to follow around his cityscape, which works as a nice alternative to the traditional high fantasy worlds common to the genre. The story can be gritty and brutal at times, which further defines the underdog role of the protagonists, who seem to maintain a roguish sense of common decency no matter the cost. The book has a few decent turns, and the plot doesn't always go as you might expect, even though the supporting characters and subplots can be a bit thin at times. Overall, it's a good read, and I can definitely see a bright future for Lynch. I look forward to the rest of the series.
B003W5C0VM|3.0|Actually, I'm sure this would have been a very good concert to attend.  It just doesnt translate to video very well.  The band seemed a little slow and Mick didnt jump around much.  The sound wasnt up to Blu-Ray standards.  I should have just gotten the DVD, it would have been a little cheaper.  I don't think anyone but the most die hard Stones collectors would benefit from this disc.  I'm going to try A Bigger Bang because I do want to see some good Stones action.  I know they are capable of better.  And someone should have told Mick Taylor \\"You're in the Rolling Stones - act like it\\".  Not much of a live performer that Taylor lad.
B0010SKUYM|2.0|Clearly, there are a great many far more patient readers out there than I. This book, while generally well-written, is as slow-moving and devoid of action as any fantasy book I have ever read; I stopped reading with less than a hundred pages left. In addition, the main character (Kvothe), is granted legendary status early in the book, but the story never unfolds to a deed that would seem worthy of this lofty status. He is a famed wizard of some repute, yet there is not a single magical event in the book that even approaches impressive. Also, and perhaps the final straw, the love story is tiresome and never seems to go anywhere. It would seem to me, as is the case with many books of Fantasy and Science Fiction these days, the book would have better served the reader by being about 200 pages, as opposed to the over 700 pages it actually was. Perhaps then the story might have seemed to be moving along.
1439177783|4.0|This is an excellent account of the descent into the madness of Anorexia.  I would not, however, recommend this book to an anorexic or pre-anorexic person as I think it would be way too triggering and instructional. The entire book is an experience of being inside the mind of an anorexic and the recovery is only in the very end of the book.  An anorexic would not be able to understand the irony and madness described, in fact, to an anorexic mind it would all make perfect sense.  I do recommend this book for parents, friends, and therapists of anorexics as it helps to understand the fullness of the anorexic delusion. I'd give it 5 stars if there was more about the recovery.
0385528752|5.0|It's practical, well written and easy to follow.  The examples are timely, the instruction is specific and you can make the information work for you immediately.

B000003TAB|3.0|I'm gonna keep this short but sufficiently helpful because my review got deleted. If this were to be an album, this one be Nirvana's second to worse. Sonically, \\"Insecticide\\" is captivating, but most of the songs lack significance and detract from the quality of this album because certain lyrics are obscene, incoherent, hateful, too specific or unintelligibly ignorant; there's a song featured that was already on \\"Bleach.\\"
1594488843|5.0|Excellent book, should be required reading for all business people!  What worked in the 1950s is not what moves people forward in this millenium and the sooner executives realize this, the better the business world will be.
B0002S947K|2.0|In the crowded field of recorded music by singer-songwriters, Ray LaMontagne has his modest fan base. Maybe he is capable of writing and recording music which exhibits more originality of style and content, but on the evidence of `Trouble' you have to conclude that he has little hope of ever swimming in the same deep waters as Bob Dylan, Neil Young or Leonard Cohen.<br /><br />Overall, `Trouble' is dull and unremarkable. `All the Wild Horses' is just about OK as a stand-alone song, but hardly qualifies as great. To be interesting to the listener a collection needs to be varied, contain light and shade, to include songs in different keys and tempos. Instead, what LaMontagne offers is an OK voice (definitely his strong point) but repetitive formulaic material. An unvarying monotonous drone in the same key with the same chord progressions to every song is hardly likely to beguile the curious, open-minded but musically sophisticated listener. The cumulative effect of all this earnest mediocrity is tedious and vapid.<br /><br />The problem is that LaMontagne is clearly no musician, composer or songwriter - not yet anyway, though he may develop with experience. His good, listenable voice calls out for better material and a good professional band around him. To stand out from the crowd, he needs to increase his versatility of style and write some decent lyrics with originality, wit, irony, poignancy, humor, or bite.<br /><br />Listen to Bob Dylan or any other true master of the craft, Ray, to see how it's done. If you stick with this formulaic mediocrity you are likely to remain, with thousands of others, in the minor league; maybe you're happy there and if so, good luck.<br /><br />If you count yourself part of LaMontagne's modest-sized fan base, then you're likely not to agree with this view because people generally prefer to read positive copy about what they like. However if you honestly get off on this unoriginal and derivative mush and can stand to listen to `Trouble' more than once, good luck to you too. There's plenty of better music out there and when you grow tired of `Trouble' the exploration of richer, more adventurous and original musical territory awaits you.' more than once, good luck to you too. There's plenty of better music out there and when you grow tired of `Trouble' the exploration of richer, more adventurous and original musical territory awaits you.
B002UM5BXW|2.0|Let me stat by saying that Anthony Bourdain is, oddly, a huge inspiration to me. The life lessons to be learned from his relatable, hilarious, and delightfully verbose 'Kitchen Confidential' are countless and invaluable.     That being said, the e-version is abysmal. Bourdain's signature style -- rife with split sentences and tangents (like so) -- is all but lost due to poorly copied sentences and sentence structure from the original print edition. Dashes are omitted, leaving the reader to have to go back and reinterpret the author's intended meaning. I love my Kindle, and I love this book, but it is terribly formatted.
1592402690|5.0|Wonderful, very easy to read book covering all things social and technical. Gave me a new perspective on many things Beatles. Sad I finished it. Highly recommended to anyone, especially to those who like to dissect music. Much insight on the behavior of the Beatles end as well.
B002YIHO7I|5.0|Let me 1st state I've been a fan since 84 with that said this cd is classic. I care not what mood you are in angry mad pissed sad happy etc. Play this cd or any other sade cd you will become relaxed. Her smooth silky voice and flow sings you into a place where your happiness explodes. Your wife/husband/partner/friend will see a side of you they never seen before. I say this to say its a must buy<br /><br />P.S. I finally get to see Sade live june 24 at the izod arena in jersey
B00178JDCK|2.0|The product is cheap money wise and in construction.  The LED stopped working so I opened the case and found very poor workmanship. Cold solder joints, surface mounted components mounted crooked. I was amazed the thing even worked once.     Took several attempts to reach a human, finally got a return authorization number. I sent the pedal to the address listed, they claim to never have received it. 30 days later,  I'm screwed out of $60. Don't waste time or money on Behringer products. Get a Line 6 Verbzilla.
0670022411|3.0|Let me begin by saying that I LOVED this book for about the first 80%, and that's nothing to sneeze at, especially since it is WAY out of my usual genre. It was well-written, fast-paced, and chockablock full of interesting historical references. There was a great story developing and it was moving along nicely. Unfortunately, the pacing began to fall off later in the book, and the story had no ending. Rather, the book is setting up a second in a series. This irritates me to such a degree that this went from a 5-star book to a 3-star.     The story follows Diana Bishop, professor and witch. She discovers an old manuscript at Oxford, an act that sets off all sorts of adventure. Why are others so interested in the manuscript? Can witches and vampires just get along? Honestly, the author did a great job of making me suspend disbelief, and I got caught up in the story. The plot was revealing itself nicely...until it came to a screeching halt. The last sections of this book were slow and nothing really got resolved, which I found to be very frustrating.     Touted as \\"Twilight for Grownups\\", I thought I'd give the book a try...although Twilight was one of the worst books I ever read. It certainly seemed to follow the requirement that if you write a book about the wizards, witches, or vampires, it must appear in the form of a trilogy at a minimum. This strategy works well when each book in a series has a beginning, middle and end.  In the best series-type books, there is usually resolution of one major story arc per book with a hook for the next in the series. This did not happen here, and it's annoying. A book should not exist simply to set up the next book. I felt like there was a classic bait-and-switch here. It looks like you are getting a book with an ending, but in fact, you are going to have to buy the next one to make any progress on the story at all.     This book had the potential to be so sublime as to be one of the best books of the year; yet it left me with abad taste in my mouth.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I gave this guy 5 stars because it is exactly what I paid for. I was just looking for a budget camera bag I could throw my stuff in to get it from A->B and it does just that. I don't plan on rappelling down a mountain or scuba diving with it(nor do I recommend doing so) but if you're just looking for a budget bag that will make getting your camera from your house to your family reunion easier, you can't beat this fella.
B003568FR6|5.0|I lost 15 pounds in a month with this DVD, and I never even made it to the 3rd level. It is one awesome and effective workout, if you're willing to commit to it.
B000GPIPD8|4.0|Here's a review....it rocks. Get it. While everyone else is getting their recent Brothers album you can pick this up and say \\"man I got their old stuff\\". I won't say this is better but it's damn good. Dirty, bluesy, raw. All the normal descriptions for these two at this point. \\"Your Touch\\" I think was a single, and rightly so. One way cool song I'm sure alot will agree is \\"You're The One\\". A mellow moment on the album and a highlight. What I like most about The Black Keys is that it sounds like they're just rockin' somebody's basement, but I'm there too, drinking a beer and chillin' on a very old couch.
B004BBDHEK|2.0|I am a true Yanni fan for over a decade now.  This new CD is just another dissapointment after the Voices.  The CD semms to be done on a synthetizer with no feeling or drama that was so characteristic of Yanni's music.  The tracks just drone on and the music is tired.  It cannot be comparted to albums like If I Could Tell You, Acropolis, Tribute or Ethnicity.  One must wonder if Yanni has written all his good music and there is nothing left in him or he went commercial. I don't recommend this CD.  If you want good music, buy his old CDs.
B000YXMMAE|4.0|I won't quite call this their best album, but for me it's right there with Bends, OK Computer and Kid A. Even the cover art I love. It gives me a warm feeling. I picked this record up the moment \\"House Of Cards\\" graced my ears. Damn cool video too. I was happy to find the majority of the album is similiar, and typical Radiohead I guess you could say. It's very easy to put this on and just let your mind drift away. Catchy, moody, beautiful. An essential album for the true fan.
B0040JHL3Q|5.0|The shoe is wonderful. This is my third pair. I am training for a 10K and these fit perfectly and make me feel more energetic while running.
B000IFQLLY|3.0|I'll compare this to The Cure's greatest hits: good, but just the basics. I'm not even the biggest DM fan and I could add another 15 songs to this collection easy. So I called this pretty much for the new fan or the completist. More worthy if you get the version with the DVD of course. Still great songs no doubt, but like others have mentioned the non-chronological order is jolting at times. If the songs you're wanting are here, perfect. If not, get one or both of the singles collections. Or wait...I'm sure a 2-disc Very Best is just a matter of time.
0894803123|5.0|Ya its a dilemma... Guess I'll make some ice cream :)  Seriously buy this book, you'll pick out 8 or 20 recipes that will become favourites.  You can't go wrong.  I picked up Ben and Jerry's Homemade Ice Cream with the other book 'Making Artisan Gelato' by some other dude, and if you pick up these two books, your set forever.  Totally worth it.  Just buy it, ask the wife later.
B003Y5H4SO|4.0|This movie is narrated from the stand point of Ramirez (Jacob Vargas), a gentleman with a spanish accent, this lends itself nicely to folklore and the old wives' fable that is about to be told. He is a security guard, that works in the building that is in question. He has been told this story, about to unfold by his mother, however, the settings and events would have been somewhat different. But, the general pattern is the same.<br /><br />As an initiation, there is usually a suicide that takes place at the scene as the devil enters the location. The concept is that the devil, at times will manifest himself as a human to torment certain evil souls before they are killed and taken off to Hell.<br /><br />In this particular scenario, an elevator is the chosen venue to torment the unfortunate souls. Five persons, 2 women and 3 men enter the elevator, one is the devil, but no-one except the devil knows this. The contenders are as follows:<br /><br />[1] An ex-soldier that has a spotty criminal record. He  has a stash of tools hidden in the Men's Room and did not bother to sign in with security at the front desk.<br />[2] An Old Lady that has stolen the receptionist's purse. She arms herself with pepper spray.<br />[3] A Young Lady that is on her way to meet her lawyer to clean out her husband financially, who owns the security firm that has the responsibity for the building's security.<br />[4] A temporary Security Guard that is on his second day on the job. He also has a criminal record, and is known for violence.<br />[5] A Salesman that has gotten a considerable amount of wealth through a Ponzi Scheme. One of his victims has committed suicide.<br /><br />Bodies start to drop in the elevator as the movie progresses. However, each time the lights in the elevator go out just at about that time, so the damage is done under the cover of darkness. It is a \\"Who Done it\\" in close quarters and fingers point wildly, as fears and emotions rise.<br /><br />Although this film is centered around the elevator, there is still enough shots in and around the building to keep the interest and variety going.<br /><br />The film is very suspenseful, and most of the actual violence is hidden with only the aftermath being made visible. This is a descent movie in terms of its production quality, and it will keep the viewer interested right down to the ending, which is as usual quite surprising and with a twist.s in and around the building to keep the interest and variety going.

B000002A3T|5.0|I'll keep this brief and to the point.   At first (way back in '94) I was underwhelmed when I heard it. I get some of the criticisms that it seems less provocative than some earlier work.   But after 18-ish years of listening to it I realize it's glory. from concept to execution it is a masterpiece. As good as their pinnacle effort \\"Momentary Lapse of Reason\\" which suffers from much of the same narrow-minded criticism.   Admittedly I am in the Gilmour camp in general, and tend toward the more considered and crafted pieces but this album just never gets old. In fact, it still sounds pretty fresh today. I still remember watching the High Hopes video on the enormous circular screen on that tour and feeling completely overwhelmed. As an aside, I think the visuals of Storm Thorgerson deserve more credit in the creative alchemy that is Pink Floyd.
B004EQAVHI|1.0|This was a depressing, stupid movie--waste of time--made from a stupid, depressing book. The joke's on me. I read the book and watched the movie. Teens will LOVE it!
B000PMLFRA|1.0|These films warrant a comprehensive collection of ALL versions of the original films...         1. original theatrical release      2. re-release to theater version (added ships, cleaned up poor bluescreen work, etc.) - this is the one I'm most interested in.        3. special edition (wacky-CGI-muppet-dance version)      Stop holding out on your fans!  I won't buy the set until it includes the older versions of the movies.
B0041KKYCY|4.0|Director Meir Zarchi's 'DAY OF THE WOMAN' gets a modern retro upgrade in Director Steven R. Monroe's harrowing remake of 'I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE'.  Since the original was made during the upheaval of the seventies with the Vietnam war and the cinemas changing persona, the grit and grain upgraded Zarchi's low budget entry into cult classic status.  Now in the modern age of the 'SAW' and 'HOSTEL' franchises not to mention the remake of 'LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT', his vision was ripe for a definitive version.  All the harrowing traumas of the original are given detail that could never have been dreamed of in the seventies.  Now we have cam-corders filming Jennifer Hill's rape and also her filming one of her episodes of revenge.  Computers and cellphones are also in the picture but the real improvement is the background development of each of the protaganists making Jennifer's retaliation all the more deserved.  Sarah Butler as Jennifer is not as gritty as Camille Keaton's original performance but it definitely gets the job done.  Warning, to viewers who have not seen the original, this is pretty strong stuff including the violation of Jennifer's character so be warned.  As far as remakes go, this is one of the best and since Meir Zarchi also has an executive producers credit, he should be comfortable in knowing that his vision has finally been fulfilled in all of its blood soaked glory.  Viva La Feminine!!!!
B004FGN3WC|2.0|Unfortunately, when the product first came out Amazon didn't offer to sell the collectible egg, so I was forced to buy directly from Fox.  Even so, I wanted to share my opinions here to help those that are on the fence about buying it.    Don't!    The plastic egg is just awful, but even worse the cardboard case that holds the discs is shoddy and cheap.  Unless you like kitschy, plastic baubles, the egg is DEFINITELY not a collectible item.  It'd be far more worthwhile to buy the $99 version of the film at Amazon, then put the $50 towards a truly excellent polystone or resin piece over at Sideshow.     As a hardcore fan of the Alien films, you absolutely owe it to yourself to buy the Anthology, even if you have the Quadrilogy on DVD.  However, stick with the cheaper set and save yourself the buyer's remorse I have.
157421327X|5.0|The book is great and give you many ideas to use and some of the ideas helped me to get my own zeentangles doodles going :) if you like to doodle this is a great book if you want some art.
B004M8KLYQ|5.0|PJ Harvey expands her style in a way she has never done before.  I listened to the album 8 times on NPR before it was released and had to get it.  Songs are similar enough in style to be on the same album, but each has it's own feeling.  It's not rock, and it's not classical piano like her last, but it is great, with depth of instruments and sounds, you will be able to enjoy this one for a long time.
B003X1OLDA|5.0|I cannot believe no one has yet to review this CD collection!!!  Well then, allow me to be the first.  I have been a Camel fan for some 30 odd years now.  I remember walking into a bar in San Juan, Puerto Rico and Camel was blasting out of the speakers.  However, at that time I did not know who they were but I DID like what I heard.  Sometime later I walked into  my favorite record (that's right!  RECORD!!!) store, the proprietor was playing the very same song I heard at that bar.  I quickly asked him who that was playing.  He sad \\"Camel.\\"  I asked him if he had anything on Camel.  He showed me what he had and I bought every album.  He then told me that a new album was to be released the following week.  So guess what?  I was there next week and bought it.  It was Camel's LIVE ALBUM.  WOW!<br />30-somethings years pass.  I've tried to follow their career with very little success.  After 'Pressure Points', I heard nothing from Camel. CDs came around and I wanted to get every single Camel title on CD.  Finally I accomplished my goal.  Now this CD collection comes along.  Oh sure there are quite a few songs that appear on the other CDs but there are also some songs that were recorded for the BBC that appear for the first time.  All in all, a great gift for yourself or for that special someone who had never before ever heard of them.<br />Personally, I love this set.
0439023521|5.0|I have not read a novel so engrossing in such a long time. The story is so gripping that I took the book everywhere and even if I only had 5 minutes I opened it and read a few paragraphs. It's shocking, mind-boggling, heart-stopping, and almost unbelievable. I say almost because with the way society is headed in our entertainment options, this may actually occur...<br /><br />I love characters that are tangible. Even though they live in a future that hopefully will never happen, one can relate to them in that they have the same hopes and fears as we do today. Katniss hopes her family will survive, and takes Prim's place as a tribute out of fear for her safety. Peeta's heart goes out to the poor starving girl and gives her bread even through his strict mother's wrath. They have their good points, and their flaws as well, which always make for good characters.<br /><br />It's just so shocking. To think that the people in power were so blase about setting teenagers against each other to the death. I realize it was to hold fear over their heads because of a rebellion, but these are human beings! The indifference that a lot of them showed made me sad for the society in general.<br /><br />It is a dark novel that takes using fear as power to a whole new level. I sometimes wonder if the author got the idea for the book from the reality show \\"Survivor\\"...But as scary as it was, it's such an interesting story that if you have not read it yet, do so. I can't wait to read the next two.
B000JLTRIG|4.0|Wow I Allways Have Loved Every Season Of Charmed But This Season Was Actually Boring For Me. About Half Of The Ep's Were Great Half Were Just Plain Boring I Love All The Actors But It Just Seemed A Little Washed Out. Still Buy It I Just Think Seasons   1-6 Are The Best :)
B001E45XT4|3.0|3 stars cause its listed as a xbox 360 headset but its not.easy fix doe..just buy a the xjacker and you should be good..the headset has great sound quality for its price
B003VANOFY|1.0|Do not purchase these headphones, they sound terrible and conflict with anything wireless, hell even my logitech harmony remote would cause these to static up. Noise canceling does not work and even though logitech has been aware since last year, they haven't don't anything about it.      Please save your money and avoid this product
B002ZG977Y|2.0|(Warning Possible Spoiler)<br /><br />\\"Clash of the Titans\\" not realistic when it comes to historical accuracy, but then again most movies based on greek, roman or any other mytholgies never are. This is a remake of the campy but cool 1981 version, and this one features way better special effects and acting and storytelling as bland and predictable as it comes. Sam Worthington (Terminator 4) stars as Perseus son of Zeus who is raised by a fishing family that is killed when Zeus statue is destroyed by an army defying the gods. Perseus is discovered by soldiers of Argos and after discovering he is Zeus' son is asked to take the task of defeating Hades and killing a creature known as \\"The Kraken\\". What follows is a series of battle scenes with various monsters that while impressive really don't have any reason to them, they just happen.<br /><br />Zeus (Liam Neeson, \\"Taken\\") wants his son to take his place as one of them, while Hades (Ralph Finnes \\"Red Dragon\\") wishes for the destruction of all man and wants to become the leader of the gods after being cast out by Zeus some time ago. There's also some race called the Djinn, which are neat looking conjourers that live in the desert that really are about the only cool characters in the whole movie.<br /><br />You get it all in this movie, giant scorpions, bad acting, a battle with Medusa, bad dialogue, the Kraken, and stale characters. Its a quick film, maybe 95 mins before the end credits start, but unfortunately all the thought and effort seemed to be put into the special effects. Again the acting, writing, stale characters really bring it down.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|My son loves this movie.  He highly recommends it.  And I enjoyed the movie as well.  If you are interested to know how Facebook was created, this gives you a quick recap of what happened.
B004DK49DW|3.0|While the music is still good, it lacks the desperation, despair and anger of their previous music.  Perhaps they have less to be angry about as they have gotten older.
0316286850|5.0|Very good book! I finished makeup course in a prestigous school and still found it very informative and helpfull! Definitely something each makeup artist should have. Great for those of you who arent professional. Really good book!
B003EYVXXW|4.0|Very well done movie, didnt want it to end...the script was so good I think almost anyone could have directed it...the sets and costumes were very good, even the CGI was done well (which is rare). This movie isnt for everyone, mostly people interested in the period, whether it be for philosophy, religion, or just historical value. The only reason I dont 5-star it is because the writing was, well, glib, at times; using words and phrases that dont belong in a movie such as this. The writer (who also directed it) should have taken pride in his historical epic and picked just one character to espouse utterances of poetry, this would be appropriate for either Hypatia's or her fathers character, even \\"Gladiator\\" featured some very clever, poetic lines, it is writing that keeps many of watchers (especially in films like this) coming back to rewatch the film.
B001E45XT4|2.0|This one is definitely not one of Plantronics best. I'm not gonna make an essay about this, but I will blatantly point out the pros and cons about this headset. Beware that although I've only been using them for about 2-3 hours now, I've had plenty of headsets before and hardly write reviews because either they're satisfactory, or they aren't bad enough to write about without sounding like some obnoxious demanding customer who expects nothing but perfection out of everything.    It's as simple as this:    Pros  *Microphone works really well despite not being very close to the mouth.  *The headset encompasses around your ear.  *Loud.    Cons  *Audio quality not good at all. There's no bass whatsoever.  *Thick and clunky design. Even the dial for the volume is unnecessarily big; it's about as big as the volume dial for my regular 4.1 speakers.  *Only comfortable if you're wearing Iron Man's mask; or something equally as durable. The noticeable unfavorable amount of pressure these things try to force into your head are cushioned by soft pads, so it's doesn't make it painful.  *Loud. Too loud. Yes, I know I said that as a pro, but it's also a con. People in the room next door, or 3 doors down will hear these in the dead of night. It's not good for night-gaming unless you're single and forever alone.      I rather recommend another pair of Plantronics headsets to anyone who reads this:    Plantronics 3D Surround Sound Gaming Headset (USB Full Range Stereo) (Audio 770)  [..]    Unfortunately Amazon has been out of stock on these for quite some time now, and they're quite hard to find at a cheap price. But if you ever come across them, they are -wonderful- and you should buy them on the spot when discounted. However, the only bad thing about them is the microphone...it tends to fall out of place and goes down below your chin. Other than that, some glue will fix it back into place and they are perfect.    So yeah, this GameCom 367 headset is trash. I would recommend it to my enemies.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|I purchased this for the DVD and was not disapointed. If you've been to, or wished you had attended a McCartney concert this is like reliving the moment.
031603438X|2.0|Keith Richards as a musician and Keith Richards as a writer are at opposite ends of the talent spectrum. As the musician, he's Royalty. As a writer, he's anything but. His \\"Life\\" is a mess, literally and literature-ly. From drugs and arrests to riffs, silly sods and girlfriends, Keith drones on and on and on--incoherently much of the time--for nearly 550 pages (of which, I may have spot read less than half). I'm sorry, I wanted to like it, I really did. I love the Stones and all, but this book is a real beast of burden. And that's if you can understand him. Save your money for tickets to his next concert tour.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|Loved the books, so, naturally, had to see the movies. The movies have grown on me.  The books are still better, though.  :-)
B00381A1MU|4.0|We love Thomas and friends so naturally this would also be a child we enjoy.  The magnet isn't very easy to manipulate; however, the rubbish and recycling cars make an appearance in at least one episode so they are naturally an excellent addition to our collection.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Nicki Minaj is not you typical-Missy Elliot Lil Kim female rapper, her music has the ability to blend pop & rap together and target both of the genres listeners. It's like Taylor Swift, you can hate country but still listen to her. Her songs are catchy, mainstream and still rap. Some will not likely tune this cd but i believe it should be inspiring to new female rappers.
B00005JN8Z|4.0|Mervyn LeRoy's sword and sandal spectacular features an icy non-chemistry between the fey protagonist (Robert Taylor, who was gay) and his lovely co-star (Deborah Kerr, who was known to be insatiable); a cornball but no less moving score by that greatest of sword and sandal composers (Miklos Rozsa); magnificent recreations of Rome on what appear to be Cine Citta sets, and a supporting performance for the ages: Peter Ustinov's Nero must be seen to be believed.  Stealing every scene he is in, Ustinov shines as the mad emperor, plucking Hugh Gray-composed lyrics for his boring lyre pieces, blaming the burning of Rome on the Christians, which we now know to be doubtful at best. But, hey, this is the Hollywood treatment, with a tradition of foisting massive (and massively boring) movies about the early Christians, a subject done well only two times better than this, by Pasolini (\\"Gospel According to Saint Matthew\\") and Nick Ray (\\"King of Kings\\").  If the category is broadened to include all Hollywood sword and sandal pics, I would add \\"The Fall of the Roman Empire\\" by Anthony Mann.  What is important here is that LeRoy does not realize how ridiculous his orgies are, which makes them High Camp.  Ustinov appears the only one in the cast who is onto the joke: he eats up the scenery like a starving thespian, even going so far as to suggest ol' Nero might have been a little light in the loafers.
B003Y7L5W8|4.0|Reviews of this album are really polarized between those who were fans of OMD's earlier experimental sound and those who liked their well-known 80's new wave hit output. (I am ignoring their last couple of albums that barely registered in the consciousness.) This album in particular reminds me of \\"Pacific Age\\" era OMD, combining some of that funkiness and wailing female vocals that they were adding to their songs. Like many OMD albums, there are some \\"eh?\\" filler tracks, but the 4 or 5 should-be-classic new wave tracks included are more than enough to make this a must have for any OMD fan. For those complaining about specific tracks, OMD has always been known for putting in some \\"wierd\\" sounding tracks among the hits, even on their most well-known albums, so I don't see this as any different.

0891419063|5.0|Sledge does a masterful job of explicitly bringing to the reader both the horror and heroism he witnessed during the Pacific campaign of World War 2. There is little flag waving or jingoism in his story. It is all about young men trying to stay alive while having to live and fight in unbelievably brutal and hostile conditions. Sledge, as a lowly private in the Marine Corp, gives the reader a front row seat to the extended hell these young enlisted men endured. As an accurate chronicle of the War in the Pacific it would be hard to beat this book. That is probably why both Ken Burns and Tom Hanks used it extensively in their works documenting the war in the Pacific.

B0025KVLT2|5.0|I purchased all the remastered cds and they are amazingly better then the originals.  As for the Beatles I do not have the command of the English language to choose words that can do them justice.It is amazing to think how young they were and the insight they had. Growing up in the 60ies these guys and Vietnam changed our society from trusting authority( government) to questioning authority.  Perhaps my all time favorite song is on this album  \\"in my life\\" it  bring tears to my eyes it is so beautiful.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I had never heard of Winter's Bone when the Academy Award nominations were announced.  Having seen all the other nominated movies, I decided to watch it as well.    In my humble opinion, this film blows the rest of the nominees away.  It is so raw and real that you feel the blows (both physical and emotional) that are taken by Ree as if you were on the receiving end.  The harsh, poverty stricken and historically insular Ozark community is unflinchingly depicted.  The families who in the past were moonshiners have become \\"cookers\\" of crank and meth.  Their clannish tendencies have progressed to an almost mafia mentality of secrets and coverups.  Young Ree Dolly is only 17 but has been left to care for 2 young siblings and a mentally ill mother.  Her father, a well known \\"cooker\\", has disappeared after putting up the family home and land as collateral for his bond.  Ree sets out to find him despite being met with hostility and violence from everyone including her own uncle.  The truth that she finally uncovers leads to one of the most emotionally affecting scenes that I have ever watched in a movie.  It's a film that stays with you.  If I could vote for Best Picture, this would definitely be my pick.
030745455X|3.0|In this sequel to The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Mr Larsson again crafts a great tale of intrigue about what starts out as the sex trade and morphs into something even more sinister. Lisbeth Salander and Mikael Blomkvist return to bust the sex trade in Sweden open but soon realize they may be in over their heads.<br /><br />My opinion - Although this book keeps your attention for the most part throughout with many twists an turns, I start to feel towards the end of the book that Mr. Larsson at first tried to give a little too much depth to too many characters. It feels like later in the book realizes his mistake and tries to end the book abruptly but ends up settling for a \\"to be continued\\"-type ending. Don't get me wrong the book is still a page turner but, it could have still kept your interest and told the same story with about 100-200 less pages.
B003UBTX7C|3.0|Sorry, but I thought the book was OK but not great.  The Camel Club concept is just an excuse for lazy writing as he just pops stuff into the formula and comes out with a book guaranteed to sell well because of his reputation.  It is entertaining but not much more than that.  ANd the characters are not complex at all.  If you've read the earlier books they are kind of card board to me.    If you want to see what promise Baldacci had earlier in his career read The Winner.  Although the end of that book kind of sagged, the beginning and middle of that book are about as good as it gets.    I have been waiting for him to live up to that level of writing since and been disappointed.    Unfortunately the author is taking fewer risks these days in his writing and I wish he'd take a few more.  Maybe write under a pseudonym if necessary.    I just want him to surprise me like he use to.
B0042RUMEQ|5.0|Warning! I bought this album because the cover intrigued me haha. I also read one of the 1 star reviews and it stated that this album was too commercial. YES! SOLD!    Guilty! I am so not a big fan of rap, which is exactly why I love this album. It is so much fun. Yes, she raps...but the beats are danceable and most songs contain a sung chorus. And anyone who samples 'Video Killed the Radio Star' and 'No More I Love Yous' in a rap song is a winner by me.    Lots of guest artists too.    If you LOVE straight up serious rap artists, then perhaps this album is not for you. If you like your rap with a Beyonce/Black Eyed Peas twist...BUY IT! If you love music for the tune - BUY IT! It will put a smile on your dial and a tap in your soles : )
B003DZX44I|5.0|Beauty and the Beast, is a great movie for ALL ages, and family for entertainment. I ordered this dvd as a gift for my girlfriend, which she loves anything Disney, is especially GREAT because it's in Blu-Ray format and has a bonus dvd. Can't bet the quality of this dvd. Will be enjoyed for years to come....
0307454541|4.0|This is the world renowned, best-selling novel by Stieg Larsson about a bisexual, tough-as-nails, loner, private investigator and the investigative journalist who join forces to solve a decades old murder of Swedish teenager from a wealthy yet dysfunctional family.<br /><br />My opinion - Great stuff, in this book Mr. Larsson keeps your attention the entire time from the initial premise of a long lost, murdered niece to the shocking conclusion. An excellent page-turner of novel.
B0012GMW34|5.0|i got the vinyl way back in '73...and loved it so much i just had to get a CD version (and some bonus cuts too!)....this is Santana at his peak and McLaughlin announcing his gigantic presence,as shown in the 1st 2LP's of Mahavishnu Orchestra.If youre a fan of both these guys,this record IS A MUST!
B00133KFGW|5.0|I have read some 1 star reviews saying this is in no way a 5 star movie. These reviewers, if you read them are obviously music teachers or musicians that are the epitome of the bully in the orphanage. They have issues and can't accept that it's a movie and is fantasy. It is not based off real people. These people would try to force anyone with talent better than themselves to deny that talent out of jealousy. Fine, it is very exagerated that our boy can pick up sheet music and just know how to read it and compose a song in less than 1 day but like I said. It's a movie.<br />On to the review:<br />I love this movie. I am not going to start flashing names of artists they were copying for Freddie Highmore's style of playing but there are originators of it out there for longer than you think.<br />As we begin, we have Evan - Aka August Rush (Freddie Highmore) in an orphanage and he is bullied for being different. Flash to 11 yrs earlier to Keri Russell (Celebrated Julliard celloist) and Jonathan Rhys Meyers (budding Rock star) meeting and having a one night stand. Keri is controlled by her father William Sadler so the relationship doesn't take off.<br />Back to Evan in the present - He leaves to find his parents by \\"following\\" the music.<br />Terence Howard is the child services rep trying to find him.<br />Robin Williams is the person who takes him in which is the \\"Oliver Twist\\" part. He gives Evan the name August Rush as a stage name but also to hide him from the authorities in order to use his talents. Not his best work but the character was not supposed to be outright violent or dangerous. He is a guy that you just don't know how off his rocker he is or how violent he COULD be.<br />The rest of the movie is a show of the close calls of the father, mother and Evan coming so close to meeting it will make you almost cry. You spend the movie beginning to believe that as long as Evan is playing, his mother and father will find him.<br />If you have no hope, don't watch it. Or, better yet, you should be watching it.ld be watching it.
1440503257|1.0|Heard about this from a well-known fansite and immediately put it down on my wishlist. Well, whilst the idea is good, the execution is very disappointing. As a Brit, I have already eaten a good number of the recipes mentioned and have made quite a few of them. However, the recipes in this book seem terribly over-complicated for even me to follow. And as far as things like trifle are concerned, the main wow factor is the presentation, which must be very hard for those who have never seen these foods before. Photos would have made it better.<br />Not to sound harsh, but I don't think the author herself has actually been to the UK and sampled these foods from restaurants or peoples kitchens. To really demystify them for non-Brits, you can't just experiment and hope for the best; you need to compare them to the real thing and then try to adjust them to suit whatever products are sold in America.<br />As for the example pages shown, I have never heard of two rashers of bacon being called a \\"gammon\\". They're just rashers. It might be a regional thing, but I've asked others and they don't call them that either. Gammon is meat from the hind legs of a pig. I might be nitpicking, but if you're going to add in interesting asides, they have to be accurate.
B003Q6D1YW|5.0|This is one of those films that seem to exist in the realm of urban legend or something. Because I can't seem to remember where or when I first heard about it? All I can remember is the hype and hoopla that surrounded this film.    It was almost akin to [[ASIN:B00001QGUM The Blair Witch Project]]. I think it had to do with the ambiguity of the film's title: 'Catfish'. I mean, what could that mean? What could that POSSIBLY mean?    And then there were the trailers that were popping up. And all the smoke and mirrors that seemed to surround the three filmmakers as they took their little summer 'road trip' to the middle of nowhere.    And then there was the scene (hope I'm not spoiling it for everyone), but there's this scene where it's something like like 2:30 in the morning where the guys are pulling up to this barn/farm thing. I mean, it's scary enough because it's so darn dark and if that isn't bad enough, the one guy--Nev actually gets out of the car and goes up to the thing. That's where the trailer kinda cuts out.    Now, I'm not going to give anything away from this film, though I was planning to. Because there was just TOO much hype about this film. And I think it was because of this hype, that people were going to this film.    Now, I'm not above the hype. But, I think a film should deserve it first. In other words, the hype should merit the film.    Only the thing is, the film didn't really need it. It didn't need ANY of it.    Because if this movie had just unfolded as a portrait piece of what happens when three filmmakers set out on a particular road trip, that would have been enough. And trust me, it would have.    I mean, for a LOT of people, the media hype kinda got in the way to what the movie was about. What it was really about. And even though I won't give away what in fact it WAS about, I'll say this much: this movie is really good.    Through all of its ups and downs and through all of what the filmmakers had to go through, they put together a really awesome experience.    I mean, it's truly theirs--the experience. But the way they filmed the whole thing, it's like it could've been yours too. They were so giving that way.    And through everything that they had to go through to get this film done, my only hope is that Nev and Ariel and Henry can continue on and be the happy people that they were before this film. I hope they don't become bitter or cynical or whatever else they might feel that can sully up their spirits.    I mean, paraphrasing a line from the film, it's the catfish that keep you from being dull and boring. And maybe hearing something like that, made the whole thing worth it.    This film is AMAZING and I hope a lot of people go out and see it!
0307272702|4.0|To his credit Taubes does lay out in his introduction the book in a \\"nutshell\\".  What follows are exhaustive arguments, science data, empirical and antidotal evidence.  He is very redundant, repetitive and long winded - and perhaps this is what is needed in making a scientific \\"case\\" or argument.  If I hadn't gotten this book as an MP3 - I am not sure I would have finished it.  Purchase this book with a copy of the Atkins or South Beach Diet - because that is the lifestyle/diet that is basically advocated.  I am glad I \\"read\\" this book - the argument was strong enough to convince me to return to the Atkins Diet.  I do recommend buying the book  - it is not enough to know to do something (eat low carb) - you need to know the why.  This book provides the \\"why\\".
B003EY7IRC|5.0|I laughed out loud....   I wiped tears from my eyes...  I was enthralled....  I was left breathless.....    I find it hard to describe this book without giving to much away but it is now one of my favorite books ....ever.    Bravo KMM!
B0034G4OZE|3.0|I purchased this movie because the reviews looked good. As I was watching this movie with my older children, I kept waiting for something exciting to happen. The movie does have a good lesson about life but it dragged on for me. My kids, however, felt it was a good movie. Maybe they can relate more to the pressures of growing up.
0785125965|5.0|This (along with Planet Hulk) is by far my favorite Hulk comic. Great story and artwork. I highly recommend to any Hulk/Marvel fan.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I love this book because it brings a lot of imagination into kids' minds, imagining what they could and would do if they were (like) Percy Jackson. It is also a book that you can reread and still love.
0385339100|1.0|This is the first Grisham novel I've read that I've been thoroughly disappointed with. So many aspects of the book were utterly predictable -- whether he was a murderer, the body actually being a corpse, and so much more. I didn't expect the book to have a happy ending; I thought he'd end up in jail, or something. And yet everything went exactly his way...right up to the last page. I've never been made more miserable by an ending. The story was mediocre at best, and the ending destroyed it.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I re-subscribed to HBO soley to watch this series, in the end i didn't even watch the last episode.  Like many others here i was expecting Band of Brothers quality in the Pacific Theater of WWII.  Well, suffice to say, that it definitely is not.      The story is horribly disjointed and jumps around too much to even bother caring about the cahracters, which is why i didn't give a rats *** about the last episode.  The success of Band of Brothers derived from the fact that they followed the 101st from the beginning to the end.  They didn't curve a new story line off to follow the injured troops in their jury back to America, or follow the story of Sobel.  If you were injured and left the story then you left the movie.  That was the way in real life too.  The guys didn't sit around wondering how ole Garnier was doing in the hospital, there was no time for that.    The Pacific jumps all over the place.  One scene you're in current America, the next you're in Australia, the next your on an Island fighting the Japs, and the next your in someones flashback to America again.  The whole thing will leave you, the viewer, less and less interested as each episode goes on.    And i'll agree, the constant focus on Americans plucking gold teeth out of the dead Japs gets to become redundant.  I could keep going, but it's already all been said by other great one star reviews.  Bottom line is, don't take a chance and buy this.  I almost bought it because of the cheap price just to have in my collection, but after reading some reviews and being reminded just how horrible this series was i will definitely pass.  If you haven't seen it, rent it disc by disc.  That way you won't feel obligated to finish the series after it becomes so disconbobulated that it becomes not worth watching.
B002RKSZKI|2.0|As much as I love Jane Austen, Emma is a horrible read.  This was the only one of Austen's books I couldn't finish in college.  I thought I'd try it again a decade later and I still don't like it (although this time I did finish reading it).    Like some of the other reviewers have stated, Emma is just not a likeable character.  And unlike most of Austen's heroines, she seems to have no redeeming qualities, making it incredibly hard to read about her for hundreds of pages.    I guess one could argue that the book is well written by virtue of the fact that I despise Emma so much as a character.  But I'm not arguing Austen's merits as a writer.  I am simply stating that this book is not worth reading when there are so many other classics out there that you might actually enjoy!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|I am in love with absolutely each and every one of these songs. This craze over this band is, in my opinion, well-deserved.    I hope, more so than with any other artist, that they can continue to make pure gold like this album.
B0027BOL4G|3.0|I wish I could find a DVD on GM foods that didnt have an agenda.... this one obviously does   Monsanto is driven by profit and has many things to answer for, but they were presented here as a Disney villan. I would like a video I can use in an Environmental Science classroom that sticks to the facts and the science, presents all aspects of the situation and gets off the soapbox... this is not that video. It is also of low interest to high school students - I show it since I have nothing better ( any suggestions?), but it is certainly lacking.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Let's get one thing clear immediately; Let Me In is a superb film that is beautifully shot and the actors, specifically the two very young leads, are perfection. Kodi Smit-McPhee, who plays Owen, the physically weak young boy who is under constant attack from three older boys, is so real and so believable that you can't help but feel for him and you, as the viewer, either fall into one of two categories; you are either reminded of him because you were like him... or because you once, long ago, tormented some kid in the way that he is tormented.    Chloe Grace Moretz, the beautiful and amazingly talented young girl who is both Abby and Vampire, is so captivating and stunning in this role that it will certainly be a daunting task for her to ever out-do herself here. However... I have a feeling that we have only been witness to the beginning of her skills as an actress.    By now you should know the history of this movie and what it is based on... w/ out regurgitating all of that yet again, let me just say that this movie will pull you into its story and you won't even realize it while it's happening. The pacing in this film is perfect. Subtle things happen that are so wonderful that you really need to view this movie multiple times to take them all in.    Without giving away any spoilers for those who have not seen this yet I will just say that one of my favorite parts is when Abby is talking to Owen about the bullies at school. She tells him he has to hit back. Hard. Owen keeps making excuses and asking 'What if it doesn't work?' Abby then tells him, 'I'll help you.' He says, \\"But you're a girl.'    She then gently reaches out her hand and touches him and says, 'I'm a lot stronger than you think.' The look on her face in that moment is priceless and difficult to properly convey in words, but it is film making at its finest.    Over time Owen begins to unravel the mysteries of young Abby and though he is scared... even calling his soon-to-be-divorced father and askinghim if evil is real... he also realizes that he loves Abby. After yet another attack by his tormentors at the school swimming pool, Owen is saved by Abby and Owen realizes he has only one choice... to spend his life with her.    It's difficult for me to characterize this as a *Horror* movie, because it is also a love story and a coming-of-age movie. Don't let that deter you though... this is one of those rare times when a movie crosses genres and succeeds on all levels. I rented this and watched it 3 times, returned it and bought the DVD. If you knew how special a movie has to be for me buy it, you would truly understand just how wonderful this film is.
B0041CGP02|5.0|Bon Jovi is one of the greatest Band ever!, in this record you can find out some of the best examples of their music.  I still think they left behind some songs that are a \\"must\\" in a greatest hit collection.  i missed \\"Dry County\\" (one of the best rock songs ever!), missed \\"99 in the Shade\\", but also we have to admit that is very unique that with a 2 cds collection, they had to leave some hits out.  Too many hits on this 26 years of history!!!.    Also included 4 new songs, 2 of them are now part of my favorites; nice lyric and awesome Richie's solos.
030726999X|5.0|Larsson was a genius! Few authors I've read grabbed me like he has. I bought the trilogy a couple of weeks ago and I finished the last book yesterday. I usually take a break between reading books. This time I couldn't. Larsson created a very different kind of hero in Lisbeth Salander. And from what I've read of Larsson, it seems Mikael Blomkvist was modeled after the real Steig Larsson. Outside of Micke being almost totally irresistible to woman, his character seemed very real.<br /><br />But Salander was the real story. Her character was developed so well you can't help but feel like you really know her. She's dark but a very good person. She's troubled but determined. She's highly intelligent but unimpressed by it. She's been treated horribly but never complains. And she's fiercely independent and amazingly resourceful. Despite her 5' tall and 90 pounds frame, she knows how to take care of herself.
0446672653|5.0|This book touched me in so many levels, that I'm ready to go under.... It was so beautifully written and of course the content was so intriguing. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for love, who found love, who had lost love. It touches so many facets of love that it is a must read!!
B0041KKYEW|3.0|To be honest, when I first saw this movie poster for Black Swan (2010), I never thought I would go see this film in the theater. It was just so far outside of my normal movie \\"box\\" that it didn't appeal to me. I figured I would wait for Blu-ray to rent it. And then the critical buzz for it began. I had only seen one Darren Aronofsky film, The Wrestler (2008), up until recently when a friend of mine turned me on to The Fountain (2006). Both movies were good, so I decided to go check out Black Swan and see if this interesting director could make an interesting movie about ballet.<br /><br />Aronofsky did make an interesting and well-crafted movie here. But I've got mixed feelings about the final results. I'm not going to summarize the plot to the film since I don't feel there's much of one here, so what little there is should be left for you to discover while watching the film. I think the strongest part of the film is the middle act where we see Natalie Portman's lead character Nina Sayers become more like the black swan instead of the white swan that she has been all of her life. It's the mixing of the two aspects of her psychology, black & white, yin & yang, that interested me the most. The first act where we are introduced to Nina and the rest of the characters in the story dragged a bit for me. And I found Nina's innocent and naive \\"white swan\\" life to honestly be annoying. I just didn't buy into this young woman in New York City being so immature and princess-like in our modern 21st century. Especially as an urban girl. I couldn't wait for her to get \\"real\\" and more like the black swan. I see what Aronofsky was doing here in heavily emphasizing the contrast between the white swan and black swan personalities of Portman's character as we move through the movie, but it just felt too forced, theatrical, and over-the-top for me to relate to it and enjoy it. Being a 37-year old man whose never been in to theater or ballet, the story itself was not very appealing from the beginning. And rather than make that world more accessible to me, I think Aronofsky closed me off to it by stereotyping it and making it feel fake and theatrical. It may be that the real world of ballet is like Aronofsky's portrayal, but that doesn't mean it makes a good film...at least not for me.<br /><br />The bottom line is that the story just didn't work for me overall. That being said, I did really enjoy the scenes between Natalie Portman and Mila Kunis, who plays Nina's competition within the ballet group. Kunis is more purely black swan compared to Portman's white swan. And the pairing of these two personalities gave real sizzle to those scenes where they psychologically, verbally, and physically battle each other. They had onscreen chemistry that was exciting. Kunis really showed her acting talents in her role as Lily in Black Swan. I can't wait to see her get more dramatic roles where she can put those talents to use further. Vincent Cassel, as ballet director Thomas Leroy was great as well. His dialogue just chewed into Portman, creating very highly charged scenes between the two. Barbara Hershey as Nina's mom was a little too crazy for me to appreciate. Her botched-looking facial plastic surgery was distracting and creepy. I'm assuming that Hershey made the mistake of trying to look younger than her age at some point in her life and got plastic surgery that just hasn't held up well over the years. Either that or she just hasn't aged well. Either way, I didn't care for Hershey in this film. Finally, Winona Ryder has a small part in the film that brings her back to the screen in a good role after many years of wasting away in bad to average movies.<br /><br />Now aside from the story within Black Swan, there is some real filmmaking craft in the movie. I think the cinematography by Matthew Libatique is well shot and good looking. There was a little too much handheld photography for my taste. When I actively notice that the camera is handheld in a film,I tend to dislike it because then it feels more forced to me. And there were times in Black Swan when I had no idea why handheld was the choice. It just made me feel dizzy and sick from all the heavy jittery camera moves. I like handheld photography, but it can be over done too. Still, there is some incredible photography in Black Swan that makes it worth seeing simply for that.<br /><br />Clint Mansell's music for the Black Swan is good. Not quite as good as I think he did with The Fountain (2006) and Moon (2009), but his reinterpretation of Tchaikovsky's music from Swan Lake is interesting and something that I want to listen to on its own to really appreciate. Mansell does a good job of helping emotionally tell Aronofsky's story in this film, and that is where a good film score starts in my opinion. Production design, costumes, make-up and everything in the art department for Black Swan are top notch. It's all of these supporting aspects of filmmaking that really helped keep Black Swan enjoyable for me to watch when I was bored or disinterested with the story. I could focus on the music, photography, and everything else and notice how well done each was.<br /><br />I give Black Swan 3 stars out of 5. What keeps it from a rating of 2.5 stars is the cinematography, music, production design, and acting. The story of Black Swan is a mix of drama, thriller, and horror genres with a bit of musical thrown in. I doubt that Black Swan will be a film that I watch repeatedly over the years because it was just too over-the-top for me. I can see why there are many critics and fans of this film that are enamored with it. But it just wasn't a film for me. I can appreciate it like a fine wine, but like wine, it either tastes good to you or it doesn't. And Black Swan left a bit of a bitter taste in my mouth. I suggest you wait and rent this film on Blu-ray to see if you have a taste for it.cause then it feels more forced to me.

B000002UA5|4.0|Pink Floyd was still finding its way upon release of this early effort. Syd Barrett was gone by this point, and his replacement, singer/guitarist David Gilmour, was a stronger musician and vocalist but a lesser songwriter. Fortunately, the format for this album de-emphasized songwriting in favor of live performance of mostly previous material on disc 1 and studio experimentation on disc 2. The live half of the album is dynamite -- GREAT, cosmic, driving, forceful takes of Barrett's \\"Astronomy Domine\\" and the eerie \\"Careful With That Axe, Eugene.\\" Disc 2 ... well, it doesn't quite hang together, but then, it wasn't really meant to do so anyway. Each band member gets half a (vinyl) side to do his stuff. Rick Wright's \\"Sisyphus\\" is probably the most musically thought out, but there's more structure here than inspiration. Gilmour later scoffed at his effort, \\"The Narrow Way,\\" though the piece is well-executed, if thin on ideas. Nick Mason's drum workout \\"The Grand Vizier's Garden Party,\\" has some nice moments, mixing percussion with sound effects and suggesting what would come later when the idea was fully realized on \\"Dark Side of the Moon.\\" Finally, bassist Roger Waters turns in a wonderful, nostalgic song, \\"Grantchester Meadows,\\" marred only by his rather weak vocal. And that leaves us with the notorious \\"Several Species of Small Furry Animals Gathered Together in a Cave and Grooving With a Pict,\\" an uproarious FX-laden riff featuring animal noises and a nearly Neolithic rant. Hmm ... I used to love playing this one for people who were in an, um, ALTERED state and watching them freak. But in the end, it's a novelty song. Still, overall, \\"Ummagumma\\" was a powerful suggestion of the colossus the Floyd would become just a few years later. Definitely still worth a listen, but not essential, either.
B002RKRTGO|1.0|This is one of my all time favorite books but;<br /><br />This Kindle version is missing very important parts to the story.  Every time a letter or newspaper is read it is left blank.  The whole story is based on the information in the letter and newspaper clippings.  They are missing in this edition, even as a previous fan of the story I am having some difficulty in following along.  If you are not familiar with the story you will be completely lost.
B002ZG997M|4.0|One of the most stunning stylistic movies I've seen in years is The Book of Eli (2010), Denzel Washington's recent post-apocalyptic genre addition. Directors (and brothers) Albert and Allen Hughes have created one of the better films in this popular Hollywood genre, and clearly left their mark as talented filmmakers all over it. The loosely defined apocalypse genre is hard to categorize. It's usually a bit sci-fi, drama, thriller, and action. You've got films like The Terminator (1984), Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), and Twelve Monkeys (1995) that are mostly set in the time BEFORE the apocalyptic event they are about takes place. These films are about the attempt to prevent the apocalypse from happening. Then you've got the films that are basically set DURING the apocalyptic event, like Deep Impact (1998), Armageddon (1998), and The Seventh Sign (1988), where everyone's efforts to prevent the disaster ultimately fail. And finally you have films set AFTER the apocalyptic event where it's all about the survival in this new reality, like Waterworld (1995), The Postman (1997), The Matrix (1999), Planet of the Apes (1968), and The Road (2009). The Book of Eli fits into the latter category of movies after the apocalypse, where people are forced to deal with a new, usually dark and twisted, world.<br /><br />Set in what is assumed to be the desert Southwest of the United States, The Book of Eli is a pretty simple story about a man named Eli whose sole purpose in life is to guard one of the last books left in the world and take it on its journey to its final destination, revealed through the course of the movie. After the apocalypse, there was a manic fever of book burning and destruction that basically rid the world of books and literacy, all in an attempt to control the remaining people who survived whatever happened to cause this apocalypse. The film doesn't go in to the cause of this new post-apocalyptic world, but instead focuses on how society keeps its shared historical knowledge alive in the context of complete brutal survival.<br /><br />I recently saw The Book of Eli for the first time in HD on HBO. What a stellar presentation I must say! I'm wishing now that I had seen the film in the theater on the big screen. The Book of Eli is absolutely fantastic looking! The cinematography, production design, costumes, and make-up are really well designed and executed. My friend Siobhan Roome was a part of the Art Department for the film as a set designer, and she did her job very well...along with the rest of the art department team. Production Designer Gae S. Buckley and The Hughes Brothers gave this film a look and feel like no other and executed their vision with incredible craftsmanship.<br /><br />Director of Photography Don Burgess really showed off his talents with the cinematography as well. There were a few shots that simply blew my mind with their composition and camera movement. There's one shot in particular that made me pause and rewind because I just hadn't seen it before. It's a 90-degree rotated pan with the horizon running vertically within the widescreen presentation. I wish I had a shot of it to share, but its better to see it the context of the film anyways. The gritty gray, black, yellow, and brown tones of the film perfectly reflect the barren desert topography and apocalyptic atmosphere that the story is telling. Burgess and The Hughes Brothers really gave The Book of Eli visuals that I'll never forget and compare every future movie within this genre against.<br /><br />The original music for The Book of Eli by music composer Atticus Ross is really well-suited to the story and an excellent listen all on its own. I've listened to the soundtrack on its own several times since watching the movie. My favorite track is \\"Panoramic\\" and it's \\"Eaten By Earth\\" remix. Along with his work on The Social Network (2010), Ross had an incredible year in 2010. Now that I know that Ross was behind the music from the short-lived USA Network TV show Touching Evil (2004), which I thought was an awesome show unfairly cancelled, I'm even more enamored with him. I clearly remember the feeling of the haunting music from that show. And apparently Ross got his start in the business with that series. Ross has a very modern style in his sound that feels fresh and exciting. I'm really looking forward to his future work on David Fincher's upcoming remake of The Girl With The Dragon Tatoo (2011). He's been re-paired with Trent Reznor from The Social Network soundtrack, so the sound should be interesting to say the least.<br /><br />The plot and story of The Book of Eli was good. Like I said, it's a simple story, but well-executed by actors Denzel Washington, Gary Oldman, Mila Kunis and the rest of the supporting cast. Nobody's acting really stood out as superior within their careers, but they were all solid performances that served the story of the film. Oldman felt a bit like he was re-hashing his bad guy role from Air Force One (1997), but he is good playing a bad guy, especially with his heavily textured face. There were a few times during the film that I felt the pacing and plot weren't going anywhere and were just filling time. I think the film could've benefitted from a little more complexity in its plot and more focus on developing the emotional depth of the characters and how they got to where they are personally. Maybe more back story about their lives was needed. That being said, I still felt like there was enough depth to this story that it satisfied me. And combined with the amazing look and style of everything, I'm very much compelled to watch the film again on Blu-ray.<br /><br />I'm not going to give away the story, but I like the twist ending. I did not see it coming (no pun intended for those that have seen the film). But it worked for me even though I knew going in to the film what book Eli is protecting. I give The Book of Eli 3.5 stars out of 5. It's a very good movie that surprised me and gave me a very satisfying experience. One of the better films of 2010. The Hughes Brothers are talented directors that have their own unique vision as filmmakers and its pleasing to see them express it through their films. I'll definitely be curious to see what they do next.Evil (2004), which I thought was an awesome show unfairly cancelled, I'm even more enamored with him.

0805086846|4.0|Independently that this book is biased, one thing is certain: the final result of the whiete invasion was only one: the Indians lost it all. Be it for lack of discipline and union among themselves, for inferior weaponryt, for naivety, for traitor that allied with white men, whatever. The sheer fact is: the land was theirs. White people took it by force, in order to make money. That's it.<br /><br />Of course, there were good white people; of course there were bad Indian people. But, up until the publication of this book, the publishing market was flooded with books only about the good white people. There wer almost no books about the goods Indian people and the BAD white people. That's what the writer tried to fix. That's why the book looks so biased toward the Indians.<br /><br />In general, white people from imperial powers spread disgrace wherever they landed, be them Spanish, Dutch, Portuguese, French, German or British. It's a known truth. What Spain did to maias, incas and astecas, for example, was far worse than what Americans did to Indians. But the overall purpose was always the same: stral the natives of their land, their minerals, their food, their wealth, and amke it all ours.<br /><br />This is indeed a classic, one that has stand the test of time. You'll marvel when knwoing about all the great chiefs and their noble fight or even their noble surrender. You'll cry witnessing one by one of the tribes falling down to oblivion. You'll fell sorry that the US Army was capable of having in its rankings some obnoxious officers (every Army has them)...<br /><br />A great book. Even if it is biased (on purpose, I think), it's a great book.
B000050IE6|5.0|Gotta love this album.  Definitely one of Opeth's best.  I think this is their first truly excellent release.  Some of the older stuff is good, but this is where Mikael & Co perfected their distinctive style.    \\"The Moor\\", \\"Godhead's Lament\\", \\"Moonlapse Vertigo\\", \\"Serenity Painted Death\\", & \\"White Cluster\\", all between 9 and 11 mins each, go through so many changes per song that it takes numerous listens of each to get a full appreciation.    \\"Benighted\\" is a slower acoustical piece in the vein of \\"Harvest\\" or \\"Hours of Wealth\\" or \\"Burden\\" or anything on \\"Damnation\\".  \\"Face of Melinda\\" is another slower song, but the conclusion is much heavier than \\"Benighted\\".  If you like \\"Face of Melinda\\", then check out the live version on the Roundhouse Tapes.    If I had to say something negative about the album, it would be that the last song, the 10+ minute \\"White Cluster\\", really doesn't add anything new.  It's decent enough song but by this point I start losing interest and often don't listen to it.  But having said that, I still find this to be a 5-star album that I listen to often.
B0049GYXDQ|1.0|I cannot begin to describe how unenjoyable and dull this movie was to watch.  Even as an adult, I've always loved Disney - Lion King, Aladdin, Hunchback, Mulan, Beauty and the Beast, to name but a few - and I was so excited when I heard that Disney were releasing a new movie.  I didn't get chance to see this at the theaters, so I pre-ordered this as soon as the blu-ray was announced, and couldn't wait to sit down with my husband to watch it.    I really don't understand why the movie has such high praise.  Based on the reviews given on Amazon, I was extra excited to see this movie, expecting something enjoyable even if not quite a classic.  Perhaps the movie is better suited to children (though I really doubt I would have enjoyed this any more as a kid) but I certainly could not find a single thing to like about this movie.    The storyline was promising-I thought that the slightly original twist on the classic \\"Princess and the Frog\\" story would be a guaranteed hit, but it was so poorly executed that it all fell flat.  The characters were forgettable, and for the most part, I didn't like them (except for the crocodile, who had some funny moments at times).    The artwork didn't really appeal to me-I found it a bit drab and boring.  The music was forgettable and the songs----awful!  A lot of them didn't seem to add much to anything at all, there were far, far too many of them, and not one of them was memorable.  I cannot even hum a single line of tune or remember any of the words at all.  The songs of this movie are nothing like the classic tunes of Aladdin, Lion King, etc.    One thing that really hindered this movie was that there were far too many characters.  I felt as though Disney threw in as many characters as possible just to make up for the poor script, weak songs and boring story.  A lot of the characters felt pointless, and the whole movie felt crowded.  Because there was so many of them, I didn't care for what was happening to any of them.  A certain scene at the end, which I believe was meant to be effective and moving, just left me thinking \\"oh well.\\"    This movie was difficult to get through.  It had promise at the start, but quickly failed to deliver.  I felt as though it were the longest 90-something minutes I've spent all year.  In fact, it felt more like 900 minutes.  My husband and I cheered when the credits finally came around, and not because the movie was any good at all.    Final note:  Avoid!
B000MD9UJC|1.0|I read all the reviews and decided to buy this item in hopes that it worked as well as some said.     The tail cap assembly screwed in just as expected.  The LED took some force to insert and while the instructions showed a + and - sides I could not see any marking on my 15+ year old Mini Mag.  Once I inserted the LED it did not work, I reversed it and it and then it did work.  Then the need for the manual adjustment.     With the old Mini Mag you would turn on/off the light by screwing in/out the reflective bezel.  When I assembled this the reflector would push down on the LED assembly and turn off the light.  I shaved an 1/8\\" of material off the reflector and then it worked, but only fairly well.  The light will go on and off if you move it around or depending on how you adjust the head for spot/wide beam.      It might be my 15+ year old mini mag, but I will not be buying another one of these, for the price you can look at a decent Nebo or Fenix light.     Mike in CT
0525951652|5.0|Wow, quite a variety of ratings for \\"Fall of Giants\\". So you're wondering if you should jump into this trilogy by Ken Follett, and based on the huge spectrum of ratings presented in these reviews, I doubt my adding to the mix will help much, but here goes anyway. I will say that it seems that most of the poor ratings stem from the price of the ebook and not for the content of the novel, which seems like a pretty asinine way to make your complaint? Why drive potential fellow readers away from a wonderful story by driving down the rating of this fantastic novel? If the ebook is too pricey, pick up a used copy here for just a couple dollars.<br /><br />If you read Follett for the romantic subplots, the love stories interlaced throughout the greater tale, you may be a bit disappointed Sure, there is plenty of romance, sexual encounters, illicit affairs, out of wedlock pregnancies and scandalous behavior in \\"Giants\\" (would you expect anything less from this author??) and the relationships play an important part in the overall story, but those aspects of the story take a backseat to the main story of a changing world plunging head first into the Great War.<br /><br />If your favorite parts of \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" were the political aspects of getting the great Cathedral built, and the politics played by the Priors, Tom the Builder and Bishop Waleran, then you will love \\"Fall of Giants\\". The focus of this novel is how life is forever changed with World War 1. The politics of a world at war, the revolutions, the backstabbing, the wheeling and dealing of politicians, military officers and would-be revolutionaries. And as always, Follett creates a memorable and enjoyable cast of characters.<br /><br />The scope of \\"Fall of Giants\\" is simply enormous, and it's setting the stage for a larger tale which will be told in two later installments. Follett does a fantastic job of explaining how the world was drawn into a war no one wanted, leaving millions dead, and a way of life changed forever. And while the war and its effects on all walks of society is the main focus of the story, Follett does a fantastic job of covering the Russian Revolution, Women's Suffrage in England, as well as the deeply flawed Treaty of Versailles.<br /><br />If you are a fan of Historical fiction, this is a MUST HAVE. I cannot wait for the next installment!ile the war and its effects on all walks of society is the main focus of the story, Follett does a fantastic job of covering the Russian Revolution, Women's Suffrage in England, as well as the deeply flawed Treaty of Versailles.

B000000OMJ|5.0|I've been a Peter Gabriel fan ever since I was a kid and saw the vid for Shock the Monkey.  Over the years I had collected all of his work on CD, but somehow I missed this one until very recently.  No idea how that happened.  Better late than never because now I have some \\"new\\" PG tunes to listen to!!!    I will say this is an improvement over his first 2 self-titled albums; the first 2 PG albums are good, but are not on this level.  The production is better here too.  Such a great album!  There is not a bad song on here.  This is one of those rare albums that can be listened to cover to cover without skipping a track or becoming bored.    \\"Security\\" has long been my favorite PG album, but on initial impression I will say this album is on par with that one.    Highly recommended.

B0043GN6XK|5.0|Antonio Vivaldi's opera ERCOLE SU'L TERMODONTE (Hercules in Thermodon) has received one of the finest performances on record.  The three act opera with libretto by Antonio Salvi was first performed in 1723 in Rome where due to a special papal edict preventing women from appearing onstage in Rome, it premiered with castrati singing all the female roles. Vivaldi was both conductor and solo violinist. In this recreation of the work, rarely heard or seen (except in the 2006 very controversial Spoleto Festival performance captured on DVD with Zachary Stains as Hercules au natural), Fabio Bondi has reconstructed  the work into a critical edition and also conducts the Europa Galante and performs the solo violin parts.<br /><br />According to one synopsis, 'the story is based on the ninth of twelve legendary Labors of Hercules. To atone for killing his children in wrath, Hercules must perform twelve labors, the ninth of which is to travel to Thermodon and capture the sword of the Amazon Queen Antiope. (In other versions of the story, the quest was for her magical girdle.) The Amazons were a tribe of female warriors who put all their male children to death. Hercules, accompanied by the heroes Theseus, Telamon and Alceste, attacks the Amazons and captures Martesia, daughter of the queen. The Amazons then capture Theseus and, as soon as Queen Antiope swears to sacrifice him, Martesia falls in love with him. In the end, the goddess Diana decrees the marriage of Hippolyte with Theseus, prince of Athens, and of Martesia with Telamon, king of Ithaca.'<br /><br />What makes this recording so brilliant (in addition to Fabio Bondi's considerable work) is the stellar cast of singers, a cast that would be impossible to match elsewhere.  Some of the finest Baroque singers of our time here capture the beauty of this piece.  The members of this production are as follows, here shown with the original voices assigned by Vivaldi to the roles:<br /><br />Hercules (Ercole) tenor - Rolando Villaz&oacute;n (in very fine voice after his vocal cord surgery)<br />Antiope, Queen of the Amazons mezzo-soprano castrato (en travesti) here Vivica Genaux<br />Martesia, Antiope's daughter, soprano castrato (en travesti) here Diana Damrau<br />Hippolyte, Antiope's sister soprano castrato (en travesti) here Joyce DiDonato<br />Orizia, Antiope's second sister, soprano castrato (en travesti) here Patrizia Ciofi<br />Theseus, prince of Athens, contralto castrato here Romina Basso<br />Alceste, king of Sparta, soprano castrato here Philippe Jaroussky<br />Telamone, king of Ithaca, contralto castrato here Topi Lehtipuu<br /><br />It is to Biondi's credit that he was able to assemble such a stellar cast.  There is not a weak voice among them, and selecting brilliant excerpts for comment would have to include arias by each of these talented artists.  Villaz&oacute;n is surprisingly fine as Hercules, and Joyce DiDonato is a standout. Phillippe Jaroussky is the only countertenor in the ensemble and that works very well for the overall cast.  Topi Lehtipuu is superb and that is mentioned only because he is less well-known in roles such as this as the stellar members Ciofi, Damrau, Genaux and Basso.  In all this is a very dramatic, very surprisingly new sound for Vivaldi, proving that he not only basked in his glories but moved into new arenas of composition in this work.  The entire production is without flaw.  Highly Recommended.

B000005AYM|5.0|Many people feel that \\"Baduizm\\", when first released, was criminally overlooked. While it is still remembered in passing, it certainly made a huge impact upon release, especially due to its lead single \\"On and On\\". It also remains one of the best debut albums by a female artist in recording history, although not many listeners own this album to verify the truth in that statement. In a perfect world, `Baduizm' would have gotten more respect and been a landmark record; but it is still rather underground (surprisingly), and not many people remember anything other than the lead single. A pity, because the whole thing is stellar.<br /><br />I consider this record to be a landmark moment in R&B history, alongside a few albums that redefined the genre. Those are \\"Now\\" by Maxwell, \\"Who is Jill Scott\\" by Jill Scott, and works by D'Angelo and Angie Stone. All of these had their high moments, but track for track, none of them had as high a quality as Baduizm. Erykah herself would go on to make better albums - her sophomore record \\"Mama's Gun\\" is in every way superior to its predecessor musically (although eschewing its stripped down production for more of a big band approach), \\"Worldwide Underground\\" was a still-unknown epic that outfunked Macy Gray, and \\"Live\\" remains probably one of the best live albums ever released in the genre.<br /><br />As a document of the late `90s, you couldn't do much better than this. A brief look at other reviews will also prove to you that this CD has a certain timelessness that never makes it feel dated. In this respect it is quite similar to \\"The Velvet Rope\\" by Janet Jackson or \\"Am I Not your Girl?\\" by Sinead O'Connor. This is good news for people who like to live with albums, experience them, and grow with them through life, and Badu is a perfect candidate if that's the sort of long-term approach you have towards music. A must-have, obviously. There are two editions of this album - the original, and a new re-release that has a bonus disc of extended editions and remixes - go for the latter and you'll have the full Baduizm experience.<br /><br />Five Stars.<br /><br />Track listing:<br /><br />\\"Rimshot (Intro)\\" (Badu, Madukwu Chinwah) - 1:56<br />\\"On & On\\" (Badu, Jaborn Jamal) - 3:45<br />\\"Appletree\\" (Badu, Robert Bradford) - 4:25<br />\\"Otherside of the Game\\" (Badu, Bro Questlove, Richards Nichols, James Poyser, The Roots) - 6:33<br />\\"Sometimes [Mix #9]\\" (Badu, Nichols, Poyser, The Roots) - 0:44<br />\\"Next Lifetime\\" (Badu, A.

The songs I refer to are The Book of Love, Rockin Robin, and the Ballad of Paladin. I'm sure there are others that are left off but I can't remember them at the moment. Now perhaps there is a delux edition of the soundtrack out there with the missing songs on it, but as far as I'm concerned the soundtrack is incomplete.
B000089770|4.0|This is a very thoughful movie. The highlight is the scene in which our friend the tobacconist shows the Pulitzer Prize winning author his collection of photos. The interaction is profound. The scene is all about \\"seeing through the eye rather than with the eye.\\" Annie Dillard would approve. In an age of superficiality and frantic busyness we can learn that \\"we won't get it if we don't slow down.\\" And it's not only slowing down the speed at which we move that is important, but giving ourselves the opportunity to live more contemplatively. We live incredibly frenetic lives which cause us to experience all sorts of problems. But we were created to live in the moment, not pump our bodies so full of adrenaline that we can't sleep. The whole movie is worth watching, but this one scene alone is worth the price of the entire film. Have a look.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|I have a lease on our property and as of now they have not drilled. The lease conveyed with the purchase of our property.  We have no say about what happens to this land and the prior owners got all the lease monies. We were wrong in that we did not understand what the drillers do to the land.  We were told it would be minimal and a big yea to the energy company making things better. Now each day I think of our trees, soil, water, animals, nature itself being destroyed. I am glad to see a film that gives us the real truth.
B003X2O6KW|5.0|No matter how you feel about Kanye West, you've gotta open your ears and really hear the sheer genius he puts on display on this album. Not only did he take his artistry to a new level, but he is one of the few people who are taking hip hop to a new and better direction; he proves over and over again that hip hop isn't about just about watered down lyrics, simple drum machines, and a fad dance. Not since \\"The Love Below\\" by Andre 3000 have I been in awe of the broadness of hip hop. His work in \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" is like a quilt with parts of sampled music, horns, strings, drum machines and laced with music's finest. Breathtaking! I Love This Album!!!
B003YFIUW8|5.0|It is Jack's fifth birthday. Him and his mother live together-in 'Room'-ever since Jack can remember, and too long for his mother to stand it. A tale told by a boy who knows not what the world lays in store for him-in a sense that far surpasses how we take the phrase to mean. Unremarkable. Only Donoghue could write something like this. Surpassing my own expectations, I do not know how to put into words the serious art that this book just simply IS. Everyone should at some point in their lives read this one! Kindle, new, used, gift, whatever-get yourself a copy! You will quickly find yourself emerged not being able to put the book and images out of your mind!<br /><br />FIVE STARS HANDS DOWN!
1603420398|5.0|i am satisfied with the sellers service and the arrival of the book. when the book had water damage to some of the pages; the seller notified me to let me know and made it right for me, which i appreciated the options i was given by the seller.  i would recommend this seller.

0525423273|3.0|I picked this book up after many mentions by John Green in his popular vlogbrothers videos.  I figured, hey, a new YA novel, highly recommended by an awesome author?  Sure, I'll give it a try.  The writing in this novel is spectacular, I'll give it that.  As John Green said, it is like he and Maureen Johnson's writing had a baby, and that baby was this book.  However, when it comes to the story itself, I wasn't thrilled.  Don't get me wrong, it was a cute story, but good?  Meh.  Anna and the French Kiss falls back on typical YA tropes, and maybe I just read too much YA lit, but really?  A French boarding school with a hot guy who just happens to have a British accent?  It's starting to sound plot-wise like the very Nicholas Sparks (I'm assuming it was Nicholas Sparks, although I could be wrong) novels Anna makes fun of.  I felt like too much of the focus was on the love trianglequadranglepolygonthing, rather than the story potential.  I would have loved to get to know Meredith, Rashmi, and Josh more, rather than having them serve as a flat, background cast of characters.  The issues the characters had with their relationships with their parents would have been another fascinating thing to examine more closely, particularly St. Clair's relationship with his father (who, while mentioned, doesn't come into focus until the last few chapters of the story, at which point, everything seems rushed).  It was nice to read a fluffy YA novel reminiscent of Meg Cabot, with added maturity in both character and writing.  I'm still really saddened to see such good writing potential not used to its fullest though.  I'm excited to see Stephanie Perkins' writing develop, and I will definitely be picking up Lola and the Boy Next Door upon its release!<br /><br />Rating: 3.5/5
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I bought this for my wife.  She loves it.  We put in both the DVD and Blu-Ray versions at the same time (different TV inputs) and compared the quality and color.  It was like night and day.  The DVD version almost looked like black and white in comparison to the rich color of the Blu-Ray my wife was really excited.  We love the subtitles, the old DVD version didn't have any.  It was a great buy.  The only thing I haven't liked is it rolls the credits between episodes.  I'm hoping there is a way to turn them off, but I haven't fiddled with it yet.  It's not a big deal, just kind of annoying.
B004LK5CEE|5.0|Always been a fan of this longer cut of Almost Famous since it appeared on DVD several years ago. Broke down and bought the region free import blu-ray, but the picture was washed out and very soft (plus the soundtrack was lacking). Decided to risk getting this version from Best Buy (pretty cheap) hoping Dreamworks did a better job than the import did. Boy, did they ever!! This is one fantastic looking and sounding blu-ray! The colors really shine in this hi-def release. The DTS-HD audio really kicks in during the concert footage with plenty of bass. Very glad to see this finally get released in hi-def here in the states, wonder why it took so long? This blows away the drab looking DVD of this cut of the film (originally called Bootleg) with the visuals and sound. This is well worth the upgrade! Don't understand why it seems only a few people are selling it on Amazon. Got mine at Best Buy for well under 20 bucks...and its worth it!! The only version here is the longer cut, does not include theatrical cut.<br />Rock on!!!
031250926X|5.0|This is my 9 month old's favorite book. Just pulling it off the shelf brings a smile to her face, and she loves to look at the terrific pictures and slide open the 'door' to the next animal. Just a great book.
B003EVBCW2|5.0|I found the Tallest Man on Earth through my recommendations on last.fm - he is recommended if you listen to Bon Iver, Okkervil River, Fleet Foxes, Blind Pilot and Great Lake Swimmers, and of course he is reminiscent of Dylan because of his voice.  He writes and plays beautifully and I can't stop listening - I highly recommend this album.  Love is All, King of Spain, and The Wild Hunt stand out, although the whole album is quite lovely.  I had initially downloaded the album to try for free, and decided to buy it to support a wonderful underground (in the US anyways) artist.
0670022411|5.0|I saw a short review of this book in Parade magazine, pre-ordered it and started reading it the day it was released.  I was instantly hooked.  In so many paranormal books, you have the beautiful girl, tall handsome vampire yada yada yada, the girl and the vampire were there, but their story is so rich and filled with historical depth, that it is like reading an actual account of witches and vampires.  I was drawn into the lives of multi-faceted characters and their families and felt a kinship with them.  Another positive is that this is a lengthy reading experience.  I like that in a book, so many want to wrap up a storyline in 350 pages. I desperately hope that is was the first in a series.  Deborah Harkness, the story of Matthew and Diana must continue!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|Best movie ever in my book own it love it. Heath ledger is the man...... he plays the joker to the extreme and delivers a Oscar performance. Bale does good as Batman but the star is the joker aka heath ledger. Great story line. Amazing action and just pure adrenaline throughout.
B000PC6A3E|5.0|A great story. Goes into the beginnings of Batman, and the development of his history. The sound and special effects were among the best I've ever witnessed. A little long, but I never left my seat!  If you have not viewed this movie, I would definitely recommend you see it. I feel that I more than got my moneys worth. My wife is not a Batman fan, but she said actually enjoyed it!  JB
B004HAG40O|5.0|I'm not as succint/intelligent in my reviews as others here are so I'll just put it like this. This album is more in spirit to the sound of the first 2 (and IMO best) albums, just simple pop songs again. I like the prog-rock/symphonic stuff on Picaresque and Hazards of Love but Colin Meloy's true talent on this earth is his gift for amazing melodies, not trying to turn the Decemberists into Yes. Easily the best album since Crane Wife, if u can though get the Bridesmaid EP's that came out in '08 or '09 I think I'm not sure but that is some of their best work ever.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|West Wing is well-written and perfectly acted.  You're hooked from the first scene on. Loved the characters and story lines. You won't be disappointed if you buy this series.  Best show on television!
B0041KKYD8|4.0|I Spit On Your Grave is a great remake. It successfully brings the original to modern eyes with memorable performances and satisfying kills. With everything from rape to brutal torture, the unrated release was the only way this could be released properly. With such unlikeable characters, the comeback of Jennifer is a satisfying one. Butler's performance throughout is a bulldozer of emotion. This shows one woman's many character's Anger, sadness, retribution, and, intelligence. Compared to the original, there is no comparison.
0385504209|5.0|This is a book that has you on the edge of your seat for the entire storyline. Dan Brown does a wonderful job connecting historical facts with fiction. The tale and the race against time is a thriller in itself!
B000002P2V|5.0|Is this the best we've heard from The Who? Not really. Is it a flawed album? I guess it depends. Will it ever be forgotten? I hope not.<br /><br />Who Are You is a bit different than the band's earlier albums. This time, there's a bit of a mix of punk, blues, and progressive rock. This might not please every Who fan on this planet, but to me, this is still as good as Who's Next and By Numbers. With only \\"Guitar and Pen\\" as a major weakness, the songs are musically and lyrically miraculous. My favorites are \\"New Song,\\" \\"Music Must Change,\\" and \\"Trick of the Light.\\" The rest of the songs range from very good to just plain awesome.<br /><br />Sadly, this is the last album with Kieth Moon, who died just a few weeks after this was released. Despite his troubled life, he will certainly be missed.<br /><br />Grade: 9.4/10<br /><br />Also from The Who<br />Who's Next (9.5/10) [[ASIN:B000002OX7 Who's Next]]<br />The Who by Numbers (9.2/10) [[ASIN:B000002P2W By Numbers]]

B00004SA8A|5.0|Time defies explanation. Anyone who thinks that it can be encompassed with flimsy words such as seconds, hours and days is an Epsilon at best. Kempff in Schubert is the fearless Mariner of this mysterious current. His D 960 - as it was in the beginning, is now and ever shall be - is a masterly illumination of 'heavenly length' but in a way that can only be experienced, not explained. Forget the notes and bars: when does it really begin and end? I do not know. It's unfathomable. Here is the bird; this is the key.<br /><br />Here are some thumbnail sketches:<br /><br />D 960 - as above: will never be surpassed. It was not recorded in the usual sense with microphones in a studio - its origin is sub specie aeternitatis.<br /><br />D 959 - lacks fire compared with Perahia [[ASIN:B0000026O5 Schubert/Schumann: Piano Sonatas ~ Perahia]] or Brendel II[[ASIN:B00000E2Q6 Schubert: Piano Sonata in A, D. 959; Hungarian Melody in B minor, D 817; 16 German Dances, D. 783; Allegretto in C minor, D. 915]]. A respectable performance but not a frontrunner.<br /><br />D 958 - Staier comes close [[ASIN:B0000A1M8A Schubert: Late Piano Sonatas: D958 & D959]] but Kempff owns this sonata. His treatment of the interlude in the last movement is weightlessness itself.<br /><br />D 894 - Fine as Kempff is, Brendel II is more enlightening, particularly in the all important finale [[ASIN:B00000E3UR Piano Sonatas]]<br /><br />D 850 - Kempff's performance is as miraculous as D 960 above. Not to be missed. It merges with eternity in the final bars.<br /><br />D 845 - There are plenty of fine performances of the A Minor in the marketplace and this is one of them.<br /><br />D 840 - Schubert as Bruckner and Kempff is his prophet. Look no further.<br /><br />D 784 - As per D 845 above. A fine performance that has not monopolised the market.<br /><br />D 664 - another miracle of this set. Kempff as his most magical.<br /><br />D 625 - ditto.<br /><br />D 568 - Stately and serene, this is magisterial playing.<br /><br />D 566 - what a work. Another peak in this cycle. Art as artlessness. One cannot imagine that he even practised it.<br /><br />Most of these performances exude alchemy. Sure, there are more virtuoso readings elsewhere (such as Pollini) but in this instance, mundane considerations apply not.<br /><br />This cycle was coined by Eternity; alternatives are mere gymnastics.Most of these performances exude alchemy.

6305692572|1.0|I created an account just to possibly prevent someone from wasting their time on this film. This is what happens when Disney tries to tackle serious subject matter I guess. It is ridiculously over the top and cheesy. Ironically, a great drinking game to play while watching this film would be to take a drink everytime you find yourself thinking: \\"What? That makes no sense\\" or simply rolling your eyes or groaning at the cheesyness. A lot of people say Meg Ryan is too pretty to play the part but it's actually that she's horribly directed and puts in a really unsubtle performance as does everyone else in this film. The eldest daughter who is apparently 10 is also badly written in that she often speaks like a woman in her 30s which I guess we're supposed to find cute but I find distracting. It is so blatantly hokey and tries so hard to pull your heart strings that you end up resenting it for insulting your intelligence.  Instead of watching this film, it might be more pleasant to become an alcoholic, ruin your life and then go through the detox process. Save yourself. It's too late for me but save yourself!
B00338QENI|5.0|The author seems to have done really good research, not only on Henrietta and her family, but especially on the science and history background/context of the story... it is a very well rounded book.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I liked the movie, very much.  Altho it's one of those movies you have to pay attention to who is who so you can see how they connect. It's a movie I would sit and watch with my neices.
B002ZG976U|5.0|This is what musicals are all about. The remakes are great, and the original songs are awesome. Cher's torch song is the centerpiece of the movie, and Christina's Bound to You is one amazing love song. The acting is wonderful, there isn't a weak link in the cast, and it was just nice to go and see a movie that lived up to what it claimed to be.
B002N5KVDG|5.0|Jello Biafra has supplemented his intriguing spoken word career with a variety of musical projects, but this one should be given the time to blossom on stage and in the studio.<br /><br />The hardcore attack from guitarists Ralph Spight and Kimo Ball, drummer Jon Weiss and bassist Ralph Spight provide Biafra with the best venue since the one-off \\"supergroup\\" No WTO Combo to hammer away with pointed lyrics on the dysfunctional and corrupt political scene. It is no surprise that two of the tracks - \\"New Feudalism,\\" \\"Electronic Plantation\\" - were penned for the No WTO Combo, with live versions released in 2000. The real fun and games inside The Beltway are uncovered on \\"The Terror of Tinytown\\" and \\"Clean As a Thistle.\\" The dungeons of the prison-industrial complex (\\"Three Strikes\\") and the quest for everything under the sun (\\"Strength Thru Shopping\\") - while slapping down plastic cards in the air-conditioned mega-centers of pop culturism - seize the spotlight on the second half of the album. The anthem for a new century - \\"I Won't Give Up\\" - has a gap of around seven minutes after its conclusion for the sonic cliff notes of the proceedings.<br /><br />The package is complete through the album/CD art and mini-poster that includes the song lyrics. Meet the new boss, indeed.
0670022411|1.0|I saw a short review on this book and thought to give it a shot, I hated Twilight, I read two books and gave up on the series due to the stupidity of the characters, lacking of connection, etc.. and poor written, so I thought that this book would give me pleasure reading it, the writer seems a mature lady, the start is great, intriguing, the mystery about the manuscript, the witch, everything seems falling in to places, and then the mature witch with so many degrees started acting like a stupid teenager with a crush, I know that we need to have love, sex, tension, etc,,,but please put it in a mature way, not like hormones driven teenagers running around and playing with each other, what the heck? I hate the lack of ending for the book, we don't need another series of vampires books, we need a well written book about the subject with and end. I hated that we couldn;t get an explanation of the mystery and the author just want to make some extra bucks, not from me. I'm recommending all my friends not to buy this book now, because it is a trap to buy another one and another one without storyline, but just some adults acting like kids. What a pity, this could be a very pleasant book and unfortunately just left a very bad impression of poor written literature.
B004AHNIGM|2.0|I wanted to like this CD, and the sound clips convinced me to order it, but once I got the CD, I regretted it and re-sold it.    This is slow country songs mixed with old time blues.  I was tired of it after just a couple of listens.

B003JTHXN6|5.0|Delivering Happiness is basically one giant advertisement for Zappos, but don't let that put you off from reading this entertaining and inspiring book. Prior to reading this book, I didn't know much about Zappos other than it being an online shoe retailer. Now, I see that it is much more than a just shoe retailer. It is a company with a strong culture focused on not just customer service, but also developing relationships, having fun, and delivering happiness to its customers.<br /><br />The first section of the book opens with Tony Hsieh at nine years old hoping to be an earthworm farmer. After that failed attempt (since this obviously isn't a book about Tony the earthworm farmer), he relates story after story about his many money-making schemes. His parents touchingly indulge Tony in all of his business ideas. Some of his ideas failed, but some actually succeeded. I loved reading about Tony's childhood. All of his stories were humorous, charming, and above all, inspiring.<br /><br />The book then continues with stories of Tony's college days and his co-founding of LinkExchange, a company that Microsoft acquired for $265 million in 1998. About a quarter into the book, Zappos enters the picture. In the remainder of the book, Tony discusses the early days of Zappos, the personal risks that he took for the struggling company, and the many life lessons that he learned along the way. It is an entertaining and inspiring quick read. I highly recommend it.

B0009PEYGM|5.0|Long having been a lover of Bach's 6 solo cello suites, with over 20 recordings in my collection (and counting), I was captivated with these recordings when I placed them on my player to listen to.<br /><br />Talk about fresh air, interpretation, etc., this set is an eye-opener that I highly recommend to lovers of these seminal Bach works. Truls Mørk presents us with deeply reflective interpretations of these greatest of all works for solo cello, illuminating areas of these suites that many artists play in a rather two-dimensional state for a more introspective view. This is a wonderful revelation, seldom displayed in recordings of these great works.<br /><br />Further, Virgin have captured an acoustic atmosphere that is totally fitting for these performances, taking them to another level of musical expression/enjoyment/dimension. They were recorded in Riks Church, Oslo, in July 2005, and surely producer, balance engineer and editor Rita Hermeyer is to be highly praised for this wonderful spacious and acoustic sound presented here. It seems as if one could reach out and touch the instrument, feel the original sound waves/vibrations from the strings, and witness Mørk in his traversal of these monumental works by \\"Herr Bach\\", genius of the stringed and keyboard instruments. The sound is slightly \\"dry\\" perhaps, but the \\"living dimensionality\\" that has been captured and preserved here is truly notable.<br /><br />I give very high praise, indeed, to EMI/Virgin for the great insight to have captured these stellar and deeply reflective renditions of these pieces.<br /><br />Further, Truls Mørk himself deserves mention for his unique highly personal interpretation, adding further dimension to these pieces, and also for adding another benchmark set to the catalog for our unending enjoyment of these gems of the baroque repertoire.<br /><br />Trust me, you need to at least hear these recordings even if you should decide not to purchase them for your collection....they ARE that good.<br /><br />Enjoy!<br /><br />~operabruin
B004GHYCKW|5.0|It is entirely appropriate on an album largely dedicated to the theme of \\"war\\" and the carnage of battle to compare Polly Harvey to the musical equivalent of the army scout. She is an artist who bravely advances out into the territory miles in front of the battalions behind her keenly aware of the dangers this involves but nonetheless fearless in terms of seeking an opening into new and lusher pastures.. Harvey ticks all the \\"i\\" boxes. She is the most inventive and intuitive musician operating in UK music and for that matter one of the most intriguing artists on the planet. Her now famous appearance in front of former Prime Minister Gordon Brown on the BBC's Andrew Marr show has been commented on widely standing bedecked in feather boa's with a tape of the Four Lads' novelty hit \\"Istanbul Not Constantinople\\" looping over the excellent xylophone riffs of the title track of this new album (although the Four lads sample has now been dropped). It undoubtedly cemented her fearsome reputation as a blues-rock sorceress with a direct line to the dark forces and subversion. Harvey has of course dismissed the myth making around her but there is no denying her impeccable musical journey informed by such great artists such as Captain Beefheart and Patti Smith and which has included stellar collaborations with Nick Cave and Thom Yorke.<br /><br />\\"Let England Shake\\" marks another stage in one of the most fascinating musical journeys in rock music. Harvey is a dissonant and challenging musical chameleon able to change the colour and tone of her music from album to album and this work in particular stands as almost a complete break from the earlier brutality of albums such as \\"Dry\\". The fabulous dimension is how good the songwriting is on LES despite being an album haunted particularly by the ghosts of the First World War it is packed with \\"great tunes\\". Her lyrical images are striking particularly in the blues lament \\"Last Living rose\\" starting with the great lines \\"Godamn Europeans, take me back to beautiful England/ and the great and filthy mess of ages/and battered books and fog rolling down behind the mountains/ on the graveyards of Dead Sea captains\\". The gorgeous echo laden ballad \\"All and Everyone\\" builds with huge force and is strewn with war and deathly imagery over its six minute journey. \\"This glorious land\\" starts off with the bugle signalling a charge and this is followed by one of the best melodic songs she has ever written. \\"Written on the forehead\\" bares some comparison to the ambience achieved on Mercury Rev \\"Deserters songs\\" as it floats over a detectable reggae beat drawn which injects the words \\"Blood and Fire\\" while the refrain \\"Let it burn let it burn\\" is repeated over and over. It hardly sounds like a barrel of laughs but it is a beautiful song. The last song \\"The colour of the earth\\" is centred on the shambolic Dardenelles campaign of 1915 and the on-going Australian open wound that is Galipoli a sort of war folk song with an almost Pogues flavour.<br /><br />Granted \\"Let England Shake\\" is on times a strident blood tinged album about anger, destruction and war but it is neither overtly politically \\"in your face\\" or full of screaming cacophony. It balances skillfully dancing between the twin dangers of being a patriotic tome or equally tolerating any xenophobia. It is a warts and all address to us all on some very big themes not least on the largely acoustic song \\"England\\" where despite the regret strewn through the songs course she admits \\"Like water, like air/To you, England, I cling/Undaunted, never failing love for you\\". The album is also packed full of inspired touches such as the lift of the line from Eddie Cohrane \\"gonna take my problems to the united nations\\" in \\"The words that maketh murder\\" to the Kate Bush like beauty of \\"Battleship Hill\\". As ever Harveys' long time collaborators John Parrish and producer Flood are all over album like a rash in a very positive way.<br /><br />Every now and again an album comes along that amounts to a gamechanger, after it is released nothing is ever quite the same and it becomes a reference point for other artists as a well of inspiration and a catalyst for new directions. P J Harvey's \\"Let England shake\\" is one such album. Some big names are due to release albums in 2011 and it will be fascinating to watch whether anyone can match this astonishing record since it will require a small miracle.s to a gamechanger, after it is released nothing is ever quite the same and it becomes a reference point for other artists as a well of inspiration and a catalyst for new directions.

0440244870|5.0|This is easy, breezy, fun reading at its finest! LOVE this book. Kinsella's style is so cute, you just want to root for the main character throughout even though she's so disastrously flawed.    That's what makes the characters so great -- they're not perfect! They're real, and even though some of the comedy is just silly, it's still LOL! and appropriate for the tone of the book.    You won't regret picking this one up.    As for the awful movie though, that's another thing...
B003YCI1PM|5.0|This is a great CD, she is one of my new favorite artist.  The songs mean so much, and her voice is just beautiful.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I have not been a big Kid Rock fan except for a few songs here and there but I can not stop listening to this album. It is fantastic and actually shows what he can accomplish as an artist without rapping and cursing. I find the songs in my after I listen to them for hours on end. For some reason it's catchy and you'll no regret making this purchase a part of your music collection. I didn't. I am so glad that I gave it a shot.
B00192IV9U|5.0|This album has been surrounded in controversy the minute after news that the album would be released spread.  Then, Breaking News was introduced to the world on MJ's official site, and the controversy just got bigger. Hold My Hand came out soon after, and the controversy subsided somewhat. Following the two songs, primarily a bunch of the songs was previewed on iTunes Ping, and the whole album itself was leaked to the world, a week before the album was to be released. So, is this album horrible or worthy of being titled \\"Michael\\"? Let's see. Since Michael is not here to tweak these songs, the highest score I can give to each song is 8/10.    1. Hold My Hand (ft. Akon). A great and inspirational tune, and when MJ says \\"Hold My Hand\\" at the end really makes you cry.  But, this song features a bit too much Akon, which leads to me to think that this song should have been called Akon ft. MJ, not a duet between Akon and MJ... But again, MJ is not with us to add more vocals, and all we have is this piece. 7/10    2. Hollywood Tonight. Now this is more like it! A hymnal at the beginning, MJ beatboxing, an explosive melody, which all gets you dancing from the start. But, after the spoken bridge, the song just repeats itself, and loses momentum. 7/10.    3. Keep Your Head Up. An inspirational tune which deals with financial struggles. Again, not even close to Man In the Mirror, Heal the World, Earth Song, or even Cry. 7/10    4. (I Like) The Way You Love Me. This song was released as a demo on the Ultimate Collection, but that time, it was just a demo. Now, it's a finished product. One of the best songs on this album, the part at the beginning with MJ talking to some recorder is a nice touch, and the song is a breezy, calm song which makes you want to kick back, and relax. 8/10    5. Monster (ft. 50 Cent). I feel this is one of the best songs on the album. The rap by 50 Cent is a nice touch as well. People keep saying that Keep Your Head Up, Monster and Breaking News aren't him singing. Read my comment for Breaking News to see why I differ. 7/10    6. Best Of Joy. I absolutely love this song. MJ wrote this all by himself, and it is one of the last songs he ever wrote and recorded. This song, which was to be premiered at the This Is It concert, ends with \\"I am forever\\", which makes you smile every time. 8/10    7. Breaking News. OK. Where to begin? MJ's fans divided. Did he sing this or did an impostor do it? Well, guess what. It IS him. The skeptics say that his vibrato is way off and that his voice is deeper than usual, while the people who believe it is him keep on citing the piece 2000 Watts to prove that it is him singing. Well, let's face it. MJ was almost 50 when he recorded this piece. It's two years after the child molestation charges. He's tired, and he's old. Face the fact. When you get old, your voice vibrates a lot when singing. That's why his vibrato is off. He's not 20, 25, 30 or even 40. He's 50. You think the greatest musical genius ever doesn't age? But, other people keep on saying that in This Is It, his voice wasn't vibrating as much. Well, he probably wasn't in a good condition when he sung this piece. But mark my words, IT IS HIM! As to the melody, I love it! 8/10    8. (I Can't Make It) Another Day (ft. Lenny Kravitz). Recorded during the Invincible sessions, MJ decided to save this song for later because he felt it was too rock for the Invincible album. Written by Lenny Kravitz, this song oozes passion, with MJ's vocals shifting from tender to fierce. 6/10    9. Behind the Mask. I love this piece. His voice is so youthful and energetic. Nice beat, nice vocals, gets you hooked the very first time you listen to this piece. Not his own song, but a cover version of the Yellow Magic Orchestra's original track, with some additional lyrics by MJ. 7/10    10. Much Too Soon. Just beautiful. Written in the Thriller Era, his vocal on this one is so heartfelt and emotional. Absolutely love it. 8/10    Total Score: 73/100. Remember the highest score for this album would be 80/100, not 100/100 in my rating system.    * * *    MJ fans have been waiting for this album for a long time and its here. This album turns out to be a very good way to celebrate MJ's legacy, and a great way to show what direction and what songs MJ was recording in his last years. But it must be stressed that it is no where close to Off the Wall, Thriller, Bad, Dangerous, HIStory, and Invincible (despite some saying it's much better than Invincible). Of course not. MJ isn't alive. But for a posthumous recording, this is pretty good.
B00364K6YW|5.0|My husband and I watched all 6 episodes in 1 sitting. It drew us both in and would not let go. Colin Firth, in particular, was wonderful. As usual, his face alone said more than the script. Many fine performances by all who took part.
B00275EHJG|5.0|After watching this film I have to admit that the Toys are my favorite Disney characters ever! In this one, Andy has grown up and is preparing for college. The toys are worried that they will be thrown away as Andy is no longer interested in them. Only Woody is sure that Andy would never do that. In fact Andy packs Woody to take to college with him and sets the other toys aside to put in the attic.    Andy's mother accidentally thinks the toys are meant for the garbage and puts them out. Only some last minute action by Woody and TRex save the toys from being garbage fodder (this is an omen of a larger danger later in the film).    Andy's mother than thinks the toys were meant to be donated and she then takes them to a day care center. The toys at first thinks they have arrived in Heaven because they meet a whole bunch of new toys led by a big pink teddy bear who tells them they will be played with all day.    Unfortunately, things are not as good as they seem as the daycare starts looking like a prison and dangers abound. There are a lot of touching moments in this film and don't be surprised to shed a tear or two.    I really enjoyed this film as much as the other two. The authors have made another fun and original story and all the toys still have the same voices, except Slinky Dog whose orignal actor passed away. On the DVD extras, the new voice of slinky dog is the original actor's friend and he tells how he imitated the original actor's voice. Also, on the extras we get to meet the voice of Andy who is the same actor (now in his 20's) who needed to be tracked down and luckily was delighted to do the voice again. Ned Beatty is the pink teddy bear, Michael Keaton plays a \\"sleazy\\" Ken doll and Whoopie Goldberg even has a character.
B004CR5TD0|4.0|Last year James Blake came completely out of left field with 3 EPs that left a pretty large dent on the blogosphere. Each had a different style to them, but I think that each was building toward the sound Blake has on this album; his own unique take on dubstep and minimalism.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Unluck\\", which is pretty disorienting and complex in and of itself. It's easily one of the album's more difficult tracks, which kind of leads me to wonder why he chose a song so difficult to open the album, when a lot of the remainder is more accessible. It's not that I dislike the track, I just wonder Blake's intention. Easily the best moments of the album come when Blake blurs the lines between the abstract and the straightforward; \\"The Wilhelm Scream\\" is perhaps one of the best examples of this. It's dichotomy of lushness and emptiness is also a strong suit of the album; some songs are very quiet and meandering (in the good way), others build into a frenzy of noises.<br /><br />Blake also has a clear ability to craft pieces that are sheer beauty; think the two-part \\"Lindisfarne\\". He even makes room for a jazzy piano interlude. And how can I forget his voice? He has the soulfulness and elegance of other great singers like Justin Vernon or Antony Hegardy. And some people are hating on his use of autotune; my rule of thumb for that is only use it if you can use it creatively, and I think Blake certainly does that. These abilities really cement Blake as a musician in the truest sense.<br /><br />So I'm liking the album so far, but there is one major speed bump; tracks \\"Why Don't You Call Me\\" and \\"I Mind\\". The former begins as the same kind of track as \\"Give Me My Month\\" is, a track I like. But in the middle of the song, Blake goes on to edit and cut-and-paste his own song to the point of annoyance. Unfortunately, he goes even further with that on the latter track. He doesn't seem to be doing much more for me than showing how good he can chop up a track and make it indiscernible, while not making it a whole new \\"song\\". I know he's done this kind of thing before, and it worked back then because it didn't SOUND messy and indiscernible. I just end up being far more interested in Blake's compositions rather than his toolbox.<br /><br />But thankfully that's only one small section of the album. For the most part I'm enjoying this a lot; not blown away, but I still like it. A lot of people are sort of complaining about the fact that the two most promoted songs on the record are covers, but that doesn't really bother me because for the most part, everything else is good too.<br /><br />TRACK PICKS: The Wilhelm Scream, I Never Learned to Share, Lindisfarne, Limit to Your Loveot making it a whole new \\"song\\".

1439107955|5.0|Richard Rhodes's \\"The Making of the Atomic Bomb\\" sets a benchmark for popular histories of science and against this \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" measures up well.  No dry science here - Dr. Mukherjee provides an absolutely fascinating history of cancer research, as he effectively weaves together the science, the story of researchers and physicians, and several cases in which he has personally been involved.  This human dimension brings the science alive.  \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" is equally effective in making a technical subject approachable and leaving you with a hunger to know more about both the science and the scientists.  The reader not only learns about the genetic mutations driving cancer, but also the Greek carpet salesman who develops one of the most widely used diagnostic tests for cancer and the scientist who ingests bacteria to demonstrate his theory that it is a precursor to stomach cancer.  We all know someone plagued by this horrible disease.  \\"The Emperor of All Maladies\\" will leave you with a deeper understanding of what that now means and what that has meant through history.
B003PIUBZS|3.0|I love \\"Rome\\" and would love to see more of the same.  I even got really into the horribly dated \\"I, Claudius.\\"  That said, the initial reviews were that this was the stupidest thing ever created, and that kept me away.    I think that's an accurate representation of the first few episodes, which are horrible nonsense that feel like poorly done garbage along the lines of \\"Xena, Warrior Princess,\\" but with a slightly higher budget and frequent ripping off of the look of \\"300.\\"    However, the show (and reviews!) improves over time.  Xena (technically Lucy Lawless, but she'll always be Xena) leads the way in depicting the catty and devious upper-class, trying to strive upwards on the coattails of Spartacus' success.  It's not at all historically accurate and it doesn't try to be, but it can be kind of fun.    Hurting this is that even though the upper-class machinations become a larger and larger part of the show, even to the end it still revolves around the gladiators, and my god do they get boring.  It's all so predictable, you know exactly how every scenario is going to play out.  Their fight scenes are incredibly repetitive - you've seen one, and you've seen them all.  It's like something a 12 year old would come up with, replayed over and over - sword through the throat, women in audience lower shirts in approval, 3 gallons of blood fly in slow motion, and the expected winner wins.

B000SMWUPS|4.0|I read all of the reviews on this product as a parent console for the stroller and I thought that it might do as a child's tray as well.  I'm currently pregnant with our third child and we're purchasing the City Mini Double Stroller.  We love the stroller but the accessories have to be purchased separately and they are not cheap.  I definitely wanted a child's tray for my two older children (6 & 2 1/2) to use while in the stroller but I didn't want to spend a fortune.      I decided to try out the Sunshine Kids Buggy Buddy because of the good reviews and the awesome price.  When the Buggy Buddy arrived I tested in out on our Sit n' Stand stroller and was very impressed!     PROS:      1. It can be collapsed and thrown in the stroller basket without taking up valuable space and is flexible so it doesn't affect folding the stroller, whether attached or stowed in the basket.    2. It has a pretty sturdy wire frame all around the top so that it holds it's shape and supports the items inside.    3. It is large enough to fit two Sippy Cups or bottles, and snacks or toys.  It even has a small zipper section that could be used to store pacifiers or other small items.    4. The Velcro straps are strong enough to secure the Buggy Buddy around the bumper bar of the stroller.  It stays in position without sliding along the bar or falling off while moving, if secured very tightly.    5. The fabric is super easy to clean if there are any spills.      6. Can be attached on either side of the bumper bar of the stroller.  This way it can be placed in the position most convenient and most comfortable for your child.  On the Sit n' Stand it works best attached to the outside of the bumper bar with our older children.    7. It can also be used as a parent console, its original purpose.  I love products that can be used in multiple ways!    8. Because of the wire and flexible fabric it should work with a variety of stroller types.  So, when my older children do not want to ride in a stroller and I go back to using a single, I can still use this product.      9. The pockets are deep so that the items are less likely to fall out when going over rough terrain.    CONS:    1. A younger child may enjoy kicking the Buggy Buddy and some of the items may fall out.  But, the tray can always be taken off and stored underneath the stroller when this becomes a problem.      2. It does not hold open drink containers without spilling them.  This is not a huge problem for us since we primarily use closed drink containers for our children (Sippy Cups, baby bottles, water bottles, etc.).  For the parents we have purchased the Munchkin Stroller Cup Holders to attach to the stroller handle and they work okay on smooth surfaces.  We plan on upgrading in time to the Baby Jogger Liquid Holsters (for the parents) which according to reviews do not spill liquids as much when going over bumps and rougher terrain.    3. It does not have a hard surface to double as a high-chair-tray-on-the-go.  This can be easily remedied in two ways.  One, bring a hard lidded container to fit inside the Buggy Buddy for messier food items. *Benefit: leftovers can be stored away for later. Two, use a disposable stick-on placemat to create a feeding pocket in the middle of the Buggy Buddy.  *Benefit: easy clean-up, just pull off and out with all the food leftovers safe inside and throw away. Also, these can be purchased in a super handy pop-up travel case.    OVERALL:    For the price, I think this is a fantastic product.  I am excited to try it out with the City Mini Double Stroller and hope to update my review overtime.  Thank you to Sunshine Kids for providing a quality product for a reasonable price!

B003Q6D25K|5.0|I grew up with Poltergeist, the Omen, The Shining, Amityville Horror, etc.     Special effects hadn't even been invented yet. They were never intended to create a huge empathy for the characters. The plots themselves were minimal and spared you from too much depth. They were simply filmed to make you jump and have that girl next to you hold you tight.     This movie took me back old-school and that's why I liked it. Those who go deep in discussion about all this movie lacks are probably also dissatisfied that they don't find a diamond in a tootsie-roll pop. It's a scary movie. That is all and it's wrapper has no false advertising.

0345505387|5.0|I really enjoyed this book!  I highly recommend it for any Outlander lovers, any graphic novel lovers, and anyone looking for something new to read.  (I really recommend that you read Outlander the novel either before or after. If you at all enjoy the story in The Exile, you'll love the full novel)  I thought it was really interesting to get another perspective of a story that I already know so well, having read Outlander more times than I care to admit...lol.  A highlight for me was getting to see more of Murtagh and his motivations, and comings and goings during the story.  And the artwork was just beautiful, and seeing the characters as Diana sees them was sooo cool!  Was the story simplified?  Yes.  Was it another version of Outlander, a story we already know?  Yes.  But this book brought so many new things to the table. Firstly, we got to see what Diana sees, after all these are her characters, and while we all have our own picture in our mind (wonder how many people think they look like Claire, or their husbands resemble Jamie...lol), its pretty cool to see what they \\"really\\" look like.  As to the artwork, of course the characters look slightly different in different panels, no one looks exactly the same all the time.  Not to mention, its for entertainment purposes, not to revolve your whole life around!  Some of the reviews on here are frightening with how personal people are taking this!  Everyone has the right to their opinion, and there's no right or wrong answer, but goodness, there's no need to say things like, \\"I can't believe you wasted our time when you should be writing what we really want\\".  I'm just as excited as the next fan for book 8, but I'm also excited and grateful for the other stories she writes.  She's just an amazing writer in general, and all the Outlander spin-offs are so interesting.  Secondly, its pretty cool to see what was going on when Claire wasn't there.  We had never heard the details of the raid the night Jamie met Claire, never known what happened to Jamie when he went to meet the deserter, or exactly how he got into the Fort to rescue Claire, never knew what Jamie was thinking/feeling when the story was being told by Claire.  Not to mention all the things that went on that Murtagh was involved in!  Pretty cool to find out another piece of the story!  I found the new perspective to be fresh and interesting, even though it was within the already told Outlander story.  I think its neat to know what the other characters were doing/thinking/feeling.    Anyway, I digress, my point was to say that while the graphic novel format may not be everyone's cup of tea, it's something different that Diana's never done in the Outlander series, and if started with an open mind, quite enjoyable.  I hope all Outlander fans give it a chance and take it for what it is, something different, a new perspective of an already cherished story, but not how she's going to write every book from now on. And I hope it draws new people into reading the books that may have never even heard of the series before.  Change can be scary, but hopefully some of the die hard Outlander fans can try a little harder to keep their opinions about the book itself, and less about their expectations and demands of future projects.  Yay for Diana!  I can't wait for what's next, whatever it may be!

0307271862|5.0|i discovered henning mankell and ian rankin, among others, as mystery authors as a consequence of being a fan of michael connelly and his character harry bosch and seeking other authors who have created their own flawed detective characters. i've finished the john rebus series more or less in chronological order and read \\"the pyramid\\" prequel and the first two wallender novels, \\"faceless killers\\" and \\"the dogs of riga\\".    i mention this because moving from connelly to reading rankin's works which in some ways had less personal character development but more emphasis on illustrating different issues concerning scotland and the UK prepared me to be more appreciative of how mankell is as much if not more so a philosopher using the mystery genre as his vehicle than a mystery writer per se. mankell has described his wallander series as \\"novels about the swedish anxiety\\", that is, observations about the tensions between democracy and the welfare state with wallender being mankell's mouthpiece. (i wish the liberals still wanting to turn the US into a version of sweden would read the wallender series with a regard for critical analysis.) had wallender merely published a series of essays, they would have probably gone unread and never been translated.    i should also point out that while i was born and raised in the US, my parents emigrated from the region of southern china that provided the bulk of the chinese workers that built the transcontinental railroad over a century ago. for those who hail from western cultures, it may be difficult to grasp how deeply ingrained the concepts of family, community & ancestor worship are in chinese culture. while the villain's desire for vengeance is certainly extreme, it's not such a suspension of disbelief for someone of my cultural background.  ==========  starting with the image of the wolf, mankell uses this book to make observations about colonization, past and present. while some may quibble over a few details concerning beijing, the extent of capitalization of third world africa performed by china is well documented, if not well publicized. i have no doubt that mankell has observed the influence firsthand as a resident of mozambique.    with all that preamble - i enjoyed the book, i liked that it prompted me to consider things i had not had much reason to consider before. for those who just want to read a thriller as a diversion, this may not be the book for you, despite the intriguing premise, upon which i will not elaborate for fear of spoiling it for others.    i look forward to mankell's next work, whose plot is allegedly going to involve a woman who moves from africa from sweden and somehow becomes the owner of a brothel.i look forward to any potential observations about prostitution and possibly slavery.

B003U0AHBO|4.0|The style of this tale is not like Errol Flynn in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD nor even the Kevin Costner in ROBIN HOOD: PRINCE OF THIEVES.  In fact, the idea that Robin Hood was more of a commoner goes back to the older legends of Robin Hood before the spin that he was the Earl of Huntington.  There's little about stealing from the rich to give to the poor and more of a focus on political intrigue with an emphasis on the rights of the English Lords that would lead later to the Magna Carta of 1215.  There are also more historical accuracies than inaccuracies which is rare for a Hollywood film.  Many of named characters really did exist during that era and for the most part a good or better job is done by the actors and actresses.  Cate Blanchett's character, Marion, seems more 21st century values than matching for those times but without giving spoilers I suspect she wanted in on some of the fun, especially at the very end.  The romance was done better than expected and there are some well executed scenes. FAIRLY ACCURATE HISTORICALLY: William Marshall did exist as an advisor and was closer to the Mother Queen than King John; the Baldwins and Fritzes did exist as powerful noble houses; armor was a pain to put on and off as shown in one scene; brutal warfare; filthy people; grain shortages and a bad economy; corn references (bread was called this name back in the day); untrained Marian going down fast at the end battle; PROBABLY HISTORICALLY ACCURATE: the furniture; the clothes; a Scottish bowman while not likely seems possible; the festivities of commoners (lively and fun to watch); old ruins and Green Man; The Charter of the Forest (not the Magna Carta as some people are calling it) was after the Magna Carta and during the reign of King Henry III, son of King John (we are only talking about a couple of years here as the Magna Carta was in 1215 and the Charter of the Forest was 1217; I heard mention of this but not Magna Carta; whatever the case they combined the two when one built upon the other and under another king); the balls of fire on the castle gate could have been Greek Fire but that's really stretching it; women riding into battle was incredibly rare but did exist; NOT ACCURATE HISTORICALLY: the French being driven off the coast (many English Barons invited them when they were unhappy with King John; the French King has a claim to the English throne by blood; the French were there for a long time and they met with no resistance upon landing); the manner of King Richard's death (he didn't within seconds; he was slain by a crossbowman and not a cook and he forgave the boy but after he died some angry mercenary had the boy killed); a bowman using a big sword and riding a horse and impersonating a noble (unlikely); CHARACTER/DIALOGUE: B; STORY/PLOTTING: B to B plus; HISTORICAL ACCURACY FOR HOLLYWOOD: B to B plus; WHEN WATCHED: January 2011; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus (B plus to A minus if you want a fun movie and don't care about historical accuracy).

B000BSLU2S|5.0|I upgraded my kids' PCs with the fastest processors they'll take, but they started shutting down immediately afterwards.  I did some research online, and found out I needed to upgrade the cooling.  Problem was, these are low-profile desktops, and there's no room for bigger heatsink/fan assemblies.<br /><br />I figured I'd take a shot at using really good thermal paste, so I got the Arctic Silver.  I carefully cleaned the CPUs and heatsinks of all residue (using baby wipes dipped in Isopropyl Alcohol), and applied the Arctic Silver.<br /><br />After buttoning everything back up, I fired them up.  These machines have variable-speed fans, and they were going full jet blast before.  Now they stay quiet, and the machines run great.  100% success.

B003FVI2KQ|5.0|The 1090T was AMD's best production processor when I bought it. The 1100T is just a clock boost, and still has the same amazing features. Encoding movies at 1080p takes only about 20 minutes, and nothing outside of that even stresses this processor. Turbo Boost is an excellent feature that helps with many programs that don't support all of it's cores, and AMD Overdrive allows you to configure the amount of Boost. I've never had a problem with this processor, and it performs almost as well as the best i7, for less than a third of the price.     Note: If you're planning on using this processor for video encoding, editing, or things like that, make sure to get an awesome cooler. I bought Corsair's H50, but had to add an extra fan to keep it cold while all cores are maxed out. If you aren't going to use all of it's cores, than cooling is no issue.
0670022411|5.0|A Discovery of Witches sparked my interest and then grabbed a hold of me and didn't let go!  The proof is in the details in this book. Rich with history and science the reader is transported to different times and the descriptions of the teas and wine were so delightful that I thought I could almost taste them.  Definitely a great book.  Can't wait for the sequel.

0740797719|5.0|Amazing book! I recently finished my degree in illustration and this book is worth far more in terms of teaching me what I need to know than my university education was. I have his imaginative realism book too which is great but this one is even better! Not only are James Gurney's illustrations simply stunning, he's obviously also a great teacher, he explains things very succinctly and clearly, making it very easy to grasp the concept he's talking about and start to apply it to your own work. Each double page spread explains a different concept to do with light and colour with his beautiful illustrations as examples. The way its organised is great and information is very easy to find, I have it sitting next to my computer for handy reference. I really couldn't recommend it more highly.
B0014DBZT2|5.0|The strongest effort so far by Nick and Seeds. Every song is an A++ winner - 'More News From Nowhere' has got the best bass line I've heard a hell of a long time (Grinderman's 'No Pussy Blues' bass line ain't too shabby, neither). I've had DIG!!! on my iPod since I bought it and haven't taken it off since - that's 3 years. GREAT STUFF..
B003EYVXSW|4.0|I like horror movies.  That's why I decided to see Splice.  Plus, I like Adrien Brody; he's always interesting.  That said, I must admit Splice is less a horror movie than it is a syfy/nerd fan-boy extravaganza.  Wow!  Dren, the weird, yet somehow attractive combination of stuff that should never, ever be combined, is one busy little creature.  Some of the more graphic stuff was hard to watch, but for the most part the story moved like a freight train on fire, with one strange plot twist after another. I think the reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because it wasn't enough of a horror movie.  Yet it was scary.  And Brody is a good enough actor to pull off a good reaction to all the odd happenings - without throwing his hands up and crying, \\"What? This is nuts!\\" Altogether pretty good.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|The acting was good; the story was interesting. It is important to remember this is \\"fiction.\\" Whatever the \\"truth\\" is varies among the participants.  But if Roger Ebert likes a movie, it must be good!
0596009208|5.0|I started learning Java a few years ago, having had previous experience with C++, PL/SQL, ActionScript (Flash) and even assembly language.  For some reason, even with books by Paul and Harvey Deitel, I found that I was not sure of what I was doing in Java.  I could read the code and tell what a program was doing, but was having a hard time creating the new objects, interfaces and methods I needed for my project.    My wife bought this book for me and I didn't have the heart to tell her that a \\"silly\\" book on Java would not help me get where I wanted to go.  How wrong I was!    The authors make it seem like they are very casual, even irreverent, about the subject.  However, they actual do imbed the concepts into your mind with silly poems (roses are read, this poem is choppy, java is always pass by copy - or something similar) and crazy \\"debates\\" between objects and concepts.  The light finally came on about what objects living on the heap was all about and that declaring an object variable is really declaring a reference to an object.  Wow! so that's why you need an object.equals(object) method instead of just using object==object.  The other books pointed that out, this book MADE the point in the brain.    I could provide lots more examples of how apparently silly games make the concepts live in your brain instead of just on the paper, but you really should experience it for yourself.  I fully intend to investigate the other Head First books that are relevant to my work.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|This cd is like stepping back in time. Gone is the great wall of music that Springsteen is using on many of his \\"current\\" songs. Just his clear voice in just about all of these songs. Also the best lyrics ever in Candy's Boy-\\"We loved each other till there was nothing left and we drove that old car as fast and hard as she would go\\" Takes you back and reminds you of the reasons how/why Bruce Springsteen became the boss!<br /><br />You won't be disappointed with this cd.
B004FPE4DK|3.0|Successfully blends soul and R and B phrasing with folk music. A series of intimate, haunting songs that are written well and recorded with style and passion. A unique songwriter who shows tons of promise for the future!
B003YFIUW8|3.0|Room was interesting enough, written well enough, exciting enough......but nothing about it was particularly special for me, which to me is what merits 4 or 5 stars. I liked the characters, was hoping they managed to get out of the situation they did, which is good...I want to like it more than I did (which is an odd sort of sensation) but I found myself thinking that it was just ok; kinda resoundingly, frustratingly ok. Soooo....if a friend ask me if they should buy it, the most I could muster would be, \\"It's ok, you might like it but there is better stuff out there.\\"
B00006IU73|5.0|\\"In Absentia\\" is one of the the best, may be the best, album of Porcupine Tree.     It contains silent, psychedelic Songs, with an influence of 60s Psychedelic Music and also modern Electronic Music on one side.     On the other side it contains powerfull \\"Alternative Rock\\" at its best. New on this album is the strong Heavy Metal influenced guitarsound of Bandleader and superb guitarplayer \\"Steven Wilson\\". I heard he hang around with band members of \\"Opeth\\", so may be there is the metal influenced based. But not only him all other members of the band do a really fantastic job!    There are parts on \\"In Absentia\\" which are really heavy, so may is not the best album to start with. Or you like anyway Metal or excessive guitar players like \\"Robert Fripp\\" for example. If you like it more soft, look for \\"Lightbulb Sun\\".    The production and the performing of the songs is really fine. The Songwriting is excellent. There are many \\"pearls\\" on this album like: Blackest Eyes, The Sound Of Muzak, Gravity Eyelids, Wedding Nails, The Creator Has A Mastertape.    Porcupine Tree are marked as \\"Progressive Rock\\", but for me it is more intelligent Alternative Rock. There is still a little influence of early sounds of \\"Pink Floyd\\".    Anyway this album is really a masterpiece of Rock Music. And if youre not afraid of heavy guitars - enjoy it!
B003Q6D1YW|2.0|When this film arrived on my doorstep, I dropped everything I was doing and popped it into the player. I had read all of the hype about the releasing of this \\"Facebook documentary\\" at the same time as the \\"Facebook movie\\". I was drawn in by the hushed way that people spoke about the documentary and the fact that no one was willing to give a full plot detail. It is for this reason that I watched the movie hungrily waiting to be blow away. I was disappointed...greatly!    This film follows a young artist who becomes interested in the artwork of an 8 year old girl, Abby, who lives in Michigan. As he becomes more and more entranced with her work, he starts a relationship with the rest of Abby's family. Eventually, he begins to date Abby's half-sister Meghan though they have never met and their only interactions have been through Facebook or on the phone. When he gets a chance to travel to the west coast, he decides to drop in on the family. As the date of the trip approaches, he begins to think that maybe he has been duped. He starts wondering if there even is an Abby and if Meghan actually exists. This revelation leads him to the family's doorstep where he is faced with the truth.    All of the hype surrounding this film made me think that there would be an intriguing twist that changes the viewer's preconceptions. However, I found no such revelation. Instead, I found the film to be another cautionary tale about Facebook and online dating. There was nothing new here that hasn't been covered on the Evening News or been the subject of a Lifetime movie. Additionally, there has been an outcry that the film is a hoax. I don't know if there is any truth in this statement; what I know IS true is that this film had a terrific ad campaign for a far from terrific movie.
B000JHUTVO|5.0|Had to pick it up for her because I tired of renting it.  She is going on 5 and yes in that lets watch it 500 times in a row stage.  Much like Jumunji, its predecessor, the movie is based on a very \\"old\\" game some kids find and begin playing, and then the \\"fun\\" really starts!  This fun takes them to space!  My daughter adores it, and the young boy Danny thats around her age.  She coveres her eyes when the huge robot appears, repeats the wordsshe knows by hearts, and simply loves this movie.  All kids will, its a great family film with amazing special effects.  Good action seqences for the boys and cute boys for the girls!  Real good family values for the family!  We enjoyed watching this together as one ourselves quite a few times and recommend it from ours to yours.
1439156816|4.0|It is no secret that I love Stephen King (or Uncle Stevie as he calls himself). While I have not read all of his works, I find his personal writings to be humorous and his insights into pop culture to be fascinating. It is for this reason that I snatched up a copy of On Writing. While I am not entirely interested in being an author, I certainly am intrigued by the process and thought that being guided through the process by King would be interesting. I was not disappointed.    While King's book does focus on the writing process, most of this book is filled with his personal recommendations on what has worked for him. This is not meant as a slight, for King is very upfront about his lack of expertise in writing a \\"writing manual\\". It is for this reason that the book is so effective. I found myself following his recommendations in my everyday writing. The examples that he uses are humorous while also able to prove his points.    Additionally, he begins this book with what feels like a memoir. In the first third of the book, King describes aspects of his childhood and adulthood that led him to becoming a writer. He does not shy away from his drug and alcohol addiction and in doing so he makes himself appear human. King does not ask the reader for sympathy or compassion. Instead, he uses his personal history as a way to prove that writers are not entirely pure and often take a winding road before coming upon their first book. As a fan of King, I was glad to read a bit about his personal life and upbringing. Of course it is nothing that isn't already on Wikipedia or has been spread across the news. Still, hearing his story in his own voice is beyond delightful.    Basically what a reader has here are two books: a memoir and a writing manual. King excels in writing both and I encourage readers to take a chance of this hybrid book. I doubt it will disappoint.

B0015DROBO|4.0|For me this book started off a little slowly but I am very glad that I stuck it out.  The mystery surrounding the murder of Harriet kept the pages turning.  Salander is an intriguing character and she certainly made the story colorful and exciting.  I really enjoyed this book and I cannot wait to read the next one.
1401310400|5.0|The book is as described on the website and arrived in excellent condition. It is based on the hit series Castle and is exciting and well written.... very entertaining!

They are vegan andcan be easily made gluten free. they are also egg free, cow's milk and dairy free and you can give them a twist to change them into a heaven for your own allergies.    The ingredents are easily found in any shop or orgic shop, the taste is just amazing and it takes a few minutes to bake yourself some treats to dribble for.    The book is packed with very helpful informations at the beginning about flours, mix, humidity impact on the cookies, conversions table and a trouble shooting section.    The recipes are creative and some are really amazing along with some great classics of the cookie world.    Those treats are cruety free and you can change the recipe and make them suitable for your diabetic parent.    If you are to buy one book to enter the cookie world, buy this one !  Awesome !
B00127RAJY|5.0|While I already see 2306 reviews for this DVD, i  cannot resist but give my word for it. As one of the reviewers rightly said, I wudn't feel bad paying even a 100$ for this excellent workout program!    I quit going to the gym almost a year back since I moved my job location. Having a completely sedentary job, and feeding myself all the fat I could find in the world, I gained like 15 lbs in no time. When all my lovely size 2 jeans gave up on me, and I literally had to go shopping size 5s I realized how badly i needed to get back to my regime. And that's when JM's DVD came to my rescue.    It's been around 20 days since I started using the DVD and all I can say is... it's become a part of my life now! believe me! I wake up every morning looking forward to that killer workout! yes I do call JM names when she makes me work out and toil until i think i'm gonna die, but when I'm done, I wana touch her feet! The kick it gives me! wow! nothing can beat it! I literally feel guilty all day until i have had a chance to spare those 27 minutes to do my 30 day shred workout. i won't say i've lost weight or inches yet, coz i ended up skipping 4-5 sessions coz of my terrible schedules (but i have promised myself to do better)... but! i HAVE become stronger... so much more energetic... i no more frown when i gotta lift heavy grocery bags or run to catch the train... in fact, i love it! i just see myself ready to spring and jump at every opportunity and simulate the workout in my daily life too!       well... enough said... u gotta see it to blv it!

B0000A118M|5.0|My opinions on this record are going to be nothing new than what's already been said. In case you are wondering, it IS everything that people have said it is and more. I would venture to call it the greatest jazz album of all-time (yeah, I like it better than 'Kind of Blue,' although both are great albums that you absolutely must own). I don't care what kind of music you like, whether it be punk, rap, electronica, '50s rock, I really don't care. If you don't own 'A Love Supreme,' buy it now. No matter how tight your budget is, buy it now. There are few albums that are truly life-changing experiences. This is one of them.    However, I will say this: DO NOT listen to this album in stages. Some albums (like 'Pet Sounds' by The Beach Boys) are great, but the songs can be listened to individually. Not so here. To fully appreciate the album, you have to actually *listen* to the album start to finish each time. Personally, I think any song (namely 'Acknowledgement') should stop appearing on compilations, because it just doesn't blend there. 'A Love Supreme' is more than just an album; it is a statement. It is the musical equivalent of what 'The Great Gatsby' is to American literature: it paints a picture in your mind. Almost like a landscape. That is the effect of this album. So, no, you can't just listen to one individual song here without hearing the others. It just doesn't work that way.    The music, on the other hand, is what the review on hand here is for. Well, what more is there to be said? It is so otherworldly that I don't think words can describe it. I truly don't. With Jimmy Garrison on bass, McCoy Tyner (he's still alive and tours frequently -- go see him if you get the chance, but that's a different review altogether) on piano, and the great Elvin Jones on drums, Coltrane has a rock solid backing section that compliments him perfectly. The quartet plays their absolute hearts out, and why Coltrane gets individual billing here is a mystery. The other three helped make this album what it is; this isn't a John Coltrane album, rather it is a John Coltrane Quartet album.    The chanting, the haunting musicianship, the staggering time changes, and the sheer complexity of the music on hand simply cannot help but immerse you in it. It's like a vacuum; it sucks you in. Regardless of whether or not you like jazz, you don't have a record collection (or a CD or MP3 collection, rather), if 'A Love Supreme' is not in it. It is just that simple. Coltrane was going places that nobody had never seen nor dreamt of by this point. The man is as brilliant as Albert Einstein, and I have proof to back up that statement: right here.    So, as you can see, I cannot get enough of 'A Love Supreme.' It's more than just an album. It is a statement. It is the musical equivalent of a painting. It sounds good regardless of what mood you are in. It's aggressive, but at the same time, it's soft, quiet, and almost healing. I can't help but listen to this album frequently. It's just too great of an album to not own. I know I'm repeating myself, but it is the absolute truth.     Is this my favorite Coltrane album? No. 'Interstellar Space,' the 1974 album that was released posthumously containing his free form February 1967 recordings, holds that honor. But that album is most definitely not for everybody. It is improvisational, and if you are a casual listener, it is nearly impossible to listen to and dig almost immediately (I did, but I'm willing to bet that the average person would not). The post-1965 stuff is definitely an acquired taste for many. 'A Love Supreme,' however, can be and should be appreciated by everyone. It is approachable, diverse, and ever so easy to appreciate. If you aren't in awe of Coltrane and his Quartet's playing by the end of the record, there is seriously something wrong with you.     Overall, this is perhaps the greatest jazz album of all-time. Is it my favorite jazz album of all-time? No, it isn't. But it's close. Very, VERY close. I can honestly say my life wouldn't be complete without this album, let alone my CD collection. Very few albums are deserving of five stars in my opinion, but on a scale of 1 to 5, 'A Love Supreme' ranks at 100,000. Yes, it is THAT great. But even saying that is an understatement.     Stop reading my review right now. Go buy it. It's that simple. If you don't have it, you need it. No human being should live their life without hearing 'A Love Supreme' at least once. I don't rank a lot of things 5 stars, but this album is more than deserving of it.     Highly, highly, highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend. Go buy it now. Don't waste another minute. Buy it and listen to the musical tapestry that is woven by the John Coltrane Quartet.    An ***ESSENTIAL*** album to have.
B00275EGX8|5.0|HURT LOCKER, THE<br /><br />STARRING: Jeremy Renner, Anthony Mackie, Brian Geraghty, Guy Pearce, Ralph Fiennes, and David Morse<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Mark Boal<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Kathryn Bigelow<br /><br />Rated: R<br />Genre: Action / Thriller<br />Release Date: 26 June 2009<br /><br />It pains me to say that I missed The Hurt Locker in theaters. On my first viewing of the film, I remember enjoying it but thinking it was not worthy of the Oscar for best picture over Up in the Air, Avatar or Inglourious Basterds. Having seen it recently for a second time that feeling remains intact; but now I can proudly consider it worthy of its place among the top five best films of 2009. If you haven't yet seen it, you seriously need to.<br /><br />The Hurt Locker holds a place dear to me on a few personal levels. The first being that it is an independent film (a world that I myself am entering into); and the second is that its story centers on soldiers fighting in the Middle East (something of which I have experience in).<br /><br />Jeremy Renner earns his first of two Oscar nominations as Sergeant James; an EOD bomb tech who is a little too proud of his work ethic for the comfort of his comrades. And for those of you who aren't familiar with the term EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal), they are an elite group of soldiers whose sole mission is to find and disarm bombs. And I'll give you another one up front: an IED is an improvised explosive device. The story takes place back in a 2004 Baghdad, Iraq.<br /><br />After their bomb tech is killed in an explosion, Sergeant Sanborn (Anthony Mackie) and Specialist Eldridge (Brian Geraghty) are awarded with a new one: Sergeant James. Eldridge and Sanborn had a good thing going, they work by the book, and they're but a few weeks shy of going home.<br /><br />So when James comes into the picture with his carefree tactics and cocky attitude; they are a little on edge. That James is efficiently skilled and gifted at what he does only makes matters worse for all three of them; because James is very aware that he posses these skills, and takes great joy in the adrenaline rush they reward him with.<br /><br />Sanborn and James butt heads from the get-go and Sanborn quickly realizes his last few weeks are going to be among his longest. Imagine working with someone who is very good at what they do, but their cockiness is sure to get you and them fired, and they don't seem to be the least bit concerned. Now amp up the volume on that little scenario by replacing the word fired with the word killed.<br /><br />James smokes frequently (even when handling dangerous explosive materials), he's all too eager to get his hands dirty when the situation doesn't necessarily call for it, and he doesn't seem to have much to live for other than the thrill of the job. And he likes to take his time when defusing these bombs, regardless of the fact that his team, himself included, are completely in the open and could be killed at any moment. The sheer fact that they are there to begin with, alerts massive suspicion to the townspeople.<br /><br />As nuts as this may seem, ask yourself if you were holding security for someone defusing a bomb; if you'd like that person to be as comfortable as possible when doing so. This is James' take on his work ethic, and it makes perfect sense.<br /><br />One thing you have to understand about the conflicts in the Middle East, whether it's Iraq or Afghanistan; the battlefield is everywhere. There is no safe point or zone; some are safer than others, sure. There is no one outside the wire you can fully trust: the enemy could be anyone, anywhere at any time, and they don't play by the rules. Harmless seeming objects such as cell phones, video cameras, and even kites, all have the potential of being tools of deadly destruction over there.<br /><br />The film rides on suspense driven scenes of: A. a guy defusing a bomb; and B. his security team surrounded by people who may want to kill them, may have the means to do so, and may be directly responsible and capable of detonating that very bomb. If that doesn't make for a good thriller, then I don't know what would.<br /><br />The Academy Award winning screenwriter (Mark Boal) spent time in Baghdad with a real EOD team and the film proves it. He nailed every detail from the soldier favorite juice boxes, to the Military jargon, to the shocking realization of just how far these people are willing to go to hide their IEDs in innovative ways.<br /><br />His goal here was not to make a big Hollywood action movie, but to tell a good story, and to stay true to the men and women who serve by keeping the film believable. There are a few Hollywood moments in the film for sure, but every single thing that happens could realistically happen in real life; maybe not to the same three guys, but hey.<br /><br />Mark's efforts are only matched perfectly by director Kathryn Bigelow who also won the Oscar for directing. They could have taken this project to a major studio who would have given them millions of dollars to film it in Arizona or Nevada. But instead they sought out investors overseas and filmed the movie independently and properly in the Middle East; and their hard work and commitment has paid off. There are six little shiny gold men resting on glamorous shelves somewhere, to prove it.ng that very bomb. If that doesn't make for a good thriller, then I don't know what would.

B0034G4OVS|5.0|This film was so sad. The scenes with them talking about their past and Parker with her pet, OMG, had me crying. And really, that's what this film focus's on. It's scary, but it's more about the connections between the characters and how they choose to handle the situation.    But that's what I liked about it. Because it wasn't what I had expected. There are no scenes with the ppl loosing limbs or anything that you might typically associate with a horror film.    The performances were pretty good actually, my fav being the guy who played Lynch.    Though the one question I had was, why did Parker's boyfriend jump straight down? That was the only scene that didn't make much sense to me.
B004DK5CW4|3.0|\\"Secretariat\\" (2010) traces the pivotal years in the life of one of the most famous thoroughbred race horses in history, winner of the Triple Crown in 1973. The horse was known as Big Red. His trainer was Lucien Laurin, played by John Malkovich in one of the few likable roles I have seen him in. He's usually a sneering nasty guy. When Penny Chenery's mother died, she hurried to her parents' Virginia home in order to comfort her father who was in the first stages of senility. The father lived on a large farm, and bred race horses, but it was financially a losing proposition. Her brother and her husband wanted her to sell out the farm and the stock. She was determined to hold onto the farm and horses because she knew how much they meant to her father. Her brother and husband were unsupportive and against her.<br /> This movie is not as involving as the two Sea Biscuit films because that horse was the underdog that became the favorite of the American people. Sea Biscuit was a horse that beat all the odds and triumphed. Except for one loss early on, Secretariat seemed to have it made.<br /> The dynamics of the family seem to be glossed over in this Disney film. When we first see the Penny's husband he seems autocratic, and we get a somewhat negative picture of him. In the movie he is pictured as being opposed to his wife's objectives. She is away for long periods training and racing the horse while he is left to raise two girls and two boys. The kids seem so perfect and so malleable that they never cross over into being real three-dimensional kids. It looks as if there is friction between husband and wife, and he is not fully supportive until the horse wins the second Triple Crown race. Something is not kosher in the relationship we are shown. The father and the kids are drawn in broad strokes, and the wife is the focal point.<br /> Secretariat lost a crucial race early on because of an infection, but from that point on it was full sailing. The drama of the jockey in \\"Sea Biscuit\\" made that movie so engrossing. This one is almost a study in how Penny was able to finance things and keep the horse racing. The movie doesn't have that much drama and thunderous conflict to keep you fully engaged.<br /> We see the loyal secretary Mis Ham, groom Eddie Sweat and jockey Ron Turcotte. Fred Thompson, former senator and Republican presidential candidate, makes a brief appearance and apparently had another commitment as his part was written out of the script. Secretariat was perhaps the greatest racehorse of all time, but the film, though a pleasant diversion, fails to sweep you away.made that movie so engrossing.

B000001ES9|4.0|Once upon a time, in the Toronto suburb of Willowdale, Ontario, three young men, Gary Lee Weinrib, Aleksandar Zivojinovic and John Rutsey (sadly deceased) blagged studio time whenever they could, and made their first recording.    Much later, Geddy Lee, Alex Lifeson and Neil Peart would become justly recognised (and the first rock band named to the Order of Canada by His Excellency Romeo LeBlanc, Governor General of Canada) for their musical innovations.    But here they were young, working musicians.  They liked Zeppelin, Jeff Beck, the Who and many other British bands of their day, and it showed.  No way is this the groundbreaking work they would later become known for.  However, it is FUN!    Whether blasting out of your car speakers or cranked at home, \\"Finding My Way,\\" \\"In The Mood\\" (Geddy's hilarious attempt at being a rock stud), or, of course, \\"Working Man,\\" are just good solid heavy blues/metal/rock songs.  That's a precious commodity these days.    The late John Rutsey was not Neil Peart.  Only Neil Peart is Neil Peart.  John was more of a solid timekeeper in the mould of Phil Rudd (AC/DC) with a dash of Ian Paice (Deep Purple).  And it fits these simple-but-entertaining rock songs.    I wouldn't recommend this as a \\"first taste\\" of Rush, but after you've sampled their other work, this is certainly a nice cherry on the sundae.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Seeing this movie I thought that I really would not like it, but I was very surprised. I knew that it won some award in Europe and I was skeptical because it was about a ballerina and I don't usually watch those types of films and I thought I would just watch it for the heck of it. Well I really enjoyed the film. It was elegant and the plot makes sense with weaving all of the important details in it. It is worth spending 2 hours of your time to watch it. You will not be disappointed.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I thought this book was masterful from the very first page.  The way science and mythology was entwined was particularly interesting to me, and I was frequently checking quotes and references.  The author developed a wildly compelling story and the only thing wrong is that the 2nd book isn't available right now!
0393338827|5.0|In the midst of an entertaining narrative you will learn, in simple language you can understand, what a credit default swap (CDS) is, what a collateralized debt obligation (CDO) is, how these things were used intentionally to obfuscate and multiply the financial risk, how the terrible lending practices of mortgage companies were encouraged because they were fuel, and so on, until, ultimately, all the rest of us picked up the tab while many of the protagonists went away rich.

B004EJUMT2|4.0|UPDATE:  After listening to this album more and more (mostly in preparation for seeing them live with Mastodon)......i'm really liking it more than my initial review, and the vocals don't seem as bad as before.  I've therefore upped it to 4 stars.  You really need to crank this at high volume for full effect.  Maybe the Satanic lyrics have put a spell on me and i'm now a disciple of Lucifer.  Hail Satan!!!<br /><br />This really was sort of a letdown.....let me explain. First off, musically I have no problem, this is good stuff. Not quite the intensity of Mercyful Fate, but nice precision metal thats well played.  Now the comparisons to Blue Oyster Cult are very true, and not in a good way.  Because the vocals sound EXACTLY like BOC's \\"Don't Fear the Reaper\\" style and in my opinion are just too weak for the music and ruin everything.  It's not BOC's \\"Red and Black\\" or \\"Hot Rails to Hell\\", it's the wimpy Cult which I never was a fan of anyway.  I tried to give it a few listens to see if I could get past it, or grow to like it, but it didn't work.  Shame, because with King Diamond and M. Fate MIA lately we could use a similar evil progressive metal band to fill the void. This just doesn't cut it.
B002ZG981E|5.0|The package is amazing, you get 2 bluray discs, the dvd and digital copy, for the price it's almost a gift. Buy other presentation of the movie only if you want the special edition with the suitcase and the spinning top because buying the regular one-disc one it's not worth it comparing to this one.
B003EYVXYQ|3.0|Before I begin, I should state that the worst George Romero zombie film is an order of magnitude better than the vast majority of competitors.<br /><br />That said, I think it's clear that Mr. Romero has run out of ideas.  \\"Survival of the Dead\\" is the first sequel to the unnecessary zombie reboot, \\"Diary of the Dead.\\"  The premise is that of a Hatfield/McCoy feud between two clans living on an isolated island somewhere off the Eastern seaboard.  Starting a few days after the initial zombie outbreak, the two factions fight over destroying the undead versus keeping them around in hopes of a \\"cure.\\"  The \\"shoot 'em on sight\\" clan leader (Kenneth Welsh, badly wasted) is exiled, and repairs to the mainland where he encounters some of the Army raiders from Diary.  They find their way back to Plum Island, and the fun begins.<br /><br />The theme of course, is that humans treat each other far worse than any of the zombies - great subtext, but the A-story has to be engaging and unfortunately it's not.  There are some nuggets of good ideas - one soldier becomes zombified in a novel way - but the \\"gags\\" are not realized particularly well due to the low budget and flaky FX.<br /><br />It's a shame, because in the 70s-2000s there were YEARS without a decent zombie film.  Now flesh-eating undead are so ubiquitous we are numb to a new entry from the man who invented the genre.  It doesn't help that \\"Survival of the Dead\\" is just plain dull at times.<br /><br />I'll buy it because I appreciate the effort behind making a nonmainstream, independent film...but I think we need a few years' break until Mr. Romero gets a great idea.  Sorry.
B003EYVXUU|3.0|I want to start off by saying if you haven't seen the original, please do yourself a favor and watch it before you see the American version. This version wasn't a bad movie by any means, even though the CGI was terrible and I didn't really understand the need for it, but the original is an incredible film, an all-time classic \\"horror\\" movie. The kids in the main roles in the first film were phenonmenal, their onscreen presence is unrivaled for 2 kids that age, the girl especially, I dunno, it's hard to explain without watching it...American Version so-so, Original, you'll never forget.

B003YOZNBU|1.0|I have not read any Jonah Hex comics. I saw this previewed at Comic Con and it looked interesting. The first indication that something might be off was Josh Brolin's tepid endorsement that went something like \\"some will love it, some with hate it, many won't understand it. It's good for what it is\\". I do enjoy comic adaptations and wasn't turned off by the supernatural elements (although puzzled by the \\"Snake-man\\" and the crows following Hex around). Basically, these were a bunch of mildly entertaining set pieces that had very thin connecting plots. There was very little tension, bad dialogue, character motivation that was thin (although the murder of their son and families should have been horrific, it generated no emotion at all). The gunfights had no tension, the set pieces were flat, and we really didn't care about anyone.<br /><br />Brolin did O.K. with a script that didn't ask him to do much. M. Fassbender was the most interesting character and had little screen time, Malkovich, whom I love, was not effectual at all. I don't know if it was the script, the directors or that they slapped this together, but it was the worse and most diaappointing movie I have seen in the last 12 months.<br /><br />I see good reviews posted here, I assume by 12 year-old Meagan Fox groupies, but trust most of the reviewers - it's really bad if you know what a decent movie should look like. But watch for yourself and then write your own review. Good luck!
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|I think you'll get many, many laughs out of RED. In the comic spirit of most of the James Bond spy movies that starred Roger Moore, this film has a great  daffy story that will make you feel almost satisfied with its ending.<br /><br />It stars a wonderful ensemble cast of your favorites and mine--Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich, and Helen Mirren--playing aging, retired spies who are confronting a powerful enemy. Mary-Louise Parker as the love-interest is a comic delight in a different way, Brian Cox is quite amusing as a very helpful elderly Soviet spy, and  Karl Urban does an excellent job in his role as an intense young adversary. It is great to watch the gang (including senior citizen Ernest Borgnine) going through their various schticks.<br /><br />The movie is based on some graphic novel I've never heard of, but neither have most other viewers. If I had to guess the authors, I would immediately pick that well-known team of old-timers who used to work for the Ethiopian Ministry of Information--Haile Implausible and Haile Amusing.<br /><br />SEMI-SPOILER ALERT: As in SPACE COWBOYS and ARMAGEDDON, one of 'em dies to save the others, and I won't say who or when or how--but if you know the movie industry's \\"rules,\\" you can guess 1/3 of this.<br /><br />ADVICE: This is great fun when viewed alone--but you'll have even more fun if you watch it with one or two good friends. Just agree beforehand on who gets to hold the remote to pause it, replay scenes in slow-mo, and turn up the volume.
0142000671|5.0|I have not read this book since high school (a long time ago), so I actually had forgotten how much I loved this book, probably more this time as it was read for pleasure.<br /><br />Briefly, Of Mice and Men, tells the story of two drifters, Lennie, a mentally challenged, gentle giant, and George, the man who looks after Lennie.  They are just two of the many itinerant labors who search for jobs in the fields of California during the Depression. George and Lennie hope that at some point, they will achieve the American Dream of owning a small piece of land and having a few rabbits as well, because Lennie loves small little critters and having something soft to pet.<br /><br />  'We're gonna have a little place,\\"  Lennie explained  patiently. \\"We're gonna have a house an' a garden and a place for alfalfa, an' that alfalfa is for the rabbits, an' I take a sack of it fulla alfalfa and then I take it to the rabbits.\\"....................\\"I like to pet nice things with my fingers, sof' things.\\"<br /><br />Lennie is extremely loyal to George, and although he has caused some problems as the two travel from place to place trying to find work, the one constant is that they have each other.<br /><br />  \\"I ain't got no people...'Course Lennie's a God damn nuisance most of the time, but you get used to goin' around with a guy an' you can't get rid of him.\\"<br /><br />George is often angry about some of the things that Lennie does, and feels burdened, believing that Lennie is holding him back in life.  Lennie, in turn worries that George may leave him some day. In addition to george and Lennie, there are some minor characters in this story: Crooks, Slim, Curley and Carlson, and themes of loneliness surface again through these men. Throughout this story there is a lot of foreshadowing which occurs, preparing the reader for a some of the bad things that are about to take place. There are several issues explored in this novel: the mentally challenged individual, poverty and racism, and although the characters here are different, their issues are often the same, leading each to experience many of the same disappointments in life.<br /><br />For those of you who have never read this amazing story (under 130 pages),  Of Mice and Men, packs a  mighty punch for such a small book.

B001UV4XFG|5.0|I love this book, but the movie let me down. They changed Bella´s behavior and for me ruined the movie.     I like the extras, the audio commentary with Rob and Kristen and the cut scenes.

B004GHYCKW|5.0|When you look at the majority of successful artists today, you see a pattern of not always conscious but nevertheless purposeful disengagement with the topics and events of world history. As the world heads closer and closer to disaster, the time has come for artists to begin to articulate the conditions of the world around us in thoughtful, meaningful ways. A historic allergy to being seen as \\"dogmatic\\", \\"political\\", or \\"opinionated\\" has now become a hysterical consensual myopia. The willfull vacuum of memory and consciousness that exists within the current artistic milieu - which rests on a bedrock of an ahistorical, asocial, utterly subjective, and individualistic world view, cannot be supported any longer. The situation is officially untenable. It is now the task of every artist of every shape and form to vigilantly observe, question, and articulate the conditions of our time. What was once a choice is now a prerequisite for making meaningful work.    PJ Harvey's \\"Let England Shake\\" is a masterwork that addresses the emotional, psychological, historic, and material subject of the last 10 years. Wars, unemployment, the recession, alienation of workers and specifically soldiers, the moral and spiritual degradation of the human populace, the ravaging of the land, as it were, is dealt with in a mature, sometimes achingly frightful manner that is appropriate to the madness that continues to be passed off as the natural order.    In press interviews for the album Harvey has voiced a concern against being seen as too overtly political, and that she would rather focus on the human aspect - \\"how human beings treat each other\\". But to be overtly political is to be overtly human. This is no longer a contradiction, and in her hearts of hearts, PJ Harvey acknowledges this, with every ounce of her will:    \\"How is our glorious country ploughed/Not by iron ploughs/Our land is ploughed by tanks and feet/ Feet/Marching/Oh, America/ Oh, England/How is our glorious country sown?/Not with wheat and corn/What is the glorious fruit of our land?/Its fruit is deformed children/What is the glorious fruit of our land?/Its fruit is orphaned children.\\"    She goes on:    \\"I've seen soldiers fall like lumps of meat/Blown and shot out beyond belief/Arms and legs were in the trees.\\"    On the final refrain of \\"The Words that Maketh Murder\\", she cries, \\"What if i take my problem to the United Nations?\\"     The answer is met with chilling silence.     \\"Let England Shake\\" is a masterwork. It is the kind of art that is completely in tune with the human condition - which, contrary to popular belief - is not timeless or atemporal. The work is now, here, and appropriately addresses the historic context and the heritage of conflict in gutteral fashion. The world cried, PJ Harvey has responded. Let every artist hear her call.
1595141979|5.0|I think Shadow Kiss might be my favourite of the Vampire Academy books. I don't know! It's so hard to decide, honestly. So good! But this book definitely had my favourite story line action sequence bit. And the tension/feelings between Rose and Dimitri seriously escalated in this book which rocked.<br /><br />After the tragedy in the last book, I was really upset. I liked Mason a lot and I was really sad he died. So the new development in Rose's life because of her being shadow-kissed kind of blew my mind. I loved the idea, and I love Rose's reactions to the new development. Seriously, it's pretty freaky.<br /><br />This book contained one of the things I was looking forward to most - the field experience test. It'd been mentioned briefly in the previous books, and I was always really excited for it because I knew it'd be interesting to read about, and Richelle Mead did not let me down with it. I loved how the new development affected her field experience test. It would have been boring and easy other wise, but Richelle Mead really knows how to shake things up.<br /><br />Oh, and the tension and escalation of things between Dimitri and Rose! I won't spoil anything, but I loved how things went with them and the discussions they had and the resolutions they made. It made me so happy and it was just so perfect.<br /><br />And then, you know, the build up to the main event stopped being build up and really happened and WHAAAT. Blew my mind. And broke my heart. So heart broken.<br /><br />After finishing Shadow Kiss, I bought Blood Promise, Spirit Bound, and Last Sacrifice right way. No more ridiculous \\"I should really read something else during winter break\\" - I had to read them all right away.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm a 27 year old mother of an almost 3 year old, and I've never been very athletic or muscular, and before I got this DVD, I was TRYING to go to the gym 3 days a week at the minimum. That was getting old and boring very fast. Also, I would spend an hour and half or longer there, and dreaded going. I read all the reviews about this DVD because I was totally skeptical, and I am so glad I bought it! I now love getting up at 6 AM to do the workouts! Level One was pretty easy, and I say 'easy' b/c I was expecting her to kill me. I haven't done the second level yet, which I'm sure she will kick my ass since I sound so cocky saying level one was easy, but it isn't! It just didn't leave me feeling like my personal trainer did after he showed me circuit training (which was wanting to puke and crap my pants at the same time) and yet, I know I'm still getting a good work out. 20 minutes is EASY to do everyday, and I look forward to doing this DVD, which is strange for me, because I literally HATE/LOATHE/DESPISE working out. So, my opinion, buy this DVD. I'm going to research more of her DVD's, but this is a good starting point. I don't see myself getting bored with this anytime soon because its only 20 minutes long, and as annoying as she can be, she knows her stuff. Being pretty young still, the jumping jacks and other moves that most people find hard on their knees don't bother me, but I have pretty healthy knees. She does kill my shoulders and legs though, but that is a good thing. Buy this DVD! Its so simple! I can't wait to see if there is a difference in 30 days, I'm only on day 9 but I can already see my arms looking more muscular, and I'm a soft bodied lady.
B003DZX44I|5.0|This is in my opinion the BEST of the classic Disney animated films.  Great music, and the digital restoration that has been done to enhance this edition is fantastic.  The best looking movies in High-Definition Blu-ray are animated films and CG.  This is no different.  This edition is packed with great special features, wonderful menus and like any disney film a slew of previews.  I love the extended scenes as well (includes an entire song that was omitted from the original theater version!)  Sounds great in 7.1 and looks fantastic!
B00371QQ8Y|5.0|I was initially concerned when I got the disc as I figure both versions would be single layer  This is not true, both the DVD and Blu-Ray are double layer, so in essence the disc has 4 layers.  I can't find really any reason to complain about getting a double sided disc instead of 2 singe sided discs.    The quality is fine.  The movie is noticeably grainier than a lot of other movies, but I think this was intentional for cinematic effect and is part of the movie.  You can tell as parts of it are grainier, and harsher in appearance.  Like for instance most of the Tijuana scenes are quite rough.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I'll say this right off the bat; this a tough workout. It is NOT easy. But as Jillian says, if you're dilligent with the workout and push yourself, your body will change in no time. When I started, level 1 was a challenge, and in only a few weeks I can now do level 3. I don't do the workouts everyday, and I actually switch between the levels for lighter or harder eercises. If you get really good at level 1, but want to keep doing it, just use heavier weights. I went from 3 lb. to 4 lb. weights, and it made a huge difference. Now I get the variety of all 3 workouts, and get to keep the intensity as well. It really is tough, but you can always modify it if you need to. Jillian is incredibly motivating, and makes me want to push my hardest. I would recommend this DVD to anyone who wants to lose weight, get in shape, or just feel better about their body.

0307463745|5.0|My five star rating does not mean this book is perfect. It is not at all in my opinion.  However, it is highly worth reading.  I have read many books with contents that are hard to dispute, but they offer little value because I learned little from them. This book, which one can finish reading in a few hours, tells many simple truths that are hard to find in other books.     It should be pointed out that authors started and are running a software company successfully.  I cannot judge how useful or relevant it is for other industry such as manufacturing, farming, etc. If you are in the software business and in favor of agile development and lean startup, most likely you will enjoy reading this book.     I believe this book is essentially about common sense. The book tends to make very strong points about certain forms so there is the risk of ignoring the fundamental reason behind the points. I agree largely with most points they make but almost always with a little bit reservation.     Let me explain with the following three points:  1. \\"Meetings are toxic\\".  If one calculates the cost of every meeting (time x number of attendees x average compensation) and the outcome, most meetings are not worthwhile. However, there are some meetings, especially small group meetings offering the opportunity to bounce and challenge ideas, stimulating intellectual sparks that cannot be replaced with other work form.  This kind of meeting can help produce and valid exceptionally good ideas and filter out poor ones that might lead to disastrous mistakes.  2. \\"Say no by default\\".  The conventional wisdom is that the customer is god and vendors should always heed his words. It is refreshing to hear the simple truth that not every customer's suggestion is worth adoption.  I think the default response should neither \\"yes\\" nor \\"no\\".  Every idea should be looked seriously and objectively.  3. \\"Workaholism\\".  It is a good point that what matters is the outcome, not the process.  They authors equate long working hours to inefficiency.  There are plenty of lazybones who work short hours and are utterly inefficient. There are also plenty of people who are workaholic and efficient hence extremely productive.  I think the valid point here is that one needs to check frequently whether spending more time continuing the path is optimal. The correlation between the efficiency and the number of working hours per day is at best weak if there is any.    The book does not provide stunning discoveries of business. It instead offers observations, perspectives backed by the authors' success. They have probably been felt by many people but never or rarely been written in books.

B004APVI1G|5.0|Allright so everyone is going nuts over how Avatar 3D is a Panasonic exclusive for at-least one year. Let me assure you there are better movies then Avatar for showing off 3D... especially since the current 3D Avatar film doesn't have ANY extras or the extended cut. Beautiful animation and stunning scenery with perfect 3D effects. Showed this film to two friends (both males in late 20s) and both were blown away from the 3D version. I offered to show them Avatar after this and they were more interested in seeing THIS movie again. I know technically it is a kid's movie, but it is an amazing work of art visually in and of itself featuring a story line that doesn't offend adult concepts of character development and story.

B003UESJH4|3.0|Based on the story of King George VI trying to overcome a stutter in time to motivate Britain during the brink of World War II, The King's Speech gives us big-name Brits like Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush (okay, he's Australian, but it still counts), and Helena Bonham Carter to tell us this motivational tale of a man who would be king. This movie is neck-in-neck with The Social Network in the Best Picture race, but is it the best movie? No. Is it a bad movie? Not even. This movie was what you would expect from an inspirational movie and then some, but it seems too much like another inspirational movie called The Blind Side. You had someone come out of nowhere do something considerably crazy to a somewhat lost cause that, in the end, makes him come out stronger than ever.    Colin Firth plays Albert, the Duke of York, who has to make public speeches but has a bad stutter and is thus afraid to talk. His wife, Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter), consults a speech therapist named Lionel Logue (Geoffrey Rush) who is known for his unorthodox yet effective methods of therapy in Australia and also enjoys acting Shakespeare without any success. The resulting buildup and partnership leads to a friendship that becomes just as strong as the future king's ability to speak becomes in the end.    Firth is getting a reputation for this role as he has won the \\"Best Actor\\" from almost every single critic's circle out there as well as the Golden Globe for this role, partially because he can actually make a convincing stutter. He really made his character seem natural and believable, which is hard for a character like his. Helena Bonham Carter's performance didn't leave much of an impression because she always seems to have a very still, calculating face with little emotion that only comes out through her voice. The role that stood out the most, however, was Geoffrey Rush. He made just about every scene that he was in with Firth entertaining, interesting, and at times really funny. His performance probably deserves the Best Supporting Actor Oscar more than Christian Bale, but I haven't seen The Fighter, so I really can't tell.    The movie does benefit of having a great ensemble, but that was because it benefitted from big-named talents, so that really doesn't reflect much on the director. The inspirational arc that this movie has is similar to, like I said, other movies like The Blind Side and Stand and Deliver. In fact, if you were to pair this movie with Blind Side, you can easily pick out the similarities, especially the final scene. The story itself isn't bad, and it does have the heart needed to make this movie work, even if it does come across a little too much by trying to make the audience root for this guy when the burden comes crashing down on him and putting in some obvious moments like George proclaiming \\"I have a voice\\". My only real big criticism, besides the arc, is on the camerawork of this film. The camera puts the actors on the corner or on the far side of the screen as opposed to the center, which if you're going to put a backdrop or some form of movement that goes with the scene is fine, but there wasn't any, so why not put the characters in the center?    Bottom Line: The King's Speech is good like The Blind Side is good. It does suffer from the inspirational schmaltz at times, but it's pretty good. The acting is great from Firth and Rush, it does build up in an entertaining and even funny way, and it does have heart. I wouldn't call this the potential \\"Best Picture\\" as it didn't amaze me like The Social Network did; but nevertheless, it's one of the best and still worth checking out.
0802473156|5.0|This is an excellent book. I believe everyone should read it, it doesnt matter if you are in a relationship or not.
0553573403|2.0|Premise:<br />George R. R. Martin's \\"Song of Fire and Ice\\" series was a fresh start after I had to finished the most-current Robert Jordan book (many books ago now). Like many (many) others, I picked up the book. The length didn't scare me, especially coming off the back nine of Robert Jordan's epic, so I felt a treat was awaiting me. This treat quickly turned sour, and no sooner than the first quarter of the book.<br /><br />Prologue:<br />I don't want to start by tearing the book into pieces at first because I think something should be said: many reviews have mentioned that the \\"writing was excellent\\", yet they state examples of how they hate the writing; and I don't want to fall into that trap. The \\"writing\\" isn't what is good here. What Mr. Martin has done for us is take a simple twist on telling his epic. Instead of blundering through plot-by-plot steps, even disconnected plots at times, he does so through the eyes of \\"Point-of-View\\" characters. On top of this, his finesse in creating believable dialogue is wondrous. These are merits, and worthy of recognition. Bravo, Mr. Martin. I do applaud your brilliance in that arena. However, it is in the other aspects of \\"writing\\" that you have failed, and sadly, in a *very* important aspect.<br /><br />The Torn Pieces:<br />A Game Of Thrones started out with amazing potential. The \\"Others\\" were a great concept that Martin invented to enthrall our imaginations, like fantasy novels do, but what he fails to make them a \\"clan\\" of importance. Once we get a taste of them, we never see from them again. In addition, we are introduced to a sudden political sub-plot, as it were to be. Ah, but there lies the problem... We aren't in a sub-plot, we have been introduced the *real* plot instead. I won't throw the book down yet because I have not read enough to really know exactly what is going on, especially as the characters are only slowly developing, but I can see quickly that the \\"fear\\" of the Others is less of a concern to anyone who was in the novel.<br /><br />After trying to endlessly battle whether the Others were a \\"hidden\\" threat in hope of a grandiose and epic ending to the first novel, I instead keep going deeper and deeper into a story about bastard children that has little to do with anything at all. After nearly 300 pages of reading, we learn that no one is pure. Everyone, even the purest, are doused in unholy thoughts and illegal behavior. Morals and ethics have no place in this novel, and it immediately made me think otherwise about finishing it. But again, I felt I should continue believing things where only building (as most good books do build many different plots and oddities together into a perplexing climax). I was still stumped, another few hundred pages down the rabbit hole...<br /><br />One day I picked up the book to see that I was more than half way done, but I could not remember any memorable parts that could be identifiable as \\"sections\\" or closed plot section. All the links from the plot are muddled into an ambiguous political drama where each character plays out the hero, villain, and idiot. A soap opera, if you didn't know what that was. To make matters worse, the characters I pegged as heroes from the start of the book were all killed off. Now, I have no problems killing characters (and a good author does so in a way to build others characters, or strike a good turning point in the story), but Martin literally just decides to go \\"Um, you die now\\" out of thin air. He waves his magical hand over the paper, and suddenly 10 chapters of the book have become pointless jibberish of character development that really never mattered at all. This is probably one of the largest portions of his \\"writing\\" that he failed to learn about: You don't invest so much time and real estate (portion size based on novel size) building a character that is to be killed quickly. A good debater would argue that Martin wanted to make even his smaller characters have depth, but I would stillargue that less focus and smaller amount of space would have simply done the job.<br /><br />I continue on the rant about characters because it is vitally important. Here though, I want to address to the characters themselves. And again, I want to make a premising statement: Martin has done no \\"copy cat\\" of his characters. If the man were to sit down and create blank characters from scratch to write a politics-driven story from, I would imagine that *every* character would have been seem at least once before from *any* preceding work even remotely based on the subject matter. It's not impossible to create new and interesting characters, but to imagine that every author is going to have that amazing imagination, then I fear we will all be waiting for the second coming of Jesus. With that said, Martin does fail again at even attempting to make the reader guess as something called \\"motive\\". Every person in real life has a motive, and in general, they are never the same as someone else. Even those who seem almost identical may in fact be trying to accomplish the same task for two completely different reasons. Martin does not begin to let us think that's the case. Each of his characters was early-on identified as a Hero or a Villain. And in no particular way did he try to disguise the situation. It's not unheard of to know the heroes and villains beforehand in a politically-driven plot, as the mystery to learn the truth is a driving point, but again, Martin fails to do so by giving it away in the first quarter of the book. He hands you the villains, then shows you the mystery, and flashes it all away into a mindless jumble of awkwardness for another couple hundred pages of idiocracy.<br /><br />I've spoken of the mis-plot that Martin plots, then I spoke of the wasted space used to develop dead characters, and then I spoke of removing the mystery from the plot. What else can I say about this book? Lots.<br /><br />First, let's not forget that another sub-plot (or is it the main plot in disguise?) is revolving around a group of people who fear ships living an ocean away who want to eventually be led by an unwise and stupid leader striking out solely with revenge. Although pundits will chime in to say \\"Martin has three distinct plots to eventually diverge together, so it's not a subplot, it's part of the main plot\\"... guess what, it's not. *Spoiler alert* Four books later, and it's not happened yet.*End Alert* I hate to go on with this one because it almost speaks for itself. Same as half the characters he created for the story. I've given Martin the benefit-of-the-doubt that he wanted to create unique characters, but he didn't try to make unique enough. It was no stretch of the imagination that every character did what I was expecting them to do, simply because it was obvious in their actions/dialogue. With all of the amazingly wasted character depth created for dead characters, Martin could have filled his novel with more dynamic situations and characters who he planned to evolve over the course of the series.<br /><br />Second, where's the magic and fantasy that this novel's culture takes claim too? We are merely teased with \\"dragons\\" and brief mentions of \\"magic\\", but Martin does not deliver. Not once (until later novels) do Dragons even enter the world. In addition, the minor \\"magical tricks\\" that are employed are mind-numbingly stupid. The time it takes to wait on any real fantasy to happen, I'd be an old man dead and long gone.<br /><br />In conclusion, since you have potentially forgotten many things here: Martin has the potential to be a grand writer. His dialogue and creative intent at skipping the traditional way to tell a story lend to an amazing basis of a writer, but he has to learn how to develop characters in a way that the reader is not being told what he/she is/are doing, but learns it from their interactions with the other characters; and in the same vein, to not develop characters that will be suddenly killed. Also, a dose of uniqueness to brighten up the carbon-copy characters that Martin may-or-may-not-have stolen, but created for his world, would help readers identify them to his story rather than constantly asking the question \\"Where do I remember this person from?\\"fear ships living an ocean away who want to eventually be led by an unwise and stupid leader striking out solely with revenge.

1599219751|1.0|As an adventure fantasy or a book for \\"young readers\\" on the model of Gary Paulsen's Hatchet series, \\"The Long Walk\\" might glean three or four stars. But it can't be treated honorably. It's a hoax, a silly fabricated packs of lies, ghost-written by an Englishman. It has been amply exposed by the BBC: \\"In 2006, BBC released a report based on former Soviet records, including statements allegedly written by Rawicz himself, showing that Rawicz had been released as part of the 1942 general amnesty of Poles in the USSR and subsequently transported across the Caspian Sea to a refugee camp in Iran and that his escape to India never occurred.\\"<br /><br />I happened to watch the film first, not knowing what I'd be getting into. I've reviewed the film, as a tolerable entertainment and NOT as a true story. The book infuriates me more, since both the putative escaper Rawicz and his English ghost-writer KNEW they were cheating the truth. I picked the book up at a used book store and read about half of it before I tossed it aside. I've done a lot of long-distance trekking, in North America, in Chile, in Nepal and Bhutan, and in Burma. I wouldn't need the BBC or any other documentation to tell you that this book is pure nonsense. If you want to read a real 'long walk' adventure tale, look for the writings of the Spanish conquistador Cabeza de Vaca or of the great American explorer-geologist Clarence King. Better writing, and TRUE!<br /><br />But the acclaim for this book and the film based on it isn't about truth. It's about Cold War politics.... or so it seems to me, after reading the five-star reviews of both here on amazon. No person of decency and/or intelligence can possibly deny the horrors of the Russian Communist gulags or their Czarist precedents. But read Alexander Solzhenitzyn and skip this blatant commercial swindle!
B001E45XT4|4.0|These are amazing for the price, but seeing as how they dont have a power supply they arent as powerful as the turtle beaches or more expensive headsets.  Still amazing...Recommended to ANYONE on a budget or not BUY THEM if you need something for gaming, listening to music, movies and so on...I will edit this if I run into a problem with them FYI.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|The movie was great and the casting was superb!  Carol Burnett was brilliant as Ms. Hannigan and Aileen Quinn was a perfect Annie.  My daughter (age 8) loved it.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|I don't put much stock in Hollywood rubbish. I don't care if a film wins awards or not. That being said, I love this film. It's such a beautiful portrayal of greed and hopelessness. I didn't find it boring like some reviews have said. There are enough subtleties and plot intricacies too keep you interested and invested in the characters. Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul Dano are fantastic in that you forget they're just actors on a screen, which is increasingly difficult to do in this celebrity-driven culture of ours. So, that's my two cents. Just watch it and make your own decision.
091581112X|5.0|I was looking for books about spiritual growth in Borders, but couldn't find what I needed until I found this book by chance.  I was immediately drawn in, and had to own it.  It is absolutely amazing, unbiased, and just a book about selflessness, and love.  It is so comforting to read, and very powerful.  I recommend it to all who are heading down the path to enlightenment!
B0041VXGRS|5.0|I bought this book to support Bakerella, as she puts out so much \\"FREE\\" information on the internet she deserves some compensation for all her time and effort she gives to everyone.  There are some tips in this book that are not on her website, I would suggest to anyone, buy the book and enjoy it.  Pass it on to someone if you don't need it.    I love her little cake pops, but only make the balls in the candy mold and make them like little cupcakes.  Keep up the great work Bakerella!
0553381687|5.0|I seriously can't recommend this book (and the whole series) enough.  As a pretty big fan of sci-fi/fantasy books, this one pretty much takes the cake, BUT not as a fantasy book!  That's kinda the weird thing about this series; it's not so much fantasy as it is intrigue and drama, sprinkled with some fantasy elements.<br /><br />The characters are beautifully written, loaded with some of the wittiest and intelligent dialogue I have read.  The characters are all unique in their own way.  Some you hate, some you love, and some you hate then love.  But you can't just stop at the first book, because they all leave off on cliff hangers!<br /><br />Beware though, for those easily turned off by vulgarity, there are some parts that are graphic.  Personally, I think it adds a lot more flavor to the book and makes for some really interesting parts, but some people may think its gratuitous (I disagree).
B002S8AGZG|4.0|This movie is definitely one of my high school years.  Though living a school time far different from these characters, this is a movie that brings back all sorts of memories.<br /><br />The nice thing is the movie remains just as good as it did.  It's a staple of that late turn-of-the-millenium era, and anyone my age will happily quote lines from it.  So thankful it came to Blu-Ray.<br /><br />An updated allusion to Shakespeare's \\"The Taming of the Shrew\\" this is full of dilariously witty high school dialogue and banter sprinkled with Shakespearean quotes.  The result is a surprisingly intelligent story of the relationship between sisters, friends, and lovers.<br /><br />The characters are lovable and hilarious, all working with plenty of energy.  The soundtrack rocks.  And it's another example of how timeless Shakespeare can be.<br /><br />However, I was a little bit disappointed with the Blu-Ray.  It has a commentary track, plus a discussion on the movie.  Nice, but a bit lacking for what I have come to expect from bonus features.<br /><br />Even so, it's worth it to be able to get this kiler movie again.
B002ZIAC26|5.0|Timeless and very new.  Brings out feeling of nostalgia and grasp for the future. Feels like this music was heard before, and yet it wasn't.  It extracts an internal element from beneath the subconscious and projects elements of ones existence into a spiritual level just beneath the the conscious.  A joyous, mellow, sane and completely natural hallucination.
B001WCBPCW|5.0|Best album I have heard in a long long time. Every song is great, except for one or two. Imagine if the Beatles stayed together and never aged - this is the album they might come out with in our modern times.
B004DK49DW|4.0|This is one of those albums that grows on you.  My first impression was that it is pretty mellow compared to their earlier music.  The more I listened to it, however, I realized that Social D still rocks.  This was reinforced when I saw them live and could feel the energy of the new music compared to the old.    What I mistakenly associated with \\"mellow\\" was actually \\"polish.\\"  The songs in this album are more polished and produced than their earlier work but I guess this is to be expected.  This is the natural progression of a band that survives 30 years.      My only criticism of the albumn is the lyrics.  For the most part, they are pretty weak.  In fact, one of my favorite songs is \\"Road Zombie\\" which is an instrumental. Of the remaining songs, there is:    * Diamond in the Rough  * Writing on the Wall  * Can't take it with you     All of which can be quoted from virtually any book of clichés.  I would say that others like Machine Gun Blues and Far Side of Nowhere, are also the essance of clichés with little depth.  At the same time, most of us don't have any idea of the lyrics of the songs we love so who cares.  Also, I was not too bothered with \\"Ball and Chain\\" which is about as much of a cliché as you can get (and one of my favorite Social D songs).  I guess I should get over it.    In conclusion, it is a great collection of songs on par with any of their previous work.  In fact, this is arguably their best work.
B00111YM5G|4.0|Gabriel is an awesome, action, gritty, entertaining film as long as you can get past the negative aspects. For starters be prepared to watch some bad acting, actually pretty horrible acting from the actors playing characters Amytiel and Sammael. Gabriel is of course Andy Whitfield is pure amazement to watch (Spartacus: Blood and Sand) The graphics are of low quality as well. The introductory scene of the film contains the best visual effects you will  see throughout the entire film. The soundtrack goes along with the film, the best part of this movie (besides Andy Whitfield) is the plot/ script. Pure brilliance, its basically set in Purgatory and Angels vs Fallen Angels has been going on for quite some time each side sending one warrior every so often who takes human form. The Fallen are winning and the Angels last hope is Gabriel. Since the Fallen feed off emotions it is easy to see why they are defeating the Angels who have never experienced emotions. There is action, romance, and an enjoyable climatic ending to the film. I just wish the Australian team that put this film together could have gained slightly more funding to produce this film. That is the only element that it is lacking. Rent it first but for me it is a must own.
0670022411|2.0|Perhaps my expectations were raised too high by the academic credentials of the author, not to mention the interesting links she kindly included on this site. But now, after far too many hours wading through clanger after clanger, I find I cannot recommend this book. And I am surprised: Knowing how carefully academics parse their words and sentences, I wonder why this author took such liberties with her fiction. To begin with, she hasn't practised the basic rule of \\"show, don't tell.\\" Consequently, we get conversations filled with unconvincing adverbs, situations with no dramatic tension, scenes with no consistency of mood or direction. And what of the characters? These academics express themselves in dialogue that could have been lifted from a sanitized romance novel for thirteen-year-old girls. The main character, Diana, was utterly unconvincing; I believed her long hours in the library and her need to exercise, and absolutely nothing else. Matthew's character was similarly unbelievable: Who drives off to Scotland, to a remote but beautiful lodge (of course) and confesses his cravings to a loyal and brilliant friend (who would have been Chancellor of the Exchequer if he hadn't been a daemon)? Not any guy I know.  Beyond all that, there is no literary style here to make even descriptive passages enjoyable. It remains a collection of elements that never coalesce. The author should have chosen to reach for a higher level of prose, rather than insult her readers with shortcuts and cliches, particularly when the shortcuts litter a long, long, meandering book.
B0036OS3KG|3.0|I really haven't had a chance to wear these outside yet.  The weather got good and I had no need to wear them yet.  But just wearing them around the house I found that I needed an insert to keep my heel from slipping.  I ordered a size 10 because they don't come in half sizes and I needed 9.5.
B004BSIJ9Q|3.0|I loved College Dropout and Late Registration, listened to those two albums over and over.  This album just left me unimpressed, partially because of the praise that has been heaped upon it.  I liked Blame Game, Monster, Devil In A New Dress, and POWER but the other tracks are unmemorable.  Kanye has nothing interesting to say in his lyrics; just the same cliched themes of women, money, and fame in every song.  I also wasn't drawn to the beats of the tracks.  The whole album sounds like any other overproduced, dull top 20 hit on the radio these days.  The reviews I read about this album made it sound like it was breaking new ground lyrically and musically but that couldn't be further from the truth.
B00005JL7Q|3.0|I usually refrain from comparing movies and/or television shows to the books that they are based on. I make an exception when it becomes clear that the producers and/or director are deviating from the story not for artistic purposes or for purposes of condensing a work to fit into about 2 hours (give or take). This is one such exception. Almost every deviation from the book is a cheap attempt to dumb down the story and to pander to more contemporary audiences (the book is set in the mid-90s...which may as well be the dark ages, as far as these folks are concerned).      This is the story of a young man who, after a series of foibles, ends up spending time with an adolescent boy and they both end up changing each others lives in unexpected ways.    Marcus (the boy) is meant to be depicted as utterly clueless when it comes to contemporary pop culture and trends. In the book, Hornby uses Marcus's lack of awareness of Nirvana and Kurt Cobain as a key point to establish this fact. In the movie, the makers decided to update Kurt Cobain with some random hip-hip artist to change with the times. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a big issue but for the fact that Cobain killed himself, sparked a general feeling of malaise and despair among his largely teenage audience, and then set into motion the events that build up to the conclusion of the story. When you take away Cobain, you need to rewrite the penultimate act of the story...and the writers of this film did...just not in a way that felt organic.    The end result (of this and other changes) is that the story suffers, the depiction of Marcus suffers, and a great book turns into an enjoyable, but average, film.    Bottom line: Decent and fun movie, Hugh Grant is well cast, but a pale imitation of the original story.

B0007MWZEK|5.0|Love the swivel sweeper. Picks up crumbs quickly and easily. Have found it is best to pick up long threads from floors before using as they wind themselves around brushes and you will need to remove periodically, but overall, is the handiest and easiest sweeper I have owned.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|Searing, passionate bluesrock from one of the most under-rated and basically unknown guitarists to ever come on to the music scene. Page-Clapton-Beck-Anderson all wrapped up in one package! A quality sonic masterpiece. It won't be long before Bonamassa is \\"discovered\\" by true blues-rock lovers worldwide. How refreshing! Go Joe!
B001EOOQF6|4.0|I'm not sure why everyone thinks Heaven & Hell is a superior album. I prefer Mob Rules mainly because its heavier and drummer Vinny Appice seems to have a bit more energy than Bill Ward's work on the previous album.
B000002KKS|3.0|Don't get me wrong, Heaven & Hell is good but I don't think it comes close to Ozzy's best work or even their next release -- The Mob Rules. On this one, Dio's lyrics are a bit cheesy and the music isn't heavy enough. While \\"Neon Night's is solid, songs like 'Wishing Well' fit the pop metal genre. Maybe I'd like the album more if the band had changed their name after Ozzy left.  I have a hard time listening to it without thinking of better Sabbath work like Sabotage and Paranoid.
1400079144|2.0|Dan Brown has returned to his old form. This is a too long novel that tries too hard to show off Brown's knowledge of symbolism. To Brown everything is a symbol with a pattern. His tired and true hero Robert Langdon uses his eidetic memory to solve seemingly impenetrable puzzles. The action is so fast and furious that it soon becomes mind-numbing. The major problem with the book is the villain. I am so tired of superhuman comic book villains that I stopped reading James Patterson long ago. The comic book villain here is totally unbelievable and that this creature would somehow pass muster to be initiated into the masons is laughable. Instead of ending the novel when the long hoped for demise of the villain occurs, Brown then wastes the reader's time spending an additional fifty pages or so doing religious mumbo-jumbo that is straight out of scientology. I throw few books away but this one went in the trash.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|The box set is terrific! It's available for a great price; if anything, it's underpriced. The Beatles are one of those rare bands where almost every one of their songs are wonderful. The remastering really makes a difference, especially on the earlier Beatles albums. When I put on Help!, I was blown away by how crystal clear it sounded. Definitely one if the best purchases I've ever made.
B0007D0AZU|4.0|Betty Davis is unique. She is extremely talented using raw emotions and heavy beats to make her points. This music is best taken only sparingly and then in small amounts. Nevertheless, there is something hypnotic about it that keeps drawing you back in. However, under no circumstances would I want her as my woman.
B003XCVQ3C|5.0|After trying a few different adapters with little to no success, I ordered the moshi MiniDisplay Port to HDMI Adapter with Audio.  I was seriously impressed with the quality of the product right out of the box.  It looks and feels as if it was built by Apple - the quality is that good.  And the performance matches the quality.  The picture on my 50\\" Samsung Plasma TV is perfect - and my MacBook pro detected the television and automatically scaled the output to 1080P.  The audio is also great - it sounds perfect.  I almost gave up on a HDMI solution for my mid-2010 15\\" MacBook Pro but I didn't - and I am glad.  This product looks and works perfectly.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Not wanting to write a spoiler, I'll just note the conversation this film provoked when I saw it with a friend:    \\"So, why doesn't she pull a Glock out of that bag and turn him into Swiss cheese?\\"  \\"Metal detector.\\"  \\"So, why doesn't she whip out a ceramic knife and stab him in the heart?\\"    And, I wanted her to stab him in the heart so badly I could visualize it.
B00454U1O2|4.0|This is a good compilation CD for PINK. The first CD I received was scratched, but Amazon sent out another one immediately. I love her new works on it, \\"F--- perfect\\" and \\"Raise Your Glass\\". The only thing that I didn't like about the CD is that it's labeled 'Clean' and it's not something I would let my little sister hear: the only curse words that are missing are F*** and S***. Everything else is definitely still on there.  The CD is fun, has a great variety of music on it, and is great to sing along to in the car by yourself.
B000002UA2|5.0|This has always been one of my favorite Floyd albums.  A nice chilled-out album that fits perfectly between Meddle and Dark Side.    It's certainly more basic than their various conceptual 1970s albums, but that is not a bad thing.  I believe they spent just a few weeks recording and mixing it.  It's nice to hear a stripped down Floyd that is not too experimental or over-produced.    I like all of the songs on here, but the standouts are:  \\"Obscured By Clouds\\" (good opening instrumental); \\"The Gold It's in the...\\"; \\"Wot's...Uh the Deal\\"; \\"Mudmen\\" (an instrumental that shows off early evidence of Gilmour's trademark guitar); \\"Free Four\\" (in terms of style this is a throwback to their debut album); the groovy \\"Childhood's End\\"; and \\"Stay\\".  The closing track \\"Absolutely Curtains\\" is a semi-psychedelic instrumental number.    \\"Wot's...uh the Deal\\" and \\"Childhood's End\\" are probably my favorite overall tracks on this album.    Definitely recommended for fans of Floyd and for fans of mellower rock music...
B004132HZS|5.0|I bought this DVD because I had heard about the series through friends and wanted to see it for myself. I was wonderfully surprised. Not only is the acting fantastic, the scripts are nearly flawless and all three episodes are extremely compelling.     At first, I was a little wary of the update of the Sherlock Holmes stories to modern times, but the series is very matter-of-fact and avoids kitsch and cliches. By the end of the first episode, I couldn't believe no one had thought of updating the Sherlock Holmes stories before.     Amazon shipped my order over a week earlier than expected, so I had a great surprise waiting for me at home. I am very much looking forward to series 2 and will definitely continue to look for more shows similar to this in future.
B0001RVTXO|5.0|Basically it's every song you want to hear from the Pixies.  Great album.    The songs don't flow from one to the next as well as they did on the original albums but for all you favorites on one CD you can't beat it.
B003EY7IRC|1.0|I loved her Highlander series and I would recommend them to anyone.  I however hated her new Fever series.  I kept reading them, thinking that she would come around and that it would be good.  It wasn't. I like the new world she has created with the fae living with us. But I agree with an earlier review, this should not have been a 5 book series. Less than a year takes place in the whole 5 book series.  Moning goes on and on and on about unimportant things.     Spoiler Alert! I need to rant for a minute.  Things that I found very upsetting: 1) We never find out what Barrons is 2) Every time we think we've figured out what going on something else happens and its a 180 and we know nothing 3) Mac and Barrons romance might be on then its off then its back on again 4) The Keltars have only a very small part in this book and then she doesn't explain anything about them 5) NOTHING is completed in the end: the queen is still gone, the walls and still down, dark fae everywhere, the book is still out there kind of, and the book ends with them having a cookout!!! Ohhhhh! I'm still mad at that ending.    If you are determined to read this series then go ahead.  But I would tell you to read the first 4 books in the series before you read this one. Otherwise you will not understand a word of this book.
0061726826|4.0|I see this book is being compared to The Hunger Games and I agree as far as it is set in a dystopian society but other than that they are pretty different.  Delirium's world isn't developed as much and it is much less action paced.  I didn't read it with my heart pounding almost unable to put it down.  That being said, it is a good book.  If you want to compare it to anything I would compare it to the movie Equalibrium.  I do feel that the book rambles a bit and I found myself skimming in some areas.  I know some of you will think that that is crazy I am saying the book was too long! But to me it didn't talk about what I wanted to know about such as more information on how this society was formed, the people in power, we met no people in the wilds and just other aspects that I wanted more information on.  In spite of that, this book is a good book.  The idea of love being a disease is fascinating because in a way it is true!  Love can make you do crazy things so I found that to be a very believable aspect of the book.  It is set up for a sequel so if you don't want to read a series, skip this one.  There is almost no cussing and the violence is nothing compared to The Hunger Games.  This does have a romance in it (How could a book about love not!) that I really enjoyed.  It helps you remember what that first love feeling felt like.  SPOILER--My favorite part has to be the ending.  I know, I know, Alex gets captured in the end while Lena gets away.  Its the fact that Alex sacrificed himself so that Lena could get away that I really got me.  That is what love really is.  The ending is what really made the book for me.  If they had both gotten away it would not have been near as satisfying!  What a great set up for book 2.   As a whole this book was very entertaining.  Can't wait for book two.
B0034G4OZO|5.0|After reading some of the other reviews, I understood something fundamental about this flick. If you're looking for a true story about mental hospitals, watch a documentary. There are enough depressing shows out there about mental patients to sate any appetite. And if you can't accept that your kids might not want to be what you want them to be, then you may not like this movie. But if you're looking to be entertained, enlightened and made to just plain feel good about life...well, check this one out. Oh, it's not the best literary film out there, but for a feel good bildungsroman, it's first rate.
B002BNKQDK|4.0|It's very well made, sculpted and all, but it's rather small in my opinion. The name Watchmen on the front it's a sticker, which is not good at all. I bought it during cyberweek, so I paid 14.99. I definitely wouldn't pay 100 bucks for it. As for amazon service, 100 %.
B000FUF6QS|1.0|It should be of great interest to any fan of horror and of British cinema that this wonderful film is available at such a great price. What is frustrating and disappointing, what is more perplexing is the choice of including a half hour featurette on the making of this classic that includes the story of how it was edited for American audiences. It makes no sense to included a video of cast and crew telling you that you are about to watch or have watched the incomplete version of this seminal horror film.      In addition to this strange lack of missing footage in light of a discussion of it is the rather poor quality of the print. It is in mono, and a rather old print, not the original complete one. Depending on who you ask, there is anywhere from 13 to 20 minutes edited out for commercial release in American theaters.     Considering it cult status as one of the brightest and truly original moments in horror film, it is bizarre to see so many fans writing up this DVD transfer with such sparkling praise.     There are longer versions of this great film. Don't waste your money or time on what is an offense to the creators of this great movie. You will be wanting more and asking why you paid for it.
1600595871|2.0|Let me say at the outset that I am a fan of Alisa Golden and I eagerly await all her books.  As said fan, I own all her titles and I was very interested in this book.  I was very disappointed to find out that it is a compilation of her two previous books, Creating Handmade Books and Unique Handmade Books.  Nothing new here.  It is, however, a good value.  It is a good book but don't bother if you already have the others because this is nothing but a retread.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|Han shoots first...Greedo shoots first...SFW!    I hear there is a scene in RotJ that has been left out since its release where Luke creates his own lightsaber on Degobah.  Can't wait to see this highly soughtafter missing scene finally!
B0002X314C|5.0|Cool
6305090564|5.0|This show has it all mean fun, fun fun, action, violence and a gaint flesh eating creature.  I had forgotten how funny this show is!
B001IAOEXU|5.0|The triggers work as intended, I guess. I bought these Dual Triggers to play Dead Space because you need to hold down L2 and use the left analog thumbstick to run, which is awkward and a pain (on my left thumb, literally). The Dual Triggers help quite a bit, but now I understand why people prefer XBOX360 controllers to PS3 ones. In general, I still prefer PS3 controllers as long as I don't have to hold down L2 and use the left analog to run (i.e., holding down X, like in Uncharted, is a better alternative).    (As an aside, why I prefer PS3 controllers: [1] the locations of the analog thumbsticks are more optimal for me and [2] pressing R1 to shoot is better than pressing XBOX360 trigger because the \\"trigger pull\\" is way shorter and you can shoot repeatedly without getting a sore index finger.)
0385732554|5.0|As a book that most students are required to read around the eight grade, I wasn't sure if I would enjoy reading it again as a senior. I was pleasantly surprised to realize that this book has a catching storyline and characters that keep your attention. It is an easy read but also makes you think, which can be difficult to find in most school assigned books. I would recommend this book for free reading, and am glad I was assigned to read it again. Enjoy!
B003TRKQNW|5.0|Cherubini is a much over-looked composer. Few know that it was his Requiem in C minor that was performed at Beethoven's funeral.  Thankfully Riccardo Muti has been steadily recording his works over the last 30 years and EMI have issued this set to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the composer's birth. While I think that the inclusion of texts would have been ideal, or even a weblink, what EMI have done is compile 7 discs in a neat box at just over $3 a disc. Obviously to get this price advantage some compromises must be made, such as the absence of texts.    That being said, the performances are excellent, from solists, choirs and orchestras, and I for one am prepared to accept the absence of a more comprehensive booklet and texts in order to be able to purchase this compilation of wonderful works at such a price, as to buy them individually would be cost prohibitive.    Neville Marriner's contribution of the Overtures is most welcome, as is Callas's aria from Medea to round out the collection.    I recommend you buy this exceptional set and enjoy 'listening', even if you don't understand all of what is being sung. If you are desperate for the texts, a quick whiz around Google should provide you with what you want. Oh, and you don't have to have a religious bone in your body to appreciate and enjoy these works.    A great bargain that hopefully will introduce Cherubini to the wide acclaim he so richly deserves.
B00005N9CV|3.0|I've never listened to Diana Krall before this CD, but purchased The Look of Love along with Girl From the Other Room at the same time, hoping to see two different sides of her style.  I love jazz, orchestra, blues, crooners, etc.  Diana Krall seems to tumble all of these styles together.  Which is great.  But, the issue I have with her CD is that she is singing about love, or the loss of love, but shows no emotion in her songs.  How can you sing a song about having no heart left, yet seem to simply be speaking the words?  The throaty, deep voice that Krall possesses could be stellar in this style of music,  yet she holds back with her vocals and makes beautiful songs into boring phrases.  Plus the cliche wording in some of her lyrics makes me blush with embarrassment on her behalf.<br /><br />I listened to her Girl From the Other Room CD next, and was disappointed again by her lack of emotion.  Her piano is done well,  but I would say it's not even as good as, say, Fiona Apple in creativity and mastery.<br /><br />The background music is likeable.  I enjoy the music, but am not impressed by it.  It is very standard structuring and there's nothing special about it at all.<br /><br />Basically, we've got some decent Starbucks music for this CD.  I was looking for a female jazz/ blues/ crooner to sing along to, but this one's going to be shelved much of the time.
0446195529|3.0|Even after reading the critical reviews I knew I couldn't miss an installment in the Camel Club series.  The book was so slow getting started I felt like I was reading a transcript of a conversation.  The pace blessedly picked up by the end though.  The poor Camel Club members were just thrown into the story for window dressing and should feel cheated. However, if you are a committed Baldacci fan you should probably read this one just so you'll recognize references in future books.
B0001K9IJ8|2.0|Again, Krall has put together a compilation of songs about love and life,  but again does not include the most important factor in music: emotion.  Her voice is much the same as someone speaking the poems with an orchestra in the background.  I know she must have the ability to express emotion with her voice (and it would sound great if she did), but I've yet to hear it.  I have listened to this CD along with \\"The Look of Love\\" and it all is basically coffee shop background music- nothing more.  I'm not impressed by this artist in the slightest and am starting to wish that Limewire was legal so I can avoid wasting my money in the future.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|This movie is so inspirational.  Temple Grandin's story really makes you appreciate the work she has accomplished even with being autistic.  Claire Danes portrayal of her was absolutely amazing!
B001OQCV6A|4.0|At first, I didn't really know if I would like this movie.  Ten minutes later, there was no question that I did!  I love the Matrix-like sequences thought through by Holmes before he would actually do the physical fighting.  The storyline was good and the Holmes and Watson team of Robert Downey, Jr. and Jude Law was great!  I hope soon to maybe see another Sherlock Holmes movie with this combo of director and actors.
B000001Y5X|3.0|First of all im a big fan of Marilyn Mnson . After this album most albums are great, but this one is just too average. It has 2 super songs -> cake and sodomy + lunchbox . All the other songs are terrible i cant hear them. This album is just for strict Marilyn Manson fans and i don't recommend to anyone beyond this. If you are new try Mechanical Animals + Antichrist Superstar
0738212415|5.0|This book is really good for learning the basics to creating realistic drawings! Im using it in an art class for 3-6th graders. I present the short 10 minute lessons at the beginning of class. The students work in their drawing journals. Even my 6 year old is learning the lessons at home! They are short, simple and doable for anyone! I prefer this book over m.kistlers other book called draw squad. Great for both adults and students. After the simple drawing lesson there is even an option to take the lesson to the next step and apply it in some other way to create a piece of art.
0060574216|4.0|This book has many good advices and information about how men and women respond to some circumstances. For example men need some space to relax and think about how to solve a problem while women discuss problems just for relaxing and THEY DONT WANT SOLUTIONS -> they just want to talk. This idea is analyzed very much in point to read the same and same again and again. It has some strange ideas like writing love letters (I'm from Greece and this idea sounds very lame -> i don't know about American guys). Generally i found this book interesting enough and i suggest this book to all men who have relationship problems with women. Very good book
B0041T7FS6|5.0|Finally the 12\\" versions of My Forbidden Lover and Soup for One!!!<br />Love the Norma Jean 12\\"s<br />Dimitri is a great choice of remixer leaving the MUSIC in tact.<br />There are more remixes from Dimitri doin' Chic and Sister Sledge, look for them as mp3's, I could not find them on cd or vinyl.<br />I miss What About Me in the original album version (or could there be another lost 12\\" version?)<br />Nile I Love You!
0618918248|5.0|Great read, really lays out some interesting thought experiments.  Makes a good argument that people's religions AREN'T their own business when they effect everybody thru law and public policy.      HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
0316098337|4.0|I am working my way through the 2010 Man Booker shortlist. This is my fourth - I have read The Finkler Question, In a Strange Room, C, and now Room. I give 2-star ratings to the first three (I haven't got round to writing a review of In a Strange Room yet), but I give a hesitant 4-star to Room - perhaps 3-star would be better. But it's the first of the group to really interest me and make me want to carry on reading. I did not like the narration in 5-year-old style, but the writing is very clever and well sustained - at least for the first half of the book. In the second half I thought that the 5-year-old was far too quick to form opinions of 'Outside' when he had no database of 'Outside' experiences to provide him with a background to enable him to form his very adult judgments. The author credited him with far too rapid an adjustment to this new reality. Also, I don't know how much I can trust the psychiatric development/adjustment of Jack to the 'Room' stage of his existence and then to 'Outside'. Emotionally, I found reading some of it, especially the escape section and the psychiatric clinic, quite distressing. Then the last part did rather peter out.     So far, four novels dealing with more or less dysfunctional individuals and situations. A grim commentary on modern society.
B003OML23K|5.0|Take some time and sit down and just read the entire series.  This book is the first in the series and it had me hooked.  I read it in 2 days.  I'm not one of these people that can stay up until 4am reading but if I was that's what would have happened.  Katnis isn't a typical heroin.  She's a loner and kind of surly, and completely clueless as to how talented and interesting she really is.  Which made me lover her and root for her and suffer with her.  You could stop after this book, but do yourself a favor and keep reading.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|I purchased two of these.  One for my cousin that just moved to Woodstock, IL where this movie is deeply rooted.  I sent it to him so that he could watch it on Groundhog Day!  He didn't own it and I thought that was an utter shame.  I purchased the second one for me since I only owned it on VHS.  It is wonderfully funny and everyone could relate to a horrible day that just doesn't seem to end.  Everyone would definitely love this movie.  Bill Murray is sarcastic and hilarious!  It has great cameos of Chicago comedians and a really good cast of characters.  If you don't own it - buy it.  If you have never seen it, you really should!  You won't regret it, unless you just don't like to laugh.
B004BLTNJI|5.0|Love this movie! Tim Burton can just keep churning out these wonderful stories.  The style is beautiful and the story is fun.  If you love Coraline or Mirror Mask or Stardust go to the book store and look for Neil Gaiman he wrote all the books that inspired those movies.
0810982862|3.0|With great text and some beautiful images, this is a book to everyone ho likes art books of movies. I dont give 5 stars only because I like to see more photos of the production. If this film required a lot of concept artists over 10 years to create this universe, we need to see more of this process...I think they cut all this informations to sell in some different books, so we spend more...or not.
B000VDUWMC|4.0|Diamond creates an amazing analysis to explain how the world's societies are so diverse in wealth, technical advances, and agricultural progress.<br /><br />I found it enlightening that - and reinforced throughout - that if all peoples round the world had access to the same resources, we would all have the same wealth, technology and food.<br /><br />However, we all know better. The world is not that simple. Diamond does an excellent job of peeling away eons of human history to help us understand how Aboriginal and native populations came to be brutally conquered by seemingly unstoppable colonialists.<br /><br />Geology, mother nature, and luck had conspired to place domesticate-able plants and mammals in the right places, namely Eurasia.<br /><br />The only serious problem with the kindle edition is: none of the charts display correctly, rendering them nearly illegible, and none of the images display at all.<br /><br />Hopefully Amazon and the publishers will work to improve these aspects of GGS.
B002JVWR9U|5.0|The Vampire Diaries TV show is very different from The Vampire Diaries books. Aside from the characters names being the same (and even that's not always the case), and the basic premise of the story being the same, the show is nothing like the books.    And in my opinion, that is a very good thing! The books were interesting, some parts very good, but they also got very, very weird. Too weird for me. The show keeps it normal enough, but it's also full of excitement and revelations every week! While there are lots of mysteries in The Vampire Diaries TV show, it's not like other shows where they string you along from week to week, never really telling you anything. In TVD, something new is revealed every week, building up to that ultimate moment to keep you glued to your seat from the very beginning of each episode to the very end.    The Vampire Diaries is a great show, with great writing, great talent...and a super hot cast! Buying the show on DVD is a no-brainer, when you go back and watch the episodes, you notice little clues and nuances that you may not have seen the first time through. It's a great watch MORE than once, buy this show!!
1596912863|4.0|This book was cute and unexpected.  It was a pleasure for anyone who has ever wished they could disappear into their favorite regency/victorian/edwardian novel.  The characters were fun and there were enough twists to make the plot stand out from your typical beach read.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|They remind me of hippies, the way they dress, their exhuberance.  The music is catchy and definitely not mainstream.
B000JQUZCI|5.0|I am an ardent cynic when it comes to \\"classics.\\" I think many people will read a book or hear a song, and if it is old, they will call it a classic. Then this \\"classic,\\" whether it is good or not, must be respected because of its age. I feel this way about the pioneers of Rock, who all made horrible music, but paved the way for good modern Rock and Metal. I feel this way about old movies, which were all terrible, but paved the way for today's movies. And I certainly felt that way about Bram Stoker's Dracula, which was a painfully boring and pointless book. Classics, in my opinion, must stand on their own in modern times. If have to start make excuses for a book, as if it is a senior citizen crapping the bed, it isn't a classic. It's crap. Frankenstein, or The Modern Prometheus, is a book worthy of this label, \\"classic.\\" Before reading further: SPOILER ALERT! There aren't any twists which I'm going to reveal, but SPOILER ALERT nonetheless. The book is told in three tiers. First is present day (for when the book was written) on a vessel in the arctic. A man writes to his sister while on a years-long journey of discovery. He stumbles upon Victor Frankenstein, a gaunt, emaciated and emotionally destroyed man, whose fatigue should have killed him. The second tier is told through Victor Frankenstein's story of his misfortune, beginning with his wonderful childhood, continuing with his creation of the Monster, and ending with his chase of the Monster in the Arctic. Within Frankenstein's story, the third and most revealing tier of the story is laid. Frankenstein's Monster tells of his unfortunate beginnings when he was innocent and harmless inside.<br /><br />The book tells a tale of love, ambition, adventure, obsession. She delves into the nature of humans and why we do good and bad things. Unlike many writers of her time, she does not inject her book with meaningless religious crap, save some understandable references. Where in Bram Stoker's Dracula, prayers may as well have been used in place of punctuation, Mary Shelley uses spirituality and the supernatural not as Deus Ex Machina tools to make her job easier, but as a way to reveal her characters' state of mind. When is a man more desperate than when he starts to believe that his dreams are windows into Heaven where his poor loved ones reside? I cannot recommend this book enough for anyone who wants to try some classics on for size. Out of the classics I've recently read, including War of the Worlds, The Island of Dr. Moreau, Bram Stoker's Dracula, Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde, and Alice in Wonderland, Frankenstein is probably my favorite.n used in place of punctuation, Mary Shelley uses spirituality and the supernatural not as Deus Ex Machina tools to make her job easier, but as a way to reveal her characters' state of mind.

B004GHYCKW|2.0|PJ's rocking days are beginning to feel but a distant memory.  I could forgive that if her new work oozed passion and inspiration like it did not so long ago. Of course, it would help as well if her new songs were listenable, complex, and captured some of the magic that makes so much of her prior work so enduring.      Autoharp strumming, John Parish's backing vocals, PJ's strained \\"Oh, A-mer-i-CAH...oh, Eng..uh..rand\\", frequent repetitiveness, the lack of powerfully competent guitar or percussive work- all end up feeling pretty annoying.  I am intrigued by many of the themes woven through these songs, but the vocal delivery and musical accompaniment detract from rather than enhance those themes.    Seeing her perform these songs live, fully missing the passion she's barely been able to contain when belting out so many of her incredible music in the past actually left me feeling pity,oddly, over the fact that she's going to be touring, performing these same monotonous, predictable numbers, over, and over, and over...    She seems unwilling to challenge herself in a way she has before, and that makes it feel as though she is just going through the motions.    Sasha Frere-Jones characterizes PJ's disappointing \\"evolution\\" in his on-point New Yorker review of this Album: \\"At some point, she stopped singing from her viscera and brazenly swinging her guitar, and turned into a wispy poet with little more than a piano, a falsetto whine, and a story from everywhere and nowhere--mostly the latter.\\"
B000067FP8|5.0|If you liked the first Gremlins movie you can't help but enjoy this sequel. The Gremlins are back and they take over the big city! Trust me no one can NOT love the Gremlins they are completely addictive and even though they are ugly as sin they still have the ability to make you love them! I definitely recommend.
0670022411|4.0|I loved the Twilight series, but wished it had been about adults and had more substance to bite into as opposed to being all about teen angst.  This book is about adults plus lots of interesting history and romance! I love it! I'm not quite done, but I have been spending late nights and all my free time during the day reading it.  I have about 100 pages to read and am going to start slowing down, considering I'll have a long time to wait for the sequels.
0684833395|5.0|In case you didn't know, the word stressed spelled backwards is desserts.  Similarly, the words taco salad spelled backwards is dalas ocat, which to the astute mind, makes absolutely no sense.  We highlight this important point to foreshadow the fact that much of Catch-22 doesn't make any sense either.  That being said, don't think for a second that Joseph Heller's most popular novel isn't one of the funniest ever written.    Who in their right mind doesn't yearn for a little dysfunctional military comedy every once and while?  We do, we do!  You've got to be alert (and slightly insane) to keep pace with Captain John Joseph Yossarian and the rest of his bombardiers.  The reward however, is a hilarious account of military Bureaucracy and a few other things that go well beyond our humble comprehension, but are enjoyable nonetheless.        Catch-22 has climbed to the top of several lists, including The Modern Library, Time, and The Observer.  Furthermore, it came in at a respectable 11th place in the UK's Big Read campaign.  We loved the book for its unique voice and fast pace.  The novel will make you cry, laugh, and then wonder what you were so emotional about in the first place.  No catch, just a good story.
B002ZG994U|4.0|Movie arrived on time.  I like this type of flick.  An excellent cast does the best it can with an average script.  Lot of chases, gun fire, explosions, etc.
0525457585|5.0|What a great movie!  What an even better young adult novel!  You just can't beat a magical story with reader participation.  Seriously, you can't - so don't even try.  Prepare to journey into Fantasia alongside Atreyu and help him save the Childlike Empress and her kingdom from something called the Nothing.  Then prepare to save yourself...  Only those of \\"noble heart and steely sinew\\" dare venture forth.     Unfortunately for us, and probably many of you, we watched The Neverending Story before reading it.  Don't get discouraged though, because the entire second half of the novel is left out of the movie.  Also, the cover art on the 1997 Dutton edition is quite impressive, and even the text itself adds a certain amount of intrigue.  Red and green font is utilized throughout to designate the two storylines taking place in each parallel world.  We enjoyed novel immensely and were even more surprise to see just how similar the movie dialogue was to the book.      Lastly, The Neverending Story will teach you the importance of loving yourself as you are.  Pardon us for channeling Dr. Phil, but it's always a bonus when a novel is able to learn you something.  What a great novel to read with your children and then break out the 1984 film.  It won't be long before they're begging you to go to the pet store and buy a luckdragon!
B003QTDAM2|4.0|The content is good and worth reading but I downloaded the book to an ipad and to my Kindle for PC to see if it was any better. The formatting especially of tables was very haphazard. Invariably when we in Australia pay 2 times sometimes more than the price others pay for northern hemisphere books, I will continue to use my ipad and the kindle versions of books. But relatively speaking, the quality of the read via Kindle was way below the standard expected.  I have found this with other books so not specifically Art of the Start. Sorry it had to be this book that gets my wrath!

1151097764|1.0|I've only read the first 100 pages and the book is excellent.  The publishing of the book is unbeleivably bad, however.  I can't even believe they could sell such a thing.  There are probably 20 types per page.  ItIsVeryCommonForWordsToBeSmashedTogetherlikeThis.  W often appears as \V.  8 1/2 appears as 8V2.  If you appreciate puzzles you may like this version, but if you actually want to know the story as Tom Wolfe intended it, you should skip this version and anything published by General Books LLC.
B004624N6K|5.0|I must admit this CD has it all. If you like more harmony and long melodies this CD is not for you.  It jumps from slow ballads to fast electronic/merengue with the help of El Cata.  Except for the merengues and the Waka Waka remixes, there are no two songs alike. I would like her to release the single Rabiosa with Pitbull which is my favorite. Rabiosa has a norteño mexican feel mixed with merengue....awesome combination.  She should bring this to stage it would be awesome seeing on stage the mix of guitar electronica, mexican norteño, merengue, hip hop with Pitbull all in one song on one stage. Plain and simply this is latin pop with a touch of world music.
0783116934|5.0|Excellent movie...  Stephen Rea and Donald Sutherland are exceptional..  Gives a great experience of cold war Russia, and the most prolific serial killer the world has ever known.
B004E547D8|4.0|Good fun movie.  What I like most about this version, is that it was just the movie.  Didn't have to pay a lot for those extra features that we never watch anyway.
B002ZG99TA|2.0|Typical Tony Scott: empty-headed filmmaking hiding behind a terrific cosmetic surface.  His movies are always shot well, even when they have absolutely no point.  There are about 15 minutes of impressive action intensity, but most everything that occurs hinges on suspense cliche rather than on real suspense.<br /><br />Chris Pine doesn't really do anything new.  Denzel Washington can sleep walk through Plan 9 From Outer Space and remain dignified, so what can I say other than that he at least gets to sit down for most of the movie.  Gorgeous Rosario Dawson is completely unconvincing as an operations chief, or whatever she was supposed to be.  I kept admiring her skin -- that's how uncompelling her performance was.  Bad villain (ooo, wicked corporation guy, how original), and lots of Pictionary scriptwriting.  We keep paying to see junk like this, so Hollywood keep making it.  I spackled nail holes in the living room wall while watching this unoriginal bore.<br /><br />I will give Tony Scott this -- he likes helicopters...and would be incapable of making a movie without them.
030746363X|5.0|I must say, I originally bought this on the Kindle, but after reading most of it in that format, I purchased the hardcover version--easier to jump around, and put post-it flags in sections.  I am in the process of losing weight, and getting rid of insomnia, and I am finding it useful in other ways also.<br /><br />It makes sense, in many ways it is a starting point for individual self-experimentation, and that is what I think people need, because we are all a little different.<br /><br />It would be nice if it came with a set of spreadsheets to help track measurements and different individual hacks, but maybe that will be a future download from his website.<br /><br />All-in-all, thumbs up.
B004DK49DW|5.0|I love this new Social Distortion CD. I received it in great condition and all I can say is that I'm happy with it.Listening to it all the time.
031606792X|5.0|I was too impatient to wait for the final movie, so I read this book the weekend I got it! I think books are almost always better then movies made about them and this is no exception. I will have to get the other books and read them as well!
1579128149|3.0|This book is like having a visual dictionnary of the elements of the periodic table.  It's a beautiful book, but an heavy one.   I'd rahter have a little more informations and academic stuff about each elements but instead there's a lot of every day facts.  To make it short and clear, this book is a good reminder about your periodic table and a good one to give as a gift for a curious kid (12 +)!    The shipping was fast, I received the book in perfect condition (new probably!).
B004927I50|1.0|the cd skipped and there was no bonus video.  I did report this on line before but I did not get an answer.  I always purchased items from amazon; however, after this cd I am afraid to order additional cds.
B004G600A4|5.0|I accompanied my daughter-in-law and granddaughter to the theater.  Otherwise, I would not have gone to see it.  I have never cried at an animated movie, but I cried at this one.  I will buy it when it comes out on DVd, two copies.  One for her and one for me.

1565847032|5.0|Understanding Power by Noam Chomsky is a brilliant book that, through a collection of lectures given by the author in the 1990's, takes a raw look at U.S. foreign policy, American economics, the media and the interests drives our country.     Chomsky proposes an excellent on the analysis the power structure governing our lives and on the importance of the individual to understand and engage with the world. Understanding Power is a very eye-opening book and most importantly, Chomsky encourages people to think for themselves and not to take other people's opinions, including his opinions, as fact.    This book serves as a great introduction to Chomsky's political work and political philosophy. Understanding Power is very readable and very accessibly written and easily digestible. I highly recommend this to anyone with an interest in understanding the power structure governing our lives.
B00454U1NS|4.0|I wasn't a big Pink fan. I knew some of her songs and mainly bought this for my wife who likes her. I was totally blown away by the number of songs I was familiar with just listening to the radio on my way to and from work and at work when I had the chance. Unfortunately many stations don't name the bands when they play a song and you never know who your listening to without doing some investigating on your own. Anyway the thing that surprised me the most was the variety of music she has produced. As I said I had heard many of these songs but would have never guessed they could have all come from the same source. Being in my early 50's I'm not all that in tune to the newer artist. I still live mostly in my beloved 70's music, which I listen to at home, with the occasional new song or artist that catches my ear. Pink has raised my respect for the talent and music she has made. If anybody may be sitting on the fence weather you might like her music or not, I would strongly recommended this CD. Even if you never get another, I can't possibly believe you'd be sorry.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|Though at the BOX OFFICE it did not well this movie is one of those that one has to think in their mind n hears, imagine if they were in a situation like that. Sometimes movies are not all about extravagant special effects, more stars, but the story itself you need to ask your self what is this movie saying and what does it mean. My answer to you is a MUST WATCH and ROCK does an amazing job in the movie. For everyone it might mean nothing or what have you but think is what one needs to do, follow the movie the characters and the storyline to the teeth n you will get your answer.
1400079144|4.0|Another fun read from Dan Brown.  This one ran just a bit long - especially at the end of the novel, but still an enjoyable, entertaining story.

030746363X|4.0|The review is directed more towards the dieting. It's very simple:    1. Avoid White carbs.   2. Eat the same meals over and over again.  3. Don't drink calories.  4. Don't eat fruit.  5. Cheat day one day out of the week. Eat whatever you want.     That alone impressed me, so I am currently doing the diet. I don't know about the other junk in the book and don't really care.  The logic of the diet is reasonable -- especially the requirement of green vegetables and legumes.     After 14 days, I dropped close to 10lbs.  Some of that might have been water, but it still impressive for me (and motivating). Except for the \\"cheat day\\", I don't ingest sugar (that includes sugar from fruit) and I'm noticing other benefits regarding sleep and less headaches.     At six weeks I had lost 20lbs. Bottom line. If you like things simple, hate counting calories and want to see quick results then i recommend the diet. I'm not sure how realistic it is long term, but it's a good way to get started.
B003DZX3US|5.0|Movie came in the shape they said it would, watched it asap and LOVED it! Will not hesitate to purchase other DVDs from this seller!!
0061914177|4.0|I really admire the author, and I found this book to be very motivating.  I did find it to be a little contradictory in places, for instance, it does seem like his basic premise is \\"sheer force of will and hard work,\\" but in fact to scale a business up to be as big as his multiple business interests, he had to rely on systems and delegation to a certain extent, and I wish he had talked about this more.  Social media, networking, and forum activity are awesome, but to scale up to a Gary Vee-size empire, I feel like there is more to the story, and I want to know it!
B003EY7IRC|3.0|I am a huge fan of the entire Fever series. It is suprising, suspensful, smart, and a great all around read. That being said, the last book in the series was a bit of a let down. A lot of the important questions were answered but there was no satisfying conclusion to several of the important story points. Also, the book spent way too much on Mac having long detailed conversations and debates with herself that were pointless. I wish it would have focused on her interactions with other familiar characters more, and spent less time making me feel like I was reading the world's most self involved diary. Over all, it is a must read if you have started the series but not nearly as good as the rest of the books.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|You have to kind of suspend belief at some of the scenes and situations in this action-thriller, but it was really fun to watch. It had a super cast which included Bruce Willis, Mary Louise-Parker, Helen Mirren, John Malkovich and Morgan Freeman who are all retired or semi-retired senior CIA operatives who get brought back into active duty by Bruce Willis he becomes involved with Mary Louise Parker in a long distance over the phone relationship and realizes he has to get to Kansas quickly and rescue her from the likes of Julian McMahon who plays the vice president of the United States, Richard Dreyfuss plays a bad operative who is after them. Brian Cox is great as a suave and smooth Russian counterpart.<br /><br />The story is sort of convoluted and at times a little hard to figure out, but there's lots of actions and some spectacular big-time explosions that make it pretty exciting. Lots of chase scenes, explosions, tongue-in-check jokes, comedy and a good dose of romance thrown in, it's just a lot of fun. If you're a baby boomer, you'll be cheering for all of these characters and having plenty of good laughs along the way.
B001NEK2GE|4.0|The G13 is King!  After reading other reviews I was a little skeptical but I am glad I took a chance.  The G13 is very easy to set up (I'm a Mac user) and makes game play much easier.  I primarily play WoW and it is a lifesaver.  No more hand gymnastics!  Everything you need right at your fingertips and you can still use the keyboard for chatting and less often used commands.  It takes a little time to get adjusted to the G13 but once you do you won't want to go back.  Also the three memory settings work well for players with multiple characters (warrior, caster, healer).  I am very glad that I got one and am surprised they are not more popular.

B003EI2EH2|3.0|This book is, if nothing else, a fun read.  Mr. Ferriss is a good storyteller, and he'll definitely keep you entertained throughout.  Using the advice inside to transform your body, however, is a matter of separating out the valuable information from the outrageous hype.<br /><br />His \\"minimum effective dose\\" theory for exercise is a good example.  He starts out by saying that a single exercise with the kettlebell twice a week is all you need, but then he turns right around and describes an exercise regimen with several other exercises.  He does include the disclaimer that these other exercises aren't \\"necessary\\" but if that's so, why include them?  It reminded me of the old \\"button soup\\" story, where the miser gets tricked into providing all the ingredients for the meal on the promise that just a button and a pot of water could make the best soup he ever tasted.  You add all the extra exercises in, and when you get some positive results... WOW!  That kettlebell is incredible!<br /><br />The diet information is hit-and-miss as well.  Many of his principles are sound, but the way he puts them together leads to a diet that not many people can stick to.  The diet as he presents it is good for a jump start to weight loss, but it isn't a sustainable lifestyle change.  Most people are going to get bored with the same 3-4 meals over and over six days per week.  That's not to say that none of his advice is sound.  Much of it is.  Avoiding \\"white carbs\\" - sugar, flour, rice, etc., is good advice, as is not drinking loads of calories.  Fruit juice is just as sugar-packed as soda, and just as likely to sabotage weight loss.  Finding an eating program that you enjoy and can sustain for the rest of your life is more beneficial in the long run than forcing yourself into a diet to get your weight down.  Ultimately, most people who choose option B are going to end up sinking back into their old eating habits and end up just as big as they were before the \\"diet.\\"<br /><br />There are some helpful tips in the book, but don't expect a miracle.  People have been searching for a magic formula to lose weight and get into shape without diet and exercise for many years, and there simply isn't one.  There is no substitute for a healthy, sustainable diet and regular exercise - not if you want to KEEP yourself in shape.  It's not enough to get there.  The trick is staying there.
B002ZG98Z0|2.0|Boy, I sure wanted to like this movie. I wanted that fun, sassy vibe that Sex and the City is known for. But the first movie wrapped things up so sufficiently that it really didn't leave room for any sequels. The writers did a good job trying to make this thing work, but everything that was cool about the series was actually a turn-off in this movie.
006621131X|5.0|When they had their first joint show, an art critic dubbed it: \\"The Diary of a Friendship\\" and that, too, is what one might call Patti Smith's achingly tender diary of her relationship between her and her beloved friend, Robert Mapplethorpe, Just Kids.    It's a book that almost defies classification: It's not really a memoir/autobiography--it's more an auto-biography. A combination of the one and the other, a bringing together of the two to form one whole, much like the relationship between Smith and Mapplethorpe. You might find yourself wowed by seeing so many of your personal icons walk through the pages, but I'm guessing you will be mostly just deeply touched by the tenderness, the beauty, the youthful desire, mistakes and lucky accidents, love and sadness.    At the core of this book, is the melding together of these two young artists and how they become one and how they became individuals. The most poignant moment of the book for me (other than the end) was when Smith describes the photo shoot for Horses, as she looks at the photo that became her album cover, she encapsulates what seems to be their entire experience together (and brings me to tears in the process):        \\"Whenever I look at it now, I never see me. I see us.\\"     It's a hard book to write about, other than to say the prose is often beautiful, always concise. It's a book, like the words and music and images of the two artists it is about, that I can't imagine not loving.
1596680199|5.0|This is one of my first polymer clay books, along with one of the books from Donna Kato.  I thoroughly enjoy looking through this book for inspiration and ideas.  The pictures are quite vivid too.  I really like that she shows how to make the look of wood and different types of things like Coral, Amber, Turquoise, etc.  Very helpful.  I will definitely buy more of her books.
B003IPC5SO|3.0|I held off on buying this because on initial listen, the lead off single and audio snippets of the entire album did not draw me in. But being a huge fan and not finding any good music to buy out there currently, I caved in. Just so that you know where I'm coming from I found Kylie's \\"X\\" to be not only her crowning achievement but also one of the 10 best albums of the past decade. I thoroughly enjoyed her X tour live in the States a few years back as well. \\"Aphrodite\\" plays like a sequel to that masterpiece or maybe even can be titled \\"X-Lite.\\" But that may be being too generous to this CD. In fact, half the tracks seem like they were rejected cuts for \\"X.\\" As another reviewer astutely pointed out, they are boring and offer very little other than a serviceable dance beat. A DJ can put this on and take an hour break and not worry about a thing because the record will keep the patrons dancing. But as far as killer cuts go there are only about 2 or 3. The first 4 tracks are very good but after that, make sure you listen to the rest of the CD when you are wide awake during the day if you don't want to miss anything. Putting tracks 5-12 on at night would be a surefire cure for insomnia. I have to revise my stance on \\"All The Lovers.\\" 8 months ago I wasn't impressed but now I think it is pure pop perfection. It is one of her best songs in the last 10 years. \\"Closer\\" is also very wicked as is \\"Get Out Of My Way.\\" The album might have worked better with different sequencing and spreading these tracks throughout the CD rather than bunch them up all in the beginning. Because after track 4 there is nothing to look forward to. Still, compared to today's standards this album is not too bad. In my opinion it is better than \\"Body Language\\"(2 stars) by a hair and falls slightly below \\"Light Years\\"(4 stars) and \\"Fever\\"(4 stars). My desert island CD would still be \\"X\\"(5 stars).
0525951652|5.0|This book has already been broken down a thousand different ways by previous reviewers, so I will keep this short.  I loved it.  I loved Pillars of the Earth and World Without End as well. I'm guessing if you loved those, this will instantly be a favorite. I cant wait for the next two books.
B000KX0HVY|5.0|It takes a GIANT of an entertainer to create a two cd set that is filled with all fabulous songs. Elvis Presley stands so distinctively  above all other popular music vocalists that such an all fabulous songs cd set is exactly what you find in The Essential Elvis Presley. If anything, The Essential Elvis Presley is an understatement of Elvis' unmatched and enduring musical legacy. It would have been possible to extend The Essential Elvis Presley to four song-packed cds and these four cds would have still contained all fabulous Elvis' songs. I own and am familiar with about 80 of Elvis' best cds and cd sets, so I know what I'm talking about. Elvis Presley still remains and probably will always be the KING of Rock N Roll, rhythm and blues music, and slower romantic ballads. The Essential Elvis Presley does a very thoughtful job of selecting 40 songs to include in this two cd set. I am especially pleased that the song selection included Fever, Steamroller Blues, Can't Help Falling In Love, Peace In The Valley, Reconsider Baby, and the original, not the remixed version of, A Little Less Conversation. I am disappointed that Any Way You Want Me, One Broken Heart For Sale. and Ask Me were not included. The remastered version of Reconsider Baby emerges on The Essential Elvis Presley as perhaps the best rhythm and blues song that Elvis ever recorded! The song selection also does an excellent job of sampling Elvis' songs across his entire singing career; from the beginning to the end of Elvis' singing career. All of the songs have been remastered so the sound quality of The Essential Elvis Presley is outstanding. It makes perfect sense that anyone who is an ultimate fan of Elvis Presley, as I am, should purchase, or more likely re-purchase, his/her favorite Elvis' music in remastered form, because one can then best hear and appreciate the greatest beauty of Elvis' fabulous music. The Essential Elvis Presley should be a MUST BUY cd for every true fan of Elvis Presley; it has my strongest positive recommendation.    John
0553579908|5.0|The bold omen of a comet \\"the color of blood and flame and sunsets\\" opens \\"A Clash Of Kings\\" the second novel in George R.R. Martin's epic fantasy series \\"A Song Of Ice And Fire.\\" Published by Bantam Books in 1999, \\"A Clash Of Kings\\" is a gripping multi-layered saga filled with characters that are interesting, witty, loathsome, or sympathetic.<br /><br />The title of this fantasy novel is entirely accurate. Following the suspicious death of King Robert Baratheon in the first novel, his Iron Throne that unites the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros is suddenly in dispute. Although Robert has three children and his eldest son, the adolescent and wholly reprehensible Joffrey, has ascended to the throne, the regency of his mother Queen Cersei is perceived as weak. More than one claimant seeks the Iron Throne and many kings clash as peace flees the land and challengers continue to scheme and multiply.<br /><br />The Competing Monarchs<br />Stannis Baratheon: A younger brother of the late King Robert, he declares himself the rightful heir of the kingdom. He dismisses the children of Robert by claiming (correctly) that they are bastards. Cersei conceived all three of the children with her twin brother Jaime Lannister with whom she has had an ongoing incestuous relationship. The allegation is so shocking however that it is not sufficient to topple the regency of Queen Cersei. Additionally, Stannis Baratheon is supported by the sorceress Melisandre who is a priestess of the Lord of Light R'hllor. She is aggressively spreading this religion in the Seven Kingdoms and her power is real. Stannis has attached himself to her power and his quest to take the throne is deadly serious.<br /><br />Renly Baratheon: The younger brother of Stannis Baratheon also seeks the Iron Throne. Although he has no direct claim because of numerous heirs ahead of him, Renly is attractive and well-liked, which is not the case for the dour Stannis. Renly also has many important allies and supporters that make him militarily strong.<br /><br />Robb Stark: The eldest son of Eddard Stark who was executed at the end of the first novel, Robb does not seek the Iron Throne. Instead, as the heir of the northern kingdom that had been united within the Seven Kingdoms, Robb has reverted to an independent state and been crowned the King of the North by his followers. He is young, only fifteen, but battles have made him grow up quickly, and with his pet dire wolf Grey Wind, he strikes a strong pose and has earned the loyalty of his men and knights.<br /><br />As if a kingdom splintering into civil war were not sufficient, the plot of \\"A Clash Of Kings\\" is even thicker than good clam chowder and many more characters and subplots are woven into the story.<br /><br />As in the first novel in the series, the Stark children hold a central role in the story, but now they are separated by multiple conflicts. Although the daughters Arya and Sansa take up a good portion of the novel, their brother Bran and half brother Jon Snow tend to have more interesting storylines. The crippled Bran remains in the Stark ancestral home of Winterfell. Since being pushed out a window by Jaime Lannister, Bran has begun to experience supernatural abilities now that his body is broken. He can join with his pet dire wolf during his dreams, but he is not quite sure what it all means.<br /><br />Then the adventures of the bastard son of Eddard Stark, Jon Snow, with the Night's Watch on the Wall take him among the wildlings of the north. During his terrifying trek, Jon faces many trials and grows increasingly appealing as a character. He also learns about the gathering threats to the Seven Kingdoms in the wild lands.<br /><br />The Lady Catelyn, the widow of Eddard Stark, is also an important figure in the novel. She wields a fair measure of authority as the mother of Robb, now King of the North, but her diplomatic efforts ceaselessly fail and her decisions always turn out to be bad.<br /><br />Tyrion The Dwarf<br />Of all the characters devised by the imagination of Martin, Tyrion Lannister, the reviled dwarf born of his noble family, draws the reader into his life with all the power that a novel can conjure. Despite being often scorned, disliked, and dismissed, Tyrion's power has been growing. He has cultivated a dependable group of cutthroat mercenaries to his side and in this novel his powerful father has installed him as the King's Hand, an important albeit thankless administrative position with the monarchy.<br /><br />Redeeming qualities for Tyrion are his intelligence, sharp tongue, sarcastic aptitude, and political boldness. Along with these strong traits, he gains the devotion of the reader simply by prevailing as a small man in a big world. He always seems to slip away from death despite his lack of friends outside the influence of his ample Lannister purse. Also near the end of the novel, Tyrion joins the fighters defending King's Landing from the invasion of Stannis, and it is Tyrion's strategies that save the city from the inept and inattentive leadership of his sister and regent, Queen Cersei.<br /><br />\\"A Clash Of Kings\\" presents fantasy readers with a robust and intelligent second novel of a series that thrives with complexity and political machinations. Some readers may be intimidated by the length and detail of Martin's fantasy novels, but the reader has little need to try to keep track of everything. Martin has the ability to endow characters with a fullness of life, emotion, ambition, and everything in between that is truly a gift to literature. Readers will care about the characters. Some you will want to throttle. Others you will want to save. While still others will awe you with their majesty, like Daenerys and her three hatchling dragons leading the remnants of her followers through a hostile desert as she seeks her destiny.<br /><br />I graciously give Martin another five sword rating for A Clash of Kings.

B002VPE1WK|5.0|This bag is awesome!  I had looked at the similar Canon bag, but decided not to get it because it has Canon plastered across the front.  Nothing like advertising for thieves.  This bag has all the same qualities, and is a little cheaper.  Great padding on the straps.  Great paadding on the inside.  I don't have much equipment in mine yet, but there is plenty of room for it.  Just get this one!
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I stumbled across this series quite by accident - am I glad I did!! GREAT story lines, wonderful acting ( 2 Aussies in main roles!!) and special FX are SO well done.    One wonders just how much of what is seen on screen is actually happening in research labs that we know nothing about - scary thought, isn't it?    I used to enjoy the X Files, but feel that this is a much more finely crafted show. To have a beautiful, strong woman (Anna Torv) as the lead character is good to see - and the wonderful John Noble as Walter Bishop - the 'mad' scientist - a marvellous combination. Joshua Jackson as Peter Bishop makes them a fine trio to watch.    I look forward to seeing this run for many seasons to come - congratulations to all involved in the making of a very well done sci-fi series.
B0011UF792|5.0|In what i think could be considered a classic good vs evil movie about religion, but is to be taken litely by the extremely religious, for their comedic outlook on religions.  This movie takes out the stops on bashing religions, but in the end brings a bright side to religions. This may seem contradictory, but its a good MOVIE, and that's all it is...A MOVIE! Great characters played by great actors...A MUST SEE!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|If there was a place for 10 stars I would have marked that. I am very pleased with this movie.  Thanks.
B004L3AQLU|5.0|I loved this movie. It had me laughing, and crying, and it was sexy, and poignant, and very, very well acted. Jake and Anne are wonderful together. Very believeable. I could have done with a little less of the \\"brother\\" character, played by Josh Gad, and I wish Jake had more scenes with Hank Azaria and Oliver Platt, but I really did love it. When it ended, I just wanted to go right back to the beginning again!
B001N1DPDE|5.0|NOT A SINGLE COMPLAINT.    worth every penny.    buy one     good for skinning     is a solid pound of knife.
B001GKJ2E8|2.0|If you want to watch gratuitous violence and hackneyed plot this is the movie for you. Angelina Jolie has played so many whiplash women parts I'm beginning to think she isn;t acting she's just being herself. Boo!
B003L20IFQ|4.0|I am not sure why there are so many bad reviews for this movie. I really enjoyed watching this movie. There was a lot suspense and it took a lot of talent to make a movie that is entirely filmed inside of a box the size of a coffin. The scene with the snake was terrifying. I am glad that despite the bad reviews no one dared to tell how this story ended.
0316098337|1.0|I bought this book on my Kindle after reading all the great reviews. It is vague and unbeleiveable even for a fiction. There are so many obvious contradictions in the book. If you are buying this book out of curiousity, then go for it, but don't read it for its reviews. Your expectations from the book will die a horrible death.
B002ZG993Q|1.0|The simplicity and silence of the movie may qualify it for a \\"noire\\" categorization but I have to say whatever money they spent producing this movie was completely wasted.   This was just plain boring and pointless. The first scene started off with potential, leading the viewer to believe there was some thrillingly intense evil plot abound and George Clooney was the hero who was going to figure it all out. That thought ends very very quickly however.  If you don't want the movie to be spoiled JUST IN CASE you might want to waste 2 hours of your life then I'll just say save your time for a movie who's writer actually took the time to create a plot or even a tiny bit of substance, because this movie had neither.  *The only decent thing about this movie was that the scenery was nice      *******SPIOLER ALERT******  For those of you who take my advice but want to know why it was so terrible here's what happened:   Random Swedeish assassins are tracking Clooney. He's on the move, contacts his old \\"boss\\" who says he has another job, and tells him where to hide out from the swedes. Then you find out Clooney is a custom gun maker (big deal). Then the entire middle of the movie is Clooney (in silence, I don't remember any background music to help move it all along) making the gun and dating a hooker, and a few random appearances of a guy who's following him. The conclusion is that the old boss who set Clooney up with this job actually commissoned it himself and is having Clooney build the gun that's going to be used to murder Clooney. (Was that supposed to be ironic poetry?) You never find out why this boss wants to have him killed or why a gun maker is leading a dangerous spy's life. The fact that he's American, other than a few mentions from characters he meets, has absolutely nothing to do with the movie. But, then again, I guess in a movie about nothing why should the title be relevant?
B002HFJ77S|4.0|I am a fan of all Sophie Kinsella books, and this one is delightful as well.  The story line is touching and I found the book hard to put down.  If you enjoy a light, \\"beach read\\" type book, you will likely enjoy this book.
0316098337|5.0|A hard book to put down.  It is a story that has been told before but the author makes it new through the eyes of a child.  It's hard to imagine growing up in a room such as this but it is so realistic that you feel you are sitting in there with the characters.
B0015DROBO|5.0|It wasn't the greatest book ever written but I wanted to keep reading and was sad when it was done.

1439107955|4.0|This book may be considered a history of cancer. It appears to be quite comprehensive. My sole issue with the book is the writing style - it is over-sensational and reads like an exciting adventure rather than a presentation of the history and successes of cancer research and the progress of medicine.  The intent of the book is great. The author's means of presenting it leaves something to be desired.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|Mike, please keep writing and giving us this excellent pleasure. It feels stirred up from centuries, beyond gasping breaths. This should be in every house and played on every stereo as it needs to be. Well Done Mike.  The bodily shape where we all live revolves and music sets us free. Bloody brilliant I must say. Thanks Mike. This cd should have had every grammy and trophy.
B004289ZW0|1.0|The on-off \\"soft-switch\\" is frustrating and doesn't work.  But the real problem with the device is that the \\"blue-tooth\\" light starts to blink and will not sync with the iPad.  And of course, when you try to cycle it off and then back on it will not. I turned off blue tooth and turned off my iPad to see if the GPS would shut it self off.  It did not.  Out of 4 flights, it has only worked once.  25% is terrible for a device  you want to use in flight.
B002NVTBOU|5.0|I first heard about Buika through Amazon, and very much appreciated the option of listening to some sample segments online. Her throaty, sultry voice really works for me, and I love the rich intersection of flamenco, jazz, and cabaret; West Africa and Spain. I am reminded at times of some of the great music coming from Cape Verde, and the music has the power of Portuguese fado, yet in a wonderfully understated way. I have since purchased a second album of Buika's, and it too is richly satisfying - melodically and rhythmically.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|While this movie isn't substantially different from the first one, it does have it's own flavor of creepiness.  Without lobbing spoilers, I will simply say that it dovetails into the first one creatively and effectively.<br /><br />The special effects shots, kept to a minimum, were minimalistic and effective.  Think of the wall of hammers at the hardware store.  So many choices...when in the end, a simple garden variety claw hammer is all you ever need.  The effects were that simple hammer....just a simple implement used to drive the point home.<br /><br />On the one hand, it's fair to say that the movie is rather formulaic.  But...it needs to be.  This is a demonic possession movie and there are rules to follow.  But what this movie does within the boundary of those rules is impressive.<br /><br />Though there were some wooden moments with regard to the acting...it is glossed over, in my mind at least, by the fact that this is intended to be home video style footage and not a movie populated with actors.  It's the reason that it works in spite of those few moments.  It's also the reason that the shaky handicam footage, which I normally loathe (think Diary of the Dead or Cloverfield), works.  While there isn't a lot of character development, I did find that I cared about these people, so it 'sold' the horror they were enduring as more real.<br /><br />I'm not a fan of movies that deal with children in peril, so that may have flavored the dread I had throughout.  But, the film deals with this in a 'minds eye' rather than 'in your face' way; made it unsettling.  There were several points where the goose bumps were instant and intense, and they were never in the \\"BOO!!\\" moments.  That, to me, is what makes a good horror flick, well, good.<br /><br />This is a solid four star movie for anyone that doesn't find shaky video annoying.  I'll watch both again, which is not something I can say for a lot of the horror offerings today.
B002ZG98Z0|4.0|I'll admit - I loved the series on HBO.  Loved, loved, loved it!  I loved the first movie!  I laughed, I cried, I was just so happy the girls were back - me and a couple girlfriends even went to the Miami premier of the movie before it was released in theaters!  I had a feeling the second movie wouldn't live up to the hype of the past movie and didn't want to be disappointed, so I really put off watching it - until the other day.<br /><br />You know what?  It was silly, it was over the top, and Carrie's outfits were really out of control.... but I still liked it!  I thought it was cute and fun and I was so happy to see everybody back and looking fabulous again!<br /><br />I know a lot of people complain that the movies are long - but I love that.  I love that they're written like super-long episodes.  I could sit for hours watching SATC so I have no complaints about that.<br /><br />Once again, I laughed - but I didn't cry - and I still really enjoyed it.  I will say the first movie was better - but isn't that always the case?  I only wish I had taken a chance and seen this movie earlier - when it was still in the theaters.
B00275EHJG|5.0|If ever there was a film that exceeds all expectations it's Pixar's TOY STORY 3, a movie with the familiar cast headed by TOM HANKS and TIM ALLEN as Woody and Buzz Lightyear, respectively, featuring the further adventures of the toy gang everyone fell in love with after the first smash hit.<br /><br />The toys are accidentally abandoned when Andy's mom is helping him pack for college. They end up dumped unceremoniously at a daycare center for kids whom the toys think will appreciate and play with them just as Andy did--with tender, loving care.<br /><br />As they discover on their first day in the playroom, these kids are a nightmare with toys. Woody resolves to return to his owner's attic while the others stay behind until they must plan their great escape. What happens next is unpredictable from start to finish, the only certainty being that there will be a happy ending--which gives the story a final tug on the heartstrings with a poignant and tender conclusion.<br /><br />This is animation that is beyond clever, as imaginative as a film of this kind can get, masterfully staged and brilliantly animated. It's also a bit scary at times since all of the characters almost meet their final destiny a number of times, long before the story is over, thanks to a villainous plush toy bear called Lotso, wonderfully voiced by Ned Beatty, hug-gable on the surface but a scoundrel at the core.<br /><br />Since all the technical stuff is beyond reproach, there's no reason why TOY STORY 3 shouldn't please fans of the first two in this series. It even exceeds expectations with a story of depth, compassion and humor that gets better as it goes along.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004GAXBCE|5.0|Funny movie, would recommend to friends. For some reason, however, I feel like it just didn't match up to Pixar's animated films, but enjoyable nonetheless.
0670022411|5.0|I was drawn into this book from the first page.  You learn about witches, vampires, daemons, history, wine--so much information and told so well!  Can't wait for the rest of this trilogy and more about these characters....they are characters aren't they and not really creatures???  Hard to tell sometimes!
B003DT19F0|4.0|Well to begin I will say that the Tinker Bell series is one of those most rare specimens that actually manages to get better with each entry.  The first one was quite visually rich with the undeniable attention to detail that we've come to expect from the likes of Pixar.  The bad news was that the story and plot structure were most un-Pixar like in terms of sheer cleverness and depth.<br /><br />The second film (The Lost Treasure) improved upon the material slightly by using the same characters established in the first but transferring them to a more stereotypical fantasy-adventure formula.<br /><br />The Great Fairy Rescue, aside from having the lamest package cover-art by far, is undoubtedly the strongest entry of the trio.  It manages to take the strong points of the previous films (the strong characters and stunning CG visuals) and combine them into a plot that many would finally consider up to the standards of the companies responsible for the whole series (Disney & the recently absorbed Pixar).<br />The plot goes like this: In our world young Lizzy and her father have just moved into a countryside cottage. Lizzy, obsessed with fairies, finds herself at odds with her scientific father who just so happens to be.. a scientist.  His particular expertise happens to be cataloging butterfly species while motherless Lizzy draws, paints and constructs homes for fairies.  Before long the title character finds herself face-to-face with Lizzy and her by-the-books father.  The remaining fairies mount a rescue effort amidst adverse conditions before their species ends up becoming an exhibit at the science museum.<br />There is a decidedly British slant to this one (which is only right considering the original Peter Pan was set in London).  Much of this film's charm stems from the simple fact that the back-story is one centered on a very human family dynamic with the fantastical fairies becoming the catalyst for the action (not unlike another Disney/ Pixar computer generated franchise you may have heard of, Toy Story).<br /><br />Apologies are certainly in order from all of the critics and naysayers who trounced on the original Tinker Bell film with complaints of her having gained the ability to speak in this series as this, the third film, demonstrates quite clearly that her ability to vocalize with her fellow fairies is rather different from what human ears perceive.  Kudos, Diz, for the attention to detail!  Little Tink's communication abilities may have been redeemed here but there is no denying that some of the fiery temper she displays in the Peter Pan films has been watered down.<br /><br />The casting, which has never been a weak link in this series, seems to be best suited for the type of dynamic the Great Fairy Rescue sets up, which doesn't really have a \\"villain\\" per se so much as a series of natural consequences directly resulting from decisions made within.  Even the iniquitous Vidia of the first film has apparently taken a turn for the better; now more of a trouble-making cohort than a dedicated antagonist.<br /><br />I suppose in looking back at the series as a whole, it can be said that each entry brings something unique to the table.  The first may be the weakest but it does a nice job of establishing the characters.  The second will likely be the most appealing of the trio to younger boy viewers thanks to a decidedly heavy fantasy angle that works on many levels and this, the third finally manages to capture the charm and cleverness that has become synonymous with the Disney brand.<br /><br />However, I should note that thanks to a deeply placed sneak peek, it appears a fourth entry in the series is in the works entitled Tinker Bell and the Mysterious Winter Woods.<br /><br />Realistically this news shouldn't come as much of a surprise considering each film thus far has centered on a season (the first was spring, the second fall, the third summer).  A winter-themed entry has been inevitable since the franchise's onseteven though rumors of the filmmakers' plans to keep the property a trilogy have been dashed in the process.  The real question now is will they decide to pull the plug after four? All of the seasons may be covered but somehow I suspect Disney will manage to convince us that these little magical fairies are responsible for more than just the color of the leaves and the disappearance of the snow.<br /><br />Only time will tell for sure, but after having completed The Great Fairy Rescue, it's safe to say that the franchise has gotten only stronger all along so it's hopeful to suspect that continuing the tale will only carry on the trend.ty a trilogy have been dashed in the process.

B003EY7IRC|5.0|This ending to the Fever series lived up to all my expectations.  KMM kept us guessing right up to the end and I loved every minute of it.      Shawdowfever is the fifth book in a five book series.  The books should be read in order and you'd miss a lot if you skipped one.  This is one long story that has been divided into five books that leave you wanting more each time.      I can't wait to see what KMM's next series has instore for us!

0439023521|4.0|I avoided this book for a long time, dismissing it as just (overwrought) young adult fiction.  What a mistake.  Hunger Games is a compulsive, edge-of-the-seat, what will happen next read.      I could not put this novel aside.  Katniss Everdean represents her hometown district in the annual Hunger Games, wherein she must fight to the death for pure entertainment value.  She is an interesting character, a capable, tough girl, not willing to be a tool for the government.  But she is also a teenage girl, caught in the angst of her emotions and she is cleary drawn to two boys, one from her district and one from the Hunger Games.    At times the story slowed down as Katniss explored and tried to reconcile her feeling; hence 4 out of 5 stars.  Other times, the  story propelled forward as the action in the arena unfolded. Suzanne Collins is a master at suspension.  I literally could not put this book down until I was done.  A great read.
014241543X|4.0|I heard many wonderful things about this book and it made many people's top books of the year list for last year, so I was excited to listen to it.  I listened to this on audio book and at 5 hrs in length, it is a quick listen.  It was well done and the narrator did an excellent job conveying Mia's emotions throughout.  I have mixed feelings about this book, it was very well done...but at times the characters seemed too perfect to be realistic.  There is supposed to be sequel to this book called [[ASIN:0525422943 Where She Went]] which is going to be released in April 2011.<br /><br />Mia survives the car crash that kills her family, but is in a coma.  While in the hospital her, spirit (for lack of a better description), can follow around those she loves within the hospital but can't interact with them.  The book takes place over a day or two and in that time the story alternates between Mia's struggle for life in the hospital and flashbacks to important moments in Mia's life.  Ultimately Mia must decide does she stay and deal with her broken body and the death of her family? Or does she go on to whatever is next?<br /><br />I will start out by saying this is an emotional book.  So if you don't like books that make you cry then don't read this book.  I personally am not overly fond of books that make me cry, that being said this book also made me laugh at points.  It was a very emotion evoking book that I will definitely think back to many times.  It definitely leaves a lasting impression and makes you think about your life.<br /><br />There were a lot of things this book that were done very well.  The transitions between the scenes with Mia's current body at the hospital and scenes from Mia's past were very well done.  They never seemed awkward and flowed very nicely.  I also liked that the relationship between the characters.  The characters had their problems, but they always worked things out by discussing what was going on.  The characters were all very mature and acted like mature adults...even the teenagers.  I loved the theme of music throughout the novel and how music and the characters' love for it tied so many things together.<br /><br />Mia was a great character and you are pulling for her throughout. The same can be said for all of the characters surrounding her as well.<br /><br />This leads me to the biggest problem I had with this book.  All the characters were too perfect.  I kept thinking that if everyone in the world acted as mature as the characters in the book did \\"wow, what a great place this world would be!\\"  Mia's best friend was always so thoughtful and just did everything perfect.  Mia's boyfriend, is a punk rocker who is more sensitive, caring, understanding, and discerning than just about any person I've ever met.  All of the characters act perfectly to every situation, and it seemed a bit contrived.  Don't get me wrong for the most part it made for a good story, but at points I was rolling my eyes thinking \\"Oh come on, is that what they would really do in a situation like this?\\"<br /><br />Overall this is a great read; it tackles serious issues around life and death and intersperses it with enough occasional humor to make it not too depressing of a read.  That being said this book will make you cry, it is sad and touching at points.  I personally am not big into books like this, so I probably won't read the sequel.  I did like the references to music woven throughout though and it is a sweet and touching read with characters that are innately good.  It should be suitable for all young adult and older readers, the scenes depicting the injuries after the car accident get a bit graphic but other than that it is pretty PG.ults...even the teenagers.

B004KWVDWI|5.0|I became a Steve McQueen fan after watching \\"The Great Escape\\".  Wow, what a film!  After that experience, I began to explore his other films.    Enter Papillon.  A very interesting story (although based on Henri'Charriere own experiences, some dispute the validity thereof) of the title character's escape from Devil's Island (French Guiana) in the early 20th century.  It features Dustin Hoffman as Dega and Steve McQueen as Papillon.  It features the director of Patton and Planet of the Apes, Franklin J. Schaffner.  Very memorable.

B0006399FS|3.0|Much before I listened to this U2 album, I anticipated QUALITY due to its garnering of Album of the Year, the reason I got it in the first place. Song of the Year was awarded to \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\" albeit the love hostility in it; the chorus says, \\"And it's you when I don't pick up the phone\\" along with other relative indications.<br /><br />1. \\"Vertigo\\"- Nothing really wrong with this fantasy song. 5/5<br /><br />2. \\"Miracle Drug\\"- Too slow for me, but the lyrics about human value and urgent psychic ability aren't bad. 4/5<br /><br />3. \\"Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own\\"- Too slow for me, and the subtle remarks about instability in a relationship just isn't good. 2/5<br /><br />4. \\"Love Peace or Else\\"- Okay tempo. I don't like the implications of lack of confidence in this song, but love is vital. 3/5<br /><br />5. \\"City of Blinding Lights\\"- Nice imaginary/scenery song. Wasn't strong as it could be. And it has the line, \\"What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?\\" 3/5<br /><br />6. \\"All Because of You\\"- \\"Everything was ugly but your beautiful face.\\" 4/5<br /><br />7. \\"A Man and a Woman\\"- Not feeling the line, \\"But you're gone and so is God.\\" \\"I've been sleeping in the street again\\" makes this sound unfortunate. Sonically, it's exquisite and sounds a bit foreign. Rest of the lyrics are acceptable. 3/5<br /><br />8. \\"Crumbs From Your Table\\"- Maligning. 2/5<br /><br />9. \\"One Step Closer\\"- Once again, not feeling the subtle uncertainties or lack of confidence presented. Too slow. 2/5<br /><br />10. \\"Original of the Species\\"- Acceptable slow tempo. Delicious guitar riffs. Lovely track. 5/5<br /><br />11. \\"Yaweh\\"- Bad way to finish the album! \\"Take this heart and make it break.\\" 2/5<br /><br />35/55= 64% grade.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I just love this show! It is everything it ought to be. It covers everything from family worries, romance, hardships, faith, financial struggles, and even some politics, and more! Set in the late 1800's, it is a most pleasant and delightful show to watch, and leaves me feeling jolly! There is no indecency in this show which you find too much of in other modern made day jibberish tv shows that are on the telly. I also have seasons 2 and 3 and am going to be purchasing season 4 as well! I just wish this show continued. A shame to see it go. It is a real joy to watch, and the acting is superb! I can't wait until the end of the day at work so I can go home to watch it!  My most favourite of all! Great for families!
0375704027|4.0|It's the kind of book that takes up a few hours in a day or two (or a few commutes) and you're finished. Lovely and sad love story, original for sure but deep? Not so much. Murakami definitely has the magic touch for writing some highly readable... I was just disappointed that the story and characters didn't evolve a bit more.
B001675YQ6|5.0|It's sad to say that it was Brittany Murphy's untimely death that put me on to this movie.  I thought at the time \\"I've never heard of her and she's being called a great/good actress\\".  So I checked out a few of her movies.  This was the best although \\"Ramen Girl\\" had a certain offbeat charm and a great location (Tokyo).    Why I like this movie?  - great iconic London settings  - great wardrobe  - the irrepressible Brittany  - brilliant cast:  the casting director deserves a prize - from the drop dead gorgeous male lead to the others.  All more or less well-known accomplished romantic comedy actors (despite a previous reviewer's comments).    Brittany's character and commitment to acting shine through.  Yes, she was very talented and also underrated.  So sad I only discovered her after her death.    Incidentally, the extras / interviews are also interesting.
1423101472|5.0|The Last Olympian is in fact one of the best books I've ever read. In my opinion it's the best one in the series. Rick Riordan is an amazing author. The way he combines his knowledge of Greek mythology and some fiction is just something you don't see in every author. This book in fact deserves all the five stars I'm giving it and even more. I recommend you read this book or this series in general.
0375842209|5.0|Mark Zusak has crafted a novel full of heart. Don't let it's being marketing as Young Adult Fiction turn you off from reading it if you're not a young adult. The main character is a young girl, but the themes are ones worthy of pondering no matter what your age. The Book Thief has the ability to break down the walls of cynicism despite the dire circumstances it often describes. Great work, Mr. Zusak.

B004BLJQOK|3.0|LET ME IN is more accessible than its Swedish original. LET THE RIGHT ONE IN.  It's also more a love story than just a straight up horror movie, although the horror there.<br />Set in a hauntingly beautiful winter in New Mexico, the movie centers on a bullied 12 yr old boy who befriends his new 12 yr old neighbor, a strange 12 yr old girl who walks barefoot in the snow.<br />The cast is perfect:  Kodi Smit-McPhee, whose angelic facade hides inner anger and fury; Chloe Moretz, glowing in quiet despair; the excellent Richard Jenkins, burdened with guilt; and Elias Koteas as the persistent detective.<br />LET ME IN is a good vampire story, just a tad slow, but a smartly made movie.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I couldnt understand the craze with this series of books so I decided to see what it was all about. I started reading and at first had a hard time with the translations and all the political information just thrown at you in the first couple of chapters. But I kept going anyway and it was worth it. The book was definately a page turner I couldnt put it down. Once I finished the book I needed to know the rest of the story so I bought the 2nd book in the series and once again it was soo worth it. I dont know which one was better because both story lines were so good. But you definately have to read the books in order or somethings just wont make sense. I am now awaiting for the third book to arrive and cant wait to read it.
B003YLK2RI|5.0|First, let me say that I am not going to really talk about the bonus disk.  As far as I'm concered, only the live concert footage is important, and that is what you are paying your $20 for.    With that being said, this DVD is incredible!  In front of 80,000 fans, Slipknot - the worlds greatest metal band, at the peak of their career so far - play the best songs from all four of the studio albums.    The band does an amazing job playing, and in my opinion this concert is way better than the Disasterpieces DVD, and maybe a little bit better than the 9.0 live C.D.    The track list (18 songs) is just about perfect on this album, even though they only play 3 songs from the \\"All Hope Is Gone\\" album.    And now to talk about the sound quality:      Like every rock concert, the sound quality and performance gets better as the concert goes on.  While the sound on the first song is a little \\"off\\" (but by no means bad sounding), by the fifth song - \\"get this\\", the band sounds awsome.    The balance between all of the instruments and vocals is just about perfect, although the vocals on the chorus of \\"Sulfer\\" could have been a little bit louder.  Mick and Jim's guitars are perfectly in-tune, tight, clean, clear, heavy and loud.  Even though Jim improvises some of his lead parts, they always fit in really good with the music.  Both Slipknot guitar players are virtuosos - they play perfectly even when they head-bang and go crazy - and this show is just another example of that fact.    Of course, there are some flaws in the drumming, but considering how difficult and fast some of these songs are, that is understandable.  If you are not a drummer though, you won't even notice these flaws.  As usual, Joey Jordisons playing is incredible, and even though the band actually speeds up some of their songs, he handles them very well.  I'll also mention that the snare drum marching band sections of \\"The Blister Exists\\"  are amoung the highlights of the concert.  All three drummers sound very tight, and the pattern they play in that section is one of the coolest drum parts I've ever heard.    Corey Taylor does a very good job of singing and screaming in key, and re-creating acurately his vocal parts from the studio albums.  I actually think he sounds a lot better here than in the 9.0 live C.D.    So that's basically it.  If you have any interest in Slipknots music whatsoever, I don't think it would be possible not to be blown away by this concert.  Ignore what people say about the other disk.  You are paying $20 for an incredible live DVD with 18 awsome songs, and the contents of the second disk (actually pretty cool) are just free bonus features.    Buy this DVD right now (whether you are totally unfamiliar with Slipknot, or a hardcore fanatic) and you will not regret it.  What an adrenaline rush!

030726999X|4.0|I decided to start writing reviews since I always read through them before buying a book. After reading the first two books, there was no way I wasn't going to finish the series.  I thought it was a satisfying conclusion.  Compelling series.
1439133948|2.0|This was the most eagerly anticipated item on my Christmas list this year. I discovered Miles Vorkosigan several years ago, plowed through all 13 books (if I'm counting right), and then stalked Bujold's myspace page as I salivated for more.<br /><br />Sadly, this is the worst book in the series. It really hurts to say that because I love this universe so much and I tried so hard to like this book. I love how Bujold always tries to do something different with each novel, trying out different sub-genres (SF mystery, SF romance, etc.) and how she matures her characters.<br /><br />But this just isn't well written. The opening sequence had no connection to the rest of the plot. Coincidences abounded. The plot dragged. We didn't really get to see any of the sociological effects of putting huge portions of the population in cryosleep. There were no complications - when Miles decided to do something crazy, it all happened according to plan.<br /><br />I could forgive all of these things, but the nail in the coffin was the fact that there were no STAKES here. Miles is content. His family is safe. Basically this entire book is Miles deciding to dig around because he's kinda curious. But he's never really in danger. The \\"bad guy\\" is just an anonymous corporation that might possibly someday maybe do something bad. At any point in the book, he could have simply packed up and gone home. About a third of the way into the book Bujold tries to force an explanation on the reader, which just makes it worse - because it's basically going \\"HEY! Look! Nobody has any motivations here!\\"<br /><br />I've always loved how Bujold pushes her characters to the edge - whether physically, mentally, or emotionally. She takes them to the brink of destruction, and sometimes pushes them over, before they find a way back. Cryoburn had none of that spark, that immediacy.<br /><br />When I got to the \\"event\\" at the end of the book (trying not to give away spoilers here) it felt tacked on. Like maybe Bujold had spaced out writing Cryoburn because what she was really thinking about was setting things up for the next book. And the end really did belong with The Next Book.<br /><br />If you're a Miles fan, I recommend you pick this up in the bookstore, flip to the last chapter, read it, and then put the book back down.<br /><br />If you're Ms. Bujold... you really need to find some more critical beta readers.ecause what she was really thinking about was setting things up for the next book.

B001NLKT60|4.0|I decided to start writing reviews since I always read through them before buying a book. I would recommend reading The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo first.  I felt like this was actually a faster read, but I missed the direct interaction between the main characters.  The series has a way of sucking you in, and I enjoyed the ride.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|I have seen this films many times in my life, but never in all its subtle nuances until the Blu-Ray transfer.  The color in every aspect was stunning. The costumes, the background, the castle sets glowed with life.  I have owned this movie on VHS, dvd and laser disc, but nothing matches the Blu-Ray.  The sound was okay--not much you can do about that, but all the actors voices came in crystal clear. Best transfer ever.
B0015DROBO|4.0|I decided to start writing reviews since I always read through them before buying a book. This book has so much hype attached to it, that it has an up-hill climb to meet expectations. I found the first half of the book slow, and there were times I wondered what all the fuss was about.  Then it sort of gets a jolt, breakthroughs happen, and I was sucked in. I'm fine with fictional sex and violence, but anyone who is a bit prudish would hate this book. Don't worry too much about all the names that are thrown at you. Just read it and trust that even those in the bleacher seats will be able to follow the action.
B0006Z2LP6|5.0|Sent a VHS at first when I ordered a DVD and contacted them and they sent out the DVD and still got it before the last shipping date.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I have only one thing to say. WOW! The moment i started reading this book i did not want to put it down. Jason's lost memory and mysteriousness, not to mention the son of zeus's roman half, totaly adds the eletricity, literally, between him and Piper. Now i cant forget about Leo, he is burning up. He is pretty much the only flame thrower in like a bazillion years. this book is so amazing dont waste ur time looking for books because this book is perfect for anyone beacause it has action, comedy, and love. ooo la la! lol hope u enjoy
B001QOGYFO|5.0|This is a good film. I am a huge Kate Beckinsale fan and i believe her performance in this movie was great. This movie was very suspenseful and had many twist and turns. This is a definite buy. I suggest you buy other Kate Beckinsale films because she is a great actress.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Awesome show, too bad it was canceled. But what I bought I got a for a great price and it is a very good show that will make you think.
B002KSPKRS|4.0|Overall sound quality is really good. Effect button to add more bass is a plus. The only problem I had was the cracking sound. I could hear it quite often.  Before I bought the X-41, I bought the X-31. Both X-31 and X-41 have the cracking sound problem. It doesn't matter where I put the wireless transmitter, the cracking sound will occur.  I ended up returning both the X-31 and X-41.    I will be trying the upcoming PX5 that will come out in March/April 2011? Hopefully that one will fix the cracking sound. I highly doubt that since it's probably using the same transmitter anyway. They probably only added the bluetooth connectivity.  And since only a few people having the issue of cracking sound, Turtle Beach will ignore this issue anyway.    Note: I have tried the Logitech wireless headset F540. That one has no cracking sound issue at all. Except that I don't feel comfortable wearing it. That's all. Felt like it's too tight/too pressing on the ear.
0060775858|5.0|As observed by others, There is something in this book that babies like.. May be the alternate color and B&W pages or something else..But 5 stars for this book which somehow intrigues my otherwise naughty and restless son. All other night time books like pajama time etc were waste of money for me.
030746363X|5.0|This book is GREAT. Fast arrival. Didn't realize it was such a thick book! Can't wait to get it all read! So much cheaper than the book store. THANKS!
B002ZG97EC|5.0|I just love this movie. It is so funny. The minions are hilarious and there is also a heart warming side. Both my kids loved it and one is 5 and the other 16 months. This is definitely a movie everyone in the family will love. My husband even loved it and he hates \\"cartoons\\".
B002ZG980U|5.0|Quite  a good film to watch it several times.  Fantastic soundtrack.  Will lose your grip on reality though.  The basic concept of it is quite fasinating. Wish I saw it at IMAX theater. But still a great distraction on     Then Read    [[ASIN:1598530496 The Philip K. Dick Collection]]DVD
B004GBIE3Y|5.0|Kind of funny, also serious, this was an excellent coming-of-age movie. Great cast. Good music. Things weren't so supercharged when I went to high school, but I could still relate.     (There were maybe a couple of moments when I had to suspend disbelief, but none that jerked me out of the movie.)
B003ODL004|5.0|This soundtrack turned the Film into a good movie! In particular I dug track 5.  Dreamlike but intense. I belive hans Zimmer has done the modern Batman score as well. For some reason I like this far better.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I love action flicks. What's even better about \\"Red\\" as an action flick is its cast. And this is not just any cast, but one filled only with retirement age actors (well, maybe Bruce Willis isn't quite there, but he acts as if he is). OK, maybe Mary Louise Parker isn't quite there either, but she's also excellent as Willis's love interest.<br /><br />So, what's to like about an action flick starring old actors? (When one is the same age as the actors, one is allowed to call them old.)<br /><br />1. Humor in an action flick? Yeah, it's been done for years--Clint Eastwood and Schwarzenegger with their punchy one-liners. This time Morgan Freeman gets the line: \\"We're getting the band back together.\\" It was funny in the television promos--it's even funnier in context. Ms Parker expresses her extreme displeasure with the Willis characther--with her mouth duct-taped! While the viewer may not know the exact words behind her anger, her meaning is quite clear. It's an excellent delivery complete with facial expressions and perfect comedic timing.<br /><br />2. Romance. Willis and Parker? Yes, and the actors make it work even though he is retired R-E-D (retired, extremely dangerous) and she is a seemingly mild-mannered, cubicle-retirement clerk. However, in their conversations together he learns the way to divine her heart. He reads all the romance novels she reads. She also has a true hankering to travel to exotic places. When she tells him she wants to go to Chile, he says he's been there. The thing with his travels is the reason and the time, often by cover of night and to relieve someone of his ugly, hateful life. He's been to Chile, but hasn't experienced Chile.<br /><br />3. Larger than life characters.<br />Freeman has participated in Vietnam and Afghanistan and now is 80 years old (is Freeman really that old?) and living in a nice retirement home with his dose of excitement gained from eyeballing a beautiful, young aid's gluts. He also has stage four liver cancer.<br />Helen Mirren as the lovely, refined mistress of a country estate, filling her hours with baking and flower arranging--and the occasional hit. As she tells Ms Parker: \\"I kill people.\\"<br />Karl Urban plays the adversary--a deep CIA special ops hit man. His job is to eliminate Willis's character. The reasons are eventually revealed and they are a doozy.<br />John Malkovich plays an over-the-top paranoid, well, an Oliver Stone type. But Malkovich is hilarious, especially showing his pleasure at Willis's storage facility filled with weapons and munitions of extreme measures.<br /><br />3. An expose of the great and secret powers of the CIA. Ernest Borgnine's character and his job and its location and purpose are prime examples. But there's more.<br /><br />4. Weapons galore! Fun with weapons! An example: one soldier shoots a grenade at Malkovich who uses his weapon to bat it back to the soldier who then is blown up. A fierce, red-headed, female agent calls Malkovich Grandpa. He must show her what \\"grandpas\\" can do. She shoots a small missile at him--he shoots a bullet from a handgun directly into the center of that missile, causing blow back of the explosion and getting rid of that potty mouth agent (older people don't like being reminded of their age!)<br /><br />5. A serious message amid all the shenanigans: the abuse of power in whatever place for whatever reason. Richard Dreyfus plays--with great flair--a powerful villain and how his power has distorted whatever tenuous connection he may have with the human race.<br /><br />6. Quirkiness (but I suppose part of the humor)--Mirren wears a lovely, long white evening gown to a presidential party bid. Later Malkovich gives her a pair of combat boots to wear for their role in taking down the powerfully corrupt. Just a little quirky! Malkovich's house is inside a car. Let me rephrase. One enters his dwelling through the trunk. That's all I'll say.<br /><br />7. I could put Brian Cox in any category. As a retired Soviet spy who hasn't killed anyone in years, he is almost a scene stealer.<br /><br />What a fun, fun movie (despite the various forms of violence). There's only one kiss, no, make that two (Freeman gets one) and just a few I love you's, giving this action flick a touch of heart.fun movie (despite the various forms of violence). There's only one kiss, no, make that two (Freeman gets one) and just a few I love you's, giving this action flick a touch of heart.
B0007939NO|5.0|I have always loved this movie, and I was very excited to be able to purchase it. I hadn't seen it in probably 10 years, and it was as good as I remembered.
B000069HZP|5.0|This has always been one of my all-time favorite movies. Far beyond an ordinary thriller, the story takes the viewer on an incredible journey of the mind and how it shapes our reality and colors our perceptions through experiences, desires, guilt, shame or pride, the past, as well as hopes and fears for the future. Michael Douglas as Nicholas Van Orton perfectly portrays the tension of a successful businessman who is still vulnerable to the shadows of his past and his wishes for something more. Sean Penn plays the black sheep, gift bearing brother Conrad Van Orton.<br /><br />Do not miss.<br /><br />Directed by David Fincher,'se7en, 'Fight Club' etc.
B003L20ICE|3.0|After all the hype about this movie, I found it to be quite boring.  There were a handful of funny scenes and a few touching moments, which is why I've given it three stars - but overall, watching it was a waste of time.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|Reality TV taken to a whole new level. An entire life broadcast for the world to see, yet the star of the show never signed on the dotted line. Many can probably relate to feeling duped into the life they are living. What happens when the curtain is pulled back? When a glimpse behind the scenes is caught? When your whole world is turned upside down? When no one is who you thought they were? Even you?<br /><br />This film has so much to say, about the jaded, voyeuristic and shallow nature of human beings, to the potential, strength and innocence inherent in all beings as well. Jim Carrey as Truman Burbank, the unwitting star of the show, portrays a great depth beneath his usual comedic flair. Ed Harris is perfect as the controlling, self-serving, dad/mastermind. Laura Linney is downright spooky as Truman's wife, especially as things start to unravel.<br /><br />Directed by Peter Weir
B000KKPN5C|4.0|First let me point out that I am not a professional photographer, I'm an enthusiast and hobbyist,and a tech junkie. I do go out on shooting walks but I mostly take family pictures and also do pictures for friends.<br /><br />I originally bought a [[ASIN:B000JC9BXG Sunpak PF30XN Digital SLR Camera Dedicated i-TTL Flash for Nikon]]Which at first was great aside from the slow charge times. It worked well, was never let down by the power and the pictures came out great. I honestly thought that I wouldn't need to ever buy another flash, however that flash one day decided to stop working at the beginning of an all day shoot and I didn't have a back up, strangely enough a few days later the flash started working again for no reason. Believe me I checked all the usual suspects and couldn't find any reason to this. After that experience I decided to bite the bullet and spend 120 bucks on this flash and I have to say I have no regrets. This flash works great with my D3000.<br /><br />When I first tried the flash I found that it seemed that the iTTL system was geared towards direct flash which meant it was underpowered when using bounce flash with a semi-high ceiling, however going in to the manual controls of my device and setting the flash power allowed me to compensate for this easily enough for better bounce flash. In fact when I went in to the settings and put it at even half power my pictures came out overexposed which really amazed me because I didn't realize just how powerful this little guy would be. If I there was a button on this flash that allowed you to compensate without having to go in to settings then that would be killer, but I knew it didn't have it going in so I'm not going to lower my rating because of this.<br /><br />One more thing worth pointing out is that this flash is fast, super fast, it never slows me down at all for continuous shots and after the initial charge I never have to wait for it to charge during a shoot.<br /><br />Compared to most flashes this one is small and the design is such that it does not stick up far at all. I highly recommend this product. Esgn is such that it does not stick up far at all. I highly recommend this product. Es
1401216676|5.0|I finally got around to reading what I've heard was one of the best Batman stories ever told.  Alan Moore, who I don't hero worship like many comics fans, pens such a complete look at how the Joker works and thinks and why.  Brian Bolland gives the definitive Joker.  Every panel is amazing.  He conveys so much with just a look.  Overall, this a fantastic book.
B00000J048|4.0|Definitely go buy the manufacturers age recommendation.  i bought this for my 1.5 year old and he doesn't quite get the concept yet.  Also the pieces get lost easily since there are so many.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I bought this hoping to get a \\"PS2\\" controller that I could hook up to my pc via bluetooth. I got that, with a little twist.     The L2 and R2 buttons have been turned into triggers! It feels a little cheap like I might break them, and definitely a change from the dualshock 2.    Not a big deal, and it's still a wonderful controller, but for those of you thinking you'll be receiving a wireless ps2 controller (more or less), you aren't.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I found this book to be a truly refreshing read. It breaks free from so many of the bindings that modern fantasy suffers from and takes the reader back to what first drew them to reading good fantasy in the first place. This is a journey to another time and place and Kvothe is a fascinating hero. The style and tale continually hint at a much larger and more detailed world and story than that which can be contained in this book. I for one hope that when the trilogy is complete, there are still stories left untold and mysteries in the world that Kvothe and the other characters inhabit. \\"The Name of the Wind\\" was everything I was looking for and more. I read a number of reviews and had my hopes high and it was so nice to have my expectations exceeded by a book for the first time in a long time.     To compare this to any other story or Rothfuss to any other author I've read would be cliche, at best.  Like the best stories, it combines a number of elements that are familiar and that's okay as long as, the story you are reading reminds you of these others but, doesn't suffer through the comparison. \\"The Name of the Wind\\" doesn't suffer from comparing it to some of the greats in fantasy.     I found the dialogue incredibly clever and at times genuinely hilarious. The character development was tremendous and the story was told in the finest fashion. It leaves the reader wanting more as it goes along and savoring every page as it nears its conclusion. Really, good story telling at its finest and one of the very best that I've read in a long, long time. I can't wait for \\"Wise Man's Fear\\" because Day One will be a tough one to follow!
B004DK5CW4|5.0|After looking at the dvd of Secretariat several times i enjoy it more & more  I actually saw Secretariat's races on TV as he won each race, i have never forgotten  his greatness! When he ran the Belmont, i thought he decided to just show the other  horses in the race THIS IS HOW TO GOOOO! The movie captures all of the great moments  of his career as well as the people who so believed in him, the actors were perfect in  their roles. To me it is a great, happy, time which i for one, need to revisit! What  a Happy Day that was!
0439023513|4.0|Before angry villagers come to my virtual door with pitchforks and burning torches, I would like to say that I enjoyed this novel very much. Did I enjoy it as much as The Hunger Games and Catching Fire? No, I didn't and I will tell you why I didn't.<br /><br />Mockingjay was the final showdown. The Districts are in full rebellion against the Capitol or are being taken over by the rebels. Katniss was the unwitting face to this rebellion and finally decides she will accept the responsibility of being the \\"Mockingjay.\\"<br /><br />That's all great, but I am not a big fan of wars and battles. This novel, centering around the revolt against the Capitol, was filled with battles. I could have handled some battle action, but I think there was too much of it. It made me very impatient with the novel because I, as the reader, am invested in Katniss, Peeta, Prim, and even Gale. I felt like their stories took a backseat to the details of the rebellion and the battles.<br /><br />What happened to Peeta and Prim through the course of this novel broke my heart but then put it back together again, and that I loved. I don't do spoilers so I won't comment on specifics, but I cried several times throughout Mockingjay and the crying revolved around Peeta and Prim's stories.<br /><br />Katniss will forever be one of my all time favorite heroines. Her development throughout the course of the trilogy was exceptional. Her bravery in all three novels, particularly this one, is...well, I'm not sure I can find the word for it. What she does and is willing to suffer for her loved ones is regal.<br /><br />I thought the end of Mockingjay was a very fitting end to the trilogy. I have absolutely no qualms with the ending. Katniss ended up with the love interest that I personally was rooting for, and she was an older, wiser, and happier Katniss.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this novel. I wholeheartedly recommend this book and trilogy. Read it before the movie comes out!
030745455X|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and Lisbeth is one of my favorite characters of all time. You find out a lot more about her background here and better understand the way she is and the choices she makes.<br /><br />There were a couple things that were mentioned and not developed and some illogical police work. Why didn't they go interview Palmgren?
015206057X|5.0|My son went through a phase where he just loved babies and pictures of people (he's since moved on to cars and trains).  This was the perfect book for that.  He'd request it by asking to \\"read Babies\\" and then demand \\"again, again!\\" as soon as we were done.  He had one baby in particular that he loved to look at, and since she turned up on several different pages, it was fun for him to pick her out.  A good reminder that no matter where/who we are and what our differences are, there are always similarities between us all too.
0739465325|5.0|The complexity of grammar decays over time due to the \\"laziness\\" of the speakers of the language. As an example, English lost most of its cases, except in its personal pronouns (he, his, him) The author adresses this, but, more importantly, he describes how complex case endings came into being to begin with. The book is well-written and readily accessible to a layman, even though it would probably be more enjoyable to someone with knowledge of an inflected language such as latin.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Ms. Harkness has combined witches, daemons and vampires in a very absorbing story. I could not put it down, and was totally wrapped up in the story...to the point of reading till 3 a.m. I think for the length of the book it is priced very reasonablly. If the sample does not catch you...then you are wasted on this fine novel.
B0044XV3R8|1.0|When the first edition came out I waited because I thought a better edition of the dvd would come out, then I made the mistake to buy this edition when it came out.    I can't believe I have to stop watching the movie, sand up and go and change the discs!     The movie (in the extended \\"collector's\\" extended edition) stops after the mating between Jake and Navi, the movie will stop and a message will apear saying \\"the aventure continues on disc two!\\" - that's just a kick in the groins.    I wish I didn't buy this thing, the VHS era was more than ten years ago and it looks like we're going back.    DON'T BUY THIS DVD.
1400052173|5.0|This is the story of a woman, Henrietta Lacks, whose cancer cells removed from her body spawned an entire industry, that of cell/tissue culture. These cells, named HeLa were immortal, hence the name of the book. But this book wasn't just about cell culture although it was a very good summary of some of the early work. The story is mostly about Henrietta's life and death and about how the author went about gathering information for the book, so part of the book is about the book writing. Although this should have been dull, it wasn't. Rebecca Skloot did a wonderful job jumping between the four themes of the book: the history of cell culture, Henrietta's life and death, the writing of the book and how Henrietta's family came to grips with what had happened. Skoot wrote about the science in a very understandable manner that anyone, even without a background in science, will understand. Ultimately, a lot of good has come from Henrietta Lacks and in a certain way she is a posthumous hero. This was a great book and I recommend it for everyone interested in science, history and ethics.
B002ZG98C8|1.0|First, let me say this.... I am a fan of Robert Rodriguez... I like his other movies.  I am also a long time fan of Danny Trejo.  I love Steven Seagal, Robert Deniro, Michelle Rodgriguez, et al (except for Lindsey Lohan... and maybe Jessica Alba).  I like shoot 'em up, vigilante movies a lot, but come on people!  This has got to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen!!!  OMG!!! Within the 1st 5-10 minutes I knew it was a bad film.  I watched all of it in the hopes it would get better, but it never did.  DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR $$$$$$!  It has definitely come off my wish list!  You couldn't pay me to take the movie!  If you haven't gotten my point.... it's a bad movie!!!  I'm sure the wonderful actors in the movie did the best they could w/ the script.  I think it COULD have been a good movie....but it wasn't!  I can't believe Robert Rodriguez even had anything to do with this one! AAAAAGGGHHHH!
B000089RVX|5.0|When this album was released in March 2003, it was with very little fanfair and barely made an impact anywhere but by the end of the year it had almost changed the face of rock/metal as we know it, how? The answer is that there had never been a female fronted rock/metal band that had struck a chord with so many male and female listeners alike like Evanescence. The album was dark enough to be cool but yet still accessible enough to be played on commercial radio, one could even argue that this album kick started the goth/emo craze that followed, with bands like My Chemical Romance, Fall Out Boy and Panic at the Disco all going platmium in the following years after this release. Listening to this album 8 years later it still sounds fresh and original and its hard to think of an album since then that has made such a bold musical statement as this did

B0018O4YSQ|5.0|This Director's Cut gives a clear understanding of this fantastic movie. Many of the \\"Matrix\\" concepts can be seen on this story, at least an year earlier. The story behind reminds me of the eternal search of the human soul, the human spirit, as they try to pass characteristics of an individual to another one. One day you are a family guy, totally devoted to your wife, and in another day you become a serial-killer. I really enjoy the story and the production. The director's cut is even more interesting, and the blu-ray gives you additional features to understand the differences and the reason why the theater version was so different.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|I'm pretty much split right down the middle on Children of Men. Artistically, I loved it and pretty much every other way I thought it was a bore, overly contrived and ultimately a waste of time.<br /><br />On the artsy side I thought it was beautifully filmed and directed. On the other side, I thought the story was muddled and at times confusing with characters who were very much un-(and under)developed.<br /><br />The story itself was interesting - it's the future and women aren't able to conceive. Life, and the future, is bleak. This is all good stuff and I loved how the movie started out by tossing us right into this world without a safety net and we learned everything as we went along on our hero's journey. Unfortunately, the story was pretty much all over the place too much of the time and there were enough events in the movie that didn't make sense to me to take me out of the story and back into my head. Five writers wrote the screenplay and it shows and at times I was left wondering if they weren't all playing a game of \\"Telephone\\" where one writer leaves the plot for another writer to pick up on and continue.<br /><br />Clive Owen and Michael Caine both turn in excellent performances, but those performances alone couldn't save Children of Men for me. I would never tell anyone not to watch this movie, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.

If all dogs could tell a story like this one, the world would be in for delicious (dog) treats!<br />I saved this book to read during the \\"sea days\\" of my cruise. Unfortunately, I was unable to savor it for more than one day...I just could not put it down, I even read during the (endless) meals. Embarrassed, at times, by the tears creeping down my cheeks, I advise you to keep a supply of tissues at hand.<br /><br />This was a wonderful read and a highlight of my vacation...Enjoy!

B000SGGUWS|5.0|This is a book that once you start reading, you can't stop reading. Also, this book will make you want to read the whole series. I recomend that you read the series before you see the episodes. Read!!!
B001G0LBZ6|5.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE this soundtrack! Totally worth what I paid for it! I am a H-U-G-E Juno fan, so this was like icing on the cake for me! I highly recommend it to all other Juno fans.
067144901X|5.0|We received this book as a gift when my daughter was born. We started reading it to her at a few weeks of age and she has always seemed to enjoy it. When she was really little I would sit her up on the boppy and have her track the pictures in the book. As she got older we would use it to teach her the sounds of each animal. She's now 18 months and she still LOVES it! She requests to read it at least once a day, but now we don't even have to ask her what each animal says - she just screams out \\"MOO\\" or \\"BAA\\" when she knows she's supposed to! One of my favorite things about this book is that the pictures are simple - not too busy - which makes the book ideal for small children! Enjoy!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|This is far better than the shopaholic!  And that's a favorite.  I honestly was a little unsure about a book based around a ghost, but this is unlike any ghost story ever.  It's completely charming with mystery and intrigue tom go with all the comedy.  And she entwined it all well. It's a must read for chick lit lovers!
B000024E9F|4.0|The first album from Genesis into the 70s; Not the Genesis everyone knows but one of the first groups of genesis. Of course including Peter Gabriel on lead vocals and Flute, Michael rutherford on bass and some acoustic guitars, and Tony banks on Piano and organ. Than two others that was in just for this album than left the group was Anthony Phillips on Lead Guitar and John Mayhew on drums, percussion. To me, this is a slow album but a very good one at that! These songs (and other Genesis songs with Peter Gabriel) takes you on mystical journeys to places I can even even be beginning to understand it all but I love that way it makes me feel when listening to it! This album is the first of their real creativity to put into sound and record. Starting out with Looking For Someone you get a nice long song you can easily get into than into the second song White Mountain (alot of their songs were long, about 7 minutes) telling a tale about a wolf name Fang into this big epic adventure! Also with awesome music from Genesis in the background! The track Stagnation is another long slow song but to me one of my favorites on this album. I can listen to it all the way to the end and not get bored at all. The whole song is so beautiful and Peter Gabriels voice singing it is so different and fits perfectly with the music. Than you come to the end with the mighty Knife! Defiantly my favorite track on the album. Finally a fast tempo on the album and not just that but a total War anthem for me! \\"For those that trespass again us.\\" Such hardcore work for me and such genius' in my eyes. This one is a must have for anyone getting into Genesis, it defiantly is apart of their history I mean they would rock concert halls with The Knife!     Must Have!!!
0743289692|5.0|I just finished this book today. I was really blown away at how she relates her experiences without seeming angry or bitter. Rather, she feels very lucky to be alive and using her voice to bring attention to the rampant oppression of women that Islam perpetuates across the world.
030746363X|5.0|There are many complimentary things could be said about Tim Ferriss and his work, but the long list would bore you and wouldn't fit on one page!     4HB is an excellent example of Tim's outside-the-box views on everything. It is an easy read, not only massively informative but also entertaining. This is a self-help book unlike any other, full of honest, legit tips and regimens applicable to almost anybody. Well worth buying.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|For a twihard this is great. It just would have been more great had Taylor Lautner been included in the commentary with Kristen Stewart and Robert Pattinson.
B0027HOBM2|5.0|Perhaps you already know that Mad Men is about advertising men in the 1960s.  It's specifically about the story of Don Draper, the man with a secret past.  One thing that seems to get lost in the accounts of the plot of this series is how much it focuses on the role of women, how they were treated, and what their personal view of themselves was during this time just before the age of the women's liberation movement.    This season focuses on the dynamic of Duck joining the Sterling Cooper team as Head of Accounts and the dynamic between him and Don Draper.  Don begins a new affair with the wife of a famous comedian and Betty grows suspicious of the pair.  The season climaxes with Don's old LA ties and big changes afoot for the executives at Sterling Cooper.  Things are not the same after this season.    If you enjoy well acted dramas, period pieces, and shows having to do with business I would highly recommend Mad Men all seasons.  You'll probably love it.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Think MASTERPIECE THEATER meets MERCHANT IVORY.  That is the quality-level of The King's Speech.<br /><br />Rarely has there ever been a movie where every scene, every role, each word is nothing short of perfection.<br /><br />The acting by the leads is nothing short of masterful. Colin Firth has such control over the emotional roller coast ride that he brings the future king to life on multiple levels: you see George (\\"Bertie\\") as both a human being afflicted with ghosts from a dysfunctional early life and a powerful force that is to be dealt with accordingly. Matching him is Geoffrey Rush as speech therapist Lionel Logue.  Mr. Rush, under the skillful hand of director Tom Hooper, underplays a part that is quite easy to overblow.  With patience, frustration, humanity and a steel rod spine of determination, he is both the devil and the angel sitting on the future King's shoulders. With a casual elegance that is part Noel Coward, part Laurence Olivier, Mr. Rush covers areas from therapy to slapstick with a calculated ease that is breath taking. Keeping up in the acting race is Helena Bonham Carter - a woman who has obvious talent but is prone, at times, to select roles that are more of an oddity rather than a challenge for her considerable skills.  Here, however, Ms. Carter flourishes in the role of the future Queen Mother. Her Elizabeth is both warm and determined. In her eyes you see the power that is capable of holding a nation together. Her Elizabeth is elegant but never stuffy - she obviously researched both the person she is portraying as well as the challenges that must have faced the real life Elizabeth.<br /><br />As good as the acting is with these three (and it is very, very good), The King's Speech is still an ensemble piece. No role (from Derek Jacobi's Archbishop down to the young Queen Elizabeth and Princess Margaret) is less than perfectly executed.<br /><br />The King's Speech, especially with the trouble brewing overseas today, is a timely reminder of the need for quality and leadership.dership.
B003Q6D2B4|2.0|This movie features a wonderful cast of actors and a first-rate production, but cannot decide if it is a comedy or thriller or something else.  It wavers between very slow paced dialogue and extremely fast paced action and explosive violence.  Sometimes amusing and sometimes gripping as drama.  But, it strays beyond the line of acceptability when the main character sways like a pendulum between sympathetic, invincible hero and cold-blooded, vengeful reactionary.  Also, it goes beyond the implausible to the ridiculous in several places.
1439110123|5.0|The book is full of interesting connections between petroleum and history, but is a substantial book.  The Audible audiobook is a joke with less than three hours for a book that would be tens of hours if actually narrated.
B000065AI3|5.0|Great Album, happy my mother made me listen to this stuff growing up! now my 3yr old lil girl sings the songs with me!  Fooled again is my favorite TP song along with breakdown. great stuff, Tom might be the greatest song writer ever!
B000I5X81K|5.0|I went to visit a friend one day, and while waiting for her to answer the door, this incredible sound from inside her home greeted my ears.  Ever since, I have been buying Josh Grobin cd's.  Beautiful, beautiful, inspirational music.
0307454541|1.0|PLEASE do not buy this book. Mr. Larsson goes to great and quite boring lengths to describe even the most minute and uninteresting of details over the first half of the book. I continued reading in the hope that it would get more interesting, but even though the story finally progressed, it was as ultimately boring and uneventful as both main characters. If you want to get a glimpse at the length and depth of the book, go watch the movie. At least you are just wasting 3 hours rather than many more on this book. Do not buy this book.
B00005YW4H|5.0|What a lovely voice.  I was hooked the first time I heard her sing.  This is a replacement cd, as I literally wore out the first one I bought.
0312600844|5.0|Fiction occupies a special place in American culture.  At its best, fiction holds a mirror up to us.  It tells a story that has relevance to who we are and where we want to go.  It delves deeply into our differences and our behavior.  Jonathan Franzen's Freedom does all of these things and more.  I have never read anything by this marvelous story teller, now in his mid-career, so I had no preconceptions of how he tells a story.  He tackles a huge subject -- the use and misuse of freedom in our society.  He shows us how freedom can be used to improve and how freedom can be misused to destroy.  This is an involved story with many, many characters who come and go throughout the 560 pages of this book.  In places, one feels that the Mr. Franzen has read a bit too much Tolstoy or George Eliot.  There are places in Freedom where I felt that the story was veering into different directions, only to see that the author shifted gears and knew exactly where he wanted to take us.      The plot is complicated.  Patty and Walter Berglund live a prosaic and disappointing life in St Paul, Minnesota.  They raise two children.  The older of the two, Jessica, is somewhat formless but her younger brother, Joey, is fiercely independent, opinionated, confrontational, and extremely emotionally secure.  In fact, he moves out of his parents' house to live with a family next door.  One of the attractions of the next-door family is the daughter of the house, Connie.  The story moves in various directions until the main event emerges about one-third through the book.  Patty, after more than twenty years of marriage to a going nowhere Walter, has a fling with Walter's best friend, a rock musician named Richard.  Walter discovers the affair by reading Patty's carelessly tended diary and moves out.  Walter begins to rediscover himself by attaching to an environmental group that is protecting the habitat of a rare bird.  The habitat, insanely enough, is planned to be on the top of a remote West Virginia mountain that is in the process of being strip mined for coal.  The points of view of the bird activists and the coal company that proposes to level an entire mountain top come in to sharp conflict.  Walter's life takes a sharp turn when he falls in love with his exotic assistant, who is eventually killed in a freak car accident on one of the mountain passes.  Walter and Patty, each having been roughly treated by life, are reunited late in the book in a beautiful scene at a remote lakeside cottage.      So, we read about choices made and the necessity to maintain sanity and spirit through all of the vast demands of living a useful and happy life.  This all bears on the questions of liberty and freedom, ethics and morality.  It is a large subject and very difficult to place in the context of what America has gone through over the last decade.  Our war in the Middle East, economic stress, corrupt corporations, divisive politics, and ungovernable youth are themes that Franzen tackles head-on.  They all play a part in forming the context of the debate the country is having over how much freedom our citizens can handle.      Freedom is a tough book in many ways since it deals with the big issues of public and private lives.  But Jonathan Franzen tells his story so well, with such a superb ear for dialogue and characterization, that we are brought along to confront very big issues with a sense of irony and wit.  He succeeds brilliantly in telling his story, which is far more than plotting and character development.

1582701709|4.0|Hi all  When i first ordered the book i thought what can it teach me, well i can tell you it makes you rethink your thinking, if this makes sense. Whilst reading the Secret it really made me look at my life & why things panned out the way they did & some of what i read made alot of sense as it related to issues of my past, yes my past. I'm learning new ways of thinking to get all i want out of my life & to start been more positive than before.     I am currently doing some deep thinking & asking for what i want, as of yet nothing has happened but i will stay positive & believe that it will happen, it's only been two weeks but i just started the process this week & know i have to continue to believe.

0823015033|5.0|This book blew me away when I opened it. The book lives up to it's title and exceeded my expectations by covering all the basics of how to work with polymer clay, the different kinds of clay, how to make your own tools, what tools to buy, etc. It is easy to read with clear, full-color photographs of every single tiny step.

1600108512|5.0|I knew it would be a good comic, but I didn't expect it sooooo beautiful. It's incredible, what a good work. A fantastic edition, perfect for collectors. I'm not a big comic fan but this graphic novel is more than words can describe. It's amazing.     The quality of the cover, the paper, the colours, everything is so accurate, so lovely worked... And it's lovely to see the extra pages with drawings and interviews.     I LOVE IT!
B0002KZAKS|4.0|Bought this one after reading article at [...]    For a price, it is not bad.     pros: Cheap,         Sound signal is loud,        Low frequencies are loud,        Built pretty sturdy,        Comes in a nice box    cons: little boomy        One I got was black as well.    Few beatboxers visiting our studio really liked the product.
B000HIVO64|5.0|Well if it came out in '06, then I've been listening to 'The Information' for five years now and it is just a great, if lesser known, Beck work.  Coming out at around the same time as 'Guero,' it marks a very productive period for Mr. Beck.  The accompanying DVD is weird, but doesn't detract from enjoying the CD separately.  I put the DVD in, never watched it again, have probably lost it, and don't care.  Listen for the glottal stops in 'Cellphone's Dead,' it's !Khoisan click speech, and the information just keeps on coming at a thousand beats per minute.  Beck continues to evolve, he's a soulful, techno, rappish hipster spouting psychohypnotique metalyrics.
B000001EHS|5.0|I've been a Def Leppard fan for a long time and I love every song on this album.  It's a good selection of some of their best.
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|I ordered this album before I saw the movie. Originally I only played a few tracks \\"Express\\" & \\"Show Me How You Burlesque\\". Now that I've seen (& enjoyed) the movie I play the whole album on REPEAT. I purchased Cher's #1 club hit \\"You Haven't Seen The Last Of Me\\" The Remixes From Burlesque (Radio Edits) to replace the original and it fits the album perfectly. (Upbeat) This album deserves a place in your collection! If you're a fan of \\"Moulin Rouge\\", \\"Chicago\\"&/or \\"Coyote Ugly\\" I highly recommend it!
B000F8DB4O|5.0|All I have to say is that I'm on my 3rd or 4th CD because each one I've gotten I've worn out!  This CD is classic and gets me through the day, it stays loaded in my disc changer in the car.

Then people will know to get out of my way and save me so much time.  I also wish it plays when driving in traffic so I could pass slow driver. The movie is good. It is about musical shark.
B004HU6YZ4|5.0|After having this album in heavy rotation for the last couple weeks in my car, I will say that it is one of those albums that takes time to appreciate, and one that I am enjoying more and more each time I hear it. At first, like many reviewers, I was disappointed that the songs as a whole were much slower and less \\"punk\\" than previous albums, but that doesn't make the songs any less enjoyable to listen to. I love Mike's guitar solos, and the guitar work on these songs is great. I will keep hoping for a new release in the future with faster songs like my favorite \\"Don't Drag Me Down\\", but for now I'm enjoying these slower songs similar to another favorite \\"Footsteps on my Ceiling\\".
0670022411|3.0|This is a frustrating read.  the author introduces a new twist on an old theme, with the premise of four species co-existing: humans, daemons, vampires and witches, and the history of each. However, each major plot point is introduced and then never developed, such as the backstory of Diana's parents. The gathering war clouds of a battle between the three creature species is never really explained, rather the author adds new elements to the reason for the war.  Nothing is ever resolved, by the final chapters the storytelling is just hitting stride and the book is coming to an end.  The book  had great potential, but it should have been edited to half it's length and the rest of the story played out.  At the end you realize it's just another \\"mystery-romance-time traveller tale\\".  it's clear the ending demands a sequel, but the author is not on the level of Diana Gabaldon, and shouldn't be going in that direction.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I'm very happy with these headphones but they are a bit tight.  I do have a large head (24 inch circumference).  The padding is OK but they do not leave lots of room inside for ears.  The sound is fine, there's plenty of deep bass, they don't need to be driven very hard.  But if you're sensitive to tight headphones as I've always been, you might want to consider something else. What - I don't know. I searched a lot for something in this price range that seemed like it might be comfortable
B003XCVQ3C|4.0|this works well. i am not sure if the audio is 5.1 digital, or just two channel. one must go into monitor preferences to set up output display to mirror or not and HDMI. one must also go into sound preferences and set that to HDMI. i think a lot of people just plug it in an expect it to work, when that is not the case. once this is done, everything should be fine.
B00328G4V6|4.0|I need to correct what seems to be a frequently made observation in these reviews. Contrary to what many seem to be saying, this is NOT what was to be what Jimi was working on as a follow-up to Elecric Ladyland. The closest thing ever to be released, that Jimi has said he was working on as his follow-up to EL, was First Rays of the New Rising Sun. This was what Jimi wanted the title to be and he intended for it to be a 2 record set like EL was. No-one can be 100% sure of what the final song list was to be, but according to many of Jimi's notes, many of the songs that WOULD have been on it are those that were released by his family in 1997, under the same name (FROTNRS). Some of the confusion seems to be the result of notes included with VON, regarding when the recordings on VON were made (after EL), with the observation that they would have been what constitutes a follow-up. To clarify this, however   -   some of these where indeed recorded when other songs slated for FROTNRS were, and some might have been on the final album, but the closest thing that is out there   -  the closest thing to what Jimi had in mind for his follow-up   -   is First Rays of the New Rising Sun, as released by Hendrix's family in 1997.
B004FOJZXU|1.0|this is a pretty awesome product . . . . if you live in the uk that is. if you live in north America its a freaking rip off. you cant download the digital copy through tunes, and the dvd doesn't work on any American dvd players or other players such as computers or game consoles. in short don't waste your money on this if you live in America.
0316098337|4.0|I was hooked on the voice of Jack, as most readers were or will be. And the details perceived by him, and his way of perceiving them. But Ms. Donoghue was asking a lot, and in the end it was too heavy a burden to carry the entire narrative on his five-year old back. It didn't help that Jack was constantly \\"getting some,\\"as the author referred to his suckling of Ma's left or right breast. Her strongest passages, I thought, were those linked so vividly to scene and the feeling of what it was like to live in Room from one day the next. All of this energized by the games they played, the TV shows they watched, the skylight and its wondrous view of \\"Outside.\\" This \\"Inside\\" world with its Rug and Wardrobe and Door all a stage of the quietly alluded to horror of Old Bill's presence. There is also drama in the second half, but after the build up to the first, it felt a bit anticlimactic. There could have been more, and for those who haven't read it I'll say only that it relates to Old Bill.<br />A memorable story, and character, this little boy, brave, of course, but also selfish enough to be real.
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Need I say more. A great movie that takes you in the formation of Facebook. Some of the facts aren't accurate but the big picture tells an amazing story with a great musical score behind it. Codo's to the screenwriter and a great cast.
B0041KKYEM|3.0|This film would appear to be based on mental illness. A disease that most of the times goes untreated and ignored until it is too late. In this story we meet Nina Sayers (Natalie Portman). She has been working very hard at becoming the prima ballerina in her New York City Ballet company.<br /><br />However, underneath that determined facade, there is a load of guilt placed there by her mother, who gave up such an opportunity in order to give birth to Nina. A side spin off of her mother's over-controlling ways is that Nina has become sexually repressed, and is not in touch with her sexuality, neither has she fully come to terms with being a young adult female. As a result, she is innocently led into some sexual experiences.<br /><br />The main concept in this movie is that it attempts to deal with parallels and opposites:<br /><br />[1] In the Ballet production, there is the White swan and the Black Swan, which for this production must both be played by Nina.<br /><br />[2] In her personal life, she begins also to display a split personality, and at times it would appear that she deliberately cuts herself. In her \\"white\\" personality, she is a virgin, and does everything to please and obey her mother, on the other hand, her \\"black\\" personality is defiant, and is sexually promiscuous.<br /><br />The bottom line is that Nina, is in desperate need of help. Everyone else seems just too busy with their own ambitions and personal goals to really notice. She is haunted by visions of her very own self. A self that is tired of all the rules and tired of all the pressure.<br /><br />The big question is, who will really win: Nina or the phantom of herself that haunts her?<br /><br />2011 Best Actress Nominee:<br /><br />It should be noted that Natalie Portman has been nominated by the Academy Awards for Best Actress because of this role. Her role was quite demanding, physically in terms of the dancing involved, emotionally in terms of duality of the roles that she had to play, and then there was the simulated sexual content (which I personally did not care for).rsonally did not care for).
1595141715|5.0|I'd heard an abundant amount of good things about this book so I decided to give it a try. From the moment I picked it up I could hardly put it back down. It starts off with the main character Clay Jensen arriving at his house and he sees this box on his front porch with his name on it. Strangely enough, the box is full of cassette tapes. As Clay listens to each tape, I felt the emotion that he was feeling. Hannah Baker was one of his classmates that committed suicide 2 weeks before and these tapes were hers. She explains that there are 13 reasons why she committed suicide and if you received the tapes then you were one of the reasons why. This book goes to show what rumors, lies, bullying, and hatred can do to someone. It also shows how one person can affect another person's life, in this case negatively. This book gets very emotional and I had to take the time to stop and reflect on what I read so I fully understood what emotion each character was feeling. This is truly a great read for any teen. It is powerful, suspenseful, and unforgettable.
1439152780|5.0|I think Kate Morton is a first class author and I zipped through her other books = BUT --- this one was tedious.  It took me longer to read but I still found it quite enjoyable.

B004DF3S7A|1.0|I suspect that folks who buy this stuff are unfamiliar with the \\"Great American Songbook\\" and when they hear one of these timeless songs they enjoy it so much they rush out to buy Rod's version.  He has chosen some beautiful classics to record.  Really though, you should look for these songs as performed by great Jazz artists like Diana Krall, Frank Sinatra, Chet Baker, Eileen Farrell, Bill Charlap, Stan Getz, Tony Bennett, Ben Webster or Billie Holiday.  You would be amazed at how great these songs are when performed by someone with the musical ability to provide a valid interpretation.  Rod must be laughing all the way to the bank!  His rock and roll material is awesome-no question. But he has neither the talent nor the skill to successfully interpret this material.  His croaking efforts make me cringe!!!!  Perhaps Kermit should consider recording some romantic songbook material?<br /><br />I just hope other aging rockers don't decide to cash in and emulate Rod. Can you imagine Robert Plant warbling \\"Stairway to the Stars\\"? Or Mick Jagger growling \\"You'd Be So Nice To Come Home To\\"?  If Jim Morrison were still around, I guess I wouldn't mind hearing his version of \\"Sleep Warm\\".  After all, he was a serious fan of Frank Sinatra and had the chops to successfully mimic some elements of Frank's style in some of his better love songs!<br /><br />One rock artist who can turn in credible interpretations of this type of music is Brian Ferry. Check out his \\"As Time Goes By\\" CD. As Time Goes By
0793518326|5.0|I really don't get all the complaints about the small print.  If it was any bigger, the book would be 5,000 pages long.  And i find the having to turn pages for the whole song thing irrelevant.  Who would actually try to read this while playing a gig?  You use the book to listen along and learn the parts by heart, then play it for other people after you have it in your muscle memory, right? Well, that's what i need it for, and for songs with outrageous chords (like It Won't Be Long)I've never found a more accurate or helpful Beatles songbook.  Wish this came out when I was 13 and just starting guitar, I would have improved exponentially a whole lot faster!
B004856SQ8|5.0|This movie is action packed starting from the beginning. I did not see it in theaters and was pleasantly surprised when I finally got to see it. Blu-ray transfer is as great as ever.
B004856SQ8|5.0|Besides a few technical errors, like Ranger's are not the same as Special Forces, A 4 man team would not be an A-team but this is TV. Also Murdock never sat in the van, like the box cover.BA has no gold nor would a man in hiding on the run. He made BA his own, not Mr. T. Now that I am done complaining this was a great movie, a but more adult than the TV show but not over the top with language or violence. At least not being the A-team.     Now the sad part is we have to wait a couple years for the next one. I never thought anyone could pull off Hannibal but Qui-Gon Jinn pulled it off. I always thought he was too thin and kind of sickly looking but he fit the role. Face was good, except not the player as on the TV show, but still the conman.    Now I have to watch the TV show again to get my A-team fix.
0811876373|5.0|Great Book, great pictures, I had no trouble with the instructions.  Yes, most of these are on her blog, for free, but having everything in one place, and in a spiral book, to take with you is so much more convenient then having to go back and forth from computer to kitchen, or taking your laptop into the kitchen, which in my case is dangerous.  I'm glad I made the investment in this book.  Also I teach cake decorating, so being able to recommend and take this to class is a big help.  The only thing I would change is quite possibly more kitchen friendly paper, maybe laminated!!!  But that's just me, the messier the kitchen, the sexier the cook!
0440245931|4.0|Mr Grisham is a master of twisted plots and wickedly sarcastic dialog. This book is packed full of it, and this is what keeps the rather dense prose moving along at a swift pace. Not all characters are given the same attention, the secondary ones are rather flimsy, but the main one, Darby, is interesting. She starts out as an ambitious law student, and develops into a street-smart yet scared fugitive, who struggles to stay alive.     The crime motives and the perpetrator's identity are revealed rather early on, but the link between the crime and the perpetrator are cleverly kept to the last few pages, and helps explain the audacity of the criminal, who believed that he can never be linked to the crime. This is what makes the plot work, and the story hinges on it. However, this is not a mystery in a traditional sense.    The other interesting character, who comes in around the middle of the book, and is critical to the plot, code-named Garcia, is a conflicted individual. He is torn between the need to reveal what he knows about the crime, and his fear for himself and his family. A very well-realized character, in my opinion.    The writing style is a bit flat, if we don't count the sizzling dialogue, and is not as strong as in the other Grisham novels I have read. This is why I am giving the book a 4 rather than 5. Still, a highly enjoyable read, and a potential candidate for a re-read.     By the way, if you plan to watch the film based on the book, be warned that it's not nearly as good as the book, so perhaps it should be watched before reading. The book will help clarify the plot, which is very hard to follow in the movie. Julia Roberts does a great job as Darby.
0545123275|5.0|Grace was savaged by a pack of wolves when she was a child, yet she isn't afraid of them. She finds herself particularly drawn to a yellow-eyed wolf and spends all her extra time watching him in the woods behind her house. Unknown to Grace, that yellow-eyed wolf is actually a werewolf named Sam. He's watched her from a distance all these years since he only gets short periods to be human during very warm times. However once they finally meet while they are both humans, their feelings cannot be put back in the box. With a love doomed from the start, they know they are in for one heck of a fight to keep each other, as the cold and the future's uncertainty are looming over their heads.<br /><br />This romance between Grace and Sam was absolutely beautiful! It was so heartfelt and sweet, making it probably the most enjoyable relationship to read about in any YA book that I have ever read. While they definitely had a physical attraction to each other, their relationship was so much more than that. It just felt natural, like they were truly meant to be together. It actually is amazing that they were even able to develop such a strong bond together at all considering the circumstances. I really hope they are able to stay strong in the future, no matter the obstacles that may try to come between them.<br /><br />While this book is technically a YA paranormal romance, the characters really aren't paranormal in the strictest sense. When the werewolves shift into wolves, they do not retain their human minds as in most other books. For all intents and purposes, they are just regular wolves. In fact, once they make the final transition to complete wolf, they only live the live span of a normal wolf, about ten to fifteen years. The only thing that makes them paranormal at all is that they spend some time as human, and they heal faster than normal. I found this to be a really interesting take on the \\"werewolf\\" aspect, making it seem more like an accident of science than mystical or magical.<br /><br />This book kept me up into the wee hours of the morning as I made the mistake of starting it right before I went to bed. I just simply could not put it down. The ending almost seemed to stop mid-stride, but still left me with a sense of happiness and satisfaction. I'm extremely glad I already have the sequel so I won't have to wait. However, if it is even half as good as Shiver was, then I have a feeling the wait for the final book will be agonizing. If you enjoy a good love story mixed in with a little conflict, then Shiver is definitely the book for you.his book kept me up into the wee hours of the morning as I made the mistake of starting it right before I went to bed.

B004HW7JMY|4.0|At first I thought that it might be difficult to write about Spartacus: Gods of the Arena without revealing major spoilers to the Spartacus: Blood & Sand series that Gods is a prequel to. But then the first episode of Gods aired and, lo and behold, the ending scene of the first series is the opening scene of the prequel.<br /><br />Now in my opinion that wasn't a very smart thing to do. After all, it basically assumes that there will be no newcomers to the series, right? I mean what if you were new to the series, you watched the prequel and were drawn into Blood & Sand only to now know the fate of the main characters of Blood and Sand that took 13 episodes to reveal with one of the best and most memorable season finales that I've ever seen?!?<br /><br />I don't know, but I think that's kinda sucky.<br /><br />Well, spoilers aside, Gods of the Arena is excellent. Gods chronicles the bloody and lewd days of the House of Batiatus prior to the arrival of Spartacus. It introduces us to Gannicus, one of Capua's initial champion warriors; it delivers Crixus to the scene and it documents the rise of Oenomaus to Doctore. But something is missing....Ah...what's missing is the item that made Blood & Sand a 5-Star series; what's missing is Andy Whitfield and his Spartacus character.<br /><br />Nevertheless, Starz has presented fans of Blood & Sand and newcomers to the series with a welcome gift with Gods of the Arena. John Hannah as Batiatus and Lucy Lawless as his wife Lucretia get a chance to reprise the roles that they excellently portrayed in Blood & Sand, and they again portray the roles with passion.<br /><br />If you were a fan of Blood & Sand and you're not watching Gods of the Arena, you're cheating yourself out of a show that's almost as good as the original. And if you're new to the show, I recommend watching [[ASIN:B003PIUC02 Blood & Sand]] first, then viewing Gods of the Arena so that the spoiler factor is erased.<br /><br />Don't miss this excellent show.<br /><br />Side note: Well wishes to Whitfield on a speedy recovery to his cancer which is why Gods of the Arena even exists. The prequel was initially formulated to hold fans over during Whitfield's recovery. But Starz recently announced that the role of Spartacus would need to be replaced (by Larry McIntyre) due to complications in Whitfield's  recovery.

B003AYDPYQ|3.0|First off this show is freaking awesome!  with that said,  This is my first video purchase on amazon. In a desperate attempt to escape the high prices of iTunes I tried a new vendor. My experience was subpar. My specifications of my home computer are that of a high end system and my internet connection is eighteen megabytes down over a cable connection. I experienced repeated stop and buffer moments and browser crashes. I also paid a higher price for a high definition video. My television supports a refresh rate of 120 hertz and this products quality was best related to that of a standard DVD format and sometimes pixilated like a ripped MP4.   Overall I am unsatisfied with my purchase. I believe my system supports all the necessary requirements to support high def streaming as I currently have no problems with high def from Netflix. I think it is unfair to charge a higher price for a higher definition video when the current software cannot deliver consistent quality.   Add On Friday, Dec 9:  I thought I had edited this before but I guess I never submitted. I just want to say that when I had posted this negative comment amazon customer service reach out to me a day later, without me asking, and offered a refund. I plan to continue shopping from amazon for anything I can! In a world of terrible customer service, amazon has treated me better then the rest.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Black Swan's premise originally seems simple; the cutthroat world of ballet in the perspective a talented, but insecure student. Natalie Porman plays Nina, the dancer who seems to be falling apart from the beginning of the film. After about the half-hour mark the movie becomes an intense thriller with many complex ideals.    Lets start with the performances. Everyone in this film is cast perfectly, too the point where you can't find a weak person in the group. Barbara Hershey gives a creepy performance as Nina's controlling mother and also delivers some of the films funnier moments (which is nice in such a dark film). Mila Kunis also gives a career making performance as Lily, the dancer that embodies everything Portman's Nina lacks. Of course the biggest buzz for this film was Portman's performance, which was nearly flawless which could have come off as really disjointed (we'll get to it).    The reason that the performances are so great is because the writing in this film really isn't the best, some of the lines sounded way to dramatic to ever be real, but the cast completely pulls each line off and makes the movie seem seamless.    I'll leave out my theory of what this film is about, but it does have a lot to do with the implications that societies expectations of women. If you enjoy smart films, with brilliant performances this is definitely for you.

For the few hours it took to finish the book I was totally absorbed in other points of view, other perspectives and problems. The author wonderfully brought out how difficult it really is to be human. Since the book is so short, giving anything away about the plot is to give too much away.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have never been an athletic person, always hated gym glass and working out.  I needed to get into shape to wear a very form fitting costume for a party.  My sister recommended this dvd to me.  I liked the idea of a 20 minute workout--I hadn't worked out regularly in about 4 years.  And to be honest, I'm lazy.  I did it for 30 days straight and stopped eating junk food,  and no more fast food trips.   It really worked.  I lost about 10 lbs and really firmed up.  I was definitely \\"skinny fat\\" before, but not any more.  I liked the results so much that I have kept it up so far for about 5 months, alternating with her No More Trouble Zones about 2-3 times a week (purchased that after I was doing this one for about 2 months).  I might take 1-2 days off of working out depending on my schedule, but I always seem to be able to convince myself to squeeze this one in, since it is only 27 minutes total (warm up to cool down).   I have never been firmer in my life, thanks to Jillian.  I am not following a special diet, just trying to be reasonable and not eat so much junk and not an entire half of a large pizza in one sitting.  I like her style, she doesn't annoy me at all.  Yes, sometimes I swear at her, but that is because some of the moves are still hard!  I'm wondering if I will ever be able to breeze through it--and if so,  I can always start using heavier weights.  I used to be the laziest exerciser in the world, used to lollygag around on the elliptical and try to do some free weight exercises.  I also hate the gym.  This works for me because she keeps you going, you see results and you don't have to go anywhere.  It's only 10 bucks, you can not lose--give it a try!

B004DMIIOG|5.0|Or is it the other way around?<br /><br />Reminiscent of American movies like \\"War Games,\\" as well as anime greats like \\"Spirited Away,\\" this movie blends suspense, comedy, family, and a touch of romance in an expert mixture that is fun and heartwarming.<br /><br />Kenji is a math genius with no self-confidence and, in his opinion, nothing else he is good at, especially when it comes to the fairer sex. He is spending his summer break working in tech support for the mega-giant, all pervading social networking site Oz when the girl of his dreams, the popular upperclassmen Natsuki, asks if he can work for her over the summer. The job is simple, she says. He just needs to accompany her on a trip to her Grandmother's house for a family reunion and do whatever odd jobs are needed to help out her big family. When it turns out that the real job is to pretend to be her fianc&eacute;, he balks at first. After all, he has never even taken a girl on a date, let alone gotten serious enough to be engaged! (My perception is that he was thinking that he can't pretend to be in love with someone that he has loved from afar for years!) But he agrees to go along with the ruse with some gentle pleading by the pretty Natsuki. When an AI cyber-terrorist attacks Oz using Kenji's avatar, most everything hits the fan. But Natsuki's large, eccentric family mobilizes, with inspiration from the matriarch and an extra push from Kenji himself, and works to counter this threat to the world, since much of the real world's infrastructure is routed through Oz, and Oz is being eaten by the AI. Can a math geek, a middle school fighting game expert, and a beautiful, self confident young woman save the world? Watch this masterpiece by Mamoru Hosoda, the director of the stunning \\"The Girl Who Leapt Through Time,\\" and find the answer.<br /><br />The BluRay is well presented, with easy to use menus and stunning graphics. The background art, both in and out of Oz, is breathtaking art in it own right. The character designs in the real world are natural and effective. The Oz avatars are cute, but have amazing capacity for creepiness and emotional expression. The English dub cast, comprised of veteran voice actors like Brina Palencia, Michael Sinternicklaas, Todd Haberkorn, and J. Michael Tatum, do a fantastic job of bringing the characters to life. Many big name anime films use big name actors instead of professional voice actors, and the dubs frequently suffer because of it. \\"Summer Wars\\" does not fall into that trap. The dub script is well wrought, with extremely natural turns of phrase and an excellent \\"lip flap\\" match, so much so that it is hard to tell that it isn't the original language of the film. There were a few spots were on-screen kanji were not translated that would have been helpful, but other than that, the localization is extremely well done.<br /><br />In short, I highly recommend this film to young and old, anime fans or not!

B0018M6J90|5.0|Set in London just before Britain entered the second World War, Miss Pettigrew Lives For A Day creates just the right combination of apprehension for the future and delight in the frivolities of today. After being fired again from a governess position, Miss Pettigrew (Frances McDormand) pilfers a business card from her employment agency. She then tries her hand as a social secretary for Miss Delysia Lafosse (Amy Adams), an American actress and singer. Miss Pettigrew finds herself in the glamorous whirl of the British upper class where her attempts to blend in only show how much she truly stands above the rest. As the day unfolds Miss Pettigrew attempts to help her new friend Delyssia navigate her love life and career, both complicated by three men vying for Delysia's attention: Michael, a penniless but enamored pianist; Nick, a wealthy night club owner; and Phil, a young up and coming impresario. Delysia and Ms. Pettigrew will find they each need the other to discover their own romantic destinies.
0307245306|3.0|This is a review for the audio performance of the book.<br /><br />The Percy Jackson series is an excellent series for introducing mythology to youth.  Five stars for the books themselves.  I purchased the audio book to go along with the book set that I use with my seventh graders, hoping to get a break from reading aloud to them.<br /><br />If you are only going to listen to this book once, and you are only going to listen to it, and not have the text in front of you, I'm sure it would be okay.<br /><br />But, as a teacher who has read the books before and who has four classes of students reading this book now, the audio recording drives me crazy.<br /><br />The actor's inflection is pretty terrible--to the point where I'm beginning to believe that he didn't read the book before he recorded it.  In places, he messes up and leaves out words (again, you wouldn't notice if you were just listening in your car).  His voice for Percy Jackson is pretty whiny all the time, even though Percy is a tough kid.  Where Annabeth is still usure about Percy and is guarded, the actor makes her voice sound cheery and friendly, which she is not at first.  He pays no heed to the narration around character dialogue.  Ancient Greek phrases that the characters use as curses come out sounding like incantations--the actor completely ignores the context.<br /><br />Again, the performance comes off as if he just picked up the book, started reading aloud, and recorded the first time through.  Who knows?  That may be what happened.<br /><br />If you are a teacher looking to purchase this CD set for your classroom, you've been warned.  It's going to drive you crazy to the point where you'll just want to read to your students yourself because you know you can do a better job.
B000NA28I4|2.0|I bought this movie for a few cents, solely for the purpose of enjoying the Rifftrax for it (which I highly recommend getting; it's hilarious). But I did end up watching it without the Rifftrax out of curiosity. While I was aware of what this movie was about prior to going into it, this is a review from the perspective of someone who has never read the books (and, quite frankly, has absolutely no interest in doing so).<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />-The scenery and cinematography are gorgeous, there's no denying that.<br />-The music's not half bad. Of course it's nowhere near good enough to me to warrant buying the soundtrack, and I guess it can be considered the kind of generic fantasy music that usually accompanies these movies, but compared to other things in this movie it's a good thing.<br />-The dragon's not half bad. Not necessarily the CGI, I mean more along the lines of the character of the dragon and even the voice.<br />-Jeremy Irons. 'Nough said.<br />-While I just couldn't care about Eragon, the idea of the relationship between him and his dragon was interesting to me (chalk it up to a childhood love of fantasy creatures). Too bad the kid was an annoyingly bland character.<br />-John Malkovich. No, not because he was good in this, but because he was so appallingly corny, so over the top melodramatic that I just couldn't stop laughing. Thank you, John Malkovich.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />-The characters are one-dimensional cardboard cutouts. I simply couldn't care about most of them or their problems. I mean, I liked Brom, but that was probably only because Jeremy Irons played him.<br />-Most of the actors aren't much better than the bland and boring characters.<br />-The plot is your usual paint-by-numbers fantasy story. That's not entirely a bad thing in some movies, but in this one, which sort of plodded along unsure and then kind of sputtered and flailed fantastically near the end, it's not a forgivable thing.<br />-Anything else not mentioned above.<br /><br />Oh, it was watchable for me without the Rifftrax, but only enough for one viewing; I don't think I could ever watch it again without the boys flaying it. The movie just isn't that interesting.
B0014DC0AK|5.0|Chuck Schuldiner is a man of legend within the underground and rightfully so. Few bands in any genre ever change and progress as much or, more importantly, as well as Death did over their career. With all the line-up changes, it's more apt to say Chuck himself evolved, not the band. Symbolic saw Death make a major shift towards progressive death metal and was only ever outdone by Death's last album \\"The Sound of Perserverance\\".<br /><br />This album, at the time(or even now), blew many away because it wasn't like Carcass or other \\"pure\\" death metal groups who did evolve but into something seemingly unrecognizable. Chuck's guitar-work became much more focused, well thought out, and direct and yet maintained his chaotic but melodic shredding style. From \\"Human\\" to \\"Individual Thought Patterns,\\" one was already getting the idea that Chuck wanted his form of death metal to enter a more melodic realm anyhow, but now it was never more apparent.<br /><br />The very first song, \\"Symbolic,\\" starts off with a riff that pretty much any budding guitarist could play once he/she learns a couple of chords, but it quickly enters much more progressive avenues of metal. The song shows off Chuck's flare for making song-oriented metal that has all the usual hooks that something played on the radio might have, but never sacrificing the actual songcraft for it. I don't know how he did it, but I suppose that is just his genius. He was a great song-writer, bottomline. Every song on this album gets progressively more technical but is always focused. They don't flay your face with blast beats or over-the-top riffs and guitar solos. \\"Without Judgement\\" has perhaps the best melodic interlude/solo section in a death metal song ever made. It is one of those rare moments like \\"Voice of the Soul\\" where you almost feel connected to Chuck through his playing. That was the kind of guitarist he was.<br /><br />Most of the album is just good old Chuck styled melodic-thrash meets technical death metal and offbeat time signatures. It's important to note that Gene Hoglan does probably the best work of his career on this album. He drives the music more than anyone on this album and it is with beats that most metal drummers these days still can't use nearly as effectivelly as he does. From rhythmic sections that glean of freeform jazz or even salsa time signatures, to straight-forward rock drumming made incredibly interesting by his constant desire to add splashes, crashes, and hi-hat fillers throughout, his work is my favirote part of the album. Richard Christy is the only other drummer(ironicly from Death's last album) is one of the only other drummers to use jazz/world styles of drumming to this effect in a death metal album. Drummers like Sean Reinhert(again from Death's \\"Human,\\" Cynic or a plethora of other great acts) are likewise amazing at this, but Hoglan was very showy on this album, but not to the point of making the music worse like Keith Moon or something. It's mind-blowing to me some of the beats he created and how organic they sound.<br /><br />Many sections of this album have brilliant melodic passages that outdo any band considering themselves \\"melodic death metal\\" and that is one of the key things that is so amazing about the album itself. Death metal is inherently *not* melodic. Chuck was one of the first to play death metal and he also didn't include melody in his work when he first started out. Death was no different from Carcass in that regard. But at this point in Death's career(and throughout the 90's) melody perhaps played the greater role in the music than the death metal. Generally you'd find that this would turn fans of \\"true\\" death metal away, but Chuck had an undeniable way of making it accessable to both people who prefer metal that is *only* melodic and people who prefer *only* death metal. He blends everything so you never even think about it being more part one than the other. His song-writing ability is second-to-none and it never shows more than on Symbolic. I don't think you'll ever find a death metal album with more memorable chorus' that actually stay in your head after only a couple of listens. And even years after I first fell in love with this cd, I still find myself astounded at the layers of sound that beg for your complete attention.<br /><br />I remember \\"Symbolic\\" and \\"Individual Thought Patterns\\" actually getting video playtime on MTV, they actually got to that level. Of course that was a time when headbangers ball was still around and you could even see At The Gates on there if you were lucky, but the point is he was transcending very stable musical boundaries with this record. At the very least, Chuck helped define an entire movement with this album and his last. \\"Symbolic\\" is perhaps his best work simply because it *is* the very symbol of the man's amazing, but short-lived musical career. Almost every underground band these days includes at least some degree of melody and accessable guitarwork for people and that is in large part due to albums such as this. \\"Symbolic\\" is concise, well-written metal that is aggressive, technical, melodic, and catchy and as well performed a death metal album as there has ever been. Few bands in the genre today try to build albums as perfectly as Chuck did, and succeed. This album is perhaps the best indicator of that point.k you'll ever find a death metal album with more memorable chorus' that actually stay in your head after only a couple of listens.

B001NEK2GE|3.0|I was very excited to use the G13, I have no problems with my keyboard but I was looking forward to the smaller form factor of this pad and the LCD.<br />It is very well built, and comfortable, but i find myself having to go back to my keyboard all the time.<br />The three main problems I see with this are:<br />1) LCD is not in front of you - I used to have a G15 gaming keyboard and the LCD was great, right in front of you displaying all kinds of info but this LCD is off to the side with your hand which makes it hard to read quickly while playing games.<br />2) Thumb space is not efficient at all. I'm used to having my thumb comfortably resting near my space bar for jumping, but with the G13 my thumb is in the un-used empty space between the joystick and a couple G buttons - none of which are inherently apparent to be \\"space\\".<br />3) no buttons for 1-6. If you're used to using WASD for controls, you're probably also used to using 1-6 for weapon selection. There are zero buttons above \\"WASD\\" on the G13, so you'll have to get used to something else (mouse wheel, mouse thumb buttons, etc) for weapon selection.<br /><br />In conclusion, I think logitech makes great products and has the right idea here, but it's just not practical for FPS games, better off just getting the G510.

Have a hard time believing it's based on a true story, though I am sure the author knows characters from India and has lived in Mumbai. Look at the acknowledgments at the end and see how few Indians from India there are in there. Also, things end up too neat.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|Growing up watching sci-fi there was always a sense of the scientific. That is to say a sense of discovery, and acknowledging that there was no symbiosis between what you thought was true, and what actually was true.  A good scientist did not fall in love with their theories, but defended what they believed to be true with no love for wanting their theory to triumph for the sake of it.  So it was with a lot of science fiction, including the original 1960's television show that I saw on both television and the big screen.    This rule applied specifically to science fiction. There was also a set of social standards in the application of science, and a set of codes that were likewise applicable when science was applied to mankind. This is part of the drama that science fiction presents to an audience.  Will our knowledge and intellectual capacity ever exceed our hearts, and if it does, what are the ramifications?  Up until \\"Star Trek; The Next Generation\\", the answer to that question was a resounding \\"no\\", followed by an explanation with the disaster that ensued.    But, with \\"The Next Generation\\" apparently the crew is always right, and apparently the interstellar therapists who cruise the space-ways of the 24th century are far beyond the primitive code of ethics for which their predecessors, Kirk, Spock, McCoy and company, stood for.     \\"Star Trek; the Next Generation\\" was and is, in this regard, fairly offensive.  Designed to ride the coat tails of the Star Trek franchise success created by the old familiar characters (who saw more fame and notoriety after the show was cancelled), this particular TV series twisted, dismissed, and otherwise contorted the values of just plain science fiction prior this show's inception.  Further, made no attempt to address the social corrections that the characters of Kirk and Spock stood for when they saw a situation that was very much amiss.    The values of respect for another way of life, no matter how perverted, took precedenton this newer show. Operating within the rules instead of acting on principle reigned supreme on \\"The Next Generation\\". If a child was kidnapped, then it was the children who had to decide whether he should go home or not, because hey, children are fully capable adult thinkers, right? If a strange alien form wiped out a civilization and only wanted to be left alone, then he deserved that solitude, right? If an all powerful sex-oriented civilization had death as the penalty for all wrongdoing, then it needed to go uncorrected, right? If Star Fleet itself were changed from a military organization with an exploratory and diplomatic function like sailing frigates of old, into some kind of utopia in space with families on board an armed vessel, then that was okay, right?     Wrong.     It was not okay. But millions, and I mean millions, of moronic Trek-fans, fans who only loved the fantasy of the spectacle, and did not think about what had been done to the history of the show, as well as the actual basis for the show itself, soaked it up like lemmings. And still do to this very day.     Don't get me wrong, there is some respectable drama in \\"The Next Generation\\", but it is so convoluted, so bent out of shape, so twisted with any real ethics coursing through societies, that one wonders just who the hell was in charge of this thing.     The truth is Rick Berman and Branon Braga were, and utterly destroyed the ethos of this once proud science fiction franchise, and laid down a what could be termed as \\"forced medication\\" for an audience that simply didn't know any better, and made no attempt to contemplate what it is that was being presented to them.    Don't believe me? Just read \\"Inside Star Trek; the Real Story\\" by Robert H. Justman and Herbert F. Solow, and discover how they and D.C. Fontanna and other vets of the 1960's show were muscled out in favor of a new creative team.  A team that favored a show that had not only some real social engineering aspects, but also a real disregard for anything that any science fiction show worth its salt, respected; truth.     How anyone, and I mean ANYONE, could embrace this thing as sterling entertainment is beyond me. One episode the ship and crew say than can't touch situation X, but in the next episode they completely reverse their position. If that isn't having a valueless piece of trash thrown on the small screen (and later big screen), then I don't know what is.    Then there's minutiae; like the trashing of the physicality of what was created before. Suddenly we don't have warp speed battles anymore because some well meaning idiot fan says that current physics states that nothing can travel faster than light, ergo no energy weapons at FTL speeds. Well, if that's the case, then how does warp drive work? Oh, that's different? How so? Then the Klingon and Romulan character social traits are reversed from what had been literally written in the shows bible, and written in the book on the making of Star Trek. And what used to take years in terms of reaching Star-A to Star-B in the older show can now be reached in a matter of hours? Huh?     It's garbage.     For all of the high-IQs focused on this show, one wonders how it is that no one other than myself, has made these observations. How is it that these fanatics give this show a pass for all of its faults? I think of classic sci fi like \\"Voyage to the bottom of the Sea\\", or \\"Time Tunnel\\", or \\"Land of the Giants\\", or \\"Outer Limits\\" or the \\"Twilight Zone\\", and I can't but help conclude that the Next Generation fan is an ignorant individual when it comes to drama; both written and performed. How is it that they can get \\"A's\\" in physics, chemistry, mathematics, and even score high in basic humanities, but completely strike out when it comes to being critical of something they love?     Remember what I said before about scientists falling in love with their theories?  I think this rings true here.   And yet these are the people who are allegedly critical in their analysis of all things, but apparently science-fiction drama is not one of them.    Truth is there are a handful or respectable episodes for this show, but by and large it is a real insult to anyone with any kind of consistency in character.    Me, I prefer something a little more substantiative, and less relative than this garbage.
0547258305|4.0|Graceling is the story of Katsa, who is a Graceling - someone born with an extreme skill. In her case, it's the ability to kill. Not like the ability to be okay with killing a person, but the ability to straight up kill somebody with a punch or a slap or however she feels like killing them. If that's not totally badass, I don't know what is. Of course, there are problems that come along with being able to kill a grown man with your bare hands since you were eight years old -- and in Katsa's case, one of these problems is being stuck as the mercenary of the King (who is also her uncle). Also, it creates issues with men, understandably, and Katsa is adamant about her refusal to ever marry. But when she meets Prince Po, who has been graced with amazing combat skills, even Katsa finds herself feeling a little romance. As the story unfolds, not only does Katsa find herself opening up to Po, but the two of them uncover some interesting truths about her Grace and a terrible secret about another ruler that could pose a threat to all of the seven kingdoms.<br /><br />I loved Graceling. It has all of the makings of a great YA fantasy -- lots of adventure, a great romance, and wonderful world-building. I was able to lose myself in the book pretty quickly, and the romance between Katsa & Po never felt overdone. I felt like I was able to relate to the characters, and found them authentic and interesting. Katsa is a great female character; she's strong and tough, but imperfect. The writing is also great -- simple and easy to get through, but still very descriptive.
1569242739|5.0|I've made several of the cupcake recipes and they are all divine!! The recipes are simple, clear and concise. The results are absolutely incredible! I love that the recipes in most cases don't call for bizarre ingredients (egg replacer etc) it's basic stuff that most well-stocked vegan kitchens would have on hand. I made the chocolate cupcakes with a chocolate buttercream icing for Valentine's Day and I swear it's the best chocolate cupcake I've ever eaten! This is cookbook is a must for any vegan!
0670022411|5.0|I loved this book!  I thought that it was really well written and the characters were well drawn.  It was a great mix of witches/vampires/daemons and history.  It was intriguing and different.  I am having a difficult time describing it in this review because everything I type makes it sound really weird, but it isn't.  It just works.  I will refrain from summarizing since that has been well done in other reviews as well as in the book description.  I would say that it is in the tradition of The Witching Hour by Anne Rice, but it is definitely its own book.  (She does make an oblique reference to LeStat, but if you didn't know, you wouldn't know and it wouldn't matter).  I really liked the blend of history and science and the exploration of our origins as well as the ethical dilemmas of relationships across \\"species.\\"  She also manages to bring in various themes of agency and consequences which I assume will be discussed more in future books.  I did get a little confused at the very end when she brought so many characters together at once and I had to remember who some of the minor or new characters were, but that would be my only complaint.  I find alchemy to be a fascinating subject and I really enjoyed reading her take on it and look forward to seeing how she continues it.  As for it being called \\"Twilight for grown-ups\\"...if I had known that ahead of time it may have kept me from reading it.  This book is actually about something or rather, several somethings; not just juvenile mind candy as that tagline implies. I looked forward to reading other books by Deborah Harkness.

0061733199|5.0|I really got a lot out of this book. Even though the author has been everywhere and done everything, he never comes across as a know it all. He explains things so the average bear can understand them. There are many helpful drawings in the book to give the reader an idea of how a certain situation might be, even if the reader has never seen that scenario before. I train people my self in Emergency Preparedness measures and I personally got a lot from the book that I use to help others. Training brings peace of mind.
B00499K9E0|5.0|I heard about the new Sherlock reboot on a few websites last year, but never got around to watching them.  Finally decided that with the Amazon VOD credits they handed out, I might as well give it a shot.    I am very pleased, with the quality!  The production value of the show seems high (I'm by no means an expert, but I was happy it didn't look or feel cheaply made) and the scripts are solid.  There isn't a whole lot of character development, but I wasn't bothered by it since the archetype characters are well known.  The introduction in Ep 1 for Watson seemed a bit forced (setting up his army vet backstory) and rushed, but I quickly forgot once the case got underway.    I expected the \\"Aha!\\" moments by Sherlock to be head scratchers, but they really aren't that much of a stretch.  Luckily, he usually explains step by step to Watson how he got to his conclusion, which lets the viewer go through the steps and see if they could ever have came to the same idea.    I enjoyed Ep 2 \\"Study in Pink\\" the most, but that doesn't mean I was disappointed in the other two.      If you're a Sherlock fan, definitely check out the new episodes.  If you're a fan of mystery novels and movies, try an episode and see if the rapid-fire sleuth style works for your preferences.      I'm intrigued by the 90min long \\"episodes\\" which are ultimately individual feature-length films, but I'm not positive if I prefer it over the traditional 45min format.  It's wishful thinking, but I think I would prefer 45min long episodes with recurring story arcs (i.e. one case isn't necessarily solved in one episode but comes back up and is solved later).  Sherlock seems like the kind of guy who could multi-task and would probably benefit from working multiple ideas at once.  I know that wouldn't work great for TV, but in reality, how often is a complicated case solved before anything else comes up?    I'll be patiently waiting for moooore!

0307387178|4.0|Great book. The story surely touched alot of people as there's well over 1000 reviews. I'm sure it saddens some people, inspires others. Like most people I kinda knew the story going in, but this was much deeper of course. The author is a great writer, really good at descriptions. Good vocabulary. There were many moments I felt like I was right there, on a train, in the cold, or on the bus. Some people no doubt think this kid was an unprepared moron, some feel he had the right idea. I think it's best to agree with a bit of each side and find a realistic place in the middle to exist. Sometimes life needs to be simplified, just not this much. Overall his travels were quite an adventure, as is the book. I'd almost call it essential reading for any traveler, or dreamer. Read it, see the movie, and get the Eddie Vedder soundtrack. All three are good stuff.
0375842209|3.0|I had just gone to bed one night and was settling in when I heard what was clearly my roommate crying. I got up, because I knew it was my roommate, and I was prepared to comfort her through whatever it was that had upset her. I opened her bedroom door and saw that her face was covered in tears, and that she had this book in her hands. \\"I'm okay, it's just so sad!\\" she said.     So of course I had to read this book. I didn't cry, but I can see why she did. This book is quite good and has a sad ending. The only reason I didn't cry was because my favorite character didn't die.... But my roommate's did. And you'll have to read it to find out who is who's.

0786956291|3.0|The new Red Box from WOTC is an attempt to re-create that experience a lot of us had opening our first basic set.  It contains a player book and dungeon master book a set of quick reference cards a detailed color map and a full page of counters that have different monsters on either side.      Pros: I love the map and the counters.  The map is large and you can cut it down to change dungeon configurations.  The counters are a die cut card stock and are of good quality even though the die cuts aren't lined up perfectly. The dungeon master's book has a lot of monsters and a bunch of adventures to run your new characters through.  The price for this set on Amazon is awesome and the free shipping option keeps it cheap if you don't mind waiting.    Cons: The character creation process is a tedious single player chose your own adventure game.  Amusing at first but annoying later when trying to generate a party of adventurers.  There is no armor or equipment lists to customize your characters.  I would have liked to seen a few pages in the back of the players handbook that were for character generation all summed up.  My last gripe about this is the fact this book can only generate first level characters...!  Seriously?  The original Basic set allowed you to get to level 3 before having to purchase the Expert box set to go up in level.  There is an option to bring your character up to level 2 in the new set but you don't really get all the detailed advantages you would get in \\"Heroes of the Fallen Lands\\" book.      I like the Red Box for all the extras but feel it falls short of being a great starting set due to the lack of character development and leveling.  I purchased the Monster Vault (which is exceptional) and Heroes of the Fallen Lands to supplement this set and I am quite happy with all of them together.  Next I am planning on buying the Dungeon Masters box set and Heroes of the Forgotten Kingdoms to round out my game.
0670022411|2.0|This book's subject matter is very interesting.  I really liked the historic perspective on the subject.  I also really like the vampire/witch and supernatural genre.  However, the author has some serious pacing issues; its almost like she gets her characters \\"stuck\\" in a location and doesn't know how to properly keep the Action of the story going.      We remain stuck in Oxford, where we meet Matthew, and a host of other supernatural beings, and we are told there's danger lurking for Diana, who doesn't yet know how to use her magic.  She's checked out a book from the library that others really want.  This is all intriguing, but the author telling all of this rather than showing us truly menacing characters and action, doesn't really provide the urgency needed.  Instead we are given an overlong treatment of what kind of person Diana is (she really, really likes to exercise) and how she slowly falls for Matthew's scent and his adorable, sexist ways that are excusable because he's 1,500 years old.    Finally, they move on to France, Matthew's massive Chateau, where he can protect ( and woo) Diana properly, which provides yet another plodding setting.  There's a LOT of talking, not so much action until 50% into the book!  Finally, because for some reason, Diana has no protective instincts, something happens!  We go someplace else, and we meet someone who's really bad and Matthew has to try to save her.  Before they get there, the author does a good job with the action and developing Diana's magical abilities and solving the mystery of why she hesitates to use it.    Solving that mystery is why they are forced to go to NY to be with her family.  Tons of other friendly creatures stay at the house with them to strategize on this inter-species war thats developing.  Frankly, I was more concerned with how to feed all those people, because of course, the author pretty much mentions the preparation of each beverage, snack and meal.      Oh, and they get all prepared for a promising journey....because they need time (which she could have bought herself in the first half of the novel if they'd skipped a yoga class!) for Diana to perfect her magic in order to fight this war.  As they leave on this journey, the book ends!    This book's subject matter could have been so interesting, given the author's historical knowledge.  The problem is, I don't think she knows how to write a story, and she lacked a really disciplined and skilled editor.  I will absolutely not buy the obvious sequel.
034544678X|5.0|This book focuses on the differences between humans and dogs as different animal species. Humans tend to treat dogs like they are humans (read - human babies). This confuses the poor dogs but they have learnt to put up with it in most cases eventhough they are not happy. It is one thing to love your dog and it is another thing to make them happy. If you want to make your dog happy then this is the book to read.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|Contemporary movie makers don't understand how to make -- or don't want to make -- heroic movies any more, with the exception of cartoon stories. This is particularly true for male stars. Women can be heroes, but not men. This is a heroic story, with heroic characters. It's one of my favorites, and I watch it from time to time to get my mind right. If you enjoy good stories, with characters that you care about, and are inspired by heroic deeds, this one's for you.
B003U0AHBO|4.0|A different take on the Robin Hood legend. An interesting story and probably departs from the truth about the era more than most although the take on Richard is more probably more accurate. Cate Blanchett was great and Russel Crowe is well suited for this type of role. It is a little like Gibson in Braveheart.
0553382152|2.0|I've wanted to read this book for a very long time. I finally got it on cassette and listened to it. If I had listened to this in the 70's, I probably would have given it a 5 star rating. But now in 2011, our world has changed, our views and beliefs have changed, I've changed. I enjoyed the book until she got to the part where she apparently died alone in the hospital during the night. As she went on to talk about her experience, I felt like I was sitting in the pew of a very evangelistic church. Her account of her experience sounds very much like things she was taught in church. While I believe this woman honestly remembers this the way she has told it, it's just odd how she mixes very religious views with new age views. They really don't gel very well.. She states that reincarnation doesn't exist, and yet so many of her \\"new age\\" views hint at reincarnation. For those who have an evangelistic belief system, I would guess the book would be very enjoyable.. For those of us who have a more \\"new age\\" belief system, or have felt the shift happening in the world, it's just too religious. Something else that bothered me is that she states it took much prodding from friends and family to get her to write this book, and that there is more that has come to her throughout the years, but she would wait before sharing those experiences with others. That sounds like someone who's wanting to keep the money rolling in to me.. Overall, it was just very disappointing (to me). There's so many other books available these days on this topic without all the religious overtone, I'd suggest looking for one of those, unless, of course, you want to believe your religious views are fact. To each their own.
0061353248|4.0|Very, very easy to read, which is refreshing for a non-fiction book by an academic. Ariely outlines tremendously simple concepts conveyed in a straight-forward, generous and kind manner. Most of his experiments are common sense social situations that everyone can relate to.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rigorous scientific analysis and mind blowing results, then this may not be the book for you. A lot of Ariely's results can be gleaned from acute observation and pattern recognition of people interacting in the world around us.<br /><br />Also, be sure to take 20 minutes and watch Dan Ariely's TED talk. In the talk he introduces a few of the opening concepts in the book such as relativity of price. If you enjoy his personality and description of concepts in the TED lecture, the book experience will be identical. After watching Ariely speak I found that I read the book with his voice and manner in mind, making a more light-hearted read.

0756405890|4.0|My wife and I both loved this book.  Yes the story isn't so unique that it will turn your life around. However, the story is good and the writing is great.  Together that makes a pretty great book.  All of his writing is important and to the point.  Rothfuss doesn't waste words on pointless details like so many fantasy others do and he does a great job of taking a story that, on the surface, seems standard and really making it his own and making you care about it and the characters.  It is a story that all readers can enjoy, both fantasy and non-fantasy fans and both children and adults.  Here's to hoping The Wise Man's Fear is just as good!
0812973992|4.0|What can I say. McCann is good. Very good. His capacity to breath life into his characters is a true gift. I was born in '74 and have a real nostalgia for that decade.

I'm a guy, and I cried more than once.  Highly recommended!
B0046MOVD0|4.0|Me and my hubby watched this movie last night. I really liked it. Now Resident Evil Afterlife do have it's weak points, and this film is mindless action and little else, but what it is is done quite well. This film have gone back to the more classical zombie survival horror type movie this time. Alice and Claire join a group of survivors holed up in a old jail, Alice have lost her Tvirus powers so while she still fight like nobody's business she no longer have the ability to just mow zombies down at will, zombies actually pose a danger to her. Other than that this film is like the rest, Umbrella is evil, Alice is though and the zombies are hungry.<br /><br />The action scenes are spectacular, they are well choreographed and very entertaining to watch and this is good as hardly five minutes pass buy without something exploding, someone shooting or some insane acrobatics ending in deader zombies taking place. The special effects for this film is great, it obviously had a big budget. If you are trying to decide whatever or not to get Resident Evil: Afterlife in DVD or blu-ray I would say go for the blu-ray as the visual are definitely the biggest part of this film.<br /><br />One thing I have to give this film credit for is that it really feels like a computer game, right down to a end boss. Every location and fight have the feel of a level in a computer game and as such this film really pay homage to the games. Now as to the 3D, I do not have a 3D TV so I did not see those effects, however there are several places in the film where a shot is held for a very long time and so on where it is clear that there is some 3D effect going on for those with TV's capable of showing that, however this is never so in your face as to be distracting and while you notice it is there it just blends into the movie.<br /><br />The plot of Resident Evil: Afterlife is rather thin, if what you are looking for is deep, involving storylines then this movie is not for you, the plot is an excuse to have elaborate action sequences, however the plot do it's job and there is just enough of it to keep the viewer interested in the action. You are not going to come away from this film with a feeling of having seen anything deep and meaningful, but if you like action or zombies then my guess is that you will be entertained. One more note on the action also, Resident Evil: Afterlife is rather full of gore, however the gore parts are filmed in a way that feels very outlandish, I am not saying that it look fake, but it do not give that much of a shock effect so that people who are squeamish about gore might still like this film.<br /><br />I must also say that I love that Executioner Majini have an appearance in this film, sure the character is a blatant Pyramid Head ripoff, however he looks both impressive and menacing and the scenes with him are my favorites in Resident Evil: Afterlife.<br /><br />To wrap this review up, I think Resident Evil: Afterlife is a great action film, it has a weak plot, but it is well shot and entertaining and it just plain works. I really enjoyed watching this film, and while it is by no means perfect I think it is very good and I definitely recommend it.tion sequences, however the plot do it's job and there is just enough of it to keep the viewer interested in the action.

B004KPLVW2|3.0|This is a SciFi move with tons of special effects. It is not worth buying again on Blue Ray until they remaster it. No movie shot on film is worth buying on Blue Ray unless its been remastered. It just doesn't make sense. Throwing in tons of extras isn't goanna make the movie HI DEF. If you already have it on DVD then this version isn't gonna look any better. It just might look worse.
0761119752|5.0|I first read this book when I was a student baby sitting for extra bucks. I discovered there was a rythm to the story and I turned it into a song. The kids loved it! now I have a little girl and bed time is her favorite time of day because of the book. She doesn't speak very well but sings along and knows what to say at each page. Sometimes she skips pages to her favorite parts (like \\"pajama to the left, pajama to the right). it's so adorable. I'm glad that i started singing it to her otherwise I'd have been worn down with reading the same book every day of the year.  A must buy!!
0439023521|4.0|I really liked this book and the next two in the trilogy.  What a good series!  I didn't give it five stars because I've read better--I have to admit-- but it definitely makes for a good read.  It's very fast-paced and hard to put down.  I wish Katniss, the main character, had a little more emotion.  Sometimes I couldn't tell if I really liked her or not  --I loved Peeta though!
B003E8P9G0|5.0|I loved this book as I love all of Riordan's books. I especially loved the two-part chapters, so both characters got to voice their opinions.
B00461BQC0|5.0|I first heard KOL with their single the bucket five years ago. I had checked them out then, and wasn't overly impressed. I heard them again with their single use somebody... checked out that CD and didn't think it was worth buying the whole thing. A year or two later I heard Pyro and Radiation and thought I'd give KOL one last chance. Listed to the whole CD on grooveshark and d**n this is a fun album. I think every song is worth listening to, and many of them will make it into my regular rotation for a long time to come. If you're new to KOL or if you haven't sprung for one of their whole CD's yet I'd encourage you to check this one out.
B00280LYIM|5.0|If you are thinking about reading this book, stop. Read the first three books FIRST! You have to read these books in order to really enjoy them. They are great books, so great I can't even describe them. And this book is too.
0670022411|1.0|I had such high hopes for this book. It sounded so intresting. I've read 70 pages now and here's what has happened so far. Diana went rowing twice and to the library three times. Because she looked at an old manuscript in the library for 30 seconds, a bunch of witches, \\"daemons\\" and one really boring vampire are following her around. Why? I guess they don't know how to access materials at the library themselves. How does stuff like this get published?
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book, just as I love all of Rick Riordan's other books. I haven't met anyone who dosen't like his books and I don't think that I ever will. This book deserves infiniti stars, as do all of Riordan's books.
0545265355|5.0|At first I was worried that for such a great price, this would not be the hardback set as advertised, but I decided to take the chance and order anyway.  I'm glad I did.  Not only is it a nice, hardback set of all three Hunger Games books dressed in the standard dusk jacket, it also comes with a box to display all three of the books in decorated with the mockingjay pin artwork.  Very nice, and a HUGE savings off the list price of $18 per book!
B00280LYHS|5.0|I don't know how to describe this book. It's just impossible for me, how ____________ this book is. If only it were reality, that would be the only thing better than this book. This book you will want to never put down, even when it's over.
B00129H7VS|5.0|It was fun to watch, definitely a must own. BluRay is the way to go and I enjoyed this series a lot.
B0035OC7OU|4.0|I've only just begun reading Terry Pratchett's Discworld series a month ago. If only one word can be used to describe them it would definitely be 'addictive'. The first two books was a big magical romp through a parody land. There was depth there, to be sure, but it wasn't realized. The third offering, Equal Rites, was alright. Less humorous but it did a lot of good things for the book's universe. This one, however, seems to have taken the best parts of the first three and put them altogether. It's hilarious, addictive, and has a great, interesting story on top of it. I'd suggest this book to anyone.
B003ZYU3T6|5.0|I have the Criterion Blu Ray version of Modern Times now and it's the best copy yet of this film.  They have restored it in both picture and sound, and the speed of the film is correct.  The speed of the chaplin collection DVD was cranked a little too fast and that's why I give that previous version 4 stars instead of 5 (when the boss tells Charlie to get back to work, his voice sounded a little chipmonkey because of it).  I found that all films from that previous DVD collection seemed to be cranked up too fast!  I won't go into the plot of the film.  I'll leave that to the other reviewers.  If you have the VHS and/or that previous DVD of Modern times and have a Blu Ray player, I recommend you get this Criterion Blu Ray copy.  It's worth the purchase!  Also the bonus materials give away some movie making tricks he did.  I didn't even realize what a genius he was with special effects.
B00338QENI|5.0|It's been months since I read this book and I still am processing what I read. I wanted to create a review though to add my 5 stars and pass the good word about this gripping novel.    I finished the book in less than a week. I kept reading more each day to get to the part where it all turns around for the family. Well, let's just say you will be amazed at how it ends. Or, depending on how cynical you are, you may not be amazed at all.    The overall story is how we, those who have had surgery  even in this day and age, still have no control over the contents removed from our own body cavities. Although it is possible to exert control, through lawyers and contracts and the like, but the norm for Drs nowadays is to have you sign away your rights with your surgery consent forms.  Ms. Skloot shed light on a topic no one ever talks about because we just don't know about it.    Mrs. Lacks' story can be compared to slavery as well. Slavery permeated the economy on all levels; so many companies, industries and the government itself benefited from the free labor used to create products and services that were sold to make others extremely wealthy. This is the same story of Mrs. Lacks' cells, freely taken and sold to various companies, industries and even to the government  for profits well into the billions.    This is a story that has to be told. I hope it's true that a movie is in the works. My hope is that the primary companies involved will be publically shamed and forced into rightfully compensating this family.
031603438X|5.0|A penetrating and voluminous account of one of the most interesting lives ever lived. A man who has been able to indulge ad infinitum his love for such things as books, travel, music, drugs, and women; and live to tell the story. How can we not want to listen?<br /><br />What a spectacular story of humble beginnings in England and a passion for American blues! This engaging and absorbing work offers rich detail concerning his early years of musical influences and the amazing magical journey that became the Rolling Stones. We see the impact that American music had on young English rockers bent on creating their own version of blues with simply the modest hope of playing to decent crowds in small venues. I don't think any of them saw the stadiums coming! Though so much of extremely popular \\"white rock\\" is shaped by \\"black blues,\\" it was impossible at the time to know what kind of amazing success would be in their future.<br /><br />A strange synchronicity in talents seemed to occur among the disparate personalities in the band that allowed for profound mystical accomplishments to emerge. Their dedication and focus on creating something powerful and unique seemed unavoidable. The uncanny collaborations would never have suggested such ego battles behind closed doors that this book insightfully reveals. I was shocked by Keith's candor in expressing his ire toward Mick Jagger through the years. Obviously, his respect for the powerful creative dyad between he and Mick took precedence over petty squabbles.<br /><br />While the collective stage persona of the band suggested harmony and permanence, there were tumultuous goings-on that could easily have ripped things asunder in a manner that would have prevented the creation of so many classic songs and iconic albums. Addictions, and ego battles, did not stand in the way of the creation of timeless classics that inform the memories of so many lives across the globe! There is the hinting that in strange ways perhaps those elements (addictions/ego battles) fueled the power of the creative output, though Keith is quick to mention that he would recommend for no one to take all the particular steps he personally took.<br /><br />What shines through in this book, so amazingly, is the fact that Keith is a lover of life, an epicurean, and a sensualist with inclinations toward intellectual and artistic pursuits that will surprise some readers. He has so often been unfairly typecast, or pigeonholed, into a tragically simplistic stereotype that does not even scrape the surface of the deepness and complexity of this man. The fact that so many people have purchased this book is a welcome reminder that we always knew there was so much more to him than the suggestions of tabloid blabber. The book truly delivers the punch.<br /><br />There is brutal honesty and self-reflection in this work that will leave their mark on the reader. The story is an irresistible page-turner you will hate to put down, even as you realize that it eventually will come to an end: though the indomitable spirit of Keith Richards lives forever! One leaves this highly satisfying reading experience having newfound love for life in all its perplexities, and nuances, and a simply charmed sense of how cool it must be to be friends with the one-and-only Keith Richards.ctions/ego battles) fueled the power of the creative output, though Keith is quick to mention that he would recommend for no one to take all the particular steps he personally took.

B003AO1SVS|5.0|I LOVE this album. I haven't bought any music in a long time and this was a satisfying purchase for sure!
B000A2W1X2|5.0|Beautifully filmed and acted, this story captures love and despair.  Sophie Marceau is also as beautiful as she is a wonderful actress.  I saw this several years ago and I have been looking for the movie to add to my collection. Bravo!
B000W1V5OC|5.0|Never, ever, before have I (a listener/musician, age 56) been so captivated by anyone's music. What emotion and musicianship! One day, I heard some very incredible music that I was sure was the score for Final Fantasy on YouTube. It fit so well. Enter Nightwish. Looking for anything by Nightwish at the store, what appeared to be a \\"Metalhead\\" (I now believe to have been an Angel) directed me to \\"End of an Era\\". It instantly became my breakfast and dinner every day for at least 6 months. And that is NO exaggeration! Lately, whenever I want music with real \\"substance\\" it is ALWAYS \\"End of an Era\\" that I run to. (Well, OK, I do have an extremely important place in my mind and heart for Dark Passion Play\\" as well).  Tuomas Holopainen, composer/brain child of this great work, has given to the world a phenomenal combination of some of the best musical forms from old Europe including symphony, choral, and opera. Combined with this already magnificent work, he makes it become an integral part of today's heavy metal musical art form. One could not exist with out the other and have such great emotional impact. In my humble opinion, whether you enjoy \\"End of an Era\\" or not, it is something you should be familiar with. And so, the Vikings have returned but, for some reason, they have come in peace. Now that's another subject.
B002N44XSG|2.0|horrible! this book is the worst book ever!  i thought it would be good but it was very bad.                            emma topeka,kansas
B000GG4KTU|5.0|Diana Krall is a must for anyone who loves easy listening music.  Combination of her voice and piano is a listening pleasure.  I have several of her cd's and they do not disappoint.
B004I2K4E8|3.0|I may be bias for Ruthie Henshall but she stole the show in the 10th Anniversary and her youtubes from that concert prove it.  I actually became a big fan of Les Miserables through watching the 10th Anniversary then scouring for whatever other clips i could find, then eventually purchased the 10th Anniversary DVD from Amazon.  Then i became a fan of Ruthie but that is not to say i didn't enjoy the other talent, in fact i was hopelessly addicted to the music from Les Mis altogether.  This concert is okay and not bad but Lea Songalia who plays Fantine just isn't that same immaculate voice that Ruthie has.  I enjoyed Lea's early youtube clips of her doing the Disney Aladain songs and her voice was excellent for those songs but i have not enjoyed her much in the Les Mis concerts including this one.  Her voice just seems too light and tender with a higher pitch for my tastes.  If you haven't watched or listened to the 10th Anniversary Concert i'd recommend purchasing that one before this.  There is a reason why Ruthie Henshall's TAC Youtube clips have so many views and its probably the best concert performance i've ever seen between I dreamed a dream, Come to me, and Lovely Ladies.

B002ZG981E|5.0|The special features and the brilliant transfer to Blu-Ray makes this one of the year's Top 3 Blu-Rays to own and perhaps it made the top 20 Blu-rays of the past decade.
B004HWR406|3.0|While it was 'interesting' to a degree I think they got Mark Z wrong. He was like Rainman meets Bill Gates. That may not seem like much of a stretch but a monotone dialog is boring I don't care who you are. A great performance by Justin Timberlake was completely overlooked. I'm just glad I rented it with a free credit from Amazon or else I'd be mad if I had PAID for it.
B004BLJQOK|5.0|Enough of this American remake differs from the original to make it fresh, and yet it honors the material in the first well. A little more backstory is told. The dreariness of the original isn't quite here and the original still gets the top rating but this is a close 4 of 5 stars. If you liked the first, you will have no problem enjoying this one. If you never saw the first, you should see it first... and then make this Let Me In your close second to watch next.
B000063DGC|5.0|Randy Rhoads.  Not his best performance, and this is not the best sound quality (Ozzy cleaned up the vox a bit), but a definite must-have for any RR fan.  The unaccompanied solo on Suicide Solution is worth the price of the disc.    Having said that, the sound quality on The King Biscuit Flour Hour was more true to the live sound, and captured RR on a better night, and I believe was recorded closer to March 19th 1982.  I wish I had that cassette now that I taped off the radio back in 1982...    Anyway, no one will ever sound like this again.  All of Ozzy's guitarists since then DO NOT COMPARE. Hats off to Jake, Zakk for trying. Ozzy's writing since then does not compare.  RR's was a special style and sound that cannot be imitated.  My number one reason for picking up guitar.
B0032TG686|5.0|Grace has had a weird obsession for the wolves that live behind her families home ever since she was attacked by them as a child. You would think she would be scared of them but instead she is left fascinated, especially by the one with yellow eyes. The one who saved her from the rest of the pack that terrible day.<br />This book was alittle hard to follow for the first 30 pages but hang in there. You'll be soooooo glad you did! After you get over that hump the pages start flying and before you know it, you've laughed, you've cried, and you left staring at the last page. I finished this book in a day and thank goddess I had Linger sitting there because I don't think I would have made it through the night. I dove right into the sequel.<br />This is a touching and tragic love story with a twist that I really enjoyed!!
B00005K9LK|4.0|Great album, however, Another Thing Comin is one of the worst Priest songs ever and is still the only thing radio plays by them, because its wimpy.  I wish they wouldnt patronize audiences by playing it live...its a joke.    Anyone hear Hellion playing on the new Honda Odyssey commercial?
1439190275|4.0|This is a well-written, intelligent update on the Atkins diet.  My issue is with the diet itself, not the book.  It is true for me, and perhaps for others, that eating too much fat puts fat on me.  I cannot eat many of the approved foods such as bacon, nuts, and cheese-I just gain weight.  I think this is a great plan for those for whom sugar is a problem:  Case in point is my husband, a sugar-holic who has thus far (less than a month) lost 15 pounds.  I believe in eating low-carb, unprocessed foods.  For me, however, I don't have a problem with sugar and I just can't (sniff) eat the fat.
B00005R62N|5.0|What hasnt been said before?  I used to crank Genocide on vinyl and get my ears close to the speakers so I could play air guitar to Glenn's whoop ass intro!  This album smokes!!!!!!!!!!  Regardless of LIVE, studio, or in between.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Right so the story is actually pretty simple - Stunt man is injured and ends up in the same hospital as a little girl.  Little girl is basically adorable but also the nosy neighbor busy body of the hospital.  Instead of playing with the kids her own age, she's always hopping from adult to adult doing what kids do best - asking \\"Why?\\" and getting in the way, exploring things they shouldn't explore, but smiling a smile that makes the adults forget the kid is in the way.<br /><br />The stunt man, unable to get up and do his own dirty work figures this little girl is the perfect person to do it for him.  He takes her in as his new best friend.  Tells her stories.  Gains her trust.  All in an attempt to trick her into getting him the pills he needs to end it all. But in life things don't always go as planned.<br /><br />It has all I could want in a movie -<br /><br />Character interaction so good that the movie relies heavily on it, even while having other tricks up its sleeve (in this case stunning graphics) - check<br /><br />Beautifully filmed - check<br /><br />Even the aspects that you feel have been done before (c'mon nothing is 100% original) do feel new in the movie - check<br /><br />Really it grabbed my full attention and didn't let go.  I'm recommending that everyone I know see it.
0895260131|5.0|I have over 20+ years in the US Army.  Mostly in the Special Operations.  I have been deployed/lived in the following Muslim nations (Iraq, Afghanistan, Jordan, Uzbekistan, and now Kuwait).  I have studied Islam, and this book is accurate and spot on.  Islam is a death cult bent on terror and oppression.  I have seen Islam and it is NOT a religion of peace.  It was created by a homocidal maniac who used the scimitar to convert others, not by the merits of the rhetoric.  You want facts?  Here is what the Quran clearly states;  \\"When opportunity arises, kill the infidels wherever you catch them.\\" - Quran 9:5  \\"Any religion other than Islam is not acceptable.\\" - Quran 3:85  \\"The Jews and the Christians are perverts; fight them.\\"- Quran 9:30  \\"Maim and crucify the infidels if they criticize Islam\\"- Quran 5:33  \\"Punish the unbelievers with garments of fire, hooked iron rods, boiling water; melt their skin and bellies.\\" - Quran 22:19  \\"The unbelievers are stupid; urge the Muslims to fight them.\\" - Quran 8:65  \\"Muslims must not take the infidels as friends.\\" - Quran 3:28  \\"Terrorize and behead those who believe in scriptures other than the Quran.\\" - Quran 8:12  \\"Muslims must muster all weapons to terrorize the infidels.\\" - Quran 8:60  Religion of Peace?  Keep believing that up until they put you in an orange jumpsit and have you star in your own Al-Quaeda snuff film!
B002SSUQFG|3.0|In this world where the time is everywhere, those of us who wear wristwatches are increasingly becoming an anachronism -- so it pains me when a sterling piece of equipment like this Seiko does not keep good time!  It picks up about a minute and a half a day -- not the end of the world, but come on!    Otherwise it is quite attractive. I like it but could never marry it...
B000LPQ6DE|4.0|I enjoyed this version of Jane Eyre.  I have a crush on Toby Stevens after seeing it.  However, the intense passion between Jane and Rochester seems a bit implausible sometimes -because she is so plain.  I know that in the novel she is supposed to be plain, but so is Rochester.  I think the director chose an actor who is almost too good looking for this role.  His rugged, handsome face is distracting compared to Jane's sad, plain face.  I don't want to be harsh, but I find the attraction between them a little hard to believe.
B002VPE1AW|4.0|Great visuals and music highlight this remake of the FERN GULLY cartoon set on another planet.  Cameron's film does not include the song LAND OF 1000 DANCES featured in the original, however (probably a royalties thing).

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|I must say, this book gave me pause. I have always been skeptical of the low-carb approach to eating, it just sounded too darn unhealthy. And of course, the standard \\"calories in / calories out\\" account of why people get fat or obese made superficial sense. After all, surely we are going to take into account basic principles of thermodynamics when talking about people's energy balance, right? But the book does make a compelling case - based on a review of both the recent technical literature and the long history of these debates - that the calories in/out paradigm is much too simplistic. Human bodies are complex biological machines, and the quality of the food we take in does make a difference to how the body treats it. The author's explanation of \\"adiposity 101\\" is compelling, clear, and as a biologist makes perfect sense to me. More delicate is the issue of the non-weight related effects of a diet rich in proteins and fat, though there too there are plenty of myths to debunk, as Gary Taubes discusses research that shows how the so-called \\"good\\" cholesterol, the major predictor of heart problems, actually goes up (a good thing) following a low-carb regime. Of course, one needs to proceed with caution in this area, after all it is a matter of your long term health. But this isn't really a diet book, it's a book about the bunk that passes for good science in nutritional advice. You may want to read it, consider it, and then ask serious questions to your doctor.
B0042816YK|2.0|Is there a more wishy washy actress than Julia Roberts? I certainly haven't come across one. Perhaps the least deserving Best Actress Oscar winner in history, Roberts has relied on her 'charming smile' to get through roles without any discernible 'acting' going on. Case in point : \\"Erin Brokovich\\" and the woefully overwrought \\"My Best Friends Wedding\\". However, there are some of us who find Roberts' wide jawed smile rather disconcerting, unsettling and a little frightening, and lets just say this film does nothing to prove her case as an 'actress'.<br /><br />The book was bad enough (not many of you know that what happened to the author after the book was published and it is probably not going to make a very savory movie), but the film takes all of its vapid elements and multiplies it by a 100. The 'Pray' section for instance, is bewildering. Its difficult to ascertain what Roberts is going through when she closes her eyes on her meditative journeys, but on film these segments don't make any sense and don't reveal anything at all, except that a woman somewhere is closing her eyes. The director is especially gifted at sucking the life out of a scene, it has to be mentioned.<br /><br />The problem is with the script, as well as with Roberts over-confident performance. She might perhaps think that shes at a stage in her life where she can 'walk through' any role, but lets face it, the woman barely got through \\"The Mexican\\" without being upstaged by Pitt at every stage so she should really rethink her acting strategies. The worst part is the end, which neatly ties together her escapades and presents it as a more holistic episode of \\"Sex and the City\\" (should be seen to be believed). The supporting cast, often goodlooking but seldom talented, are totally wasted. The cinematography is beautiful but any of you with a home camera in any of these locations would find it hard to take a bad shot, so thats not saying much. Bali and Italy are pretty hard to tamper with on film. Sadly, they seemed to have captured the worst of India here, which is stereotypical of a film that tries to go the spiritual route (much like Kate Winslet in \\"Holy Smoke\\"). Javier Bardem, who is one of the worlds most nuanced actors is relegated to the role of a caricature here, while James Franco (whos lets face it is not going to win an Oscar for expressionism) plays an enlightened palm reader in Bali, which doesn't at all help matters. Billy Crudup is the best thing about this film, and at least he has the decency to only appear for a few minutes here and there.<br /><br />Bottom line, if you don't like Roberts' 'work', stay far, far away. Also, it might be of note that was a lot of eating going on in the film, and much less praying and loving. Well, at least they could keep their lunch down. Grab a pillow and pray for daylight if this is the mess you plan on renting tonight.<br /><br />An abominable film with no redeeming qualities.<br /><br />Two stars.

0321704452|5.0|To someone who already read Reynolds's bestselling book [[ASIN:0321525655 Presentation Zen: Simple Ideas on Presentation Design and Delivery]] and is wondering if he/she should buy this because PZ already covers all important things about presentation, I would say \\"just go get it!\\"     I bought Presentation Zen about a year ago. It has completely changed my lectures within/outside my university, which resulted in more satisfaction of students and participants than ever.     To be honest, I didn't have enough time to prepare slides and handouts (not \\"sliduments\\") for every lecture to the extent I want them to be. But what was important to me was that I got to know what I should do for better classes, which I didn't even know until I read the book.  Reynolds's new book, The Naked Presenter, contains detailed explanation about the delivery stage, which is one of three steps of presentation: preparation, design, and delivery, all of which Presentation Zen covers.     Before I started reading the Naked Presenter, I suspected that nothing might be new to me since the Presentation Zen already covers important points about the delivery step as well. After reading the book, however, I learned that there are many things I can do to make my lectures and presentation more engaging.       When I read his earlier book Presentation Zen, I found it a book of \\"philosophy\\" about any kind of presentation, not \\"a step-by-step manual\\". The Naked Presenter gets into more details about the delivery process, but is still free from too many rules to memorize. Instead, it provides with a limited number of important principles, such as using proximity, varying pace, focusing on the here and now, and explain why these principles are so important and how we can embody these principles in the actual presentation with or WITHOUT slides. What makes this book so persuasive is that he shows evidence not only from his abundant experiences as a world's leading presenter but from research and presentation examples by experts in various fields, such as musicians, clinical psychologists, and educators.      Like his earlier books, this book is easy to read and amusing in spite of profound insights expressed in the book even for readers who reads English as a second language. This is because he use phrases specific to some cultural context with all possible caution and paraphrase them with simple expression.    Reynolds writes \\"When you present, you are trying to create change in people's minds.\\" His earlier book Presentation Zen created changes in my lectures last year. I am sure the Naked Presenter will create changes in my lectures this year again.
0451450523|5.0|Lyrically written, charming, and engaging, The Last Unicorn can be best appreciated if it is read on its own terms.  It is not a sweeping epic like any of J. R. R. Tolkien's works, nor a religious allegory like many of C.S. Lewis' works, nor a Disneyesque fairy tale with the perfunctory happy ending.  Anyone reading it and expecting some variant of these other works will be disappointed.  What The Last Unicorn does is take the traditional literary forms of the quest and the fairy tale, then stand them on their head in a very post-modern sort of way.  It does this to entice readers to ponder the philosophical questions that author Peter S. Beagle considers important.    One certainly does not have to read The Last Unicorn in some deeply philosophical manner to enjoy it.  As a simple tale, it is entertaining enough, with wonderful prose, imagery, and characters that will stay with you for a long time.  There is the creaky witch, Mommy Fortuna, her Midnight Carnival, and the Harpy that will be her doom.  There is Schmendrick, the hapless magician, struggling to tap his inner wizard.  There is the genteel balladeer and highwayman, Captain Cully; his giant of a right-hand man, Jack Jingly; and his earthy charwoman, Molly Grue.  And, of course, there is the Unicorn herself, a majestic and magical creature, a primeval force of nature rooted in eternity itself.    The tale itself begins with the Unicorn in her forest, discovering that she is apparently the very last Unicorn in the world. Although a solitary creature, this disturbs her greatly, so she begins a quest to find her people, leaving her beloved forest behind to travel a dangerous world.  Along the way, she meets new friends (Schmendrick, Molly Grue) who help her overcome the many ordeals and enemies that she encounters along the way.  Ultimately, the quests leads the Unicorn and her companions to the realm of King Haggard, the jaded and miserly ruler of a destitute kingdom by the sea, who may have had something todo with the disappearance of the Unicorns.  At this point, the tale makes some twists and turns, before reaching its final, bittersweet conclusion.    Beneath the tale is a philosophical subtext that delights in exploring the answers to a variety of questions.  What is the nature of illusion?  Can we desire an illusion to be real so much that it does, in fact, become real - until its spell is broken?  What is the difference between time and eternity?  What would an eternal creature be like, and how would we react to it?  If an eternal creature could somehow be made to see things from a mortal's point of view, how would it react?  Beagle doesn't necessarily provide answers to all of these questions - at times, he just raises them for the reader to ponder.    Unfortunately, Beagle can't resist dropping all-too-obvious hints that he is playing a friendly little game with his readers.  Anachronistic references to tacos and field recordings, a butterfly that spouts pop tunes from the 1930's, a talking skull that makes reference to \\"character assassins\\" - Beagle drops a number of not-so-subtle and unnecessary hints, calling the reader's attention to how he is violating the traditional norms of the literary form that he is using, and daring the reader to figure out why.  It's as if Beagle were sitting across the room from the reader, winking and smiling wryly.    In the end, however, Beagle manages to pull off a difficult literary feat - creating a simple and enjoyable story that can be read at a deeper, more philosophical level.  The reader can approach it in either way and take something away from his work.  While it doesn't have quite the same emotional resonance for me as (say) any of Tolkien's works, the Last Unicorn deserves its status as a modern literary classic.
B002EWD0I6|5.0|I put this in last night, planning to watch for an hour or so,@ 7:00 p.m. Well....@ 1:00 a.m., I finally decided to call it a night! Done with discs one, and two.I couldn't believe how quickly the evening passed....perhaps, because I was viewing quality programming. Trust me, you will so enjoy this DVD. It is everything the other reviewers said.Beautifully filmed, characters you will laugh, and cry with, drama, humor,intrigue.....PERFECTION! The Brits really know how to produce high-quality material. It is like watching a visual treat.This is how television SHOULD be!I now plan to purchase the additional DVD's, so I am ready to go, once I finish season one, which at this rate, will be within the next couple of nights, no doubt. Fall in love.....with Lark Rise To Candleford....it doesn't get any better than this. Bravo BBC!
B000AJIF4E|4.0|I bought these based on a recommendation from a web site that specializes in headphones and headphone amplifiers. Their advice has always been good and was again. These circumaural, closed headphones replaced Sennheiser HD580 (not HD-140 as originally reported) headphones  that were circumaural, open.<br /><br />This sound evaluation is from the point of view of a classical music listener. The response seems to be pretty much pure, even, and uncolored across the entire audible spectrum. I heard bass down to frequencies that, heard on loudspeakers, you would feel in your whole body, not just your ears. But no headphones can reproduce that effect. The sound seemed at first hearing to be very subtly different than on the old headphones, but the ear adjusts almost immediately to this.<br /><br />My impression is that these are not high-efficiency headphones. You can get adequate, but not impressive sound levels from a CD-player (I've tried two different ones) without a headphone amplifier. I have not tested the headphones with an iPod or iPhone, but I would guess that the amplifier would enhance the results with either of those, or similar, products<br /><br />They are very comfortable. After as much as three hours of continuous listening, still no discomfort at all over the head or the ears. The Sennheiser headband caused an itchy scalp after a few hours of use, which the Sony headphones apparently are not going to do.<br /><br />They appear to be constructed very solidly. They fold up quite easily with just a little practice, and seem small enough to be practical on an airplane flight. I have not yet tested whether these will shut out enough aircraft noise to be useful for classical music listening, or whether I will have to use my Etymotic earphones for that purpose. But the coiled cable would serve aircraft use well. (It also stretches enough [ten or more feet] that I can listen to Shostakovich's 11th Symphony [a good test for both highs, lows and dynamic range behavior] on my audio system to confirm the audio response as I write this.)<br /><br />I don't see how the last two attributes \\"Takes a beating\\" or \\"durable\\" can be rated until I have used them for several years. But externally, at least, these phones seem well and solidly made, and I don't plan to give them a beating. (The Sennheiser headphones these replaced failed internally after three years. And I thought they were good, too, also recommended by the same specialist site, but apparently no longer available. In comparison with those, these are more comfortable and don't collect lint and dust as the Sennheiser did.<br /><br />In short, I'm happy with them and consider them an improvement over what they replaced, and at a lower price to boot.
B000UJ48VI|5.0|for the longest time i went without this in my collection. SHAME ON ME. this film is epic in every way. from direction to acting, and even our society's notion on who the victim should be. oh yeah, and PETER SELLERS. one of the funniest men to EVER walk the planet. you have to see his dancing! so cool. buy this. you'll be glad you did.  \\"one of Stanley Kubrick's films is like ten of someone else's.\\"  - Martin Scorcese
B004BJMEO6|4.0|Elena Undone is a quality film. Unlike most of the lesbian films I have watched, it doesn't end in crazy. We need more directors like Nicole Conn. The chemistry between the two main actors is incredible. The lighting, cinematography, directing and acting is top notch. I highly recommend this film and I am looking forward to many more from Nicole and Marina.
B0013N7AD8|4.0|Over the years, I have grown up with the Batman character, from the comics, cartoons, and even movies. I have always liked the character, and have been a fan ever since I was a child. When I saw the original films for the first time as a kid, I was quite surprised on how these films changed in style, acting, and even character development. The Batman Anthology is a great set for fans, both hardcore and casual. I got this collection on Blu-Ray, and really liked it. Although only the first three were worth watch and the fourth being the worst comic film of all time, I have to say, I was really impressed with the audio, picture quality, and visuals of these four films. Here are my verdicts:    BATMAN (1989): A true classic. Although Michael Keaton was reduced to a supporting role, His performance was excellent as the dark, twisted and somewhat crazy Batman character. Jack Nicholson shines as the Joker, providing the comedic and  tragic rendition of Batman's classic nemesis. Kim Basinger was okay as Vicki Vale, providing an elegance and sophistication to her role, and gives the film a light, romantic lift from its tragic overtones.    Overall 5 out of 5    BATMAN RETURNS (1992): A great sequel. This one had me entertained from the first scene onward. Keaton once again dons the cape, and is in the supporting role, despite it being the principal main character. Danny Devito is gritty, hilarious and sometimes disgusting as the tragic and garish Penguin, who tries to take over Gotham City. Michelle Pfeiffer steals the show as Cat woman, who represents the dark, twisted side of female nature. She is sexy, seductive and perfectly believable as the secretary turned femme-fatale. Christopher Walken is excellent as Max Shreck, the downright dirty and corrupt business man who will stop at nothing to get what he wants in what he considers a \\"dog eat dog\\" world. Shreck also remains determined to leave his business behind for his son, Chip who he hopes will carry on his legacy.    Overall 5 out of 5    BATMAN FOREVER (1995): A Good sequel, but this is where things start to go bad..very bad. I liked, and will admit sometimes loved this movie, but it does have many flaws. Val Kilmer is the newcomer to the Batman Franchise, and provides a believable and brooding rendition to Batman, but lacks the playboy, jet-setter attitude that shapes his alter-ego, Billionaire Bruce Wayne. Kilmer is quite stale as Bruce, despite being taller, and more stylish looking than Keaton. In the Keaton Films, Batman was fighting for the soul of his city, determined to protect it from violent criminals and psychopaths. Now it seems, that Batman is just protecting the peace, showing up only when there's trouble, or out on a date. Jim Carrey on the other hand is excellent, if not sensational as the Riddler, delivering on his comedic, and acting talents. Every riddler/nygma scene is unique, giving a new shape and direction in Carrey's performance. Tommy Lee Jones is crazy and ruthless as Harvey Two face,  giving energy and humor to the character, but the script forces him to mimic the Joker's howling and laughing, which makes the character resemble the Joker than anything else. Two Face just wants to kill Batman, and crashes parties, Charity events and robs banks to do it. That's it! No unique Character Development! No tragic connections! No intrigue! I was expecting more out of the DA gone wrong, a district attorney obsessed with duality. Chris O' Donnell Stars as Robin- the orphaned acrobat we all know and love. His story is comes straight from the comics, and is well represented. His portrayal was focused and centered towards the young adults. Chris does a good job, and is very believable as a young man out for revenge. Nicole Kidman teases and tantalizes as the sexy, beautiful Dr. Chase Meridian- her scenes are one of the best parts of the film and her sex appeal is very evident in this movie. She seduces Batman, and the two share some kinky scenes in the film. She isunique as a female character, because she immediately goes after Batman, whose life is always in peril. Kidman looks her best with the blonde hair, red lips and all. She plays the role well, and brings elegance and sophistication to the picture. Her Character has one unique flaw- she's just a love interest, nothing more. I would have liked Chase even more if she had a unique connection to Bruce Wayne's past in some way, or even if she were to have more involvement in helping Batman stop criminals and protect Gotham from crime, rather than just throwing herself at him, and then ending the relationship. Still, Kidman is good as the damsel in distress.    Overall 4 out 5    BATMAN & ROBIN (1997): Simply: Unacceptable! To this day, I CANNOT believe this film was made! Even when I was a child I couldnt bare to watch it. It was so bad, it was painful to watch. It gave me a headache. It was too dumbed down for the kids! It looked too much like a toy commercial! George Clooney as Batman?  What were they thinking? Clooney is one hollywoods great actors and has been great to watch, but why Batman? I don't understand. O' Donnel returns as Robin, but again his character is also too dumbed down, where's the desire to right wrongs?  getting over the death of his family? It seems everything is just a bit too good for Dick Grayson this time around. Alicia Silverstone as Batgirl-Although she was very attractive in the film- the writers got the batgirl character wrong- in the comics Batgirl is Comissioner Gordon's Daughter, forbidden from joining the GCPD. She doesnt even train or perfect her martial arts, she just puts on her costume, and without explantation or preamble starts fighting crime as Batgirl!! I still don't understand. Uma Thurman's Performance as Poison Ivy was good- the only thing done right. She is beautiful and seductive, much like Kidman and Pfeiffer were in the previous films. Arnold Shwarzenneger's performance as Mr. Freeze- it was funny, but too much one liners and not enough attention to the material. Again, these films are taken from comic books, why cant filmmakers pay attention to that? Bane- just a big thug, no smarts or human speech what so ever- he's not even determined to best Batman! Why? This film is terrible and if anyone enjoyed it, they maybe should get some help. My Advice: Just buy the first three films on blu-ray, don't get this one.    Overall 0.25 out 5    Final thoughts- These films were a trip back in time- Back when films were fun and engaging, not just character studies or tear-jerking dramas. I liked and thouroughly enjoyed the first three films and loved the nostalgia they carry with them.  Great for fans and movie lovers. The extras are the same as with the DVD version. But there are 8 language tracks including English (5.1), French (5.1) Spanish (Castillan 5.1, Latin 2S) Portuguese (2.0) German (5.1) and Italian (5.1) Also includes commentary by Directors Tim Burton and Joel Schumacher.    Overall Score 8.5 out 10
142311339X|5.0|PJVs QUICKIE POV:<br />Even though I haven't gotten very far in the Percy Jackson series (Book 1 is about it), for some reason I was really drawn to reading The Lost Hero. Probably because of the age. I have a hard time reading below the age of 15 or so, the characters are a bit too immature for me to relate to. I enjoyed PJ's Lightening Thief but hadn't gotten the will to move on to the next book. I'm a sucker for teen angst and smoochies and it doesn't happen until they get a bit more into puberty. That being said, The Lost Hero is set in the Percy Jackson time line and the characters are nicely aged at the 16/17 range. They are mature and a bit war hardened. The time period is after the Titan War but we usher into a whole new set of heros. Riordan did an amazing job of making this completely believable without us all going WTH? If you like the Percy Jackson world, or if you want to try it out for the first time, this is a great companion and start.<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />Jason comes to awareness on a bus of misbegotten teens heading to an unknown location. He is holding hands with a pretty but rough-around-the-edges girl and a five foot tall man stands at the front of the bus glaring at him as if he ate his dog. Jason can't remember a thing, he barely knows his own name and he certainly doesn't know the people around him. Thus, starts Jason's adventure. Wiped of memories, Jason must come to grips with his half-godliness, the fact that everyone seems to want to kill him, a best friend and girlfriend that he didn't even know he had and a mission to save the world. At the back of his mind lays a sneaking suspicion that this isn't the first adventure he has been on and that he really shouldn't be trusting the people around him. Funnier still is his ability to speak latin and the tattoos and brands on his arm.<br /><br />New stories will unfold in the world of the heroes. Secrets unveiled and hidden agendas revealed. The story of Jason, Piper and Leo is epic and dangerous. The action is non-stop and the introduction to a new side of the Percy Jackson's world is very interesting. A must read for Rick Riordan fans and Young Adult aficionados with a penchant for the fantastical.<br /><br />RECOMMENDATIONS:<br />For young and old alike. Nothing to make parents wary, besides a bit of swordplay and ichor. Fans of myths and fantasy should enjoy. You can start at this book, even if you have not read the Percy Jackson series.n-stop and the introduction to a new side of the Percy Jackson's world is very interesting.

0393327655|5.0|This is a must read, believer or not.  The detrimental effects of religion on society and individual lives is something that can't be ignored without disastrous consequences.  To non-believers this book is a wake-up call that religious beliefs really do inform peoples' actions.  To moderate believers it is a rebuke of their codependent passivity in the face of fundamentalist rhetoric and action, and their wholly misguided protection of such malcontents.
0385341679|5.0|PJVs QUICKIE POV:<br />As conclusions go, I have never waited more patiently for the end, than I did for Shadowfever. Ever since I laid Dreamfever down (well no, I threw it across the room upon completion) I have been patiently awaiting Shadowfever. I have never looked forward to a book as much as I did this one. Was it worth the wait? The heartache of the last two books? The jarring pain that thrust through my head every time Barrons and Mac blamed each other and bitched and tormented themselves!? HELL YES.<br /><br />  This is the way the world ends<br />  This is the way the world ends<br />  This is the way the world ends<br />  Not with a bang but a whimper.<br /><br />Shadowfever, Mr. Eliot, did not end the Fever Series world with a whimper. It definitely was a bang. A big, wet and fulfilling bang. Take that however you feel is necessary.<br /><br />IF YOU HAVE NOT READ THE PERVIOUS BOOKS GO NO FURTHER! I have tried my hardest to not spoil Shadowfever...but it will spoil the earlier books.<br /><br />REVIEW:<br />The conclusion of the Fever series picks right up where we left Mac in Dreamfever. She had killed someone dear to her. Someone that meant the world to her and their death would change her life forever. I had my suspicions as to who this was...but I couldn't believe it. Couldn't process it at all. I had all these replacements stuck in there, but my mind would always go... `Why would Mac care that much?' KMM couldn't have done what I think she just did! You'll find out who it is within the first chapters (if you feel it necessary you can get those first two chapters on KMMs blog).<br /><br />Mac's world has become a dark place. She is trapped in the Silvers and she knows the LM is descending on her at any moment. She is now alone there, with no protection. She has to escape the Silvers and then still she must track and conquer the book all the while staying alive and protecting those that she loves. Her transition in Shadowfever is a hard one, Mac is no longer the Rainbow Girl she once was, but still desperately wants to retain some of her older self. With enemies popping up around every corner and secrets that put a death sentence on her head, will Mac be able to accomplish what she hasn't be able to in the past? Will she finally find out what happened to Alina and destroy the book? And most importantly will her and Barrons finally stop bickering and start kissing???<br /><br />Everything I ever wanted and more. KMM answered the questions I didn't even think to ask. Her imagination was so outlandish that I basically read through this book dumbfounded that it was really that good. She just paints pictures with her words. I didn't skim, I didn't hurry, I actually would reread paragraphs over and over again to soak it in (which is why it took me three days to read this baby). Her words and conclusions were just excellent and then she wrapped everything up nicely in the end. There was one little end that didn't have a bow on it...but KMM reassures that it is not necessarily The End in her Q&A sessions.<br /><br />All in all a great great great read.

B004DMIIVO|5.0|While some reviewers have compared Summer Wars to a Miyazaki type of work, Summer Wars really fills a space between Isao Takahata (Pom Poko, Only Yesterday, My Neighbors the Yamadas) and Satoshi Kon. Summer Wars has the pace and intrigue of Satoshi Kon but melds in a human side similar to Isao Takahata's more slice-of-life type works. The characters are warm and believable, the action fast paced, and you will fret and cheer along with a fantastic crew of characters in a fun to experience world.<br /><br />The story follows math nerd Kenji into the vibrant and chaotic family life of his classmate Natsuki just as the world goes crazy. A virtual program, OZ (think Facebook + Second Life and raised to the 5th power) which links much of life together, goes haywire because a hacker trying to ruin the world. Kenji and Natusuki's whole clan rush into action to save the day.<br /><br />Two intriguing themes in the film are (1) how digital life is both blessing and curse and (2) how something as old fashioned as family can never be done without. Both themes are played off each other as in a mix of the old, the new and the enduring in the face of the possibilities we create for ourselves, both good and bad.
B001LRJH0U|4.0|The premise seems simple, and one might think it stays that way, like a stilted sunset, throughout Appaloosa: a Marshall (Harris) and his Deputy (Mortensen) ride into town upon threats from a gang run by a crook who also happens to run the local hotel, Bragg (Irons), and it looks as though not only will Harris have a potential mess on his hands (capture, trial, plotted-escape, pardon thanks to President Chester A. Arthur), but may get the new girl in town (Zellwegger) who comes in as the local piano player. The only big complications in this set-up, aside from some fairly obvious twists and turns involving side-plots and searching and a minute with some local Indians, is that the Deputy may possibly have a crush on Zellwegger, or maybe it's just an honor thing. Either way, it becomes a subtly uncomfortable three-some.    Both Harris and Mortensen strike distinctive figures as part of a western landscape, and Harris knows this as director first. Without these two in the roles it could have been just some straight-to-TNT stuff, decent but nothing much to write home about unless a hardcore genre fan. Then again, mostly hardcore genre fans will really dig it, not so much those who think a Western is just 3:10 to Yuma and maybe, if they want to sound 'arty, The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford. But Harris, unlike even those two examples (and for the latter just as that's more ambitious if flawed), can't seem to strike a chord with the story to make it very much interesting past some quirks in the characters (i.e. Sheriff's running-gag in not knowing certain words) and a sorrowful last ten minutes. It is, more or less... dry. It should work better than it does, but a lot of it just rolls along, with its actors caught up in the 'simplicity' of it all.
B003L77TZI|4.0|Katy Perry pulls off a serious surprise on \\"Teenage Dream\\": she goes from low quality candyfloss to fine spun sugar cotton. Not only is this album song for song a better deal than \\"Me and The Boys,\\" the album is a pure-pop tease of silly sexiness, adolescent yearnings, girl-power can-do and a modern-pop hookfest. Granted, this is an album geared towards having as many hits and radio spins as possible, but sometimes a purely well crafted guilty pleasure can brighten a dull day. Katy Perry recognizes this truism and pushes it as hard as she can.<br /><br />Besides, there is no way to avoid the fact that both the title track and \\"California Gurls\\" are ear-worms of the highest caliber. She'd already learned her way around a good hook as songwriter before becoming a star, on \\"Teenage Dream\\" she increases the confidence and the firepower. While not the greatest of singers (and autotune rears its head a bit too many times), she uses enthusiasm and dramatic flair to bring the songs home.<br /><br />She's also unafraid of doing purely dumb songs, which never hurts a flirty image. \\"Peacock\\" is her answer to \\"My Humps\\" or even the X-rated niece to the long ago \\"Mickey\\" by Toni Basil. \\"ET\\" is the miss in that division, as there are too many forced metaphors to make the joke work as novelty. It's also hard to balance this kind of contorted silliness with the 'serious' songs (\\"Circle The Drain\\" and \\"Pearl\\"). Bragging that you want to see a guy's pea-cock-cock-cock undercuts the intended message of the strong willed woman urging her girlfriend to dump the abusive creep in \\"Pearl.\\" Well done confections like \\"Firework\\" and even the melodramatic \\"Not Like The Movies\\" (which sounds like it means to be Katy's version of Pink's \\"Glitter In the Air\\") are endearing without sounding schizophrenic in the context of the whole album.<br /><br />Yet who am I to say. While I enjoy the choco-pop-ice cream that is \\"Teenage Dream,\\" the teen girls dreaming of stardom and empowerment will likely think \\"Pearl\\" is dead on, and that is where Perry gets her juice. The bulk of the songs are top-notch (don't believe me? Find the Glee rendition of \\"Teenage Dream\\" and tell me it's not a glorious bit of songcraft). Much like Cyndi Lauper before her, Katy Perry is making the best of her individuality, her sense of fun and her genuine talents., and that is where Perry gets her juice.

B00003CXA2|5.0|I think that the best movies are those that you 'appreciate' or understand after seeing it more than once. However, with 'forrest gump', i fell in love with it after the first 15 minutes and knew it would be in my top 10 straight away.    It is so unique because of the character Forrest Gump himself, who has a low IQ of only 75. Although he is 'mentally challenged', he finds himself in historic and troublesome situations and like that he manages to 'forrest gump' his way out of it and end up a hero or role model. but the real beauty in this movie to me was his ability to simplify the complexities of the world we live in and somehow do what some war movies fail to do. show the importance of world peace or what love movies can't deliver...the importance of love.    I love that Forrest doesn't lose his innocence and purity throughout the movie, or maybe he just can't but either way, this shows you don't need to be evil or really intelligent to be recognised or successful. Then again it is just a movie (and a very good one too). So maybe it doesn't work like that in reality. what that simply means is that the acting and story of this film was incredibly touching on a real level. And in my definition that's what a good movie should be able to do.    Every award the movie received was well deserved especially Tom Hanks. Now that's an actor for ya. I love this movie and don't hesitate to give it a 10.
0743490304|5.0|Believe it or not, this is actually my favorite Dan Brown book! I think it has more action than Angels & Demons, The DaVinci Code or even The Lost Symbol. I love that it takes place in the arctic with all of the special forces from the military. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat! I definitely recommend this book to anyone who likes action-packed thrillers!
B0036EH3U2|1.0|I finally got to season 4 and what happens the season 4 bluray disk do not play. Season 1, 2 and 3 did fine but none of the season 4 disk played.

0679745203|1.0|Okay so this is not intended to be a realistic novel. It is a fable. In a fable trees are allowed to talk and frogs become princes. One of my very favorite books, \\"Catch-22\\" is a fable. Thus the author is entitled to expect us to suspend disbelief at all the numerous implausibilities.<br /><br />Usually fables, like \\"Catch-22,\\" are written in absurdist style. That tells you up front that you're not supposed to take it seriously. I think that some of the previous negative reviews have been misled into thinking that Ondaatje intended to be literal.<br /><br />The visual descriptions are strong. I could see the villa, the bedroom with the patient lying supine and nude, the fountain.<br /><br />I could not see any of the characters. In the modern style, few descriptions are given, but I haven't had this problem before, not even with Leonard and DeMille who would sooner commit hara-kiri than tell you anything about a character's appearance.<br /><br />Hana was the only character who had any character, perhaps because she seemed sexy and I'm a dirty old man.<br /><br />Heinrich Dahms, the indie movie producer and my critical lodestone, insists on \\"a bitch of a dramatic dilemma.\\" I couldn't see any dilemmas here, nor drama. It was all pretty tame. People floated around pointlessly and made mundane utterings.<br /><br />About a third of the way into the book I realised that I was not enjoying it. The mostly plain prose, which I would otherwise have admired, only described the characters being flat and boring.<br /><br />Elmore Leonard says that he leaves out the parts which the reader skips over. If Ondaatje had done that here, he could have ended up with quite a tantalising short story.<br /><br />The entire premise is just too thin for me. I regret giving up so many hours of my life to read this book when I could have been doing something useful.
B001HBX91S|2.0|A poorly patched up melée of presentations of uneven quality, far, far from what I had expected to be not only a jewel box of top performances but a blu-ray showcase.        This is my first Amazon purchase that turned out to be a dud. (Except for the luminous, alas so short, glimpse of the Magic Flute.)
