B003TOMAPC|4.0|I was not expecting much thinking that this would simply be just another dumb teenage action movie dumbed down so that the typical teenager would enjoy it for nowadays most Hollywood action movies are dumbed down so as to appeal to the 12 to 15-year-old male demographic which for somebody of my age being 51 years old find it normally absurd and a complete waste of time but I found this movie to be extremely entertaining and shockingly violent and at least it was not cookie cut out of the same pattern as so many other movies where it's stars are young for this is at least in my opinion a very original action movie and if you can't find an action movie today that is anything but the same old same old then you've got something worth watching.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|One if the most unique games ive ever played. I cant wait to play the next one! Play this NOW.
B006S08RLU|5.0|I am not a movie reviewer nor am I proficient in the art of reviewing anything like a movie so I will not attempt too other than to say that I am a 51-year-old male who normally does not watch &#34;art-house&#34; or independent type films for I am a typical guy that normally never watches anything where I have to read English subtitles with the exception of only a couple like letters from Iwo Jima being the exception and this one which I found extremely touching and funny and emotional and even a little tearjerking and coming from a guy like myself who is into your typical guy movies to where if something is not shot or blown up within the first 5 min. of the movie I lose interest,  I found this to be enjoyable enough as to purchase this on Blu-ray and add it to my personal collection although I will have to hide this movie so that when my other male buddies come over to watch the game they do not see it otherwise they will never let me hear the end of it.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I was compelled to watch the entire season in just a few long sittings!  Can't wait to order season two!
B00BWJARHO|3.0|It skips nothing and actually adds scenes that aren't described in the book, making for a very slow moving movie.  It is also much darker than the book.
B00BF2RTO2|4.0|Good quality dvd, good quality performance.<br /><br />I only give it 4 stars because I think that the more modern live dvds are better (except Death on the Road).
B00C0NWETA|5.0|Listening to the instrumental versions gives you an additional perspective of how great this album is. Kudos to Tobi and all the musicians that participated!<br />Great masterpiece! Can't wait for the next 2 releases of this theme!<br />Hopefully the lead time will not be a mystery...
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This is GREAT!  You can customize all your different books and keep different books for different subjects.  Keeps things well organized.  Only wish you could LOCK the books.
B00358ESI4|5.0|Not a date night movie, but a great war movie. It doesn't try to tackle the big picture, but rather tells the story of a single battle in the Vietnam War. If you like war films, you'll enjoy this.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I love being able to actually read all of the status updates that ALL of my friends post.  On the regular computer I tend to get distracted, but other than NOT being able to start playing the games, you can do and see EVERYTHING!!! Love it!!
B00BHMF578|4.0|You know how the movie ends, but it still keeps you guessing until the last minute. And while it may feel like a Jack Ryan movie, it's not... I think...
B006R1T40I|4.0|The long wait since Bonnie's last album was worthwhile. There is not a bad song on the entire disc. Her voice and guitar playing belie her age

B00COGZ8FU|3.0|Husband seemed to like it.  Too much violence for me.  I like action with Tom Cruise, but this was relentless.
B00CRWJ7VC|4.0|I don't know what I expected, but what I got was definitely not it. The first hour or so of Cloud Atlas was confusing -- but once the characters solidified in my mind, the last two hours made more sense.  I'm thinking of watching it again to see if I can follow it more.<br /><br />What I liked was the cinematography, the variety of characters, and the range of acting ability required by the leads.  I also loved some of the references (&#34;Soylent Green is People!&#34;).  I'm still not sure I understand the &#34;plot&#34; of the movie, but the message was clear -- and worthwhile.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|It is graphically a nice movie and the references to old video games are entertaining. In the end it gets a little cheesy for my taste.
0785163174|5.0|It was a great book at a great price! If you get a chance get one! I loved the hardcover version, and it was in Mint condition!!
B0045I3EJC|4.0|Very interesting but do your homework on the subject before so you can follow the story and understand the conclusion.
B0089LOG02|3.0|Not what I expected but enjoyable none the less. A little to neatly packaged for such a traumatic journey by these orphans
B006MI1GJI|3.0|I haven't finished reading the book, which I am enjoying. However, I bought this edition because it appeared to me that it included illustrations which are apparently important if you want to try to solve the case yourself. These were lacking. Maybe I needed to search for an edition that specifically said \\"Illustrated\\".  I almost have it just 1 or 2 stars because of that, but<br />it is cool that the audio (haven't tried it) and the Spanish translation are included, this bumping it up a star.<br /><br />If it had the illustrations, I would give it a 5 star rating because of all the included features for a low price.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|We like the new characters and their noises. The tasks are fun and tricky, but not too mind boggling. My six year-old and I have fun figuring them out.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|This book is pretty cool.I liked it because I like books that are made to seem like an actual diary are kind of super awesome.
B005SHTXN0|5.0|The movie speaks for itself.  Great classic.<br /><br />Video quality was impressive and fast. Very easy to use and free with Prime.
0802136834|5.0|Its so very interesting that I cant leave the book for a minute!!Alison is great ! I recommend it hotly!
B00C061I3K|5.0|That line in the title of the review is Paul Williams on track 7 of the album. And that's the sentiment. By quoting \\"I need something more\\" I don't mean to imply that the album does not deliver. Just the opposite. The album is so fresh, so new -- though it situates itself in disc/funk/soul/R&B/bit-of-new-wave of the 70s and 80s -- that it tells its contemporaries: We are still Masters. There is no end to creativity, to new ideas, to fun. Daft Punk prove that an album that \\"retreads\\" old styles can be so enjoyable, so fresh and new and wonderful. They are not the first of-late bands of course to delve back into those decades. Many have been channeling the 70s and 80s. Those like Neon Indian, Psychic Ills, Unknown Mortal Orchestra, Tame Impala, Chromatics, John Maus, Blouse, Holy Ghost!, M83, Cold Cave, Twin Shadow have been channeling the period between the late 70s and early 80s. Daft Punk have taken us a little further back in time, into a different music pocket, reminding us just how exciting that music still can be.<br /><br />Daft Punk continue to be important. If everything is old and new is just reinterpretation, then Daft Punk have done it here.
B009R659L8|5.0|I could hardly put the kindle down Mary Higgins Clark is a<br />must read on all her books. (I have not rated Secrets from the Past I have not finished the book will do it later)<br />The story of Daddy's Gone A Hunting kept me reading at least 6 chapters every time I picked it up!<br />I always look forward to her new novels as a first rate choice for me.  Every time I load new books  to<br />my kindle she among other's are my author's of choice
B004YW4L5K|5.0|I love Mr. Gaiman's work, and American gods is a great example of his magnificent writing style and characters.<br />Shadow has seen and done a lot of things, but nothing can compare to what he discovers along the way to the final showdown of new versus old.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|The best game ever!! Can not wait for the next one. The graphics are great and the game are fun. Best money spent on a game!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This was a great season and I loved the ending.  Can't wait for fall to see season four - five months to gol.
B002L7O7XG|2.0|I was not able to see these dvd's because they where for region 2 and I live in region 1. I sent them back for my refund.
B009NY43NY|2.0|I was pretty disappointed with the finale. I have been reading this series since before the show was even thought of, and have grown fond of the characters. I feel as if there are too many loose ends to be tied up. This would have been a great series to have a \\"ten years later\\" section in the last book. Also the ending \\"suspense\\" part was dismal to say the least. I am extremely sad this series is over, but it was not the ending I would have chose. While I am happy with the significant other she ended up with, I would have loved to read more about it.
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Hours and hours of entertainment for the entire family to enjoy from 1 1/2 to 44 years old! Keep them cheap! Keep them coming!
B00338QENI|5.0|I thought I'd get a story of Henrietta and how her cells became so important to science, but there was much more information within. Extremely interesting, and disturbing - much left to debate on the subject...
B005MLOKXA|5.0|A must see.. Mother wife lawyer entangled web of deciet and power of forgiveness and finding line and a life worth fighting for
1451695195|3.0|Bought the book for my wife, she will be the reviewer for this book, however, she didn't read it yet.
B00427X9WI|5.0|I love this movie! I didn't see it for a long time because of bad reviews, but when I finally did, I had to have it!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie you owe it to yourself to take time out. Wonderful piece of art.<br />Enjoy it!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Not my favorite game.  It is fun, but the tiles are so small on my Iphone.  Quick game when needed.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|At first I almost didn't watch this movie because of all the negative reviews.  I chose to watch it anyway and I am glad I did.  I was hooked with the very first scene and couldn't stop watching until it finished.  I was left with regrets that the movie didn't continue beyond that point.  I realized this was a complex movie that I would need to watch again in order to catch all the nuances of the plot, story line and acting.  I watched it a second time the next day and enjoyed it even more than the first time.  After seeing the movie a second time I was even more confused by the negative reviews.<br /><br />This is a complex movie that engages your intellect as well as being immensely entertaining.  Just one example is the character Tom Hanks played through the different stories.  The way that character started as a bad doctor and ended up overcoming his karma as it were to save Hallie Berry in the final story was excellently played as an actor and as part of the story line.  The interweaving of the different stories through time was immensely entertaining.  The impact of decisions at one point in time on the rest of the stories and the rest of history was excellently portrayed.  This appears to be a very good illustration of the causality principle through effective story telling.<br /><br />For hard core scifi fans I would say this movie is destined to become a classic.  Some of the scenes in the movie are gritty so you will need to keep an open mind but the gritty scenes are necessary to show the impact of those events on history.  Minor events which most people would not object to would not have any kind of major impact on history or evoke the responses of the characters to put their reputations and even their lives on the line to stop that event.  Atrocities evoke strong emotions, that's a fact of life.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game, hate the ads.  Another developer's game crashed and I had to uninstall it and replace it.  No problems with this one.
B009NY43NY|5.0|Finally, a worthy book in the Sookie Stackhouse series. I have read all of them. A couple of them seemed to lack detail and depth. This book had both. I would have enjoyed a few more chapters. Perhaps a &#34;Five Years Later&#34; finish. If you like Sookie and her world, do not miss this one.
B00CRW2066|5.0|The National keep getting better with each album. It's rare to find bands that are brilliant, mature, and captivating. This album is all three. it's a gem.
B005LAII1C|5.0|how can you not love this movie!! and blu ray and dvd and digital and ultra violet (what is ultra violet?) oh well, we have been very happy with this
B00CDSVZHY|4.0|Very violent, with lots of 3-D blood spatter and bodies sprawled everywhere. I don;t recommend for young children (at home or in the theater).
B00746O3X8|4.0|I found this item on Amazon after researching the Cotton Carrier product, and I chose the Opteka carrier instead because it is much less expensive and received good reviews here.  I have found the front carrier easy to adjust and prepare for carrying my Canon 40D with a very large Sigma 150-500 lens attached.  While the Opteka system requires the use of the camera's tripod socket, I did not find this to be a problem in attaching my Sigma lens since it has its own tripod socket, freeing up the one on the camera for the Opteka carrier's device.  I am very happy with how much easier the front carrier will make it for me to carry my camera with the Sigma lens attached!  I also was able to attach another camera to the side holster without any problems, though I don't know whether I will use this feature regularly.  I felt more comfortable slinging the second camera across my chest and to the side using its regular neck strap, but this is simply a personal preference.  The side holster provided with the Opteka system works just fine and looks like it could also be used as a stand-alone carrier over a regular belt.  One thing to note, however, is that the Cotton system (which also uses the camera's tripod socket) offers an adapter plate (at an additional cost) that would be compatible with various tripod quick-release plates.  I would have liked this feature in the Opteka, but did not feel that it was worth the higher price of the Cotton system plus the supplemental adapter, so I've decided to keep the Opteka.
B009R659L8|4.0|Great new book from Mary Higgins Clark.  Typical surprise twists that will keep you guessing. Fast and enjoyable read.  Recommended!
B00B8M4IMK|4.0|I was looking for a car charger for my Nexus 7 and the Anker Charger came up among the items.  I drive a number of times from New Jersey to Jacksonville, FL and use my Nexus with TomTom and an HTC ARIA.  I usually use up the battery life of the HTC (anyone who has one knows that it is easy to do so) and in using my Phone Car Charger I also deplete the battery on the Nexus 7 which is also a problem since using it all sometimes creates horrors in the recharge.  The Anker seems to work with charging the phone and appears to not allow the Nexus to go completely dead.  I have not used them on the NJ-FL drive yet but will be doing so soon.  I'm cautiously optimistic.
B008NCSZQ8|3.0|This movie was a mess, there was no reason for two characters to even exist they just got in the way of the plot.  Which mind you the plot also was very thin to say the least.  I had no idea why people were fighting each other and there was no reason for the conflicts with the exception of loki.  Joss played it safe, which I can't blame him since this is a huge deal for marvel with several movies coming together for this one.  It just was not as impressive as everyone said it was.<br /><br />Bottom Line:  Good for popcorn, not a good scifi or Joss Whedon flick.
B002T9H2L0|1.0|Concentrate of absolute hatred and atrocities which satanism only matches grotesqueness, against the bad guys, here all in one basket : Nazis, regular Wehrmacht soldiers and even German civilians ... in the name of the Jewish persecution, which  H.Weinstein et R.Meyer, the almighty milionaire producers and president of Hollywood's Universal probably still suffer a lot.
1401307787|4.0|Good book, excellent quotes, excellent manner of looking at the world and great approach to mindfulness.  There were no drawbacks to the book and it was an easy and quick read.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|This DVD was received in timely manner. The product was just as described. I will definitely use this seller again. The movie was great and my grandson really liked it. It was entertaining and worth viewing again. (we had seen at the movie theater, so he wanted it to add to his library).
B006LSZECO|5.0|I couldn't put it down. Every time I thought I had figured it out, the plot would thicken. Great read!!!
B004U8VUUC|4.0|Movie is morbid but great cast of actors and since it is based on true story it adds to the mystery.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I STARTED TO WATCH IT BUT IT KEPT STOPPING.  I THINK WE SAW THE FIRST FIVE MINUTES AND GAVE UP.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love this game so much it is very awesome I finally got a dinosaur zoo. I crossed breed and made a Pegasus
B0083SBMBM|4.0|It was great. I like everything that Joss Whedon does, plus I'm a big fan of Robert Downey Jr. .
193700788X|2.0|This was my favorite book series ever until the last few books. I've read some of the reviews and I feel the same way most of them felt. Charlaine Harris had a rare, precious gem of a series. It was a fresh take on an old story line and we devoured it. She had a large following of loyal and devoted readers. And she has let us all down. This is how she ends her epic series?? Horrible, completely and utterly disappointed. The last couple of books were rushed and thrown together. I won't be buying another book from this author since I know how she's going to do us in the end!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is awesome!  My  amazing kids love it pay it until my batter light flashes on my kindle fire.
B008XKSW7M|3.0|The movie was just ok. I watched it while filing papers, and it was not so intriguing that I couldn't look away.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|I love angry birds friends so much! I play it every week and there are always interesting and challenging levels to play!
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Written and directed by J. J. Abrams and produced by Spielberg-- how could you have a movie less than thrilling and exciting.  Great for kids too--lots of young kids in it that witness an epic train derailment and the bizarre events that follow!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|I liked EVERYTHING about this movie - the story, the phenomenal acting, the scenery! Wish there was a Silver Linings Playbook Two!
B007KW5N9Y|5.0|Excellent Spielberg film that I (think) debuts Christian Bale's acting as a young boy--one of my favorite movies of all time!!
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|I love horror movies and loved this one.  I know it is not for everyone but if you are a horror fan, you should like this one.
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|Loved the movie!  It ranks up there with The Notebook, even though The Notebook will always be my all time favorite!
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Those that gave negative feedback seem to lack imagination. If you enjoy well constructed satyr, can imagine or hope that soul mates really are forever, and look beyond your local condition this is an excellent movie. The added bonus is the transformation of the key players throughout the movie, the past, present and future. The cast succeeds with convincing portrayals of multiple individuals whose souls and spirits remain intact. Kudos to makeup, special effects, writers and MUSIC makers!
B00005JMCN|5.0|No movie portragel of real life and what connecting with others really means can come close to this special story.  An excellent aid to understanding the need for healing to come from within COUPLED with what others can mean in our life, if we just keep our eyes and hearts open to finding such values!  Hope it is being used within the school systems to help, within age appropriate settings, to assist our young people to learn the valuable lessons historical non-fiction can offer!
B00CW665VI|5.0|What a refreshingly different read.  Tangled by Emma Chase is written in a man's point of view.  I was at first leery about this because I knew the author was female, but a can honestly said that I quickly forgot that fact, because she did such a good job giving the readers the male point of view.<br />I also enjoyed that Ms. Chase wrote the book in a way that the male character was talking to us, he was talking directly to the reader.<br />Drew Evans is a successful, rich good-looking man and he is a male whore.  He makes no bones about it. Drew is happy with his life until he meets his match in one Katherine Brooks. She is beautiful, smart and determined.  She doesn't fall for Drew million-dollar smile or his refined charm, that first night when they meet at a nightclub.  This is a first for our playboy, but he quickly moves on to his next conquest.<br />But after spending the week-end thinking about the beauty he meet and regretting not having pursued her, he is shocked to be introduced to his new associate a work, staring into Kate's eyes once again.  Drew has a strict policy, he doesn't mix work and play.  He never sleeps with someone from the office.<br />This is where the fun begins!  The verbal sparring between these two characters was fantastic. Some of the scenes where funny as hell, I couldn't stop laughing through most of the book, kept shaking my head saying, Yep that's a man for ya!  I loved watching Kate whole her own against Drew.  Whatever he can dish out, she serves right back at him!!!  Things become even more interesting when they are assigned to compete against each other for a big account at the investment Banking firm where they work.<br />I felt that Dawn and Drew had wonderful chemistry.<br />I totally enjoyed t Tangled and would highly recommend it to anyone who was looking for a romance book with a little something different.  I can see myself reading this book again and again.
1451695195|5.0|This book was far above what I expected....lots of &#34;stories&#34; being done...but this one was presented in a complete, realistic, and also a spiritual manner with enough &#34;down to earth&#34; detail to make it credible.  This isn't just another &#34;story&#34;....it coincides with all the health and medical research as well as very newest of developing energy medicine I am coming to an indepth knowledge and conviction of.  Tremendous balance of perspective is given through Dr. Alexader's words!

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is by far the best Sci Fi show ever made. It is a classic with its own unique taste. it is not one of those cheap sci fi shows or close to anything common at all. I wish they would make more of this series! It is ahead of its time and deserves more credit
1451688091|5.0|Goodwin is a superb researher and story teller. I acually read this simultaneously to her childhood baseball memior, 'Wait Till Next Year' and was amazed at her ability to relate any type of narrative. She skifully documents how Lincoln's rivals severely underesatimated the canny, street-smart (woods-smart?) lawyer and how he was so skilful at manipulating them to do what needed to be done. Lincoln also stands out as a most decent and usually likeable man, more than fit to be held as an American hero.
159102594X|5.0|This is the type of book that you cant put down and when you do all your thinking of is picking it up again!<br /> I loved it and the first book is better then the two after.(not that the next to are bad books they are great as well just not on the same level as this one). The characters are classics with so much personality and have a very realistic sense to them unlike many other characters you find in books.<br /> I love Logen Ninefingers and he alone is worth the entire book. Logen is by far one of my favorite characters of all time in all the books I have read and movies I have watched.<br /> Glokta is also great and reading his chapters are so engulfing and suspenseful!<br /> Jezal is great to I'll admit I hated him at first but eventually found myself falling in love with his character and story!<br />this book is a classic and if you need a refreshing book this is the one! it has everything needed in it humor, suspense, and a lot more.
B00006I53S|5.0|As a small town sports editor who has to shoot hsi own sports photos, this is my workhorse lens.

B00C061I3K|5.0|I have heard grumblings from acquaintances and the dance camp that they were a trite disappointed with Random Access Memories, but it is a work of such quality that really separates Daft Punk from the chaff...Instead of the usual clinical BPM that is flooding the airwaves, we have something wonderfully analogue and yet electronic at the same time. Admittedly, having grown up in the '70s and hearing your musical heroes - Nile Rodgers, Giorgio Moroder and Paul Williams (the cassette tape of the Phantom of the Paradise soundtrack was a cherished childhood playlist) all over again, sort of tips the scales for me, but it is also recognising the mastery that Daft Punk has vested in this project and how well thought out it is.<br /><br />Indeed, it has been a while since I had played a CD in its entirety - let alone listened to any music 3 days in a row. Picture the silly grin on my face when I heard Give Life Back To Music and Nile Rodgers' guitar licks for the first time...and the sheer joy of recognising Paul Williams' voice and the pure musical heaven of Touch.<br /><br />Daft Punk know their Homework and the creativeness of their earlier output then can easily beat many in the market today hands down. Musique still sounds amazingly fresh despite being 17 years old. While their later releases saw them developing as artists, with Discovery being a major fan-favourite, there were times when their musical references became too obvious...and a nagging feel that they were trying too hard. 10cc? check. The Buggles? check. Peech Boys? check. Go make your own list. Human After All - the proverbial difficult third album, however, didn't do much for me.<br /><br />Then came the truly wonderful Tron masterpiece where they redeemed themselves many many times over, and then this album. In a sense, RAM can be seen a sequel to Discovery, but in a more organic way, where they continue to reinvent their craft. The tracks flow into one another and the sound quality is truly marvellous.Do justice to it, play it on a good audio system or good headphones. Better still, download the 24bit/88.2kHz hi res files.<br /><br />It's an irony that two vocoder-singing robots can actually sound more human than the plethora of mass produced auto-tuned music out there.<br /><br />Lose Yourself To Dance. Make Contact.<br /><br />Best Album of the Year.

B009IJJ5B4|4.0|This American reimagining of Sherlock is surprising, clever, and quirky.  Lucy Liu takes a surprising and impressive turn as his grounded companion, Watson.  Johnny Lee Miller is quirky, witty, not as menacing as BBC's Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock - but just as brilliantly neurotic. This reiteration takes interesting turns & bold choices.  *Love* it.

B0060MYKTY|2.0|After enjoying the Tudors&#34; I was expecting some intense writing and directing. The story, acting, sets etc. are all there. However this adaptation did not grab me and pull me along. I felt that it is rather limp. It is definitely lacking something. I don't know what but it is definitely lacking !!! I did watch and feel the same about season one and was hoping season two would somehow improve. But &#34;NO&#34; !!!  &#34;BIG TIME NO&#34; !!!

1451650728|5.0|David Mack is without any doubt in my mind, the best of the Star Trek writers today.  A bold statement, I know, since there are so many good ones, but Mack just finds a way to take his writing to awesome levels that will make a fan have to finish the next page.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any spoilers, but Mack manages to mix in a great story about the Soong family of androids, a clandestine operation lead by Worf and a cat and mouse game with a hostile warship trying to find Picard.<br /><br />All Star Trek fans should read this book.  I can't wait to start the next in this series.  The show and movies of the Next Generation and it's spinoffs may be off the air, but these books by Mack and his peers are even better than the TV show's most times.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I really really loved this book! It has to be my favorite read of 2013. It is fun, flirty, and hilarious.<br /><br />Drew is the best main character ever. There is nothing about him I didn't like and I loved Kate. She is his perfect match. She is no nonsense and awesome.<br /><br />I love books with cute little kids and Mackenzie is adorable! I also like his sister Alex. My only complaint about this book is that it ended.<br /><br />Highly recommended! Originally story, excellently written, and so so much fun to read!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|Witty, light-hearted, and fun book.  &#34;Easy Reading&#34;: breezed right through it.  Will definitely be looking into more works by the author.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I couldn't put this book down.  The book was told by two different characters.  I laughed and cried.  I didn't want the book to end.  This is a must read!
B0047Y0FGY|4.0|If you like Tina Fey then this book is for you.<br />Otherwise I don't know why you'd be looking this up in the first place.<br />Even if male readers can't personally connect with all of her anecdotes, they can certainly still appreciates the brand of humor they spawn.
B0097HSS4M|4.0|I enjoy this app and know I will use it a lot. I  know I will buy other programs from this group. I look forward to seeing what other apps they have to help with my camera editing.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Very addictive and fun at the same time! The neck cracking sounds so real can<br />Almost feel it. Best free game I've downloaded.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is very addictive! Lol it takes a few round to get enough daily tokens to truly enjoy it but it's well worth it! The game does freeze up occasionally(not all the time) but it's Windows based so of course it's going to at times. Love the game. I have downloaded others since this started my bingo addiction but deleted the other. None of the compare to bingo blitz.
B0042EJD8A|5.0|I knew little about the specifics of fracking until I watched this informative, but disturbing, documentary by Josh Fox. If the American people heed his warning in time he will have accomplished a great service to out nation. But arrayed against him are the likes of Dick Chaney (who made this disaster possible), the gas company executives who will fight responsible clean air and water practices to the bitter end, and the politicians who pander to them.<br />Sure, his filming is low budget and unpolished but his interviews with the people who are already suffering from a fracking-poisoned environment had a strong impact. Their dignity under great duress made me proud. He is very convincing in making his case that the ills they now suffer from degradation of their local environments will soon spread East if the practice goes unchecked in the New York City watershed in NY and Pennsylvania. And it might just touch the rest of us if we remain uninformed and complacent.<br />We do need US natural gas as a transition fuel, but not at this cost!
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book really makes you think about life, and how lucky we are to have as many choices as we have.  Worth reading again and again!
B000JQU4TW|4.0|I thought it was a good book and I enjoyed reading it.  Look forward to reading more by the same author.
B0009P42S2|5.0|I just wanted this movie in my collection. I saw it and this movie is great. The shipping and condition on it is good.
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|my 4yr old can't really play this by herself as there's a bunch of reading/instructions that pop up and she needs us to read them to her.  Why isn't there sound?
B00CWVGBEO|2.0|If I were in seventh grade this movie would be AWESOME! But I'm not and it isn't. It's a hacky, dumb, hot-wheels kind-of-movie. You know? Hot wheels? Like all the cars crash and jump through hoops and the Lego guys shoot 'em down? Yeah, it's like that. The movie takes forever to get going - lots of setup for the crash-em-ups later... like a fat guy parking his sweet ride in a no parking zone. Hmm... I wonder if that'll come back later in the movie? Or Johnny Knoxville playing Tim Conway shooting a big gun with Arnold... wonder if someone's gonna get shot by that big gun? Oh, the suspense.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|very colorful graphics and neat underwater sounds. my little one loves to watch the fish swim! i highly recommend for kids. 4 stars!
B00CKJTOHO|3.0|Rambling, lots of story lines, no big villain in this season... Still, it's Dexter - pretty much what you've come to expect by Season 7.
B000IDGBWU|4.0|A much better movie than most will give credit for, I think all the main charaters were done quite well.<br />One little quibble with the story is that in '63, there was NO such grinding,&#34;Dirty Dancing&#34; going on, but it is true that, at that time, rock and roll dancing was looked down upon. Still, a nice look at a more innocent time period.
B000002RXS|3.0|It's hard to hate on such a great recording of Bizet's masterpiece, but I cannot stand Maria Callas's voice.  I know that she was considered by many to be the greatest soprano of her era; but to me her voice sounds big and ugly.  Everything else about the album is well done.  If you're a fan of Callas you'll like this, otherwise stay away.
B003730LRY|5.0|The movie is perfectly cast, from the Parents, right down to Cristina Ricci as Wednesday Addams. This is one of my favorites.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Downloaded this game for my daughter but she never played it. Started playing it myself this weekend and I'm hooked! I'd like some friends though so we can help each other expand and earn rewards. My reef name is rose111308, email is larkincc@yahoo.com. come find me and let's play! -Catherine
B0022Q8CSC|4.0|This book is good. Its like the movie but with more detail. What I like about this book is the way the writer flows. It makes for easy reading and got me interested enough to start reading the follow up book The Sicilian of which I just started. I recommend this Mafioso story line classic.
B000E1MXSW|5.0|A Nun's Story is one of my favorite movies, one I never tire of.  The story is excellent, the settings beautiful,  Ms. Hepburn luminous as Sister Luke, and the impeccable performances of Edith Evans, Peggy Ashcroft and Mildred Dunnock are just frosting on the cake.  Too bad Hollywood has forgotten how to make thought-provoking films like this one.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|The movie has great visuals, characters, and actions, but weak ending in that was setting the scene rather than doing.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was one of my favorite books! With Auggie and Jack and Via the only bad beans about this book was Julian
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|This is one of the best adventure movies of all time. filled with thrills and awesome CG affects that make it seem like your in middle earth yourself!!!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|Enjoyed this movie loved the fact that i could watch it with all my family and no child had to be left out, thank you for that, the movie was good for me love story good for my husband with action very happy
B000HAB4KS|5.0|You never know what will happen next and after you start watching you can't stop. If you haven't seen this movie you have to!
B00CL50LEC|5.0|GREAT!!! it waw awesome and amazing.. it was good quality and no interrupions were present. would reccomend this to friend
B001KWTBQQ|3.0|Compared to today's animated movies this thing looks like looney toons. But it was cool that they had some of the old Star Wars caricatures in the movie.
B003Y5HWJU|1.0|disc not working..showing blank disc...this product should have been previewed before shipping...showing disc error then it shows not disc..bad disc
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Good movie, better than the first in my opinion! Action and drama just like the 1st one was like. Not much else I can say.
B00321GTJU|5.0|The planet Earth series is the best series ever. It is just incredible, the photography, the cinematography, the colors, the whole experience. Absolutely wonderful.
B006VZS1EA|5.0|This movie rocks! Very interesting story and different from anything I've seen! Awesome acting and just a great action packed movie!
B00BF123WG|2.0|Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzz. Just sooooo slow. Boring. Over acted. TOO LONG. And are we really supposed to believe this really happened like this? Really just hated it, so did my husband and (adult) kids, so it wasn't just me. If this is the best they have for an academy nomination, we are really in trouble artistically.
B006Z7XNVK|5.0|Haunting film that will stays with you. I watched it three times and learned something new everytime. I would highly recommend.
B00C1BU7V8|3.0|This was NOT what I had hoped, it dragged,  the story was historically inaccurate, and what bothered me the most was that Sally Field, while a great actress, was soooo miscast it was laughable. She should have portrayed his MOTHER or grandmother, not his wife, it really threw everything off. Sigh. Luckily it was just a rental, if I had paid $14 to see it I would have been really upset.
0375842209|5.0|I loved the various conceits that Zusak uses to tell this story: from the point of view of death, with foreshadowing, word definitions, out-and-out spoilers, backwards and forwards in time. Nicely done. The tale was nuanced, with themes like good vs. evil, coming of age, love vs. hatred, etc. The more I read about Zusak's thinking on writing this book and the sources of his inspiration, the more impressed I became. I loved that he was looking for a way to tell something about ordinary Germans living in the midst of such evil and the idea of turning the notion that death is a friend of war on its head. I was intrigued by his having the coming-of-age naïveté of the main character in juxtaposition with what was really going on fascinating. Lastly, I was intrigued by the books - or at least, book titles -- he chose to sprinkle throughout the story. My main complaint was that some of the characters were fairly one-dimensional and that the ending is entirely too happy to be believable. But I concluded that the richness of the writing and the story lines made this book deserve a full \\"excellent\\" rating from me.
B00CL66FEQ|5.0|This is not Gone With The Wind, it is a cute, enjoyable little comedy that is well acted and totally delightful. Barbra Striesand is such a great actress, I had forgotten that until I saw this, and Seth Rogen was very good too. It was not too long, the jokes were funny, and I can't imagine not enjoying it. It is exactly what it says it is.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Finally a movie that we all can sink our teeth into!!!!  This one is a MUST see for everone, folks!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|If you can struggle through the first 100 or so pages, you will be glad you did!  I nearly put this book aside several times as just too tedious, boring, and juvenile.  50 of those 100 pages should have been edited out, but they are the foundation for understanding the why the hero was able to survive being abandoned on Mars.  Hang in there until the folks on Earth come into the story line.  Most of the 1 star reviewers didn't make it that far.
B00CM96A60|4.0|I would really give it 3.5 stars but definitely 4 before I give it a 3. Has some really good songs and them some ok songs
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Does exactly what it claims it will.  I use it every day.  intuitive Interface.<br />And it is good looking.  Used it for several months now.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This artist truly blew my mind away. It is something fun, something different, and something awesome. I highly recommend it
B002WV5A9G|5.0|Great movie and story line that isn't offensive to the stories we've come to know in Star Trek already.  The cast is great definitely check it out!
B007W4OZ76|1.0|One of those workarounds that was supposed to make Dropbox for Androids work. In trying to make Dropbox work on my Kindle Fire, I ended up downloading 4 apps, non of which worked. I have Dropbox on my IPhone and it works great with no ADD ons.  Deleted all of these worthless workarounds
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I read the Iron Man and Captain America comic books and I was blown away by this fantastic movie.  If you haven't seen it yet, you owe it to yourself to watch it!
B00BQXWH2O|5.0|Shivers, son, shivers! Glorious harmonies, violins, professional album. Glad to see Armin is continuing to deliver this type of music, keep going!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Drew is all that I love in a jerk hero: cocky, full of himself, brash, egotistical, too handsome for his own good, but, worst of all, he's a man-ho. And I so don't really go for that guy, not at all, even if it is fiction. I prefer jerk over womanizer any day, but this author did something magical with Drew. She really did. She made me love him, care about him, and want to see him redeem himself. And Drew does do that, in a big, sweet way. Not only do we see all the questionable sides of Drew's personality, we also see that he is charming and endearing and ultimately lovable. I think when a man like this does fall in love, he falls very hard, and that makes reading that hero's story much more enjoyable and much more romantic to me.<br /><br />I loved the chemistry between Drew and his Kate. They argued, they bickered, they flirted, and it was great to read. I loved the verbal foreplay, and I was just waiting for that charming womanizer to get knocked out by love. Not only is this a sweet and sexy read, with some very sigh-worthy romantic moments, and some great groveling as well, this story is also incredibly funny, the kind of laugh-out-loud funny that makes people ask you what you're reading over there. This story is told in first-person completely from Drew's POV. I love having the male point of view in a romance, and here that is all we get, all Drew, all the time, go big or go home. He holds nothing back, no ground too sacred, no truth untold, no secret not confessed. He tells the reader everything, and it was refreshing, unique and hilarious.<br /><br />I think the author did an outstanding job voicing this male character. Drew felt real, he sounded real, and he was this story, front and center. I loved him. As I read his male POV, all his tidy insights, all his guy thoughts, I laughed, I cringed, I gasped, I even agreed at times, and then I laughed some more. I lost it over the black-olive incident at Thanksgiving dinner, and the \\"What would William Wallace do?\\" speech!, and Billy roaring up in his Totally 80's T-bird; just one funny thing after another, either worthy of a chuckle or a straight-out, snorty laugh. Some of what Drew says is crude, maybe even offensive, but I mean, really, he was funny. Yes, not PC all the time, but I have to say the guy was spot on most of the time for me.<br /><br />The writing is smooth but sharp, effortless and easy to read, just very clever, fresh and fun from page one. I was caught up in the story, the character, the humor, and the romance. This author perfectly balanced the rom with the com; nothing felt short-changed to me. If this is a debut book, well, I don't know what to say, except maybe, when's the next one? And will the fantastic Dee-Dee get her own story? I sure hope so. TANGLED is going right on my keeper shelf, under 'books that make me happy.' This book made me feel good, made me laugh and smile, and it made my heart feel lighter and my mood brighter. Big smile and big love for this hero and his story. This was an awesome read. Loved every minute of it!o?\\" speech!, and Billy roaring up in his Totally 80's T-bird; just one funny thing after another, either worthy of a chuckle or a straight-out, snorty laugh.

B0071XO8RA|4.0|It was not like FIVE books, just like five episodes making up one book.  But I enjoyed that one book.  Glad I didn't buy them individually though.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Smallville is definitely one of my all time favorite shows!  I would definitely recommend getting the complete series because all the discs are in one container plus you get special features etc on the discs.<br /><br />My complete series arrived quickly and was in perfect condition, I would definitely use this seller again! : )
B001PU8N0I|5.0|I recommend this to everyone who likes costume dramas. BBC does the most fantastic job of staying true to the book. This is long and there is much sadness but hey it's Dickens. The acting is just superior. I have watched it many many times (in bits and pieces)
B000U6BT40|5.0|The episode was crystal clear, a great episode/show by the way!  I love Instant Video and would definitely suggest to others!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I just love this costume drama. BBC has just nailed it with this one. It is long and has much sadness but such a fantastic story line.<br />The acting is unbelievably good. There is more than one scene that is just so breathtaking.  For historical content you won't fond anything better on the industrial revolution in England.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is my absalute fab game ever.totality cool worth a million dollars i love it so much but it could use more surprise boxes.
B00COGXX7A|5.0|Enjoyed it very much similar to sleeping with the enemy. Fresh faces some familiar from revolution it movies along quickly and was enjoyable.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft PE is one of the best games out there. This one believe it or not was my first minecraft game ever. The game is so fun I ever bought minecraft for my Xbox 360 and for PC. Buy the game and you will not be disappointed!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Addicted to Suits! What's not to love? Great cast, great plot and storyline. Plowed through Season One in a few days.
B00B0NDF26|3.0|I expected much better from T & S, but don't get me wrong, it is still the best thing going so far.  There's so little out there  that after a while it segues itself.  I would buy more from T & S, but I only found the two CD's listed.  More Please??
B004TI1WME|4.0|I like this app because is very handy and easy to use. It works nicely on my Kindle Fire. I use it to keep track of my budget when going to the supermarket; I can write down the name of the products I buy on the tape mode of the calculator, so I can check how much I have spent so far.
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Fun movie to watch on ROKU. Some over acting but always enjoy Barbara Streisand on the big screen. Seth Rogen played part well.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I think this app is okay. It looks nice, it has a lot of options to navigate on my Facebook account, the interface is easy to use, but what I don't like is the fact that I always have to wait a long time for the app to refresh. Refreshing and updating processes are too slow; they take so long that I usually get mad so I end up quitting the app. I do not use it anymore, because it is faster to check my account using the web browser of my Kindle Fire.
B0064W639K|5.0|A compelling story between good and evil, where the hero has just as dark of a past as some of his villains. The writers of this one bring these characters to life in a very refreshing way that is sure to please everyone
B003VANOFY|5.0|I'm sure there are more amazing headphones out there, but these are the best wireless headphones I have ever used.<br /><br />PRO:<br />Easy/fast setup<br />Decent range<br />Price<br />Sound quality<br />Rechargeable (even while your PC is off if your motherboard supports it)<br /><br />CON:<br />Slight distortion under random circumstances (cell phone rings while in my pocket as the microwave is running on popcorn setting)<br />7.1 surround seems meh, but that might be user error on my part<br /><br />Overall this is a decently priced set of wireless headphones. They seem to be worth the price so far.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Real music, this is it. One the best albums of the year no doubt, it lives up to hype. This album is an audiophile's dream with new nuances to be discovered on each every listen.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|Took me a little while to get used to the new sound, but I love it! Hayley sounds better than ever.
B00C061I3K|4.0|I'm a long time fan, over ten years, just like the other \\"long time\\" fans ;-)  My take is this album is a narrative on the state of current music, its all electronic with no \\"life\\".  If you actually listen, a lot of their older songs are also a narrative on society (Technology, television, etc...) Hence thisentire album being real and full of depth.<br />Yes the songs are slower and not as dance worthy as I would like, it is alarge dedeparture from all their work, but that was the point.  I'm sure we will get a more dance worthly remixed version in the future kids.  I am deffinetly disappointed in not some innovative dance music.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I loved this book...all her experiences, her concerns, what NOT to do...and the friendships on the trail.. What to do if you want to be prepared for female functions.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great use of the functionality tablets have to offer. Only takes a couple of hours but can't wait for the next chapter.
B003K16P3M|5.0|Kristin Cashore is my all time favorite writer. She captures and delivers her story with elegance that is heart warming and beautiful. Great read
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I cannot remember reading a book so interesting and entertaining. Just read it ASAP. You will not regret a single word.
B00CRWJ5GO|5.0|Excellent movie all the way through. Great storyline and wonderful actors. I would reccommend anyone over 13 that has 3hrs sit down, relax and enjoy this movie.
0060755598|5.0|Great audio book for start up small businesses that is still relevant to current times. Also this not abridged, so no content is lost.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have never read a book like this before. It is a fun, easy read but full of depth, beautiful imagery, and brilliant writing. I loved it!
B001EN71CW|5.0|this was purchased as a gift for my mom, she loves this show.<br />the price was excellent & for blue ray even!  the timely shipping<br />was a total added plus
B007TNQ7EY|5.0|It is better than Grand Theif Auto. It does have some foul language and profane stuff, but other than that, awesome.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|ok this app is bad. Because!!!! well it all started the other day...I was sitting on my bad playing the game when BOOOOOOM!!!!! MY WHOLE KINDLE FIRE FROZE AND IT WAS LIKE THAT FOR LIKE 6 HOURS. SOOOOO.....I WOULD NOT GET THIS APP IF YOU HAVE A KINDLE FIRE
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|This game is kind of addictive!  Its sounds impel to go smart faster... Never stop repeating a level until mastered, which improves the skill. Teaser!
B0000VCZK2|5.0|This collection is the best I've ever seen of the Alien Franchise :) It has two discs for each movie (one with two films (original and special edition), the other with special features) and a 9th disc of all the commercials, trailers, and TV spots for ALL the movies... This collection can't be beat, if you love Alien, seriously, this is the best thing for you!!!!!! And who could beat the price?? Now for the movies, Alien (directed by Ridley Scott) is a classic, it's scary and cool, and suspenseful. I love that movie. Aliens (directed by James Cameron) is even better!! Alien3 (directed by David Fincher) is the least loved of the franchise, but I still love it, it has a really important part of the story! THEN OMG Alien Resurrection (directed by JeanPierre Jeunet) is the coolest film of them all. It has the best plot, the best characters, the MOST aliens, the best cinematography, the best everything. It is a masterpiece and my favorite Alien movie (though that's hard to say because without the first, there wouldn't be the sequels!!) But seriously, if you love this franchise, get this set. YAY
0307716988|5.0|I only read a little bit of this book but I love it anyway it has some things about Michael I didn't know.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|Was funnier then I expected.  I absolutely loved the character played by Elizabeth Banks!  She did great! I teared up a little too.
B0030A0ZD4|5.0|This movie is better on Blu-ray. It has good quality and surround sound. When I first opened the package, I thought it was going to be in Spanish because the disc had Spanish language on it, thank God it wasn't. I really love this movie. It's filled with action and special effects. I first saw this movie as a kid and I did not know that they made videos for \\"Speed Demon\\" and \\"Leave Me Alone\\". A must buy for ALL MJ FANS!!!!
B00C061I3K|5.0|Perhaps its not the album that we all thought we wanted; but Daft Punk has never been one to give us what we THINK we want. When Discovery was released we were all disappointed it wasn't another Homework; Human After All wasn't another Discovery, etc. With RAM, Daft Punk have crafted a wonderful, creative, and innovative album; a journey that needs to be taken as a whole. It's also of the best sounding and produced records that I have heard in a long time. It's great, I love it; and I think that eventually it will be regarded as one of their best. Give it try, if it doesn't click the first go round, try try again :)
B008602KQI|4.0|if YOU HAVE NOT READ THE BOOK YOU MIGHT WANT TO AFTER THE MOVIE.<br />IT HAS ACTION DRAMA AND ROMANCE,KAT DOES WHAT IS RIGHT ,
B0060AY85C|1.0|This book was inflicted upon me as required summer reading prior to attending my university.  In fairness, the book is well crafted, engaging, and overall made for an easy read.  The story, however, is terrible.<br /><br />Toni Morrison (her nom de plume) is an 82 year old African-American woman.  The book could just as easily have been titled &#34;82 Years of Angst&#34;.<br /><br />Morrison is an extremely well educated and accomplished author who has received international honors (1993 Nobel Prize) for her writing.  Good authors will write about what they know.  Morrison knows how to be both black and female.<br /><br />If you want to read about fictitious black women, you'll love her work.  If not, may I suggest nearly any other author ever published.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Fit the kindle fire perfectly. Nice option to use as a bookstand. Hope to get many years out of it.
B000X1Z0BU|4.0|Remembered Glen Hansard from 'The Commitments', but knew nothing about his career.  Fun movie to watch and will certainly watch it again.
B002BVQU5A|4.0|Ah, to watch a young and lovely Depp in action, his talent is amazing.  There were other actors in the film, too, they were good...
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Not only was the acting superb the story line was captivating. There was never once a dull moment. It's a movie that you can laugh and cry watching.
B0017OB12O|4.0|This DVD arrived in good time and looks to be in good shape. I haven't had time to watch it yet but hope to soon.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|If you haven't watched in a while then get this version.  The blue ray production is well done and takes Braveheart back to the stunning classic it began as.
0307596885|3.0|As a long-time huge fan of Alice Munro, I hate to say how disappointed I was in this collection. But the stories were mostly bland and uninteresting. Many times I've been astonished and even moved to tears by Munro's stories, even though they often deal with unremarkable people living mostly commonplace lives (e.g., &#34;Child's Play&#34; from her last collection, &#34;Too Much Happiness&#34;). Here, though, the unremarkable and commonplace were mostly unleavened by the kind of understated yet compelling pathos that Munro usually brings to her stories. The big exception in &#34;Dear Life&#34; is &#34;Corrie.&#34; Yes, I kind of saw the twist ending coming, but I suppressed that vague foreknowledge, and was wonderfully surprised. Even fully anticipating the ending, though, one would still be impressed by how skillfully and poignantly it is written. So my advice is to pick up the book to read &#34;Corrie&#34; and then try some of the others without expecting the usual Munro brilliance.

B00BSWMITK|2.0|First of all let me say that I love Joe Satriani's work. He is my favorite artist of all time. I love his guitar style, technique and song writing. He is THE reason I began to play guitar.  I have been a fan for a long time. I have met him personally and enjoyed his concerts on the front row.<br /><br />As others have said, I always listen to new albums many times before forming an opinion.  After several listens, this one was, well, painful to listen to.  It seemed tired from the beginning.  There is nothing fresh or new about this album. Even the title is tired and borrowed -almost  \\"Yngwie'esque\\" (Unstoppable momentum = Relentless, Perpetual Flame, Spellbound, etc).<br /><br />Although the majority of the album is utterly forgettable,  this album does have a couple bright spots:  1) A door into summer and 2) Three sheets to the wind.<br /><br />A door into summer has no ground breaking guitar work but has a \\"hum-able\\" melody and sticks with you (one that would fit well on the some of his earlier albums) .  Although Three Sheets to the wind is not a guitar shred fest. The song really fits the title and adds a bit of humor to a rather boring album.<br /><br />I realize that this is just my opinion but this is by far Joe's weakest album to date.  It seems rushed, forced and burned out or tired.<br /><br />Just my 2 cents...

B00CW665VI|5.0|Hilarious view of life and relationships from a womanizer who gets bit hard by the love bug. Drew Evans is a spoiled, silver spooned love em and leave em man that makes no apologies for it. What he wants in business or in a woman he gets. That is until he meets Katherine Brooks.<br /><br />I totally applaud the author for bringing something fresh to the table. Reading a book totally from the man's POV was refreshing change, we got the good, the bad and the don't judge me look inside a man's thinking.<br /><br />If your looking for a new romantic comedy author that brings a much needed change to the formulistic romances out there give this author a try. I cant wait to read what's next from her.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is really fun because it gives you the freedom to try out different things on different tracks, and you get to experiment with which kinds of cars you want to use. Although a million coins seems like a lot to pay for a snowmobile in the game, you can earn the coins really quickly and the purchase is very much worth it.
0385474547|4.0|This is a great human interest story that details the tribal life of a man in middle Africa. The writing is very simple, clear and compelling. The story would appeal to anyone, it's a human story of family life, culture/values and the struggle to make a happy life for oneself. The plot moves along at the perfect pace and keeps you engaged and wanting to know more about this man's life. I highly recommend it!

0375842209|5.0|The novel The Book Thief, by Markus Zusak, fits into the historical fiction genre.  However it can also fit into the adventure or suspense genres as well. This book is mainly for people in high school or older and a good understanding of World War II is almost a necessity.  There are various tones in this novel because of the narrator's feelings and the protagonists feeling are constantly changing.  The story is narrated by Death and the story is told from his point of view. Some of the characters in this story include the main character Leisel, the Hubermann family who are her adopting parents and her friends Max and Rudy, and of course Death.  Overall I give this book a 9/10.  I loved how this book gave me a whole new perspective on the lives of Jewish and German families during WWII.  Zusak's theme of hop and life are clearly expressed throughout the novel and I feel like it was greatly written.  I love how the author connected the novel to many events that actually happened and made the characters part of those events.  I think that the author did an amazing job with this novel and I can't wait to see if the 2014 movie can match or even top this books greatness.  If there was one this I could change it would to be for Rudy to survive.  His death was probably one of the most depressing parts of this novel but it still was a great addition.  I would greatly recommend this book to all my friends and family and it is by far one of my favorite books that I have read.<br /><br />-Jake Estares

B00C061I3K|3.0|I don't really like doing many reviews for music because to me music, more than any other media, is the most subjective.  More than movies, books or video games it has the most subtle variations that can make people like or dislike certain songs, albums, artists or even whole genres.  NO music (or any other media for that matter) is truly good or bad, it's completely up to each individuals opinion that makes it so.  Two people can have virtually identical tastes, but still not completely agree on whether or not the same artist, song, etc. is good or bad.  For example:  I may like artist X, so friends or even the \\"Amazon suggestions\\" may recommend artists Y and Z since they are so similar to X.  I may like artist Y, but not Z.  Other people that also like artist X may like artist Z, but not Y; or neither!  So what I want to make clear to anyone reading this review is that I am just giving you my honest OPINION; agree or disagree, like or hate!<br /><br />All that said, I just want to throw in my 2 cents.  Right off the bat, NO, I don't particularly care for this album.  I am a fan of \\"Daft Punk\\" and have all their studio albums, I'm just not a die-hard fan.  To me, the \\"TRON: Legacy\\" soundtrack/album is their best work to date (best soundtrack EVER in my opinion!); with \\"Human After All\\", \\"Discovery\\" and \\"Homework\\" all coming in at 2nd place.  This album however comes in last place.  I didn't read ANY advanced reviews or anything for this album, so I had no idea what to expect, but I did expect it to sound SOMEWHAT like their previous albums (not T:L though)!  So anyone expecting this, like I did, will be sorely disappointed and I would recommend passing on this one.  If you are a big fan of \\"Daft Punk\\" and just have to get it, go ahead, but be prepared for a whole different experience!<br /><br />For a couple of exceptions, practically the first 9 tracks sound like they are straight from some 70's roller disco music mix!  Slow, bland and definitely NOT what I would define as electronica or \\"Daft Punk\\"!  I mean, except for some robot voice effects and some other, VERY FEW, electronica sounds it doesn't really even sound like \\"Daft Punk\\" at all!  Out of these first 9 tracks; the first, \\"Give Life Back to Music\\" and the eighth, \\"Get Lucky\\" are the only ones I found to be mildly enjoyable.  Maybe the third track, \\"Giorgio by Moroder\\" might be more of a hit if it wasn't for the commentary by Mr. Moroder; who I really have no idea who he even is other than what I heard in his commentary!  I get that \\"Daft Punk\\" got some of their inspiration from disco music (which comes across in their music), but I can't stand disco!  Which I guess is rather ironic since a lot of forms of modern electronica have their roots IN disco.<br /><br />After that, the last 4 tracks are a little better.  At least they move away from the \\"disco-esque\\" sounds of the previous 9 tracks.  \\"Motherboard\\" was a pleasant surprise, and although a bit slow, one of the better tracks on this album.  \\"Fragments of Time\\" was also pretty good, although, again, not your typical \\"Daft Punk\\" sound.  And finally, the last track, \\"Contact\\" I found to be the best track on the entire album.  Really, it is the only one that actually SOUNDS like the \\"Daft Punk\\" we're all use to!<br /><br />Honestly, I'm surprised that this album (as of the time I write this) has received so many 4 and 5 star reviews.  Most (if not all) are probably from die-hard \\"DP\\" fans who genuinely like the album or are just wanting to support \\"DP\\", but may not actually like it as much as \\"DP's\\" previous albums.  I gave 3-stars, which really, I'm being a bit generous.  To me, if I don't like at least half the songs on an album (which for this one, I don't), then it's a dud.  It's any artists prerogative to experiment and change their sound, and try something different.  Another artist I'm a big fan of, \\"Juno Reactor\\" (which if you listen to Daft Punk, you may have heard of) did this with their previous album \\"Gods and Monsters\\".  That album was a departure from \\"JR's\\" norm and wasn't that good.  They wanted to try something different and that's fine, but luckily \\"JR\\" decided this \\"new sound\\" wasn't their future (and from listening to fans too) and went back to the sound that their fans liked and attracted them to \\"JR\\" in the first place with their newest album (which is awesome).  Hopefully \\"DP\\" will do the same with their next album, but knowing their track record for releasing albums, it probably won't be until sometime in the 2020's!ods and Monsters\\".

B009RX85N0|3.0|What to say about the second season of Once Upon a Time? I have to say this season was all over the place. It had some good episodes but a lot of bad ones too and a few in between episodes.<br /><br />Best episodes: Broken, We Are Both, Tallahassee, Queen of Hearts, Manhattan, The Queen is Dead, The Millers Daughter, The Evil Queen and Straight on Til Morning.<br /><br />Worst episodes: The Doctor, The Outsider, In The Name of the Brother, Tiny, Welcome to Storybrooke, Selfless Brave and True, Lacey and Second Star to the Right<br /><br />The good points of the season is we meet new characters Aurora, Mulan, Lancelot, Phillip, Captain Hook and Robin Hood. We see another way of how Regina became evil half of it cause of her mother and the other half being Rumplestiltskin. We also found out what happened to Rumplestiltskin's son Baelfire. Plus we had eye candy when episodes were terrible too! ;)(Captain Hook and in the 19th episode Robin Hood)<br /><br />The bad points of the season is certain characters had way too much screen time and others didn't have enough. Even with the new characters we didn't really get much stories on them. I was mad when we first met Hook that it was mostly about Rumple and Belle. I know there's a lot of people that love them but lets face it there were a lot of women that were more excited about Captain Hook. Theres also a lot of people that hate Rumple and Belle too and I can't blame them. Robin Hood's story was again mixed in with Rumple and Belle and we don't even see him for not even 5 minutes. Also we didn't hear much about Archie, Red and Jefferson.<br /><br />Also this season didn't have the wow factor like it did last season. When we find out what happened to Baelfire and made the connection that he's Emma's ex boyfriend it wasn't a shock. It was like yeah okay we saw it a mile away. People had that theory since the first season. I was expecting a twist but unfortunately we didn't get it.<br /><br />For the third season the writers need to step it up. They need to give everyone equal screen time and come up with better storylines and mysteries. I think this season could have been cancelled if women weren't watching for the hot guys because the ratings on this season did not do well and they could have done a lot worse than it did. Also the writers need to stop mixing everything together. It was already enough that Rumplestiltskin was Belle's beast and now Captain Hook's enemy? Come on! I know the writers have a lot of ideas but not everyone of them is going to be good. The twist with Jack being a girl? That was awful.  Also there were way too many plots going on all at once. There was Emma and Snow White spending 9 episodes trying to get back to Storybrooke, then we have Hook wanting revenge on Rumplrstiltskin, then Rumplestiltskin trying to find his son, his son wanting nothing to do with him. Then we have Regina and her mother up to no good and Regina and Rumplestiltskin trying to change but going back to their old ways. Way too many plots. Which is why Im glad the writers are having one plot for the first half of season 3 and another plot for the second half. Two plots are better than 15.need to step it up.

And not because the book was bad which it was, but because Ms. Harris went running to the newspapers to complain about her \\"hysterical\\" female fans. Really Ms. Harris or perhaps I should  call you Ms. Judas Harris...it is a terrible thing to use an insult often hurled at women by chauvinistic men- to demonize your readers...we are just silly girls I guess. Well I won't be reading your books anymore. Seriously, you should have treated us with a bit more respect, but then we were foolish enough to read  this series.

B00CBRADU2|3.0|This is a difficult movie to review. If you consider it to be just a beer and pizza type of Western Comedy then you will be very entertained. It is almost a parody of \\"High Noon\\" with the world's most violent drug lord descending on a small Texas border town and only Arnold Schwarzenegger can save the day. The problem is that the movie does take itself seriously at times in the style of \\"Criminal Minds\\". The FBI Agents even use one of those cool FBI luxury jets. This was a big mistake because it makes all law enforcement look like Keystone Cops and Arnold Schwarzenegger looks like a nursing home resident who wanted one last day on the job before retiring. The FBI was notified that the drug lord was going to Arnold Schwarzenegger's town so they send a SWAT team. The problem is that the entire SWAT team fits into JUST 2 VEHICLES! This is Arnold Schwarzenegger's backup for the most violent drug lord in the world! Even when the FBI realizes that they did not send enough manpower they all get into the luxury jet and then drive to the town in - you guessed it - JUST 2 VEHICLES! No National Guard, no Border Patrol, no State Police, no Military.<br /><br />If you want a Western Comedy then this is it. But if you are a \\"Criminal Minds\\" type then this movie is a big embarrassment. Arnold Schwarzenegger has a few good lines like - \\"You make all of us immigrants look bad\\". And I loved seeing him driving into town at the end in the newly converted convertible.<br /><br />Be prepared. The dialogue is very low volume and the sound effects are at ear piercing volume.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Is there anything J.J. Abrams can't turn into gold?<br /><br />After the visionary TV masterpiece [[ASIN:B00005JNOG Lost]] and other hits, The Star Trek franchise is his latest to be touched by his Midas' finger, and soon it will be [[ASIN:B000PMLFRA Star Wars]].  After that, a [[ASIN:B001AOKA3W Cloverfield]] sequel, a few video game reboots ([[ASIN:B00005ME8S Half-Life]] and...ohmygod!...[[ASIN:B00140P9G0 Portal]]), and then he's a producer of Star Trek 3 and [[ASIN:B0094K1WZE Mission: Impossible]] and who knows what else?  The man's a genius.<br /><br />STAR TREK INTO DARKNESS is terrific; it maintains the integrity of the characters, is true to the ideals of the franchise, and besides all that it is a GREAT MOVIE. I thought it hit on all cylinders, even some hokey ones...which any true fan knows are all part of the Star Trek persona. In fact, this new \\"alternate universe\\" Star Trek is really doing a great job of keeping up with the traditions of the old series, treating the parallels with both reverence and, at times, playfulness.<br /><br />I applaud the decision to shoot it in IMAX; every shot in this movie is crisp and lush and BIG. STID is visually so immediate it feels like it takes place in your veins; even the sounds are intense. In our showing one nearby gentleman stood up during the credits and bellowed to the audience, \\"Did anyone else think this was too loud?\\" and NO ONE answered him. I certainly didn't...though yes, it was loud, it was so alive and urgent that I felt I was sharing their atmosphere.<br /><br />So much is done to give the movie an amazing sense of presence, as if Abrams truly understands the reverence that even scientists love to \\"Trek.\\" For instance, whenever warp drive is achieved the ship has that familiar e-long-a-tion that, a la Einstein's theory, stretches it just before it punches into warp. But now the vessel makes a final splintering SNAP! as it disappears, and there is a brilliantly iridescent blue trail that the camera immerses us in as it crackles and pops, as if even its speed is a living entity. And Abrams also understands there is nothing like being aboard the captain's command center; it has a luminous blue and white that shimmers in its intensity, making it what it should be: a magical place that pulses with the presence of command. Even the inclusion of the very appropriate but always missing \\"Permission to come aboard the bridge!\\" is a welcome addition, addressing not only proper naval etiquette, but also the privilege it is to enter the command center of a ship - and ESPECIALLY the Enterprise.<br /><br />As for characterization, the new Trek advances the personalities of the crew without being faithful to the characters they inhabit. There is so much that is correct here in this new iteration of the storyline that I continually found myself actors morphing into the original characters. Chris Pine inhabits Captain Kirk perfectly; he has his swagger and seeming invincibility down so pat that his eventual moment of humility seems truly genuine and moving. The opinion of Sheldon (of [[ASIN:B000VZUWZW]]) aside, Zachary Quinto's Spock and Karl Urban's Bones are so spot on that they seem to inhabit the skin of the original actors. To say too much in the way of specifics would be reveal spoilers, but I will tell you that attention is being given to the original series in so many ways. So many moments will cause Trekkers to grin; and, beyond the more obvious ones there are even some moments and actions that only REAL Trekkers would notice. For instance (and don't worry, I'm being cautious of spoilers): the very fact that Chekov is absent from the bridge for a while is significant, as is the name of a new character. (If there's no Trekker around you, look it up.)<br /><br />And Benedict Cumberbatch is also magnificent as the villain John Harrison; truly intense and dark, he seems to inhabit his rogue with a sinister passion - his lip seems to curl with each word, and he loads the glare of his eye with an evil intensity as deep as space. He is more than a match for Kirk and  the Enterprise, and he carries off his role with such a style that there must be SOME way to get him to return in the future...I would look forward to that so much that I'd look for a wormhole to get there.<br /><br />Abrams has taken a giant leap ahead with STID. He has created a universe LIKE the original, but with the ability to take the old stories and move on FROM there, with respect and admiration for the original. Above all, I suspect Roddenberry himself would have liked this new take on his franchise, because it envisions what he had hoped for: a universe built upon respect for individual rights, where - to quite liberally quote the famous mantra - to boldly go where no one has gone before...or if they did, to go there again, and do something unique the next time around, reverentially, carefully, and with great love.f his eye with an evil intensity as deep as space.

B00BD07SGU|5.0|Per capita, Finland spends more money than any other country on musical education. That goes some way towards explaining the wealth of musical talent that has emerged from those shores in recent years, among its brightest stars Nightwish, Insomnium, Omnium Gatherum, Swallow the Sun, Ensiferum, Wintersun and - at the top of the pile - Amorphis. Upon hearing Amorphis, it's tempting to think that their musical gifts must have come from the Viking gods. While this may be part of the story, the rest is that the band has relentlessly rehearsed, composed, recorded and toured for over two decades.<br /><br />In 2006 Amorphis created an album that demonstrated mastery of their craft. That album was Silent Waters, a vast and varied pastiche of brutal heaviness, mythological themes, immaculate composition, perfect execution, and melodies so delicate they seem otherworldly. The next two Amorphis albums - Skyforger and The Beginning of Times - have the trademark Amorphis sound, a unique blend of heaviness and melody, yet lack the consistent brilliance of Silent Waters. With Circle, Amorphis is back on breathtaking form...and then some. Words can't do justice to the magnitude of this album. A swathe of mythic lyrics, jagged riffs, beautiful composition, wall-crumbling bass and drums, soaring vocals and eye-wateringly gorgeous melodies, Circle has to be heard to be believed. This is the sound of metal with the blinkers taken off and all limits blown sky high.<br /><br />Here's the track-by-track breakdown.<br /><br />1. Shades of Gray<br />Far from the lightweight opening of previous album The Beginning of Times, this kicks off proceedings with riffs that bite like a hungry beast, followed by a bridge and chorus reminiscent of Skyforger opener Sampo. That is no bad thing. The guitar solo is sublime: a folky melody played on clean-toned electric guitars. Tomi Joutsen alternates between clean-vocalled soaring and brutal growls. Light and shade in equal doses. A perfect opener.<br /><br />2. Mission<br />A brief piano intro leads into a gargantuan guitar riff. This is Amorphis on their home ground: gorgeous Scandinavian melodies played with extreme heaviness that magnifies the impact. Flawless and straight from the Silent Waters school of music. Tomi's vocals are clean throughout.<br /><br />3. The Wanderer<br />Not a million miles from Silver Bride in its melody, the chugging guitars of the verse lead into another quintessentially Amorphis chorus, Tomi's vocals soaring over piano, guitars, bass and drums. Like Shaman from Silent Waters, the track lacks real bite or heaviness but is no worse off for it, the melody evocative enough to carry the song.<br /><br />4. Narrow Path<br />The flute intro leads to a riff that's pure Thin Lizzy (no bad thing!). The Celtic theme continues throughout the song, as Lizzyesque riffs meld perfectly with Tomi's anthemic vocal. Somewhere, Phil Lynott is listening to this and smiling. Once again, the guitar solo is worthy of mention. It resonates in my soul and makes me smile. Genius.<br /><br />5. Hopeless Days<br />The verse's guitars and drums are tribal in the style of Saigon Kick's Peppermint Tribe. Again, Joutsen's vocals soar high above chugging riffs. Midway through, the track segues into a section that's eerily close to the `bow down before the one you serve' part of NIN's Head Like a Hole, but delivered in undeniably Amorphis style. The track could be accused of being too derivative, merely piecing parts of other bands' songs together into a Frankensteinish whole, but that whole works as a song in its own right, so I can overlook the perhaps-too-obvious tips of the hat to other artists.<br /><br />6. Nightbird's Song<br />Half a minute of delicate intro is followed by a roar from Tomi and a riff that's atypically discordant and almost black metal in its tone. This soon gives way to the more familiar sounds of clean guitars and soaring vocals. After a prog-rock section with Jethro-Tullish flute (really),a second roar from Tomi signals a return to heaviness. A diverse song, this fuses many musical styles into a coherent whole with its own identity.<br /><br />7. Into the Abyss<br />This tune - from its piano intro to the choral-style backing vocals and soundtrackesque guitars - could easily be Nightwish. Only Tomi's vocals, which are absolutely recognisable, give away that this is Amorphis. Twin guitars - one clean-toned, the other down-tuned - drive the song with a chugging rhythm, above which soars another amazing vocal from Tomi.<br /><br />8. Enchanted By the Moon<br />A poignant melody is delivered with extreme heaviness. Jan Rechberger's drum performance is inhuman. Enchanted by the Moon is a modern-day sea shanty played by Vikings with command of both brutal heaviness and heart-wrenching melody.<br /><br />9. A New Day<br />Epic. A slow burner driven by more inhuman drumming by Jan Rechberger and meandering bass from Niclas Etelävuori. Anthemic metal at its best.<br /><br />10. Dead Man's Dream<br />No messing about. The track starts out as pure death metal, its riffs from Hell accompanied by Tomi Joutsen's demonic growls. Masters of light and shade, Amorphis soon transition into a cleanly sung bridge and chorus carried by Santeri Kallio's Faith-No-Moresque keyboard and the spectacular twin-guitar delivery of Tomi Koivusaari and Esa Holopainen. Special credit must go to Jan Rechberger, whose drumming is once again breathtaking.<br /><br />An amazing accomplishment. If you buy one metal album in 2013, make it Circle.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|As usual, Michael Pollan explores the world of food in a way that makes you seriously consider what is on your plate. This book is interesting on many levels, culinary, scientific, cultural, sociological. It will inspire you try new things from baking bread to making kim-chi and braising meats.<br />There has been some criticism of this book that he is sexist in his exploration of the kitchen and who should be cooking in it. After reading you understand that his criticism is more of the food industry and less of the women who decided to leave the kitchen and go to the workplace. He believes that all of us, not just women, should be in the kitchen, concerned with what we eat and how we eat it.

B009LMTDL0|4.0|Sheryl Sandberg strikes a familiar chord with Lean In, but sometimes in order to \\"lean in\\" and make a difference for other women, you have to lean out first. Quit the corporate world, start your own business and advocate for women's needs from the outside. As a frustrated in-house designer for a furniture company, my perspective was tamped down continually no matter how big a risk I was willing to take in pointing out female-friendly options. Men would get nervous and very afraid of generalizing or creating a product that only appealed to a sub-section of women. Women would distance themselves from me, fearing career suicide by being identified as a woman or especially a mom. You'd think I was discussing tampons instead of finish colors. See my blog at hazzdesign.com for a more complete review.

B003VXRD4E|2.0|The good:Maggie Smith and most (not all) of the other English actors<br />The bad:Some glaring miscasts. Dora, Adult David<br />The gripe:I have 2<br />1)Although the casting choices were generally good, the 2 missteps (Dora and adult David) were so BIG that they could not be overcome - especially since the title character has so much screen time & importance to the piece - flat & lackluster, I thought. The fault I found with Dora was physical - far from a fragile beauty. More like a strapping cheerleader (with a fat Pug).<br />2)Pacing was off for me. Unless one makes 'Copperfield' into a typical mini-series length production - 8 episodes might have been about right - there is little choice but to sacrifice secondary characters and subplots. Choosing to cut made this run kind of 'choppy'. It seemed to lurch from one episode to another rarely lingering long enough to give the viewer a sense of the true substance of Dickens' work - and leaving me disappointed.<br /><br />&#34;David Copperfield&#34; is a long book but a rich experience. This movie, although long (4 hrs.) left me unsatisfied. I spent much more time reading the novel than viewing the movie. If I were to do either again, hands down I'd read the book again. I don't know how they did it, but the 2005 theatrical release of the movie &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; (around 21/2 hrs.) made that long complex  book shine like nobody's business. Every time &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; shows up on TV, which is A LOT, I watch - and love it anew.  This work did Dickens no favors. Don't think I would watch it again.

Really, the best part is the dialogue...no, the best part is the comedy,...no, the best part..  This movie is full of everything a Tarantino fan could want.  Christopher Waltz is amazing and rightfully deserves every honor he received for his performance.

B005LAIIJY|1.0|I've enjoyed a few of QT's films. He has an ear for music and dialog and has used those elements well several times. That said, if the unexpected use of the \\"N\\"-word worked successfully in \\"Pulp Fiction\\", it doesn't necessarily follow that endless use of bad language will guarantee a good script. If slavery is bad, then the proper response must be to shoot every white in sight and feel good about it. Apparently you have to go to Europe to find a worthy white person even if he is a dead-or-deader bounty hunter. A slave owner in the antebellum South might not be a bad person. But if you indicate that he likes to see black slaves fight to the death, your dumb audience can see where you're going. If your movie is morally corrupt and has no redeeming value, you should make it run three hours to make up for a lack of depth.

B000PC0S5K|5.0|If you're easily upset, or unhappy, or curious why Oprah would put this book in her book club and do a 10-week webcast (available on her website) for this book, you should read this.<br /><br />I've read a few self-help books because I was (just starting) to get panic attacks from a change in my life. So far I've loved all the ones I've read and this one, New Earth, is the most recent one and it has helped me understand what all the previous self-help books (Little Voice Mastery and Sedona Method) were leading to.<br /><br />Eckhart Tolle, in his own way, helps you understand how you can catch yourself thinking negative thoughts, feeling negative emotions that is impeding you from making decisions or taking actions under a clear mind. He talks about what is it about our minds that makes us a prisoner of our thinking (ego). I highly recommend it.<br /><br />FYI. I read Power of Now first, and this is a more detailed version of PON. Absolutely loved it. I would by this than PON to give to friends.

B005I4JG80|5.0|It's fun and easy to read. I don't have children but I did just become aunt to baby twins. My sister in law recommended this book to me and it was really interesting to see how American and French culture differs in their philosophy of bring up kids.<br /><br />The author provides her perspective on both cultures, I think, objectively. She's also very honest about what aspect of American or French upbringing she adopted (or didn't adopt) on her children (or at least tried to).<br /><br />I haven't read other books on childcaring, but if you would like your children to sleep through the night or eat more than just chicken nuggets or french fries, this book is a good general guideline as to how the French do it. But if you want specific techniques (esp. for newborns), you'll still want to read other books or check out blogs or community boards. My sister in law and I both think it's a good book to refer back to as your child grows from infancy to at least 2nd grade as the author talks about upbringing that spans from infancy to at least first or second grade. But my sister in law also read other books and other materials. This one is more of a complement.<br /><br />I think it's a fun read even if you don't have kids!! If you're just curious about French culture, this would be a good book to curl up to.

No sampling, except maybe a speck in \\"Contact\\"  Instead, orchestras, electric guitars, children choirs, the best drumming I've ever heard, amazing contributing artists....<br /><br />Don't listen to the haters, they seem to want these near 40-year-old maturing artists to remake the same songs from their teen years (20 years ago)<br /><br />\\"Touch\\" and \\"Contact\\" alone make this worth the purchase.  If they play \\"Contact\\" live, people will riot.  Wow.

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|This book is written with the breathtaking pace of the DA Vinci Code although less people will be familiar with the Masonic references in this book. It's a fascinating read and will lead the inquisitive reader to research some of the reference material. One thing is for sure: you'll never look at DC the same again!
B00B97SNJI|4.0|I loved the first two Dawes albums, so I couldn't wait to feast my ears on this new one too. The verdict: another very strong album packed with catchy tunes and soaring harmonies, and a lot of the lyrics shine with impressive depth too. It may not be my favorite album by Dawes, but with another month or two of listenings, maybe it will rise even higher in my rankings.<br /><br />I'm stumped that some fans of the band consider this new album to be disappointing or weak. To me, it's nearly strong as their other albums, and a few of the songs on here --- such as \\"Just Beneath the Surface\\" and --\\"From the Right Angle\\" - rank with some of their very best. The one tune not written by lead singer Taylor Goldsmith, \\"Hey Lover,\\" could be my favorite of all on this CD; a delightful tune with Taylor and two of the other band members trading somewhat silly verses. A totally addictive tune that will put a smile on your face. I think the comparisons to Jackson Browne aren't so far-fetched, but Dawes is clearing forging their own sound, and I haven't grown tired of it whatsoever. This band is writing and performing some extremely strong music. I'll be eager to hear more.

B005WBBYXO|5.0|I read these books several years ago after seeing the movie The Golden Compass in theatres. I loved the movie and felt like I just had to know what happened next, so I bought the books right away and read them all.<br /><br />I loved the story so much! I didn't think I would develop such a strong connection to Lyra and Will, since they were so young and I was 21 when I read the books. How wrong I was... I laughed, screamed, loved, and cried along with them and for them at every turn of the story.<br /><br />The theological undercurrents weren't lost on me, but I welcomed them, since that's a subject of infinite interest for me. To have it discussed in such a creative way and with such a compelling and heartwrenching story was such a welcome treat that I would recommend these books to ANYONE who isn't squeamish about putting Catholicism in the hot seat.

0142410705|5.0|After many of my friends telling me that I have to read John Green's An Abundance Of Katherines, I finally decided that I would. After reading the 200 page plus novel in less than a full day, I can safely say that this book is one of the best I've read in a long time.<br />The book itself is relatively simple. It's about a child genius named Colin Singleton, who has just graduated from high school, and is now going to college after the end of summer. The special thing about Colin, besides being a child prodigy, is he has dated 19 girls named Katherine. The book starts one day after the nineteenth Katharine has dumped Colin. So, the comic relief character, and best friend of Colin, Hassan, takes Colin on a road trip to rid him of his girl troubles. The unfortunate thing is, Colin will not stop thinking about his most recent ex-girlfriend, so along the trip he decides to come up with a fancy equation to attempt to tell the future about all his relationships. Eventually the pair find themselves in the rural town of Gutshot, Tennessee. After an abundance of adventure (and memories of Katherines) over the course of a few weeks, the two eventually continue on with their summer road trip, with a new friend in tow. I'm not going to tell you what they do in Tennessee or who this new friend is; read it for yourself if you want to know that badly.<br />The book itself is absolutely amazing. John Green is a great author, and he puts the story together fantastically. One of my favorite qualities about the book is that it absolutely hilarious. The comedy in the novel is refined to a point that I got disappointed  the next time I  watched a comedic show, because compared to Katherines, it just wasn't funny. Hassan is by far, the funniest character in the book, with the sarcastic statements to Colin, be them in Arabic or english, nearly always at least make me smile. Colin however, is different. He seems to be a bit oblivious to everyone and everything around him at the beginning of the novel, wanting only to be reunited with his most recent Katherine. Colin is really just lonely, and he tries to fill his void with math, his friends, and Archduke Franz Ferdinand. The whole cast of characters is actually very likable, and I found that none of them were annoying, boring, or overly obnoxious.<br />In the end, An abundance of Katherines is one of the best books I've read in a long time, maybe ever. If you don't read this book, you're seriously cheating yourself out of something amazing.

B00C061I3K|1.0|So disappointed in this.  All the songs are Motown imitations except the last song.  I don't understand the 5 star reviews, it's as if the reviewers had never listened to \\"Human After All\\". I'm sorry, but the Human After All album is what Daft Punk should be.  If I had wanted a Motown record, I'd listen to Jackson 5 or something.
193700788X|1.0|Horrible. So sad this is how a series that I absolutely loved ended. I'm not talking about the direction the story took I'm talking about the whole story. Nothing good nothing interesting. I had hopes of who I wanted Sookie to end up with but it wasn't a big deal. I just wanted a good ending to a good series. Maybe she didn't want us to be sad the series was over so she wrote a really bad book. Or maybe shes going to yell GOTCHA and put the real ending out. Something please tell me its a joke!

B0028IDXDS|5.0|We absolutely love the Wubbanub pacifiers.  We were given one as a gift when our daughter was born and now we give them to everyone we know who has a baby.  They are fantastic and so cute.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|Interesting mystery with a sprinkling of science and intrigue. A very nice touch at the end with an unlikely survivor.

B008SAZHLQ|2.0|Where is chapter 47?<br />Is it just cut short on purpose or is not included in kindle edition?<br />Was disappointed.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|This is an amazing story it is a Must Watch it is a very moving story about a great musician, who seemed to just vanish until now.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|I purchased these Sony MDR-7506 headphones a couple of months ago. More recently, I've also purchased Sony's very similar (but not identical - see below) [[ASIN:B00001WRSJ Sony MDR-V6 Monitor Series Headphones]]. My reason for purchasing a second pair (and getting both models) was because the V6's were very inexpensive at the time I ordered ($30 cheaper than the 7506's), and because I was curious to see if I could tell a difference between the two. In reading many of the reviews here on Amazon and elsewhere, I knew that the two are constructed very similarly but there were different opinions regarding both the differences (if any) and which has the superior sound.<br /><br />These are both headphones in the $100 and below price category, which seems like a reasonable price to pay for high quality sound. I do not like to listen to music using earbuds, I prefer this style of \\"over-the-ear\\" headphone. although it does take some getting used to. I also have very inexpensive [[ASIN:B0006B486K Koss KSC75 Portable Stereophone Headphones]] for occasions when I don't want to use my more expensive Sony's.<br /><br />I am very satisfied with the sound quality from these headphones (both models), and with the comfort. They are the first \\"quality\\" headphones that I have owned, and the level of detail in the sound, lack of distortion, and overall quality is simply superb. I am completely satisfied.<br /><br />Now, regarding both similarities and differences between the Sony MDR-7506 and Sony MDR-V6, here is what I have found:<br /><br />- externally, they are almost identical in construction and appearance. The V6 has red stickers on each headphone \\"for Digital\\", and the 7506 has blue stickers \\"Professional\\". The phono jack for the V6 is silver metal (all metal), for the 7506 is gold (rubber and gold). Those are the only visible differences I am able to detect.<br />- when I listen to the two headphones back to back, at the same volume level and with the same music, I can detect a slightly clearer treble and midrange from the 7506, and very slightly clearer sound. This is consistent with several of the other reviewers on Amazon for the 7506, who say they can detect a slightly better sound separation and more open sound for the 7506, with the V6's sounding a bit warmer. One reviewer also says that the internal grounding for the two headphones is different - the 7506 uses a separate internal ground for the left and right channels, where the V6 uses a single ground for both channels. (It seems to me that both grounds are going to the same place anyway, but  if this is true - and I am not able to confirm whether or not it is - then maybe this contributes to a slightly different sound).<br />- some reviewers state that the internal speaker drivers are different for the two headphones. However when I went to Sony's website to check the specifications for the two models, that is not what I found. And here is what the Wikipedia page states for these headphones: \\"both models share the same part number for their driver, but the magnet therein is known to vary. The MDR-7506 was introduced with a samarium-cobalt magnet, as is currently used in the MDR-V6. However, at some point, the MDR-7506 switched to the slightly more powerful neodymium magnet. These changes were made without changing the driver part number.\\"<br />- The box for the 7506 states \\"neodimium magnet\\". The operating instructions included with the V6 state \\"samarium cobalt magnet\\". Possibly either or both of these are out of date (as Wiki states, they may make spec changes over time) - the 7506 box is copyright 1994, and the V6 copyright is 1996.<br />- The 7506 box includes an exploded view and parts list, which is very nice to have. The V6 box does not.<br />- Both headphones include a soft case for storing/carrying the headphones, and both include an adaptor plug so that the headphone can be used with either a stereo mini-plug or a normal size plug.<br /><br />UPDATE 7/22/13 and 7/30/13: The Sony MDR-V6 and MDR-7506 headphones have just recently been reviewed by CNET, with similar comments to my own regarding the small differences in sound quality. Both headphones receive a very high recommendation from CNET. See the MDR-7506 review at [...] and the MDR-V6 review at [...]<br /><br />According to the specifications on Sony's website (which should be up-to-date), the only difference between the two headphones is frequency response:<br /><br />- MDR-7506:<br />  - Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 10-20kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity<br /><br />- MDR-V6:<br />  - Neodymium magnet, 40.0 mm driver, 5-30kHz frequency response, 63 Ohm impedance, 106 dB/W/m sensitivity<br /><br />I am not able to explain how Sony is claiming different frequency response for the two headphones if all of the other specs are identical, but this is what they are saying. And I do believe that the two headphones have slightly different sound.<br /><br />Although there is a slight difference between the 7506 and V6, the sound from both headphones is very neutral. The \\"professional\\" choice between the two seems to be the 7506, and it is the more expensive model. If you read other reviews you will find that the 7506's are commonly used by studio engineers, because they are designed to reproduce the sound just as it is, without adding emphasis to the bass as some other headphones are designed to do. At this point, for me they are both excellent, and for thirty bucks less I'd go with the V6 if I could have only one of the two.<br /><br />I've been using these headphones with the [[ASIN:B006IPH5H2 Audioengine D1 24-bit digital-to-audio converter]], and I am extremely pleased with the quality of the sound.<br /><br />As a final comment, some owners of these headphones comment that the ear pads wear out over time, and some owners also prefer different ear pads for better comfort. I also purchased a pair of [[ASIN:B0016MF7W2 Beyerdynamic EDT 250 Velour Padded Earcushions]] for this reason, and although I have not yet given them a try to compare them with the ear pads that come with the Sony headphones, I do like the fact that it is possible to fit different ear pads if desired in order to provide more comfort, as well as replace them when they have become worn (some owners use these headphones for many years).<br /><br />I notice that there are a very large number of reviewers for these headphones, many of them long-time owners who feel very strongly that these Sony headphones are the best.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I am a solid Alien franchise fan. I've been faithful for over twenty years.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game. love love love how addicting this game was. My family and I went on a vacation to a lake house with nothing to do at night but sit around and do puzzles, so this added a fun competition for us while we were relaxing!

B00915G6YE|5.0|This 7th season brought on some new and intriguing direction to the Dexter story.  It also has led up to an almost compelling reason to watch season 8 which I understand will be the last season.  For us Dexter fans it is a must.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I love it. It is easy to use and I don't have to use extra steps to buy something with one click on.
B002ZG4Q5W|5.0|I had to have this film for my collection of what I consider great Japanese film making.  I have evolved in my appreciation for much of the art especially considering my first encounters with Japanese films such as Godzilla (which I did enjoy for different reasons) and the numerous sequels (most of which I did not bother with).  It's fascinating to see the cultural differences evident in the films from the American film industry approach.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I like to check what everyone has to say about my favorite shows or actors.  Easy to find find most most anything you need to on it.
B00CDFWJIG|1.0|Unless you're a twilight die-hard, you won't love this.  Not worth the money to rent or buy!  They really could have done so much more with this.  It's as if they ran out of money or got tired of directing/acting, and said, oh well, that's it.
B0032CVAQQ|4.0|This one was recommended to me to help in my relationship.  Very eye opening and instructional.  Haven't taken the quiz online yet, but will be.  Good for anyone who wants to understand themselves and their partner
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I have recommended this to several of my friends. The series is outstanding. The HD picture on my kindle fire is so vivid that I actually feel as though I am in the room with the characters. We are all getting caught up on the first few seasons so we are ready for the new one when it starts up again!
1564148793|5.0|Useful information, even if you DON'T practice heavily, just nice to have if things go wrong.. if you do, you will love the information.

0521765757|5.0|A very comprehensive dictionary that not only lists 'regular' words, but also contains entries for many contemporary names from all areas of interest.
B009EP3DJM|5.0|Warrior in my opinion is ke$has best release so far. her talent for songwriting improves with each album and duets with iggy pop and alice cooper shows that she is more than pop, she can also rock! this talented young lady is one of the best performers in music today and is one of my favorites. in closing if u are a fan and havent picked this up yet do yourself a huge favor and do so right away! u wont regret it.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Very slow moving game.  Takes to long to move up.  Long time before anything new happens.  Kids loose interest quickly. Very good graphics.
B005HF0B34|2.0|The plot lines are slow and the so is character development, but it's an interesting portrait of history. I rented the season because everyone raved about the show, but I don't get the uproar. The show is average
B00992CF6W|1.0|You can't tame wolves so it back love wolves and dogs!!!!you might not want to buy,buy on computer for taming wolves,this version is bad!!!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I was recovering from surgery and in pain.  These DVDs kept me interested and did not feel the pain as much.  A great series, I could not turn the DVD off.  I watched season 1, 2 and 3 almost without stopping. I am ready for season 4.
B00A8V3VVG|5.0|Watched the movie and was so excited about it and loved the music laid behind it so much that I had to purchase the soundtrack right away. Opened it as soon as I received it started listening. Its as good as the movie. There are some blues and rap....some classic rock too. Its a great listen!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I was recovering from surgery and in pain.  These DVDs kept me interested and did not feel the pain as much.  A great series, I could not turn the DVD off.  I watched season 1, 2 and 3 almost without stopping. I could not sleep and really appreciated my new friends from Downton Abbey. I am ready for season 4.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|Although I am sure it must be quite difficult to fully capture a novel through a film, this one missed the mark on so many instances.  There were characters that never even appeared in the movie (several who end up having pretty substantial roles in the books as the series go on) and a lot of inaccuracies in general.  However, if you haven't read the book you might enjoy it!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Fun and addictive, I usually just jump on to collect my coins then go about doing whatever I was doing before hand. There are some things that you have to pay for but you can do a lot without using your own money. You can see a lot of  the characters from the movie, which my girls (one is 4 the other is 2) love to see. We just got Bloat . and his ring of fire (;
B002R5QPRI|5.0|This a awesome movie............with the stars in it and Whitney and Kevin's compassion for the movie shows in their performance.............. I LOVE IT.............. I watch it about once a month.........it is action filled and tells a story of Trust,Love and a deep Bond........ buy it !!!!!! LISA M.
B006LSZECO|2.0|If she couldn't use the f word her book would be a third shorter.  Interesting story really weird ending.  No likeable characters in book.  I didn't care what happened to them.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|What a great app! I love its ability to mix multiple sounds. I discovered that two of the music choices were in the same key and created a pleasant, soothing sound.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|if you want to be educated about North Korea read this book.  It makes you appreciate what you have in life
B006XF5BTG|5.0|I like everything about this book. Would recommend to friends. If you follow the plan you would see results. Just keep working.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|I will read every book written by this author.  He makes you realize what you sould appreciate in life. love it!
B008F2AKUA|4.0|Been a fan of huey for years, ever since I was a kid. the greatest hits album is definatly the way to go. He had a ton of songs that got radiio play and you will remember most of them as soon as you hear them.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|good, clean family movie! I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age. My kids loved, and so did dad.
B00CAJP0ZO|3.0|The song &#34;Gettin' Dump&#34; is awesome, it has a real harlem shake type vibe to it but with catchy lyrics though. There are the 2 hits that they pay on the radio but besides those 3 maybe 4 the album really falls flat.
B004N8CP8K|5.0|This works great! Installed, set it up and had it working in seconds.<br />(hmmm, six more words required, I though they wanted a review not a book)
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I honestly read the books long before I recieved my kindle,but I love the series way to much not to write a review. So here I go.<br /><br />The Mortal Instruments is about a girl named Clary Fray who lived an ordinary life but suddenly start seeing gings ohers can't. Such as people. After a while Clary learns about the shadow world from these mysterious pople called shadow hunters that only she can see. But no one still knows how she can see them! Over all, through the book you are trying to figure out why she can see these people and why her mother was taken.<br /><br />SPOILERS!!<br /> So in the story you fall in love with Jace and Clary faling in love with each other. But then you get that super weird twist in the end when Jace and Clary end up, you know, being siblings and falling in love. THAT MUST SUCK!! But I am telling you the 100% truth. DO NOT judge these books by like the first four chapters. And if you start to not like how the book ended and don't want to go on in the series, keep reading it till AT LEAST the third book (but i highly doubt you will be unsatisfied). I know if that seems like a lot of books, but let me just restate, this is my favorite book series and you should really give them a chance. You'll really miss out if you dont keep going. Just saying. So. Um. Just read it. Yeah. Cool. Bye.
0553801473|2.0|Wish I had waited until I could check it out of the library. Pointless meanness to characters I had come to admire.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite records. Cannot believe there are fools with bad musical taste giving this masterpiece of a record one star! wow! Every song on here is great from Break On Through all the way through to The End. This album ranks up there with other masterpieces from \\"the class of '67\\", Piper @ The Gates of Dawn by Pink Floyd ,The Velvet Underground & Nico, The Beatles Sgt Pepper. If you love the Doors and music from this era, buying this is a no-brainer. BTW, rest in peace, Ray Manzarek, who passed away this week. Now he's jamming in RnR heaven with Jimbo.
055357342X|5.0|I believe this is the best of the five books in the series. Lots of action, and character development. Kept my interest.
B00CDXOXB4|3.0|Lots of eye candy, nothing new or creative.  Well one item but it would be a spoiler.  Girl on run, boy likes troubled girl, mean husband wants troubled girl back..yada yada
B004TI1WME|5.0|I like the way this calculator has been put together to carry out fraction calculations. This is simple easy and great! Thank you!
B00C7KYXHW|5.0|A mind bending new ride through an old story.  The characters are well played, athouth will graham is a bit toooo tortured sometimes, and the story line has a lot of interest sidelines to boost up the main plot.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|Wow, what an amazing album!  This CD greatly surpassed my highest expectations.  I first heard this CD when I checked it out at my local library.  I was only 16 years old at the time and found this CD to be strange.  I liked the song \\"Forsaken\\" but all the other songs were to long for my A.D.D. mind to focus on.  I didn't understand progressive music at all back then.  But then when I was 18 I got \\"Black Clouds Silver Linings\\".  I fell in love with that album and listened to it everyday for about 8 months.  Then I decided to listen to \\"Systematic Chaos\\" again.  My second listen to this album made a huge difference.  \\"Ministry of Lost Souls\\" became my second all time favorite song,(Count of Tuscany was and is my all time favorite song).  I loved \\"Ministry of Lost Souls\\" so much that I decided to buy this album from amazon.  I am so happy that I did.  Every song is so wonderfully crafted.  Once you get bit with the progressive metal bug, this CD is going to find itself in your top 5 favorites list.  Buy this album, listen to the entire thing in one sitting, then marvel at what you have just heard....then go buy more Dream Theater CD's!!  It's that simple.
B00CDSVZHY|3.0|The movie was O:K. I rented it in HD but the movie was not clear on my HD tv. Would not buy the DVD.

B007PT3QOQ|4.0|nice game if it didn't glitch and quit working the way it is suppose too do not like how u fix people
B005OZE9SA|5.0|I got this mostly as a cheap way of getting into the audiophile world but ended up using it to record some vocals as well, both the playback and recording are out of this world.  I am using these paired with Sony V6 headphones and I cannot say enough good things about the resulting sound quality.<br /><br />If you are looking for a better way to listen to music on the cheap then this coupled with the Sony V6 headphones cannot be beat for a package under $200!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|Well-written, well played. One of the best on television. The actors are first-rate -- love Jonnie Lee Miller and Lucy Liu.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Such a great read. Read the entire series twice now. Def a page trying. This second book was my favorite of the 3.
B000XUHVY0|3.0|I've recently started listening to these female-led symphonic metal (Is that the term? I don't actually know), and I've purchased a few albums by Delain, Elysion, Evanescence and Within Temptation. While After Forever isn't awful by any means, I felt as though the songs were more about how many layers of sound they could cram into one song rather than actually singing. The growling didn't seem to fit (although I had that feeling about some of the growling in Delain's album as well; so maybe it's growling in general that I don't care for), and there was just so much noise going on without much moderation. After about half the album, I had to switch to something more mellow to give my ears a rest. I think that, in limited doses, After Forever is good enough to warrant buying, but when I listen to songs from the album again, I'll be sure to have it on a shuffled playlist rather than just listen to the whole thing all at once. I'd take any of the above groups over buying another After Forever album, I think.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Does what it promises with no issues in several weeks of use. Interface is intuitive and screens are clean.  Friendly and reliable.
B00CL50LEC|4.0|I liked this movie. Granted, it won't win any awards, but it was a different take on zombie movies.<br />I'll give it 4 stars just because it was entertaining and it made me laugh.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|At first, this seemed like such an odd tale...but as pages turned I found the story very compelling. I didnt want the two stories to be the same person; the main character was so endearing that, as a reader, I could hardly bear the things he endured. And yet, the kindness he received at times in his life was so touching. This was a great book and a well written and thoughtful story.
B00C2C637I|4.0|I always knew who Ray Bradbury was, by the only story I knew was Fahrenheit 451, from the film adaptation with Oskar Werner. This is a great story, clearly an influence on Stephen King. Now I feel compelled to read the Illustrated Man.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Sharp writing and a story that grabs you like an express train! Don't expect to get any sleep after you start as Hugh builds a brilliant plot and interesting characters that result in a written form of crack! A look forward to more of his work.
B0063IH60K|5.0|TRY IT and you will have FUN too! GO ON YOU KNOW YOU WANT TO.Do it right now.Now,,!Now I say
B0028MBKVG|4.0|I'm still reading it because I bought it on my Kindle and I rarely open that thing but any who! It's a great book as I am almost finished with it. It truly helps me stay motivated on those days when I feel like I don't want to run but I do anyway because there are people out there who can't. :)
1432794426|5.0|Thank you so much for this book. You know the truth and write it with so much love. Everybody who want to know what was really going on in this time must read this book. I hope from the bottom of my heart that the whole World will read your Book and the love what Michael wanted to learn us will come more and more. One time the people over the whole earth andere all the animels will live in love and peace. I want to send you love and peace with Mysterium 1 heart. Dina from germany
B000JQU4TW|4.0|Haven't read this one yet either. I have a tendency to put things on my Kindle and they stay forever but like I always say, it uploads very fast, I just need to read them. LOL
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|The quintessential essence of the Star Trek saga is beautifully depicted in First Contact. The witty, suspenseful, and awe of the film will make viewers wanting more of Sir Patrick. He is knighted and this performance shows why.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Dredd for whatever reason didn't do well at the box office and it really is a shame, as I have found it very enjoyable.  It is a dark, gritty movie that remains true to the comic, with excellent visuals, acting, and a solid story.
B0007OCG56|3.0|Alrighty then, let's start with the positives.  The absolutely stunning Paz Vega steals every single scene she's in; Adam Sandler is (remarkably, astonishingly) subdued and restrained; Tea Leoni plays dysfunction like a seasoned veteran; and Cloris Leachman is priceless.  Sandler plays a world-class, successful chef whose bored and dissatisfied wife (Leoni) hires a gorgeous immigrant from Mexico (Vega) to be the new housekeeper--a housekeeper who doesn't speak a lick of English, and who must communicate to her new employers via her bilingual daughter (Shelbie Bruce).  The plot is multi-layered, to say the least; Bruce's character is drawn to the materialistic, yuppie mom, who virtually ignores her own daughter, a sensitive child with some self-esteem issues (Sarah Steele).  Meanwhile the marriage is disintegrating, augmented by a serious attraction between the chef, and his English-challenged employee.  Throw into this volatile mix a booze-soaked, philosophical mother-in-law (Leachman), and writer/director James Brooks has got some serious potential with SPANGLISH.<br /><br />And blows it.<br /><br />The plot comes so close. . .so close. . .to coming together, to gelling, yet ultimately falls short.  Several subplots come close to resolution, only to unravel.  Leoni's character is so unlikable we want the marriage to fail, yet in the end--*SPOILER ALERT!--Sandler and Leoni stay together, with Vega's character--who shares the most poignant moment of the film with Sandler--on the outside looking in, while her daughter is left wanting and unhappy.  SPANGLISH is listed as a comedy, but it's more dramatic than it is humorous, and it's downright sad that it squanders truckloads of potential.<br />--D. Mikels, Esq.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app seems to work an my evo4G. I would recommend this app. Thanks for writing a worthwhile app.  Good on you
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|The game is entertaining but not as ambitious as some of these games..Wish there were more puzzle areas instead of many many searches.
030758836X|1.0|Love the customer review titled \\"Gone Reader\\"<br />I didn't even finish this book --- very rare for me.<br /><br />The world is full of people I don't like and have no interest in \\"following\\" already.<br />These are particularly ugly, self-centered, vicious characters --- why would I pollute my mind with them?<br /><br />This book is my first experience with the author and I read it because it seemed highly recommended and I've been reading mysteries with great pleasure since my early teens. I wish I'd seen a few reviews like this one first.<br /><br />Initially, I was intrigued and engaged by this man's dilemma --- under suspicion for doing away with his wife and, while he claims to have done nothing, we are kept on the edge of making a determination. But then the book devolves into a sadistic and pointless game played out by two people I had absolutely no interest in knowing.<br /><br />Note to Flynn --- you have to make us CARE about your characters. They have to have some redeeming qualities or we end up feeling defiled for having been sucked in, as I did.<br /><br />Even in the most horrific stories (\\"Seven\\" comes to mind) with despicable characters doing repugnant things, we're given SOME people to care about. In this novel, everyone's a turd.<br /><br />I wanted a shower after putting down the book 1/2 way.<br />I skimmed the last chapters to be sure I was being fair. I was more than fair. The remainder was even more revolting.<br /><br />The one redeeming feature of this book?  I BORROWED IT FROM THE LIBRARY SO SHE DIDN'T GET ROYALTIES FROM ME!
B00AS1Q8FW|2.0|I didn't read the book, nor have I ever read anything by the author. But I am a big action movie fan, and this movie was boring and predictable. I have nothing against Tom Cruise, I think he is a good actor, I've just seen a dozen movies with this same plot. Yawn.
B005LAIGN2|2.0|OK, the point of this movie is drama and not realism. But, c'mon. The drama is one dimensional, the acting amateurish.<br /><br />And the realism, or lack thereof. A P-40 running down a ME-109 from behind? Rubbish.<br /><br />Hopping out of a P-40, hopping into a P-51 for the first time, and flying combat immediately? In the real world, this would result in a bunch of smoking holes in the ground at the end of the runway.<br /><br />Sure, some ME-262s were shot down by P-51s. But not in evenly-matched dogfights. If a P-51 got behind a ME-262, the German would just use his 100+ knot speed advantage to leave the area.<br /><br />The colonel and the major did not fly with their men. This is leadership? When I was flying, the boss led the mission, especially if it was a tough one.<br /><br />Some great special effects, which you expect from Lucas.<br /><br />In reality, the Red Tails did have a sterling combat record. But from this movie, it's hard to believe.
0446572985|1.0|I would normally read this book through to the end and then try to forget it. But in this case, I decided to embark on a new path and delete it from my kindle after only 27 pages. Mr. Baldacci has lost a reader and I agree with 90 per cent of the one star reviewers. It is a truly terrible book on any number of levels.
B00CL6HGIK|2.0|Thought it might be worth a chance as plenty of decent actors and Jones but absolutely nothing here. Plot could be summed up in one short sentence. Don't waste your time on this disappointment.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|THISSS is what music is supposed to be. I saw that someone stated that \\"he redefined the album\\" and he did!! I heard it while shopping in RUE 21 and bought it that very same day. What track don't I like???<br /><br />Spaceship Coupe, Blue Ocean Floor, Pusher Lover Girl, I mean you are jamming from beginning to end. The best part about the album was the fact that the track didn't end, as expected, he flips it, extends it and pushes the listener into Nostalgia... Love.Love it and would recommend to ANY lover of music; no genre needed. JT--Timbo, I salute you both for a job well done on showing these youngins what REAL music is!!!<br /><br />~T
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Rented for viewing with spousal unit. It was ok. A little too predictable for me but moved along at a decent pace and acting ok. Did not however, see any kind of acting award for actress. ??? Date movie? If you have to. Spousal unit viewing?  Yes, but does have significant foul language. No real sex scenes. If you can not find something better, then rent but don't expect much.
B0095P31L6|4.0|The kids enjoyed this movie.. a few choice words for the younger, but nothing too extreme. The snake may be imtimidating to small children.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|Read reviews that this did not do well at box office and now so glad I did not waste my money on a theater view. I watched this for a good 30-45 minutes and just too much work to try to put puzzle pieces together and that is assuming movie is a puzzle with pieces that fit. Perhaps I have become lazy but did not find this entertaining. Not recommended.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Some parts of this are almost too much, and I would put it down for a few minutes, but I HAD to know what happened next! Now I want to know how the new plan works. When will the next part be available?

B007V2UGPE|1.0|I played the game for months, and I completed stage 70, then I suddenly lost everything.  I initially enjoyed the game, but it stinks to lose everything.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|This is totally a guy's movie. Funny in a very crude way ... If you enjoy fart humor, then thus is your movie

B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This movie was really enjoyable for the kids as well as myself.  I was happy to buy it for them.
B0045HCJRG|5.0|Naturally it deserves 5 stars -- otherwise I wouldn't be spending the $$ to replace the VHS!!<br /><br />Great, fun movie!
B0087ITBT8|5.0|This is a smart and sweet feel-good film. Great performances, especially from Streisand. Watch it with your parents and/or kids.

B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I happy she is happy, School is out and I wanted to just have a little fun this little game is the brake she needed.  Thanks
B0084U0IEG|4.0|Without revealing too much, just know that the ending of this book gave me a wry laugh of delicious finality with its genius. I was actually surprised when it was done. I love McEwan's work - most of it - and this is on the great list. Though the start is slow, I couldn't put it down once the gears shifted to cruising speed.
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|This is the nicest piano music I have ever listened to. Really sweet, very mellow. This allows a meditative state of being
B009U9S6FI|5.0|I purchased this book because of  my interest  in the Holocaust and  its history. Although this book gave a great personal account of Holocaust events, it's also a great book for  an intro to logotherapy and physiological topics.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I like matching games and really like this one.  I normally play it every day.  I have been playing it for months and never get tired of it - although the tiles are always the same, they are not always in the same location which makes each game different.  The colors are brilliant.  The puzzle can be turned completely around and over to view different sides.  Just writing this review and thinking about Cubistry makes me want to pick it up and play it just one more time.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I regretted waiting to read this book as soon as I finished the first chapter. This book blew all my expectations out of the water. Definitely one of the best book I have ever read.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I purchased this stylus some months ago and use it daily with my Kindle.  I misplaced it for a few days and realized how using it makes my Kindle easier and faster to use.  This one has three heads and comes apart to let you switch to a different size and hardness.  I use it with all of my games, to turn pages, to slide open my Kindle and when reading books. The price is reasonable.  I am so glad that I purchased it.  Nothing bad to say.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I could not put this book down!  I read it over a 14 hour period of time. Only stopping for sleep & bare necessities!, This book is a deeply powerful message of love on the deepest level. Super good read!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I love this series and plan to get the entire set of DVD's.  Arrived quickly but Amazon could come down on the price a little bit!!!
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|No effing way this is a FAotD! This game is amazing! Not that you need anymore reason to, but if you don't, get it now!
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|This game is addicting and good time killer. Good for kids. Just wish you can earn peanuts instead of buying them with real money. That's dumb but then again it's a free app.
B00007GZQZ|1.0|I came home to find what looked to be a crushed package sitting on my front porch. The external package was supper thin and provided absolutely no protection during shipping. I had made the decision that I was going to return this movie and after what I saw next made any uncertainty weather or not I really wanted to return the movie an absolute. Opening the external shipping envelope I found the actual DVD outside of its case. There was no plastic film covering the DVD case which is standard on any new DVD. What I am so complete angry about after seeing this. Was the fact that I paid full price as well as shipping and handling for what I though and what was advertised as a NEW unopened DVD. Instead I received something I could have gotten for one dollar through red box. In the past Amazon has always done a great job protecting and assuring delivery of things I have ordered. However this is the Second shipment in the last six months where the item and its condition upon arrival is absolutely outrageous and furthermore
B007N5YIUS|5.0|My brother is so in to this every day he plays it I love it too it's so good<br /><br />.
B001BKM3MQ|5.0|John demonstrates his maturity in lyric writing. The song writing is refreshing in the contemporary music scene, which I listen to all the time, and the words are deep and meaningful. And his voice does complete justice to the words. I enjoy listening to it and I listen often.<br /><br />Must buy.
0525952926|5.0|This book was truly wonderful. It picked up from where the first installment ended and then quickly moved into WWII. I appreciated how Follett humanized the war from multiple perspectives. I loved how he wove the characters in and out of the story and how they all touched each others' lives directly and indirectly. I personally can't wait for the third installment.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|I love this movie. Everything came packaged as expected! It even came with a cover for the plastic dvd case.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I use this mainly for viewing documents, and it works well enough. I haven't tried seriously editing, for that I still use a PC.
B00BWJARHO|3.0|The story line was like a spider web and was disappointing. Other that that, it was a high quality action-filled movie.
B008PEXCBM|5.0|every aspect is so strong,...but the dancing!  Brilliant...Jerry Robbins at his best. So expressive, telling a story, and not a wasted step
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Does what a file manager should.  Some of the icons aren't as intuitive as I would like, for example the &#34;settings&#34; menu icon looks like a cell phone laying over a sphere... I thought it had something to do with the internet.  Does someone have a trademark on using a &#34;gear&#34; icon for settings? that's what I would have expected.
B00C7O8TSM|5.0|My normal beef about live CD releases is that they leave off songs and don't utilize the full capacity of the CD content and my first thought when I got this one was the same, knowing they played 47 songs when I saw them live last summer in what simply was one of the greatest show I have seen and I have seen 500+.<br /><br />That having been said, this CD simply does contain everything you would want or need except maybe \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" played during a majority of the shows on this tour, but given that is only one song not included that could have been, that is a pretty minor note. This set is 124 minutes of music, edited I am sure a bit for story telling etc. that of course made the live show even that much better.<br /><br />As noted by others, the sound quality is absolutely perfect and the performances were and are on this CD the same virtually perfect. I noted during the show and it is a tiny bit obvious here, that at least 3 of the band musicians, including the show director, were covering key vocals that Brian or the gone Dennis and Carl would have or in Brian's case cannot any longer, but folks let me tell you, Brian Wilson did a wonderful job on his key vocal parts during this show and given how he and Mike Love have now separated again unfortunately probably for good, this tour truly could be the last we ever see and hear of this brilliant line up. Sad to consider yes, but making this CD and my memories even more the better.<br /><br />I will say as others have as well, please whomever can, do the DVD up right, with the full sets and plenty of bonus features. Any true fan would pay top dollar for that one and I refused to buy the one that did come out, but instead netflixed it, but it was a shocking edited disappointment. So this CD set bridges some of that gap, but the first class DVD treatment is still required and due us all. Thanks
0152023984|5.0|This should be part of every fourth grade curriculum, once you have taught the teachers how to read for motif and insights!  Too great!  Even in its new edition.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app ever! You can get it free on 4shared.com. It's free to make an account and they have tons of cool apps! This app allows you to build whatever you can think of. You can play on peaceful, when you can play without any monsters. You can play off peaceful, too, and fight off monsters like creepers and spiders. On creative mode you have infinite blocks and can fly. No animals or monsters can spawn in creative mode. In survival mode, you can play peaceful or not peaceful, but animals will allways spawn. I love this game so much, I'd give it 5 billion stars!!!
B00B4804KS|5.0|The way it was meant to be watched!!! Absolute excitement!! This is definitely a must have for DVD collector's. It's a totally different experience in all the right ways! ;)
B00BUT5I84|3.0|I've had mixed feelings about this album when I first heard it.  After learning more about what Jared Leto was trying to produce, I seem to understand more about he's work.  This album was written by him, and one song by Shannon. Total independence is this group's objective with that being understood they've done a half descent job. No number 1's but and enjoyable album die hard fans will enjoy.  IMO \\"Beautiful Lie\\" Is still there best work.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I just gotten this game and I've been looking for this game forever scene I herd about it so yeah.I LOVE IT some much

B00499QUK2|5.0|One of the best shows I have ever seen, I love it so much! I highly recommended it to any age, any kind of person- awesome show.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Its s fun game that keeps me playing. I prefer the D pad as it seems to give me more control than the tilt method.
B005SV9X22|5.0|Great Bonus Features, And the Concert is really amazing! You cant stop dancing, and you get too know her too! you can see how much her art is important too her and she gives you a lot of inspiration. She sings the songs clearly and honestly it is perfect. I watched it a few times because her singing live was so great. I highly recomend.
B006BGZJJ4|2.0|Cord was OK, I guess, but charger quit working and I could not get the cord to work with my computer either.  Very disappointed.  Charger also got very hot.....
B00475BUVM|2.0|I was disappointed the film presentation. other movies that I bought by amazon have been an excellent presentation starting with the case, wait for this as well but did not. seem cheap copies of movies.
B006OAB3ME|2.0|At least that album of '50's covers and 3 new originals rocked. It also had Dave Gilmour on guitar. I'd much rather listen to that. To be honest, I'd rather listen to McCartney II.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I give this book 5 stars because it tells us stuff we should have learned when we were in school about relationships and showing love.  I will buy it for all my relatives and my adult children so they  can get it right early in life.
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This is a wonderful series.  A clean love story with historical themes intertwined.  Although lacking in action or adventure (not a bad thing), this series is NOT lacking in good solid acting.  (It's easy to get angry, flustered, or happy with the various actors and actresses, as they make they characters very believable.)  While I already own a copy (given as a gift), this set was ordered for my in-laws.  I love this series and have watched it on three different occasions... and will be watching it again.<br /><br />If you're looking for a great story that has believable acting and an interesting plot, this is a great series to own or give as a gift.<br /><br />NOTE: After the second or third show, I have a hard time turning it off; like a good book that is hard to put down.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I don't need to repeat everyone's praise for the album; the sales numbers and the numerous awards say it all.
B00A23MYCC|4.0|Overall I thought Ted was a funny movie. The main character was a bit infuriating at times, but there were some good gags, and definitely some throwbacks to the viewer's childhood. However, it really did seem to me that they had a lot more fun producing and making this movie, than we had watching it. The gags weren't super hilarious, but it was either an amazing acting job by everyone, or they were really just having a great time during production. In any case, definitely worth a watch.
1932735410|5.0|This book was recommended by someone who already took and passed the exam. I like the exercises in each of the chapters and the different methods that are used to help one learn the processes involved in project management.

B004DHAC04|5.0|This film is far better than any of the other version.  A film like this would be impossible to make today for many reasons.

He goes on an adventure  to stop a war between Zeus, Poseidon and the under world god.<br />To stop the war he has to find what the gods blamed each other for stealing and bring the things back.<br />This book is amazing! It is one of the best books I've ever read, I recommend it.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I can't give you an honest account of this book as I've only just started reading it . Because it is writen by Tom Clancy, my favorite author , I know it will be a winner
B008AK8FHM|5.0|It is so uplifting to read about the NDE from a once-skeptical neurosurgeon/scientist.  I have always felt there is a spiritual life after our physical death. This is a must read for believers and skeptic.

B009YN2M7S|5.0|Love all of Nicholas Sparks books, I am not sure if I could pick my favorite, but this book was absolutely breath taking it had me sitting on the edge of my couch wanting to chew my nails off,cry, and wish for a love like that. Nicholas Sparks really knows how to make you fall in love with the characters.

B009G78EE2|1.0|I usually don't get caught up in what artists say in social media but since Mac slammed the OKC Thunder for playing his song \\"Can't Hold Us\\"  because he is from Seattle is ridiculous.

B008JFUO72|5.0|Obviously one of the most anticipated blockbusters of the year. It's always very important for any movie in a franchise to do well after a big movie, such as the event that was \\"The Avengers\\". But IM3 totally exceeded the expectations and proved that we fans had nothing to worry about. It combines all the best things from the previous two Iron Man films, with a story and a cast that was still original enough to make for a great movie. Also, the entire Iron Man franchise is very rooted in the ideas of self-destruction and regret. Therefore, if you pay attention to these themes in all three films, then you notice a progressive full-circle kind of thing. The first Iron Man introduced us to the character of Tony Stark and his genius, but there were slight implications of self-destruction in that if he didn't figure out something to do with all of his money and technology, then he would never be able to make up for all the mistakes he made as a weapons supplier/dealer. In IM2, he absolutely has to figure out how to fix his relationships with others and the problem with his arc reactor, or he will most certainly die and regret how he didn't fix them. And now, in Iron Man 3, his obsession with building all these different suits and using them to save the world has finally come back around to bite him in the butt, and he has to figure how to fix it all by himself. This leads to some very welcome flashbacks from Tony's experiences in \\"The Avengers\\". The film's big twist is surprising and very well thought out/set up. Others have said that this totally eliminates the entire idea of the villain, but the film makes it clear that the villian still exists within the film, just in an unexpected way. Besides, when anyone feels that the physical villain of the film does not satisfy, they can always rely on that self-destructive factor of Tony himself. That is also a villain, even if it's just in the metaphorical sense. Shane Black's direction makes sure there is a definite balance between action, great emotion/feeling, and some comedy. At times in the film, all of these things will exist in one scene, usually one right after the other. Unsurprisingly, RDJ turns in a terrific job once again. The rest of the cast also does a great job, especially Paltrow and Pearce. IM3 also doesn't disappoint in the general sense of the franchise. While Iron Man was and still is a great movie, Iron Man 2 was all over the place and never did really find a central theme, but there were certain parts of it that were very good and somewhat made up for where it fell short. Now, Iron Man 3 has absolutely wowed the socks off all its appreciative fans, and still is, according to the box office numbers. It featured what we loved from the first Iron Man in spades, while still kicking all of that up a notch with a much stronger central theme. Therefore, it is the best in the series for me.
B00CDFWJIG|3.0|I know that people always complain that movies don't live up to their literary predecessors, but this one may be the least like the original that I have ever encountered. My book group of four gifted young women spent over two hours watching this film in total shock. Characters have been completely omitted, such as Ethan's father, without explanation. Others have been morphed, such as Amma who now takes on Marian's role of librarian and keeper as well as \\"mother figure\\" and house keeper. The plot has been changed to the point of slight recognition and even confusion. The issues at school are compressed into such a short span of time that it doesn't make sense why Lincoln's mother is rallying to expel Lena from school. Things are also revealed in the wrong way. Sarafine is even revealed during this exchange with Macon instead of waiting until the end party scene. Relationships are also changed drastically. Ethan and Lena don't kelt or even experience the hot electrical feeling when they touch. Lena even puts a weird \\"forget me\\" spell on Ethan at the end of the film.  So much was changed that it may be easier to state what was actually the same. I am sorry to say that this book has been mutilated beyond recognition. It wasn't a bad movie, but fans of the series won't be impressed. I know my group of girls were seriously disappointed. There really was no need to alter the plot in this manner. I can't see myself, or my students, purchasing the next films in the series or even going to see any of them in the theater. In fact, I would be surprised if they finish producing the series at all.
B00CS65JS2|4.0|Nice warm production is the first thing I noticed. the Giorgio track is really awesome, the old school electronics with drums and bass guitar over the top so much more than I would expect from what can be written in paper. Getting the guitar to interact with the electronics on Instant crush - hard to tell where one end and the other begins.<br />Of course the first single, irresistible, not just the music which is super catchy thanks to Nile Rogers but the chorus, who hadn't felt that way before? Those nights were awesome weren't they?<br />Lose yourself is okay but tends to drag on towards the end and along with Within are not as good compared with the rest of the Album.<br />Touch is weird but ends up coming in so 70's and funky gard to not like, even if it is the cheesiest side of yourself .<br />The album is a departure for daft Punk but man they really go for it and don't even think about holding back. What they tried to do here is hugely ambitious and I would say for the most part they have pulled it off.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Brilliant read keeps you guessing all through couldn't put it down real page turner, if you like thrillers this is the book for you!
B00004WFAB|5.0|It´s the best Jimi Hendrix Experience collection of unreleased material, from ¨Purple Haze¨ to ¨Slow Blues¨. Great box set collection.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It is a very simple idea for a game and just so much fun. I got it for my grandchildren and love to play it myself when they are not.
B0029EDMEG|3.0|Ok story line but moved slowly.  Enjoyed Tom Seleck  .  But after 2 episodes and a dog in each.. Didn't feel episode 3 would be different and haven't watched the next movie.
B008133MDK|5.0|One of my all time favorite shows!  I've been a Sherlock Holmes fan forever, and I was surprised at how well his character has adapted to the 21st century!
B0083Z614S|5.0|It was magical and a dream come true also fun and exciting ,best story after harry potter but a close second chose
B00CW665VI|5.0|I really don't write many reviews but the book certainly deserves one for just being such a good, fun read. The author has a great sense of humor and the style was so refreshing. Definitely a book I will recommend to my friends.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Great. Love all Baldacci books<br />This was a thriller from beginning to end.<br />Yes<br />It is definitely worth the read
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|The third book kinda floated in and out. Most of it was a little boring. It had some good points. But it wasn't as epic as I thought it would be.
B005P5TQPU|5.0|Supernatural has came a very long way since the earlier seasons and I love the changes they have made to the story line. I do wish though that they wouldn't of have killed off character bobby singer and castell. Still my favorite show.
B0031RS69G|5.0|Need anyone say anything about Pratchett. If you like his stories go out and buy it. If you have never read a Pratchett book and would like a bit of fantasy in your life - you don't know what you've been missing!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is my first book by Howey and I totally enjoyed it.  Great work! He's now on my must read list.
B007C52NY2|5.0|I live the storyline and the purchase was smooth. When I had an issue it was fixed promptly. They were great!
B009ZXT4BY|2.0|I understand that they want people to buy this game but 15 mins? I didn't finish my world but I was all most done! I will have to buy the game or start all over..... I really had fun though.....
B00BTJMS1A|2.0|This was a total mistake. It was free and got good reviews, so I thought I'd give it a try. Do not waste your time with lt.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Written very well to keep the reader eager to stand with story.  Love well written historical writings.  Fiction written close to how human nature really thinks.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The only reason it did not get five stars is because of how short it was.I truly hope that they do deliver more of the room, the graphics are beautiful and the gameplay is just hard enough to make me use my brain.
B00C7L4QB4|5.0|This show is brilliant, I am completely hooked. The actors, the script, the visuals, everything is great. Mads Mikkelsen makes a perfect Hannibal Lecter. Highly recommended.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I liked the book immensely. I cannot wait to see the movie and compare. It wasn't the easiest read but definitely worth it!
B005KR6OB2|5.0|Saving People, Hunting Things, The Family Business. Love the Winchester Brothers and I can't wait to get Season 8 Idjits.
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|I give the movie 5 stars based on Charlize Theron's captivating performance. Theron nails it with her deliciously evil portrayal of the wayward queen Ravenna. She dominates the screen with her beauty and audaciousness. The scenes Theron weren't in became a little pedestrian by contrast.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This is a fun game.  Not as bad as some of the builders out there where you have to use real money to actually build something.  I understand the people who make these need to make money but don't say its free to play then start asking for money after building just a few houses.  This one isn't like that so far
0385484518|5.0|I have gotten the audio of this years ago.  I saw this play on the media performing in HK 2014 and wanted to read it again.  I loved Tuesdays with Morrie.
B009T8XBBO|4.0|I'm personally a fan of time management games (diner dash, sally spa, etc...). This is another fun game in that group and would recommend it if you like those.  :)
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The writing is beautiful, the characters interesting and complex, the story gripping. I couldn't put this wonderful book down. Susperb.
B003SNKBXW|2.0|The book could be a big mystery involving secret society. but says as a drunk hero browsing around without knowing what to do...
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|My nearly 10 year old and I watched this together and he was engulfed in the story.  A nice change of pace from the normal good vs. evil he is drawn to.
B0049J3QF4|5.0|A fun multi-generational movie to watch. I watched it with my two grandchildren, ages one and three, and enjoyed every minute of it.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|EXcellent movie, which should be seen by all! This is more than a good deed movie, it's about caring for each other as human beings, especially if you have the financial resources - BUT more importantly, if you have a heart big enough to be color blind!
B000N3AWDE|5.0|It is hard to say if this album or \\"Sans Attendre\\" is my favorite French album from the amazing Céline Dion. D'Elles (For Them) is a album directed for women by women, carrying this theme for the whole album.<br />The stand out tracks for me are:<br />2.) Immensité (Immensity) - This song's lyrics are poetic and epic with the musical accompaniment.<br />3.) A Cause (Because) - Great beat! This easily can be a dance track, very addictive.<br />5.) Les Paradis (The Heavens) - A relaxing song with an uplifting message.<br />7.) Femme comme chacune (Woman as each Woman) - A fun song to sing.<br />8.) Si j'étais quelqu'un (If I Were Someone) - The best track on the album, very powerful and a suitable beat. The song was written by Nathalie Nechtschein who is handicapped. This song evaluates what society considers \\"normal\\".<br />12.) On s'est aimé à cause (We loved each other because).
B0053TMP24|5.0|It was so good I feared my life would end! Good thing that I can pick up Mark of Athena now!
B008NBEXZQ|5.0|This is a great album which finds it's way into my cd player every other day. This album 'Sans Attendre' (Without Waiting) is unique from her prior work, tackling subjects of struggle everyone encounters.<br />The album's standout tracks are:<br />1.) Parler à mon père (Talk With My Father), the 1st single has a great beat and a touching lyrics.<br />3.) Qui peut vivre sans amour? (Who Can Live Without Love), the 3rd single. A dark and powerful song describing the often times painful hold love can have on a person.<br />11.) Si je n'ai rien de toi (If I Have Nothing from You), another darker song on the album with a great beat and stunning vocals.<br />16.) Les jours comme ça (The Days Like That), a subtle track with a consistent beat. The song stands out for it's unique quality and how it describes how a relationship can fade slowly, each day with each action slowy bringing it to an end.<br /><br />I HIGHLY recommend this album to not just Céline fans but fans of great music or those who enjoy French music.
B00BT0ZS52|5.0|Sweet and sad and happy and suttle and brute and explicit... All in one, across time!<br />Poetry in motion pictures!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought this micro USB cable together with my Kindle. Length of cable is the right size to be not to short and not to long. Works also perfectly with other devices.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Huge Fan of JT. This album takes a slightly different approach than his past albums. However he still keeps some of this roots.  My top three are: Let The Groove in, Strawberry Bubblegum, and Don't Hold the Wall! Check it out for yourself!
B00C061I3K|5.0|If you only like standard EDM I can understand how this album might disappoint you.  I checked the negative reviews here and the impression I get is that some people wanted DP to churn out the same music heavy on the beat, no real lyrics, and the same tried and true electronic tricks.  I admit it took a couple of rounds to get used to Daft Punk having actual songs....you know, with real lyrics.  The songs may be retro, some may be very introspective or philosophical, but they have actual meaning and many are still very upbeat and catchy.  Even the slower ones are a very nice change coming from the same group that repeated \\"around the world\\" 144 in one song.  Still love that one, by the way.  \\"Discovery\\" was similar in that it wasn't just intense dance music, it had some great lyrics and songs that were more fun and less intense.  This time they've decided to go a little retro and with great success.
044024613X|5.0|Excellent, well written and held interest throughout.  Spellbinding and heart breaking - could not put down.  Would recommend to other readers.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I purchased this for my child for Easter.  She hasn't asked me to buy her a movie in ages!  I have watched it many times since and enjoy it.  I get a kick out of them using music from &#34;my era&#34; and mixing it with their music styles.  My daughter thinks it's all new stuff and I know differently...Good times!  Good film!  Worth a viewing.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|This game works well, has very good graphics, and a nice storyline. It is very easy to avoid spending money on in game items, which is a major plus for me. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy rpg. I did spend money on my character for storage but then I had to reset my kindle back to factory settings and there was no way to save my game or backup my character so I lost what I had purchased.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have been loving zombie flicks since the original Dawn of the Dead.  I had never heard of The Walking Dead until this show.  I am enjoying it immensely!  Will keep ordering it as I got rid of cable.  Ordering through Amazon is easy and still cost effective.
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|This is a great movie with a lot of action and drama that will keep you on the edge of your seat!  I love the lines they say, I'm sure that they will be remembered.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Men In Black III is a great film!  I enjoyed this one very much.  Fun to watch for the whole family!
B004KBSQBA|5.0|I bought this after picking up a badly recorded copy in a rummage sale.  It's great to have in my car--listen to some songs over and over.  I love Paul Simon's crazy-sane lyrics, and the African band behind him is a plus--lifts up even the bleakest of material.
B004UJTG6Q|5.0|My son read this with me.  We both loved this classic. Mark Twain had a way of developing characters that made them come alive.  This was a great way to introduce my son to kindle e-reading.
B004V4DD00|5.0|I liked that this movie didn't  go &#34;hollywood&#34; on the glimpse into the emotional roller coaster ride of corporate life. I teach undergraduates in a business school, and I will use clips of this movie to illustrate key points.
B00A0L7PE8|3.0|Prince is back!  That is exciting.  I do, however, feel that is album is a bit misleading.  Due to the way that the songs are titled, it is not clear to the purchaser that he/she is getting 6 versions of the same song.  While all of the versions are interesting, this is not an album that one could listen all the way through nor listen to repeatedly as a result.
B007N85POS|5.0|this is a very fun game will keep you occupied for quite some time trying to get thru the levels
B000FCKC4C|5.0|Books do not have to be Shakespearean to be good.  Sometimes a simple story is all that we need to remind us of what is right in front of our face. Coelho consistently delivers and this book does not disappoint.
0679805273|5.0|My parents purchased this book for me as a gift for my college graduation. It's great for all ages, not just kids. I love the artwork! It is well written, sweet, touching and inspirational. Recommended!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|great quality.<br />Works as advertised.<br />good packaging.<br /><br />You can use this on knives. It doesn't work very well on pencils.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It always works with no problems. Easy to use and great on the kindle fire. I would definitely download this if your looking for a calculator and don't have one already.
B000FC10WU|5.0|Agatha Christie is the best mystery writer in the world. Why would I say this? Because there is no one who can write so descriptive and still have that punch - the  surprise ending. An ending that even the most careful reader would not suspect. Her knowledge of poisons is vast and she puts this knowledge to work in her books. I love reading her books. They are never bogged down with boring details that have little to do with the story line.  They keep you glued to the story. A toast to the best!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo blitz is the best bingo game I have ever played.  I have more than nine bingo games downloaded and this one is the best.  I have made new friends and spend hours of fun chatting and playing and sending my new friends gifts. I recommend this game to everyone.
B000IDEQTK|5.0|This is a true love story in more ways than one.  I was not disappointed.  I wanted to watch a good simple movie to take my mind off the destruction of our country.  I wish it has a sequel.  I don't know how I missed this movie when it first came out.  I don't think you will be sorry for watching if you are a female!
B000V5Y1SQ|5.0|It was really enjoyable and easy to watch. I look forward to watching the rest of the seasons. A great show
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Love with so many barriers.  This was a heart felt story with deep messages.  I recommend this for all my female friends.
0743497465|5.0|Dan Brown has evolved into a successful best-seller writer. But, for me his best writing is the early books. I was bored with DaVinci, loved Inferno but only because it is set in my favorite places and has emotional response for that. Fair enough?  I read Deception Point (and Digital Fortress) when they were new and loved them. I didn't care that the science and technology might have been a little off -- this is fiction, so go with it. These are THRILLERS and they thrill. So, should you also not really care much about the best-sellingness but have not had the opportunity to become familiar with Brown, try these. Especially Deception Point!
B0081BU42O|5.0|As a recent, instantaneous super-fan of all &#34;Culture&#34; books (I have blasted through 8 books in under 2 months), this one gets 5 stars for giving me 2 things I longed for: 1) another smashing, home-run story that FINALLY (through the plot itself) explained to me in detail what &#34;Subliming&#34; is; & 2) provided for me in GREAT detail what an ongoing debate among & between no less than 7 unimaginably intelligent &#34;Culture Minds&#34; (concerning a very serious issue) would actually sound like/be like, as Banks &#34;immerses&#34; the reader in this ongoing debate (that, simultaneously shapes the story as it unfolds in real-time); ultimately showing us HOW the Culture makes these decisions that impact huge #'s of civilizations so far into the future. This one has it all: multiple eventually converging plot lines, HILARIOUS dialogue, strong pace/strong characters, and new, even more mind-blowing high-tech stuff that can ONLY originate from the mind of Iain M Banks.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|Though a die-hard Star Trek geek, I refused to see this film because I did not trust the whole reboot and didnt approve of new casting.  Then a few friends told me that they had seen the new movie and that I had to see this one before I saw &#34;Into Darkness&#34; for the continuity and storyline, so I sat down with a friend the other day and watched it for the first time.<br /><br />I was *thrilled* with this movie.  It wasn't perfect and there were some questionable and even laughable moments in the storyline, as well as a plot hole or three, some things that changed from the canon that I did NOT like, but overall, I liked the film so much I bought it on Amazon Instant Video as soon as I finished watching it.<br /><br />For anyone who is still hesitant, know this from a lifelong Trekkie (I am not a &#34;Trekker&#34; unless I'm hiking!) - you will really love this movie.  Watch it.  You won't be disappointed.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|With the usual blend of wry humor and &#34;can't put it down&#34; intensity, he's done it again.  Can't wait for the next (John Corey) novel...
B00C061I3K|1.0|Please tell me what you people see in this album. I'm a fan of of past albums but accepting this is asking too much. I think the experiment with replacing electronic instruments with humans failed. This album has no replay value. Beyond is the only song I like---never mind, I take that back.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|A smart and determined human facing epic challenges in order to survive.  This is quite a story that kept me on the edge of my seat.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|One of the best musicals ever made. Great dancing, singing and funny too! I saw the movie again after a number of years and I still found it just as enjoyablel and fresh as the first time I saw it. Gene Kelly and Donald O'connor were terrific and of coure Debbie Reynolds was fabulous. If you have never seen this classic, I suggest you grab some popcorn, sit and enjoy!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|To help him through his journey with mental instability, those who love him are protective and secretive. A woman with her own illness brings him back to reality over time. A page turner filled with emotion..<br />fear, hope, pain, and eventual acceptance.
B0063M22QO|5.0|My wife plays this frequently and seems to enjoy it.  If you like a game that require thought I recommend this one.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson redo the film done by Judy Garland and James Mason a very good performance by both
B00BYISQTO|5.0|It's a slow burner. It took me five listens before it grabbed hold. But it is worth the labor. Exquisite.
B007SUW24W|5.0|LOVE every song like seriously he knows what everyone is going through or been through BEST ALBUM OF 2012 AND IVE EVER BOUGHT..
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I enjoy the game, it's a different type of game. Fast paced, that's where my problem comes in. To move and match the tiles is a little difficult most times than not. If controls were smoother, this would be a five star game.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|Im old school and this is right up my alley.This album covers all bases.L would recommend this to anyone who loves that funky,rockin,hip hop,jive flavor.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|So as you know, I don't usually enjoy apps and the reviews I give them usually don't help the app but this is a fun, interactive, exciting game that allows you to reach new levels of length, gather coins, buy new tracks and cars, and upgrade your vehicle. I DEFIANTLY suggest this app for anyone with free time that wants a fun game to play.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This book was very well written and a gripping story.  I really enjoyed the confessional nature of the book and the insight into the thoughts and feelings of a mother who feels responsible for her child's actions.  I highly recommend it!!!
B00BTJMS1A|1.0|I suggest to anyone looking to buy this app that it is a waste of storage and time. The graphics aren't good and it isn't very helpful on telling you what to do. Don't buy this app.
B008532S54|5.0|Raunchy beyond belief...but also hysterical for the right type of fan. The cast was fantastic!<br />Great for Rudd & Anniston fans.
B008B68J2G|5.0|My daughter has had so much fun with this and her friends love to play with it as well - very popular toy.
0739322125|2.0|I did not even finish the book.  I only got 2/3 through it.  Coben depicts violent torture too, too much.  I do not want to know the details of that kind of violence.
B00B0U2SFE|5.0|This gem of a historical drama was wonderfully presented in an award winning fashion; it is a rare treasure I was delighted to add to my &#34;true story&#34; DVD collection.<br /><br />Faithfully and flawlessly recounted, this inspiring story taken from a tragic period in our 'not-to-distant' history is crammed brim-full of brilliant actors giving Academy Award performances under the brilliant direction of a master filmmaker.
B0088O11NU|1.0|The second it downloaded I got a notice that the app contained two security threats. Uninstalled immediately!! Surprised nobody else commented on that.
B00BEZTMFY|4.0|Yet another rendition of a classic.<br /><br />I enjoyed it in spite of the fact that it's been told, and retold....and retold so many times.  The videography was beautiful and the actors did a great job and that's what made it worth watching - AGAIN!
B009IF82SK|5.0|I really love it and do not afford to miss a single episode.<br />The jokes are inteligent and the situations are very close to peoples' life.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|Liam Neeson was totally wasted in this VERY boring story(?).......WHAT A TOTAL WASTE OF TALENT, TIME and MONEY!<br /><br />Skip this one....you'll be glad you did!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|this is a well made game with a class for every one not to mention female calsses for the girls vary play able
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|This copy of Helen Hunts latest movie was purchased as a gift....I loved my copy of this movie so much that I wanted to share it but I couldn't bear to part with my copy!<br /><br />An excellently presented TRUE story....watch it for yourself ~ you'll love it, too!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I couldn't be happier. The frequency options really helps with my anxiety and chronic pain. I can even use it for my kids. Puts them to sleep every time. I am really grateful to the creators. I don't even need sleeping pills.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great game I got free and can keep playing free. Fun and easy with new goals to keep u interested.
B008F9E306|4.0|Tip is back to his old self...the thing that made him the artist he is known for today. It was better than expected.
B00AEFXUL2|5.0|We are loving it we watch several time a week, and never get tired of watching it, we will never get tired of watching John Wayne Movies.
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|JT brought his \\"A\\" game with this one. For this guy to record this album in about a month and a half is genius. I already liked him as an artist but my level of respect just went up for him. The BEST R&B ALBUM in 2013...without a question!!!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Enjoyed  the movie. Very detailed and fit story that I had watched on a tv show. Enjoyed the music as well.
B0055V6EZE|3.0|for my mother.  she loves hugh laurie, and loved the show House.  i figured she might like the album because of her huge old man crush, but i am pretty sure she has still yet to listen to it.
B001DUDKEY|4.0|I thought this was a faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's Persuasion.  The acting was excellent and the character's true to the story.  I would have probably given 4.5 stars, but couldn't give 5 stars because there was just a little too many camera shots of Amanda Root's big doe eyes and tight-lipped expression.
034580404X|4.0|i thoroughly enjoyed the first book.  it didn't give me any new ideas or anything, but it was a good read.  as the series went on, more and more drama and catastrophes happened, and it started to be less believable.  well, not that it was in the first place, but i digress.  by the third book, i was bored.  i had to force myself to read it every night just to get it overwith.  i spent the money on the trilogy, and i was going to finish the trilogy.<br /><br />i couldn't even tell you how it ends.  i think it's some happy-ending-sunshine-and-rainbows BS, so now every awkward woman thinks she can literally trip her way into some millionaire's life & end up happily ever after.  i mean, if you don't count the airplane crashes, stalkers, death threats and anal beads.
B001OSIV62|4.0|I enjoyed the documentary, but I did not like the fact that they kept showing the same shots over and over for different parts of reenactments.
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Very good story line. Good book to read at the beach. Much different than what I expected. Overall very interesting.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|you will love this movie for sure.  It's one of my fav, all the BBC Jane Austins are the best.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game is cool, very glad I downloaded it. Pay it every night before I go to bed. I think anyone that like hidden object games, should download now.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I read so many great reviews of Tangled pre-release, and I was super, ridiculously excited for its release. When it finally went live I was a little scared that it might not live up to the hype, but I'm ecstatic to say that I was dead wrong. I'm still in a book hangover after reading this amazing book two days ago. It has everything a girl needs in a romance book: witty humor, a hot lead, a strong heroine, lots of sexual tension, a happily ever after, and of course, steamy sex. I loved that the book was told from Drew's point of view, and Emma Chase pulled it off flawlessly and hysterically. Drew is swoon-worthy, blunt, clever, arrogant, rich, dirty-mouthed and a certified man-whore; but he also has a sensitive side he refuses to acknowledge. Kate doesn't take any of his crap, and although I just wanted to shake her at times, she is the perfect girl to balance Drew. I have a weakness for funny books and this book had me dying with laughter. The supporting characters make it even funnier, from Drew's best friend, Matthew, to Drew's four-year-old niece, Mackenzie. This book is guaranteed to make you laugh, make you cry happy tears, and definitely make you sigh of bliss wishing men like Drew exist. I hope to see more books from Emma Chase!
1615238948|5.0|reailty of life in that time period .extremely interresting and quite upsetting @ times . makes you stop and think how lucky we are to live free!
B008BU75IQ|4.0|I have to say the first two books of what I thought was to be a trilogy where much better. Somehow this one left me a little dissapointed. It didnt seem to have the same depth as the others
B0071AKB38|1.0|It does not work. The bluentooth does work as i can skip tracks but it produces no sound and it is impossible to find a services center to return to.<br /><br />Not happy with this purchase. Makes me not want to buy on internet anymore!
193700788X|1.0|Please read these reviews and don't waste your money on this book!  You will be able to find out about the entire book and what we are all so upset about just by reading the reviews.  I am so disappointed that CH actually thought this book was a good series finale, but even more upset that her publisher actually thought it was okay to publish and charge us $12.99 for such a piece of crap.  Shame on you CH, and if you think I will even consider wasting my money on your new CODA series YOU ARE SADLY MISTAKEN.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Loved it. My fifteen year old son also enjoyed it. Would like to see more puzzle games like this one.
076780421X|5.0|I received this DVD very quickly.  I was surprised.  Thanks again.  Love this movie!  I have already shared it with several people.
B002XXNSF6|5.0|It grabs you and makes watching Before Sunset compelling.  We all have visions of doing some wild and crazy adventure.
B006MW3UZW|3.0|In my opinion the show is taking a turn for the worst this season. The show is looking more and more and more like a soap opera melodrama, the characters are stagnating, and the plot is moving at a snails pace. I have watched about 1/2 to 3/4 of the season and given up.
B00BHMF578|5.0|I know the ending-but there is no way I could calmly watch the end airport scene without getting jumpy. Excellent acting by Ben Affleck as always.<br /><br />Well worth the rental.
B00499NHLC|5.0|British TV is making a surgence with shows like Copper, Sherlock, and Downtown Abbey making it big. In this show Sherlock is re-envisioned in the modern world. The acting is terrific and the mysteries are exciting. Highly recommend.
B009MYARIK|5.0|Sophie is one of my favorite authors and her series of shopaholic books were iconic. I remember being in London Heathrow waiting for a flight home and I thought I'd check and see if there were any new books. I had the surprise -she had a new book. All I can say, Is the entire flight home (8 hours), I laughed -literally out loud and when people went to sleep I had to keep it in (that was hard).<br /><br />She writes funny, but truthful stories about our lives, some more exciting or depressing than others, but always worth the read.
B00BF123WG|3.0|I didn't like this movie much but it should be noted that I had high expectations so the let down could have been more dramatic. I found the story to be hard to follow early on when they would say names and situations without giving back story. the expectation is that we should all be VERY familiar with these events. I believe that mass majority will not be familiar at the level the movie expects us to be. It was pretty dull overall. I get that the CIA is probably not as exciting as the Bourne Identity movies make them out to be but this was exceptionally dull and desperately needed some flare.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Fantastic game, thank God for the hints they provided thru out the game.  look forward to the next one that you come out with.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is one of the best books I've read.  The way it's written I cannot explain, you have to read it yourself :)  The characters are beyond awesome.  The story is not a thriller, it doesn't have a super intensive climax, it's just like a perfect wave you ride out til the end... AWESOME
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Great sci fi  movie starring Jodie Foster. I enjoyed the movies theme in reference to  our connection to the universe. Also liked Jodie's relationship with her dad. The special effects also looks great on the blu ray edition.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I’ll admit it. Even though I am addicted to reading, sometimes I get a little jaded…And then a book like Tangled comes along, and BAM! Just like that, I’m addicted to reading again. Seriously, a book that cites Braveheart, the Borg, an NYU sex study and frogs? I’m in.<br /><br />Tangled is one of the most original books I have ever read. Told from the main male character Drew’s POV, the very talented author gives the reader a peek into how guys really feel and think:<br /><br />“Every healthy man in the world wakes up with a stiffy. A fatty. Morning wood. I’m sure there’s some medical explanation for the phenomenon, but I just like to think of it as a little present from God.”<br /><br />Drew is insanely attractive, smart, hard-working and very wealthy. Sounds cliche, right? In the hands of this talented author, Drew is one of the most memorable and original characters I have ever encountered! I love Drew’s inner monologues. They are both hysterically funny and very, very touching. He’s a self-confessed womanizer who meets his match in the very smart and gorgeous Kate Brooks. He falls hard for Kate and all his old rules about women and dating fly out the window.<br /><br />“Women fall in love quicker than men. Easier and more often. But when guys fall? We go down harder. And when things go bad? When it’s not us who ends it? We don’t get to walk away.<br />We crawl. “<br /><br />The author has described the genre of Tangled as “Comedic Erotica” and “Funny Smut.” Both phrases describe this book to a tee. It is both hilarious and very, very intense. I started reading this book past midnight and did not want to put it down. Seriously, it’s that addictive. Don’t waste time reading this review. Start reading Tangled. You will absolutely fall in love with Drew!<br /><br />ARC provided by the publisher in exchange for an honest review.

B004J4WKTW|1.0|I'm sorry.  I read this book for my book club.  I could not finish it.  I wanted a story and all they did was turn on lights.<br />It was well writen, but there was not a story or plot
B0094M2SCI|4.0|Nothing really ground breaking here, but a solid action movie, don't think too much about the plot although they did try to give it some depth it comes across as somewhat predictable. I gave it 4 when it should probably get 3, but it was better then I expected. I'v actually watched it several times which I suppose is a recommendation since I don't normally do that.

B00CS65JS2|2.0|If you have been a fan of Daft Punk as long as I have (not all you people who discovered them with \\"Discovery\\"), and I'm talking about before \\"Homework\\" came out with Bangalter's stuff on the Roule label as well as the entire catalog of the Crydamoure label, then you would understand why Random Access Memories is a complete and utter disappointment. I don't know what A&R guy at Columbia thought that this was going to be the \\"next\\" step in the EDM movement, or maybe they were just hoping to cash in on the Daft Punk franchise since their name alone moves units (which is undoubtedly why 95% purchased this album in the first place) . But honestly, its almost unlistenable, way worse than \\"Human After All\\", which at least had some success with Busta Rhymes sampling Technologic for his song \\"Touch It\\", as well as the \\"Robot Rock\\" being used as the background music during the fight scene at Tony Stark's mansion in Iron Man 2. Even though critics slammed \\"Human After All\\" because of it being such a departure from the Virgin Records radio friendly \\"Discovery\\", it was still undeniably Daft Punk'ish...which is a lot more than can be said for their newest album that took them 8 years to put out.<br /><br />Let's take a step back for a second. in 2007, \\"Alive 2007\\" comes out, which was the live set of Daft Punk from Coachella. Not really an album per say, but everybody was blown away. Way better than its predecessor \\"Alive 1997\\". Maybe it was their light shows, or the nostalgia of hearing Romanthony's voice hit over the chords of One More Time, but everybody loved it. If you don't have that album, I strongly suggest buying it way over Random Access Memories, because that could be considered a Greatest Hits/Live Album all rolled into one. It had literally everything you could ask for, even the side projects of Bangalter like Stardust. That release had such promise, and had given a pulse back to Daft Punk. Earlier the same year Kanye West drops \\"Stronger\\" sampling Daft Punk \\"HarderFaster Stronger\\", and I think it was safe to say that everybody and their mothers thought that in 2008, Daft Punk was going to release an album that was going back to their roots and disco sampling and straight up house and funk, a sound that they established with \\"Homework\\" and \\"Discovery\\". But then nothing, until they did the soundtrack for Disney's Tron Legacy...which sort of sparked a hit with \\"Derezzed\\", which was still undeniably Daft Punk (think \\"Alive\\", you'll get it). Then all of a sudden electronic artists like the Chemical Brothers and Crystal Method are sought out for musical scoring, but that's another story.<br /><br />Maybe it was a disconnect with the fans, or maybe they are trying to set themselves apart from the laptop jockeys and try to define themselves away from the cookie cutter pop EDM scene, but honestly Random Access Memories couldn't be more of a let down. I know producers now are trying to recapture the Quincy Jones/Michael Jackson era with releases like \\"Fine China\\" and \\"Blurred Lines\\" respectively with other artists, so maybe the label thought that Daft Punk ditching the disco sampling and resorting to \\"live\\" instruments was a better approach. Unfortunately, it falls short, and I mean way short, of the high hopes we all had for the album. Do you honestly think we're going to be listening to \\"Get Lucky\\" the way that we've listened to a lot of the Daft Punk songs in the future? Truth be told, if Daft Punk re-released \\"Discovery\\" right now, with new remixes from Skrillex and Avicii or whoever else is big on the scene now, it would still go platinum and be WAY better than this. If you like the album, then I'm sorry. I see some people are reviewing it as disco. If you want a good disco album, go buy KC and The Sunshine Band's greatest hits. If you want some good Nu-Disco, then seek out the Kitsune label. To say this album is Daft Punk moving \\"forward\\" is the same as saying Moby's \\"Animal Rights\\" album was him moving \\"forward\\" as well. Don'tget me wrong though, these songs will be licensed enough to be shoved down our throats in commercials and music on TV shows/movies,, but that alone doesn't make an album successful or good. If you are a REAL fan of the group, and the French house movement they were the forefathers of, then I hope you are as disappointed as I am. .
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|This is a really well done series.  It took me a while to get into it, but after a few episodes I was hooked.  There were a fair amount of plot twists I didn't see coming.  The only think I could say that's even remotely negative about \\"Vikings\\" is that the primary protagonist Ragnar Lothbrok, is kind of a butt head some times.  :)  Still though, he makes for a good character (just not always a likable one).  I'm looking forward to more \\"Vikings\\" in the future.
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I came about the Lee Child's character because of the recent movie.  I could not put this book down! I loved the story line and I love Reacher's attitude! I have the 2nd book in the Jack Reacher series and I can't wait to read it!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|It should be interesting for people who like Twilight.<br />It's clear, that make movie after book is really hard. Just not enough screen time.<br />Actors are good, but the whole 'game' thing... well, Romans perfected bloody sport to death. This futuristic one is not that 'entertaining'....

B0053YGYO4|4.0|Coldplay's fifth studio album brings something new to their pop-rock sound: a sustained narrative. In theory, at least, \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" is the story of two young lovers, Mylo and Xyloto, who live in an Orwellian future where things like love, joy, and bright colors have been banned. The two are part of an underground resistance that's trying to bring some vibrance back into the world.<br /><br />The listener could be forgiven for not knowing any of this, since within the songs themselves the story is approached obliquely, to say the least. That there is some connection between the tracks is apparent, but just what it is will likely remain obscure without the help of outside sources. (I saw other reviews which explained the concept, as well as one of the music videos, which features an animated short of the characters.)<br /><br />This album is still a pleasant listen even if you never learn anything about the purported back story. The lyrics retain Coldplay's characteristic touch of the poignantly personal, though the music itself is a more mixed bag. The instrumentation is still thoughtful, and the songs have a \\"lighter\\" feel to them than many of Coldplay's earlier tracks (they sort of sound like the amped-up offspring of \\"Strawberry Swing\\"). A few of them, like the single \\"Paradise,\\" are pretty catchy, but others come and go without making much of an impression.<br /><br />As a whole, \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" feels, well, a bit muddled. The story is hinted at, but never really arrives enough to bring cohesion to the album. The music adds an interesting twist to Coldplay's sound, but I came away feeling Mylo offered less variety than previous outings.<br /><br />And yet I'm optimistic. Coldplay's albums seem to fall into a one-two pattern in which they create a new sound on one album, then refine it to perfection with the next. [[ASIN:B0000508U6 Parachutes]] was excellent, but [[ASIN:B000069AUI A Rush of Blood to the Head]], in the same vein, was better. [[ASIN:B0006L16N8 X&Y]] was alright, but [[ASIN:B000RPTQ1C Viva la Vida]]  developed its ideas and was a masterpiece. So if \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" isn't perfect, I'm not worried. In fact, I'm excited to see what comes next.<br /><br />~was alright, but [[ASIN:B000RPTQ1C Viva la Vida]]  developed its ideas and was a masterpiece.

B00BB8SKPW|5.0|this was a fantastic movie. the story line i so relevant and Denzel was superb<br />I was really impressed with the plot well written and directed
B000006UD8|5.0|The Deep Purple is a heavy-rock-jam band. It means that any new version of any Deep Purple song is a new discovery, new masterpiece. I don't understand those people who say that Deep Purple &#34;suck&#34;, you can say you don't like Deep Purple if that's the case, but never, never say &#34;suck&#34;, because you put your intelligence and your knowledge in music in question. Buy this CD, educate yourself and learn from the best  On this double CD set you can listen to a different version of very popular Smoke On The Water and very underrated song When A Blind Man Cries which you will not find on any other CD. And this is just two examples in favor of that release. I don't want to spoil your appetite just listen to it.

B008IJT0CE|4.0|I was recently diagnosed with tinnitus. This is a condition where part of your hearing fails- usually higher pitched tones. The brain stupidly decides it will create that pitch for you- constantly and relentlessly- either in one or both ears. This app creates a customizable set of sounds which cover the noise the brain makes. This is not in your ear. It's from your brain. The app helps me sleep even though it only covers up the tinnitus. There is no cure for this condition.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Very informative, easy to understand and follow, lots of examples, puts everything ya already know and puts all togather so the conclusion is so simple.  Great book!

B00A81NFAS|2.0|The acting was really good, ill give the actors that, but this movie had so much hype and I left completely let down. I personally thought it was really boring and a complete waste of time. Oh well.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|This is nice for helping me fall asleep at night. You can put on background music and even choose what sounds you want in the background.  You can adjust the volume for each individual sound as well. Really nice app.

1616960922|5.0|It's a very short book and a fast read but Brandon did a great job of making it entertaining and he tells a good story that encourages the imagination to visualize the story as it is read.  Great book to read if you have a spare 30 minutes.
B007HACDLK|5.0|As usual Vince has written another great novel. He has been my favorite writer for years now, and the Mitch Rapp novels keep getting better.
B002ISID10|3.0|This album was an OK album. It had amazing guitar, but what happened to music? What happened to good old rock, and not stuff where people were doing this thing where you can't understand them anymore? The heaviest thing I remember to this is people just angrily singing. Not doing what the people in this album did, and kids are now eating this up, especially people who do it for attention at school and for attention from there parents. I mean, what happened people? When did singing become into this?
B00CHI5B7A|5.0|this is not a movie you would let small children watch. It is intense and keeps you on the edge of your seat!
B007TK77QE|1.0|Very gossipy and light. Facets that are good though are that the book does highlight child neglect, and the inability or difficulty some have in raising themselves from rock bottom in society, and societies neglect of these people.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green tells us a wonderful story of young love through an interesting and unique perspective.  Appropriate for all ages, this young adult novel gets an A rating from this 30-something guy!

B00BPWDMP2|5.0|All the songs are awesome!  Big fan of this group since they first started!  Good mix of slow and fast songs
B0038P59A0|4.0|Overall, this was a very good movie. There were a few points were the pacing seems a bit slow and I was ready for the story to pick-up the pace. It was good enough for me to want to see the sequel.
B000062XFG|5.0|Love this season.  Great to see the crew back.  If you liked any of them, you would like this as well.
B007QDNKQA|4.0|Great action film. Wahlberg is almost believable as the would-be patsy who goes through hoops trying to turn the tables on the evil government hacks.

B001BR7CZW|5.0|My son's school choir sang Soul Man in their Spring Concert yet no one in his class had seen the movie. We rented it and it was fun telling him about different parts of Chicago where I grew up. Great movie!
B00BESM14U|5.0|I read the book first and wondered how it would &#34;work&#34; as a movie - it worked better as a movie than it did as a book, in my opinion. It was wonderful!
B0059A149C|2.0|With the cast in this movie, it should have been better.  The story was plodding and slow moving.  The picture quality, however, was excellent.
B001REZMBU|5.0|Well, what can be added to the very fine reviews of this very important and truly sublime album.  Miles Davis once said something to the effect, that great Jazz happens in the silence between the notes.  This is true.  It's all about timing; and Bill Evans has it in spades.  This is, without a doubt, one of the great Jazz albums of all time.
B00005JKGK|5.0|Love this movie.  Get a box of tissue for you will be crying your eyes out!  Wonderful relationship between four women.
B004FRX0MY|4.0|Simple to use, has everything you need. No fuss player. What more can you ask for.<br />I wish they had it for the Windows Phone, but for now Android, iOS and PC's are covered.<br />I'd give it a 5 if they had it for Windows Phone.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I couldn't put it down! The best I've read in a while. I'm on to the next book in the series.
B007SY3CEW|4.0|Fun. I like the variety and the just listen options,,, but the tempo is really strange. a little stilted to me...Somehow it needs to flow more naturally,
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Love the author's use of Ana's \\"inner voices.\\"  They really make you FEEL her reactions.  Love Christian's vulnerability w/o making him seem weak.  Every girl's dream.<br /><br />I never got that creepy feeling, as initially anticipated, when S&M \\"stuff\\" came up - I thought the author was able to keep it from being \\"raunchy\\" but still give you a glimps into that life style.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I really love these headphones, have used them for years. Sony to me has always been quality, and something that will last.

B000W91RUG|5.0|Wonderful DVD my friend totally loved it !!! I will surely buy all of my dvds here for as long as I can
0062218867|3.0|This was not a great book in terms of plot and the worst part of it was, throughout the entire thing I realized I was reading what felt like a largely personalized account of the authors own struggles.  There were numerous references throughout of the summoning dark that afflicted Vimes in the last book and Vimes worrying that he didn't know how much of his thoughts/actions were his own or the result of the demon that plagued him.  This unfortunately just rang too sadly for me of the author and his own current struggles with the \\"demon\\" in his mind, his diagnosis with Alzheimers.  Too sad to be a discworld novel.
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Poorly written and acted. My wife says books are good but somehow they made a mess of it. No Jason Bourne

I had to dowload the whole episode to see the last 20 min from it becuase I left it on pause, I wished it would had pick it up with out hassle.<br /><br />I'm in love with this series, and even that I'm a late fan I'm looking foward for season 6.

B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was lent to me. So I really wasn't sure what the book was about. In the beginning, Sky is in a room trying not to cry and is hysterical. Then Holder grabs her to try to calm her down. My initial thoughts were maybe she was raped and Holder found her. You don't know what has caused her to react that way. Then, we're brought back into time, a couple of months prior to this incident. And then the story begins.... I was completely thrown off in this book. Holder is a complete enigma. In Sky's view of him, he seems to be extremely moody. She never knows which Holder she's going to get. He's aggressive, possessive, stalkish, one moment then considerate, sweet, and friendly the next. Then there's the rumor that he was away for six months for beating a boy who was gay. She just doesn't know what to believe. But one thing she can't deny is her feelings. She feels this connection with him that she has never felt before. She can't walk away from it or him. They then begin to date. And BAM, out of left field comes the truth. Sky discovers she's been unknowingly living a lie. And only Holder can supply her with the truth. This truth will for ever change her life as she knows it. Please read! This is a great story. I will definitely be getting Losing Hope

B00BZXM3VA|5.0|Saw Kurt on Letterman last week.<br />His performance of 'Wakin on a pretty day' was so mesmerizing I immediately bought this album.<br />I did not know of him previously.<br />It is a slow burn.<br />He has a style of singing that is ultra mellow.<br />His guitar playing is full of hooks.<br />The songs are meandering.<br />Yet, there is an appeal that grabs you the first time you hear them and grow more layered  and memorable with further listens.<br />I hear Paul Westerberg, Neil Young and Dylan.<br />Gonna dig deeper in his past recordings.<br /><br />Favorite album of the year.<br /><br />Dave

B004ASNG04|4.0|Interesting to see the long view expressed so clearly and well. Troubling to see the prognostications for a future determined by technologies which are still to,be developed. We can live in hope for the singularity, but this book does not prove its point.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I absolutely love the TV series Game of Thrones that is based off of this book series. So I finally decided to read the books. The writing is incredibly complex and definitely fills in some of the &#34;gaps&#34; of the show. The only drawback to this book was that it was SO LONG. I was not expecting it to be as dense of a story as it was. However, I thought it was a good read overall.

B002VRZEYM|5.0|Some of this I knew, much of it I did not.  This ought to be required viewing for all parents.
B00A0R0CG0|2.0|This is a real sleeper.  I really wish they would have stopped with that squirrel/acorn thing.  The pirates were ridiculous, the plot was nonexistent, all the celebrities character voices were not necessary they only needed the original character voices....I fell asleep twice during this movie and have no idea how it ended but I am not interested in finding out.  With the gorilla pirate riding around on an iceberg for a ship in my opinion they jumped shark and should just let the Ice Age series end here before they do anymore damage and become a total joke.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I'd prefer seeing Joe Manganiello in this role, but Tom pulled it off as usual.  In some parts, the dialogue was a little fast paced (rehearsal-like) as if they were just running through their lines. Overall the plot kept my interest, but like I said, I would have rather been drooling over Joe Manganiello.

B0001MDQ6W|3.0|This is pretty good for fans of Dylan's later years.<br /><br />Watch \\"Newport Live: Newport Folk Festival\\" first. It has much more raw energy.<br /><br />Two tracks I liked the best on this disc were Love Minus Zero/No Limit, and the encore With God on Our Side.

B00004YZFR|2.0|This was pretty bad. I thought I liked the Rolling Stones until I watched it.<br /><br />Then I thought, well, if I don't like the Stones I can still like their music.<br /><br />After this program, I'm not even sure about that.
B00003CX8Y|5.0|Beauty and the Beast was released in theaters on November 13, 1991. Beauty and the Beast mainly tell the story of a Prince who became a hideous beast because he scorned an old peasant who becomes a beautiful enchantress. The enchantress realizes that the Prince selfish, coldhearted and unkind and put a spell on the castle and the residents who live their as well. Several years have past and Belle enters his life when he takes her father captive. Belle agrees to live in the castle as the Beast prisoner in exchange for the release of her father. Over several months there grow to like each other and that is where I am going to end so I don't give away the rest of the story. Unlike other reviews I have written I have given the time length on each one; this DVD is the exception to the rule. This DVD comes with three different versions of Beauty and the Beast: Work In Progress which was released at the New York Film Festival in September of 1991, Original Theatrical Release, and the Special Edition which has the song Human Again in it. My biggest beef with this 2 Disc DVD collection is Disc 2. There is so much repetitive and overlap it is way bother a second disc. The Pencil Version of Human again is play four times. When you get to Mrs. Potts section of the DVD where you The Making of Beauty and the Beast is just and edited version of Origins of Beauty and the Beast in Cogsworth & Lumiere's Library section. Whoever put Disc 2 together must not have had it all there.

B001TAJGO6|3.0|I really wanted to like it more.<br /><br />Maybe it was that annoying female lead, with the different hair colors. Was that supposed to be important, that she had red hair, then blue hair, then green hair?<br /><br />Is that like a \\"costume drama\\" where some people are all excited to see the actress wear different outfits every scene?<br /><br />Sorry but it is just wasted on me.<br /><br />I like story, plot, all those things, not hair colors.<br /><br />I kept thinking, shouldn't I instead be watching Memento again?
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I was wary at first, being an instrumental violin album, and I was told that some songs were like a violin/dubstep fusion. Not liking violin or dubstep, I put it off until the other day. It's opened up a whole new world of listening for me. Her music is like the soundtrack for Chrono Cross, without that nauseating feeling of \\"I'm listening to the soundtrack for Chrono Cross. I hope no one catches me.\\" So yeah, five stars.
0307476073|4.0|WILD written by Cheryl Strayed is a great read.  It is written as though you are talking to someone you know who is just telling her story.  I really enjoyed it and highly recommend it to others.  This young woman is comfortable &#34;in her skin&#34; and tells it like it is.  It took a great amount of courage to do this hike and yet she remains unimpressed with herself.
B00BSKT66A|3.0|It's an app that I've not used yet, but if it works like my iPhone it will do ok for me
B00CL68NOG|4.0|Enjoyed the movie. It did get a little long in some places, but over all very funny. Barbara does a great job!
B008YU0AOE|4.0|Does what i need it to do and it was free. Wish the app came standard on the kindle fire.
B00CL68BK2|4.0|good movie, Would recommend watching.  Quite a deep movie, must pay attention.  Robert Deneiro was good in this movie.  Bradley Cooper is always good to watch!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The third season of Downton Abbey delivers the excellent, no-compromises artistic writing and solid acting performances that we have come to expect (and love).  I would recommend this series and this season to anyone that loves a good drama.  The writing is real and the actors consistently deliver genuine and touching performances; prepare to be invested in the characters - to laugh and cry with them as the twists and turns of their lives unfold.  Without hesitation - five stars.
B006O6FK2W|4.0|Excellent, would recommend, so far without problems. Greetings. Thank you
B00A8ECU24|3.0|This game is one of the best games I have ever played, but it comes with a price. I have to force stop this app A LOT to get it to work properly and fit the screen. Also, there is IAP, but I don't mind that much. If you are willing to have to force stop that app every other day, get it. It is very fun and amazing, it just needs some work with its glitches. Get this app!
B006O6F4O6|4.0|Excellent, would recommend, so far without problems. Greetings. Thank you
B00CL68NOG|4.0|So I can't say I hated the movie, but I didn't love it either. Barbara Streisand was the super-attached, loving (presumably Jewish?) mother to Seth Rogen's character and they made a decent acting pair, but I wasn't convinced. The previews are misleading (as always) in that it looks like a laugh-every-second kind of movie, like maybe The Hangover, but it turned out to a more funny-yet-touching film in the end. If you want a laugh, but are also feeling kind of cheesy, then take a chance with this flick.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|one of the best movies I have ever seen. A good family movie.<br />A good church movie, or home group.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Suzanne Collins racks up another winner , as good as Hunger Games. Moving on to the third book in the series soon, very soon.

B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I love everything in here--it is so interesting to look at and to read.  You won't be disappointed. Very beautifully packaged.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A fun task for the mind all in the spirit of Indiana Jones,  Tomb raider and National Treasure. I cant wait for the sequel.
B003QP4NPE|5.0|This is the most gripping book I have read in over 10 years.<br /><br />I couldn't put it down. The sequel Freedom is a must read.
B005LAIIJY|3.0|It,was ok to much BLOOD for my tast would not let my grandkids whatch it....Think You Lillian Hatfield and Family
B00009NHC5|5.0|I am surprised at how long I had lived my life without having seen this movie.  It is really good. One of the best Alfred Hitchcock films. Timeless
B006LS7DQE|5.0|Great match three/strategy game. First had it for my android phone then got it for my kindle. Was not disappointed. Actually the kindle  version looks and plays so much better.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|I am so sad that I was never able to see this show live, but I now I get to watch it whenever I want. Unfortunately Franco Dragone has nothing to do with the show she now has in vegas. I still watch this and it gives me chills. And there are AMAZING behind the scenes features on the second disc. They take you scene by scene from backstage.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Wonderful graphics. Addictive game-play. Easy way to burn through a couple of hours. You will not regret it. Go buy it!
B0068RHSCW|5.0|I think that most people didn't enjoy this movie because they were expecting a traditional horror movie, and it is really more suspenseful psychological thriller. Really makes you think...
B00AK0X5VQ|5.0|Play as a &#34;thing&#34; that eats smaller things to get bigger. Then you can eat the bigger things. Lots of fun.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|To me this was a formula B grade movie.  The story line was typical; the costumes cheesy and the ending oh so predictable.  The whole thing seemed like something that you would see on network TV on Sunday afternoon.  My friends tell me that I am not the target audience and that the film was made for kids.  However, kids have a more sophisticated media palate than adults so serving them up this pablum and calling it art seems a disservice to the nations youth.  If you ask me (an you did) I think some marketing genius saw how popular the Harry Potter series was and is trying to repeat the success with the Hunger Games series.<br /><br />Watch it if you want, but borrow a copy.  Don't waste your money.
B006E4QCXU|3.0|It is cute. You get about five minutes worth of enjoyment out of it. Then you WILL get bored with it.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|Interesting read.<br />It had some basic concepts about &#34;understanding slavery&#34; that bothered me.<br />I think it is very hard to truly understand (or, really even come close)  the idea of how the slaves &#34;felt&#34; by anyone who doesn't have to even think that they could be owned and that they had not control over their life.<br />This book did get me thinking.
B0000026DJ|5.0|Not a bad track on the whole CD.  i used to listen to this cassette tape as a teenager while at work.  I like his unique lead voice.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I will first mention that I constantly  check the battery hd pro meter to see where the battery's level is. When I notice my kindle battery is below a certain number I wisely charge it. It helps me see what processes use the most battery power.
B000001EHS|5.0|One of the top 5 80's bands.  They are still making good music, but nothing beats the earlier stuff like on this CD.
B003VDY7XE|5.0|I decided to try watching the first episode online: interesting characters. I'm looking forward to seeing the rest of the show.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Great twist on good music.  Great talent.  I can't wait to see these guy in concert the nest time they come to town.
B005LAIIPS|5.0|I have just watched this film for the 5th time(at least)and I feel this film is seriously under-rated. For me it is as good as the original(Identity) and better than 2 & 3. I find Greengrass's films headache inducing... all those jumpy cameras (this comes from a fellow Brit - not that it matters).  Jeremy Renner is completely believable and I hope the franchise is continued. I will certainly go to see it in the cinema and buy the DVD (and the T-shirt).<br /><br />I won't go into the plot details as the film has been around for a while but I saw this film only had a 3.5 rating which for me is too low and I thought I would add my tuppence worth.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Every song is different and has a great feel.  i could listen to this CD in any mood.  I have a collection of about 10 bands from Provo and this one is the best.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I love the suspense of whats going to happen next. I cant help but watch the episodes back to back
B000089RVX|3.0|The CD case came in and was cracked across the front. The clip that holds the CD in was broken as well. This kind of scratched up the CD a little. Haven't noticed it affecting the quality of music. Just a little disappointed. However, Evanescence kicks ass!
B005OYKI1I|4.0|Great action, likeable characters, they were funny and I can't wait for the next installment! I'd definitely recommend this for the sweet cars and the Rock
B007EC27QM|5.0|I have been using it for over a hear and it is one of the few apps I have no complaints about!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|Couldn't wait til I could read a few more pages here and there.  Really hated for this book to end but look forward to book 5.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|Okay, it's love between two people with a few problems. Quirky. Let's get some bad DNA get together and make some more bad DNA. That is really an exciting prospect.
B00BTJMS1A|5.0|I purchased this on Steam a few weeks ago and it was really enjoyable. I think the transition to a touch screen is a fantastic idea and I highly recommend the game
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|The game overall is fun but the lack of coins at startup and the max of 40 after waiting a decade is the only set back in my opinion. Be a little more generous, allow the player to get more achievements and then offer your selling pitch to acquire more coins. At least try it on a limited time trial.
B00AFROVQC|4.0|Author was creative and had some good ideas to begin this series.  I must warn you that the series gets dramatically worse as it moves along.  Her next book in this series is okay.  After that it gets pretty awful.
B00AKKTDJY|2.0|I got this game as the Free App of the Day and have played quite a bit since. I loved the game for the first restaurant or two...then the relentless ads began. Between EVERY SINGLE LEVEL you get a pop-up ad wanting you to upgrade (with a cost  that is 4x more than the game price).  Even worse  I can't even play the \\"bonus\\" restaurant  which is what is supposed to make it \\"Deluxe.\\"  There is a meat grinder, but I have no idea what it is supposed to do. I see a meat patty, by  nothing else happens. You can get through the first level since  it' s the last customer who orders it, but you  won't be able to complete any orders after that. Guess I'll be uninstalling. It was fun while it lasted, but irritation won out in the end.
B00C061I3K|4.0|I have no problems with album. I love it. But really? Cracked jewel case? I&#34;m just gonna switch it with another case but this is ridiculous. It came in a bubble wrapped envelope and all. Disappointing.
B0009FU0ZQ|3.0|The movie was entertaining & enjoyable, but I hated the backgound music - there was too much of it, too loud & too intrusive.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I actually ordered this for my 8 year old.  He played it on our pc, and wanted something more mobile.  Actually compares well to the pc edition and he loves it.  There are days that he'd rather play it on the tablet than the pc.  Overall, a very good buy, as the pc edition was almost 4 times the cost!
B00821PCJS|5.0|Good show. Very reminiscent of Jericho but with aliens. It might be a little slow for some in the beginning but it does get very exciting towards the middle of the season.
B008602KQI|3.0|The Hunger Games is OK, more for the teenage set than for an adult.<br /><br />It is a bit predictable, namely the attractive idealistic youth beset upon by the cruel oppression of a fascist/communist state.<br /><br />The movie is a bit over the top, with a mix of socialist reality and Hollywood glamour and TV talk show.<br />However, the story does get one thinking about life, society, government, and the cinematography is good, with much time spent in the forest--as the selected 24 murder each other one by one--and what could be bad about the forest?<br /><br />Overall, it's okay for an evening's entertainment.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I loved the movie and for the price I got a DVD and Blu-ray copy. I would like to advise other people that be careful when it says digital copy on this purchase you have to go online and download it and it says ultraviolet copy I have no idea what that is but it come on a server and all you get is the abilty to access it on cloud this is something I do not like buying something that in the future could just go away and then you bought something you don't have I like being able to have it in hand and not rely on a company that could go out of business and take your purchase with them
B00AREIAI8|5.0|amazing luv it! it rocks i dont have horses and through this i feel as if i have my own horse! :)
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved this book!  It sucked me in right away from the very beginning, and I had a hard time putting it down every night.  The character development was phenomenal, and the story was completely unpredictable.  It's one of those books you are sad to finish and you think about it every now and again.  Those are the best kind!
B006Z4LOPK|5.0|Great  combination of humor and imaginative action. Unique characters and believable love interests and complications given the nature of the characters involved.
B009NY43NY|3.0|Flashplot: Our favorite telepathic waitress is up to the tops of her cowgirl boots in trouble again in this series finale urban fantasy novel. After using the cluviel dor (fancy fairy magic) to save Sam at the end of the last book, Sookie has both boyfriend problems with Eric and assassin troubles with who knows how many psychos. In fabulous finale fashion, Harris manages to bring back all our favorite characters to solve the mystery of who wants Sookie dead this time around and, of course, to answer her reader's most pressing question: who will Sookie end up with in the end. *Don't worry; I won't spoil it!<br /><br />As a reader: As the dedication states, this book is for the fans. I doubt it could be understood, never mind enjoyed, by anyone unfamiliar to the series. That's as it should be. Dead Ever After is the thirteenth book in this popular series; Harris doesn't need to appease or appeal to new readers. I really enjoyed seeing all the principal players from the series make an appearance in this book. And although Sookie's own reminiscing reads as much like an author's goodbye as a character's thoughts, as a long-time fan of the series, I enjoyed this too.<br /><br />As a writer: One thing that threw me as a fan of the series and as a writer who always admired Harris's ability to capture Sookie's voice was the new style of narration. The first dozen books were all told exclusively from Sookie's first person point of view. Although at times that left the reader in the dark for a little too long, Sookie's honest and sarcastic voice was a huge draw for readers. This final book jumped around from first person to third person omniscient, with headings to alert the reader to the changes. Perhaps just because it was new to the series, I felt it came off as an obvious device to work in plot elements that couldn't be told as easily in the first person. I found it jarring, and I was a little disappointed Harris resorted to such a device in the final book.<br /><br />Bottom line: This wasn't the best book in the Sookie series, nor was it the worst. It was the last, and, as the last, it had what readers will want: reminders of all we loved along the way and some closure for our favorite mind-reading, sun-loving Bon Temps girl.tom line: This wasn't the best book in the Sookie series, nor was it the worst.

B0060MYM3S|5.0|Once we watched season 1 on the DVDs we got at the library, we couldn't wait a minute longer for season 2. Well worth the money.
B005TBN04S|2.0|I didn't think this hangover was even remotely funny.  The first one I laughed so much but this one I hardly laughed at all.  Maybe #3 will be funnier.
B005544V6A|5.0|You are hooked from the first episode and you can't deny those two heart throbbing men in suits! I think this show is for both male and female, especially couples ...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I read this in March 2012- This was way better than the first book. I laughed so much between the text messages that were sent.  Mr. Grey had his hands full with his love interest! You gotta read the whole trilogy- it was money well spent for me!
B00C061I3K|1.0|Just received the new album and was so excited to listen to it and what a dissapointment. If I wanted to go to sleep I would count sheep. The guys have lost their touch or have been misguided by corporate greed. They should go back to their own studio and forget all the fluff of an orchestra. I can not believe how bad this album is and how slow the music is. How slow do they expect people to dance??
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read this in March 2012- I almost quit reading this in the middle, it is not for the faint of heart! I am so glad I finished the book, so I could read the 2nd, and 3rd books!  It was so hilarious the relationship and the text messages the 2 main characters sent each other!  This trilogy is my all time fav books of the thousands of books I have read!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|You are not going to read this. No one is . The thousands of good reviews will drown it out. But this is a good book. Buy it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is seriously addictive. Fun and bright and easy to play. Lots of unlockable content to me keep you hooked. Overall very fun
B000001FT0|5.0|One of my favorite records. Steve Winwood at his very best in a time the Music business were  poor. Thanx
B005H9B44A|4.0|Oh, Loki. You're just a messed up kid. You can still turn it around!<br /><br />Seriously, if you can watch this movie without feeling at least a little bit of sympathy for Loki, you're a MONSTER.<br /><br />Overall, fun, sort of silly movie that doesn't take itself too seriously.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Supernatural is and always has been amazing if you do not like the season finale please remember the show has been planned out until season 10 so there is a reason for everything..........<br />excellent show...writing...acting and directing
B00004YA66|5.0|Great movie!  Great condition. Arrived on time. Thank you.
B0033H7VI6|5.0|This is an amazing knife. It's not the sharpest out of the box, but the quality, and design have made it my new personal friend in the woods. The heft is a very confidence building characteristic
B00BQ1DBUS|5.0|I am a lifelong fan of Rod Stewart.  This album is SO GOOD.  Don't miss it!  Mandolin, Guitar, Harmonica, Piano and HIS VOICE!  This proves 110% that when Rod sits down with pen and writes his own music that he can NAIL IT!<br /><br />Thank You to Rod Stewart for your entire career in the gift of music - original and cover - your voice has always been so soothing to me during my life over the years.  A song for every emotion I have ever felt.<br />I can tell that you are in a good place in your life right now as it shows in your writing.  Kudos!!!  Ten Stars!!! :)
B008Q09K2U|3.0|I have been reading quite a lot of Nelson Demille books, but this time it takes forever to get to where the book gets interesting. Also the re-use of characters from other books (paul Brenner) seems to be a shortcut from &#34;inventing&#34; new and interesting persons. The fact that the personality of Paul Brenner is very much alike the character of John Corey, it seems a little &#34;cheap&#34;.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Like a modern day Robinson Cruesoe set on Mars. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys realistic sci fi.
B00BGIBVRG|2.0|If you like movies such as Walk The Line, American Pie, Beer Wars - this movie is for you.<br />It was not funny like Bridesmaids, although it was from the same producers.<br />Most of the movie is hearing a married couple bicker (who needs more of that if you are married?) with occasional humorous interjections. I turned the movie off about 3/4 way through, never to return.
B009FZFONO|4.0|It seems every episode follows the same formula:<br /><br />Opening - Awesome, exciting event. 2 minutes.<br />Middle - Boring. Talking and nothing happens. 40 minutes.<br />Ending - Awesome, exciting, cliffhanger even that gets you hooked for the next episode. 1 minute.<br /><br />Basically this:<br /><br />http://jpegy.com/images/uploads/2012/10/Pretty-much-every-episode-of-The-Walking-Dead.jpg
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|This song is amazing. There's no other way around it. I am Daft Punk believer now. And good to see Pharrell Williams getting work again.
B005JS6RQO|5.0|love this movie and i use it in my class with my medical students, it is very educational  when teaching about HIV
B007DIQC90|5.0|I think anyone looking to get this album would say Of Monsters of Men have some great songs. So what I really like about this album is how it just fits well together so well. I find very few bands out together full albums but My Head is an Animal is not tue case
B007IK44CK|5.0|Good movie with a nice bit of humor to really make it an enjoyable experience and not the same ol' mission impossible
B00BRBIA6C|5.0|The cd is full of great tracks.  Anyone who is an Agnetha fan will instantly recognize that beautiful voice.  Once in a lifetime does a singer of her caliber come along, and she will be remembered for generations to come.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm not the fastest of readers, but this story line was so easy to read and captivating, I flew right through it in no time!
1476733953|5.0|I have never in my 24 years (yeah, I am still young haha) had a story that made me set it down so I could go think about what I have read. After getting through the &#34;first part&#34; of this masterpiece I needed to step away and walk outside. It is an incredible journey (so far) and I can not wait to sink my teeth into the second part. I highly advise giving this a shot.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|After falling in love with Les Mis via the DVD of this concert version (see my comments there), I decided I had to have the soundtrack for those long commutes.  I'm glad I did.  This CD conversion is better than the DVD.  On the DVD, some voices are too soft, but on the CD, all voices are evenly balanced and crystal clear.  With headsets or in the car (nearest I get to surround sound), every voice, every word, even breaths and sobs are heard; voices are nicely balanced with the orchestra as well.  A true pleasure for the ears.  The &#34;acting&#34; through song holds your attention; in comparison, the Broadway CD, while nicely sung, is flat and expressionless.  The only things I don't like about the 10th Anniversary Concert CD are Colm Wilkinson's squeaky pips at the end of some songs and the applause.  I know this is a sound track of a live performance, but I found it disconcerting to have loud applause as the very first sound and after particularly emotional numbers.  I would rather contemplate in silence after such numbers.  At least they could have toned it down a bit; they didn't eliminate the balloon bursting during &#34;Castle On A Cloud.&#34;  (What a trooper; she barely flinched!)  I  found Les Mis to be strangely cathartic after the Boston Marathon bombing.<br /><br />I have to comment about the 2012 movie.  The story is more complete than either the 10th Anniversary Concert or the Broadway CD.  There are visual scenes that move the story along instead of the &#34;sing-talking&#34; used in the play.  I actually like the hokey slanted camera angles and close ups, the singing live on camera instead of studio dubbed, and the acting.  I like the changes in the finale scene:  emphasizing Cosette as the source of Jean's strength and love; having Colm Wilkinson/the Bishop meet Jean, &#34;leading him to salvation.&#34;  Love the harmony.  In the play, I actually never realized Jean had died.  However the overall singing hurts my ears:  Russell Crowe can't even &#34;sing-talk&#34; let alone really sing; Amanda Seyfried sounds like a goat bleating.  There are times when Hugh Jackman should have gone into a quiet falsetto instead of shouting.  The show stoppers are Samantha Barks and Eddie Redmayne, especially Eddie.  I could listen to him sing and watch him act all day.  My ideal would be to put the 10th Anniversary Concert soundtrack to the visual of the movie.4;sing-talk&#34; let alone really sing; Amanda Seyfried sounds like a goat bleating.

B00BTJMS1A|5.0|This game sucks time better than any game I have ever seen.  You will love how your life just slips away with mindless fun.  You will never know that important things that mean everything will be nothing because you will be just playing this game for hours.  I love wasting my life playing this incredible game.
B0031RS74K|5.0|I was excited to read the book. I had seen the movie first, which of course led to making the book more interesting in this case. The book delves into the psyche of Rebecca and is a very enjoyable read overall.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|Very good movie, it had action, comedy, emotions, and love. It was good you have to watch it yourself or I would give it away!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|The best part of reading Jane Austen is finding all the &#34;hidden&#34; nuances to the story that a movie cannot depict! This is by far one of my most favorite books of all time.
1878424777|3.0|Good basic life principles in a different presentation. Maybe reaffirming if you are off track but have a base of spiritual living. Good if you don't and are looking for a place to start.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I loved this book. As far as romances go this one captures you. I enjoyed reading it in one sitting.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|I found this the least interesting book in the trilogy. By the time it was over, I'm not sure I really cared about any of the characters anymore. But I did finish it in a day, so it still held my interest.
B007SXB498|5.0|Jane Austen's talent for character development is uncanny. I enjoy how each character becomes an intricate part of the story.

B000FBJFSC|3.0|Hard to know people lived this way such a short time ago, and still do.  Sorry there are so many less fortunate.
B003DNH6DK|5.0|Loved &#34;The Blind Side&#34;! It was heart-warming, inspiring and best of all, a true story about an extremely caring, determined woman, Leigh Anne Tuohy, and her wonderful family who opened their hearts and home to a &#34;forgotten&#34; young boy whose life could have taken a very different direction without their love and support. Instead, Michael Oher excelled in school and in sports and is now an NFL Baltimore Raven. &#34;The Blind Side&#34; opens your eyes to the effect that basic human kindness and selflessness can have upon someone's life and it does so with humor and compassion. (And Sandra Bullock is terrific!)
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Michael Buble has a very listenable voice and I enjoy that he has pretty well stuck with the older songs which have meaning to the words and his voice well suits them as did Frank Sinatra's.  I have many of his albums and will continue to buy them.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|Great movie! This is one you could watch with the men in your family. It's not full of action but it's not a chick flick either.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|A Dan Brown thriller through and through. Once you start reading you will not be able to put it down. This would make an awesome movie too!! If you have not read his &#34;Digital Fortress&#34;, you must read it as well, it too will keep you on the edge of you chair. Dan does NOT disappoint.
B003V1WST6|4.0|This is the perfect read for those times you just want a break from reality. I have never been one for &#34;chick literature&#34; but this one was a welcome surprise. I can't wait to read the entire series!!! Loved it!
B002JVWRAY|5.0|there is a lot of tension during the season, also good spirits despite how badly they spend the winchester brothers.<br />I saw the entire season in less than a week
B00AH8FTT2|2.0|What a disappointing read.  This is just a a money making book to make sure that you will buy the next one that Jeffrey Archer is obviously writing.  Last time I purchase a Jeffrey Archer his earlier books were so entertaining
B003L77GGU|4.0|a season of transition, after the intense season 5, is better enjoy each chapter for itself  than as a unit season<br />i loved the extras
B005K0HDGE|3.0|This is a good time travel novel, in which King explores history, and what catastrophic results could occur if the past were changed in any way. I enjoyed the love interest side story more than the main plot line, and wished there was less narrative and more dialog in some places.  I would definitely read it once.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|Bought this for my husband from our 2 yr old for his birthday. He had already seen the movie and loved it. Now both of them love it. Great purchase :)
B0078X2LKY|3.0|well....very very short..could have had more of a story in it...but, because I am such an entertaining story teller, my children thought it was funny...so...ahhh....us
0060555661|5.0|I understand 100% why this book is considered an investing classic. It is written pretty timelessly and could be applied to any time period. It is older, so for a teenager like me, it is somewhat difficult to understand because I only really know investing from the past 5 years. The Jason Zweig commentary is somewhat helpful, but is probably unnecessary. I don't really understand how he is qualified to speak with the ranks of Graham. But his points did clarify a few things for me. I would have to recommend the point to anyone that has not read it.
B008YKGQR4|2.0|This app is not user friendly and annoying......needs a lot of work for me to consider it useful.......it doesn't even format correctly on the page.....

B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I thought this movie was hilarious, if a bit gross, but it has a good heart, and it was exceptionally well crafted. The people trashing this have a surprising lack of a sense of humor. This was a good movie. Yes, a bit low-life at times, but still with the heart in the right place.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved it!!! Cant wait to start the third one to see whats going to happen in the new district 13 >:o
B00004TS0E|5.0|I grew up on this movie. It was one of my favorites as a kid, and I bought it for a friend who felt the same way. I was so excited to find it - it isn't an easy one to find in stores.

B00CBT04D6|5.0|George Roy Hill's THE STING is a highly loved film. This film was an event when it was first released. Sentimentally, it is George Roy Hill's sentimental follow up to his BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID.  Once again Paul Newman and Robert Redford are teamed and once again this film is truly an event just as BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID was. However, the overall production creates a certain cinematic quality much different from BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID. Visually, it is claustrophobic, yet this only enhances the dramatics. I am amazed at how little screen time Paul Newman has, yet his card playing and hard drinking Henry Gondorff visually define this film. Certainly this film brings Robert Redford back into the film-going public's eye. The plot is minimal and the pay-off, once viewed, is quite surprising, full of humor, drama and suspense. Robert Shaw as Doyle Lonnegan, the mark, is memorable and brings a level of believability to the plot as it unravels. The entire cast is impeccable and includes Charles Durning, Ray Walston, Eileen Brennan and Leonard Barr among others. Most memorable are Scott Joplin's ragtime compositions, adapted by Marvin Hamlisch. \\"The Entertainer\\" gained immortality from THE STING. THE STING is a film characterized by sentimentally endearing characters, dramatics, music and fun.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|Loved that this worked well on both of my Android phones. I now don't have one anymore, but it was worth it to have a great game on my phone!
B00CS7ZIHI|5.0|I have been following them since the beginning and I am amazed as always. They may be changing, but always good. I can never get enough. Brilliant. Full of emotion. Love it from beginning to end. What is a band that doesn't continually grow and explore the new? Love it!
B001FB4W0C|5.0|I love this show! I got addicted in college and still love this today. Having it on DVD is great so that I can just watch the episodes that I want to when I want to.
0756407915|2.0|Flipping through the book, and look at that. 3 chapters are printed upside down! You had one job, printer man. Going to be very difficult to read. Good book, but buy from somebody else.

B00BCX2F66|5.0|This is a great case. Fits perfectly, just like you'd expect since it's made by the same manufacturer as the phone. The only issue is that you have to hold it open while you take a picture, because obviously if you fold it back it covers the lens.

1932907009|5.0|This book is fun to read, and organized in an easy-to-scan way. The way it classifies major story types is very helpful in writing awareness and in making writing choices. The &#34;beat sheet&#34; which break s stories down into parts is also very useful. Highly recommended.
B004GJYROG|5.0|I am a amazon shopper so my expectations are high for the products. I received Space Jam like two or three days after I ordered it. Speedy delivery and it was packaged nicely. The product was just the way the description described it to be.

B00CHVJODE|3.0|I found animation in The Croods up to the standards I expect from Dreamworks: beautifully drawn, great personalities in all the characters (especially the animals), with lots of clever visuals scattered throughout (sabre-tooth mice?!?). And that chase scene with the egg was hilarious - \\"Release the baby!\\"<br /><br />In many ways, though, it came across as predictable. Over-protective parents, teenage daughter who finds a really nice boy, family rapprochement in the end. You know, the usual.<br /><br />This time, the family appeared to be Neandertals (the girl had shoulders on her like a blacksmith) and the really nice boy might have been a more modern human type. There's a nice intersection with recent science there: modern humans apparently interbred with Neandertals, and there was every indication of some breeding in the young couple's future. Also, the girl (named Eep) had red hair, and at least some Neandertals are known from DNA analysis to have had red hair.<br /><br />Other than those few points, however, I found this utterly forgettable. I won't ask for those two hours of my life back, but I can't think of a reason to see it again.<br /><br />-- wiredweird

B00BI6SSMC|5.0|Iron and Wine have been nothing less than captivating all throughout their discography. It's often surprising that one man (with the occasional accompaniment of his family members and various other musicians) can pull off writing songs and creating albums as beautiful as he has. \\"The Creek Drank The Cradle\\" was the quiet yet sweet debut, \\"Our Endless Numbered Days\\" was the flawless second acoustic effort (and my personal favorite), \\"The Shepherd's Dog\\" was an unforeseen step into experimental territory and one hell of an album, \\"Kiss Each Other Clean\\" was a little underwhelming after the excellence of \\"Shepherd's Dog\\" but at the same time, slightly more jazzy and focused and still a great effort, and for Sam Beam's fifth LP, we get \\"Ghost on Ghost\\", which I have to say is his most complex work yet. Here, he indulges further with the jazz sound, especially on songs like \\"Lovers' Revolution\\" and \\"Singers and the Endless Song\\", but what is most present is the sunniness and relaxed sound that most of the songs have. In fact, this album is most directly related to \\"Our Endless Numbered Days\\" for that reason. Sure, it's not subtle and acoustic, but it's just as gorgeous. Songs like \\"Caught in the Briars\\", \\"Joy\\", \\"Low Light Buddy of Mine\\", \\"New Mexico's No Breeze\\", and \\"Baby Center Stage\\" are just a few of the standouts on here, all layered with Sam's usual, sometimes rambly poetry (since \\"Shepherd's Dog\\", that has become his lyrical style), and wonderful music to wrap it up in a nice little package.<br /><br />I felt I needed to get my two cents out about this album because there are far too many low ratings for such a great album. Yes, \\"Ghost on Ghost\\" is a great album. It's not an instant classic like \\"Our Endless Numbered Days\\" or \\"The Shepherd's Dog\\", but it's pretty close in my opinion. No matter what musical style Sam tries out, I'll always be listening and enjoying what he has to offer. My advice for anyone who is skeptical about picking up this album: if you likedany other Iron and Wine albums, give this one a spin. Don't listen to the negative reviewers on here, and don't listen to the critics. Just decide for yourself whether or not you like it. Keep an open mind and I'm sure you'll find it to be an enjoyable listen that you'll keep returning to time and time again.
159514188X|4.0|This is not a book that you want to read before bedtime because it will not tuck you in serenely. Hannah's story doesn't deal with murders, robbers, or spirits; yet, her story will keep you up at night thinking of all her reasons why she decided to end her life.<br /><br />The moment Clay picks up the package that was left on his doorstep, I felt as if I was right by his side, listening to the tapes and Hannah's story. I know a lot of people did not like Hannah's character, and they see her as whinny and over dramatic. But truth of the matter is, she felt really alone. She didn't understand why her peers were so mean to her, and why she couldn't find someone to confide in. I feel like all of us have felt alone once or twice in our lives, wondering when everything was going to turn around. Yet, what happens when things don't seem to get better and instead are actually getting worse?<br /><br />As much as Clay wants to know why Hannah decided to end her life, he was also afraid and wonders why he is on this list. He doesn't remember ever being mean to Hannah, and he automatically feels guilty for some unexplained reason. I mean, she has sent him these tapes for a reason right?<br /><br />Imagine if someone you knew commited suicide, and let you know that YOU were one of the reasons why this person decided to end their life. How would you react? And how would you live the rest of your life, knowing you played such a significant role without even knowing it?<br /><br />Hannah's reason for Clay being on the list, was a bit strange to me. I won't say much to spoil the book, but I will say that before dismissing it-really think about it. It isn't as complex as you may think.<br /><br />Once I opened this book, I spent the night walking around town with Clay trying to solve Hannah's mystery, and I have to say that it is one walk I will never forget.
B002G01EPC|5.0|I was fortunate enough to find this figure for a reasonable price recently. I am glad I did because I did not want to pay the secondary market price. So I'm lucky.<br /><br />I really like the SH Figuarts line. These are literally the best DB figures you can find. They come with interchangeable hands, faces, arms,and unique accessories.<br /><br />I hope they make a few more characters. The price is a bit crazy on these things even for normal retail. But they are Japanese imports, come with tons of extras, well packaged, and well crafted. You get what you pay for, and these things are awesome.
0345543971|5.0|If you liked the first 2 books, this book is when George RR Martin steps up his game.  So many storylines finally pay off, and despite being incredibly long, the pacing is good enough to keep you reading long into the night.<br /><br />Once you finish this book, however, I would suggest taking a long break before jumping into book 4... Because the pacing slows down immensly in A Feast for Crows, and you don't want to jump straight into it out of book 3.<br /><br />For those following the HBO series, the current season (Season 3), covers about 50-60% of this book, and the rest won't come until season 4.  So if you don't want to spoil Season 4, you should probably only read half of this book (impossible :P), or wait until next year.
B006LSZECO|2.0|I was very eager to read this book after hearing great things about it from a radio broadcast. Flynn did a great job in the middle. There were times when I wanted a scene to continue, that how good it was. Then came the end. Boy what a disappointment. I felt like I wasted my time. The ending was weak and left me feeling empty. Don't except a big ending because this is not one of those kind of novels.

B0064MPXFA|4.0|But I got sucked in and watched seasons 1 - 3 for free (Prime) and then paid forty bucks for season 4.  Is it worth it? I don't know, it's cable, you know?  Everything is solved in under 45 minutes.  Passes the time.
B007BVOEPI|4.0|Intensive first season. Second got boring. I still recommend the show.  As go to the second season the drama get to complicate to follow up so lost part of the entertainment part.

There are many references that I didn't understand, particularly those referring to French history or locales, but the story is compelling and Hugo's observations on individuals and their relationship to the society they live in are wonderful.<br /><br />Be prepared to take some time with the book, because it is long and the story unfolds at a leisurely pace, with plenty of background information on the characters.  Les Miserables is another example of why classics are a cut above everything else.  Great read.
B000FBJFSC|5.0|Just when you think things can't get any worse they do yet Angela survives.  This would be a tear jerking novel if it weren't for the devastating fact that it was real.  A book I will always have in my library.  I think the only unfortunate thing was that they tried to make a movie of the book.  It was a awful and the truly unfortunate thing is that some will have only seen the movie and will never read the book, while those who read the book are sorry they ever watched the movie.
B0043JDUNS|4.0|Love robert Downey jr<br />Movie is action packed. If you liked the first one this is a must see. Just saw the third one awesome!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|In my opinion Avengers is the best super heroe movie at the moment. Excellent cast and great action scenes. I dont get tired of watching it.
0670026182|4.0|This is one of the most beautiful cookbooks I have ever owned/seen.  The page layouts are a feast for the eyes.  I have made about five recipes from this book.  I made them in all in one day and was absolutely exhausted.  The problem with some of the recipes is the time and extra steps that Katie has one go through.  If you can figure out how to skip some steps its great, otherwise very time consuming.  That said, all of the recipes tasted fantastic.
B004NOH9LW|5.0|I did not realize I could download a rental from Amazon.  It was easy to do and I loved the movie.  I enjoyed how they wove the 3 different stories in and out of each other as they built towards the conversion at the end.  It did leave me wanting more which is always a good thing?!?!
B00COGZ8FU|2.0|I wonder what Tom Cruise was thinking. Is he so self absorbed that he couldn't have any other stars in his movie? Sure, everyone needs a break but the acting was terrible, the plot (I realize based on a book) was worse! I'm not a fan of Cruise anyway but thought I could like Reacher since it is supposed to be action filled. I was bored.
B008FSCNTK|2.0|I love this woman, but this cd was the worse I have heard from her. I will always be your fan!
B000JMKTLO|2.0|I've heard that this is the author's first novel, and that makes sense to me because it reads like a first novel.  That is, it's too much.  Too gritty, too dark, too predictable.<br /><br />I do occasionally enjoy dark, gritty books (such as Generation Loss by Elizabeth Hand), but there's a point at which I lose patience with a novel's increasing depravity.  In Sharp Objects, everyone and everything is so horrible it simply cannot be believed.  By the end of the book (which I guessed early one), I was rolling my eyes.<br /><br />Camille, the protagonist, wasn't my favorite character, either.  I first I thought she was simply spoiled and whiny (\\"Boo hoo...I'm so rich and my mother doesn't love me...\\"), then I came to like - or at least tolerate - her when more of her history was revealed.  But then I went back to loathing her.  I'm sorry, but when someone insists on destroying herself and her relationships, I give up.<br /><br />Most of the other characters were walking cliches.  Mean girls who grew up into mean women.  Fat, ugly girls who end up as miserable losers.  Small towns that are petty and in which everyone leads a life of quiet desperation...  Every cliche that ever existed ends up in this book.<br /><br />Despite all of that, however, there are moments of genius.  The setting (Missouri) was wonderfully rendered and very realistic.  The book remained a page-turner (even though I guessed the ending early on).  And the book was creepy.  Really, really creepy.<br /><br />I've heard better things about Flynn's other books, and I do plan on reading her later works.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|I saw this film in the theater when it first came out and immediately fell in puppy love with Julie Andrews!  I have watched this movie many times, and even with my grand kids.  This edition is a classic and well worth the price.  Nicely boxed and a treasure you can pass from one generation to another.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|This is one of the most beautifully filmed stories ever. Unfortunately, the story is old and especially weak in this telling.  The opening of the story is fine and has some unique qualities:  A crippled soldier has a second chance to experience working legs through a mind transfer into a tall alien on a distant planet.  Then real problems start:  Humans are there to mine the rare element, \\"unobtanium\\"?! Not funny.  It floats in air, but the humans want the motherlode that is buried under the natives' sacred tree.  There are mountains of the stuff floating in the air that could be mined without disturbing the humanoid natives, but that would eliminate the conflict that moves the story.  The evil military and industrial partners decide to destroy the sacred tree and kill the natives.  No moral dilemma here for them.<br /><br />The visual creation that is the alien planet with its wild species is fantastic. It's too bad the story is abominable.  Worth watching once for the beauty and the pain.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|I have truly enjoyed these DVDs, but then again I cannot get enough of The Godfather series.  This set has alot of footage you don't get to see in other editions.  Well worth it if you are a Godfather nut like me.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|I was kinda like Mission Impossible and he even makes a reference to this. Did not go over-board on the rating as it was not one that I would over and over again.
B00BUCW54Q|5.0|Loved this movie. There were a few predictable spots in the movie but it was a great action film with a good solid story line. Enjoyed watching Reacher (Tom Cruise) put all the pieces together. Am a huge fan of Tom Cruise and Robert Duvall acting together so that was an added bonus for me. Think they have great screen presence together. Am not that familiar with the actress who played the defense attorney for James Barr but she did a great job too. Loved her expressions. Loved the scene with the bad guys in the alley where we first see the main bad guy boss and the &#34;things stay done&#34; conversation. The attack on Reacher and corresponding bathroom beat down was hilarious. Action, humor, great actors. Definitely recommend this one.
B002APU580|5.0|This movie is just the right amount of romance and comedy. I enjoyed it so much that I have watched to 4 times now.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|It's a great read by a great author who managed to get his work out there sans publisher... An inspiring story of its own. I certainly look forward to his future work.
B0095ZQ36G|4.0|This was definitely a moving story about a dramatic encounter between men involved in the incredible circumstances of the World War II air war between Germany and the western allies.  It is written in a simple and, therefore, believable manner.  I enjoyed reading  it very much, but I wouldn't call it a page-turner.  It is a sobering reminder of just how terrible war is for everybody and how some people can come out of it and still be somehow better people for their experiences.
0062238310|5.0|I loved the live productions and obtained the DVD Set for Season 1 along with the accompanying wonderful book.  In my view, having the script completes the package and enhances the understanding of what the entire portrayal of life was like both upstairs and downstairs in early 20th century in an established first class (my American term) Aristrocratic home in England.  This book contains the detailed script of both the directives and the actor's contributions.  Julian Fellowes explains the basis for developing the story and how the supurb cast members lent flesh to each scene.  I personally replayed my DVD's as I went along with the script so I could see the words put into action.  This approach is strongly recommended because it adds to the enjoyment of the book.  While we wait in America for the release of Season 4 and the publication of the Season 2 Script, this book is highly recommended for enjoyment by any Downton Abbey enthusiast.

B0046B8GEQ|4.0|This is a pleasant and funny animated feature without adult baggage that often litters on the screen. The relationship between the antagonist and his father was not fully developed but may be a good thing: it shouldn't have been alluded to. Otherwise, it was a well developed story line.
0345529057|1.0|G.R.R is a writing God-no actually he might be God. The GOT series is incredible and everyone should read it BUT Amazon needs to allow the titles to be lent out. Not many people have time to read through one of these bad boys in 2 weeks (and if you do-props (either you slept very little or did little else- probably both). With that being said, it is in Amazon's and Mr. Martin's best interest to make these titles available for a limited time encouraging the said borrower to buy! Come on Amazon!

0307887448|3.0|Ready Player One suffers from many problems. Cline's writing is less than stellar. The plot is straightforward and often predictable. The characters simple caricatures. Despite these weaknesses, the book is generally entertaining and is definitely worth a look if you fall into its target audience.<br />  Unfortunately, the worst of the novel's problems rears its head in the first third or so of the book. Cline is setting  the stage for the meat of the story, and is therefore working to establish his characters' personalities and abilities. This section is awkward and often cringe-worthy.  Things improve substantially after the novel's first plot twist a third of the way into the book, but Cline's inexperience as a writer bubbles up every now and then in the later chapters.<br />  The book as a whole also lacks an especially deep plot or diverse moral plane. The \\"bad guys\\" literally kill kittens, while the \\"good guys\\" are very clearly good guys. The plot is entertaining and often funny, but don't expect the depth of Salinger or Camus.<br />  The book really shines in the nitty-gritty details. As advertised, Ready Player One is chock-full of references to everything from classics like Monty Python and Joust to obscure Japanese TV shows. Cline goes to great lengths to make the book authentic and it pans out beautifully in his favor. The shallow plot is made up for in the fathoms and fathoms of depth to the setting of the novel.<br />  A final thing to remember when considering this novel's merits: Ready Player One is not only Cline's first novel, it's also of the first novels of its kind. It's not perfect, but it's breaking new ground. Considering the circumstances under which it was written, you've got to cut it some slack.<br />  In the end, whether or not you should buy this book depends on whether you're the right audience for it. If you'd count yourself outside the realm of hardcore geeks and gamers, you might want to pass on it. If you're hankering for a dose ofnostalgia over the 80s or retro videogames, Ready Player One is the nerdgasm that you're looking for.
0547569653|5.0|Scott is an amazing person/athlete.  This book wont tell you how to train or how to win ultras.  But it will inspire you to get out and push your own limits.

1451697686|5.0|After following the zero waste blog for some tmie, I purchased this book not fully aware of what more Bea Johnson might have to offer. I was delightfully surprized at the wealth of useful information in this book! It's amazing that in this day and age most people still beleive that our planet can indefnitely sustain the level of waste we produce in this country alone. This book motivated me to expand my own zero waste efforts by identifying areas where I could further reduce my trash/consumption. I am grateful Bea Johnson has done all of the zero waste homework for us and was generous enough to share her blood sweat and tears.

B001J8R8RA|5.0|If you like the Red Album (and I love this album), then the best way to hear it is on vinyl. You hear much more and it is overall a much better listening experience. The gatefold sleeve is beautifully done and very heavy-duty, the insert is equally artistic and aesthetically pleasing, and the LPs themselves are excellent. This is a VERY good pressing. The discs are HEAVY 180 gram 45 RPM LPs. They play beautifully. I'm exceptionally pleased with this album on vinyl. My ONLY complaint is that the LPs come in cheap paper inner-sleeves. Do yourself a favor, and buy some Mobile Fidelity inner sleeves or some plastic-lined paper sleeves. This way, you'll avoid paper scratches, paper dust, etc. from contaminating this spectacular vinyl release.
B002NJWHHA|4.0|My daughter has read two of the books and I remembered that they made a movie about the first one years ago.  We watched it together and totally enjoyed it.  I'm not sure why a sequel was never made.  If you like these kind of fantasy movies you could do a lot worse.

B00BESJYAY|5.0|My kids love surfing and while this is a great surfing movie, it's also a great story.  Very nicely done.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Edgar Rice Burroughs, best known for his Tarzan books, produced one of the early science fiction series in his stories of Civil War veteran John Carter's adventures on Mars. Those familiar with Burroughs' original stories will get an extra kick out of this movie, which brings to life fairly faithfully the Tharks, nine-foot-tall warriors with four arms who find themselves caught in the middle of a perpetual war between the city-states of Zodanga and Helium; the human-like residents of those cities; and the variety of exotic creatures that provide transport, entertainment in the combat arena, and even companionship.<br /><br />Burroughs' tales were cutting-edge science fiction nearly a hundred years ago, based on a Mars craze ignited by wealthy amateur astronomer Percival Lowell and his vision of a canal-crossed Martian landscape which he convinced himself he could see through his telescope in Flagstaff, Arizona, a telescope which he had custom built for his purpose of studying Mars.  Although somewhat quaint by today's standards, Burroughs' luridly illustrated stories were influential for many years in stimulating the imaginations of youthful readers.  Among them was a Brooklyn boy who stood in a vacant lot staring at what he thought was Mars, fervently wishing to be transported telepathically to \\"Barsoom\\", Burroughs' name for the Red Planet.  This young boy was Carl Sagan, who grew up to be a famous astronomer, and a master of popularizing astronomy for the masses.<br /><br />Attempts at putting Barsoom on film had always foundered due to the impossibility of adequately depicting the characters and the physical environment of the Mars stories. Now, with CG animation and Blu-ray high definition anything is possible, and Disney has done a great job of creating a realistic environment for Burroughs' vision of Mars. If this film had been made ten or even five years ago it would have been a sensation, but now the movie-going public is sated with spectacular CG films. Nonetheless, John Carter provides a lavish and moving account of the exploits of one of the earliest heroes of science fiction. It is well worth a visit to the arid landscapes of Barsoom to experience the imagination of Edgar Rice Burroughs.
0880796863|1.0|This is definitely the most readily available and conveniently priced Rider-Waite deck here on Amazon, but you'd be better off looking for a different deck.

B00A4W3AJC|5.0|In one sense it is a cinematic theatrical showcase for Denis Levant, a tour-de-force, while at the same timer it is a homage to movies, Carax's own included. It works on so many levels at once that I look back on it in amazement: Every \\"job\\" a reflection of the variety of the roles that are played in the movies, and that we also play in our lives, every skit, a brilliant, unique take on cinematic stories and visual art forms that we are familiar with, but at the same time full of contemporary, surreal twists and commentaries, or juxtapositions that border on genius.<br /><br />First, It was a tour de force surreal performance piece by Denis Levant. Second, it was an ode to a wide variety of different kinds of cinema, stories and characters. But more than anything, i saw the \\"film characters\\" as symbolic of the different \\"parts we play\\" (metaphorically) in the course of our own lives, even, sometimes, during the course of each and every day.

0316223239|5.0|I started reading ROOM when the subject matter was a bit too topical.  News broke that three women from Ohio had just been discovered being held captive by a man, locked in his house for almost 10 years.  One of the women bore a child while in captivity.  ROOM was published three years prior and is about a 19-year-old girl who is abducted and forced to live in a converted shed in the back of a man's house.  While there, she gets pregnant by the man and gives birth to a boy she names Jack.  The story of ROOM is told from Jack's perspective at five years old.  To protect Jack's innocence, \\"Ma\\" raises Jack to believe that the room that they live in (\\"Room\\") is all the exists besides \\"Outer Space.\\"  They have their daily routines of reading, exercise, and watching TV.  The TV shows life on other \\"planets.\\"  All Jack knows is Room and everything in it.  There are also objects like Bed, Table, Rug, Wardrobe, and Plant.  In Jack's eyes, there is only one of everything.  He doesn't know what he's missing out on in the real world.  He does knows, though, that a man (dubbed \\"Old Nick\\") stops by on some nights to bring them food and \\"make the bed squeak\\" while he hides in Wardrobe.<br /><br />While the story is softened a bit because it's told from Jack's point of view, it doesn't make the subject matter any more bearable.  The author, Emma Donoghue, does a great job of stepping into Jack's shoes (or feet, since Jack doesn't wear shoes in Room) and looking at the world through a precocious five-year-old's eyes and seeing it with innocence.<br /><br />Although Jack often repeated himself, as children do, the novel held my interest throughout and was very easy to read.  Two big events happen in ROOM that had me on the edge of my seat, but then I felt a little disappointed after each one because their climaxes weren't as dramatic as I was hoping.  Each situation was resolved a little too quickly.  For that reason, I'd give the novel 4 1/2 stars, but I'm rounding up to 5 since I don't have that option.  After finishing the novel, though, I can say I feel a bit sad that I won't get to read anymore about Jack and Ma.  That's the sign of a good book.on't have that option.

Again, the slow motion got old after the very beginning and it happened even more towards the end. I felt it didn't add anything and found it to only be a nuisance.<br /><br />With all that said, I really didn't like this. It should be noted that I am currently and have always been NOT a fan of the Halo series (I watched this on Netflix so I got to watch it for \\"free\\" instead of paying the rental price on Amazon. The absolute ONLY reason I even considered looking at it). I'm not sure what it is about people who write the Halo stories or design the costumes, but you could at least spend a little time thinking about things from a tactical point of view and maybe do a tiny bit of research into the military. Example being when they were running through the woods at night to escape and the one kid had a lantern. Really? And why does Mst. Chief have so many lights on him too? We have these things called NVG's and they can see with IR lights. I understand it's a movie and all, but if you're not going to try and make it believable then why even bother making it? I'm also not a fan AT ALL of this \\"I'm the only one who can save the entire universe\\" scenario. I mean seriously, he took out 3 or 4 alien \\"snipers\\" from what appeared to be a good 350m with a pistol WHILE running. Did I mention with a pistol? And while running? It just gets so obnoxious because it shows a total lack of creative thinking and involvement of the other characters while writing. \\"Hmm...how should we kill these guys?? ...well I give up! Let's just have Mst. Chief Spartan kick them from the sky and call it a day.\\"<br /><br />So that's my two cents. I still think big time Halo fans will love this so if you're a big fan of the games I definitely recommend it to you.

B00AIBZM40|2.0|If you're expecting anything even half as decent as Guillermo del Toro's previous work, skip this. It has an decent story and okay acting, but it just falls flat. Not scary at all, crappy effects, the \\"MAMA\\" character is just really weak and poorly done, and overall it's not even all that entertaining. I wasn't expecting much when I saw the trailer, and that's what I got from watching this movie, not much at all. I am a huge horror fan, anything from low budget B (or worse for that matter) to high budget movies, but this movie was a waste of time, in my opinion.

B008JFUO4U|3.0|Epic, slick, and at times a little lost, OBLIVION is a well meaning scifi flick that takes too many wrong turns telling it's tale.<br /><br />Part MATRIX, part TOTAL RECALL, director Joseph Kosinski's tale of a future earth destroyed by alien attack (aided in part by their destruction of the moon).  In the very first minute of the film we're told in a voice over that while humanity won the war (by using nukes), the planet is now a barely recognizable radioactive wasteland.  The few people left are essentially mechanics for huge water processing plants meant to help reestablish humanity on the moon Titan.<br /><br />Tom Cruise's character is plagued by strange dreams of earth before the invasion - an earth he never saw.  These dreams are apparently brought on by the mind wipe he must go through to ensure that if captured by aliens, he can reveal no vital information.  Otherwise he seems content in fixing battle robots meant to destroy the few remaining alien stragglers and having loveless sex with his outpost partner.<br /><br />So much of this film's strategy is based on a slow reveal of a great secret.  Without getting in to details, it's a form of storytelling I've been been overly fond of - the flashback.  While it basically works (there's no doubt that all's not as it should be, right from the start), I can't help but wonder what might have been if this film was told as a linear narrative.<br /><br />And that's because Cruise is never really able to emotionally attach to anything or anyone in the movie, despite a mighty effort to do so.  The story is told in such a disjointed way that one spends more time trying to figure out what the mystery is as opposed to really caring what happens to the people in the story.<br /><br />Now if the script were more witty in it's dialogue or if the music was better, perhaps this style of film making would have worked better.  But the script is as plain a white bread - absolutely bland and perfunctory.  The music is worse - while electronic band M83 (Anthony Gonzalez & Joseph Trapanese) strive for something grand & epic, it comes off a bland version of Daft Punk's TRON: LEGACY score.  That's ironic as Kosinski also directed that otherwise very bland film.  OBLIVION absolutely screams out for a classical score like John Barry might have done, or something as far out and passionate as Vangelis, but instead is as generic as you're likely to hear in a major movie.<br /><br />Put simply, there's very little heart or soul in this film.  The effects are clean, crisp, and largely excellent, and the acting - while not stellar - is certainly good enough.  As are the sets, costumes and the like.  In the end Kosinski seemed far too occupied with the twists of the road as opposed to why he's on it in the first place.  That coupled with bland lines and music really helps limit what could have been a much more thrilling film.  One other huge negative - there's really only about an hour's worth of story here (at least as Kosinski tells it), yet OBLIVION is over two hours long, and that is the kiss of death for me.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  3 \\"They blew up the moon in VAMPIRELAND too!\\" stars out of 5
B00BGIC2J2|5.0|we have watched this movie over and over.  funny movie.  a date night must!!  little bits of real life all over this movie
B008JFUNYG|3.0|Stephen King once wrote that if a horror writer knows he can't scare the reader, then they should go for the gross out.  In EVIL DEAD, essentially the 5th version of this film from producer Sam Raimi, director Fede Alvarez takes that advice to heart and foregoes any real scares and instead goes for gnarly gore drenched scenes.<br /><br />And that's not all bad.  See, we've seen this all before.  From IN THE WOODS, to the original THE EVIL DEAD and it's two direct sequels, to DRAG ME TO HELL, Raimi has gone back to story of a group of people being tormented by demons (and being possessed by them) time and time again.  When you add to those films the comic books, video games, and Japanese tribute films (RINGU prime among them), it was going to be hard to truly scare anyone with this tale.<br /><br />That being the case, Alvarez wisely just cuts to the quick.  From the very first scene EVIL DEAD lets the audience know that they will be watching a hard R gorefest roller coaster ride.  This newest version of EVIL DEAD has basically the same plot as the original, but is shot like the aforementioned DRAG ME TO HELL and moves at a lighting pace.<br /><br />This is certainly a big budget version of the slapdash original which was shot on a shoestring.  Everything from rain machines to a professional cast (lead by \\"Suburbatory\\"s Jane Levy) to lots of gruesome makeup effects, to the excellent musical score by Roque Baños, has a Hollywood polish.  The camera work is slick and the film is well lit - a very well produced film top to bottom.<br /><br />Of course, some of the original (and sequel's) charm came from Raimi pulling a movie out of a hat using not much more then a few props and a bucket of blood.  He did so in part with some of the most original use of editing tricks and sound effects ever done in a indie film.  Not a whole lot of either in this remake.  The original also had a much stronger sense of fantasy and a willingness to draw out a scene in order to get a goodscare.<br /><br />The scares in this version mostly come in the form of RINGU-esque silhouettes of victims of possession.  Creepy, but nothing as scary as the original.  Director Alvarez had a real opportunity for a particular character's story to generate real terror - she's detoxing even as she knows an even worse terror is coming - but no one will believe her.  This could have been played for all it's worth, really milking her very real reason for wanting to leave and her friends continuing to make her stay.  Instead we get a quick (albeit cool) trick with a mirror and not much more.  This version of EVIL DEAD simply does not take the time to generate any real feeling for these characters - we simply don't know them very well and they act stupidly at almost every important juncture of the story.<br /><br />EVIL DEAD is also hurt to a degree by gaffes and other \\"only in Hollywood\\" moments.  There's a nail gun that somehow works without a compressor (and has endless nails); a 30 year old chainsaw is made to work using 30 year old gas during a rain storm; the kids don't immediately leave the cabin when it's clear something has gone terribly wrong there.  Between the gaffes, the gore, and the idiot actions of the teens/twenty something cast, it's quite a bit like an 80's horror movie...<br /><br />Which of course it's a remake of.  This version of EVIL DEAD is far better then the weak remakes of THE HILLS HAVE EYES and NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, but isn't anywhere near as original (or scary) as Rob Zombie's remake of HALLOWEEN.  Still, it's great to see any Hollywood movie as brutally gory as this (there's even f bombs), and it manages to pay tribute to the original without being slavish to it.  In the end this version of DEAD acts as a gritty, fun Halloween party movie.  I'd think teenage viewers would absolutely love it (esp if they had never seen the original), and that counts for a lot in my book as teens are clearly the target audience.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  3.5 \\"If you get to a cabin that has burned up bodies and a Satanic bible you should probably leave\\" stars out of 5

0738702994|5.0|I've been using tarot cards for about 3 years and don't enjoy the artwork on the Rider Waite deck.  I've stuck with it however until recently I decided that I would rather have a deck that didn't feel and look so negative.  I'm tired of the ugly devil with horns and a tail on this deck and the hierophant that looks like a scary, old judgmental priest.  The Rider Waite illustrations may be traditional but they are depressing!  After researching many tarot decks I decided to order the Liewellyn Tarot cards from Amazon.  Since I've been using the Rider Waite and have learned most of the meanings I wanted to stay with a similar deck.  This one does follow the cards I've already memorized but what a pleasure to look at them!  They are friendly, and feel loving, not judgmental.  The quality seems very good.  They were easy to shuffle the first time, not too stiff.  I've got arthritis in my hands so this is important to me.  I would recommend this as a first deck to buy, rather than the  Rider Waite.  Any how to books should go along with this deck.  I recommend starting with Tarot Plain and Simple by Anthony Louis for the best how to book to begin with.,

B001LX2J22|3.0|Its all right I guess, but its so hard to watch this movie knowing that Manhunter exists.  This thing is way too cinematic in its aesthetic. Silence of the lambs had kind of a docu-drama, gritty realism feel to it. Red dragon feels like something pumped out of a hollywood factory.  When it comes to Hannibal Lector, less is more. Why Manhunter and Silence worked so well is because Lector wasn't the center focus. He was the icing on the cake. Red Dragon exists because solely because of the popularity of Hannibal Lector and it feels more like &#34;his&#34; movie. There's a lot of very talented actors and contributors to film, but some how they all come up short.  Harvey keitel is in full Reservoir dogs mode here and its super inappropriate.  Elfman's score is in full Nightmare before Christmas/Batman 89 mode and it feels way out of place.  Phillip seymour hoffman, an incredible actor in his own right, comes off as dazed, whiny and confused.  Edward Norton is asleep in this movie and Will Peterson blows him out of the water. Will gram is a tortured soul, a man constantly in a struggle with is own mind, as he battles to stay sane, while fighting against his ability to think as serial killers do. Will peterson portrays this beautifully. Norton looks like just some regular guy, nothing really bothering him and this makes the character so much less interesting.   Hannibal lector IS NOT in this movie. Its Anthony Hopkins trying to play a caricature of Hannibal lector and that's why this film suffers. They try so hard to re-create the magic between Clarice and lector and fail so incredibly. Almost every scene between Norton and Lector feels off, mostly because they add more than there originally was and it feels so forced. So very sadly The lector of Silence of the lambs is not in this film.  Now finally we come to Brett Ratner. I must say that, despite him being a hack, the film is competently made from a technical standpoint, but the acting is so wooden and lifeless, but that's his calling card unfortunately.  So bottom line is, go see Manhunter. It's a film that comes off as truly inspired, although highly stylized. Red Dragon on the other hand is entertaining, but flimsy and strait-forward.

0753541467|5.0|As a Personal Fitness Trainer, this book is excellent reading.  It's also great reading for anybody who is concerned about their health.  It explains, in an understandable manner, just how much the Food Industry is working against the consumer in terms of putting exces salt, sugar, and fat into almost everything we eat.  It also explains how the labels on foods are misleading and leading consumers to thinking they're buying something &#34;healthy&#34; when in fact,they're buying something that's equally unhealthy as another product e.g., you buy a &#34;low-fat&#34; yogurt and while it may be &#34;low in fat&#34;, it's still 50 percent sugar.<br /><br />If you care about your health, or if you have children you are concerned about on today's age of unhealthy foods, this is a great and helpful book.

1596912863|5.0|I loved this little novel! It was a one- night read for me, which I dove into instead of grading AP English Lit essays! When Austenland arrived today I decided to just read one chapter. Then one more. Then one more ... I read through dinner time ... I read through the evening news ... The story is really engaging and funny, real and surreal, touching yet uplifting! And, in true Austen tradition, one must have a happy ending, right? Although Shannon Hale bases her protagonist's Austen obsession on the Colin Firth BBC movie's Mr. Darcy, and I am decidedly in the Matthew MacFayden camp, it didn't matter ... At the bottom of things, Mr. Darcy is still ... Well ... Mr. Darcy, and (SPOILER!) she creates a modern, imperfect, but perfectly believable Darcy-esque hero! Hooray for this fun and funny novel, such a refreshing break from the serious lit that I teach!
