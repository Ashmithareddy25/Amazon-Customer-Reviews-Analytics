B00018D44U|5.0|Norah has really changed pace with this album, moving from her trademark Jazz-Pop mix that had critics and the public hooked. <br />As usual her voice is so unmistakeable and unique. <br />But what really grabs you is the quality of music. <br />Her vocals will hold out forever but her skill in songwriting and piano playing is amazing and well commended. <br />You really have to like this album because of its sheer beauty. <br />She draws in a few big names: Dolly Parton and Jesse Harris but thats not the thing its that she blends with them well and dosen't overpower or is outclassed. From start to finish it is perfection, it seems she can do no wrong with her albums. <br />Her singles are not commercially successfull but they could be. <br />If she went more poppier that would wreck the beauty but would sell. <br />I think America hasn't re-accepted the ballad commercially as a single yet. <br />Its still hip-hop, but Norah Jones is a getaway from mainstream.
B00005AQGH|5.0|it's funny cause after listening to all these redhead stepchildren drop album after album after album i can go back to this album from tupac and get saddened but also relieved. saddend cause ain't nobody dropping hot (...) like this now and relieved cause i have good hip hop to listen to. this is classic for a lot of reasons. this album was rushed and still sounds better than albums people work on what seems like forever.(purple haze)hell, even fifty cent said he couldn't fill tupac's shoes and fifty is one cocky dude. i'm getting a little off topic but this album only has 12 tracks but that's all it needs cause it's a great album. i don't have to skip any track. even though this album is rushed pac still put his heart and soul in it which makes it sound so good. if you are a tupac fan you need this album cause this is the music that was made in his last days.(it's almost like he knew that)if you are a hip hop fan and want a break from chingy,nelly,fifty cent,jay-z(wasn't he supposed to retire?!)and a lot of other \\"artist\\" then put this in your system and just let it ride.   r.i.p. tupac a.k.a. makaveli-the greatest rapper to ever touch the mic
B000002H70|5.0|The Cure are not my favourite band, though they surely are up there, but this is hands-down my favourite album of all time. Why? As a young adult in the post-CD age of downloading tracks, this opus struck me over the head and left me wading in melancholy, ecstasy, humility, delight. I heard this album for the first time leaving my apartment in Montreal to go to a cafe and study, grabbed the first CD of my roommate's sitting on the counter. I remember that day so clearly: I was totally hungover and foggy-headed, and it was one of those magical late-March gloomy, rainy, drizzly Montreal Saturday afternoons on rue Laurier. From about a minute into 'Plainsong' I was rapt: \\"Sometimes you make me feel like I'm living at the edge of the world/Like I'm living at the edge of the world.' I spent the rest of the day stumbling around the city in my Converse sneakers finding some hazy lucidity in my stupour, incredulous to discover that Plainsong merely introduced an hour of equally jarring material.<br />Robert Smith has said he made _Disintegration_ to express his sense of growing, well, disintegration- losing the purity of adolesence and sense of stable self which all of us can relate to. But ironically, listening to this album is the perfect Cure to such existential woes. All of a sudden, all of your breakups, gloomy depression, and unfulfilled desires are like stars in Smith's shattering-glass, reverberating, lugubrious dreamworld where people fall to their knees in prayer for rain, fall in love in deep murky waters, and dance with spidermen on candy-stripe legs. Luscious and life-changing.
B00005AWMF|5.0|If you're a product of the eighties, most likely you've never known a time without the ever prolific, soulful Sade and frankly, who would want to? The Best of Sade is a sixteen track masterpiece featuring some of her best work until 1992. Released in 1994, the album went double platinum in the United States, the United Kingdom and Italy, in addition to going platinum in nine other countries.<br /><br />With her exotic beauty and captivating voice, Sade manages to cast a spell on any listener; however, I must admit, it's &#34;never as good as the first time.&#34; Somewhere around 1995, I stumbled across an old cassette tape in my dad's study. As a teenage male, anything that featured a beautiful woman on the cover piqued my interest. I rushed to put the cassette in my stereo and the first thing I heard were the horns and bass of &#34;Is It a Crime.&#34; Then I heard one of the most beautiful voices say, &#34;This may come...this may come as some surprise, but I miss you.&#34; I missed her too, yet I didn't even know who she was.<br /><br />It was Sade's sophomore album, Promise, released ten years earlier in 1985, which quickly catapulted her to the top of my list of favorite singers. I thought to myself, &#34;Why hadn't I heard this before, or of Sade, for that matter?&#34; Perhaps, an even better question at the time would have been, &#34;Who is Sade?&#34; I wasn't even sure of how to pronounce her name, until my dad came in the room and muttered something along the lines of, &#34;Hooked on Sade, huh?&#34; That, I certainly was.<br /><br />Helen Folasade Adu was born in Ibadan, Nigeria, to an African father and an English mother. Growing up, she'd listen to some of the best soul singers of her time like Ray Charles, Nina Simone and Marvin Gaye - artists who were able to capture an emotion, such as heartache or love, and force that feeling upon all who listened; a skill Sade, herself, naturally possesses.<br /><br />The effortless &#34;Stronger than Pride&#34; fuses island beats, jazz, and R&B into a timeless classic. Her dynamic handling of &#34;Is It a Crime&#34; is what caught my attention. The soft, gentle tone at the beginning is overrun with emotion as Sade pleads for a love lost. &#34;Jezebel,&#34; with its haunting appeal and evident vulnerability in Sade's voice, forces you to listen and take notice. But, of course, you should be doing that anyway. On &#34;No Ordinary Love,&#34; Sade's voice oozes sex appeal, making it one of the best love-making songs ever. The lyrics to &#34;Cherish the Day&#34; fit perfectly into the deep, sensual musical accompaniment. &#34;Pearls,&#34; the jewel that closes this collection, is so full of emotion, I cried the first time I heard it.<br /><br />I'm not entirely sure how to classify Sade; so many influences are evident in her music. However, this is definitely a chill-out album to relax with your loved one and &#34;Cherish the Day.&#34;island beats, jazz, and R&B into a timeless classic.

B000148KK2|3.0|I love Diana Krall and have all her CDs, but this one's different. Not a disappointment, not a bomb, just different. For one thing, she sounds a lot earthier than on most of her other recordings. The half-dozen original tunes, mostly co-written with her hubby Elvis Costello (whose material I never cared for), have a definite moody feel- like Costello himself, Leonard Cohen, Joni Mitchell et al. While the title track has a thoughtful sound, this just isn't my taste- a little too precious for me. But if you liked DK's cover of Mitchell's \\"A Case Of You\\" (I didn't), you'll like these. On the other hand, the covers- all of which are new to me- are superb, especially the blues standard \\"Love Me Like A Man\\" (previously done by Bonnie Raitt), on which DK not only gives it a great bump-and- <br />grind vocal, but plays killer barrelhouse piano. Tom Waits' \\"Temptation\\" is another standout with a slinky Brazil- <br />meets-bar room touch. I also liked \\"Stop This World\\", the opening track and a Mose Allison tune; she does it as sardonically as the old Delta guy himself. Seems to me that DK isn't afraid to jump styles and genres- not unlike Costello and Mitchell- but I still love her as an interpreter of jazz/blues/ <br />torch standards, old and new.
B00006IU73|5.0|It has been too long since I was as excited by a new album as I have been with In Absentia.  This was my introduction to Porcupine Tree, and this album and the band will rank as one of the great musical discoveries in my life.  They are captivating and ready to break in the US.  Get 'em while you can.
B0002XDODU|5.0|independent from who?? from the music industry that creates the same form of music under different names. unlike the engineered music that is performed by engineered boy bands and little girl bands that infest and contaminate our minds today, Rammstein's music is real food for those hungry for melody, rhythm and deep, meaningful lyrics. not knowing German is no excuse, there are a couple of good sites that give very good translations of their songs. look for them. Hell , you may even want to try learning a little German. Rammstein's songs have strong metaphors and a real violent form of German-Expressionism. They have been making mainstream music for about a decade now, and they constantly evolve and expand their territory. The new album is different from the rest in the way the songs make their \\"expression\\". The intensity is always present but know the lyrics carry a greater portion of that intensity, which  <br />I think is a very good advancement. And as they suggest in their songs \\"LOS\\"  -\\" now they are talking\\"- In brief, I am so happy with this album. It is a very good addition to their previous albums. And I am glad that THEY DID NOT REPEAT THEMSELVES or do a variation of their previous works with the new album. There is progress here.
B00000099Y|5.0|Seriously...all these 1 Star Reviews...you gotta be kidding me. You guys think you're all \\"cool\\" by going against the flow and making fun of Tool. As one reviewer put it, \\"Tool brings nothing new to the table.\\" Umm, where have you been? Your head up your ass? Quite possibly. It's the only explanation. <br /> <br />For those who are all hating on Tool, I have one thing to say: Nobody cares. Sure, I wrote this review in response, but I could careless about what you have to say. You obviously don't know the true heart of Tool or know anything about them, and are just trying to justify your pathetic lives by ripping on such an influential band. I know that when some of you have given one star reviews to Pink Floyd (genius), that you're on Amazon simply to give out one star reviews because you have no life. Enjoy it. <br /> <br />As for me, I'll keep listening to Tool and enjoying the masterpieces these guys have made. Sure, Tool isn't God, they're a band. But they're a damn good band. And this is a damn good album. The other reviewers (the ones that gave 5 star reviews, like it deserves) have put it well, so I'll let their words be an example for you. Listen to this album, with an open mind and open ears, and you'll find something that is beyond any scope of anything you've ever heard.
B0000C23DO|4.0|This is a GOOD collection of dead songs except it doesnt have wharf rat, or any other live songs except one track. And ask any dead fan, the best dead is live dead. If you want to get a grateful dead cd get the dead at the filmore east 1971, or check out some dicks picks, but dont get this.
B0002ZDVEU|2.0|Title: The Bourne Supremacy <br />Released: 2004 <br />Rated: PG-13 <br />Running Time: 1 hour 49 minutes <br />Directed by: Paul Greengrass <br />Starring: Matt Damon as Jason Bourne <br />          Franka Potente as Marie <br />          Brian Cox as Ward Abbott <br />          Julia Stiles as Nicky <br /> <br />   After the thorough enjoyment of viewing this movie's predecessor, \\"The Bourne Identity\\" in 2002, I was looking forward to seeing the sequel, especially after I heard good things about it.  Unfortunately this film was a major let down.  The reasoning behind the failure of this movie to live up to the first movie in the series was not the acting or the storyline (which was good despite the fact that it was overly predictable), it was the poor decision of the director (Greengrass) to film much of it with handheld cameras to add a sense of anxiety.  The result is a movie that looks like it was filmed during an earthquake, and not just a tremor mind you, but a full blown catastrophic rictor scale rocking disaster.  The screen is constantly bouncing up and down and to and fro making it extremly difficult to follow the action and get caught up in the story.  With this movie I think I finaly found an action sequence style more irritating than slow motion scenes.  As a result, Greengrass has damaged an otherwise decent action film.  This causes me further concern because I have heard that he has been named as the director of the soon to be filmed follow-up, \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\".  Hopefully he will have gotten the shakes out of his system and can film a more watchable movie next time around. <br />   That said, the movie is based loosely upon the best selling novel of the same name penned by Robert Ludlum in 1986.  It follows the continuing adventures of the title character, Jason Bourne (well played by Damon), a CIA trained super assassin who is struggling to overcome a major case of amnesia which was introduced at the begining of the first film when his bullet riddled body was pulled from the ocean by a fisherman.  In this movie Bourne, who now resides in Goa, India with his love interest from the first film (Potente) is troubled by a recurring flashback of a murder of a man and woman in a hotel room that he apparently committed some time before.  His troubles are compounded by the fact that the CIA believes him to be responsible for the murder of some agents in a recent Berlin operation.  The CIA begins looking for Bourne which embarks him upon a series of events in which his imbedded training comes in handy as he turns the tables on his pursuers.  As I said this could have been a good movie had it been filmed in a more watchable manner.  As it is, I found it difficult to stay with the story as it literaly bounced around the screen.  I would recommend it only to those who enjoy the series or who are fans of Damon-but I would advise anyone watching this film to take a heavy dose of Dramamine before pressing play.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I know. You're resistant to the trendy film by the Marc Jacobs wearing daughter of a legend. Everybody probably just says they love it because everybody else says they should. I know. I have my suspicions about movies like that. I've watched people tremble and say, \\"LIT changed my life it is soooooo goood.\\" <br /> <br />Here is a level-headed opinion on why this is a good movie: This movie is about loneliness and isolation in a close-packed city of millions. You feel the character's loneliness. You feel their brief sparks of connection. You feel them clutch at opportunities for connection.  <br /> <br />And it takes skill to pull this off - this movie could have quickly gone into non-narrative snoozeville. But although she follows the climax resolution format, the framework doesn't come poking through the story like it does in so many Hollywood films. It flows like a well documented life and that's high praise. <br /> <br />Also, to see Bill Murray be such a great, mature character is a thing of beauty. Like when John Travolta came back courtesy of Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br />Movies today aren't so good. So many are made to show off a special effects technique or to make a big car chase or be a vehicle for a star. This movie has a story and everything is there to bring that story to life. To bring you to the point. And that's how it should be.
B0001NBMBC|2.0|I'm really surprised at the reviews of this record. This band was great, original and heavy as hell. Vol. 3 sounds like Stone sour, MurderDolls, and a little bit of Slipknot thrown in for good measure. By the time i get done listening it sounds like \\"contractual obligation\\" should of been the title. These guys are capable of fAST SPEEDY rhythms but it all sounds slowed down and melodic. They already have to 'mature' by the 3rd album? I say go buy the new Dillenger Escape Plan instead.
B00000DC10|5.0|I've listened to Refused since around 1996 when I met an exchange student from Sweden and he introduced me to the political genius that is the Refused.  Better in concert than on recording if you can believe it! <br /> <br />Anyway, The Shape of Punk To Come is my favorite CD and has been since its release date.  From the opener \\"Worms Of The Senses\\" to the climactic \\"Tannhauser\\"'s violinist, the CD keeps you on the edge of your seat.  The final track is an acoustic track that winds down the whole experience (you will need it) with great lyrics that predate Rage Against The Machine's political anguish.  With incredible dynamics and extremely original guitar riffs and drum beats, the CD exceeds all expectations for any hardcore band.  Stand out tracks are \\"Worms of the Senses\\", \\"New Noise\\", and \\"Refused Are F***ing Dead.\\"  If you are looking for something different that will blow you away, buy this CD.  It is their best album by far.  After you love this CD, try Songs To Fan The Flames of Discontent.  It is a great CD as well, just not as good as Shape.  I love this band, and I don't doubt that if you are a fan of music that pushes its own archetype, you will too.
B000000I02|5.0|If god forbid I could only take one album to that idyllic desert island this one without a doubt would be it.  Even after playing it hundreds, maybe thousands of times I still hear new details and revelations every time through.<br /><br />And if that isle didn't have electricity, this is still the album I would take with me in my head, because even the imperfect memory of it would make the isolation tolerable.
B00005JMAH|2.0|This movie varied from the book, and, had I not read the book, I would've been completely lost as to what was happening in the end. The actors were good, and as a story, it was good, but the differences in the plot are too much for me bear. The special affects for the werewolf simply made me roll me eyes - it looked like a cross between a rat and a man, not a wolf and a man!  <br />It is my opinion that the film makers left out crucial information that will be important to people seeing the next movies. It is a fun watch, but it's way too long (three hours) for not enough explanations.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|There is a haunting theme that runs thru all the pictures .. I haven't been able to find the title / composer .. <br /> <br />It sounds very much like a flute or something like that .. can anyone help ? <br /> <br />Thanks
B00005JM1F|5.0|This dvd is tight. It's hella funny will ferrel's ight but Andy Dick was funnier in his short scene of b.j. tutorial it was a little nasty but funny. If your looking for comedy and don't mind a little nudity and profanity along the way this is your movie.I give it 5 stars.
B0002XDODU|5.0|Finally , I have discovered a serious band that doesnt sound like cartoon characters as almost all american bands sound these days.  <br />I was sick and tired of MTV and the existing high-pitched weasel white boy bands and tough guy wannabe gangsta-rappers freaks that hop and jump around like paranoid monkeys and pretend making music. <br /> <br />These guys set the whole scene ablaze. <br /> <br />
B0001AP12G|5.0|Man, this is the best CD to hit the stores in a long time. I bought it the first day it was out, and I still listen to it. <br /> <br />We Don't Care- Awesome song. I like how his rhymes in this one. \\"the drug game bulimic it's hard to get weight, some n***** money is homo it's hard to get straight\\". 9/10 <br /> <br />All falls down- awesome song, but once radio and MTV got a hold of it, I hated it because it was so overplayed. But I still like it. Syleena Johnson does a great job on this track. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />I'll fly away- good sond, goes for a \\"gospel\\" feeling before Spaceship and Jesus walks. John legend is awesome on piano. 8/10 <br /> <br />Spaceship- i don't like kanye on this song, but GLC and Consequence make this song cool. the marvin gaye sample is perfect for this song. 10/10 <br /> <br />Jesus Walks- another contestant for most played out song of the year. But I still gotta give kanye props for this. he's not ashamed to show that he has a spiritual side, making other rappers \\"come out of the closet\\" 10/10 <br /> <br />Never let me down- the best song on the cd by far. Jay-z verses are amazing, as is kanyes. j-ivy sounds more like he's talking, but it's still effective. 20/10 <br /> <br />Get em high- im too tired to keep typing, so this is the last one. this song is almost as good as never let me down. cimmins verse has me itching for his new album. and talib kweli is flawless as usual. 19/10 <br /> <br />new workout plan- 9/10 <br /> <br />slow jamz- 8.5/10 (a little different then the twista version, but still good) <br /> <br />breathe in, breathe out- 8/10 <br /> <br />school spirit-7/10 <br /> <br />two words- 10/10 <br /> <br />through the wire- 10/10 <br /> <br />family business- 8/10 <br /> <br />last call- 7.5/10 good but the ad libs at the end (for about 8 minutes!) got annoying. <br /> <br />TOTAL SCORE: 153.5/150
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Shaun of the Dead is a real pleasure.  Quite funny throughout as we watch sleppy-eyed slacker Shaun go through a normal day of trying to get his girlfriend back, please his mom, teach his roommate responsibility and kill a bunch of zombies.  Gorey in a delightfully silly way, comically scarey and a whole lot of fun.  Definitely recommended.
B00005CCA9|4.0|I fell in love with the Rach 3 in the early 60's listening to the Byron Janis recording on Mercury.  I have listened to Van Cliburn's ponderous recording, as well as  the arthritic Horowitz recording and the master's own recordings.  The first test I have for a piano virtuoso who records this piece is the alla marcia in the first movement - is it in tempo or has it been slowed down?  Rachmaninoff, Janis, Argerich and Sgouros all take it in tempo.  The other reviews are correct, this is a dazzling performance - electrifying with virtuosic tempi.  The liner notes state this was recorded live in Berlin in 1982 - given Ms Argerich's reputation as possibly the world's finest classically trained pianist it must have been a spectacular performance live!  It certainly is spectacular on CD - however, Ms Argerich pulls her punches - she does the shortened version of the first movement cadenza.  THere are moments when I felt that she decided to be especially visrtuosic so she races furiouisly through a passsage Cossack-like only to slow down like the Volga - it was jarring given other perrormers more lyrical approach.   All three movements are performed in roughly 40 minutes.  Since this was recorded in Berlin and the Sgouros recording was with the BPO, I can imagine a 13 y/o Dimitri Sgouros sitting in the audience being inspired by Ms Argerich's performance - he did after all record it two years later when he was 15 and he took the longer first movement cadenza!  The Sgourous recording is also about 40 minutes long.  But to accomodate the the longer cadenza the tempi are necessarily faster.  Maybe Sgouros hasn't lived up to the promise of this Rach 3 recording - but his performance is the best out there (if you can find it) - if you can't this is a reasonable second choice.
B00005JN7O|1.0|I quite honestly have not seen a movie this bad since battle field earth! The story is weak and the characters are tremendously one sided. I was under the impression that Angelina Jolie would have a large part in this film, unfortunatly I and most others were let down by her ten minutes of screen time! visualy speaking, sky captain is not as amazing as it has been said to be, after about a half an hour the \\"vintage\\" filter that this was shot in becomes less of a novelty and more of a petty annoyance. the cgi is decent but by no means breathtaking or ground breaking. Not even the addition of A list actors could save this pitiful attempt, there is absolutly no chemistry between the the two lead characters. This movie had sooooo much potential and all it needed was better direction! I did'nt expect an oscar worthy movie, i did however expect a fun and entertaining movie, I had much more fun counting the people leaving the theater!
B000002KAT|5.0|This album is mystical and beautiful, a true work of art. I thought tracks like Wild Night and Tupelo Honey were great, and they are, but Astral Weeks is so simple and relaxing, its a pleasure just to kick back and listen.  The title track, Madame George, and Slim Slow Slider are my favorites. Astral Weeks totally changed my mind about Van Morrison, he's awesome.
B00005JN0T|2.0|I skipped I ROBOT in the theaters but I had a feeling it would be good enough to buy on dvd and worth the short wait.  Well I waited for nothing because there are very little special features and i have enough bare bones dvd's such as the paramount made friday the 13th films.  I decided to just download I robot off of bit torrent and found it to be a good movie that deserved the two disk package like spiderman 2 and collateral got.  Being a huge will smith fan, i feel really let down that the film company schemes to release multiple editions of the dvd.  stop being greedy!
0553288105|4.0|Anything by Asimov is worth reading. The man was one of the great geniuses of our time. If only his writing style was a bit more sophisticated, his works might have a wider audience outside of the sci-fi arena.  <br /> <br />  This book, \\"The Gods Themselves,\\" is one of his most original and interesting. Like almost anything the man has done, it's been influential to a degree that reading it now one can't help but recall a plethora of sci-fi books that have recycled some of these ideas. What's fascinating beyond that are the ideas that haven't been pilfered before. The book is divided into three sections, each trisecting the line \\"Against ignorance, the gods themselves contend in vain\\" from Schiller. The first section is a telling portrait of how scientific progress is often motivated by irrational male posturing. The last third posits hope for the future. However, it is the middle section - Asimov's rare depiction of a truly alien species - that is the best.  <br /> <br /> If you like more ideas than verbal mastery or just following the Master on one of his flights of fancy, you'll enjoy \\"The Gods Themselves.\\" This is one of his best. <br />
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This definitely isn't metal but who cares when music here is that good. <br /> <br />I run into this CD accidentally at a listening station (metal/punk section) at local HMV store. As soon as I heard first 2 songs on this album I was hooked. I bought the CD and the same day downloaded everything I could find from this band. I know I should be supporting performers, but this stuff is hard to find in Canadian music stores (other than this CD). <br /> <br />I quickly figured that contrary to the member's looks, gothic CD cover, and lyrics, musically this band can't be classified as a metal band. There are only 2.5 short guitar solos on this album, a few songs dig a little more into a heavier music world, but that is not enough to call them a metal band. However I was impressed with the way they mixed elements of classical, hard rock, and heavy metal musical genres together and made their own musical combination that works so naturally well. The best example is \\"Ghost Love Score\\" - an unbelievable song that has it all.  <br /> <br />I laughed when I read one of the reviewers comparing bass player - supporting singer - to a singer from pop band Aqua as he is so right - especially chorus part in the song \\"Wish I had an angel\\". I don't like his voice much either, however he doesn't sing often so he doesn't really bother me. Actually his voice fits atmosphere in the track \\"Siren\\" very well. My only complaint is that there isn't enough guitar solos in Nightwish's songs - it would definitely lift the power of their music a bit - but probably also make them sound less commercial as well. <br /> <br />So my advice is, if you want heavy metal stuff, don't buy this CD. However, if you enjoy classical music and like some of the heavier music as well (like me) or want to discover something new and different - you will love this CD.  All I can say is that last 5-6 days, Nightwish is all I am listening to. <br /> <br />

0062502182|4.0|The Alchemist is a simple story, telling the simple and most basic truths of life. These, as most people have found in there life, tend to hold the most truth. It is a great philosophical book that teaches of destiny and following your life head on and most importantly not fearing uncertainty. I think the people who gave this book a bad rating because \\"it had poor plot development\\" or it was too \\"simple\\" obviously missed something. The purpose of the book isn't to be some wordy novel using ten dollar words to \\"seem\\" intelligent. Instead it tells its story by breaking up the main characters journey into smaller stories that teach us about the simple truths in life. The beauty of this book is that it can have a huge impact on a wide spectrum of ages. Im writing this to mainly combat the bad rating that people gave this because they were obviously oblivious to the purpose of the book. It would be best compared to reading the Tao Te Ching or any book on Eastern religion for the most part.

B000002JSJ|5.0|Presence (1976.), Led Zeppelin's seventh studio album<br /><br />When people consider Led Zeppelin's great albums, the list more than often contains Led Zeppelin I, II and IV or Physical Graffiti. Presence, the 1976 offering from the band rarely gets a mention alongside these classics. Hastily recorded in the aftermath of the huge success of the double album, Physical Graffiti, Presence has become one of the band's more criticised and sometimes forgotten works. However, is this a fairly passed judgment on Led Zeppelin's Presence?<br /><br />In my opinion, this is easily Led Zeppelin's most unfairly attacked album and it deserves far more praise than it has been given. It never ceases to amaze me why this album is given such a bad press by most people; they describe 'Presence' as the album were Led Zeppelin lost their touch or they just brandish it as incoherant rubbish. All I can gather from this is that these people haven't listened to the work enough or are just one of the old 'so called' Led Zeppelin fans. 'Presence' is a great hard rock record, displaying some of the band's best jams. It is unique in the respect that it features no keyboard or effects; all the sound you hear is vocal, bass, guitar and drums. However, I think this is no bad thing at all. The fact that the band took a calculated step back after Physical Graffiti and tried something not too overambitous is where Presence really succeeds. The song styles are simpler in many respects but at the same time they are driven by very powerful performances from the band members. Afterall, this is Jimmy Page's favourite Led Zeppelin record and you can clearly see why he enjoys this one; his guitar playing is dynamic and inspired throughout. Furthermore, this album features some killer tracks. 'Achilles Last Stand', perhaps the band's greatest epic, features on this album, as does the fan favourite 'Nobody's Fault But Mine'. The album may have been rushed together, recorded in limited time in Germany but to be honest, the music is first rate and deserves five stars all the way. Even more remarkable is Plant's vocal performance on the album; at the time of recording, he was recovering from a car accident and had to actually sing some parts laid down. His vocals are as compelling as ever though.<br /><br />Led Zeppelin kick off their hard-rocking seventh album with one of their finest tracks. 'Achilles Last Stand' stands as one of the bands most powerful epics. In fact, this 10 minute track alone is worth the price of admission, led by its unwavering groove, a particularly haunting Plant vocal, and several show stopping give and take segments between Page and Bonham. During these thrilling exchanges, Bonham's volcanic drum fills interlock with Page's wailing guitar parts, seizing several moments of tension that build to the bursting point. This awesome opening track is followed by 'For Your Life'. This is classic Zeppelin, and for me another one of their best songs. I can never tire of this song; the strutting riffs from Page's guitar make this song memorable. Plant gives a vintage performance on the vocals, sounding out lyrics about drug taking. Next up though is perhaps the weakest song on the album; still 'Royal Orleans' ain't that bad a song. Plant gives a lyrical take on one night stands, a classic rock n' roll song theme however the melodic backing of the track and the riffs are a bit repetitive. However, at 3 minutes, this weaker track hardly detracts from the albums overall rating.<br /><br />Then we come to the second half of the album. Robert Plant, whose voice has grown rougher over the years, gives a compelling, stuttered vocal performance on 'Nobody's Fault But Mine', an excellent, hard rocking song. This one is a fan favourite. The song also makes a welcome return of the harmonica to Led Zeppelin's music. 'Candy Store Rock' follows, with some catchy guitar play from Page that has a very 1950's rock n' roll sound to it. 'Hots On For Nowhere' follows and keepsthe blood pumping on the album. Many have passed this song off as filler however, I think it's a great song. It's upbeat, has masterful stop-start riffs and some great harmonisation sections, with a 'la, la, la' chorus with funky backbeats. To finish the album is a welcome return to the blues by Led Zeppelin. 'Tea For One' is in a similar vein to 'Since I've Bin Loving You' from LZ III. A little long and drawn out, nevertheless, Plant gives a resounding vocal performance and Page's guitar virtuousity shines through.<br /><br />All in all, 'Presence' measures up to be a damned good album. True, this album isn't revolutionary, it isn't experimental but the sheer quality of the hard rock songs on the album makes the work a winner. As a seasoned Led Zeppelin fan, 'Presence' has over time become one of the band's works that I listen to more; I would even on some days, place this album in the league of some of the band's earlier work. 'Presence' is a sadly underrated classic album from the great band and many seem to ignore it. My advice is to not start a Led Zeppelin collection with this album, but certainly to obtain it once you really start getting into the band's music. This is Led Zeppelin's last classic album and it deserves some RESPECT!Many have passed this song off as filler however, I think it's a great song.

B000669GAI|5.0|Please diregard the post by AZ. This person even though entitled to his/her/it's own opinion states that Pearl Jam sucks. Not that rearview mirror is a good/bad album, but that Pearl Jam sucks. Thank you az, thank you very much for your wisdom. Anyway Rearview Mirror is a great b-side collection, my only gripe is that it didn't have Long Road. Anyway, pick it up and hear some of the best b-sides ever.
B000669GAI|1.0|When will the world learn?  Grunge sucks.  Who wants to listen to a bunch of flannel clad middle aged men whine about all their Generation X teenage angst?  Why is this idiotic band putting out a Greatest Hits CD?  Don't they realize that their time came and went a LONG time ago?  Grunge died for a reason.  Lets keep it dead and in the early 90s where it belongs.  There's no place for alternative rock in the 21st century.
B00064MW6A|2.0|Okay, his movie was definitely a \\"chick flick\\", and there were many lame one liners, as well as times where they went too over the top with the whole cat thing (What a purrrfect idea).  However, there were some scenes that pulled the movie through. <br /> <br />Halle Berry gave the best performance that she could, given the script she had to work with.  I admire the fact that she had to train very hard for this role too.  Being a whip-cracking practitioner myself for the past year, I can say that it is much harder than it looks.  Halle Berry did an EXCELLENT job with the whip in this movie (although the whip was definitely CG in the final scene).   <br />Halle also had to train in a Brazilian martial art called Capoeira, which is very physically demanding as it requires you to be constantly moving, cartwheeling around and throwing kicks from unusual positons. She pulled it off pretty well for somebody at her level.  I'm actually going to start learning this fascinating martial art myself very soon. <br /> <br />Sharon Stone did alright as Laurel Hedare, sexy and manipulative, but as a villain in a comic book story, she seemed quite lame.  I think she is a good actress (Casino), but NOT for a movie like Catwoman. <br /> <br />The love story between the evolving Patience Phillips and Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt) got annoying most of the time, but I guess it was supposed to be a catylist for Patience's evolution into Catwoman. <br /> <br />I don't know who played Patience Phillips friend Sally, but the moments with her in the film (while quite funny) were the scenes that gave the movie it's \\"chick flick\\" status. <br /> <br />Lambert Wilson as Mr. Hedare = Boring <br /> <br />So in the end, I guess the thing I truly admire about this film was the amount of hard work that Halle Berry had to put into this role.  I definitely think she has the \\"stuff\\" (for lack of a better word) to portray the complexity of this character, but she did not have much to work with here.  If theyDO make a sequel, they need to cut back a lot on those lame one liners, not go too over the top with the cat thing, and most importantly they need to get some interesting villains and a good story. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00005JKG7|5.0|Antonio Bay is a small town by the sea, with a deadly past.  The town's Founding Fathers, in an effort to gain money to build their new town, caused the wreck of a ship carrying gold.  They thought they could put the past behind them.  They were wrong.<br /><br />A fog is slowly creeping into town.  With it come menacing figures...the ghosts of the dead sailors.  They want their revenge.  Six sacrifices, and the return of their gold.  And if they do not get this...then there will be hell to pay in Antonio Bay.  And not even God will be able to help them.<br /><br />Staring Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh (the two, by the way, do NOT play mother-daughter characters), Nick Castle, and Hal Holbrook as a brooding and creepy Father Malone, \\"The Fog\\" is one of those great horror movies that doesn't involve much violence or gore (though there are indeed some shocking scenes); what's frightening is what you don't see, and what you are afraid of.  With great casting and directing by John Carpenter, this is a horror film fans of the genre cannot afford to miss.
B00005V1B2|5.0|The Snow Goose is one of the greatest achievements of 70s progressive rock.  The members of Camel are very tasteful on their instruments; they aren't flashy but a few well-placed notes can go a long way.  Andrew Latimer and the late Peter Bardens make use of great guitar and keyboard sounds respectively.<br /><br />Much of Camel's music has a feeling of warmth and sincerity.  Throughout this album the band creates some almost soul-crushingly beautiful music.  There are no lyrics, but the suite works perfectly without them.  The music ranges from mysterious and haunting to reflective to whimsical to somber to joyful with a nice ebb and flow.  There is less of the edgier rocking material on here than was present on their earlier albums, except for the second half of \\"Dunkirk.\\"  At times I wonder if this album had an influence on classic RPG video game music, especially the peaceful \\"Fritha.\\"  The grand finale (well, almost the finale) of the album, \\"La Princesse Perdue,\\" is one of the most beautiful pieces of music I've ever heard.<br /><br />The Snow Goose is a unique and accessible album that offers a relaxing change of pace for when you get tired of the crazy instrumental passages and \\"excesses\\" of most other classic prog rock.

B00005JMXX|2.0|I have beendying to see this film since it came out in the cinema, i never actually sawit in the pictures just in case i couldn't stand it therefore would have to sit through it all. Anyway, i enjoy watching disaster films as they are made brilliantly and it makes you see what happens in real life, and of course there's a lot going on in them like dante's peak. I expected the same in this, it is nothing like i thought it was going to be though now i have had it. I suppose i will get a little bit used to it. Some of the actions in the film are great but others by looking at them you can tell they are computer imaged. Basically it's about tornadoes, a massive tsunmi sort of thing and there's a lot goin on but i didn't particuarlly like the acting in it or anything. Buy i would highly recommend it for the aduts.
B00020HEL6|4.0|This little gal gives me hope in a Brittany Spears world...what a talent! I only pray she has a good manager and the wherewithal to stick with it because she has the ability to mature into a truly great vocalist. My favorite pieces on the album are the simple ones, without the overproduced and overwhelming orchestra. Summertime, which starts out wonderfully left me, at the end, wishing it had stayed simple. That's just a matter of personal taste but I would love to see her make an album accompanied by just a guitar, a la Tuck & Patti. This girl has a real future!
B0002RNXNM|4.0|Kasabian is looking to revive that magical period of British music that desperately needs to come back:  the Madchester sound.  Synthesizing elements of the Stone Roses, the Happy Mondays, and Primal scream, Kasabian truly succeed at doing what bands like the Strokes and Hot Hot Heat have done:  taking an aesthetic and applying it to the present day.  The singles from this album - 'Club Foot', 'Processed Beats', 'LSF' - are golden but it doesn't end there.  The album cuts - 'Reason is Treason' and 'Cutt Off' especially, make you want to get down and shake what your mama gave ya.
B000148KK2|4.0|I have to admit that I was never a fan of jazz but I had heard so much about Diana Krall and \\"The Girl in the Other Room\\" that I decided to buy it.  I was blown away.  Her songs are romantic and sensual.  I've had the CD for 2 days and I think I've listened to it at least 6 times.  Now I can't wait to get her other CDs. <br /> <br />June
B000003TA4|4.0|The only tracks that lack power and punch on this album are \\"Drain You\\" and \\"Lithium\\". Lithium: Yeah, yeah yeahhhhhh!!! <br /> <br />Not a desirable repeated listen. <br /> <br />Apart from that its an album that contains some of the most amazing songs and tunes ever to be written on a guitar. <br />
0385486804|3.0|This book was okay.  It wasn't my favorite, but it was good.  It has stories of other people who did the samething, and I was bored with their stories after the first few pages.  Other than that Chris's life story after college was very interesting and there were parts I couldn't put the book down.
B0002OERI0|5.0|First of all I would like to point out that i have NEVER been a big fan of Green Day. That is until i bought this political rock opera record. Putting the disc in, I expected little from the California threesome, but i should have expected more. With the story telling of a decisive poet, Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt, and Tre Cool have made one of the best musical operas of our time by combining smart, clever lyrics, Cranky guitars, pounding bass, solid drumming, and snotty vocals in a way that no other band has, or ever will, recreate. The disc starts out alright with the first single \\"American Idiot\\", about a boy refusing to be a stereotyped, wide eyed youth who belives anything he is told, and progresses into one of the best songs of the album \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" a hypnotic blend of bible belt, ritalin bashing lyrics and slamming guitars. Then trancends \\"Holiday\\" which can be described as a hard lyrical base of hatred for all, from that point on \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" trancends and leaves few breath in your lungs by the harmonized vocals and booming bass. \\"Are We The Waiting\\" is a slower heavier songs that brings the issue of self doubt. \\"St. Jimmy\\" is a song that represents the earlier \\"Dookie\\" sound of Green Day but still is an excellent track filled with ritalin induced energy. \\"Give Me Novacaine\\" is probably one of the weakest tracks on the album but is still an alright song. \\"She's A Rebel\\" is a rock solid speed punk song with extremeley well crafted drumming and startiling vocals, after which comes \\"Extraordinary Girl\\" another somewhat weak song, but has its points in that the vocals are very well harmonized and clear as crystal. \\"Letterbomb\\" is another ritalin induced speed punk song that makes you wanna kick the crap out of your cat. \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is an amazingly beautiful track that, unlike most of the songs on American Idiot, has a lighter melody and a softer tone. \\"Homecoming\\" is another well crafted song that is as long as hell, but is still worth listening to a couple of times. Finally comes \\"Whatsername\\" a final ode to St. Jimmy and the Jesus Of Suburbia with a snot punk speed that a bullet couldnt trancend. This is an album not to miss by far, so get off of your couch and go to the record store(or download it illegally)and buy(or download) this record, you'll be very glad you did.hell, but is still worth listening to a couple of times.

B0002X314C|5.0|While Kanye West was comin' up with \\"College Dropout\\", John Legend was featured throughout the CD and he was also on other Kanye West produced collaborations such as \\"This Way\\" which featured Dilated Peoples & Kanye and \\"Selfish\\" which featured Slum Village & Kanye.   Since John Legend was always singing parts in the songs and choruses on others, I wasn't sure what his actual style would be once he came out with his own CD.  When Usher & Kanye West came to Baltimore, I saw them live in concert and John Legend came out and played a piano intro to \\"Jesus Walks\\" and then he started singing \\"I'll Fly Away\\", an interlude from \\"College Dropout\\".   From then on, I figured that John Legend would be a Neo Soul artist. <br /> <br />I finally heard \\"Used To Love Me\\" and then I knew that what I thought was confirmed as Kanye had hooked John Legend up with a nice beat and John Legend definitely had a Neo Soul sound to his singing style.  My roomate received a John Legend sampler while he was up at Howard University and the sampler featured \\"Ordinary People\\".   After listening to that song many times, I knew that I would pick up John Legend's CD once the CD was released.  \\"Get Lifted\\" was originally supposed to come out in October but the CD didn't actually come out until December 28th. <br /> <br />\\"Get Lifted\\" gets off to a nice start.   After the John Legend piano intro, Kanye West blesses John Legend with \\"Let's Get Lifted\\".   To anyone who thought that \\"Used To Love Me\\" would be the only hit on his debut CD, they will definitely be silenced after hearing \\"Let's Get Lifted\\".  Although, many artists have traveled the Neo Soul path, the music behind your vocals is important.   \\"Let's Get Lifted\\" is simply an introduction to let you know that John Legend is going to be around for awhile.  \\"Alright\\" is produced by Kanye and John Legend and the song is basically talking about a woman that is approaching John and he states regardless of your situation if you want something to go down that is \\"Alright\\" with him, especially since he likes what he sees and him being tipsy isn't helping the sitaution either.  \\"Number One\\" features Kanye and the song is talking about that although he may have been foul in the past, John is still trying to make this woman his #1.  Kanye uses a Curtis Mayfield sample and \\"Number One\\" ends up being a pretty good track.   John Legend then takes a trip to \\"church\\" with Snoop Dogg talk about how they can change for a particular woman on \\"I Can Change\\".   Once Snoop finishes his rap, if you close your eyes you may actually think that you're in a church.  \\"Ordinary People\\" sounds as if this will be the next single.  John Legend simply plays the piano a la Alicia Keys and just speaks from his heart.  There is nothing wrong with that because although some people may think the song is real simple.   If the song makes sense and you can relate to what John is saying then everything is cool.  \\"Stay With You\\" sounds like something that could have been made in the 70s.  The track has an old school feel to it and the track ends up being one of my favorites on \\"Get Lifted\\". <br />However, my favorite track on this CD has to be \\"So High\\".  Sometimes, you just hear a song that gives you \\"butterflies\\" because the song is well written and put together real well.   Whether you like John Legend or not, \\"So High\\" is worth the price of the CD, trust me.  John Legend is assisted by his family on the inspirational \\"It Don't Have To Change\\".  You can tell why John has so much talent, because every family member that joins John on the track has talented vocals.  \\"Get Lifted\\" finishes off just right with the feel good track, \\"Live It Up\\" w/Miri Ben-Ari.   Intsead of following the trend by talking about everything that is negative in the world, John Legend tries to uplift us with some positivity. <br /> <br />With \\"Get Lifted\\", John Legend proves to us that although Neo Soul route has been traveled before, if you have talent and the right peoplebehind you then you can succeed.   \\"Get Lifted\\" is a very well rounded CD and if you are a fan of Neo Soul music or r&b music in general then this CD is a must buy for you.   Thank John Legend for a job well done with \\"Get Lifted\\". <br /> <br />1) So High <br />2) Ordinary People <br />3) Used To Love U <br />4) Let's Get Lifted <br />5) Stay With You <br /> <br />
B0002EXH5E|3.0|This remaster isn't as good as it could be. It sounds choppy in some places most notably on the track \\"Insomnia\\" Dave should've spent more time on this one like he did on the others.
B00012QKSI|4.0|I love this soundtrack, except for a few points: this CD's version of \\"Jump (for my love)\\" is nowhere near as good as the one on the US version, sung by the Pointer Sisters, which is played as Hugh Grant does his little dance. Also, I wish this CD had The Calling's \\"Wherever You Will Go,\\" which is also on the US soundtrack. But otherwise, I think this CD is wonderful, and if what you're after are Craig Armstrong's beautiful compositions, then this is the CD to buy.

B0002IVN9W|5.0|Many years ago, tragedy befell a small Canadian town when an arcade went up in flames, claiming the lives of dozens of children. \\"But not all of them died,\\" says Win Butler, vocalist of Arcade Fire. \\"We got out.\\"<br /><br />  According to Butler this tale describes the origins of the Arcade Fire, his seven-person, Montreal-based cabaret-rock band. The story, of course, is a fake. But its precisely the kind of quirky narrative typical of the group's strikingly emotional debut, Funeral, a Brechtian circus of twinkling piano, mournful violins, and gasping, dramatic vocals, titled as a response to the actual deaths of four of the band members' close relatives.<br /><br />  The album itself is astonishingly beautiful in every way, from the emotionally stunning tales such as \\"Neighborhood #2 (Lakia)\\", to the starch harmonical dabbers of \\"In the Back Seat\\", to the hauningly painfull \\"Wake Up\\". The Arcade Fire just might be the next Cure, but we'll just have to wait and listen before any of us can prove that...
B000003TAB|4.0|this is pretty good, saying that its all demos, and b sides. some of the songs on here are not nirvanas, they are cover songs by other bands. This is definetly not what you should buy by nirvana if your just getting to know them, start off with nevermind, bleach, or in utero. Rayn, i dont know when buzz osbourne ever said that, but he could of, but it would be stupid of him to say that. why is it stupid? because he helped kurt cobain and even introduced kurt to dave grohl, forming nirvana after they kicked out chad channing. offspring sucks, its pretty sad you compared them to nirvana. i had to laugh at that one, anyways, get this if you like nirvana a lot, not if you trying to get to know them.
B0002SROT0|4.0|while not his best album by any means, one must remember that elliott was not present to consent to the final cut of this album.  \\"from a basement on the hill\\" was originally intended to be a double album, so its anybody's guess what tracks elliott would've wanted to appear on this album. <br /> <br />that being said, this album is rather amazing, much like anything else elliott has done.  the album is sonically diverse, yet retains the trademark elliott smith features:  beautiful melodies sprinkled with emotional lyrics raw enough to bring tears to the eyes of even the coldest, cynical bastard.  this album is a fitting end to elliott smith's legacy.  a fond farewell to a friend indeed...elliott smith's music gave a voice to a plethora of feelings many of us are too afraid to mention, much less expose to the public, and for that we are forever grateful.  thank you elliott, for having the strength to bear the sorrows we could not.  you will be missed.
0385510454|4.0|Joel Backman is a powerful lobbyist and deal-maker in Washington.  Things are going his way until he gets in over his head and tries to sell a computer program that can control the satellites put up by other countries.  He's not too fussy about his clients and he gets in trouble by playing one country against another.  He goes to jail which serves as protection for him against his enemies.  When a badly defeated president is about to leave office, he is persuaded to grant Backman a pardon so that the U.S. can observe who tries to kill him and thus answer some questions about the satellite deal.  Backman is whisked away to Italy where the plans are to shield him from his enemies temporarily and then turn him loose so that they can observe him and his stalkers.  Rather than be a sitting duck, Backman decides to elude his \\"keepers\\" and strike out on his own.  This book has an interesting setting and a lot of intrigue woven into a fast-moving plot.  This is an enjoyable read, but I had a hard time with the main character who is portrayed as a contrite man when he is in Italy, but who reverts to being an arrogant person when he returns to Washington.  Having been described in villifying terms at the beginning of the book, Backman does a lot of personality flip-flopping before the end of the book.
0596007124|5.0|\\"Head First Design Patterns\\", from O'Reilly, is a true joy to read, which is saying an awful lot for a tech book.  Eric & Elisabeth Freeman have succeeded in taking a potentially mind-numbing technical stuff and presenting it in a way that is entertaining and fun.  In the end, I was amazed at how much I had retained, thanks to their use of funny photos, conversational writing style, and real-world examples.  Anyone who has read a techie book knows that a lot of them are either so far above our heads that it takes a while to \\"sink in\\" or are about as entertaining as a poorly-translated VCR manual.  After completing a chapter and doing the exercises, I actually looked forward to the next chapter!   <br /> <br />The book is about applying design patterns to Java code.  It doesn't go into all of the \\"Gang Of Four\\" patterns, concentrating only on the ones you will use the most.  My favorite was the Strategy pattern example and its \\"Sim-u-Duck\\" example.  It was a really funny way of setting the stage, illustrating inheritence, encapsulation, and the use of the pattern.  These folks are truly brilliant!  While I'm not a Java developer, I found that the content was very usable in my C# coding.  I've reserved a spot for this book in my desktop library at work; I've already used the knowledge I've gained from this book in refactoring some of my legacy applications. <br /> <br />Read this book and you will write better code.  If nothing else, you will have a blast reading the book!  well done!!!

Even if he's actually not intending to use this book as a presidential campaign launching pad, I can't help but admire a person who has accomplished so much---and still wants to accomplish much more. Resting on their own laurels would have been very easy for a person with his credentials, but he chose hard work.<br /><br />This book will make you believe: Obama for President.
B0006399FS|1.0|es posible demantelar a U2?...U2 haba sido una de las bandas ms influyentes y vigentes de la msica, gracias a su constante renovacin, bsqueda e innovacin, con trabajos sorprendentes e inspiradores. Sin embargo, al igual que lo que sucede en el ciclo de la vida, alcanzaron su mxima creatividad artstica (1991-1997) y luego descendieron, pero lamentablemente lo hicieron a una velocidad demasiado rpida. Prueba de ello son sus dos ltimos lbumes, que denotan una pobreza artstica abismante, al igual que una comercialidad absurda y barata, ya que expone al producto de una manera, cuando en realidad su valor es slo la nfima parte.  <br /> <br />Se tiende a hablar en estos das de U2 con palabras fciles y oportunistas como \\"Volver a sus races\\", pero la verdad es que U2 nunca se haban alejado tanto de sus races. U2 siempre haban matenido alguna forma de rebelda, ya sea con su actitud, sus letras, conciertos, exploracin y ambicin vanguardista, etc. Pero ahora en el ao 2000 nos encontramos con U2 opacado al mximo creativamente, vendido al sistema, preocupado tn slo de vender...pero vender qu? imagen, nombre, glamour, videos fciles, lentes oscuros, actitud Rock Star, ego, etc. Sumado a todo ello hay que agregar su descarado amor hacia Estados Unidos, ganndose el repudio de millones de fans alrededor del mundo. <br /> <br />How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb es un producto lamentable, exageradamente publicitado, carente de todo arte e imaginacin. Son slo 11 canciones fciles y pasajeras -adems de montonas y aburridas- , hechas para vender productos asociados como iPod y todo aquello. La msica es ordinaria, bsica, predecible y desechable. Las letras nos presentan una temtica clich, sobrexpuesta hasta el cansancio. La voz de Bono raya en lo absurdo e infantil cuando grita y grita tratando de demostrar que an posee un buen registro. A aos luz de Unforgettable Fire, ahora se le oye completamente ronco, spero, forzado, sucio y desgastado. Para peor el conformismo se instala de manera asquerosa cuando dice \\"I like the sound of my own voice\\". La produccin carece de toda originalidad y deseo artstico. Arreglos de cuerdas vulgares, teclados atmosfricos fciles y otros elementos tan propios de All That You Can't Leave Behind. En suma, este producto es algo que quisiramos que nunca hubiese sido vendido bajo el nombre de \\"U2\\". <br /> <br />Por ltimo, la portada del disco nos advierte todo: un U2 cmodamente sentado, sonriendo cnicamente, vestido con ropas y lentes de Rock Star, esperando por dinero fcil una vez ms. Un U2 sin color, sin vida, vendido. Tal como es este disco. <br /> <br />U2 se desmantelaron a s mismos. No hay peor ciego que el que no quiere ver.
B00004S6GL|5.0|this has got to be the most underrated album elliott ever released, yet it remains my favorite.  the production is nearly flawless, allowing for great sound quality while still leaving elliott's soft voice and understated lyrics to be the main focus of the listening experience.  some of my favorites on this album are \\"happiness,\\" \\"i better be quiet now,\\" \\"somebody i used to know,\\" \\"stupidity tries,\\" and \\"everything reminds me of her.\\"  although these are just personal favorites, i can honestly say that there isn't a single bad song on this album.  elliott smith is one of the few artists who has consistently made albums worth spending money on.  if you don't own figure 8 yet, your CD collection is painfully lacking.
6305095566|2.0|Sam Raimi knows how to make a good movie. If he had wanted to, he could have turned Evil Dead into a great horror movie. The opening scene is promising: a lonely car on a desolate road on its way to a cabin in the woods. Had Raimi only showed the same love towards the genre and the characters as he did in the Spiderman films... But, of course, he didn't. No love, only talant. <br /> <br />There is a scene that shows the attitude of the film maker, where one of the character screams: \\"Why are you torturing me like this?\\" Obviously, that's a relavant question in many horror movies. That is if you're watching the movie, not if you're in it. The perspective in this film is rather distanced. Raimi is sitting in his horror movie sofa, laughing at the mysteries of the genre. When you're facing irrational evil, you don't ask \\"why?\\". There is only one thing to do. Just run, man. Just run.
6305144176|5.0|\\"Hello Vietnam,and greetings!\\",says Bruno Kirby as Lt. Steven Hauk in one scene of this film. It was this scene where he filled in for radio personality Adrian Cronauer(Robin Williams) who was on reportedly on special assignment. Adrian arrives in Vietnam from America via aircraft. At first the military brass was delighted to have him grace the Vietnam radio airwaves. But they discover that Adrian's brand of humor is outrageous,very much like Howard Stern in real life. They also disagree with the rock 'n roll music he is playing. Hey,this was(set in) 1965 and rock 'n roll was dominating the music world especially with The Beatles and The Rolling Stones from the United Kingdom. When Adrian and Lt. Hauk first met,the lieutenant told Adrian that he was sort of a comedian himself. When the lieutenant first heard Adrian on the air,the lieutenant was not pleased at all with Adrian's stint. \\"You oughta stick to playing 'normal modes of music',not wild stuff\\",Lt. Hauk told Adrian in a meeting. The 'normal modes of music' refer to easy listening artists like Andy Williams,Perry Como,Mantovani,Jim Nabors,Lawrence Welk,Frank Sinatra and Percy Faith. \\"Would Bob Dylan be out of line?\\",Adrian asks Lt. Hauk and the lieutenant replies,\\"Way,way,way out of line!\\". Adrian becomes popular with the fighting men in Vietnam and they hoped that Adrian would permanently do his morning show there. The brass decides to suspend Adrian,bringing heartbreak to fans. When Lt. Hauk did his stint,many listeners wrote and telephoned about how they wanted Adrian back on the air. One listener said in a letter,\\"Captain Hauk sucks the sweat off a dead man's balls.\\" Another wrote to Lt. Hauk,\\"You suck,eat a bag of s--t!\\". So Adrian is back on the air but not for long because Sgt. Dickerson(the late J.T. Walsh),the top man of the brass,demanded that Adrian be cancelled. Sgt. Dickerson's superior loves Adrian and even demanded his reinstatement. Sgt. Dickerson is transferred to Guam since his superior grewtired of the seargeant's abusive attitude. The title of this film is how Adrian began his morning show. On the very last show done by Adrian's friend Lt. Ed Garlick(Forrest Whittaker),Ed began the show saying,\\"Good morning,Vietnam\\",just like Adrian. Ed tells listeners about Adrian's departure from Vietnam. We hear Adrian saying,\\"Goodbye,Vietnam\\" in a pre-recorded message. Adrian also left Vietnam because of his association with a criminal who's the brother of a Vietnamese woman Adrian befriended. Other funny scenes include Adrian teaching the Vietnamese how to use profanity,Adrian doing a parody of the late Richard M. Nixon on the air and Adrian doing a live performance for a group of fighting soldiers while they were in a parked truck enroute to a battlefield. This film was a megahit for both Williams and director Barry Levinson. They were both at least nominated for Academy Awards. Levinson did win a Best Director Oscar for his next film,RAIN MAN. This film was released theatrically in late 1987 just like THREE MEN AND A BABY. Both films were made by Touchstone Pictures,a division of Buena Vista Pictures. THREE MEN AND A BABY was a megahit as well. Both films were still in theatres by spring 1988. THREE MEN AND A BABY inspired a sequel,why didn't GMV? Obviously nobody had any ideas,not even Mitch Markowitz who composed the screenplay.
B0006399FS|5.0|No more calls please, we have our winner. Once again U2 have come up with the best rock album of the year. So what's new? These guys are running like a well-oiled machine now, showing no signs of complacency, rocking as hard as they ever have and harder than most groups young enough to be their children. How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb sounds essentially like a sequel to their previous gem, All That You Can't Leave Behind. One might suspect from the new album's title that Bono will be putting his famous political activism into song. One would be wrong. As usual the songs here are personal and laden with emotion. Bono, whose vocal range continues to astound, puts on another tour de force. The passion that he wears on his sleeve still somehow never appears contrived, it simply serves to provide drama and weight to the fine material. The Edge, guitarist extraordinaire, provides color and texture with his instantly recognizable style that somehow always sounds fresh. Clayton and Mullen are as dependable a rhythm section as ever was. These boyhood friends have now been recording music together for 25 years (or, what seems to us, an eye blink). Not only have they managed to endure, they continue to thrive. Fact is, if one may judge from the intense energy that emanates from the songs on this album, these boys appear to be getting younger. We've always suspected that Rock and Roll was the Fountain of Youth. This here is documentation.
B0002S947K|4.0|Mr. LaMontagne's \\"Trouble\\" is a terrific CD, on multiple levels. Many folks are comparing him to the inimitable Van Morrison. And while that's surely heady company to be associated with, it also carries a large load of inherent \\"trouble,\\" if you'll pardon the easy shot. <br /> <br />I can easily imagine Mr. LaMontagne has listened to \\"Astral Weeks\\" more than a few times and more than casually. No crime there.  Go ahead, name any major artist in this musical vein worth his or her measure who hasn't done the same. \\"AW\\" is a seminal reference point for any serious singer/songwriter.  <br /> <br />Nonetheless, the very burden of \\"genuis\\" Mr. Morrison has had to carry for three decades-plus should be enough to convince any aspiring artist to avoid that label. If Mr. LaMontage learns but a single thing from Van The Man, let's hope it's his integrity, principal and dedication to craft. <br /> <br />So whadda we got here? This is a superb CD, one that contains some songs that border on greatness, and therein is the promise for future efforts.  <br /> <br />I, for one, will be eagerly listening.
B000005J56|5.0|I find that a lot of world music is eerily similar to the quality of much music here in the U.S.: not quite worth being discovered.  Every now and then, though, you'll get a pleasant surprise such as this CD. What a tragic thought that these sounds and artists might have been forgotten as they had even become in their own country.    Which brings up another point:  it truly takes a pseudo-enlightened brat to look at this CD, what it's done for both the artists and those who've enjoyed it, and start squalling about Ry Cooder getting his filthy white hands all over it.  My God, where does arrogance of this sort grow? Ry Cooder's hand was essential in bringing this to the rest of the world...otherwise you would have found it all on your own,  now wouldn't you?      Hats of to Ry Cooder & these fabulous artists who have caused my CD collection to grow and my wallet to shrink.
B0000640SA|5.0|.sdrawkcab dlot si otnemeM  Excuse me.  I mean, Memento is told backwards, with the end at the beginning and the beginning at the end.  The story revolves around Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), an ex-insurance claims investigator who had to give up his job after he lost his ability to create new memories.  He lives by taking photos and keeping notes of his life. <br />The last thing he remembers is two men raping and killing his wife.  So he has dedicated his new life to finding- and killing- the man who killed his wife and took away his memory.  All he knows about the man are the few facts that he pulled from the police file from the accident: his name is either John or James, and his surname's initial is G (John or James G.).  The man has a connection to illegal drugs, and he has a license plate number.  Along the way, he is joined by Teddy (Joe Pantoliano), a guy who he fears he cannot trust, and Natalie, a woman helping him out of pity.  Unfortunately for Leonard, though, his notes can be manipulated, and he soon realizes that no one can be fully trusted. <br />The great thing about the way this movie is told is that, since we haven't seen the events leading up to a scene, we are just as in the dark about the situation as Leonard, and just when we think we have something figured out, our beliefs can be shattered in an instant when the truth is revealed. <br />You'd think that with the end at the beginning, it would be impossible for there to be a twist ending (I know I thought so), but just the opposite is true; the final scene of this film will completely blow you away. <br />This is one of the few thrillers as of late that succeeds in it's mission statement; to keep the viewer guessing and to deliver a killer twist ending.  I guarantee you'll be thinking about this film long after it is over.
B00026W82U|4.0|Keep this to a hush, but there is a new, so far unnamed sub-genre in Rock `n Roll. We'll name it \\"Whisper Rock\\" and let the trendoids follow. It is basically self-explanatory. Pretty, understated, acoustic or quietly electronic music, whether upbeat or melancholy, with vocals rarely rising above the conversational tones of the late, great Mr. Rogers or Captain Kangaroo. This music may have its antecedents with the likes of The Fleetwoods or Donovan or, going back a bit further, 12th Century Monks, but it seems to have begat the recent likes of Cat Power and Iron and Wine and Belle and Sebastian and a slew of others including this Norwegian duo, Erland Oye and Eric Glambek Boe (those \\"o\\"s should have Scandanavian slashes through them) slightly better known as Kings of Convenience. These guys have written a batch of lovely, catchy tunes sung in graceful 2-part harmony in impeccable English, no less. The only additional voice is that of a female named simply Feist whose 2 small, sweet contributions certify the album as a keeper.
6303109950|5.0|All the actors did a great job, but, I think Doc/Kilmer is the one who really put the fire in this movie. He was so \\"cool\\" I loved it. Nobody could beat him in anything he did, he was the best at everything and even his sickness didn't dampen his spirit. I can't watch the part when he gives his last words to his best friend Wyatt. I think it's just too sad to see such a vibrant fire burn out. (I cried everytime I seen it, so I quit watching that part) Otherwise the movie was excellent.
068987474X|4.0|Men like the chase and it's as simple as that.  Nothing in this book came as a surprise for me.  It did affirm what I intuitively knew but perhaps doubted, in an effort to excuse ambiguous feelings from emotionally unavailable men.      I can't tell you how many times, I've allowed myself to be fooled by men who act wildly attracted to me and even make that declaration..but then proceed to do nothing about it-- and get involved with someone else.      It doesn't matter if they are attracted to you.  Unless they are wooing and pursuing THEY ARE NOT THAT INTO YOU.    When a man is into you, and you are into him, the relationship flows.  Everything else is a waste of time.  In my opinion.
B00005V3Z4|1.0|The first thing that occurs to me when I think of this movie is a quote from the Simpsons.  Moe has radically remodeled his bar, and it is now filled with assorted eurotrash, yuppies and pseudo-hipsters.  Homer and friends appear at the grand re-opening and are taken aback by the crowd and environment.  Looking up at a TV above the bar that is showing an image of an eyeball blinking and looking wildly around, they ask him what the hell it's for.  \\"It's po-mo\\" says Moe. This elicits no reply from the guys. \\"You know, post-modern?\\" Silence.  \\"Weird for the sake of weird.\\"  <br /> <br />That would be my phrase of choice to sum up Donnie Darko; or perhaps better put \\"Ironic for the sake of Ironic\\".  Why set your supposedly \\"deeply affecting\\" sci-fi, teen coming of age story in the 80's?  So you can set a SLOW MOTION montage (let me repeat that; SLOW MOTION MONTAGE) to Head Over Heels of course! Wait, WAIT!  Couldn't you also have a group of stony faced pre-teen girls in silver leotards perform an interprative dance to Notorious?  GENIUS I say!  Also that way you could have your attractive and (mostly) talented cast dress up in unflattering clothing as well.  Hell, you'd even have an excuse to use that lame Smurf discussion that's been sticking out like a sore thumb in all your other screenplays.  Cheap, CHEAP devices.  These are the kind of jokes that require no insight or thought on the part of their creator. They only provide a laugh of recognition, a self satisfied feeling that you are cool enough to know the non-sequitur or kitsch factor inherent in the scene you're watching.  Really now, it's basically a hyper-intellectuallized  version of MAD TV at that point.   <br /> <br />Every single component of this movie simply SCREAMS at the audience \\"I AM SO AMAZINGLY CLEVER!\\" or, alternately \\"I AM SO AMAZINGLY LAZY!\\"  It feels like the filmmakers just threw on screen some commonly accepted cinematic signifiers of profundity, social commentary, romance, or what have you,and called it a day. Having stilted line readings and a non-linear plot does not make a film profound.  Having a soundtrack that sounds like a VH1 list show does not make a film clever.  Ending a film with a major sacrifice on the part of one of the main characters is meaningless if you have not earned any sort of emotional investment from the audience.  There is a distinct coldness and distance between the audience and the characters in this movie, which wouldn't be a problem if the movie then didn't expect you to care about the budding of young love and the self sacrifice it compels young lovers towards.  Countless people have told me that this film has literally moved them to tears.  I genuinely don't understand how a movie with such an icy, cynical void at its center could do that.  I'm not saing that I sit around and watch Shakespeare in Love on an endless loop all day, but this movie claims it's one thing (love/coming of age story), but does everything in its power to convince you otherwise.  It lacks commitment to any one point, outlook or plot thread and ends up not accomplishing anything; that is, anything aside from annoying me to the core of my being.  <br /> <br />Oh, and Drew Barrymore's performance was stunningly bad.
B0002S947K|3.0|The opening title track on this debut album serves as both a blessing and a curse. It is a timeless, earthy, powerful song that grabs the listener by both ears and hangs on tight. It could be an out-take from `Moondance' or `Saint Dominic's Preview'. It leads you to believe you have struck the mother lode. Unfortunately, all that follows pales in comparison. Although the rest of the songs are decent efforts in a folk/r&B hybrid and Lamontagne proves himself a strong, distinctive singer throughout, he never again approaches the urgency of that opening cut. Likewise, while production by the highly skilled Ethan Johns showcases Lamontagne's material in the finest possible light, Mr. Johns' presence also reminds us that, as a songwriter, at this stage of his career, Lamontagne is not quite in a league with Johns' former collaborator, Ryan Adams. This record still is an enjoyable listen to an artist bristling with potential.
B0006399FS|1.0|U2 have not been sell out?  U2 are not robbing to their fans?  it's time to draw the line:  Just visit [...] That page is the clearest example of which U2 have become. A company with aims of profit, able to sell every single crap as possible, even a stupid interview done by the same page. Other sites U2-related ( unnofficials ) have updated information much more quickly, offer videos for FREE, COMPLETE songs, live MP3, interviews, etc.  EVERYTHING FOR FREE.  But on [...] they only offer all that material with an extra charge ( so much expensive, by the way ).  The people whom don't have credit cards obtain delayed informations - with very poor quality - , 30 seconds of a crappy \\"new\\" video clip that in other sites can be seen COMPLETE several days earlier, etc. Memberships ( who pay for all that stuff ) are charged twice for the same thing. \\"U2 aren't sell outs\\"...    For worse, I'm fond of bootlegs. I have more than 300 ones, and I had always collected them. Since among fans there's a special brotherhood, we shared unofficial sfuff - without selling it of course... until U2 had the stupid idea that bootlegs had to be sold by them. The interchange finished, now people must pay for bootlegs like \\"New Year's Concert 1989\\" and many others we already had. Thus that's going to be in their next tour, where we won't be able to share music anymore... isn't all that \\"selling outs ?\\".    What more want U2?  they have EVERYTHING, all the money they want, all the fame they want, all the awards they want, all the cover magazines they want, but that's not enough for them. They signed an horrible agreement with iPod and Apple Tunes, in where even it's necessary to pay for all those songs 1980 - 2002 that already we had !!. isn't \\"selling outs ?\\".     Did you listen to their lastest presentations ?  they have been all performances of third category. The band doesn't have any energy on the stage, Bono sings terrible, with a hoarse, rough and very poor voice. The songs sound boring, flat, filler, specially the new ones... and more above they dare to charge to listen to them !  they would have to pay us to have to stand those performances instead !. Yet are you going to pay 150 dollars for a seat ?.  This blind subordination to U2 doesn't have any sense.  If you allow them todo everything they want, to charge everything what they want, no matter that they ignore to you as person, you are completely lost way my friends.
B0002X314C|5.0|Most people have already said what I have to say, but this is an excellent album. Finally a talent that matches the depth and skill of Alicia Keys. John's songs have style and finesse. He carries out this album like a real pro. This debut is way above your average. It's sharp and impressive. John Legend leaves you wanting more.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|Kudos to Ron Howard! This is one of the best inspirational movies I have seen in a long time. Nash is more than just an eccentric, nutty Princeton mathematics professor. He has schizophrenia and struggles hard, but like many of us, to 'come to terms' with love, uncertainty, his thoughts, dreams & fantasies, and his perception of reality.<br /><br />The movie also, in some ways, challenges stereotyped ideas about mental illness and our notion of absolute facts and 'truths'. Although the perseverative and psychotic symptoms of Nash's illness are very frustrating to watch, his character invokes enough sympathy to make the viewer almost wish his stories were true and that he's really not mentally ill.<br /><br />Superb acting by Russell Crowe, Jennifer Connelly and Ed Harris.  Overall, this film creatively and intensely illustrates the power of love and the resiliency & triumph of the human spirit.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Thank god for The WB. It has been a while since there has been a family drama that is so refrshingly honest, sincere, engaging, and brave. Since it's debut in September of 2002, this show has emerged as the crown jewel in the network's arsenal. Filled with fresh stories and new twists on old conventions, this show also boasts an incredible cast who bring to life realistic and engaging characters. This show continues to grow and expand on this brilliance in it's two subsequent seasons. Do not let the reviews who state otherwise fool you. It stays true to itself in later seasons and I can only assume these reviewers were unhappy with what happened and toss it off as \\"bad\\" or \\"not as good\\" simply because they didn't get it. Thank god the critics and real fans do. Treat Williams stars as famed New York surgeon, Dr. Andrew Brown. A workaholic with a wife and 2 kids. When tragedy strikes the family, he makes an about face in his life and moves his kids to the idyllic town of Everwood, Colorado. There he sets up shop with a practice in the town's old train station, which is right across the street from the town's only other physician, Dr. Harold Abbott(perfectly played by the fantastic Tom Amandes). Andy's son is 16 year old Ephram(The superb Gregory Smith), a loner type kid with a major chip on his shoulder concerning his father. And then there is 9 year old Delia(Vivian Cardone), a littly dynamo with a penchant for baseball caps. Others include Dr. Abbott's daughter Amy(The adorable Emily Van Camp), Abbott's son Bright(The funny Chris Pratt), Abbott's mother, and Andrew's nurse, Edna(The great Debra Mooney), her husband and town bus driver Irv(John Beasley), who is also the show's narrator, and Andy's lovely neighbor Nina(Stephanie Niznik). It had been such a long time since I had watched a stellar debut season. It was perfect. The show manages to be as realistic as possible and tries to go as far as it can with certain topics. Something I am sure the people who said theseasons afterward were no good only because they couldn't take the show's incredibly gutsy moves. One of the show's strengths is taking overused storylines and giving them a fresh and invigorated new shot at life. The ongoing arc this season between Ephram's love for Amy and her comatose boyfriend Colin Hart regaining his self and wanting to be Ephram's friend, is one cool example. The show is intelligently and creatively written, and is one of the most beautifully shot shows on television. Treat Williams has been given one heck of a career resurgence. He is so perfect for the show and this is really his moment. Where's his Emmy nod?. Tom Amandes as Dr. Abbott is right up there. He made his character a pompous fuss bucket and then turned him into a real human being who isn't all he seems. The banter and wars between him and Andy are priceless and are about as enjoyable as you can get. Episodes here range from the great to the fantastic. Some include the brilliant \\"Episode 20\\", a show about abortion. What happens is an impeccably written episode that shows both sides and different angles of the subject and it's choices. Well done. Other highlights include \\"A Thanksgiving Tale\\", \\"Is There A Doctor In The House\\", \\"The Kissing Bridge\\", \\"Colin The Second\\", and the fantastic finale, \\"Home\\". The kids here are all very well presented. Gregory Smith is a real find. A great repreentation of a young kid who isn't perfect and has issues. Emily Van Camp as Amy is his equal. Those big pretty doe eyes are nice too!. The WB should be proud. It has a show that is for everyone, and doesn't shy away from important topics. Nor does it cookie cutter it either. It's honest, tender, funny, realistic, life affirming, and brave. You will enjoy your trip to the rocky environs of Everwood. A place that you will want to visit again season after season. Enjoy your stay.
068987474X|1.0|I have grown very suspicious of any book appearing on Oprah; of the many of those I have read, only one (Steinbeck's East of Eden) seems to have been written by a decent author.  This particular book is no exception.  I would have hoped that two \\"acknowledged\\" writers would have been better able to produce a work of passable literature.  <br /> <br />As far as advice goes, the authors do a decent job of stating the obvious...which many of us offtimes need.  The examples, however are tritely written; I found myself skimming this book, and was done with it in about half an hour.   <br /> <br />Borrow it from a friend or library, just don't buy it.
B000059XUI|5.0|To me, the original \\"Superman\\" movie is, and always will be, the best comic book/superhero movie of all time. There have been a few since the 1978 classic that have come close, but none have matched the magic and scope of the classic original. This 1981 sequel to the smash hit is a wonderful sequel that nearly captures and matches the same fun and class as the first film. Why people have had such problems with this movie is beyond me. Director Richard Lester has gotten a lot of bad press for the work he did on the film, and though it may not be Richard Donner standards, he still did a great job. He made the movie look and feel like a real comic book adventure. Wether or not it's true that Dick Donner stepped in and did some work on the movie on his own is true or not, I have no idea. The movie is epic in scope as the first film, and delivers the goods. This time out, her hero(once again played superbly by the late great Christopher Reeve), is conflicted between his role as superhero, and his love for Lois Lane(Margot Kidder). Once he decides to give up his role as superhero and manages to become human, things go haywire. Don't they always?. The moment he settles into his new life as a human with Lois, three villains from his home planet of Krypton, who've been trapped by Jor-El, escape and come to earth where they begin to wreak havoc and just naturally act as villains do. They get help when they are aided by Superman's arch nemesis Lex Luthor, once again played by the scene stealing Gene Hackman. The movie is definitley a visual delight, and everybody involved puts in their all to deliver a non stop action/adventure that delivers. The heroic moments are incredible, and the effects are so much better and natural looking than in most of the superhero/adventure movies nowadays. And this was 1981!. Christopher Reeve continues to make both Superman and Clark Kent fleshed out characters. He may put on glasses and everybody doesn't know who he is, but he does such a goodjob of seperating the two into two completely different personalities, that there is no way this guy could be one in the same. He is great. Everybody else does their part. Kidder is perky and headstrong as Lois Lane, and Gene Hackman, as always, steals every scene he is in. The three Krypton villains, Zod, Non, And Ursa, are a dastardly trio, wonderfully brought to life with uber-villainy camp by Terence Stamp(who here lately has been providing the voice for Jor-El on \\"Smallville\\"), Sarah Douglas, and the never speaking Jack 'O' Halloran. Some moments here stand out among all others. Most notably the big showdown in downtown Metropolis with the three villains causing utter chaos, and the fight with Superman. Without a doubt, the best part of the movie, and one of the best superhero/adventure moments ever. While the film may feel a bit jerky here and there, and not have a clear and precise narrative, it is still brilliantly done and put together. A superhero that is almost as heroic as it's classic original. The new movie, \\"Superman Returns\\", directed by Bryan Singer, which is scheduled for release in 2006, is said to take up after this movie. Let's hope Singer and crew do the series and the character justice.

B000059Z8J|5.0|Originally released in 1978, this first film in the series, directed by Richard Donner, became, and still is, the blue print for the perfect superhero/comic book movie. All future movies of it's kind should be so good. Unfortunatley, most of them haven't been. Save a few. This original film was the \\"origin\\" of Superman and Clark Kent. Telling it from the beginning. Basically, here is the story. On the planet of Krypton, about to meet it's end, Jor-El and his wife Lara, send their baby son Kal-El to earth in a small spaceship. Ot crash lands in the small farming town of Smallville, Kansas. The little boy is picked up by local couple, Jonathan and Martha Kent(Glen Ford, Phyllis Thaxter). Right off the bat, the little boy showed super powers. Flash forward several years, and young Clark(as they named him, and played by Jeff East for these scenes), is leaving home. Read to go out on his own and find out who he is and his true calling. Once he makes it to Metropolis, Christopher Reeve steps into the role. He gets a job as a reporter for The Daily Planet, under the employment of Rough and grumy Perry White(The great Jackie Cooper). Soon, Clark is accquainted with feisty reporter Lois Lane(Margot Kidder), and boyishly wholesome photographer, Jimmy Olsen(Marc McClure). Gene Hackman plays millionaire madman, Lex Luthor. With the help of his sidekicks Otis(Ned Beatty), and Miss Tesmacher(Valerie Perrine), Lex plans on taking over the world, unless Superman can stop him. Ned Beatty and Valerine Perrine donate some comedic relief to the proceedings as Lex's team. This is a real high class production. The performances are well done and fleshed out, and carry the film to the grand adventure that it is. Reeve was a virtual unknown at the time, and was only 26 I believe. He did a phenomenal job his first time out, brillaintly creating two seperate people in one, with Superman and Clark. He was wonderful. Hackman is a pro, and he chews the scenery with scene stealing bravado, owningevery frame he is in. Kidder was perfectly cast as Lois Lane. She had that right sense of perkiness, determination, and strength, that makes the character endearing. Cooper is a delight with his portrayal of Perry, and McClure brings the right level of 'ah shucks' to his bow tied photographer. One cannot exclude Marlon Brando, who was paid millions for his few days(and few minutes)of work on the film. The script is expertly written by Mario Puzo(\\"The Godfather\\"). It is such a well structured script that tells the beginning, and origin, of the legend, and is incredibly tight. Richard Donner's direction was flawless. He captures every scene and makes every moment count. There are numerous scenes here etched in fans' heads, and lines as well, and that makes for a rather unforgettable adventure. There are also some nice little cameos in the movie. The original Superman, Kirk Alyn, plays Lois' father early in the movie when they are on a train, and the original TV lois, Noel Neil, plays her mom. Now, with Bryan Singer doing \\"Superman Returns\\" for 2006, with Brandon Routh as Clark/Superman, Kate Bosworth as Lois, and Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor, he has a lot to live up too. With Spacey being cast, it's already on the right track. The best superhero movie of all time.
0679805273|5.0|I was utterly petrified.<br /><br />I couldn't find a physics book.<br /><br />Believe me I tried.<br /><br />I searched my home and the library too.<br /><br />But all I found was \\"Principals of Math Principals\\"<br /><br />Copyright 1932,<br /><br />I spun around and collapsed in despair.<br /><br />I landed with a small thud,<br /><br />On a small cushioned chair.<br /><br />A man in a small yellow cap met my gaze.<br /><br />I pondered a short moment,<br /><br />In my mind went a blaze!<br /><br />I asked around and when everyone said no.<br /><br />I decided to make my physics book,<br /><br />\\"Oh the places you'll go\\".  (author Dr. Seuss)<br /><br /> So I picked up this book and started to flip through it. You would not believe the amount of physics I found in this book! Not physics in the sense that the guy in the yellow cap was solving projectile motion,  but a much more practical kind. How does one \\"Go\\" somewhere? Well we all know that Force equals Mass multiplied by Acceleration, but to move where he wants, he will have to have velocity, which is speed (m/s) with a vector. If this little yellow guy really wants to travel the world he is going to need to apply some physics. If the guy is to move at constant velocity, Newton's first law says that the three force vectors acting on it must add up to zero. But do you really think he is going to apply Newton's first law? Probably not. Most likely he will travel at a somewhat dull and variable speed. Lets cut him a little slack though and say that he does want the forces to add up to 0. Well, he will have to take into account gravity pulling down, the incline of the land and we will assume that air resistance and friction are not an issue. So there you go, he has a shot. On page twelve LYG (little yellow guy) says \\"You'll join the high fliers who soar to high heights.\\" He is seen flying in a big hot air balloon. So the LYG pulled a fast one and used the old hot air rises trick. He fought the -9.8m/s² of gravity with a bunch of less dense air. He did this by using a burner ((ignited propane (C3H8)) that stimulated the molecules causing them to be less dense. The dense air around this hot air weighs more, pushing the lighter air upward. This does not last however a process called adiabatic cooling keeps the air from rising constantly. What have we learned? Not that hot air rises, but that cold air sinks! So to maintain the upper hand of gravity one must continue to heat the air. What have we learned? Not that hot air rises, but that cold air sinks! Ok, so the guy really will \\"Soar to high heights\\".<br /><br />So is that all of the physics this LGY can apply?<br /><br />No my friend he flies a kite toward the sky.<br /><br />Oh here we go again. Now he is defying gravity not with hot air but with wind. So how does wind work? Well... it has to do with hot air so I guess my previous statement was incorrect. Wind is merely air that is in motion. This motion is caused by hot air rising. This of course is not caused only by hot air balloons (some \\"balloonists\\" argue otherwise)  but by solar radiation from the sun heating the earth. This does not heat the air directly by the surface of the Earth instead which in turn heats the air which causes the colder air to  fall because of gravity and create motion in the air, aka wind. The hot air moves from the equator to both the North and South Poles creating air movement in the atmosphere. So the movement of the air is stopped by the kit and battles gravity to move upward.<br /><br />So it was pulled of regardless of schematics<br /><br />I learned a lot from this book....<br /><br />A lot about mathematics.<br /><br />If this does not work out and I end up on my caboose<br /><br />I will be knocking at your door<br /><br />Mr. Dr. Seuss.trick.

B0000CFW87|1.0|I love all kinds of music (SEE MY OTHER REVIEWS for proof) This just has been released to annoy. And as another artist for Adult Contemporary radio stations to play to death. <br /> <br />He may not sound like Bolton (no need to clear THIS throat) but he sings the same, sappy garbage. The previous reviewer who compares \\"You Raise Me Up\\" to Wind Beneath My Wings is dead on. I didnt realise it until i listened to it again. <br /> <br />You Raise Me Up is one of those &lt;sarcasm> sad tearjerker songs. Kind of like I'm Already There by Lonestar. Makes you want to weep in the cornflakes. <br /> <br />Unless you are a panty throwing woman (or gay) you would be best to steer away from tripe like this. If you do like it, I recommend titles by Wilson Phillips, Air Supply, Kenny G and Yanni

There IS something we can do about cancer, heart disease as well as many other diseases and it is as simple as the foods we eat. I've purchased several copies of this book for friends and relatives and they have all found it as inspiring as I have.<br /><br />This is a book that will change your life.
B0006HXXBA|5.0|Wow, Enemy of God is such a great album I don't even know where to start. First of all the production on this album kills. You can hear the drums, guitar, vocals, and most of the time bass with extreme ease and clarity. The musicianship is flawless and if you have any doubts about the guys in Kreator then you will completely change your mind once you listen to this album. The drums and guitar flow perfectly and the fills and licks are I guess you can say are as one. This album is great and I can go on for ever about its flawlessness but I will let you decide for yourself.
0767834739|5.0|Man I didn't think a sequel would be just as good as the first!! WOW! I really really liked this movie, it had a different feeling than the first. You could tell they spent more money and time on this one than the first. I loved the whole story and the humour that was added!!<br />Hey and I even recognized some scenes that are in the FMV in the games! Really cool.<br />The extras are plentiful and great! The outtakes are really funny!<br />Buy this movie it rocks!
B00004HYLF|2.0|This is album with no emotion, passion or sense at all!!!!!!!! It sounds like a computer midi file.
B0000046X0|5.0|Another raw, uncompromising fusion classic that still sounds wonderfully fresh now, some 30 years after it was unleashed on an unsuspecting public. <br /> <br />I'm sure this outing dropped some jaws in its day, especially considering that the 2 previous RTF discs (Return to Forever, Light As A Feather) were steeped in airy Brazilian jazz-samba sensibilities. Here, Chick Corea and his trusty bassist Stanley Clarke (just returning to electric bass) would change their whole sound and direction, adding in heavy rock and more orchestrated ensemble playing. An early lineup (which included drummer Steve Gadd, percussionist Mingo Lewis and guitarist Earl Klugh) gave way to the scorching lineup of Corea, Clarke, drummer Lenny White and a young unknown guitarist in the person of Bill Connors. Chick and Stanley's new musings were well served by the 2 new members. Lenny White's drumming combined the best aspects of a great jazz drummer, the ferocious power of a rocker and the funkiness of Clyde Stubblefield (James Brown) or Bernard Purdie. Bill Connors bought to the table a yearning to combine John Coltrane and Cream-period Eric Clapton into a unique musical voice. The new band was NEVER shy about flexing its musical muscles or taking chances right and left.  <br /> <br />The opening title cut makes it screamingly clear that this was a band of great musical minds to be reckoned with, highlighted by tight ensemble passages and reckless abandon working together in amazing ways. The song has a very endearing hanging on for dear life quality to it. \\"After The Cosmic Rain\\" gives bassist Stanley Clarke a chance to shine with thick fuzzy propulsive bass lines and a nasty, snarly solo, not unlike a more manic Jack Bruce (in fact, Stanley used the same bass as Jack, a Gibson EB-3, famous for its fuzzy somewhat muddy sound. Shortly after these recordings, Stanley would trade it in for the crisp, crackling Alembic sound that would become his stock in trade.)  <br /> <br />\\"Captain SeorMouse\\" is a classic Corea musing featuring a manic and beautiful flamenco-inspired melody line and a dizzying variety of time changes, plus crafty use of exaggerated dynamics and tight, passionate ensemble work from everybody. \\"Theme To The Mothership\\" by stark contrast is a more open-ended full-throttle piece, giving Bill Connors a chance to unleash a soaring melodic solo, beginning with thick slicing sustained notes and gradually building to a barely controlled fury before miraculously landing right on the next ensemble passage. After this, Corea lets forth a brilliant ring-modulated Fender Rhodes solo that would have been right at home on a Soft Machine or Hatfield and the North disc.  <br /> <br />\\"Space Circus\\" begins with low-key child-like whimsy before charging into a full-on funk workout, with everybody trading off searing phrases like Muhammad Ali and Joe Frasier in the ring. \\"The Gamemaker\\" sneaks up on you with a mysterious series of organ chords and Corea gently musing over the top of it gradually morphing into a repeating keyboard figure that frames the piece that the band picks up on and adds momentum to. From that point, Corea and Connors engage in a duel to the death, beating each other creatively silly as Clarke and White drive it along at a furious pace, leading to a nail-biting unison-passage ending.  <br /> <br />This is a disc that will leave you exhausted in a wonderful way, kind of like a good downhill ski run or roller coaster ride. This is tightly played and orchestrated fusion at its boldest, rawest and uncompromising for its time. While subsequent RTF albums were more refined, and guitarist Al DiMeola may have been a superior technician/chopsmeister, Bill Connors just had a raw soulfulness and passionate abandon that DiMeola could never get close to (plus I happen to LOVE that thick, slicing tone of Bill's). The album's raw, in-your-face production just adds to the charm of hearing a new band flexing its musical muscles and breaking new ground. <br /> <br />Absolutely essential!  <br />
B000002NAK|5.0|The fantastic Broadway musical lost nothing on its way to the silver screen.  In fact, it gained in spectacle and intensity.  Madonna is perfect here; it's hard to believe there was ever a question of another actress playing this role. Antonio's also a fine singer and deserved his Golden Globe nomination.  The soundtrack has every note of music from the movie, so listening to it is like rewatching the film.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napoleon Dynamite is a VERY funny movie, with many one liners that arent really supposed to be funny, but really are funny because of the way Napoleon says them ('Idiots' 'Gosh') The reason I give it 4 stars instead of 5 is because i do believe that the movie is given a LITTLE too much credit than it deserves...The movie has absolutely zero point, nothing. There are many errors and mistakes that you can find if you go to moviemistakes.com. But, it is an independent film so you cannot expect a perfect movie. However, where the film lacks in plot it more than makes up for it with hilarious scenes one after another. I found myself laughing nearly every scene...i would recommend this movie especially if you are watching with friends, because everything is funnier while with your friends.
B00005JMUA|3.0|The Bride (Uma Thurman) completes her mission to kill Bill (David Carradine), dispatching a few other obstacles along the way.  This film is quieter than the first, much to its detriment.  Volume 1 managed to overcome writer/director Quentin Tarantino's directorial gimmicks and stilted dialogue during its many inspired action scenes.  Here, the gimmicks remain but there is less action to redeem it.  Something in me still responds to his characters, but I think Tarantino is well on his way to being the most overrated director of our time.  The long, geeky speeches that seemed fresh in \\"Pulp Fiction\\" are tipping over the border into self-parody (although I did think that David Carradine's speech about Superman toward the end was brilliant; whoever makes the next movie about the Man of Steel should take note).  With all the critical and popular success he is enjoying, there is no reason to expect him to restrain himself in the future./
0440237688|4.0|What a surprising book.  From the name alone you can never guess what this book is going to be about.  There are so many twists and turns throughout that it is such a quick read and keeps the reader on the edge of the seat.  I would recommend this book to anyone of all ages and reading levels. <br />
0316776963|4.0|Finally I jumped on the David Sedaris bandwagon, this being the first book by him I've read. It truly is pretty funny. It's a series of essays about his wacky family, living in France, and being on the subversive side of a very straight-laced U.S.<br /><br />The book cover blurbs oversold it. I read reviewers say they \\"screamed with laughter\\" or found it \\"sidesplitting\\" or \\"wildly entertaining.\\" It's mildly entertaining. Don't expect to scream with laughter.<br /><br />You also have to suspend your belief to some degree. Exaggeration is okay but it's probably a major part of this autobiographical book. The first half is about growing up and adult life, and the second half is about life in France. There's not a lot of continuity here: it's truly a random collection of essays.<br /><br />I don't want to leave a totally negative impression. Let me tell you two of my favorite lines from the book:<br /><br />\\"...my childhood was unspeakably dull. When I was seven years old, my family moved to North Carolina. When he was seven years old, Hugh's family moved to the Congo. We had a collie and a house cat. They had a monkey and two horses named Charlie Brown and Satan.\\"<br /><br />Another, about a speech therapy class for boys with lisps: \\"When asked what we wanted to be when we grew up, we hid the truth and listed who we wanted to sleep with when we grew up: `A policeman or a fireman or one of those guys who works with high-tension wires.'\\"
B000002J09|5.0|If you are getting into progressive rock, hard rock, oldies or whatever it's called in 2005...get this one.  It is essential. <br />Also check out the 1st and Physical Graffiti as excellent blues based progressive rock music.  But ZOSO is essential.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Frankly, Napoleon Dynamite is probably one of my favorite movies to have been released last year.  While this movie does not seem to appeal to the type of crowd that doesn't appreciate obscurity, anyone else can't help but laugh at the antics of this odd teen from Preston, Idaho.  The movie is nothing more than a look into Napoleon's awkward life, so if you're looking for a deep, engrossing movie, you might want to look elsewhere.  Every character in this movie is memorable in my mind, whether it be Napoleon with his taste for drawing fantasy figures or Uncle Rico with his apparent desire to go back to a simpler time (that time being the 80's).  Simply put, this movie is hilarious thoughout, a shear pleasure to watch.  The fact that it is free of any sort of obscenity or profanity is refreshing in a time when no good movie is capable of getting anything less than a PG-13 rating.  Do yourself a favor and purchase this movie (I would suggest passing on the soundtrack, soundbytes from the movie are of very little interest).
B00004XQP4|1.0|This album is horrendous, it never should have been released. It shows Green Day running out of gas, churning out three- minute pop songs. I bought this cd and regretted it immediately. Sure, some of the songs like 'church on sunday' and 'waiting' sound ok, but overall the album is a waste of your time and money. Green Day's old school stuff was awesome, raw, and honest material. Dookie and Insomniac are both awesome, and Nimrod shows Green Day at their creative peak, but it seemed that Green Day were on the downside of their career when this came out in 2000. American Idiot is their first good album in 7 years. So, once again, Warning is garbage and is not worth your money. If you are just checking out Green Day buy Dookie, Insomniac, Nimrod, and American Idiot.
B000002B1M|5.0|Without a doubt the greatest rap album in the history. How can anybody hate on it is beyond me. People wanna compare it to Illmatic, but comme on. How can you compare it to Illmatic? Illmatic is Ilmatic, It Was Written is It Was Written point blank period. Do you people expect him to make every album sounding like Illmatic or what??? How many classic songs he got on this album is not even funny. Psstttt... Intro is hot. The Message is the sickest song that you ever gonna hear. Real hardcore gansta beat/spitting combo ever done. Street Dreams hot. I Gave You Power.....I mean if even Tupac bites that style and makes the song about his girl you can only see where I'm going. Watch Dem N***as layed back beat and smooth delivery by Nas with Foxy on hooks. Take It In Blood, wooooahh now that is some serious heat. Beat is mysterious, flow is off the hook, words are ridiculous Top 10 song of alltime. Nas Is Coming hot song with Dre. Beat is fire, Nas delivers right. I don't know why so much hate on this song. Affirmative Action pheeewww another classic gem. Includes Foxy, Cormega, and Nas' long time friend and brethren AZ. \\"My mind sees through your design like Blind Fury\\"-Nas what else can I say. The Set Up slept on song, Nas spitts some real s**t on it as always. Black Girl Lost wooow, beautiful song. Love song, with nice sexy chorus. Suspect the most slept on song probably on this album, Nas takes it back to Illmatic style and drops some wordage barrage. Shootouts the sick gansta song, beat is siiiick, words are sick, classic gem. Live N***a Rap is hot song with Mobb Deep, classic stuff with his duns from QB. Fire! And last but not least of course If I Ruled The World- the art, the beauty, the struggle, the ups and downs, this is the song for you. Might just be the best beat ever made at least for a rap album and definately top 10 all-time. Nas spitts about lifes struggles, $$$$ lust, just straight knowledge dropping song. Featuring Lauren Hill on hooks.    If I can giveit 1 billion stars I sure would. The Greatest LP to Ever Hit Stores.    Peace

Christopher is a remarkable teacher.  <br /> <br />As we come to know Christopher, we learn the value of single-minded purpose - Christopher's obsession to do well on his A-maths exam. Need for order and personal space are tucked away Christopher's box of Clementines, licorice whips, etc.  <br /> <br />He forces us to understand how some people need to retreat from the confusion of crowds, loud sounds and mixed messages. Christopher takes a breather by covering his ears, moaning or locking himself away. <br /> <br />Yet, a sad and over-arching theme clouds Christopher's perception of the world - his inability to comprehend the subtle aspects of irony and the nuances of emotion manifested by his parents and those he meets. <br /> <br />The author has remarkable understanding of \\"special\\" populations.
B00005B36H|5.0|The best tool album recorded so far and one of the best albums of the modern rock era !
B000002VCB|4.0|A very compelling album, and it is rather down on women.  If you will take a close look at the cover, you will find large bumps of herpes/syphyllis(?) on the faces of the two women pictured. They are hidden by the veils.  Surely I'm not the only one who's noticed? Still a classic, though.
B0002IQJUK|4.0|Do like I did... Buy this album and throw away Chariot. Stripped is amazing while the regular album is lacking and could be a demo for Stripped. The songs on Stripped sound how they were meant to be heard. It's almost as if Chariot was a practice session for Stripped which is fulled with so much more emotion and perfect melodies. Stripped is good enough to play all the way through. Some standouts include \\"(Nice to meet you) Anyway\\", \\"Meaning\\", \\"Chariot\\" and \\"Follow Through\\". \\"I don't want to be\\" is better on Chariot but not much. Looking forward to Gavin's next.
1592400876|2.0|If you are looking for an authoritative guidebook on punctuation, this book is not for you. Some of the reviews here on Amazon are very useful, but the best review of this book I have seen is the one that ran in The New Yorker several months back. It may be available to read online. <br /> <br />As a longtime professional editor and writer, I have read a lot of books on grammar, punctuation and style. I am definitely what the author would call a 'stickler.' I truly wanted to like this book, but I cannot recommend it. It's neither comprehensive nor authoritative. It also contains mistakes, which is unacceptable for this type of book, especially given the author's attitude toward her subject. There are ambiguities and contradictions, and some areas of punctuation are given only the most perfunctory mention, with no worthwhile information or examples beyond the superficial. The book also offers guidelines that are focused on British usage, which automatically lessens its value for the American reader. There are many significant, concrete differences in the conventions of British and American grammar and punctuation; unfortunately the author just glosses over this topic without any useful instruction. This book should have been revised for the American market in order to have maximum value.  <br /> <br />But it's not a reference volume. It's more of an essay on punctuation - and one woman's feelings about the subject - than a truly instructional work. You'd need to have a fairly limited knowledge of punctuation to gain any real insight from this book, but perhaps that is indeed the case for many of its satisfied readers. If so, great. I guess you could say this book is an attempt at 'pop punctuation with an attitude' or something like that. It tries to use caustic humor in being two things at once, but I think it comes up short on both ends. If you are looking for a true no-nonsense guide to the standard rules of punctuation, I'd recommend 'Webster's NewWorld Guide to Punctuation.'  It has everything you need, explained clearly and with strong usage examples. It's also tiny and costs $5. If you want to go beyond that for a more comprehensive volume written by a serious grammarian, get 'A Dictionary of Modern American Usage' by Bryan Garner, or his larger volume, 'Garner's Modern American Usage.' They are excellent. He explains punctuation in detail in these books - more succinctly and correctly than Ms. Truss does.

0679746048|5.0|Many novels that are written have a happy ending. In the book Girl, Interrupted, this is not the case. This memoir, written by Susanna Keysen, is the darkly humorous story of an 18 yr old girl trapped within a mental institution. She introduces characters that come and go in her boxed life and explains their history, along with an analysis of each. While out of order and slightly confusing at certain points, the book quickly straightens out and gives it a more personal feeling and being like thoughts, not a textbook. <br /> <br />After seeing a new doctor for only 20 minutes, Susanna becomes committed by him to a mental institution. She becomes friends with Polly, a girl who had covered herself in gasoline and lit herself on fire, Lisa, the insomniac who is desperate for escape, no matter how poorly she could handle the 'real world', and Daisy, a beautiful bullimic girl who gets full chickens from her dad and keeps every carcass. Among these girls, Susanna desperately searches for sanity, knowing that she was not meant to be kept locked up here. <br /> <br />Keysen uses simple, straight forward words that can not be misunderstood. This helps us easily understand the moods that each passage is supposed to give off because each word has more value and impact. Along with this, she uses short sentences that are to the point. In the book, there are no hidden meanings behind her words; what she wants you to know, she tells you instead of letting the reader figure it out for themselves. An example of this is how on the first page, Keysen asks her roomate about undergoing shock therapy.  <br /> <br />\\"And then what?\\" I asked. <br /> <br />\\"Darkness,\\" She replied. <br /> <br />This quote, in few words, captures the eerie darkness of the conversation. This is something Keysen does phenomonally throughout the book. The more you read, the more you can comprehend about her, and you learn what to expect language-wise from her. The diction seems to come out just as an ordinary person would speak, allowing you to connect better with the character because all the answers about what she means is laid out right in front of you.  <br /> <br />This book would be best recommended for women over the age of 13. The book talks about psychoanalysis and requires a certain amount of maturity to understand the nature and importance of the book. Also, this book can be recommended for those who have a dark sense of humor or like morbid books. The book describes all the disorders that each of them have and has the ability to make some of them seem comical. If you enjoyed the movie Girl, Interrupted, they will most likely enjoy reading the book, also. Two similar books are White Oleander and She's Come Undone. While White Oleander has a similar writing sense and inner conflict within the character, She's Come Undone revolves around similar ideas.  <br /> <br /> <br />

However, as I was being introduced to more of the characters, I was just finding alot to be implausible.  For example, the children's thought-process comes across much more maturely than given their actual ages.  The grandmother of the raped and dead granddaughter seemed more like a distant and uncompassionate relative visiting for the holidays.  Later, the mother and her self-absorbed behavior. Granted, everyone mourns in his/her own way...but COME ON!   <br /> <br />The third of the book dragged with needless details, not to mention it just got more eccentric. Not eccentric-interesting, rather eccentric-stupid.  Almost even seems as if two writers tag-teamed and someone else took over writing the latter 3rd of the book. The ending seemed forced and that the author just could not find a solid way to bring about a decent conclusion. <br /> <br />Bottom line:  \\"So dumb.\\"
B00008QSAA|5.0|Mountain's 1970 classic, _Climbing_ is one of the most essential hard rock albums right up there with any classic album from Led Zeppelin, Hendrix or Cream. Featuring the superlative vocal and guitar talents of the great Leslie West and co-vocalist & bassist Felix Pappalardi, Mountain turned out some of the most tasteful, melodic, passionate and searing rock to ever be experienced.<br /><br />It should be mentioned that Felix Pappalardi was famed for producing (and at times, playing instruments on) two of Cream's main classic studio albums, 1967's _Disraeli Gears_ and 1968's _Wheels of Fire_ (you should own all three of Cream's main studio albums made between 1966-1968, btw), so if any Cream attributes seem to be traced in some of Mountain's music, this should probably have a large part to do with it. And, wouldn't you know it: in addition to being the co-vocalist and bassist, he was Mountain's producer as well.<br /><br />The songs here are some of the most tasty you will ever hear in hard rock, and some of the heaviest as well; they border on classic heavy metal. The crunchy and searing tone in Leslie West's guitar is one of a fiery, yet somewhat controlled and harnessed passion. You know the famous hit \\"Mississippi Queen,\\" with it's opening cowbell hits, and that thick, searing, and equally melodic riff from Leslie West. And for the rest of the song, we are treated to more melodic riffs which burn with a searing intensity to match that of Leslie's heated, highly-passionate, throaty vocals, and vice versa. In addition to the man's ever-tasteful licks, his voice, to me, had something of a larger-than-life quality, while at the same time, being so earthy.<br /><br />When I first heard \\"Theme For An Imaginary Western,\\" I thought it was done by Jack Bruce. Sure enough, the track was actually written by Jack Bruce. This is one of the more beautiful and haunting numbers on the album, with some lovely chords and chord changes, which happen to be beautifully-smothered in the thick, rich, and oceanic tone of Leslie's guitar. Felix Pappalardi had quite a soulful voice, and when listening to how he phrases his vocals on this track, you can see why some would readily be reminded of Jack Bruce. \\"Never In My Life\\" is a fast-paced, bluesy number featuring Leslie and his array of tasteful licks, and his beautifully-raucous, inflammed vocals.<br /><br />\\"For Yasgur's Farm\\" is probably my favorite track on here. Much like \\"Theme,\\" this is one of the slow-burners on the album. Listen at those lovely arpeggiated chords and progressions, and (again) that rich, yet melodic crunch from Leslie's guitar. One thing that really moves me about this track (amongst many things) is how Felix Pappalardi offers his rich, silky-smooth R&B-esque voice on the verses, while Leslie West gets to offer his beautifully-raucous, heat-filled vocals on the chorus. How these two voices contrast with one another, along with the melodic beauty of the song itself, nearly breaks me down.<br /><br />\\"To My Friend\\" is a solo acoustic piece by Leslie West, which starts off fairly serene and beautiful, and only escalates in speed and intensity as the time-length progresses. Not something to be taken too lightly. \\"The Laird\\" is a mellow number, which has an exotic atmosphere to it, mainly due to the percussion, and Felix's dreamy vocals also add to this aspect as well. After the last two breaks, we are thrown right back into the searing intensity of the past tracks, with \\"Sittin' On A Rainbow\\", which features some thick, monstrous pounding from drummer Corky Laing, and what else needs to be said about Leslie West? The song is also dominated by his gigantic vocals, and his ever-tasty leads and -- once again -- that excellent tone and crunch. \\"Boys In The Band\\" is a multi-faceted number which opens with minor-key piano chords, descending basslines, and sprinkles of Leslie's tasteful licks, which give this track something of a darkly-elegant beauty. We are then treated to a thick,sludgy teetering progression before the beautiful, bluesy chorus comes in. This is an excellent track that cleary has far more going for it than many would suspect on the surface.<br /><br />As a bonus, we get excellent and insightful liner notes from Leslie West and Corky Laing (Leslie's are particularly laugh-out-loud hilarious) and a bonus cut, which is a live version of \\"For Yasgur's Farm.\\"<br /><br />This album deserves to be in any hard rock lover's collection, or for anyone who is interested in tastefully-crafted and passionate music. Also consider 1971's _Nantucket Sleighride_.beautiful, bluesy chorus comes in. This is an excellent track that cleary has far more going for it than many would suspect on the surface.

0517548232|5.0|This is, in my opinion, the most important introduction to economics ever written.  I began to read with some doubt that it could be of any interest.  It not only captured my interest but set me on a path of new discovery making a subject I formerly considered so much witchcraft into a subject that permeates virtually every aspect of our lives.  It is the founding theory that can make us a truly free people or enslaved to economic failures.<br /><br />No other book has dispelled the myths and fallacies that have plagued economic study like this one.<br /><br />It is a book for every citizen before he votes or runs for even the office of dog-catcher.  Read and follow it with Hayek's [[ASIN:0226320553 The Road to Serfdom: Text and Documents--The Definitive Edition (The Collected Works of F. A. Hayek)]] for even greater understanding.
B000002J1L|5.0|I put my original worn-out vinyl album in a garage sale during the mid-1980s transition to CDs. Recently, I broke down and bought this wonderful remastered edition. It has been like re-connecting with an old friend. Gosh, was there anything better than those 1970-74 Genesis albums? I find everyone who followed the band during that era to still cherish those recordings. Strangely, if you missed the era, you don't seem to care. My son, an accomplished musician, loves 1960s and 1970s rock, but doesn't get the whole art-rock phase, and NC leaves him cold. He thinks the guitar and keyboard solos sound like uninspired scale exercises. I guess you had to be there.
B00001NFCY|5.0|It's a pity that Creed gets so much bad press. People tend to focus on Stapp's shortcomings and not ever really hear the music. <br />That said, this is by far my favorite Creed album and probably my favorite album ever. I say probably accounting for the recent release of Alter Bridge's One Day Remains.  <br />One thing I love about Creed is the range of emotion they can portray in their songs. The first track Are you Ready? is almost setting you up for the whole experience. It's a strong opener, but it's followed by the nearly full metal song called What If. It starts soft, but quickly hits you with strong guitar chords and beautifully angry lyrics. Beautiful and Say I are equally well written. Say I has an incredibly haunting guitar in it, Wrong Way does indeed have a nice chorus, although a rather obsure message. Never Die has a unique chord to it, one I grew to adore over time, as well as wonderful imagery in the lyrics and a great finish. Faceless Man is one of the most diverse songs on the album, going from slow and soft to intense and edgy. This is one song that deserves more attention than it gets. Anyone getting the Greatest Hits album is missing out. Next is my favorite song, Higher. The guitar is awesome - powerful and beautiful. There is a sublime hope in the guitar and something in Stapp's voice, the sheer emotion, the makes me cry almost everytime I hear it. It's for this song that I love this album. With Arms Wide Open is perhaps their most famous song. A sweet and solid ballad. But even coming from a HUGE Creed fan, it was overplayed. I usually skip it. Wash Away those Years is a good song with touching lyrics. Inside Us All is quite uplifting, although it gets a bit repetitive near the end like it's epic album ender from My Own Prison, One. Still good though.  <br />Overall I see this is just great rock and roll. Consider giving it a listen.
0688170528|5.0|Jodi Picoult has the knack for character development like no other.<br /><br />She has created individuals in this intense story that you love, hate, but definately care about.  When I finished this story (don't want to give anything away..) I found myself wondering what the characters might be doing now..  That's not an easy task for a writer!  The storyline of a botched double suicide, love, courtroom<br /><br />suspense adds up to nothing but addictive reading!
B00005JNEW|3.0|It definatley was one of the better \\"High School\\" football <br />movies I've seen. The actual football scenes were realisticlly <br />done. The only problem I have with this movie is the sound <br />track. This is a true story about real people and a real <br />football team from Odessa Texas in the year 1988. Now that <br />being said, I heard only one ZZ Top song from that era, but <br />everything else is this modern $#&@ they play today. One scene <br />even shows the star running back listening to a walkman with <br />the type of earphones that did'nt exsist then. And there was <br />alot or \\"Rap/Hiphop\\" type of behavior that really wasn't <br />around at that time. Bottom line, If you are going to make a <br />period piece, make sure everything in the movie is from <br />that period. Don't put jetfighters in a WW1 movie. <br />If they think they need to put this kind of garbage in a movie <br />just to try and attract a younger audience then you should'nt <br />even bother making it. I did'nt hear any 80's music in <br />Remember the Titans. But, if you want to see a good football/ <br />human drama/true story movie, then this is a good one. The <br />documentary in the special features is also excellent. <br />
B00003CXCT|1.0|After waiting several years for a DVD release Star Wars fans are treated to release with loads of technical problems and a poor helping of bonus material. Where were the deleted scenes? The \\"Behind the Magic\\" CD-ROM had more extras. 1 disc of extras for the whole trilogy? The prequels each had a disc for extras.  And then there's the technical problems. Think I'm overreacting? There's a whole forum on the Star Wars website filled with the problems in this set. Be prepared for reveresed audio channels. And let's not forget that the method used to encode these DVDs can't be read perfectly by all DVD players. That's right the movies will skip in specific spots depending on what kind of DVD player you have. (...)
B00064MW6A|4.0|I didn't go see this in theaters because I listened to all the bad reviews.  This film, after all, had as many bad reviews as Swept Away did!  Boy, was I wrong to do so.   <br /> <br />This film was extremely entertaining.  Sure, it has one or two moments of ridicule, but overall it's a film no super-hero fan should miss.  Pitof did a great job of making the film flow smoothly.  The scene transitions are fresh and interesting, the CG effects are used at just the right times and the soundtrack was integrated brilliantly.  This is the first time that Catwoman actually has cat-like behaviour (not just a sexy woman in a tight black outfit). <br /> <br />Halle Berry plays Catwoman very well.  A huge majority of the stunts were done by her, the fighting and whip art is all her and she does it all wonderfully.  The catsuit is a bit unorthodox, but if you just go with it, it's really not that bad.  You could say it's the latest incarnation of Catwoman since she's never been the same from the moment she appeared in Batman comic books.  Another welcome surprise is Sharon Stone.  She looks amazing!  Her acting, I'd say, is up to par with the rest of her stuff (come on, she's never been that great of an actress).  I'd compare it to Basic Instinct.  And it's nice to see her in a villainous role again.  Ben Bratt's character kinda gets in the way.  Nothing too special about him really. <br /> <br />The plot is typical DC comics super-hero film plot.  Rich, powerful people trying to pull off an exaggerated and unrealistic plan in order to be even more rich.  That's how super-hero films always were, so get used to it.  As cheesy as it sounds, it works!  At the end of it all, I found that there wasn't one scene I wasn't interested it.  Whether it's the amazing action sequences, seeing Catwoman scale walls, or just the way a scene looks, everything is done very well. <br /> <br />The only improvement I'd make is to change her name from Patience Phillips back to Selina Kyle.  Otherwise, watch the movie.  Don't expect anything more than a flashy popcorn flick and you'll agree that it's not that bad of a film.  I definitely think it's one of the fall's most underrated movies.
0553573403|5.0|First off, I have never felt so strongly about a fantasy book to write a review.  As many people here can relate, I was becomming tired of the predictable fantasy crap comming out that was just clones of eachother.  But people kept telling me to read this series, but I put it off.  And finally I picked up \\"A Game Of Thrones.\\" Ok, at first, I didn't like the book. With so many names and houses and kingdoms, it was kinda confusing.  It was alot to take in at first, but after maby 100 pages I was hooked and can now say that this is, by far, the best fantasy series I have ever read.  The book is a rare gem and you are truly missing out if you don't read this.  Pick it up, you will NOT be sorry.

The whole setup has an almost improv feel to it, like the actors are just spitting out lines off the top of their head.. and it is HILARIOUS.  Tasteless?  Sure.  And that makes it all the better!  The kind of people who hated this movie probably also hated \\"Team America\\" for being offensive and tasteless.  THAT movie is beyond awesome, but that's a subject for the DVD review.  (...)
B0002XDODU|5.0|Reise Reise is the fourth C.D. by Rammstein, and, in my opinion, one of the best.  I'm shocked at how many people have spoken out against it and it's softer tone.  It just isn't right to say you are a fan of a band unless you can accept that they don't always have to stick to the same genre over and over.  Here's a breakdown of the eleven songs on the disc..<br /><br />1. Reise Reise - (Arise Arise)  Obviously the opener on the C.D, it starts out quite soft and gradually gets louder and breaks into the lyrics.  It may seem like it has a poor melody in the beginning, but it quickly evolves into an amazing middle to end.  It can be compared to the bueaty of Mein Herz Breannt, which was also a song heavily based on it's symphonic like melody.  The song ends with a nice acordian solo and closes perhaps the best opener to all of their soundtracks.<br /><br />5 of 5<br /><br />2. Mein Teil - (My Part) This song starts out rather loud but is slow pacd.  It's very traditional with the industrial style, and it's content reminded me immeadiently of Eifersucht.  Though it took a really long time to grow on me, I now recognize it as one of the best songs on the C.D.<br /><br />4 of 5<br /><br />3. Dalai Lama - A mellow song with a dark theme, a plane that must crash and the passengers (especially a child) feelings as they plunge to their death.  It has an interesting melody and is slow paced.  This is a favorite of mine because of the strange melody.<br /><br />5 of 5<br /><br />4. Keine Lust (Don't Feel Like It)  This song is hard from the beginning and is very much the traditional style of Rammstein.  Though the beginning wasn't so great at first, it soon began to remind me ever so slightly of some of the castlevania music, and once it gets further in the song the melody and the intense beat picks up.  The melody flows well with the rythem of the words as well, making it resemble, to me anyway, Reise Reise.  Definatly one of the best on the soundtrack.<br /><br />5 of 5<br /><br />5. Los - (-less)  Los is a play on the double meaning of word in German depending on where and how they are used.  The song itself is soft but has an interesting rythem.  Though it flows with the lyrics, it isn't such a catchy one.  This doens't make the song bad however.  One of the best.<br /><br />4 of 5<br /><br />6. Amerika - (America)  We're all living in America ... Those are the opening words, sung in english.  The chorus is in english, and the whole song basically talks about how many American cultures are spreading throughout the world, thus the analogy of 'living in america' and having to accept.  It has a fairly repetitive melody accept during the mid-end, where it varies a bit.  Overall good song.<br /><br />4.5 of 5<br /><br />7. Moskau - (Moscow)  I hated this song at first, but it has slowly grown on me.  It is also somewhat dirty in theme, as it refers blatantly to prostitution.  Again, seems like it has no melody at first, but presents itself when Russian and German begin to be sung together.  The two languages actually fit into the song nicely and flow with the melody.  It does get a bit boring towards the end, but again, over all good.<br /><br />4.5 of 5<br /><br />8. Morgenstern - (Morning Star)  Beatiful opening and song in general, has a very.. epic feel to it with the chorus in the back round, I can't exact place what it reminds me of..  maybe cathedral music..  Definatly worth listening to, although like Mein Teil had to grow on me.<br /><br />5 of 5<br /><br />9. Stein um Stein - ( Stone by Stone)  Slow paced and soft, it has a strange opening melody and strange theme of the song in general..  Up to the rephrase very good, and after it very good as well.  I like the theme of sadism, but I would suppose younger people wouldn't.  Good song.<br /><br />4 of 5<br /><br />10. Ohne Dich - (Without You)  Starts out soft and stays soft.  This is a song of remorse, and quite acurately gets it's point across.  It's melody flows perfectly withthe words, which are simple.  Out of all their songs it seems the easiest to understand to a person with basic german knowledge.  It's theme of lost love reminds me of Nebel from Mutter.  I would consider it the best song on the soundtrack.<br /><br />5 of 5<br /><br />11.  Amour - (Love)  The second best song on the soundtrack.  The words may not seem to flow with the amazing melody at first but it slowly merges together to create a beautiful song of the uncontrollableness (...) of love.  The ending is the worst part of the song, completely breaking away from it's soft theme and getting very rockish.  It's just out of place.<br /><br />4.5 of 5<br /><br />As one can see, it definetly has a different style.  I recommend this C.D. for anyone who is a TRUE fan of Rammstein and IS NOT AFRAID OF CHANGE.  However, for all of you who believe Rammstein should only be a bunch of melodylos with lound banging noises and such, DO NOT GET IT.  This is a very un-traditional soundtrack.  It is soft and slow, not loud and Industrial.  Overall it was a nice shift from the normal style, and is the only C.D. besides Mutter that I have found myself to like EVERY SINGLE TRACK ON THE DISC.oss.

Every single note they played is something to be marveled at by humans for all eternity. Listening to their music is a deeply religious experience. It is like spiritual poetry.

0375758992|5.0|Book Report Jan 19, 2005<br /><br />\\"Don't Let's go to the dogs tonight\\" written by Alexandra Fuller.<br /><br />ISBN 0-375-75899-2 Memoir 51395<br /><br />August 2002<br /><br />What a great book!<br /><br />I feel that the Fullers are part of my collection of friends and family, like I spent my summers growing up with them.  Bobo (Alexandra), tells a story the same straightforward way my Aunt Katie would.  This was so real.<br /><br />There are 12 neat questions for discussion at the back of the book (I should have read them first).<br /><br />So, why did the Fullers stay in Africa (in such dangerous surroundings), after such a \\"run of bad luck\\"?  Why did Bobo miss Africa at all and why was she so glad to get back?  How did superstition play a role in their lives?<br /><br />I would add, how were they influenced by the culture.<br /><br />I think it is the adventure, and the excitement.  Everything else is dull and boring by comparison.  At one point, Bobo \\"drank the wrong water\\" and (see page 177 - 179), she is so sick, yet it ends with \\"I make a vow never to leave Africa\\".  I expected her (a child living in an \\"Not Fit For White Man's Habitation, as marked on the map, part of Africa and being so sick), to say just the opposite.  But, she was so glad to be on the mend and appreciative of all the sights and sounds and smells all around her.<br /><br />On page 149 she says \\"In Rhodesia, we are born and then the umbilical cord of each child is sewn straight from the mother onto the ground.  Pulling away from the ground causes death by suffocation, starvation.  That's what the people of this land believe.  Deprive us of the land and you are depriving us of air, water, food, and sex.\\"<br /><br />Notice how this ends with \\"us\\" and not with \\"them\\".  She is the people of \\"this\\" land, and you can feel that all through the book.  So the draw to keep her is the people, all her relationships, the culture, everything else in the environment, and all her memories.  And she has shared those memories so well.<br /><br />Page 22 - 23 shows \\"chapters of life\\", which was a very creative literary device.

B0002858YS|5.0|This is such a great album.  Great music, great guitars, great vocals, and great lyrics.  The first half of the record is packed with hits and hits in waiting.  Very strong indeed, the stand outs for me being \\"Smile Like You Mean it\\" and \\"Things that I've done\\".  The two strongest on the record.   <br /> <br />The second half can be said to be just as strong, but it takes some time to grown on you and discover.  It's funny people keep mentioning their style and who they \\"borrowed\\" from.  It seems only serious Killers fans realize that their biggest influence is U2.  Listen to that sound!! I mean, the band respect u2 so much and their guitarist says his favorite string man is the Edge.  Listen to the guitar solo on \\"On Top\\", that's the Edge. Funny thing is, \\"Hot Puss\\" might just have beaten out \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" as the best album of 2004.     <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|If you go to other reviews in this forum, you will find some very thoughtful, thorough reviews from people comparing this film to its source material, Homer's Iliad.  Such comparisons, while interesting and worthwhile, are really pointless, since Hollywood is notorious for taking perfectly good source material and inexplicably changing pieces of it for the purposes of condensing the story, expediting exposition, or simply focusing on a different aspect of the story than has traditionally been told.  Thus, it was probably good that my memory of reading the Iliad in high school was somewhat fuzzy--it was much better for me to consider the film on its own merits, even if it did depart from Homer's storyline in a few significant respects. <br /> <br />Troy might well have been titled Achilles, for Brad Pitt's character is really the centerpiece of the film.  Pitt brings an earnest, amoral righteousness to Achilles that makes the viewer realize that there is more to Pitt than a pretty face, flowing locks, good muscle tone, and an all-over tan.  Although the screenwriting pushes Achilles' struggles with Agamemmnon and his own conscience to the forefront for much of the film, the rest of the ensemble cast is similarly well-chosen.  Brian Cox is sufficiently egomaniacal as Agamemmnon, Eric Bana (who has totally underwhelmed me with previous performances) actually shows a bit of range in this film as Hector, Sean Bean makes a believable Odysseus, and Peter O'Toole is stately as Priam.  Probably the best commentary on the acting in the film is that each main character comes off as both heroic and yet fatally flawed.  Strangely enough, the face that launched a thousand ships and whose infidelity actually precipitated the Trojan War, plays a relatively minor role in the film, although Kruger (the actress playing Helen) is appropriately beautiful and conflicted in her minor role. <br /> <br />The major improvement over Homer is that, apart from a few statues, temples, and offhanded references, the Greek gods are basically nonexistent in the film, giving the characters a grounding in reality instead of the supernatural.  For the purposes of this film, that is a good thing, as bringing the involvement of the gods into the affairs of men would cloud an already complicated storyline of shaky and sometimes shifting allegiances. <br /> <br />The battle sequences are generally magnificently done, particularly where Achilles is involved, and although much blood is spilled, few scenes seem gratuitous or pointless.   There is purpose in these battles--the Greeks are empire building and the Trojans are protecting their homeland.  And when Achilles joins the fray, look out.   His battle sequences are sufficiently entertaining to keep the viewer fully engaged and mesmerized, yet are understated enough to leave the viewer wanting more. <br /> <br />The film's pacing is also better than most movies that exceed two hours--I rarely found myself clock watching.   Petersen's directing is also generally good, although even a relatively untrained eye like mine noted some awkward cuts and angles. <br /> <br />After watching some recent disappointments passing themselves off as epics (see my review of King Arthur, for example), Troy was a breath of fresh air.  Homer it's not, but I didn't rent it expecting a strict interpretation.  The film does what it sets out to do, and does so in an entertaining manner, and that's all I was hoping for.  Watch the film and enjoy the performances, just don't confuse it with the Iliad.
B00064MW6K|1.0|This movie was so bad when i first watched it not only was i in and torture state i really did feal sorry for Halle Berry and whoever helped make this movie. Based around the superhero genre made this movie ever so worse not only is the action crap because all she does is run up and down walls to get away from bullets half the story is based around her hooking up with some cop.<br /><br />The animation put in the movie was quite low in quality compared to what they are able to do today, the original superhero thing where it shows a scene with him/her jumping, flying or swinging from building to building is added but with that extra touch of crapness, they show the scene at the worst possible times its soposed to get you into the movie a bit more but it looked to me like it was lessened by the scene.<br /><br />The whole movie is supposed to build up to a final showdown and the one to beat is some super model who has hardened her skin with a new cosmetic cream which catwoman is trying to stop from being released, and she can't even fight back it just shows catwoman kicking the crap out of some defenseless woman who can't be hurt she does however manage to get a pole to hit catwoman with.<br /><br />The movies originality is at the absolute minimum and there is not one thing well done about it, whoo save us catwoman from the cream lol ne ways im not gonna stop you from seing the movie for urself, enjoy.
B000002MUW|5.0|This was a slight improvement from Erotica. Still not the best but a lil better than Erotica. This was supposed to be her comeback album. But it sold the same amount of copies as Erotica did. 2 million copies. Bedtime Stories sold a lil faster though.  <br /> <br />Survival 8/10 Not the best opener. Sounds like a filler. <br /> <br />Secret 10/10 1st single. This is a memorable song. <br /> <br />I'd Rather Be Your Lover 4/10 I never fell for this song. <br /> <br />Don't Stop 5/10 Sounds like another filler. <br /> <br />Inside of Me 7/10 Nice ballad. Not my favorite though. <br /> <br />Human Nature 10/10 4th single. This has a addictive beat. <br /> <br />Forbidden Love 10/10 My favorite ballad on this cd. This was gonna be the 5th single. <br /> <br />Love Tried To Welcome Me  5/10 I never paid this song much attention. <br /> <br />Sanctuary 10/10 I always loved this song. The melody is awesome. <br /> <br />Bedtime Stories 10/10 3rd single. This song doesn't really fit on the album but its still my favorite on here. <br /> <br />Take a Bow 10/10 2nd single. This is a great album closer. This song introduced me to Madonna way back.           <br /> <br /> <br />I would give this album a 8/10 for an overall rating. I gave Erotica a 7/10.
B00064MW6K|5.0|I loved this DVD, it didn't contain as much violence as most movies do, I imagine that is probably why it did't do so well in the box office, to me sometimes, it seems society wants more and more violence in movies. As far as the catwoman outfit Halle wore, I really didn't see anything wrong with it, it really covered more than most of the swimsuits do today. I found the movie very good and action packed, I believe the PG-13 rating fit it well.  It is very gripping, and I did some research on the movie and there really was an Egytian goddess cat named Bastet, so it did contain some historical element, the special effects were very good, it would be nice to move the way the special effects had her moving as catwoman, very catlike, especially if you watch cats and the way they move. It is one movie I will watch over and over again. I have yet to check out the extra's contained on the DVD, I am so intrigued by the movie itself. According to the DVD package it contains an alternate ending, additional scenes, and profiles the evolution of the character, I look forward to viewing these as soon as I have the time and can move past the movie itself. Once again very good movie.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Green day clearly had a plan for this album... But when they got all the good tracks stolen they just put in all the tracks that didn't make the album... I sort of enjoyed the slower songs, but not really... compared to their earlier albums, like Dookie, this album is absolutely terrible.
0312330529|5.0|Certainly one of the best books I have ever read.  I have never been to India, however I feel I grew up there.  Real or not real, that is part of the mystery and charm of this huge book. <br /> <br />I am fortunate to have a signed first Australian edition (where it was first published) which I am certain will do nothing but grow in value over the next few years. <br /> <br />I have also heard that a movie is being made for release next year.  We can only hope.
B00026WU4G|4.0|With a sound reminiscent of a Jamacian Bar Band (albeit, with several rock all-stars including Mark Knopfler and Mick Taylor), Dylan dropped this plaintative collection of Caribbean tinged rock n' roll tunes.  The sound here is near-contemporary, yet with a defiant strut and precocious attitude that marks the music as trademark Dylan.  While many celebrated this as a return to secular songwriting, there was still plenty of journeyman lyrics and biblical dabbling involved to keep this from being a neutral affair.  The suberb \\"Jokerman\\" talks fervently of false prophets, martyrs, and Sodom and Gomorrah.  Suprisingly, that song is arguably one of the best and most engaging works in his storied arsenal.  Meanwhile \\"Man of Peace\\" warns that sometimes \\"Satan comes as a man of peace,\\" proving that Dylan was more than game to explore holy themes.  However, it's unfair to focus primarily on the intellectualizing when there's a fair share of hip shaking boogie to go around on \\"Neighborhood Bully\\" and \\"Union Sundown.\\"  The latter track, like much of the album, makes forays into political and social commentary that re-visit Dylan's musical muckraking days.   Although this album is no BLOOD ON THE TRACKS or BLONDE ON BLONDE in terms of its prominence, INFIDELS still stands out as a highlight amongst the Dylan catalog and is easily one of his most underrated efforts.
B0006GAI6Y|2.0|I'd actually give this one 2 1/2 stars, because there were a lot of enjoyable parts to this film; plenty of laughs and good dancing scenes.  Predictable plot, bad acting, cheesy script, and cheesier music make it not so good.  Jennifer Lopez might as well have been a cardboard cutout for how much personality she shows in the movie.  What happened to the girl we fell in love with in The Wedding Planner??!!!  Aside from one scene of great dancing and a few other likable dances she spends the rest of the movie trying too hard to look sad.  Way too many shots of her staring out windows looking calculatedly pathetic.  Is she supposed to be tragic and mysterious??  I'm not sure.  The supporting characters are what make this movie worthwhile, not the two big stars, I've never cared much for Richard Gere anyway.
B0002IRY0O|4.0|This set is a mixed bag. It contains Celibidache's live Bruckner recordings with SWR Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra (symphonies 3,5,7, 8 and 9) and Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra (the 4th). As is well known, Celi hated studio recordings.<br /><br />Celi was a great Bruckner conductor, no doubt about that, although he earned this reputation late in his career. But it is indeed painful to hear his karaoke behavior: Celi yells often loudly while conducting, frequently just before a climax, sometimes even with more lungpower than the brass, it seems. Worse than having a coughing audience, I think! This is especially the case in the third symphony, but his characteristic shouts are audible elsewhere too. But don't get me wrong: the interpretations are very fine. And the third, fourth and seventh are among the best available.<br /><br />Thus these recordings are welcome additions to the Bruckner catalogue. Comparing this bargain DG collector's edition set with the very expensive EMI set, where Celi is conducting Munich Philharmonic, the speeds are swifter. This is especially the case with the eight symphony, which Celi takes extremely slow in Munich. Here are the differences for each movement:<br /><br />EMI: 20'56 ; 16'05 ; 35'04 ; 32'08<br /><br />DG : 16'16 ; 13'52 ; 27'08 ; 26'04<br /><br />I think the earlier DG account in the present set is preferable. The Munich take is too slow, even if the attention to detail is remarkable. Similar judgements are applicable for the rest of the set as well, though the time differences are less dramatic. For example, the account of the fourth is ten minutes faster here. Comparing with Jochum, however, all Celi's speeds are very slow throughout the whole set.<br /><br />SWR Stuttgart Radio Symphony Orchestra and Swedish Radio Symphony Orchestra are not famous for their Bruckner playing. In this respect, they do not outshine, say, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra, Staatskapelle Dresden, and Concertgebouw. But minor orchestras can surprise with a good conductor, as they do here.<br /><br />Sound is good but not in upper demonstration class.o here.    Sound is good but not in upper demonstration class.
B0006399FS|3.0|ATYCLB was much better.  There are about 3 songs on this one that stand out.  Other than that, a very safe, listener friendly album that doesn't push any boundaries.
B00008DDSC|5.0|I have seen this movie over 15 times since its release. I just hope hollywood makes this type of movie. This movie shows its originalty. James Spader is huge now after this flick. Making tv shows and other independent films. Maggie G. is a good actress. A must see!
B0006399FS|5.0|This is one of U2's finest albums.  Every song has been meticulously crafted by a band that sounds like it's 20 years younger.  The people giving this album poor reviews mostly a) don't like Bono, or b) don't know much about music.  Have you really listened to anything on the radio?  Vertigo, All Because of You - these songs are played on mainstream radio but sound nothing like anything on mainstream radio today or ever.  Ever wonder why not many people can cover U2 songs?  It's because it's nearly impossible to sound even close to as good.  Bob Dylan said it himself: \\"Your songs are great, but no one's going to be able to play them.\\"  This coming from the man who wrote All Along the Watchtower, which was probably covered most famously and finely by Jimi Hendrix.  The rest of the album is very nearly brilliant, with not a dud in sight.  The best song is Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, with Bono's heartfelt vocals and Edge's simple-yet-effective jangling guitar.  It's their best song since One.  I don't know what people are thinking when they give this album a bad review.  Just because you hate U2 or think they should be retired doesn't give you any right to troll around Amazon and crap on their new album.  Show me a better collection of songs this year.  I doubt you could.  And no way in hell is U2 overrated.  The Joshua Tree is, if not the greatest, in the top 5 greatest albums ever conceived.  And when you can make an album like How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb 17 years after you became the biggest band in the world, you know that you've got something special.  Name another band that has stayed on top for so long.  Critics like them because they can still make brilliant music, not because they're aging hipsters.  Trollers, find something better to do with your lives.  Maybe learning a bit about music would do you some good.  It certainly couldn't hurt.
B0006284JQ|5.0|This has to be one of the best greatest hit cd I heard so far. Britney delivers the hits it will take you back to when she started up until her lastest single. Wow is all I have to say plus the two new songs are wonderful. Thank you Britney.
B000059HB7|5.0|If I could only have one John Wayne western, I would choose Rio Bravo.<br /><br />It is casual yet filled with the best of the best of the American Western. This one even has classic cowboy comedy (Walter Brennan is poignant and hilarious) and cowboy music (Ricky Nelson and Dean Martin sing a duet!). But mostly, it is a tale in the classic western genre about courage, integrity, and stout-heartedness of Americans; especially the pioneers.<br /><br />Against all the odds, the good guys make their stand but it's not all fun and games for our friends! A terrific film and tribute to the larger-than-life legend of John Wayne.
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I enjoy going back in time with Shania I glad she put out this cd. For anyone who has been their since day one this one is for you.
0783225849|5.0|This film is a great masterpiece of filmmaking!  Perfect in every sense.  It is Anthony Perkin's masterpiece as well....no other character in film history makes you cringe yet feel sorry for at the same time.  It takes a special talent to do that and why he didn't get nominated for the Oscar much less win will never be understood!!  Just as Vivien Leigh will always be Scarlett O'Hara, Judy Garland will always be Dorothy, Anthony Perkins will always be Norman Bates.<br /><br />The rest of the cast is outstanding as well...notably Janet Leigh as the doomed Marion Crane.  She deserved her Oscar nomination for her performance.<br /><br />The DVD is loaded with a dandy of an extra \\"The Making of Psycho\\" plus additional trailers and bonus materials that make this edition well worth owning.  Even without the extras though, this film would still be a masterpiece thanks to Hitchock, Stefano's screenplay, and Perkins' unparalleled acting!
B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is the best comedy to come out since Dumb and Dumber.  Became one of my all time favorites after the first time I saw it, which is saying something because I wasn't expecting much from it at all.
B000084T18|5.0|I loved this album!!!!  After hearing the whole album, I knew that we had a rap superstar in our future.  I got this when it came out (maybe day, week, month, got it a long time ago).  Every song is hot as hell and is worth listening to.  The guest appearances were great too, and great at the point that 50 himself was not outshined.   <br /> <br />1. Intro - Just a coin dropping and gun shots (no rating) <br /> <br />2. What's Up Gangsta - 10/10 - I loved this song.  Great intro track for the album <br /> <br />3. Patiently Waiting (featuring Eminem) - 10/10 - Great song.  Eminem produced this and him and 50 dropped some hot verses.  Would like to see another collabo involving only those two <br /> <br />4. Many Men - 15/10 - HOT SONG!!!  One of my favorites on this whole album  <br /> <br />5. In Da Club - 8/10 - Second single (not the first, Wanksta was the first) from this album; way overplayed but still an overly decent song <br /> <br />6. High All The Time - 9/10 - Song about getting high <br /> <br />7. Heat - 10/10 - I love this song!! This is taken out of the non-dirty album. <br /> <br />8. If I Can't - 9/10 - Creatively lyrical, but gets repetitive <br /> <br />9. Back Down - 100/10 (this is not a typo) - Disses Ja Rule; I love this song and can relate to it because I hate JA also.   <br /> <br />10. Blood Hound (featuring Young Buck) - 9.5/10 - My first introduction to Young Buck.  I thought that he spit some hotter rhymes here than on Beg For Mercy, his solo album, and on Petey Pablo's \\"Still Writing In My Diary: 2nd Entry\\" (appears on a song called \\"O it's On) <br /> <br />11. P.I.M.P. - 8/10 - The fourth single from the album.  The TV version is better than the regular one and has eventually reached the overplayed level <br /> <br />12. Like My Style (featuring Tony Yayo) - 9/10 - not a great introduction to Yayo, but 50 still keeps the song hot  <br /> <br />13. Poor Lil Rich - 10/10 - Great song; talks about being poor and then later being the hottest man around and now they can't even talk about him <br /> <br />14. 21 Questions (featuring Nate Dogg) - 9/10 - Third single.  This was my favorite song before they released it as a single.  Almost any song w/ Nate Dogg is hot, and there are too many albums to name that he is on <br /> <br />15. Don't Push Me (featuring Lloyd Banks and Eminem) - 10/10 - Intro to Lloyd Banks.  Probably the greatest G-Unit intro on this album (other than 50, of course).  All threee men drop some blazin lyrics. <br /> <br />16. Gotta Make It To Heaven - 9/10 - Talks about asking God for forgiveness and that he has to be in Heaven and doesn't want to end up in Hell, even though he has done bad things <br /> <br />17. Wanksta - 10/10 - first single off this album and the second from the 8 Mile soundtrack, this was big in 2002 before the 2003 release of his debut album, and I still love this song. <br /> <br />18. U Not Like Me - 10/10 - talking about how everybody is like him, and responding that he is way different. <br /> <br />19. Life's on the Line - 9/10 - Last song on this album.  After this song ended, I soon played the whole album again.  Anybody notice that this song and Poor Lil Rich have the same starting lyrics?  \\"I let my watch talk for me, my whip for me, my gat for me, BOW!, what's up homey?\\"
B00006879E|4.0|Maroon5 (Adam Lavine in particular) have become one of my favorite bands. Their sound is so catchy and unique, and their material is genuine, unlike to many other artists of today.  <br />The following is my track-to-track analysis: <br /> <br />1. Harder to Breathe 4/5 Upbeat and catchy, but not my favorite <br />2. This Love 4/5 Wouldn't be my choice for a single, but good <br />3. Shiver 4.5/5 One of my favorite tracks <br />4. She Will Be Loved 4.5/5 Almost perfect - another favorite  <br />5. Tangled 4.5/5 Almost \\"cookie-cutter\\" - but excellent <br />6. The Sun 4.5/5 A really fun and different song  <br />7. Must Get Out 4.5/5 Another awesome track  <br />8. Sunday Morning 4.5/5 The hits just keep on coming! <br />9. Secret 4/5 Sort-of a filler sounding track  <br />10. Through With You 4/5 Same as above <br />11. Not Coming Home (Live)4.5/5 The unique beat makes this song perfect   <br />12. Sweetest Goodbye 4.5/5 The perfect way to close a great album!  <br /> <br />I definately reccomend SONGS ABOUT JANE by Maroon 5, in addition to Blue Skies by Diana DeGarmo.
B00005JKJA|1.0|Here's my only point of a review on this movie:  Can anyone honestly tell me what this film was about? <br /> <br />That's all.
B000002MJC|5.0|This is unquestionably DM's best album.  As is often the case with an artist's best work, it is also their most misunderstood album.  I can't recall how many long-time DM fans I've heard say that they didn't really care for anything after Violator.  What a pity!  Perhaps it is because this is Depeche Mode's most organic sounding album, with more guitar, live vocals, and live orchestral movements, than any other album.  I suppose many DM fans prefer more purely synthetic music.  Perhaps it's because this is DM's most soulful album ever, with Martin Gore's most profound lyrics to date, and Dave Gahan's most raw and emotional vocal performances ever.  Perhaps it's just a little too deep for those who prefer to stay in the shallower waters of Depeche Mode's pop days.    One reviewer said that DM caved to the pressure to make a rock album.  This is completely ridiculous.  I'm guessing this \\"fan\\" isn't aware that the band's main songwriter, Martin Gore, started out playing blues and rock on an acoustic guitar, long before he ever played piano or picked up a keyboard.  None of DM's fans were clamoring for a rock album.  In fact, I would suggest that after fans failed to \\"get\\" this album, DM caved to FAN pressure and went back to doing more synthetic music.    Something that no one else seems to have understood is that this is a `concept' album.  That's what's so TOTALLY AMAZING about this album, is how PROFOUND these lyrics are.  This entire album is filled with phenomenal songs that compare the relationship between a man and a woman, to the relationship between man and God.  Thus the title, Songs of FAITH and DEVOTION.  That's also the reason for the gospel choir on many songs.  If you never thought of the spiritual/religious connotations of these songs, go back and listen to them again, only this time imagine that Dave is singing to GOD, or that he is singing as if he is the voice of GOD talking to us, as in \\"Get Right With Me\\".  Then listen to the album once more, imagining Dave singing to his lover and friends.  Of course, with some songs, like the brilliant \\"Walking in My Shoes\\", or the powerful \\"Condemnation\\", Dave is railing against all of those who would judge him and damn him to hell for his sins.  I can SO easily relate.    From beginning to end, every song on this album is amazing in it's profound lyrical depth, intense vocal performances, and incredibly intricate layers of musical textures and colours.  Perhaps my favorites would be \\"Mercy In You\\", and \\"In Your Room\\".  The guy who didn't get that song is clearly a fool, and not only for getting the title wrong.  It's a song about emotional dependency:  \\"I'm hanging on your words, living on your breath, feeling with your skin, will I always be here?\\"  But it's also about the need for forgiveness: \\"In your room, your burning eyes cause flames to arise.  Will you let the fire die down soon?  Or will I always be here?\\"  Again, this may be a little too deep for those in the kiddy pool.  There is a darkness to the music of these songs, that envelops the listener, like a blanket - like the \\"comfort of being sad\\".  If you've ever hurt someone that you loved because you made mistakes, this is the album for you, and especially these two songs.    As a songwriter, I am in awe of this album.  This is one of those that I can put in when I get too impressed by my own talent and need my ego knocked down a notch or two.  When I listen to these songs, I quickly realize that I'm not THERE yet.  This album defines \\"Genius\\", when it comes to songwriting.
B0002GTWYW|5.0|This is one of very, very few CD's in which I can pop in my CD player, and let play for the entire legnth of it. The Intro sets the mood, that this isn't some fake album. By the time you get to Gimme The Loot and Machine Gun Funk, you realize how great of an MC Bigs actually was. I wasn't a huge Biggie fan until I picked this album up. <br /> <br />That being said, the Remaster is definately worth it, IF you don't already have the original. The DVD is nice, but to be honest, I've never really watched it all that much. It's the two extra songs, Who Shot Ya and Just Playing (Dreams), that really make the Remaster worth it. <br /> <br />Album Top 5: <br /> <br />1. Suicidal Thoughts <br />2. Just Playing (Dreams) <br />3. Unbelievable <br />4. Gimme the Loot <br />5. Juicy
0393317552|5.0|Jared Diamond is the most fascinating public intellectual out there, even though he comes from disciplines that I as an arrogant physicist never regarded as remotely interesting, such as botany or geography.  I'd much rather attend a lecture by Diamond than, say Steven Hawking or Edward Witten. <br /> <br />What he does in this landmark book is weave together knowledge from a diverse set of seemingly unrelated disciplines, and form a lucid and scientifically compelling thesis as to why civilizations arising on the Eurasian landmass got a crucial early developmental leg up on those in Africa, the Americas or Australia. <br /> <br />To think that the fate of civilizations would depend on things as mundane as the types of native grains available and diseases incubated in domestic animals was to me quite revelatory and to others, apparently quite disturbing, as evidenced by the number of nitpicking and irrational negative reviews this book has attracted.  I guess for some people it's more important to feel they are special than to learn something about how the world works. <br /> <br />Diamond's analysis does become somewhat less compelling when he attempts to explain comparative differences in more advanced societies (i.e. China vs. Europe), though it's still worth reading. <br /> <br />In other words, I liked this book.
B00000IAU3|5.0|Dido's debut is truly something great. You couldn't ask for a better start from a new artist. All of the songs are this album are remarkable. this cd is so powerful, the songs are almost calming and empowering. A MUST HAVE!<br /><br />1)Here with me - I love this song. Very powerful. (10/10)<br /><br />2)Hunter - Another great song. Great lyrics, music, melodies, everything. (10/10)<br /><br />3)Don't think of me - A nice tune. (9/10)<br /><br />4)My lover's gone - Absolutely love this song. It's slow but has a great beat, and is so calming. (10/10)<br /><br />5)All you want -  Once again a great, powerful song. (9.5/10)<br /><br />6)Thank you - popular song. It's a great song, even though its been played so much. (10/10)<br /><br />7) Honestly OK - I also love this song.

(10/10)<br /><br />10)I'm no angel - Excellent Song!!!! (10/10)<br /><br />11) My life - slowest song. (8.5/10)<br /><br />12) take my hand - love the melody and chorus! (10/10)
0316172324|3.0|I will start by saying that this book does make some interesting points about using our current understanding of the brain and human reactions under stress within institutional frameworks in ways that MIGHT help make a better society. It even may inspire a few people to be more conscious and alert to their surroundings. But an epiphany or cure-all pill for humanity it is not. If you're looking for personal realization you might try meditating for few years. Much of the personal aspect of this book can be had from far more ancient wisdom that doesn't cost $18. I should say that there are some interesting bits of information and the reading is easy so the fluff doesn't seem so bad, but Gladwell stretches his arguments pretty thin and comes to some dubious conclusions. In many ways this book lulls you into thinking that it might actually have something to say and in the end all you really have are a few more trivia facts on modern psychology and neuroscience and few opinions about why some musicians are overlooked, some police make mistakes and some museums dupe themseleves into buying counterfeits. For me it was an easy read that I didn't have to think about too much about that got me through a very very long excursion in todays world of US airports. Take what you will from this.
B000005ALN|4.0|<br />This album by G. M. is different than his others. It;s filled with slow, jazzy sounds. More mature in a way. Even though there are a lot of slow songs here, and I'm not crazy about all of them, there are some which are just excellent, and so makes up for the other songs. <br /> <br /> <br />1) Jesus To a Child =  a slow, but beautiful song. Really beautiful (4/5) <br />2)Fastlove = A great dance song. One of my favorites by George M. It's upbeat, sexy and just great! (5/5) <br />3)Older = another slow song, jazzy. (3.5/5) <br />4)Spinning the Wheel = A mellow song. Nice flow to it. Not bad (3.5/5) <br />5)It doesn't really matter = Another mellow song. Kinda repetitive. Okay a lot!! Not my favorite (2/5) <br />6) The Strangest thing = pretty song (4/5) <br />7)To be forgiven = slow, nice song 3.5/5) <br />8) move on = a little different, jazzy (4/5) <br />9) Star people = faster pace, not too funky but nice (4/5) <br />10) You have been loved = kinda like jesus to a child (4/5) <br />11) Free = no lyrics (4/5)
B000002MIF|4.0|This album is probably one of the best Smiths albums out there.. <br />Despite the rather irritating 'William it was really nothing' to begin with, the bbc version of 'what difference does it make' really gets into the swing of things..I happen to love this version, maybe because of the different introduction..so you can imagine I was overjoyed when I heard this Charming Man! Buy the album merely for that..it wouldn't be my favourite song overall but certainly did put a smile on my face to hear it.  <br />Others songs that really grabbed my attention were 'Still Ill' and the haunting 'This Night Has Opened My Eyes'.. <br />Another gem on this album is the fabulous 'Girl Afraid'..and inevitably the next 3 songs that proceed it. It wasn't that I disliked the other songs on this album,but I felt the songs I mentioned were outstanding. So this album is truly.. <br />Amazing..
B00006LIRI|4.0|I really like the collection of songs on this U2 classics album. All of their most popular stuff is here, plus a second cd with remixes and b-sides. A beautuful cd (cds)!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />
B000069AUI|4.0|This album contains songs that ranks in the excellence level, incredible melodies, perfect accompaniments, a good voice, overall great compositions that make PERFECT pop songs. This is how all POP should sound. But there are another songs that sounds to me dull, repetitive, boring, with no deepness nor catchiness at all. Just boring and \\"filler stuff\\". I wouldnt have included those songs and would have just made an EP. Of course, as everybody knows that is not a commercial vialible option so they made and album but and album with half excellent (not just good) songs and half completely forgettable songs.

0670033375|4.0|Last year Martin Rees published a work on the possible threats to mankind from human and non- human causes. It is a virtual dictionary of possible disaster. Rees an astronomer of great distinction considers each possibility with great care for the evidence that has been presented. His list of possible disasters makes this present work seem very tame indeed. Diamond's presentation here of the threat of ' enviromental irresponsibility' takes societies far from the center of things and shows how environmental causes, how failing to accurately read the danger led to their collapse. His marshalling of evidence is impressive and the case- histories are convincing especially to one like myself who knows next to nothing about the societies in question. Yet as a warning for Mankind as a whole it seems to me that in the age of global terrorism, nuclear proliferation, and the radical fundamentalist Islamic crusade he may be very mistaken in urging that the US turn inward focusing primarily on environmental issues. Collapse may come as Diamond rightly points out from a misreading of the basic threat and danger. It seems to me that those dangers in immediate terms today are primarily in the political and military sphere and that however real environmental problems are they are not the first threat.
0385510454|3.0|I'm a huge Grisham fan but this one wasn't up to par with his other books. It was just \\"okay\\". The plot didn't have much substance to it and was lacking suspence. I don't see this one being made into a movie. I still enjoyed Grisham's style of writing which didn't change but there just wasn't much to the story.

068987474X|3.0|I couldn't put this book down. These two authors talk about what to look out for in a relationship on the man's part. WHat he says or does usually means something else. Tons of women write letters telling Greg or Liz about there men and what they should do. Greg always had soemthing to say. I think a lot of these women are dumb for thinking they should stay with a guy after he has cheated and abused them. I recommend this book to anybody in a relationship or not becuase it shows you flaws and problems in a relationship.
B000286S8S|5.0|To begin this review I'd like to correct the misconception about the \\"fade-out glitch\\" on the track \\"Finish What Ya Started\\" that other reviewers have discussed where the song just seems to cut off in the middle of a note. First of all, it's not a fade-out glitch. The song ends exactly the same way on the original album. The ending plays off the title. Think about it, \\"Finish What Ya Started\\". The song doesn't finish. Okay the play on words isn't that witty, but hey, Van Halen was a rock band, not a comedy troupe. Moving on . . . <br /> <br />This is the second Van Halen greatest hits collection to be released. The first, Best of VH Vol. 1, was released 8 years ago and a a complementing Best of Vol. 2 never came out, much to angst of many fans. For those who did not buy that record though, no worries. Releasing a two disc set is cheaper than purchasing two seperate CDs and makes for a more comprehensive collection. Those are some of the pros of this package. I'd highly recommend this for the casual fan. It's very solid. Diehards may also want it because of the three new Hagar tracks, which are pretty good cuts in my opinion.  <br /> <br />However many customers (including myself) have a myriad of complaints about this package. First off, why weren't the songs put in chronological order? The utter randomness of the songs is a big turnoff. Like other reviews have suggested, there should have been one disc for the David Lee Roth era and then another for Hagar instead of this jumble. Another contention are the three live tracks. Why are these here? They just waste disc space. I know they were intended to  give more variation to the collection, but did it ever cross the producers' minds that they could've released a live VH album instead? For those who buy on iTunes and other online music stores, I'd recommend replacing those three tracks with \\"Ice Cream Man\\", \\"Hot Legs\\", and \\"Mean Street\\".
B0006399FS|4.0|Cuando recien supe que los U2 se reunian para forjar lo que hoy es el \\"How to dismantle..\\" supuse que tendria toda la carga del rock que esta de moda en la actualidad. Si, ese rock a lo Franz Ferdinand o Mother Mouse, pues si seguimos la evolucion de los discos del U2 noventero siempre vemos que ellos intentan, sin dejar de perder su estilo y originalidad, estar dentro de la vanguardia del rock del momento. Al escuchar Vertigo me di cuenta que no me equivoque. Una cancion de rock con bastante ritmo y guitarras crudas, bajos tactiles y una percusion marcando el paso. Y porsupuesto Bono, inimitable. Sin embargo, al escuchar el disco completo me doy con la sorpresa que Vertigo es un bicho raro en todo este nuevo meollo.  Las demas canciones nos remiten a los mas clasico de U2, las canciones de albumes como War o hasta incluso de un \\"All that you can't...\\" sin la presencia de Eno y Lanois que siempre tienden a dar un aire atmosferico a las canciones de los irlandeses, y que mas bien deciden optar por seguir la linea de su predecesor que buscar innovaciones. Sin embargo, esto que podria ser una critica a un principio marcado por los mismos U2, la evolucion musical, es recibido por mi de muy grata manera. Con \\"How to dismantle...\\" podemos escuchar a U2 sonando como U2 y mas bien apreciar lo influyentes que son estos tipos en la nueva generacion de rockeros, tanto britanicos como americanos. Pareciera que despues de tanta mutacion, que en ningun momento dejo de ser mala (ni siquiera el bapuleado \\"Pop\\"), los U2 comprendieron que lo unico que le interesa al mundo es que sean ellos, que sean U2. Bomba desmantelada. Trabajo hecho.

B000002GYR|5.0|This is an extraordinaly under-rated record in my opinion. It is definitly in my top 5 favourites of all time and I have a huge, huge record collection and broad music taste. I have never heard a better song than Ol' 55 and I'm not exaggerating. It is a marvellous, beautiful song. Closing Time is a very evocative album. Martha and I Hope That I Don't Fall In Love With You are legendary tracks. Virginia Avenue and Ice Cream Man are classic bluesy jazz-bar tunes. On Waits VHI Storytellers performance he played Ol' 55 in his big Louis Armstrong-style growl which signifies the song still has meaning for him as he rarely, if not ever, plays material from this period of his career anymore. Waits is a genius who posseses a fantastic imagination and an eccentric personality that always shines through in his music, whether it be his lyrics or the music that always fits them perfectly. He is a true bohemian, not a pretentious wannabe who will disguise his horrible song-writing skills as 'art'. One of the most unique individuals in the history of music, there is only one Tom Waits and that's all there ever was or will be.
0446608955|5.0|I absolutely adored this book and for all those romantic book reading poeple out there this is the book for you. Since i like to read romantic novels but absolutely hate sex scenes it was hard to find a good book to read, so when i found this book i absolutely loved it. This book is definitely one of my all time favorites. It captured me from start to end and didn't loose me once. My mother always told me i was a picky reader because if a book did not capture my interest from the beginning i would have difficulty finishing it or just stop reading all together however i did not have a problem with this book. This book was very well written and i hope that Nicolas Sparks keeps up the good work.
B00005JMAH|3.0|It was a good movie.  It's not the best of the three so far.  The \\"kids\\" are getting older and that kinda takes the novelty of them being kids out.  They really should stop here.  But, age aside, this one didn't have as many curious creatures as the previous two had.  It was a decent movie, just nothing interesting like the previous two.  I wish I would've seen it before I bought it.
B00005JMXX|2.0|My wife and I have developed a new set of criteria about deciding when to go to the movies or not -- it's not about whether a movie is good or not, but whether it is a spectacle or not.  Basically, drama and emotions can show up just as well on a TV as they can on a big screen, but explosions and huge waves and large continents look much better when seen on a 60 foot screen.   <br /> <br />So we went to see the Day After Tomorrow at the movie theater, and it didn't disappoint in that regard.  Seeing New York get its just desserts is always entertaining to non-New Yorkers, but some of this spectacle may be lost on the small screen, while none of the implausibility, trite dialogue, predictable action, or preachiness goes away. <br /> <br />This is good for a one-time viewing for the sheer spectacle, but about a third of a way into it, stop the DVD for a second, and predict what will happen to each of the characters.  If you've ever seen any disaster film before, you should be able to guess the rest of the plot with 100% accuracy.  You could have some fun by turning this predictability into a drinking game.  This will add significantly to your viewing pleasure and to the entertainment value of the DVD. <br /> <br />
B0002S947K|5.0|Wow. This is a fantastic album. Warm and full, thoroughly satisfying. Dont quite know what to compare it to, some sounds like Al Kooper produced by Daniel Lanois....

B00020HEL6|5.0|I'm completely blown away by her.  I played this album at work...big mistake.  I didn't get any work done because I was constantly interrupted with \\"Who is that?!\\"  Then when they see the album cover and pictures from her website, \\"That's who's singing?  No way!\\"  David Foster has found a real gem.  In her previous recording, \\"By Request\\", even my untrained ears can hear the potential.  But Foster has helped polish her a lot on this album.  Simply amazing.

B00005JLEU|5.0|When i first watched this film i was absolutely blown away. The Music, the animation, the acting and the storyline are all top-notch and all add to the perfection of this film. Seriously, this film is perfect in every sense of the word and, i absolutely love it. Spirited away will enchant anybody who watches it no matter how old they are. I even managed to get my 45 year old dad to watch it and, no joke, he thought it was amazing.    This is the highest grossing film ever in Japan and one of the highest grossing animated films in the world, which goes to show how fantastic this film is. I watched this film a total of 5 times in the first week I bought it and, it is very rare for me to watch any film twice, never mind five times in one week. Another point to make is the fact that the dubbing on this film is great. The script was slightly changed for the English version so that the words fit into the japanese speaking mouths of the characters. They really hit the nail on the head with this film and if there was one animated film i had advice anybody to get, it would be this one.
B00026WU7I|5.0|Dylan fans who know every nuance may be more qualified than I to report on the quality of a Dylan remaster. My review will place emphasis on the sound, so maybe someone else can comment on the editing.<br /><br />In my opinion, this reissue replaces one of the most abominable CDs ever to occupy the Sony/Dylan catalog. Other favorites like Blonde on Blonde, Highway 51, and JW Harding sounded pretty good in a relative way, but the previous incarnation of BOTT had such dismal sound it was almost unlistenable - whenever I heard it I got a headache.<br /><br />So the new BOTT has a lot in its favor before the first listen, but actually hearing it is really a pleasure again for the first time since vinyl. For a recording of this significance, its been a long time coming.<br /><br />I wouldn't say this is Dylan's greatest album, but I wouldn't say it isn't. Dylan had released a few clunkers before shocking everybody with the amazing coherence, narrative power, and universal relevance of Blood on the Tracks. Like Dylan's best albums, listening is like touring a gallery or watching a play as it goes from one dramatic scene to another. Dylan's migrant American romances consistently connect with the listener and draw more than ever from experience - where he might have been brilliant and condescending as a younger man, he now expresses pain, remorse and the need for love and forgiveness.
B00006IUL7|5.0|This is an excellent police thriller that takes place in small-town Alaska.  Pacino and his partner are packed off to Alaska by the LAPD's internal affairs department; the exact reason why is unknown for most of the movie yet lurks subtly under the surface.  As the plot progresses, characters (mainly Pacino) have to make difficult decisions, and it is those decisions that are behind the movie's remarkable tension.  In the end, this is not a cat-and-mouse chase, and it's not a murder mystery.  It's a thriller about ethics and the crossing of ethical lines - when is it OK to break the rules?  And what rules can be broken?  The acting is top-notch, especially by the three leads, and the editing + cinematography are great.  \\"Insomnia\\" makes you think as it entertains.  Highly recommended.
B00006SFLV|5.0|this is an amazing show.  it was critically acclaimed and rightfully so.  it's great because it's honest and has real feeling. the subject matter is interesting and unlike anything else on television.  i crave shows that are real... i'm not talking about reality television, because that's not real.  this is one of the smartest and most entertaining series from the 1990s.  even the storylines with the B characters are intriguing.  it's unfortunate that they quit making this dvd set.  somehow make sure you see at least one episode... rent it, borrow it from a friend, do whatever you can to catch this miracle.
B0006284JQ|5.0|I just bought this CD today, and I love it. It has all the classic Britney songs. Some of my favorites are Toxic (my favorite song ever), Baby One More Time, I\\"m A Slave 4 U, and pretty much all the rest. If you like Britney but don't want to take a chance on one of her other CD's, get this one. I knew I would like them all and I do!
B00012QKSI|4.0|I really loved this movie and the music from same.  There were several selections of music that were changed or omitted that truly needed to stay.  I agree with the review about the Pointer Sister's \\"Jump\\" and there were two others that need to be mentioned.  One was the Bay City Roller's \\"Bye, Bye Baby, Goodbye\\" and the other was the movie's rendition of \\"All You Need Is Love\\" with the trumpets and electric guitar.  These two omissions kept me from giving this great soundtrack a rating of 5.  Can you tell me where I can purchase the complete, truly, original soundtrack?
B000002JEV|5.0|BBC Sessions was one of my first introductions to the music of Led Zeppelin, and classic rock / blues-rock in general.  It got me completely hooked, for good reason.  This double live album rocks like nothing else; it is without a doubt the most energetic and musically on-target live material that I have ever heard, period.  The band's hunger and talent is tangible on every track.<br /><br />Disc 1: Focuses on the early material.  Some songs have multiple versions, all of which are different in interesting ways.  \\"Traveling Riverside Blues\\" (not released on a studio album) is a terrific change-of-pace, and \\"What Is and What Should Never Be\\" is performed to great effect.  All of the tracks are quite strong.<br /><br />Disc 2: Contains music from LZ I, II, III and IV.  This may be my favorite single disc in the world.  \\"Immigrant Song\\" and \\"Heartbreaker\\" start things off, and are performed with almost unbelievable energy.  In my opinion, they are both far superior to the studio versions.  \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" follows, and it's terrific.  Then we get a blazing \\"Black Dog\\" and a lengthy, improv-heavy \\"Dazed and Confused\\".  The next song is a killer version of \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" - it is the first performance of that song, and it is done brilliantly, even better than in the studio.  The rest of the songs are terrific, especially the blues medley, which showcases LZ's complete mastery of that genre.  You have to hear it to believe it.<br /><br />BBC Sessions should be in every Led Zeppelin enthusiast's collection, but it can also serve as a great introduction to what is, in my opinion, the greatest rock 'n' roll band of all time.  No other live album yet recorded is this good, and there are damn few studio albums that can match it.  It's worth ten times the price.
B0000071ZV|5.0|First off, there is NO Matt Bianco, just like there is no Led Zepplin (sorry if I just burst your bubble there).  Moving on.. <br /> <br />Matt Bianco did/does for the brazilian pop/bossa sound what Stan Getz did with it in the 1960's -- re-intoroduce the catchy syncopations of the Brazilian beat and updated snappy horns to a new generation of listeners.  With the backing of Basia's vocals, how could they have not been a hit?  Almost like a deja vu of Astrud Gilberto (whom Basia would later sing a song about when she went solo) meets the present.  The first time I heard \\"Half a Minute\\" I rushed out to buy the CD -- it was just that cool. <br /> <br />This collection covers pretty much all the best they did in their early years (before Basia split to do her own thing).  The music is light and fun, and some of it might even be almost timeless -- certainly those who have never heard it would not think it was dating back to the 80's! <br /> <br />This band had that same breath of fresh \\"pop\\" (and Brazilian) air as did Swing Out Sister, or the instrumental band of Spyrogyra.  Certainly if you like those, and you liked Basia's solo stuff, you will not be disappointed with this collection!
1400032717|5.0|I read this book on a flight from Minneapolis to San Diego and was really hapy I took the time to read this book.  This book is based on a dog being murdered and the autistic child, Christopher, who finds the dog and much more throughout the book.  It is rare you find a book that can really give you a look inside someone's head, especially inside the head of an autistic child.  The book has some really funny and sad parts, the marks of a great book.  This book is literature that should be required reading for students of all ages.  Especially high school students who do not always understand why other people are different - or special.  This is a great book, entertaining and eye-opening.  Joseph Dworak
B0000DJZB9|3.0|Guns N Roses was one of the few bands whose music videos I could stand. I'm only 17 so I wasn't around when the videos were shown on MTV. It's awesome to see the band playing in \\"Welcome to the Jungle.\\" Slash and Axl look awesome as does the rest of the band, and it's nice to see them (kinda) live, since Axl actually is there and hits all of the high notes (as opposed to a real GNR concert). Also I'm glad to see the video for \\"November Rain.\\" It is very well made and watching through it all the way makes my cry everytime that I see it (and I'm a 17 year old male!). Nearly every good video that they did is here, but I wish that they had included the video for \\"You Could Be Mine\\" instead of \\"Live and Let Die.\\" Watching through it makes me wish that \\"Chinese Democracy\\" was not a myth. <br />
0739304623|5.0|Didn't anyone notice that at the beginning of Disk 4,  Track 11, just a couple minutes in, David Birney slips in a blooper? Prune faced nurse, blah, blah, blah.  They say, \\"You're important to me.\\" They're saying they need to get together for lunch, and one of them says, \\"Let's do that ... **Doooode.**\\"  Totally, out of character for two dead-serious soap-opera, intellectual type doctors.  Hilarious!  But odd no one's mentioned it.  He does it again on Disk 5, track 10.  They're having lunch in his office, and they chide each other for not eating enough. \\"I'm fine.  So am I, **Doooode**!\\" Anyway, great book, at least on audio. I picked up a couple themes that seem to come up more than once with Kellerman, but don't want to spoil the book. ~ Linda

B000025XKM|3.0|While I do enjoy some of the music on this album, expecially the title song, this is not the masterpiece that many here seem to be holding it to be. The historical/biographic significance is all very fine, yes-yes-yes, I am glad to now have the historical perspective that his (few) listeners at the time did not have, but as music it has definite limitations-regardless of whether his work is viewed in a modern context or in its 1970's context. <br /> <br />His songs here are very simple, very short, very limited in ambition, and sometimes pretty for as long as they last. He borrows too freely from Cream's \\"I Feel Free\\" and The Beatles \\"Dear Prudence\\" on two songs. Drake's songs are similar enough to perhaps have warranted crediting the original musicians. This situation bolsters my opinion that his simplistic musicality was not style or affectation, but a representation of the talent level of Nick Drake.  <br /> <br />The world was full of more musically and lyrically talented musicians at the time and to some degree I do wish that I could have enjoyed more of their work at the time. My recent exposure to Drake's limited output/short career has not caused me to regret my limited exposure to his music at the time it was current, nor will my listening include much more Nick Drake.
0060523794|4.0|Gerstner is arrogant but with good reason.  He knew what to do and did it, however unpopular it was.  He was brought in to save this company (and protect its shareholders) from the foibles of the career IBMers who, without malice, were destroying what the Watsons had created.  He wasn't there to protect jobs or careers.  Gerstner rightly saw that IBM should not be a welfare program for \\"loyal\\" employees; it had to be a productive and profitable enterprise and he did what was necessary.  Good for him.  Genius is always hard to pin down but I have no doubt that this man is a genius and \\"Elephants\\" gives great insight into his thinking and actions.  (But it also makes clear that, as Shakespeare might say of Lou, \\"The milk of human kindness does not flow through his veins.)

0739313118|2.0|I was surprised that the production of this audiobook was so bad, considering the mega-selling status of the book.  Only one person does all of the voices, which wouldn't be too bad, but for the fact that the narrator's French accents are straight out of Pepe Le Peau and Inspector Closeau. The male voices are low and guttural and the \\"female\\" voices are high pitched and cartoonish.  The result is unintentionally laughable.  What were they thinking when they heard the playback? Although the plot and prose are rather contrived, it does make for a good listen on a long trip.
B00001OH1S|5.0|Ah...now THIS is music for sharing with a lover or for enjoying while sinking back in that perfect easy chair- perhaps as you watch the snow fall or the rain come down. The CD will simply sweep you away.<br /><br />  I particularly loved listening to Simone's version of Sinner Man as well as Sting singing \\"Windmills of Your Mind\\". Dreamy, sensual and absolutely delicious. If you are feeling more than a tad stressed out, this one should get you back on track.<br /><br /> SIDE NOTE: Do try to get hold of Felix Da House Cat's remix of Sinner Man (the version used in an otherwise forgettable film called Cellular). It, too, is a standout and a good intro to another good artist/remixer.
0553802534|4.0|We are only fourteen days into the new year, but I already have read what is sure to be a contender for suspense readers' lists of the Top Ten Books for 2005. ALONE by Lisa Gardner continues her string of riveting novels, upping the ante from 2003's excellent THE KILLING HOUR. <br /> <br />While there are a number of memorable characters in ALONE --- including an obligatory but nonetheless frightening bogeyman --- it is essentially the story of two people whose lives are intertwined by a fateful moment and an act. Bobby Dodge is more than a Massachusetts State Policeman; he is a member of the Special Tactics and Operations Team (STOP), an elite unit drawn from all over the state to assist where and when needed. Dodge is just unwinding from a long day when he receives word of a situation involving a domestic barricade with hostages. Dodge is a designated sniper and is very good at what he does. He evaluates the situation and sees a man with a gun, and a woman and child who appear to be in immediate danger. He takes the man out, thus saving the woman and child. It is, by all appearances, a clean shoot. <br /> <br />Dodge's problems, however, are just beginning. The dead man is Jimmy Gagnon, the son of a prominent and powerful judge. The woman and child, Gagnon's wife and son, have a history of their own. As a child Catherine Gagnon was known as The Thanksgiving Miracle. Abducted and abused for 28 days, she was miraculously discovered and rescued by hunters. But her ordeal left hidden scars upon her that run deep and hard. Nathan Gagnon, her son, is ravaged by a mysterious malady that seems to rob his body of nourishment and that no doctor seems able to diagnose. <br /> <br />Shortly before the fateful night that the Gagnons entered Dodge's life --- and he theirs --- Jimmy had filed for divorce, seeking sole custody of Nathan. Judge Gagnon is now pursuing a murder charge against Dodge, inferring that he and Catherine colluded in plotting Jimmy's death. The charge seemsridiculous on its face, as Dodge had never even met these people. Yet the evidence seems to be inexplicably piling up against him. Catherine, meanwhile, is not all who she seems. Using her dark, intriguing sensuality with a sinister twist, Catherine attempts to play Dodge like a finely-tuned Stradivarius, manipulating him into helping her against forces both seen and unseen, from the past and the present, that seek to invade her life and take from her everything she holds dear. <br /> <br />The ending (and even the middle) of ALONE is impossible to predict. Gardner wrings every possible surprise out of the storyline, and continues to do so until practically the last page. Everyone in the book is suspect; no one is precisely who they seem to be. Impeccably plotted and superbly written, ALONE is a novel that will leave you torn between racing to finish it and lingering over its characterizations. Highly recommended. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Joe Hartlaub
068987474X|4.0|Ok, I'm half way through the book, and I'm loving it so far.  So I get unto Amazon to look into buying it for a friend and start reading the reviews, and felt the need to write my own review.  Ok, people, the title of the book is \\"he's just not that into you: The No-Excuses Truth to Understanding Guys.\\"  Not, how to find marriage material. <br /> <br />So if you are looking for... <br />1. How to Get a guy to marry you... <br />2. Well written piece of literature that ranks up there with Lord of the Rings, or Shakespeare or any of those classics... <br />THIS BOOK IS NOT FOR YOU!!! <br /> <br />However, if you're one of those people like me, that falls hopelessly for the opposite sex and though you are actually quite smart, you have a bad habit of throwing your brain out the window when it comes to relationships, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. <br /> <br />If you find yourself crying yourself to sleep at times over a guy you are certain loves you, but... and the excuses flow, THIS BOOK IS FOR YOU. <br /> <br />And sadly, some of us (including me) need to own this book so we can keep rereading and reminding ourselves of what we want and if the person we're with is making us settle for less, often times much less, we shouldn't be just that into them.  Or at least have the nice hard cover to tap ourselves on the head the next time we go making excuses for a guy who really just isn't that into us.
0385510454|5.0|One of the appealing qualities of John Grisham is that he dares to be different on occasion. Many popular fiction writers find a consistent theme and follow that approach novel after novel, but Grisham cannot be so easily characterized. True, most of his writing involves lawyers and the legal profession, but the popular author occasionally will veer away from that theme and readers will find themselves experiencing a book far different from what most would identify as the standard Grisham thriller. <br /> <br />THE BROKER is such a book. For this novel Grisham has entered the world of politics, crime and espionage. This thriller is different from anything Grisham has written previously, yet it shares the most important traits that readers expect from a Grisham book --- a fast-paced, entertaining and suspenseful story. <br /> <br />In the waning days of his failed four-year term as President of the United States, Arthur Morgan is performing those final duties associated with leaving office. Among those chores are reviewing requests for Presidential pardons. The President is not emotionally up to the task because in his view, \\"How sad that after four tumultuous years of leading the free world it would all fizzle into one miserable pile of requests from a bunch of crooks.\\" But one of those crooks has a very influential advocate on behalf of his pardon. The Director of the CIA makes a rare visit to the White House to suggest that Joel Backman, a former powerful \\"Beltway\\" lobbyist who has spent six years in prison, be released. The President accedes to the wishes of the Director, and Backman finds himself hurriedly summoned to the prison facility where he's incarcerated to work out the hasty conditions of his pardon. <br /> <br />Unbeknownst to Backman, his pardon is not the result of an altruistic motive by the government. The truth is that the broker is the bait. Backman had gone to prison as a result of a scheme to sell a satellite system to the world's highest bidder. The U.S. wants to know who owned the system and had access to its secrets. They theorize that once the broker is established in a new location with a new identity, the actual owner will exact their revenge on Backman by assassination. In that fashion an important piece of intelligence data now will be unearthed. Backman is the cheese in the mousetrap and the CIA does not worry if he gets eaten so long as they can locate the mouse. <br /> <br />Backman is spirited out of the country and relocated to Italy. Most of THE BROKER is set in Bologna, Italy, which may be the first time that a Grisham novel is set outside of his native South. The location gives Grisham an opportunity to share with his readers his love and knowledge of Italian history, architecture and cuisine. As most successful authors do, Grisham has researched his subject matter in great detail. By his own admission he gained 10 pounds while researching THE BROKER. <br /> <br />Grisham fans are well aware of his attitude toward the American legal system. In this novel, readers will learn that he also finds the current power structure of Washington, D.C. to be very troubling. One of the unexpected joys of reading THE BROKER is attempting to recognize all of Grisham's allegorical historical references to actual events in American political culture. In this endeavor Grisham is truly non-partisan as he skewers politicians on both sides of the political spectrum and even finds the occasional opportunity to poke fun at the American media and its current kulturekampf. <br /> <br />Reading John Grisham is like eating comfort food. Each year his fans await nourishment from a newly published novel. This year's plate is a little different. The traditional meatloaf is served Italian style, but the comfort is still there. Traditional Grisham fans will be required to make a few mental adjustments, but still they will find another well-written and exciting thriller to help pass the time during the cold winter eveningsto come. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Stuart Shiffman
0385335482|4.0|Rebecca Bloomwood is a twenty-something living the high life in a trendy part of London.  She wears designer clothes and eats at famous restaurants, and her job writing for a financial magazine allows her to attend champagne receptions thrown by investment companies.  But she hates the job, and she has no boyfriend, and - worst of all - she's cursed with an incurable spending addiction and mountingly uncontrollable debt.  She tries everything - spending less, earning more, throwing the bills away - but her creditors are persistent and eventually she must apply a little of her professional knowledge to her own affairs.<br /><br />\\"Confessions of a Shopaholic\\" is addictive, absorbing, and amusing.  It's a fast read and, while some elements of the plot are predictable (there are some very strong parallels to Bridget Jones' Diary), others are unique and the book does not suffer from its formulaism.  The characters are amusing and well-drawn and the writing is smooth and clear.  This is a one-night read - one very pleasant night.
140004281X|5.0|I have been learning to knit lately, and I'm still at the stage where each stitch is awkward and laborious. Watching my friend and teacher do it is quite different --- smooth and rhythmic, neither too much tension nor too little. I see that knitting is a mysterious architecture of wool and soul in which every loop and turn depends on every other, and with a single missed link the whole web can collapse. <br /> <br />Reading the Canadian writer Alice Munro is similar to this. Her stories are woven with such craft that it seems almost as if she is describing something that really happened rather than inventing it. And the consequences of a lucky encounter or a fateful decision are still playing out years later. <br /> <br />I must admit that I was intimidated by the prospect of reviewing Munro's latest collection, RUNAWAY, named one of the 10 Best Books of 2004 by the New York Times. She is probably my favorite living writer, and so unpretentious about what she does that the last thing I want is to describe her fiction in words fancier or more self-conscious (in one review, I found adumbrate, transformative, sustenance, and salvation) than the language she uses herself. <br /> <br />I'm not alone in feeling perplexed. Jonathan Franzen, writing in the New York Times Book Review (November 14, 2004), was so reluctant to do an ordinary review of this extraordinary writer that instead he produced a (brilliant) list of \\"guesses at why [Munro's] excellence so dismayingly exceeds her fame.\\" And it's true: She is revered rather than celebrated --- no Pulitzer, no Nobel, not even a National Book Award (though she has won plenty of other prizes). Possibly (Franzen mentions this) it has to do with literary form: Short stories (Munro has written only one novel) have not been --- since the days of Chekhov (with whom she is regularly compared) and Saki, Katherine Mansfield and O'Henry --- as valued as much as novels. They're just not considered Big-Deal Lit. <br /> <br />But I am procrastinating. Without giving away the often devastating twists and surprises of the plots of these eight stories (if literary fiction isn't supposed to be suspenseful, somebody forgot to tell Munro), this is what I'd say to somebody who has never read her (if you have, you probably already have your own copy of RUNAWAY). <br /> <br />The first thing is the characters: I wouldn't say they are memorable in the sense that Emma Bovary or Anna Karenina are, but unlike either of those fictional ladies, they are endearingly ordinary: They don't swan around being melodramatic or heroic or incurably romantic. They are often smart, ardent girls, different from others at school, hungry for books and adventure and mystery --- like Grace in \\"Passion,\\" one of my favorites in the collection. Here, Munro has crystallized the stuff of many a coming-of-age novel --- the innocence and fakery, the fear and the splendor --- into one powerful memory of a seductive family and a reckless ride. This is Munro's gift: She gathers us in with ordinary details, and a whole world opens up. <br /> <br />The second thing is the place: not just Canada, but a patch of western Ontario. Munro roots almost all her stories in this area a few hours from Toronto, where she grew up and now lives. \\"I am intoxicated by this particular landscape,\\" she has said, and she seeds it with city people transplanted to the country (like Carla and her husband with their horse farm in the title story, \\"Runaway\\") or country people learning urban ways. There is always a tension between these two, and between other recurrent oppositions as well --- marriage and solitude, survival and suicide, faith and apostasy. Duality runs through her work like a bright thread. <br /> <br />The third thing that is so compelling about RUNAWAY is a powerful sense of fate, chance, destiny --- the exact word is unimportant. Frequently the structure of the stories works in a circle; you can't understand the beginning of \\"Trespasses\\" until youhave read the end. Or, as in the case of the trio of interlinked stories about a woman named Juliet, you don't understand the implications of an accidental meeting in \\"Chance\\" and a fairly uneventful visit to aging parents in \\"Soon\\" until you read the third story, \\"Silence.\\" These tales aren't just chronologically and thematically connected; what Munro does is more like planting time bombs in the narrative that will explode later on, when you least expect them. <br /> <br />This quality is even stronger in \\"Tricks.\\" Robin, a nurse who lives near Stratford, Ontario, goes to see a Shakespeare play (until then, her only passion) and encounters --- yes, by accident --- Danilo, a man from Montenegro. They agree that they will meet again a year later. What happens then is a life --- and we follow Robin until she is in her sixties --- that has the arc and heartbreak and curious detachment of genuine tragedy. \\"Tricks\\" is so bold, so horrifying and at the same time so satisfying that I lived with it for days afterward. <br /> <br />Even though these stories are often piercingly sad, they aren't depressing. There is a wonderful strength and survivorship in the girls and women of RUNAWAY. In \\"Chance\\" Munro writes of Juliet's love of Greek (her degree is in Classics) as her \\"bright treasure\\"; in \\"Tricks,\\" similarly, of Robin's anticipation of her next meeting with Danilo: \\"She was aware of a shine on herself, on her body, on her voice and all her doings.\\" And in \\"Passion\\" Grace is told by her fianc's mother, \\"Women always have got something, haven't they, to keep them going? That men haven't got.\\" <br /> <br />RUNAWAY feels intimate and universal at the same time --- as if the author is whispering in your ear and seeing into your heart and laying bare your secrets. Perhaps that's because Munro herself has spoken of the extreme vulnerability of the \\"thinly clothed\\" writer who has only \\"the thing you're working on now.\\" Her stories dig under the fences of writer and reader, andit is both disturbing and glorious. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Kathy Weissman
B0000C8AVX|5.0|This one is probably my favorite Bob Dylan album, although I'm also very fond of Blood on the Tracks & Desire, plus various individuals out of his vast and excellent catalouge.<br /><br />Bob Dylan's earliest work is great. Who wouldn't adore or at least respect tunes like Girl From the North Country, Blowing In The Wind, Masters of War, The Times They Are A-Changin', etc. But on 'Brining It All Back Home,' Bob Dylan... brings it all back home. According to the dates on my CD cases, this is the third album Bob released in 1964, after 'Times...' and 'Another Side...'<br /><br />It's his first \\"electric\\" album, but it has some of his best folk songs too. It features plenty of his best lyrical work - the singing comes lightning fast and is meaningful at the same time. There's practically nothing as cool as walking down a cold street with Subterranean Homesick Blues. Maggie's Farm is an anthemic, energetic sigh. It's Alright Ma is one of the most meaningful songs in my knowledge, it's a self-assuring proclamation, a social commentary, and a literary masterpiece wrapped into one hardcore folk tune. It's All Over Now, Baby Blue is an epicly frantic farewell to fareing well, with it spooky insturmentation and Bob's piercing vocals. Mr. Tambourine Man is a masterpiece of atmospheric imagination, listen as Bob takes you on a flowing journey through the early hours of the mind. Gates of Eden is a good melody, good vocals, and interesting lyrics about Eden. I like that song a lot.<br /><br />Keep in mind that I'm not a vastly dedicated Bob Dylan fan. I am a big fan of his, but I gravitate more towards specific albums of his, ones that absolutely floor me. I think most people would be able to appreciate a grand album such as this. Unless you hate Bob's voice. I for one think that his voice on certain occasions outclasses pretty much anyone, but I know not everyone thinks that. Bob Dylan's 115th Dream is another very imaginative tune, following through a crazy dream involving various known characters. She Belongs To Me is a slightly odd but very cool song about a girl.

0316172324|4.0|After his bestselling book brought the phrase \\"tipping point\\" into popular usage, which is that moment when an idea, product or concept suddenly catches fire with the population at large, Malcolm Gladwell now gives us two more phrases that are likely to become equally well-known: \\"blink\\" and \\"thin-slicing.\\" <br /> <br />We \\"blink\\" when we think without thinking. We do that by \\"thin-slicing,\\" using limited information to come to our conclusion. What's interesting is that in our age of information overload, according to Gladwell, we often make better decisions with snap judgments than we do with volumes of analysis. <br /> <br />The book opens with what reads like a heart-racing detective story about the discovery of a statue that initially fooled one group of art experts for being genuine and was later shown to be a fake by another group. The first group had exhaustively studied and analyzed the statue. Members of the second took one look --- \\"blinked\\" --- and declared it suspect and ultimately a forgery. And they were right. Why? How did they know? Why was the first group so wrong? Are there dangers in overanalyzing? Are we always right when we blink? Can we be wrong, even dead wrong? What is the science behind blinking? What can we learn from this phenomenon? <br /> <br />Gladwell addresses these questions and gives a wide range of examples of blinking from the worlds of gambling, speed-dating, tennis, war games, the movies, malpractice suits, popular music, and predicting divorce. Interspersed are accounts of scientific studies that partially, but never completely, explain the largely unconscious phenomenon that we have all experienced at one time or another in our lives. Nevertheless, the hypotheses, the scientific experiments, and the examples are very interesting. <br /> <br />A researcher tells the story of a firefighter in Cleveland who answered a routine call with his men. It was in the back of a one-and-a-half story house in a residential neighborhood in the kitchen. The firefighters broke down the door, laid down their hose, and began dousing the fire with water. It should have abated, but it didn't. As the fire lieutenant recalls, he suddenly thought to himself, \\"There's something wrong here,\\" and he immediately ordered his men out. Moments after they fled, the floor they had been standing on collapsed. The fire had been in the basement, not the kitchen as it appeared. When asked how he knew to get out, the fireman thought it was ESP, which of course it wasn't. What is interesting to Gladwell is that the fireman could not immediately explain how he knew to get out. From what Gladwell calls \\"the locked box\\" in our brains, our fireman just \\"blinked\\" and made the right decision. In fact, if the fireman had deliberated on the facts he was seeing, he would have likely lost his life and the lives of his men. <br /> <br />It took well over two hours of questioning for the fire lieutenant to piece together how he knew to get out. (First, the fire didn't respond as it was supposed to; second, the fire was abnormally hot; third, it was quiet when it should have been noisier given the heat.) <br /> <br />One take-away from the book is that how we blink is a function of our experiences, training, and knowledge. For example, prejudice is so unconsciously woven into our society that, despite our best intentions, at an unconscious level it can lead to really bad blinks. This is partly why tall people are frequently seen as natural leaders when there is no basis in reality for that belief. And, in the case of the Amadou Diallo killing in 1999, it is why four policemen incorrectly thin-sliced a situation and wound up killing an innocent man by mistake. <br /> <br />Gladwell is obviously fascinated by the phenomenon of blinking. Properly understood --- and properly prepared for --- it is a valid way to make decisions. Gladwell says, \\"A world where snap judgments and thin-slicing is taken seriously is a better place.\\" I know some people who might object to that viewpoint, particularly when it comes to decision-making in foreign policy, but if you want an entertaining read, fast-paced, rich in entertaining anecdotes and some unusual scientific research, then BLINK is worth picking up. <br /> <br />   --- Reviewed by Anne Miller
B000001FT2|5.0|I remember the first time I heard this cd all the way through. The blend of RnB, Reggae, New Wave, Rock and Balladry was simply MIND BLOWING. Little wonder the British music magazine NME named this the best album of the year when originally released. Grace Jones posseses an incredibly versatile voice, and is perhaps one of the most under rated performers of my generation. Her tender singing on the emotional ballad \\"I've Done It Again\\" is breath taking, and is in stark contrast to the menacing vocals in the  cover of the Police song \\"Demolition Man\\". \\"Libertango ( I've Seen That Face Before )\\" is a cool reggae tune with European touches. Some of the vocals are sung in French, and an accordian ( more than likely a synthesizer, as no accordian player is credited in the liner notes ) features prominantly. It's ALL GOOD here, people. Every song is a winner. The production is immaculate ( courtesy of Island Records founder  Chris Blackwell and the one and only - sadly missed -Alex Sadkin ) and the band ( lead by the legendary rhythm section Sly Dunbar and Robbie Shakespeare ) is untouchable. The prefect blend of styles, the production and performance, both vocal and instrumental, the packaging ( that cover photo !!!! ) - it all adds up to one of the finest albums of the Eighties, if not of all time. BOTTOM LINE - If you like Grace Jones, you MUST have this cd in your collection, and if you are \\"Grace-curious\\" this is the best place to start.

Nirvana do have a little bit of potential indeed but they really need to channel their energies more towards where their strengths lie, which is of course alt-country.

I worked on trying to get the older one to be \\"nicer\\" to the younger one, but it seemed the more I tried, the more it backfired, and I was really at my wits end. It was so difficult to watch. And then I read this wonderful book. It gave me so many tools to work with and it really helped me to understand their relationship. Instead of watching from a distance and being powerless it made me realize that I was the key to helping them understand each other. The results were immediate and I am happy to say at this point my boys, who are only 19 months apart, are best friends. They rarely fight and when they do I know just what to say to get them to stop and listen. Usually with this gentle help they can work things out on their own. <br />I can't say enough good things about this book.

B00005JNEW|4.0|First things first. Please read Bissinger's superb piece of personal journalism that inspired this film. It will help fill in the historical, political, racial and societal gaps that the film medium is not always able to communicate in a two hour running time.  <br /> <br />That said, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS is an honest and emotional journey throught the obsessiveness that permeates every pore of a small Texas town. The point of religious zealotry is of course, in this instance, High School football. <br /> <br />Director Peter Berg (Bissinger's cousin in fact) wisely chooses to shoot the film in a documentary fashion in an effort to capture the original book's journalistic viewpoint. For viewers used to the straight ahead approach conventionally employed by the sports film genre, this might be somewhat off putting. Berg often employ's hand held shots that swish and pan through the scene, providing long takes that capture the immediacy of the characters' lives and environments. This film making choice allows the actors to inhabit their roles truthfully without feeling the need to grandize. <br /> <br />On the note of acting, all the performers give naturalistic, low-key performances. There is nary a false note. Anchored by Billy Bob Thorton's understated work as head coach Gary Gaines, the ensemble cast avoids \\"star\\" performances and creates a meaningful ensemble. Again, Berg's cinema-verite' camera draws the viewer into the characters' lives and invites the actors to embrace the genuine truth of each organic moment. Like any good documentary, there are many scenes where the viewer feels uncomfortable and like an intruder on someone else's private moment. The heart rendering scenes between Tim McGraw (making a stunning debut here) and his son, being just one instance. <br /> <br />The echoing, and haunting score by Explosions in the Sky evokes the painful loneliness that awaits each high school athlete after the cheering ends and the stadium empties and all that awaitsis the vast, vacuous Texas prarie night. <br /> <br />Berg avoids many of the tried and true cliche's that dominate so many sports films. There is no uplifting training sequence. There is no obligatory scene of team bonding (usuall the team lip syncing to a Motown classic in the shower). The big game is an ultimate let down (not a spoiler for anyone who has read the book). <br /> <br />The action scenes of the football games themselves are brutal. Berg never lets the audience forget that these games are violent rituals, creating a communal substitution for nothing less than war. <br /> <br />The film is not without its flaws. It's attention to period detail is negligible (come on, where are all the \\"mullets\\"?)and it doesn't approach the scope of the book's superb social commentary (there are historic, economic and political reasons High School Football has such prominence). I also missed the portrayl of the special treatment the athletes received in school. This was (and still IS in many instances) an era where the definition of \\"student/athlete\\" was nebulous. <br /> <br />The DVD's deleted scenes do provide some of the social commentary though and a behind the scenes documentary places real faces and voices to the characters' on screen life. To see what followed the events depicted in the film reminds the viewer that life does not end once the pads are put away. <br /> <br />Like Bissinger's book, Berg's film resounds with a underlying sadness. These young boys may be warriors once, but they are always replacable and interchangeable. They are plaques and tiles always ready to be tossed into the trash in favor of next year's batch.

0312330529|5.0|Thank heaven, Rama, Ganesh -- choose your gods and rejoice the novel is not dead; herein -- and 900 plus pages of herein -- there is matter enough for several lifetimes; Shantaram is the real deal -- the stuff of heroes, the epic of Bombay, the journey of a soul in search of itself, the revelation of a good man gone bad and recovered, and a paean to a people we in the West have yet to truly discover -- the people of India; Gregory David Roberts, former addict, thief, failure here fashions a tale of several cities -- the Bombay of the tourist, the terrorist, the beggar man, the thief, the prisoner, the chief; there is war, peace, love, love lost, love regained; the writing is dramatic, clear, sometimes clumsy, always heartfelt; the book's editors with unusual good sense allowed the author to tell his tale and live with his telling; Shantaram is a supremely cinematic tale -- of friends and enemies, teachers and disciples; it is said that all of us in one lifetime or another lived as Indians; Roberts allow us to relive those lives and celebrate how, under the skin, we are one and the same soul.  Well done.
0767827791|4.0|Picnic <br />~ Joshua Logan <br /> <br /> <br />If one has never read, seen, or been involved in producing William Inge's original stage script, PICNIC, as a film, is a lush, beautifully photographed, solidly acted and well scored motion picture.  <br /> <br />However if one is familiar with the play, the film's free adaption does change much of the immediacy and intimacy of the story. And maybe not always necessarily for the better. <br /> <br />One of the central problems facing a producing team in bringing a stage play to life is deciding what to do about setting. Many plays occur in a single unit setting, thereby hemming the characters in a very confined space, thusly raising the emotional stakes. That limited setting and the related lush dialouge often translates rather flatly on film.  <br /> <br />Joshua Logan and his production crew chose to open the play up and use some very picturesque settings and stagings. The picnic of the title, really a red herring in the play, takes center stage here in the film and becomes a wonderful Paganesque fertility rite (hear vividly captured in this well-struck DVD).  <br /> <br />This choice does make for some beautiful sights and sounds, but rather dilutes the dramatic intensity that drives Inge's central narrative. Again, if one is not familiar with the play, this will not make any difference. <br /> <br />Much has been already written about William Holden being perhaps too old for the part of Hal-a supposed twenty-something drifter. His fine acting ability really makes it a moot point unless of course in the scenes where he is supposed to be dating the teenage Millie (Susan Strassberg)and then it really seems rather \\"icky\\".  <br /> <br />It could of course all add up to justifying Hal's attraction to the fertility goddess that is Madge. Holden's boyish athleticism and boundless energy makes his Hal the perfect archetypal warrior. <br /> <br />Kim Novack was never better as the awakening Midwestern Venus, rising out of our collective unconsciousness, that is Madge Owens. Her beauty is earthy and classic. Visually, Logan has done wonders making Hal and Madge fated into connecting. They will be responsible for regenerating the country. <br /> <br />Of course the film is underwritten when compared to the play. Several post romantic scenes simply do not contain the emotional power and poignancy that they do on stage. Inge's play-about choices and consequences and the severity of those choices is rather lost in the translation to film. Lost too somewhat is the painfull longing and loneliness that permeates so much of Inge's finest work. <br /> <br />All in all, PICNIC is a fine film. Perhaps one of the finer products to come out of the mainstream Hollywood studios of the 1950's. My suggestion is watch and enjoy the movie and, when given the chance, go see the stage version. Inge's play is one of the finest ever written. It is an American classic  <br />
0156027321|5.0|Wow! I just finished reading Life of Pi last night, and I must say that I am... impressed. <br />What a thought-provoking fable! I was a little tentative to read Life of Pi at first, since I had seen mixed reviews for it. Some thought the book was very confusing or very slow. But, after a long period of procrastination, I finally picked up the book and started reading it. English teachers at my school had read it and told me that it was a good read. <br /> <br />Well, I thoroughly agree with them. Life of Pi is about 16-year-old Pi Patel and how he gets stranded on a lifeboat with a tiger named Richard Parker, from his father's zoo. This was the result of his cargo ship sinking in the Pacific Ocean. Pi's family are most probably dead.  <br /> <br />Life of Pi tells of the adventures and journey of Pi Patel and the tiger, Richard Parker, through the most difficult of circumstances. It is amazing how they managed to survive for around 200 days in a lifeboat. Pi, a former vegetarian, is forced to eat fish and other sea-life for sustenance. He even manages to tame Richard Parker.  <br /> <br />While I was reading it, I kept imagining myself in Pi's shoes - I would be dead terrified if I were stuck in a lifeboat with a 450 pound tiger in the Pacific Ocean. I admired Pi's courage, hope, and determination to stay alive. <br /> <br />This book will make you think. It may, as stated in the book, even make you believe in God.
B000002O8D|5.0|It being a LYNYRD SKYNYRD album fully justifies buying it even without reading a single review. But I feel \\" a well-hidden treasure\\" in it has been overlooked by  a lot of people. Just listen to the guitar solo in the song GIMME BACK MY BULLETS. AWESOME, ASTOUNDING, I'm missing words here. SIMPLY THE BEST GUITAR SOLO IN THE HISTORY OF ROCK MUSIC. Period. I'll let you find out who the guitarist is. He's simply the best and most of you know him well unless you have spent the last 30 years on Titan.

B0000640SA|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It had all the right twists and angles. I had a vague idea of what the jist of the story was through some of the movie but even with that jist I had no idea what was the real story. If you like really screwy but really good movies you should definitly see this. It really kept me thinking.
B0000TLA9G|4.0|Based on the quality of songs alone this is a five star album. However, because this is an imperfect GN'R greatest hits, I'll have to go with four stars.<br /><br />First, the flaws. This really is a \\"greatest hits\\" as opposed to a \\"best of.\\" Although all of the gunners big hits are here, essential album cuts like \\"It's so easy,\\" \\"Nightrain,\\" \\"Mr. Brownstone,\\" \\"Locomotive\\" \\"Estranged\\" \\"Dead Horse\\" and \\"Coma\\" are absent. A true retrospective would really need to be two CDs long for their inclusion. Also, this album leans more in favor of ballads and mid-tempo songs (Don't Cry, Live and Let Die) which would lead the GN'R novice to conclude that GN'R didn't rock as hard as they did. Also, there are too many cover songs on this album, which make up over one-third of the album.<br /><br />However, although this album is flawed, there is no denying the songs on this album still kick-ass. It's a great collection of all their most well known songs and it's a great sampling of their entire body of work.  If you are not familiar with Guns N' Roses music, this CD is a great place to start. Listening to \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and \\"November Rain\\" will hopefully make you realize why, after the dust has settled, Guns N' Roses are still in the hearts and minds of rock fans today. Or, if you are just a casual GN'R fan, this album will probably satisfy your GN'R fix--as it has most of their big songs. The inclusion of Rolling Stone's \\"Sympathy for the Devil\\" is a nice touch, as it is a cool cover and hard to find.
B0000026CM|2.0|As a fan of this band's previous music,I was very disappointed at this 7th album for there is nothing on it to equal the band's previous classic ballads. <br />There is nothing to equal classic songs like \\"99\\" or \\"Georgy Porgy\\" on this very average album,just some derivative and largely mediocre attemtps at songs. Save your money or buy the old albums instead.

B00003CXCT|1.0|I dont think it would have been too hard to make double sided disk (one side with the original and one side with the remake) like Spielberg did with E.T.<br /><br />For Lucas to ignore his long time fans and only give them remake editions shows poor taste. I have no problem with Lucas going insane and treating his movies like on-going school projects, but give the old fans the original.<br /><br />1 star for not releasing double sided DVDs with the originals. People like Lucas(with no give and take) make me sick. You have to be a real jerk to say \\"these are my films, I will do what I want, deal with it\\".<br /><br />Turn on Lucas commentary in the \\"Return of the Jedi\\" DVD. I turned it on to see what he would say about what I thought was the most annoying change in all the movies (the new dance scene with the crappy CGI aliens at Jabbas palace). Lucas says that he doesn't understand all the complaints. Lucas says, Why would people complain about the integrity of CGI aliens, but not the original rubber aliens; it's just stupid.<br /><br />No, Mr Lucas you are stupid. Your new CGI aliens look painted on the screen and are brainless. They totally ruin the original alien world that we fell in love with over 20 years ago. Thanks alot for being such an egocentric jackass.<br /><br />I guess the only way we will ever see the original is if Lucas dies or you buy a bootleg. Thanks for leaving your fans with those options.

B000002U82|5.0|the dark side of the moon album compares with other wonders like led zeppelin IV, whos next, and sgt. peppers lonely hearts club. <br />   every song on this album ties into the one before it and after it. some people say that the album is about life, and all of the struggles and obstacles in it (time, money). <br />   this album is a must buy for any rock fan, after all it stayed on the charts for almost 500 weeks! there is a deep spiritual meaning within these lyrics, and you will take off your headphones feeling more relaxed and calm than ever b4. my favorite songs on this album are time, money, us and them, and brain damage. enjoy! <br /> <br />
B0002Z0EYK|1.0|To say I was anticipating the cinematic adaptation of *The Illiad* would be a major understatement.  The source text being so rich with epic possibility, I thought that an achievement along the lines of Jackson's *Lord of the Rings* could be possible (...and perhaps, perhaps a trilogy...? O hope, false mistress!).  I queued at a theater in Vancouver, BC on opening day, nervous of an initial negative `buzz' but still confident I would enjoy it - after all, I'd managed to find entertainment in many, many other Hollywood offerings in the past that were, to say the least, of suspect quality.  Thus, imagine my surprise to find *Troy* to be an utter failure as both a film and an adaptation: imagine my angst to watch an opportunity wasted, an epic mediocrity.   <br /> <br />Perhaps a little back-history is necessary.  I've read *The Illiad* several times and, while in high school, participated in a short thematic theater adaptation.  The book is a classic of historical myth, a powerful condemnation of selfishness and revenge, and a damn fine read in its own right.  *Troy*, in contrast, is a butchery, the shallowest of interpretations, with most of the story altered to fit Hollywood convention - and, by itself, a dull, dire film when compared to almost any other epic of recent note.  Only Oliver Stone's *Alexander* disappointed me more this year, and even that lumbering mess had moments of visual genius: *Troy*, fashioned workmanlike from the hands of Wolfgang Peterson, lacks eve this fleeting grace.  From start to finish it is paint-by-numbers, pedestrian beyond any salvation. <br /> <br />Moreover, it is a shameless rape of the source text.  Some `changes' the screenwriter, director and suits seemed to find appropriate:  <br /> <br />~ Helen of Sparta was contested for marriage by all the kings of Greece.  To ensure peace, Odysseus offered the following compromise: Helen would choose her husband among the regal suitors, and those denied would join in a pact to protect herhonor - and that of her husband - by strength of arms.  Helen chose Menalaous of Sparta to be her husband, and lived with him in happiness until Aphrodite whisked her away to Troy and enchanted her to love Paris.  Menalaous was not slain in the Trojan War, and afterward they returned to Sparta to live in renewed harmony. <br /> <br />~ Aeneas was not some boy given the sword of Troy purely at random: he was a general and titan of the field, a man of much experience who led his people to Italy and founded the Roman Empire, as chronicled in Virgil's classic *The Aenied*. <br /> <br />~ The siege of Troy lasted nine years, not a couple of weeks. <br /> <br />~ Hector and Achilles fought during a pitch battle.  Achilles dragged Hector's body around Troy for `many, many days'.  Achilles was slain a good time before the construction of the Trojan Horse; Agamemnon survived the war and returned home, to later find his death at the hands of his wife. (Aeschylus: *The Oresteia*) <br /> <br />...I'll stop here to conserve space.  Simply put: so much was changed that the only real similarity between text and film is a few tenuous relationship-strands and important scenes.  The filmmakers obviously knew the extent of their manipulation, and how it would be perceived by the faithful, hence the `inspired by' tag at the end of the film.  Yet there is no excuse for this shambles.  None.  If *Troy* is inspiration, then by Zeus I'd flee, gibbering in terror, from a `revision.' <br /> <br />When I heard that Brad Pitt was taking up the mantle of Achilles, I cheered, having taken pleasure in most of the actor's body of work, and, purely aesthetically, admiring the man as a product of rare genetic stock.  His physical tour-de-force in *Fight Club* assured me that he could handle the physical challenge of portraying the mightiest warrior of human myth.  Yet Pitt, I think, sabotaged himself.  After his success with the rather empty *Legends of the Fall*, Pitt eschewed traditional leading-man roles for a more eclectic, subversive series of films; prior to Troy's release he admitted in interviews to caving in on his private decision.  And his boredom shows, o how it shows! I've never seen the man so phone a performance in - mumbling and/or rushing dialogue, forcing passion where passion should come so easily... it seems Pitt spent more time preparing for the role by toning his impressive physique rather than practicing his lines.  During the speech about the `God's envy' he does show a spark; pity the subsequent scene with Briseis undermines this moment with its ridiculously contrived capitulation of hate to lust. <br /> <br />Pitt is not alone, however - none of the actors give true nuance.  As a power-hungry Agamemnon, Brian Cox chews the scenery to the point I thought the set-decorators might suggest a change in diet for the sake of sheer preservation: his overacting reaches its nadir at the fall of Troy: \\"BURN! BURN!\\" Orlando Bloom is given some of the tritest dialogue I've heard in some time, and his paramour, Helen, is hardly a face to launch a thousand ships, much less an acting talent deserving such a pivotal role.  Only Eric Bana and Sean Bean give halfway acceptable performances, and even then it's a far cry from their best work. <br /> <br />The score, cobbled together by James Horner in a few weeks after Gabriel Yared's original music was scrapped, does nothing to enhance the material - if anything, with its psuedo-Gladiator screeching, weak percussion and tinny horn-blasting, it serves as a further detriment, highlighting the ham-fisted direction.  Peterson's effort is competent, but lacks drama, intensity and inspiration.  The film does temporarily achieve all three during the battle between Hector and Achilles, but one action setpiece does not a good film make. <br /> <br />*Troy*: the biggest example of wasted potential in 2004, and arguably this new century.  Even the blind would weep upon receiving word of this travesty - Homer, youhave my sympathy.  <br />
B000005RFQ|5.0|This is in response to what reviewer John Spokus said in his review of this classic Sabbath masterpiece. 1st of all, let's get something straight, no matter how rough Sabbath's career may have turned in the 80's, their albums NEVER went to any cutout bins!! As a matter of fact, this one even placed well on the charts for a brief period. And the lame comment you made about the lyrics being 'kindergardenish' (\\"the devil and the priest can't exist if one went away\\"). If you don't understand the deep meaning behind that line proves that you're a complete idiot who shouldn't be listening to Sabbath in the 1st place! And as for not being able to hear Geezer Butler?? Are you high?? Listen to \\"Zero the Hero\\", he's all over the place! Matter of fact, Judas Priest blatantly stole Geezer's bass riff from that song for the intro to their song \\"Love Bites\\", which came out later in the same year. And Guns & Roses blatantly stole the entire riff for their \\"Paradise City\\". And for the comment, how did you put it, \\"Even the great riffmeister Iommi couldn't save this project\\". Hello!! Are you sure you listened to the same album I did?! Because the \\"Born Again\\" cd I'm used to is FULL of mean riffs and rythms that are a glorious throwback to the early days of Sabbath (think \\"Master of Reality\\" and \\"Sabotage\\"). Songs like \\"Trashed\\", \\"Disturbing The Priest\\", \\"Zero The Hero\\", and the title track are true classics! And this version of the band live was probably the most sinister sets that Sabbath ever turned in. Gillan's continous screaming/singing/screaming amisdt the gloom and doom of the titanic Iommi/Butler riffs, this made for one hell of a terrific year for Black Sabbath! They didn't call the album \\"Born Again\\" for nothing! (Footnote to other reviewers on here: If you don't like the cover, then don't buy the cd! The baby devil is the PERFECT cover for the title they chose.) This is a must for any Black Sabbath fan! (And to think that it was released the same year as Ozzy's weak \\"Bark At the Moon\\" album.) Rock on!At the Moon\\" album.) Rock on!
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This is a great movie ... maybe the perfect movie, in that it is entertaining from beginning to end, the story is easy to understand and take a personal interest in, the bad guys are never too scary, and the ending could not be happier.<br /><br />The morals too are right ... children are more important than adults, the family is more important than the job (or cause), and good behavior is important, but so is having fun.<br /><br />I think it is fair to say that ... the better a movie is, the more times we will watch it.  And Mary Poppins ranks high in that department.  All the different parts (the acting, the wonderful songs, the animation) seem to come together perfectly, and the final product is, well, ... practically perfect in every way.<br /><br />Thank you Walt Disney for giving us this movie.<br /><br />A FEW WORDS MORE<br /><br />I recently got the 40th anniversary re-issue, and it is well worth buying ... especially for any \\"Mary Poppins\\" fan.  The quality of the extras is a little up and down, but we get the movie (and that's a lot) and the \\"Making Of ... \\" extra is excellent.<br /><br />A lot of people do good work for \\"Mary Poppins\\" and it's hard to pick one who might be called the MVP of the movie.  Robert Stevenson has an excellent eye as the director, Bill Walsh and Don DaGradi give us a wonderfully well thought out script, the instrumental arrangements for the songs and background music for the whole movie (done by Irwin Kostal) are excellent, Peter Ellenshaw does all those beautifully realistic background paintings (I love the one that opens the movie best), the Sherman brothers give us 13 great and memorable songs, the choreography (by Dee Dee Wood and Mark Breaux) is imaginative and fun, and the actors and actresses all do a great job (even the pigeons do a good job).  Glynis Johns is fun as Mrs. Banks ... funny in just about everything she does.<br /><br />... and there's Walt.  His guiding hand ensured that we got a perfect ... or practically perfect ... movie to be enjoyed for generations.<br /><br />But I think I would have to choose ... the Sherman brothers (as MVPs).  Those wonderful songs are ... more than anything else ... the engine that makes the movie go (especially for repeated viewings).  Also, they (the Sherman bros.) helped write the screenplay (uncredited) and came up with many of the key ideas that comprise the story.  Plus, Dick Sherman plays the kazoo in the penguin scene.<br /><br />FUN LINES FROM THE MOVIE<br /><br />Mrs. Banks:  I don't think we need bother the police dear.

Well that's debatable, I must say.<br />--<br /><br />Bert:  Now's the time Mary Poppins.  No one's lookin'.<br />--<br /><br />Mrs. Banks:  As a matter of fact, since you hired Mary Poppins, the most extraordinary thing seems to have come over the household.<br /><br />Mr. Banks:  Is that so?<br /><br />Mrs. Banks:  Take Ellen for instance.  She hasn't broken a dish all morning.<br /><br />Mr. Banks:  Really.  Well that is extraordinary.<br />--<br />--<br />NICE LITTLE TOUCHES<br /><br />Jane and Michael are usually made to speak ... alternatingly.

Somebody had to think of doing that, and it works nicely.<br /><br />After Mary Poppins returns the robin to the outdoors, she closes the cutains, and a slight breeze is then seen blowing the curtains inward.  A nice little touch.<br /><br />In the cartoon sequence, one of the baby swans is made to do a sort-of spazmatic little swim.  A nice touch, I think.<br /><br />After singing \\"Feed the Birds\\" Mary Poppins gently brushes the side of Jane's head.

B000001FKY|4.0|God i've listened to this cd so many times. I actually bought it a long time ago when i first heard PSSOM, but unfortunatly that was the only song i had listened to. I bought it a few years ago on cd, and fell in love with it. It really reminds me of how cool things used to be and how fun it was to be young without any responsibility. <br />Stand Out track include: <br />                        #3-Animal <br />                        #7-Gods of War <br />                        #9-Hysteria(my fav) <br />                        #11-Love and affection <br />Yeah sure \\"Love Bites\\" and \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" and all the other singles they released we're good, but the non-singles in my opinion are what makes the artist. Nobody ever mentions the rest of the cd and how good it is. <br />Def Leppard is a studio band, which means they're pretty crappy live or at least they were back in the drunken stupor days. <br />\\"Women\\" was their first single, but it pretty much sunk. Then they released \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\" which propelled them to an even bigger status than Pyromania. This album is classic and many of the 30-40 year old people that were teens back then will agree that Hysteria and Def Leppard provided the soundtrack to their lives and the 1980's forever more. Listening to this cd almost gives me chills, it reminds me of the summers of 87' and 88' when I used to go to Myrtle Beach.  <br /> <br />#7 Gods of War- This song is a friggin'epic. Reminds me of Sept. 11th. My fav. part is when Joe sings \\"On a countdown to Zero\\" <br /> <br />#8 Don't shoot shotgun- Not really a big deal, but I love the beginning when he says \\"Ru, Run, for cover, don't shoot shotgun\\" <br /> <br />#10 Hysteria- God i love this one. It's so beautiful. They really had a knack for melodies. Reminds me of my childhood, almost brings a tear to my eye, and I luv the part where he says \\"Get closer to me, bbbbbaaaabeeee'.  <br /> <br />#12 Love and affection- Not a single, but somehow this one grew on me, i like the guitar intro to this one, good outro type song.
B0002DB52M|4.0|I did not expect anything of this magnitude when I first saw Dogville. \\"Powerful\\" and \\"brilliant\\" are two words that are thrown around far too much in the movie business, but they truly do apply here. I would say it was beautiful as well, and while it did have some beautifully rendered scenes, there was a whole lot of ugliness in the film to really be described in this way. <br /> <br />Dogville is different than any movie I have ever seen. The whole town is nothing more than a few props placed on what seems to be a giant chalkboard on the ground with chalk outlines of the houses and other significant areas of the town. It takes place in the Rocky Mountains probably around the 1930's I would guess, however, you will not see anything scenic except for one lone bush (I'm not sure if that has any meaning or not, I'm sure there is all kinds of hidden messages here). I enjoyed this premise at first, then got slightly annoyed by it but at the end, I hardly noticed. Being able to see in and out of buildings as regular townsfolk get on with their lives was kind of nice background and in certain scenes, thought provoking. Who really knows what is going on behind the locked door right next to you? This alone makes the film very unique but it delivers more within the story, itself. <br /> <br />The story begins as Grace Mulligan (Nicole Kidman) is fleeing from something and is pretty frightened. She is caught coming through Dogville by Thomas Edison Jr. (Paul Bettany) and convinces Grace to stay in town after jumping through a few hoops with the people of the town (15 people comprise this small town). At first, Grace makes an effort to befriend the townspeople and gain their trust, and succeeds. After a bit of time, because of things that happen through no fault of her own, the town begins to turn on her. They realize that her choices are to be caught by the police, the gangsters after her or to remain in Dogville (I'm really paraphrasing here for the sake of space). Upon figuring that out, they turn very nasty towards her, in almost every way imaginable and the one person she trusts, Tom Edison, seems unable to help. As anyone watching will no doubt figure out, there is going to be a twist and it turns out to be a nice one. <br /> <br />I thought the movie was great, as mentioned above, but I do not think it was necessary to fill 3 hours and I thought the end could have been a little more... well, just more. They could have had some real fun there. Nicole Kidman and Paul Bettany turn in excellent performances and director Lars von Trier deserves some kudos as well. Good job by all!
0312263120|1.0|having read the da vinci code and being impressed by the apparent amount of background details, the digital fortress completely shattered my belief in dan brown's assiduousness in doing background research.  the inaccuracies/misconceptions in what the NSA does, in computer engineering, algorithms, cryptography, etc turned me off; the characters as caricatures of professors and researchers was the best anti-cialis i've come across in a while.
B000000W5H|4.0|This album is better than critics would have you think.  It's not as good as the \\"Big 4,\\" from Beggar's Banquet through Exile on Main Street, but it's still good, and certainly more consistently good than Goat's Head Soup.  The first track, If You Can't Rock Me, is a great way to start.  We've all heard Mick Jagger yell the lyrics before, but in this one you get to hear him scream them and get up there.  This one really rocks.  The Stones' cover of Aint Too Proud to Beg is another great song, showcasing their familiar (and welcome) attitude and Billy Preston's piano.  Then comes the title track, which may be (as another reviewer said) a virtual rewrite of T. Rex's Bang a Gong, but still rocks as hard as anything else.  The first 7 seconds alone are all-time classic rock and roll, before the vocals even come in.  Till the Next Goodbye is a really nice acoustic-based song, and is a nice departure from Mick's often aggressive lyrics.  Time Waits for No One is, I'll admit, a good song, but that's all I'll give it.  I just think it's really boring.  It goes on and on (kind of like the Stones themselves!) for more than its fair share.  The next song, Luxury, is abysmal and should never have been considered as a \\"good\\" idea.  Mick Jagger is not from Jamaica and should not sing as though he were.  However, Dance Little Sister can be played as loud as it wants, as far as I'm concerned.  This song has an extremely, EXCRUCIATINGLY simple one-chord riff on A, and it's brilliant.  Fits the mood of the album perfectly.  If You Really Want to be my Friend is a really nice gospel-type song.  It's similar in style to Let it Loose from Exile on Main Street, and is another heartfelt song like Till the Next Goodbye.  Short and Curlies is okay...but it sounds really immature.  It sounds pretty dorky and clich, but it's way better than Luxury.  The final track, Fingerprint File, is a masterpiece in all senses of the word.  This song could not be better.  This is a funk-style song, and it rocks way hard.  Listen to Keith's upstroke!  Listen to the chorus!  \\"It gets me dow-ow-ow-ow-ow-ow-own!\\"  Amazingly executed, this one is.  The mood change around 2 1/2 minutes into it is great, as is the ending, Mick's last stifled scream.  Is this album worth buying?  By all means, yes.  You just may want to program your cd player to skip, if nothing else, Luxury.  To put a timeframe in perspective, this album is close to Exile on Main Street in sound/style.  It would have fit perfectly coming right after that, maybe before it, instead of Goat's Head Soup.
0385510454|1.0|I have read all of Grisham's books, looked forward to this one.  However, I was sorely disappointed.  It was slow, I kept waiting for the story to happen, and I had to force myself to pick up the book and keep reading.  There was too much \\"travel brochure\\" and not enough of previous-style Grisham.  And the ending just left me hanging.   <br />The past couple books lead me to think that Grisham has \\"run dry.\\"  I long for the old days of THE CLIENT, THE FIRM, THE PARTNER, THE RUNAWAY JURY, etc.  I will probably read a future book by Grisham but I won't pay retail price for it.  I'll wait until I can pick up a copy in a thrift shop for $1.

B00064MW6A|1.0|Oh boy, where to start.  There were several big budget spectacles that got critically(and commercially)massacred  during 2004(VAN HELSING, ALEXANDER, etc.), but I'm sorry to say that none deserved said ravagings more than CATWOMAN, a pale, soulless attempt at refashioning the comic book heroine/villainess that fails miserably on so many levels that it's hard to know where to start with regard to placing blame.<br /><br />For one, I'm not sure what poor Halle Berry was thinking when she read the threadbare script--was it actually once-upon-a-time decent and at some point re-written into the careless,  sophomoric bird cage liner(or for that matter litterbox liner)that ultimately ended up on screen?  Nothing about the characters or story are fleshed out--there is absolutely no rooting value or any remote reason as to why we or anyone would care about these characters--any sympathy offered by the audience is strictly for the poor actors who had the misfortune of being led to believe that this was actually a workable script.  As such, Berry doesn't stand a chance in the title role, and her straining attempts to get some grasp of the character just reinforces the brilliance of Michelle Pfeiffer's definitive take on the character in BATMAN RETURNS(and makes one truly wish that the initial concept of a Catwoman film with Pfeiffer had actually seen fruition).  Unfortunately, Berry isn't the only one lost here--Benjamin Bratt surfaces in his upteenth role as the boyfriend/love interest/straight female-gay male eye candy and basically sleepwalks(again)through a role that actually doesn't require much more than that, while Lambert Wilson as one of the film's villains is about as convincing in the role as..well, Berry as Catwoman.  As for Sharon Stone, she's Sharon Stone--though prone to occasional bouts of very fine acting(CASINO, THE MUSE), she doesn't seem to be in on the joke that her role was meant to be more over-the-top and instead tries to play it serious.  Only Alex Borstein, as Berry's gal pal, seems to get that this is far from a work of art and is actually in on the joke--she's the life of this very dull party. And I won't even tary long on the poorly staged action sequences or the cheap looking CGI effects--when someone said that they looked just like those from the accompanying video game, that was actually an overstated compliment. Ultimately, I'm not sure what's more disheartening--the fact that a movie this bad actually got made, or that the studio heads actually thought that the movie was good.n, as Berry's gal pal, seems to get that this is far from a work of art and is actually in on the joke--she's the life of this very dull party.

B000002UAR|5.0|So why do so many people consider Revolver to be one of the best, if not THE best album of all time?  Why do so many critics and publications list it at the top?  After all, weren't the Beatles primarily a singles band, and most of their albums just collections of singles anyway?  How do you rate one Beatles album above another then?<br /><br />Well, speaking only for myself, it's Revolver's abundance of lesser-known and lesser-played classics (on the UK version) that make it stand out.  And while Abbey Road will always be my personal number one pick of all time, Revolver is undoubtedly number two for the Beatles, and on my personal all-time top ten list.<br /><br />Yes there are huge hits like \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" and \\"Yellow Submarine\\" here, but when was the last time your local oldies station played \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" or \\"For No One\\"?<br /><br />Everyone was at the top of their game here, as the Beatles almost always were, with each of the three songwriters coming up with some of their all-time best.  George Harrison's \\"Taxman\\" is as relevant today as it was back then, if not more.  \\"I Want to Tell You\\" is one of his best as well.  Paul McCartney's bravely romantic \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" is the kind of timeless standard that only he could pull off in the context of a rock band, while \\"For No One\\" was and is criminally ignored by the radio.  And please don't forget John Lennon's pure seminal power-pop on \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\" with some of the best harmonies ever recorded.  The coolest thing about this song is the way you can hear the band's joy at making such great music expressed in their voices and performance.  Just try not breaking into a wide smile at that magic moment when the harmony and John's vocal separate, one ascending and one descending, for a few bars.  Pure genius.  \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" was appropriately placed last, as their most forward thinking and psychedelic song yet was about to usher in a whole new era.<br /><br />\\"Doctor Robert\\" is my only skip-it track on this record.  I may rate Abbey Road higher than this, but that's like comparing 1 trillion dollars to 1.1 trillion.  Either way it's an embarrassment of riches and you really should have it!<br /><br />Waaay more than 5 stars.record.

B000002KIT|5.0|yes this is a great record though you need to check out producer's Tony Visconti's comments on this to get the full picture. Despite the \\"Live\\" tag in the title there are many studio overdubs on this recording. Only Brian Downey's drums were left as they were recorded. Still this is a highly energetic set of tunes that captures a great TL concert. I've seen plenty of them and this LP captures them at the pinnacle of their powers (in my opinion).  I think the version of Southbound on this record is far superior to the studio version (not that that was bad) and really rides high. As any TL fan should know it was customary in their live shows for them to pair the Cowboy Song with The Boys Are Back In Town and to this day its hard not to hear one without thinking of the other.  Live albums in the 70s were de rigeur though not all were of sufficient quality to justify release but this album , despite some studio doctoring, is excellent and won't disappoint anyone who enjoys straight a ahead rock. I recall seeing the tours from which this album was assembled and they were great. Actually they blew Queen off the stage a number of times and made Brian May look somewhat dainty in his playing. I respect BM and Queen but at this time TL was a freight train that could not be stopped. <br />RIP Phil.
B00022M518|5.0|Eno's first post-Roxy Music solo album, it was considered a really \\"out-there\\" and underground kind of record in it's day, which is kind of ironic today since most of Eno's little experiments in pop managed to have a tremendous influence on rock music as we now know it.<br /><br />The opening \\"Needles in the Camel's Eye\\" sounds to these ears like the very birth of \\"alternative\\" rock while \\"Blank Frank\\" was an influence on the later punk movement.  \\"On Some Faraway Beach\\" and the title track sound like the initial birth of Eno's later fascination with ambient music, another movement he spearheaded.<br /><br />I hope nobody out there is scared off of this CD by those stories that it has something to do with, er...deviant sex acts.  For one thing it's a few mumbled lyrics in just one song, the closing title number, that fuels that legend.  And secondly, I've always heard the lyrics as going along the lines of \\"they've nowhere to BE.\\"  My interpretation may not be everyone's but I tend to think this song had nothing to do with watersports but Eno coyly played along by not confirming or denying once the rumour started.<br /><br />Eno already had a lot of famous and talented friends when he made this record, so everone from King Crimson-ites John Wetton and Robert Fripp to the legendary Chris Spedding showed up to help out, along with all of his former Roxy Music mates save Brian Ferry.<br /><br />Eno's own voice and musical skills have never been exactly virtuoso level, but with him that's always been the point.  He used his studio expertise and outstanding taste in backing musicians to fashion one-of-a-kind collections of songs that are as wildly entertaining today as they were back then.  Eno's studio wizardry is well-served by the excellent remastering.<br /><br />Highest points: the insanely catchy nonsense of \\"Needles in the Camel's Eye,\\" Robert Fripp's controlled guitar meltdown on \\"Baby's on Fire,\\" the swooping title song and for me especially the beautiful and moving \\"On Some Faraway Beach.\\"<br /><br />I very much recommend this and all of the Eno reissues up to and including Ambient 4: On Land.iful and moving \\"On Some Faraway Beach.\\" <br /> <br />I very much recommend this and all of the Eno reissues up to and including Ambient 4: On Land.
B00004NJJQ|4.0|This is the one to get if you are starting to look at UFO's career. Obviously if you were a fan back in the day then you know that this is top shelf stuff so you probably don't need anyone to remind you of how influential this was at the time. People were talking about how killer Michael Schencker was which was true but I was equally as knocked out at how well they sounded as a band as opposed to some showy guitarist fronting a band. The songs worked and they rocked. Obviously the highlight of the record is \\"Rock Bottom\\" and for my money this is the only version I want to hear as I've never been thrilled with the endless noodling I've heard in various live versions.  I realize other UFO fans might disagree but in any case you cannot go wrong with buying this record.  I would suggest this above all other UFO studio albums (not that they are bad) because this is so good and captures the classic lineup so well.
B00000I8UK|5.0|Like his fellow woodwind visionary John Coltrane, Eric Dolphy left us far, far too soon.  Out to Lunch is one of his most famous recordings, and in my estimation one of the best jazz records ever.  His early death was truly a tragedy for the world of jazz and for all music in general.<br /><br />Dolphy played with a lot of the top musicians of his day, including 'Trane himself, but the combo assembled by Blue Note for this session was truly one for the ages: Freddie Hubbard, Bobby Hutcherson, Richard Davis and Tony Williams.  Put that team of all-stars together with Alfred Lion's usual flawless production and Dolphy's revolutionary explorations beyond the world of bop and you have one classic combination.<br /><br />Dolphy himself uses alto sax, flute and bass clarinet for a variety of timbres, while Hutcherson's artistic vibes work takes the place of the traditional piano.  The young and at the time barely-known Williams makes his mark while bassist extraordinaire Davis anchors the sound.  This is adventurous stuff here and requires quite a bit of serious attention to \\"get\\" it, but for those who make the journey, the rewards are plentiful.<br /><br />This music doesn't grab you out of the gate like a \\"Sidewinder\\" or a \\"Chitlins Con Carne.\\"  This wasn't Blue Note as purveyors of cool and catchy blues and soul jazz, but as documentors of the roots of the emerging avant-garde scene and the post-bop world of fusion and beyond.<br /><br />Years ago when I first heard Out to Lunch I just didn't get it until playing the title track for about the third time.  I suddenly became mesmerized by the vibes and then all at once I saw the entire logic and genius behind it.  This is avant-garde and intellectual music yet it is also earthy, musical and won't scare off the neighbors.<br /><br />If you're willing to give it some serious spins and let it grow on you, then bring out your inner beatnik and buy this CD.  A true classic.
B00005T7I1|5.0|Seriously, first off, if it was such a bad movie as some ignorant losers have suggested, then why was it a blockbuster at the box office? that's right. and you could say that most of the people in this world are stupid, but that is only excuse to cover up YOUR own stupidity. this is a great movie, so just deal with it. <br /> <br />I like how this movie has those comic-like colors in it, it sets it alive as a comic-book movie actually. I never read the comics but I saw the movie and that was enough for me. True, Warren Beatty could have put a tad bit more emotion into this role, he comes off as all Steven Segal like, all calm for the most part and that sort of thing. Either way though, this film is badarse and it features a lot of villians such as (and I will describe them a bit so you know who they are) Flat Top (has a flat head), Itchy (scratches his neck), Influence (has a kind of sunken face), Pruneface (you will know him when you see him), Big Boy Caprice (ditto), The Blank (ditto), Mumbles (ditto) etc. Which who are, apparently villains from the comic books. Others from the comic books that are in this movie are Shoulders (has wide shoulders, The Brow (has a couple wide lines above his eyes), Rodent (you will know who he is when you see him), and Little Face (ditto) even though they appear for a couple of brief moments but still...Al Pacino is so great in this movie as Big Boy Caprice, one of his best roles since Scarface. And Madonna, wow..this movie was made back when she was hot. Now she is not of course. But she is so sexy in this movie it is kinda sad to see her in it, and then see her right now...oh well. <br /> <br />In short, this movie is worth buying.
B000063DFS|5.0|No More Tears (1991). Ozzy Osbourne's sixth studio album. <br /> <br />Prior to this album's release and all through the tour of No Rest For The Wicked(1988), Ozzy had literally gone through hell. Considering all of his problems that don't need to be addressed here, this was not a great time for Ozzy. But once all was fixed between everyone involved, he collaborated with Motorhead's Ian \\"Lemmy\\" Kilmister to write and produce Ozzy's first effort of the 90s. NMT is a bit more melodic than any Ozzy release up to that point as it does display some of the aftermath of Ozzy's ordeals, yet it still retains the signature Ozzy sound that we've all come to expect. Perhaps no other rock/metal star has had as many commercial comebacks as the Ozzman himself, and NMT's success verifies that. Many can agree that Ozzy isn't the best vocalist in the world, but no one can deny that his voice will grow on you over time, plus he has great songwriting abilities and he tends to surround himself with excellent musicians. The 1990/91 yearspan was the last real commercial success point for hardrock/metal in the USA and there were some excellent albums that popped out around that time. Guns N Roses had the Use Your Illusion albums, Metallica had the Black album, Judas Priest had Painkiller, and of course Ozzy had NMT. <br /> <br />Out of the blue, I felt like I needed to review this album because I had just rediscovered it not too long ago. When I first bought NMT several years ago, I thought it was a decent hardrock album, though nothing really special. I generally prefer some of Ozzy's earlier material, and to this day my favorites are still Bark At The Moon(1983) and NRFTW, but one day I lost this album and strangely felt the need to replace it as soon as possible. After finally listening to NMT again, I must say that I overlooked a great gem and I appreciate it now a lot more than I initially did.  <br /> <br />So what made me come back? It could've been the excellent production and thefact that Ozzy's third axeman Zakk Wylde just absolutely SHREDS here, but for the most part, I find that Ozzy just writes GREAT songs. If anything, I'd say that the songwriting ability on NMT is top notch and Ozzy's most consistent to date. I mean, it begins with not one, not two, but SEVEN stellar tracks which are all a blast to hear. You've got 'Mr. Tinkertrain', 'I Don't Want To Change The World', 'Desire', the title track, 'Hellraiser', 'A.V.H.' and 'S.I.N.' which are all equally amazing rockers. 'Mama I'm Comin' Home', 'Road To Nowhere', and 'Time After Time' are just the right kind of ballads for this album. I'd say that my absolute favorite songs on here are the midpaced rocker 'Desire', the pounding anthem 'IDWTCTW', and the greatest track of all 'No More Tears'. This slow paced masterpiece showcases the perfect combination of keyboards, guitar, bass, and melody. It even has a bit of progression towards the middle of the song followed by an astonishing lead by Zakk. I was a bit surprised to learn that this track was the last one written for the album, and the title was thrown on last minute! 'Zombie Stomp' is a good song instrumentally, albeit with some cheezy lyrics thrown in. Still, to consider that this is the weakest track is saying a lot because in reality there is no filler material to be found here. <br /> <br />Though the first few 2002 remastered Ozzy albums have been nothing but less than desirable due to the fact that the bass and drum parts were re-recorded, from NRFTW and on the albums have remained untouched. I'd say that of all the 2002 remasters, NMT is the one that you MUST buy because it has the greatest quality in terms of bonus tracks. You get the awesome B-side 'Don't Blame Me', and also the fast and goofy rocker 'Party With The Animals' which happened to be on the \\"Buffy The Vampire Movie Soundtrack\\". Both wrap up the album on a good note. <br /> <br />Replayability: Decent, whenever I need a quick Ozzy fix, or just feel like listeningto some good hardrock. <br /> <br />In the end, NMT is a great album that increases its appeal with much time and repeated listens. It's a recommened listen for first time Ozzy fans and is likely to appeal more to most people than most of his other releases have. Not the greatest album of his, but it would be a shame for you to ignore it.  <br /> <br />Other Recommendations: <br />-Any of the previous Ozzy albums (The more recent albums Ozzmosis(1995) and Down To Earth(2001) were disappointing for the most part) <br />-'Appetite For Destruction' by Guns N Roses <br />-'Metallica' by Metallica
0807205613|5.0|Once again, Garth Nix has been able to conjure up a marvelous novel. Like it's sequels, Sabriel and Lirael, Abhorsen keeps its reader hooked and always wanting more. The plot developes quickly and there is never a dull moment as you read. It is, indeed, difficult to put the book down. The series itself is quite addicting-- after reading the prolouge of Sabriel, I immediately logged on to Amazon.com and ordered its sequels. <br />Although its ending had been abrupt, I didn't mind too much when I discovered that its sequel, Across the Wall: Tales of the Old Kingdom and Beyond, would be released July 2005. I only wish it weren't so far away, but I'm sure it will be worth the wait! <br />Overall, it is INDEED a captivating novel~ Although I'm not much of a book-buyer, the Old Kingdom Trilogy has been proven to be worth the price. :] in other words, I LOVE IT. GO READ IT.
B0002Y4TZG|5.0|Sorry, but I still have my double album (that's right, on vinyl) copy of 'London Calling'. And this ain't it. I also bought a couple of previous re-issues on CD. If you also did, save some money and skip this one. Don't buy this just to get the DVD, either. Get yourself a copy of 'The Essential Clash', or even better, 'Westway to the World'. Joe's estate may be making money on this, but it doesn't need yours.
0060005424|5.0|I'm just so glad I started reading the series this year (2004-2005). The poor readers who read Sabriel when it was first published in 1996 had to wait FIVE YEARS for this wonderful sequel to be relased! <br />But anyway, onto the reveiw. Although I didn't find Lirael as captivating as Sabriel, it was still worth the read, and is definately worth a second read! Although it takes a while for the actual plot to develop, Lirael is filled with overwhelming information about Lirael, Prince Sameth, and the former Abhorsen-- information that leaves its readers with more questions then answers, as it is with all important discoveries! <br />Thankfully, most of these questions are answered in its sequel, Abhorsen. :]
B0001NBMBC|5.0|People have already mentioned that this is a more matured, rock version of Slipknot. Also, people have said that they are a sellout. I want to tell you it isn't true. This band is full of talent, and this album proves it. Here is a short review of the songs and a rating on a 1 to 5 scale. <br /> <br />Prelude 3.0 - I'm gonna say that this is just another of their crazy openings, but it is better than the other ones on \\"Slipknot\\" and \\"Iowa.\\" *** <br /> <br />The Blister Exists - Drumming is all I need to say. Joey must be one of the most crazy, and talented, drummers in the world. He is awesome. The guitar is pretty good, but not as good as in the other songs. Can you feel this? **** <br /> <br />Three Nil - Should be the best song on the album. It's heavy, loud, and fast. Pure Slipknot right here. It's already skipping on my cd, and I just got it last week. If your gonna buy this album for one song, make sure it's this one. One, Two, Three, NIIIIL!  *****  <br /> <br />Duality - Duality is one of the better songs on this album. It shows a more of a \\"rock\\" side of Slipknot, like Vermillion. It has some pretty good guitar and drums as well. I push my fingers into my eyes... **** 1/2 <br /> <br />Opium of the People - Pretty decent song, with an awesome opening. The guitar is pretty awesome, Mick and Jim do a sweet job with it. Corey sounds good too, as always. **** <br /> <br />Circle - Uh, really soft, with a weird opening, but the guitar gets pretty good, for a soft Slipknot song. I really never listen to it too much. I've listened a few times though, enough to give it a rating. *** <br /> <br />Welcome - Really heavy, and the drumming saves it from being bad. The drumming is phenomenal in this song, in my opinion. <br />*** <br /> <br />Vermillion - Okay song, pretty weird though. The guitars and drumming are nothing too spectacular, but they aren't bad either. I never listen to this one either. I actually listen to part 2 more. *** <br /> <br />Pulse of the Maggots - I've never seen such an awesome tribute song dedicated to us fans (maggots) as this one. It sounds similar to a Metallica song mixed up with the Slipknot tone. I love the intro. This is the year, where hope fails you... ***** <br /> <br />Before I Forget - I guess you could call this one underrated, since I never hear too much about it. It is a pretty awesome song though, with really good guitars and drums, again. The lyrics are pretty heavy too. I really like the chorus too. **** <br /> <br />Vermillion Pt. 2 - If you were to compare this song to Circle, then this one would definately win, even though it is a love song...by Slipknot. The vocals are pretty awesome though. ****  <br /> <br />The Nameless - Really fast, with some turntables.  Probably the fastest song, drum-wise, on the album, and the vocals are back and forth. Get's slow, then bursts back in your face. *** 1/2 <br /> <br />The Virus of Life - I don't know what to say about this one, unless you want to call it circus music with some guitar and random turntables. Good song to go crazy to. It's okay though, I guess. *** <br /> <br />Danger - Keep Away - Really awkward. We do feel alone...We do feel alone. I like the guitar though, it's pretty awesome.  <br />*** 1/2 <br /> <br />Anyways, all the songs go from decent to straight up awesome. I would like to see you call Slipknot a sellout after listening to the sheer brilliance that is Three Nil.
0064471837|5.0|Five stars are not enough. I'd give it a thousand if I could! But since I am limited to only five, I suppose five will have to do. :)<br />Sabriel manages to take its readers into a deep unknown world, so unlike the other fantasy worlds we've visited so many times in different books. Sabriel is an original. It is purely the idea of Garth Nix and no other. It would be difficult to find another fantasy novel such as this. Sabriel carries no similarities to that of Harry Potter or Lord of the Rings, therefore making each new page and chapter a new and interesting read. The language itself is graceful and descriptive, making it superior to all other fatasty novels I have read.<br />Sabriel is a modern fantasy classic that can be enjoyed by all readers, both the young and old.
B0006399FS|1.0|I draw the line: it doesn't matter the album. It's all just a pumpin' three-minute radio-friendly commerials. That's all. 'take a look at Bono's glasses !!', 'what an amazing video !!', 'U2's back to ROCK !!'. U2 know the formula: Just a first hit single and they'll have millions of brianwashed posers buying the album just for that song alone. Light music for light people.     The album itself is irrelevant for every one. U2 IS THE GAME, not the album. Yet some fans are happy -specially youngest ones- because they'll have their chance see U2 live, because they want to tell the story to their friends later. 'I attended to a U2 concert this year !!!', nevermind the album itself nor the concert itself. It's just that. They MUST experience U2, otherwise they won't have stories to tell. Do you know what I'm talking about. They MUST experience every new album and every new tour from now on, because they were too young to catch U2 at Zoo Tv or Pop Mart, so they want to be a part of the game now.  How they wish they were us, because we were direct witnesses of the Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby and Pop times.    Let's talk about the album itself:    First of all, it's more of the same cockie, mainstream. Nobody can deny that. If someone deny it, that fan is blinded by his/her devotion. Easily forgettable, this album is just 'hit and miss'. Is there any art here ? No. Is there any experimentation here?  is this something NEW?. No, a U2 dimished to their lowest artistic level ever. Predictable songs, boring, pointless, self indulgent, trademarked, as well production.  Bono sings as horrible as he can, nevertheless he likes his own voice.     The apathy and lack of interest are present in each aspect of the disc. It's just a failed attempt to re-create the cutting edge sounds of their previous work All That You Can't Leave Behind. A commercialist disgrace. Moreover, the hype that was spread by the propaganda factory and the mass media really annoyed most of U2 fans. They must have all smoked a large amount of crack cocaine before listening to this album, thus being able to declare it a 'return to their roots' or an 'amazing rock album.' In case you don't know, only 3 songs are 'rock', all them crappy filler and silly. The rest are the used ballads and mid tempo numbers, a musical turd.    U2 have lost completely all sense of innovation. I'm embarrassed for them, really. I can't believe they're afraid of change. This sell out band have no more focus or hunger. U2 disrespect their craft and fans with products such as these. GO HOME.
B000059Z8M|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my 4 year old daughter. She calls it \\"Jessie the yodeling cowgirl movie\\" . It is a very cute movie and all the characters are great. I would recommend it to anyone who liked the first one.  Sequel's are not usually as good as the first but this movie is just as good, maybe better.
B00003CXB4|5.0|The Lion King is probably on of the best animated movies of all time. Every since this movie first came out in 1994, Disney hasn't been able to make a movie as good as it. A lot of reviewers have said that this is the most unfunny movie of all time. I have to disagree. Timon and Pumbaa were hilarious and besides, not all movies are ment to be funny.<br /><br />This Platinum addition is loaded with bonus features and extras. From Deleted Scenes to Timon & Pumbaa's Vitual Safari, there is so much to see, hear, and do. Did I mention that there is an all-new song called \\"Morning Report\\". It is a pretty good song, but not as good as some of the other songs of course!<br /><br />For those of you that have not seen the Lion King before, I will give a quick summary of the movie. A young, feisty lion cub named Simba is eager to grow up and become king. But Scar, Mufasa's evil brother and Simba's uncle wants to become king. But when Simba was born, Scar is no longer first in line. After Mufasa's tragic death, Simba is banished from the pridelands by Scar, who blames him for Mufasa's death. Simba spends many months in the jungle with his newfound friends, Timon & Pumbaa. He has forgotten who he really is and it will take some help from his childhood friend, Nala, to help him reclame his spot in the \\"Circle of Life\\".<br /><br />If you don't have a chance to pick up the whole Lion King trilogy before they all go back in the Disney vault on January 31, be sure to pick up this wonderful movie. DON'T MISS OUT!!!!
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I love zombie movies so I had to see this one. When the guy hits a zombie in the head with a tennis ball I was on the floor laughing! Or when the girl uses her boyfriend's severed leg to fight the zombies I about wet myself! I did find the scene where the guy has to shoot his mom to be disturbing but it's a black comedy. I loved it!
0684803356|4.0|Author Ernest Hemingway spared little in this searing look at the Spanish Civil War.  Readers see that hatred, loyalty, doubt, atrocity, ideals, and emotional wear were all part of this tragic conflict.  The story centers on American volunteer Robert Jordan and his anti-fascist comrades, a band of Spanish Loyalist guerillas operating in the hills behind enemy lines in 1937.  Jordan is planning to blow up a Fascist-held bridge as part of an upcoming Loyalist/Republican offensive.  His comrades include Pablo, a once-dependable leader now unstable and sick of war, Pilar, a woman of remarkable fiber, and Maria, a victim of fascist atrocities with whom Jordan falls in love.  These guerillas hide in the hills while Hitler's bombers fly overhead helping the fascists.  Readers learn of atrocities committed by both sides, and see that ideals can die along with those that fall in battle.   <br /> <br />This 1940 novel makes a powerful statement, despite losing some effect from Hemingway's wordiness and too-lengthy descriptions.  Despite this flaw, readers see the cruelties of war, and sense the author's heartsickness at this dreadful conflict.         <br />
B00064MW6A|3.0|First of all, I went into this movie with incredibly low expectations after hearing all the dreadful reviews and Roger Ebert putting it on his list of the worst movies of 2004. So that in mind, I was able to find things I liked about Catwoman. The movie is nice to look at. Catwoman bouncing off the walls was enjoyable to watch. She was sort of like a female Spider-Man. The colors and the sets were all done very well. So that's where my praise for this movie stops. I was really amazed at how bad these actors could act. The actors didn't believe the lines they were speaking and it showed. It had to be some of the worst acting I've ever seen. The story is incredibly stupid. Beauty cream that turns people's skin to stone??? And why would the villain want to sell this much less USE it??? Did she know she'd be battling Catwoman one day? Or does she just want to feel like a brick? It's best not to think about these things. Turn your brain off and watch the movie. It might be able to hold your interest till the end.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|Despite what some hard to please \\"so called\\" fans might have written  this album has some great material. I have followed this band closely since Images and Words first hit the shelves. The band has progressed very well over the years in my opinion ; not regressed.In order for a band to stay creative and fresh they MUST change things up a bit. Does this make the effort better or worse than previous material? I don't think so at all. The bands musical abilities Far exceed any other band I can think of preasently recording and not many ever. A certain 3 piece outfit from Canada does come to mind but they have not had a great effort in 20 years or at least since Signals. <br />Listening to or watching the new Live at Budakon may give some of you nay sayers a different opinion of the TOT album ; or it may not. But this is still one of top albums of the \\"New Millenium\\"
B000002B35|4.0|The claim to fame of Pulse, Pink Floyd's two-CD live album released in 1995, is the live performance of Dark Side of the Moon in its entirety.  If you're a casual Pink Floyd fan, that's great; if you're a devoted fan, you're apt to be disappointed by the lack of nuance expressed in a concert setting.  It has obviously been a few years since I listened to Pulse because my memory told me it was superior to 1988's Delicate Sound of Thunder live two-CD album - my memory was wrong.  I'm not saying Pulse isn't a quality performance or that fans won't enjoy it, but to my ears it clearly lacks the sort of passion and energy that was captured on Delicate Sounds of Thunder.  The two live albums of the reconstituted, post-Waters Pink Floyd share a number of songs in common, and I prefer the Thunder versions in almost every single case.  Here, the long instrumental sections of Shine on You Crazy Diamond, for example, seem to drag on interminably, while on Delicate Sound of Thunder each minute of the music built up toward a pressurized unleashing of vocals.<br /><br />The first disc features a healthy portion of material originating after Waters' acrimonious exit from the band.  There are two tracks from 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Region (Sorrow and Learning to Fly) and five from 1994's The Division Bell (What Do You Want from Me, A Great Day for Freedom, High Hopes, Keep Talking, and Coming Back to Life).  These are intermixed alongside some older Pink Floyd tracks: Shine on You Crazy Diamond from Wish You Were Here, Astronomy Domine from 1967's The Piper at the Gates, and two classic cuts from The Wall.  Another Brick in the Wall (Part Two) is good but seems to lack a little oomph, but Hey You is delivered with the passion and energy that make it easily the most impressive song on either of the Pulse CDs.<br /><br />Disc Two takes us through a complete version of Dark Side of the Moon; the live setting does take something away from the purity and magic of these songs, so your appreciation of the live set may depend upon the depth of your commitment to Pink Floyd itself.  Three tracks are added on at the end in the form of musical encores.  I have a feeling there would be rioting in the streets if Pink Floyd showed up and didn't play Wish You Were Here, Comfortably Numb, and Run Like Hell.  I was impressed by the first of these three classic songs, but Comfortably Numb and Run Like Hell seem to fall short of their counterparts on the earlier Distant Sound of Thunder.<br /><br />At first glance, Pulse looks like a no-brainer, a guarantee of musical nirvana courtesy of one of the greatest bands of all-time.  As I listened to it, though, I just felt as if something were missing - something subtle and comparatively minor, but noticeably missing all the same.  Still, this is Pink Floyd, and no Pink Floyd recording could ever be bad - but it seems to me that Pulse could have been more intense and musically dazzling than it is.of the live set may depend upon the depth of your commitment to Pink Floyd itself.

B0000CDLA7|5.0|I have one thing to say to the people who have panned this disc. Why don't you stick to garbage on the radio. I think this is a great cd. I like the hard edge of the disc. The only way to judge a disc is by that disc not by other discs they released. Every song on the disc is excellent. My favorite is In The Name of God. Whether you kids like it or not our tastes change with age. By the way this music does not sound like tool in my opion.
B000089RVX|3.0|After reading a handful of reviews, I feel I should leave my thoughts on this album (although I had bought it around the time it debuted).  It is a solid album, hence it definitely deserves at least 3 stars.  However, it fails to accomplish what other bands have been doing better.  The vocalist Amy Lee is only ok, as her vocals always sound muffled, as opposed to enunciated as any good singer would accomplish (i.e. Nightwish's Tarja Turunen) - such a muffled sound can make some of these songs sound very lethargic at times, which does not fit at all in this genre.  The piano in general is minimalistic, and the guitar playing is nothing overpowering, but fits well with the style.  Overall, the sound isn't bad, but could definitely use improvement - as for specifics, I think Bring Me to Life, Haunted, and My Immortal summarize this album's diversity, or lack thereof.  The arrangements are sub-par, and there are many dynamics missing that you would find in other bands such as Nightwish (the premier European goth metal/symphonic black metal/opera metal band - their arrangements are superb and to die for), Within Temptation (an extremely impressive goth metal band that brings out the alluring quality in the goth genre far better than Evanescence with a more talented soprano vocalist), and Sonata Arctica (an amazing heavy metal band that boasts of some of the best technical arrangements of any band).  While instrumental playing talent is one thing, arrangement is one of the most crucial elements to songwriting, and this band does not showcase this particular type of talent in this album. <br /> <br />In short, I would recommend Within Temptation's The Silent Force,  and Nightwish's Oceanborn over this album - they are superb the whole way through, and contain much more endearing songs, even with a good number of the non-metal persuasian.
044024157X|1.0|The murders are a bore and don't really get underway until the end of the book. No real narrative tension in this book. Grisham can't create original characters--they are mostly steriotypes.  The setting is also one that has been done often and better--by Grisham himself, for example

B000002HGD|5.0|This is one of my favorite Moby albums...it's after his really techno-y days, and before his newer work, so it's a nice mix of both.  <br />I love it!
B0002OERI0|5.0|I've been a fan of Green Day ever since their release of Dookie in 1994. I own every one of their albums, and I must say that this one has been the one that appealed to me the most. Whether you call it punk or not, the music is beautiful throughout the whole album. To anyone that critisizes Green Day for changing the style of their music to something so \\"unoriginal\\" and just because they don't sound as \\"Punk\\" as they might have in their earlier EPs, I believe should think twice before questioning the beauty of this album.  <br /> <br />The album is portrayed as a rock opera following a character who is referred to \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and his quest to find who he really is. Being influenced by the setting and the people around him, he goes through many changes until in the end, he ends up where he started. <br /> <br />Each song has its own mini genre and characteristics, and the thing that I love most about the album is how all the songs stand out from each other. <br /> <br />American Idiot - 7/10 - The album MUST NOT be judged on just this song, as it is by many people. It is really nothing special, it has a catchy chorus and BJA is obviously talking about how much he hates America and what it has become. This also provides a setting for the story that's about to unfold. <br /> <br />Jesus of Suburbia - 9.5/10 - This song is an epic. It is absolutely beautiful how BJA is able to sing so that you are able to tell that as the song progresses, Jesus of Suburbia's rage also increases. At the start he questions himself and his purpose, and by the end he hates everything and anything and runs away. Absolutely beautiful music rock/pop that has to be heard to believed.  <br /> <br />Holiday - 10/10 - My favourite single on the album. This song is obviously Bush Bashing, but aside from that fact, the beat and rhythm have to be one of the catchiest that Green Day have invented. TC's performance on the drums is outstanding. From the story's point of view, I think it should have been placed in 2nd not 3rd, as it helps to view the setting better. <br /> <br />Boulevard of Broken Dreams - 8/10 - Even though its probably going to be the most popular single from their album, I believe that even though it has amazing lyrics and some great beats, its a little slow and may start getting on your nerves after a while. Nevertheless, still a great song. By this point, Jesus of Suburbia is walking down the \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" away from his home to perhaps find a meaning to his life. <br /> <br />Are We The Waiting? - 7/10 - Even though its a pretty catchy song, it its rather repetative and gets boring too quickly. Your typical short Soft Rock song. It further elaborates on \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" <br /> <br />St. Jimmy - 9.5/10 - The only \\"Punk Rock\\" genre song on the album in my opinion, it is a fun song to listen to. BJA sounds great, as he explains Jesus of Suburbia's extraordinary transformation into St. Jimmy, who is literally a punk. WHen BJA sings \\"My name is St. Jimmy, I'm a son of a gun...\\" I really tend to lose myself in the music. One of Green Day's fastest paced songs ever. <br /> <br />Give Me Novacaine - 7/10 - Another slow rock song that explains that JoS/St. Jimmy is using drugs to stay \\"sane\\". Seems to drag on a bit, but the pre-chorus and chorus are extremely catchy and the guitars are used very well. <br /> <br />She's A Rebel - 7.5/10 - A fast paced rock song which surrounds a girl that JoS/St. Jimmy has met. He thinks that she may provide him with the revolution that he has been looking for for such a long time. Fun song to sing along too, yet nothing too special. <br /> <br />Extraordinary Girl - 6.5/10 - Probably my least liked song from the album, it sounds OK, but no seldom parts are catchy and you wouldn't usually find yourself singing along to it. This song is also dedicated to the girl he meets, but by this time him and her are probably going out. <br /> <br />Letterbomb - 9/10 - Your typical Green Day song. Amazing lyrics, beautiful music etc. \\"Whatsername\\" sends JoS/St. Jimmy a letter explaining to him why him and her can never be. He is dying on the inside and BJA is able to perfectly depict it in the chorus. \\"She says I can't take this place...\\" has the same effect on you as the part in the song \\"St. Jimmy\\" did. <br /> <br />Wake Me Up When September Ends - 8.5/10 - This song was actually written about how BJA felt when his own father died, but he was able to blend it in to go along with the story. VERY slow and sad, may capture the hearts of some listners, may drive away others. Personally I clicked with it. JoS/St. Jimmy is depressed on how he lost Whatsername. <br /> <br />Homecoming - 9/10 - Another 9 minute masterpiece, which is not as epic as Jesus of Suburbia, but it has many of its own moments. More of your typical Green Day music, much like \\"Letterbomb\\". TC's part I feel really was not needed as BJA was on a role. When BJA was singing \\"We're coming home again...\\" his voice is absolutely wonderful. In this chapter, JoS kills off St. Jimmy out of his head and becomes who he was before his revolution, and decides to make his way back home. <br /> <br />Whatsername - 9.5/10 - The first time I heard this song I actually sobbed. The start is kind of boring with minimal instruments and BJA sounds bored. When the guitar goes on full blast though, you can really feel the pain go through your veins, and you will react to it if you've ever had the same experience as JoS did. JoS is missing Whatsername greatly, and wonders where she is and what shes doing. They couldn't have finished the album off in a better way. <br /> <br />This album has changed my life with its absolutely music, lyrics, message. I usually can't sit through very long songs, without getting bored, but during the 2 ones off the album I never want them to stop, as I do not want the album to ever stop. <br />
B00005JNEI|3.0|Before starting my review, I should probably say that for the most part, I agree with Michael Moore's politics. I dislike president Bush and his regime, and think they have been very destructive in their first term (here's hoping the second term isn't so bad). That being said, Moore's controversial \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is a disappointingly mixed bag. Unlike \\"Roger and Me\\" or \\"Bowling for Columbine,\\" it's straight propoganda. Moore hits the audience over the head with his message, giving this reviewer a severe headache by the film's close. While Moore doesn't appear on camera as much as his previous films, his narration is near-constant - his narration combined with the endless news footage and documents gives this an irritating \\"slide show\\" or \\"court case\\" feeling. While Moore's previous films had interesting human stories, \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" gives us only the plight of Flint war mother Lila Lipscomb. Moore attempts some of his trademark pranking, but it's unsatisfactory (particularly in the awkward Patriot Act scene - a prank that peters out before a punchline). After a while, the film just gets dull. That being said, there is still plenty good to say about it - the scene where Lipscomb goes to capitol hill is undeniably moving, and much of the \\"found footage\\" (Bush in the classroom reading \\"My Pet Goat,\\" the unforgettable \\"Now watch this drive\\" scene) is great, and many of the individual scenes (the opening, homeland security) are well done. <br />The DVD has the film in its original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. Since a startling amount of this movie is grainy news footage, there really isn't much the DVD can (or should) do. Suffice to say, the image looks good enough. The real value of the DVD is in the extras. Some of the extras, especially the scene with Condelleza Rice (\\"I believe it was called 'Bin Laden Determined to Attack Inside the US'\\") and the documentary about Arab American comedians. The worst extra is about the release of the film, which is fifteen solid minutesof people saying what a great guy Michael Moore is - dull, dull, dull! Another extra worth checking out is the theatrical trailer, which is surprisingly effective.
B000002ITW|4.0|This live CD is an example of folk rock at its greatest.  The sound quality is almost perfect.  There is plenty of humor between the songs.  The rendition of \\"Teach Your Children\\" even sounds better than the studio version because the audience is included and there is not so much noise from the electric guitar.  I believe that more songs could have been included in this collection.  Some examples might include \\"Our House\\" and \\"Just a Song before I go.\\"  However, this recording is a great introduction to this group.
B000002MTR|5.0|In my opinion, the Chili Peppers best and last great album. The first thing that you notice about this album is the musicianship. Not since the days of Led Zep has a band produced a work as technically perfect as this. What do you expect when you combine Navarro ,the worlds best guitarist(apart from Bernard Butler of early Suede days) and Flea, the best bass player the world has ever seen? . The drumming is pretty awsome too, but apparently half of it was done by a session drummer rather than Chad Smith, but personally I dont notice any stylistic differences.But While the musicanship is exellent, it never takes precedent over the songwriting. Alot of people dont like this album, why?. Firstly,  yes it is very dark and depressing in places (which i think gives it character and honesty), and secondly, unlike the total rubbish found on Californication and By the Way, its not radio friendly pop that reveals all its charms immediately, but instead does what REAL music should do , grow on you after every listen, . I also think that the music is perhaps too psycadelic for some people and that the song structures are perhaps too complicated for some idiots (ie people who liked their last 2 albums) to get their heads around. This album also features a vocal preformance (Lyrics included) that I believe to be Anthony's best by far, in which he actually sings sweetly rather than raping perversly about his sexual escapades. Man getting Fruciante back was a huge mistake. Most Chili fans unjustly worship this guy and dis Navarro, I admit that what he did on BSSM was amazing, but his near death experience obviously had a profound effect on his guitar playing ability ( just watch how shodding his playing is on the Dvd Live At Slane Castle and you'll see what I mean). These days flea has dropped the bass histrionics  and just looks bored ( his only outlet being his stint with The Mars Volta). It seems that the Chili's trully creative days are behind them and the've instead opted forthe comfortable group dynamics (but poor musicianship) that fruciante brings to the fray.  a pitty, they were such a first rate band.  <br />I'm bored.... so heres how i'd rate all of the chili's albums to date !!! <br /> <br />RHCP 3/5 <br />Freaky styley 3/5 <br />Uplift mofo party plan 4/5 <br />Mothers milk 4/5 <br />BSSM 5/5 <br />One hot minute 5/5 <br />Californication 3/5 <br />By the Way 2/5
0694013013|5.0|It was a joy reading this to my two year old, who after a few times through, now knows the pictures so well she can recite the text all by herself.  I purchased this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas, and I'm completely happy I did.  We hope to expand our Eric Carle collection soon.  The stories are so easy for children to grasp (at least of the ones I have seen) and the illustrations are interesting and colorful.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|The man of the hour is only present in spirit, but what a strong spirit it is, so strong is the feeling that comes off this DVD that it stays, lingers & invites you back for more. If future generations ask what George Harrision & the Beatles were all about this DVD says it all!
1400032717|4.0|The first thing that called my atention about this book was its title....it seems different.  When I read that the rights have been sold to translate the book into 35 languages, I decided to give it a try.    The book, narated by a 15 year old autistic child, is unlike any other book I have ever read. The shock of being exposed to a different type of thought process and thus narrative, is absolutely overwhelming.    There are a lot of things you learn from Christopher Boone, and I went through the 250+ pages in very few hours.    If I were to describe the book in one word, it would have to be \\"crude\\".  It is really mindboggling to be exposed to autism, and to the extremely starightforward and single purposed mind of Christopher.    The book is truly one of a kind.    At times it made me angry, anxious, desperate, impatient.... A book that can transmit one of these emotions had fulfiled its purpose.  A book that generates such a turmoil of emotions and feelings is definitely worth reading.
B0002Z1EG2|3.0|How are we to judge Shania Twain?  As an artist of quality?  In that case, this review is pointless--I dislike writing negative reviews, and Shania herself has come out and said she only records songs so they will become hits.  I don't see the artistic quality in that.  But if we are judging her as an artist who knows exactly what her fans and critics wants, and delivers...then, ladies and gentlemen, Shania Twain is the best performer out there.<br /><br />There's something undeniably attractive in her voice, as you listen to these tracks (starting with \\"Forever and For Always\\" and working your way back to \\"Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under,\\" with only a few gaps in between).  Husband/producer/cowriter Mutt Lange certainly has an ear for a hit; and Twain's lyrics, while never the best in the world, are honest enough to appeal to the masses.  This is an album by a woman who knows where she stands in life and is happy with it; it is an album by a country artist with an undeniable pop edge (though new track \\"Don't\\", one of the best on here, has a more traditional appeal than her UP! and COME ON OVER material).  This is an album for Shania Twain fans, and those who wish to become fans.
B00003CXBK|4.0|An enchanting tale of demons, gods, humans, and the ultimate power of nature over all of them.  I loved the music and the action.  Lots of good fight scenes to be found here.  If you are a nature-loving anime fan then this is definately the movie for you.  I think the boar demon is a metaphor for the anger of spirits used to make hotdog meat.  Maybe that's just me...
0321146530|4.0|I had been curious about test driven development (TDD) for quite a while before I read this book. After reading it and seeing the results in my code and in the overall design of my projects, I was amazed that a set of techniques could improve quality by so much. <br /> <br />TDD development involves a totaly different mind set than traditional coding and requires some personal dicipline until the habits kick in. Thankfully, the author doesn't spend a lot of time convincing the reader how great this \\"newest fad\\" is but focuses on using TDD realisticly in your current practices. The results are well worth it. <br /> <br />The text mostly assumes you have access to one of the xUnit testing frameworks but at the end there is a whole section on developing your own testing framework. I was really puzzled at first as to why the author would include this section. The obvious answer is that perhaps there isn't a testing framework in your current development environment. After further thought I realized that TDD is a mindset. For instance I have intermittently used assertions and although TDD focuses on external testing of functons, I could use assertions to test assumptions about parameters passed into functions. Although the assertions wouldn't be as robust as the unit tests they would add to the overall quality. I don' know if I would have made that connection before.  <br /> <br />This is one of the more valuable books I have read. <br />
B00000GAIW|5.0|AQUALUNG is Jethro Tull's best CD ever. The lyrics are basically a rumination on how organized religion is supposedly just good for wars and other ills, and even though I don't agree with that theory, the performances here are hard to argue with. This is the first Tull CD you should buy.
0553573411|3.0|After reading all of the glowing reviews on this site as well as a cover quote from George RR Martin, I expected this series to be wonderfully intricate and darkly surprising.<br /><br />Unfortunately, while the series manages to create some interesting ideas, it is surprisingly slight for a book supposedly about an assassin.  For an assassin, the main character Fitz, seems remarkably unburdened with any truly unethical duties.  The \\"jobs\\" he performs are rarely morally ambiguous.<br /><br />There are few surprises in Royal Assassin.  The good guys are good from the start and can always be depended upon.  The bad guys are bad from the start and act in predictable ways.  Because of this, it's hard to reconcile some of the more foolish moves by the protagonists.<br /><br />I am still giving this book 3 stars because it really is better than most dreck out there.  The style is consistent and moving and the hero is likeable and easy to root for.<br /><br />One last bit, the title of this book should really have been Royal Beastmaster ;)
038073186X|4.0|This is a dark book.  Besides being a mystery, it is a psychological and spiritual thriller. Why spiritual?  Because for the second straight book, Lehane portrays a world that is scarred by Evil.  Yes, we're dealing with diminished capacity in some cases, but what do think those references to Auschwitz are about?  Why is the warden in the story?  Can one be insane and evil? Lehane does an excellent job creating a sense of foreboding that keeps you glued to the pages.  He draws on King Lear (going mad during a storm), film (the Wicker Man), and recent tragedies (Andrea Yates' killing of her children) to tell the story of Shutter Island.  I read this book in two nights because I had to find out what fate awaits our protagonist, Teddy Daniels.  Shutter Island is a horror story that goes to the depths of our being.
0060575816|5.0|I really loved this book.It was exelent with all the myterious characters like Touchstone,it's an awesome adventure with many twists and new challenges for Sabriel to overcome.I do have to admit though that they wouldn't stop runnig into the dead...it gets a little bit tyring after a while.I also think that the ending was a bit sudden...Touchstone and Sabriel don't even kiss at the end witch i thought was unusual(at the end of most books i read there is a looooooooooooong kiss at the end).And there was one part i could not understand,what was Touchstone really doing with the maid at the hotel that they stay at.But as i said before i loved all the characters...as specialy Touchstone because I'm a big fan of twin swordsmanship.I also like Mogget for his arogence.He was really funny but i preferd him as the cat not the firey monster thing.But all these things made up a great book in the end(at least i think so)and i loved it.Good job mister Nix a great accomplishment.
0553277472|5.0|This is my second reading of this classic.  The first was around '74 when I was actively reading various philosophies and trying to be a normal person.  Pirsig just blew me away with his wide-ranging scope and single-minded intensity.  ZAMM is a profound accomplishment on both a personal and philosophical level.  Phaedrus, a true lone wolf, an outrider by necessity, finally squared the circle and cracked the koan. <br /> <br />    Businessmen who work their way to wealth through shrewd dealing have many admirers.  Even more make heroes of athletes who robustly compete and win medals.  I respect Pirsig more.  He followed his mental compulsions to their denouement without assistance or thought of personal gain.  When some anonymous functionaries at Bozeman try to standardize his teaching, does he have a chat with the department head?  Well, of course not.  To Phaedrus, his classroom procedures bear the weight of the planet's collective wisedom.  He must justify what he does personally and professionally with the only response acceptable to him.  And that requires that the entire Western philosophical tradition be tweaked into concordance with the East.  The result is an amalgam that will please 1) the over-organized, rational engineers, 2) the spacey meditators seeking nirvana, 3) the spiritual who want God on High, 4) and especially the lone wolves of the mind. <br /> <br />    Pirsig is not just a philosopher.  By training and profession, he is also a rhetorician.  That means he presents his case with ability, drama and persuasion.  You may not hang on every word, but I can think of no other book that so dramatizes an intellectual battle. <br /> <br />    Of course he was insane.  Of course he treated people badly.  But the necessity of resolving such a conundrum is exigent in very few.  Fewer still come away with resolution, much less their sanity.  If you've ever been in Phaedrus' pack, read this book.  The indelible impressions from 30 years are still with me.
B000002UW1|5.0|And I LOVE R.E.M. With \\"Document\\" REM produced back to back classics. \\"Life's Rich Pagent\\" was one of the greatest albums ever. \\"Document\\" is the beginning of REM becoming more mainstream and more political, with songs such as 'Exhuming McCarthy' and 'Welcome to the Occupation' 'Disturbance at the Herron House' REM speaks on the injustices and outrages they see within both the government and the American people. With the popularity of the song \\"The End of the world\\" REM garnered much radio play, the benefit of which is oft debated by REM diehards. Did popularity and radio play ruin one of the greatest bands ever?? Unfortunately, I believe it did. Mainstreaming ones music is NEVER beneficial (except to the bands bank accounts). 'Document\\" I believe is the last truly great REM album. Every song on here is great, and the production is FLAWLESS. As on \\"Life's Rich Pagent\\" lead singer Michael Stipes voice comes throug loud and clear, perhaps even better on \\"Document\\" than on \\"Pagent\\". No longer is he drowned out by the bass guitar or the drums. Apparently he has decided that yes, he really DOES have something important to say and that we the listener should be able to decipher these little jewels of wisdom. This was my favorite album for about 3 years. With the release of \\"Green\\" REM became too popular for me and I felt the quality of their music suffered, radio uber-friendly 'Stand' being a perfect example of this. They even released a really bad \\"pop\\" like video. I wanted to vomit. REM videos up to this point were rare (I had to actually purchase a VHS !! tape of them and watch it repeatedly. The name of this tape slips my mind, and it was purchsed back in 1988 or so). If you're a new fan trying to get into REM, I really recommend you buy \\"Life's Rich Pagent\\" and \\"Document\\" and then work your way around their vast collection from there.  This is a really great piece of work.
B00006F83Y|5.0|Bold and brash, Songs for the Deaf announces itself, with unmistakable bombast, like the rock record to save rock records.  On its opening track, with a sly take on LA and American radio (\\"KLON, Clone Radio\\"), that launches into \\"You Think I Ain't Worth a Dollar But I Think I'm a Millionaire,\\" a zippy, propulsive jet engine of a song with an anthemic cry of \\"Give it to me, give it some more!\\"  It sounds like the lost Metallica ripoff never to have hit the shelves, but Songs for the Deaf proves to be twice as clever, twice as seductive, and twice as entertaining.  How did everyone miss the effortless rock masterpiece this was?  It's a question for the rock ages - songs like \\"God Is In The Radio\\" and \\"Song for the Dead\\" seem like they should be sitting atop every hard rock playlist for the rest of time.
B0002858YS|3.0|The Killers have produced a nice debut with \\"Hot Fuss.\\" Although it is nothing new, I suppose its good there is a resurgence of this type of music than other types. New-wave? Pretty much 100% new-wave. That's the problem, its an exploration in this style - not outside of this style - not pushing the envelope. This said there are some high quality and original tracks on this record, like \\"Mr Brightside\\" and \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is a fine example of a pop single. However, the vocals on the remainder of the album just don't exite me at all. Dare I say, the vocals of Flower's border on the brink of boring in some tracks, just like some tracks lack intensity. <br /> <br />However, it is a debut. Improvement is possible and probable.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I'll keep it short as other reviewers have said it all before me. I loved this movie. A simple story of everyday normal people dealing with the fact that the dead are coming back to life and how it affects their everyday lives. I almost didn't go to see this as I thought it was going to be a spoof of the original Dawn Of The Dead, which I didn't like or its Hollywood remake which I did like, released at the same time in Europe. Happily I found out that the only thing it had in common with those films was a similar title and loads of zombies. Probably the funniest film I've seen in a long time that's actually made me laugh. As it happens I saw this in Canada and was at times during it, the only one laughing!! Who hasn't had a strawberry cornetto to ease the pain of a bad hangover. With Dog Soldiers, Deathwatch, 28 Days Later and now Shaun Of The Dead, perhaps Hollywood should kept an eye on British film makers who can produce excellent and original horror movies with a fraction of the big budgets Hollywood pumps into all it's current horror remakes.
B00005NB0H|5.0|First of all, a couple of (in the grand scheme of things) minor complaints: <br /> <br />1) This is the third reissue of LIVE AT LEEDS on CD. The original CD version had the same six tracks as the LP version. The 1995 reissue contained all the songs from this show except for TOMMY (though it did include \\"Amazing Journey\\" and \\"Sparks\\" from that version of the show). Finally, in 2001, MCA released a (basically) complete version of the show. (Previous to this, the only way to hear the entire show was on the LIVE AT LEEDS COMPLETE bootleg.) My question is this: why wasn't the complete show put out the first time LAL was issued on CD? MCA couldn't be trying to fleece us loyal Who fans, could they? <br /> <br />2) The songs are not in the order in which they were originally performed. The correct running order is as follows: \\"Heaven and Hell\\" through \\"A Quick One, While He's Away\\", followed by the TOMMY section (\\"Overture\\" through \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\"), followed by \\"Summertime Blues\\" through \\"Magic Bus\\". This doesn't really bother me that much; if it bothers you, you can always program your CD player to play the songs in the correct running order, or burn a couple of CDs with the songs in the correct order. <br /> <br />Complaints aside, I have to say this reissue is pretty great. If you haven't heard any of this show before, you've missed out on what is probably (sorry, Deadheads; sorry, Springsteen fans) the finest professionally-recorded rock concert ever. Although I've heard the boys play more fiery renditions of TOMMY (e.g., the Woodstock and 8/29/70 Isle of Wight performances), this show continues to mesmerize after literally hundreds of listens, particularly \\"Shakin' All Over\\" and the jaw-dropping \\"My Generation\\" medley. Performance-wise, this is as good as it gets. <br /> <br />The remix, then. I've heard some complaints about this, but it sounds just fine to me - a slightly more trebly, more echoey version of the remix on the 1995 reissue. Rog, Pete, and John remain clearly audible, and you can actually hear Keith (particularly his fantastic cymbal work) a little bit better than you could on previous mixes. Some of the tracks on the second disc sound slightly out-of-phase, but this probably couldn't be helped - these tapes were 31 years old when they were remixed, and time tends not to be kind to old analog recordings. <br /> <br />Another bonus of the Deluxe edition is hearing the unedited between-song stage patter - the unexpurgated introduction to \\"A Quick One\\" is hilarious. <br /> <br />In sum, if you're thinking about buying this one, do it - although it's significantly pricier than the single-disc 1995 reissue, I think it's more than worth the extra expense. Unless you're ridiculously nit-picky (or really hate TOMMY), I doubt you'll be disappointed.
B00009Y3SA|1.0|The Touchstone comedy entitled THE HOT CHICK (2002) is an ugly and uninspired lump of less-than-interesting characters, a formulaic plot, sloshy sentimentality, and overplayed, raunchy humor.     I kept thinking, \\"I can't believe they made a movie about this.\\"    We have two `magic' earings; when two different persons put them on, they swap bodies. With that, we require very little effort to figure out where the story will go. Meet Jessica (Rachel McAdams): a popular but snobbish high school girl. She likes strolling around with her girlfriends. Enter Clive (Rob Schneider): a low-living dudd who has little going for him. And so, as it happens, Clive mugs Jessica. Man, and chick, put on earrings, thus switching forms. Man and chick must reacquire their original bodies. That's it.    At no point did I begin to care for the characters. Maybe that's because the story's basic problem - to say nothing yet of the way it was played off - is so ludicrous that it renders any serious overtones nearly entirely overlookable. Adding to that problem is the relentlessly juvenile quality of the comedy, that begs us, on hands and knees, to take next to nothing seriously. So absolutely silly - and sustained - is this humor that, when the usual moment to promote a couple serious elements arrives, the movie shifts into a misplaced moralizing tone, toting that \\"inner beauty\\" line after already implying that the outside package is King. And this behind a wake of sex-ploitation ad nauseum.    The chick may have been hot, but this film is not.
B000056NX5|5.0|I've been a fan of JCS since I saw the live stage version as a child in Boston (a very long time ago).  I am one of the \\"die hard\\" fans that loved the screen version from the 70's, wearing out three VHS tapes of it.  This version, however, grabbed me by the throat and demanded my attention.  This latest version of JCS is no slouch by any means.  This latest version is modernized and updated for the modern times, and is far more gritty and realistic when compared with the 1970's version. <br /> <br />The use of a stage as the main set of the video actually works quite well.  Costumes are spectacular, as is the camera and lighting work.  The story line is more clearly defined as an examination of the relationship between Jesus (Glenn Carter), Judas (Jerome Pradon), and Mary (Renee Castle), and the dynamics involved.  The Romans, particularly Pilate (Fred Johanson), are far more frightening characters, as is Herod (Rik Mayall).  The Romans are no longer portrayed as innocent bystanders in this version, and the Trial before Pilate is far more violent (Carter in reality is injured during the production of this scene).  While not anywhere near the violent level of \\"The Passion of the Christ,\\" you may wish to consider whether this one is appropriate for younger viewers. <br /> <br />If you like the 1973 video version of JCS, you'll love this one.
0449002632|3.0|London is my favorite city, and I'm partial to anything even remotely connected with it.  And I love history.  Therefore, I did enjoy this book.  \\"Enjoyed\\"--not \\"moved by\\" or \\"enlightened by.\\" <br /> <br />It really is just a much more polished and erudite \\"beach read\\"--not a major novel by any means. <br /> <br />But a very enjoyable one, a good chance to while away a few weeks of spare time without having to think too much.  A hamburger, not a steak--but a good hamburger.
0140042520|5.0|I think that The Dharma Bums is probably Kerouac's best novel. It has all the exitement and electricity of On the Road, plus a lot of Buddhist instrospection and meditation. This is Kerouac at his best. He had mastered his craft, and had yet to slip into alcoholism and self destruction. In fact Kerouac does have a sweetness and innocence and a love of life, of nature, of dharma; and it makes me sad to think of what became of him later. One might get the wrong idea about Buddhism. Kerouac and his buddies spend a lot of time drinking wine and smoking tea which really doesn't go very well with Buddhist practice. But they were truly pioneers as there were very few Buddhist teachers and no Buddhist practice centers in the US. They either had to invent their own form of Buddhism (as Kerouac did) or go to Asia. One thing this book has in common with On the Road is that it does involve a lot of travel. He journeys northward from southern California to San Francisco in a boxcar. Then travels across country to stay with his sister in North Carolina where he meditates and prays in the woods. And the book closes with a journey north to Washington state instead of south the Mexico as On The Road does. Instead of Neal Cassady we have Gary Snyder as Kerouac's friend. Finally, after a series of adventures in the bay area and on a back packing trip with a character whom I believe is based on Kerouac's friend Philip Whalen, Snyder departs for a zen monestary in Japan (he wouldn't return from Asia until the mid sixties and the two friends never saw each other again). Its a bit ironic that Allen Ginsburg (Goldberg in the novel) was initially skeptical of the Buddhist teachings but later became more devoted to it than Kerouac, becoming a diciple of the Tibetan teacher Chogyam Trungpa. Whalen became a zen priest and lived for years at the San Francisco Zen Center. But this was Kerouac at his peak. His most blissful and holy. His golden dream of life in the Buddhalands.
6303566448|5.0|Re-Animator has to be the best horror movie of the 80s next to Evil Dead. The movie has tons of gruesome special effect to spare with a classic scene involving a head and a woman. A nerdy scientist brings back the dead corpses with a neon-like liquid in a needle causing them to turn into zombies and then the fun starts when the scientist re-animates a dead cat and the cat comes back and that scene is hilarious and the classic scene with the severed head and the woman strapped to the woman is so outrageous that it is so hilarious. The gruesome stuff in the movie is a man's head is decapitated with a shovel,eyeballs being exploded,a dead man's head being peeled so you could see the skull. Though it is the best horror movie, it isn't really recommended for squeamish viewers. Also recommended:Dawn of the Dead(1978),Dead Alive,The Toxic Avenger part 1 and 3,Evil Dead 1 and 2,Zombie(aka Zombi or Zombi 2),and Basket Case.
0679457607|5.0|There is a reason why this book has sold so many copies.  This is because it is a great book on the mental side of golf.  This book does help with realizing why we sabotage ourselves in certain situations on the golf course.  This made me realize what I was doing and thus got rid of doing such negative thinking.  I also recommend \\"The Ultimate Golf Instruction Guide: Key Techniques for Becoming a Zero Handicap Golfer or Better.\\" ISBN; 1933023090.  This last book has great golf instruction technique that is very helpful.  The Ultimate Golf Instruciton Guide showed me how to lower my score by several strokes in a couple of months through sound technique that is not a copy of the same stuff that has been on the market way too long. I'm also hitting more greens in regulation than ever.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I'm not going to write a book here but I'll put in my two sense. I'll be the first to admit that the Napoleon Dynamite quoting craze is getting a bit ridiculous, but why not, there are more classic quotes in this movie then one mind could possibly think of. I've read alot of the negative reviews for this movie and I totally understand most of them. ND is not for everyone. Especially if you need comedy shoved down your throat. It moves quite slow and has no real plot at all but taht is also what makes this movie great. Its like no other comedy that has ever come out.  <br />The characters first of all is what makes this movie great. All i was thinking the first time i saw this movie was Where in the hell did they find the actors to play these characters? Every character is so funny in their own way it's hard to choose a favorite. My personal favorite is Lyle, the old Idaho farmer. The script of this movie and the way the lines are delivered from the actors is also esquisite. This movie are contains alot of physical comedy taht makes it great.  Deb runnign across the yard, Uncle rico making videos of himself, napoleon all sweaty drinking the energy drink, napoleon taking the VOTE FOR SUMMER button and chucking it down the hall, the principal bobbing his head during Summer's skit, the stupid look on coolguy Don's face the whole movie, ND flapping his hands during the Happy Hands Club presentation etc. the list goes on and on. I also love how the story all pulls together in the end with napoleon learning to dance then using his \\"skills\\" to help Pedro win the election and then Napoleon finally finding someone to play tetherball with him. And the dance scene i think will go down in history as an alltime classic scene. What alos made that scene enjoyable is if a nerd like ND would have danced like that at my  high school we would have given him the same standing ovation. <br />The music in the movie also pulls it together quite well. The cyndi lauper song at the school dance scene is awesome and so is the acoustic song after the ND dance scene. My favorite though is the song played at the end when ND and Deb are playing tetherball. Kip's song after the credits is awesome Too. <br /> <br />All in all Napoleon Dynamite really is a hero taht is hard not to fall in love with. <br /> <br />\\"You got like three feet of air that time.\\" <br />
B00018D44U|5.0|I just don't understand how some prople reviewing this CD can say that this is not good music. For me this is music at its best, it's unpretentious (unlike some other artists at the moment), decent and wholesome. Its sounds efortless, just as if Norah Jones had sat down at the piano or with a guitar and stared played some of her favorite songs. It's soufull and at times thoughtful while remaining simple.I am also pleased that she has been able to include some country undertones in the songs, that is obviously what has had am impression on Norah during her life; the duet with Dolly Parton is fantastic! A definate 5 stars.
B00005JNEW|5.0|\\"Friday Night Lights\\" is based on the acclaimed book \\"Friday Night Lights: A Town, a Team, and a Dream\\" by H.G. Bissinger, who happens to be director Peter Berg's cousin. In 1988, Bissinger followed the Permian Panthers, a high school football team and pride of the West Texas town of Odessa, through a tough season on and off the field. The citizens of Odessa hang their hopes and identity on their football team. Many men of the older generations wear State Championship rings that symbolize their lives' greatest accomplishment. The young Panthers are treated as celebrities. And they are expected to win. \\"Friday Night Lights\\" focuses on three young men: The reserved, anxious quarterback, Mike Winchell (Lucas Black), who must lead the team through tough times and take care of his needy mother. Cocky \\"Boobie\\" Miles (Derek Luke), the team's star running back and NFL hopeful. And Don Billingsley (Garrett Hedlund), a  running back with fumbling problems, whose alcoholic father (Tim McGraw), a former player himself, berates him for every small failure. The coach who is expected in no uncertain terms to lead the team to the State Championship was Gary Gaines (Billy Bob Thornton), a man who is reserved off the field, intense on it, and whose every decision is scrutinized by townspeople fixated on their team.<br /><br />\\"Friday Night Lights\\" will be remembered as one of the great sports movies. For football fans, it's a joy to watch. The Permian Panther's remarkable 1988 season exemplifies the excitement, the commitment, the pain, the thrills, and the anguish that make sports a universal attraction, if not an obsession. Emotionally captivating portrayals of the players suck the audience in. Billy Bob Thornton does a fantastic job of communicating consistently complex emotions in a man who speaks very little. The film's final game is one of the most riveting I've seen in a movie. According to director Peter Berg, 95% of the film was shot handheld, but the camera does not shake inappropriately. The candid depiction of characters at a significant time in their lives, the relationship of the town to the team, and the nail-biting suspense brought on by possibility of great success or equally great failure makes \\"Friday Night Lights\\" a wonderfully entertaining story with near-universal appeal.

B000002UAR|5.0|This is my favorite Beatles album. The content on this 14-track album is unbelievable. It covers so much of the Beatles finest work: a couple of love songs, psychedelic songs, feel good songs, and some gloomy songs as well. <br />My favorites are: <br />-Taxman  <br />-I'm Only Sleeping  <br />-Here, There and Everywhere  <br />-I Want to Tell You  <br />-Got to Get You into My Life  <br />-Tomorrow Never Knows
B00005JKC3|1.0|JUNK is the word to call this movie. Why? What's Jennifer Connelly doing in this movie? Eric Bana has no expressions on his face, it's like a test dummy. Nick Nolte... he could be one of the best actors in movie history, now he's one of the biggest fiascos in movie history. The night scenes are so dark you have to guess what's going on. The script seems to be made on a weekend, and worse yet, who had the idea to devide the screen in 4 arts? You can't concentrate in the movie. Why they made this movie? The T.V. series were much better.
B000002MK8|4.0|It really has surprised me when MTV really exceeded their expectations with the feel of their classic series MTV Unplugged. Yet, it is just a absolute shame that they haven't really been able to revamp that well recieved series that came out during the 80's and 90's. There are so many well accepted acts that have absolutely made great stripped doen performances including Nirvana, Elton John, L.L. Cool J, and the legendary Rod Stewart. During the early 90's Rod was on a double revived trail with his album Vagabond Heart, and his lovelife with his then wife Rachel Hunter. His appearance on MTV Unplugged really was the talk of the town.<br /><br />Rod Stewart's 1993 album Unplugged... and Seated is a very intimate live performance that really lets Rod's voice really excel and the songs as well. Most of the album reflects on Rod performing classic when he performed in the 70's. The songs here are very intimate here, and the feeling of the record also speaks very well, as one of Rod's best live performances. The highlights that are featured on this record include classic performances of standards like Maggie May, Reason To Believe, which became a hit nearly 20 years after Rod launched it to #1, a very wonderfully tearjerking version of Have I Told You Lately, Having A Party & one of Rod's boldest songs not featured on any of his studio albums, People Get Ready.<br /><br />Out of all of the live records that Rod Stewart has recorded, none of has been able to capture what Unplugged... and Seated has. For anybody who hasn't heard this record, it is well worth the listen. It is also a shame Rod hasn't released a live record since. This is a must have for any Rod Stewart fan.<br /><br />Album Cover: B<br /><br />Songs: B+<br /><br />Mastering: B<br /><br />Price: A-<br /><br />Overall: B+
B0001AP12G|5.0|First off I would like to say that rap isnt really my cup of tea. You can probably already tell this because i use expressions like \\"My Cup Of Tea\\" but i have to admit that when I first put this record in the player i was blown away. The disc starts out with the funny skit \\"Intro\\" wich leads into the best track on the album \\"We Dont Care\\" which is a powerful ode to drug dealing in the streets wich makes a powerful statement by having small children sing the verse \\"And all my people that are Drug dealing just to get by,stack ya money till it gets sky high\\" a powerful definition to life on the streets. \\"Graduation Day\\" which is a weaker track on the album but has a very good techno singing track added to it, next comes \\"All Falls Down\\" an excellent ode to self conciousness and the trouble of life that features a sample of Lauren Hill that blends perfectly with the acousic bass strums of \\"All Falls Down\\". \\"I'll Fly Away\\" follows with gospel feel that trancends into the next track \\"Spaceship\\" a harmonical vocaled, smooth rhymed masterpiece about the stress of superstardom and work. \\"Jesus Walks\\", possibly the most influential and best song of the album, comes with a vengance as Kanye raps about the toughness of life on the streets that tempts and tears someone apart and the only one that can save you is Jesus as portrayed in this God-Fearing masterpiece. \\"Never Let Me Down\\"  which features Jay-Z is possibly one of the smoothest sailed rap songs I have ever heard with a beautifly sung chourus and fast, clean rhyming straight from the microphone. \\"Get 'Em High\\" which is my least favorite song of the album, is a stereotypical pot loving rap flow that has good beats but is too common for me to really appreciate. \\"Workout Plan\\" is another pretty funny skit that soon leads into \\"The New Workout Plan\\" wich is a violin workout song that has a nice beat and rhymes that flow like water from the Nile River. \\"Slow Jamz\\" is an awesomley well crafted song that has a shockingly well sung chourus by actor Jamie Foxx(Who knew the guy could sind AND act?)and has a smoothly rapped verse by Kanye before Twista steals the show with rapping faster than a damn bullet train at 239 mph. \\"Breathe In Breathe Out\\" is a mediocre track featuring Ludacris and has a pretty good beat to it but the rhyming just is sub-par. \\"School Spirit Skit 1\\" is a fairly ridiculous skit but is kinda funny with the lines \\"And don't forget about that drug habit u picked up at school bein around your peers<br />Hey now you'll get that 25 thou, job a year and You'll spend all your money on crack cocaine, but it'll be you're your money No more borrowin money from mom for my high!\\" and leads into \\"School Spirit\\" is an awesome song with a really damn cool helium sung chourus and has some pretty good rhyming besides the kind of annoying \\" Alpha, step. Omega, step Kappa, step. Sigma, step\\" line that is repeated over and over and over again and gets annoying after a short while(Just imagine only hearing Alpha, step. Omega, step Kappa, step. Sigma, step for 3 minutes). \\"Lil' Jimmy Skit\\" is a HILARIOUS skit about being the smartest dead guy. \\"Two Words\\" is another song about how hard life is on the streets of America's biggest cities and says the very true words \\"Kanye West Hot Sh#t\\" over and over as it Kanye is reminding you of how smooth he really raps. \\"Through The Wire\\" is a excellent memoir of the car crash that almost ended Kanye West's life and describes in great deal how hard it was to get by after the crash that nearly claimed his life. The track also features a sample from the song \\"Through The Fire\\". \\"Family Buisiness\\" is a very clever song about how Kanye loves his family and how appreciative he is that he has a family. And finnally is the WAAAAAY to long song \\"Last Call\\" which is good at first but then goes on for 8 minutes of immature stupid adlibbed giggling, but has some good rhyming on it anyway. As a conclusion to this review i must say one last thing about this, Kanye West has made a new \\"Chronic\\" or \\"Raising Hell\\" and i suggest you buy this piece of Hip Hop history in the making as soon as you can because like Kanye so aptly says...\\"Im Kanye West...Hot Sh#t.\\"as made a new \\"Chronic\\" or \\"Raising Hell\\" and i suggest you buy this piece of Hip Hop history in the making as soon as you can because like Kanye so aptly says...\\"Im Kanye West...Hot Sh#t.\\"
B00005JLXE|1.0|If I could less than 1 I would. I think this movie is the combination of Batman and Spiderman, sometimes Daredevil's point of view in the movie is annoying, with many images and colors moving, that's a headache. And Ben Affleck shows again he's not an actor. Why everybody seems they can fly when they jump? Jennifer Garner is not great either, that's a sin.
B00000099Y|5.0|The idea that Tool's music is 'heavy' has been established. Althought there have been many arguments in regard to the artistic merit of Tool, they do achieve an elevated level of excellence within their genre, which is arguably metal. Aenima does seem at times slightly repetitive, but the crux of the merit of this album lies within its extremely poignant and very 'honest' approach. At times the lengthy introductions may seem a little too 'over the top;' however, these introductions only help establish the auras and motifs of the songs.  <br /> <br />There are two ways of analyzing an original artistic work (arguably more); one is to view it from an artistic standpoint, that is, to evaluate it in accordance to its complexity and originality. Although not as technically difficult or intricate as a Beethoven piece, the tracks on Aenima are certainly at a higher musicianship level than one would normanlly hear on a modern rock radio station. The syncopated rhythms and fairly original vocal melodies more than compensate for the seemingly repetitive form of the tracks.  <br /> <br />The other method of evaluating merit is that of its emotional and intellectual stimulus; this mostly pertains to lyrics and the auras and tensions created by the intrumentalists. This recording, and the band itself, is categorized as 'heavy,' but in most instances their lyrics are not necessarily 'cynical' but rather are meant to describe certain aspects of society whether they be negative or positive; this is exemplified in the album's title track. <br /> <br />This well produced and performed recording is a great buy and it does provide a tangible  method of creating an 'objective coreelative' that may pertain to one's own life; if not this, then this record is also entertaining and the intricacies of it are also nice to enjoy, especially by a well trained and seasoned ear.
B0002J4X1Q|3.0|This movie isn't as bad as they say, has intrigue and mystery, an of course the gorgeous Milla Jovovich. The bad part in the movie it's when Milla begins to have flashbacks and the heavy metal music. Or the bad special effects of the lickers. This isn't one of those bad zombie movies made with 4 dollars in the pocket, you never know what will happen around corner. And the movie ends with a surprise nobody expects, shocking.
B00005JN0T|3.0|Yup, that's it..great couple of effects...used entirely too much.  A good watch the first time....but not something to watch over and over.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|This is such an amazing work of art.  Like all of the best albums, you don't always know it upon first listen...but it just keeps getting better and better every time it is played.<br /><br />I've been supporting Nightwish for many years, and this is simply their strongest effort to date.  Many songs use a 20-something piece orchestra and you can hear it in throughout the production.<br /><br />I read that this was the same orchestra that Pip Williams used to record the Lord of the Rings soundtrack!!!<br /><br />Every song has something special about it.  At first listen, I noticed that the music is less keyboard driven this time around and focuses more on the guitar riffs.  At first the guitars seemed a bit much, but after a few listens, the mix feels just right.  Perhaps more guitar will help Nightwish grow in popularity in the US.  It was great to see them on tour in fall 2004!<br /><br />I cannot express how much I LOVE this album.  It provides some of the heaviest and also some of the most ambient moments on a Nightwish CD.  There is so much emotion.  Be sure to get the US release with 2 bonus tracks and music video!  Enjoy!!!
B00008EY65|3.0|Ever watch a video at home and say \\"geeze I'm glad I didn't buy that one!?\\"  Well this is one of them.  I thought for a moment I was watching \\"Raider of the lost Ark\\"..then it all went south...I mean what the heck?  I like logical progression...this isnt that..a Baby Ruth lovin' little red devil...(how'd that get there?) next thing..a full grown trouble makin', head grindin' cigar smokin' monster fighter..with a bad attitude.  Well one good thing..I still have my money....
B000294SFW|4.0|The best Punk album of 2004 was put out by a Heavy Metal Band.  This album sounds like the Motorhead of old.  All the kids out there who listen to the poser-pop punk of today, should listen to this album to get a real taste of what Punk is all about.
B00005JNJ7|5.0|Here it is, people.  Quite possibly the most crass and hilarious movie ever put onto celluloide!  Team America succeeds in every area possible.  It is low brow, extremely crude, and in-your-face. The use of puppets is nothing short of genius.  They are done very well, yet Matt and Trey take time to mock the limitations and nuances of puppetry.  This whole movie uses chiches and stereotypes to the fullest and to hilarious effect.  NOBODY is spared.  Actors get bashed.  Politics gets bashed.  The right gets bashed.  The left gets bashed.  Not a single soul is spared.  As some have said, this is NOT a kids movie, so use discretion if you feel necessary. This is a great movie if you  just wanna take a break from the world and its problems, sit back, and laugh at.... everything!<br /><br />On a side note, its too bad people let their politics get in the way. A lot of people have expressed outrage that Stone and Parker would DARE make fun of Michael Moore and liberal Hollywood. Bash the right, fine, bash the left... watch out!! I find this amusing and irritating at the same time.  I think its all fair game, and for those uptight people out there, NO, this movie is not a conservative Bush-loving re-election vehicle. That is ridiculous. (There are really people who think this!!)  I have two simple words to those who are all up in arms over this movie: LOOSEN UP!!
B00005ASHM|3.0|Anybody that thinks this is the greatest album of all time is an unmitigated kook.  Talk about personal taste.  I didn't even recognize any of the songs except three.  Regardless of whatever technological genius it has, it is definitely dated and relatively forgettable.  The cover and title don't help.  It looks like the kind of album my parents had in their collection back in the mid sixties.  And all of those albums are long gone, i.e., the soundtrack to \\"Stop the World I Want to Get Off\\" and \\"Sonny & Cher\\".    Though the album starts off well with \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and improves tremendously with \\"You Still Believe In Me\\", it falls into mediocrity until the halfway decent \\"Sloop John B\\", falters again with \\"God Only Knows\\", improves tremendously again with \\"I Know There's An Answer\\", and then falls once again into complete mediocrity for the remainder of the album.      There is no relevant comparison to Rubber Soul, Sgt. Pepper, (or any Beatles album for that matter).  Those albums are infinitely more complex and enjoyable.  Every song is utterly unforgettable on at least 8 Beatles album, 7 Zeppelin albums, 10 Stones albums, 8 Elton John albums, 2 Doors albums, 5 Neil Young albums and many many others. And what about Who's Next, Surrealistic Pillow, Cheap Thrills, Band of Gypsies, and countless other masterpieces.      Part of being \\"the greatest of all time\\" definitely includes being able to endure and remain relevant. Many of the sounds and especially lyrics on this album sound silly and high-schoolish by todays standards.  There's a reason this ablum rarely gets bought anymore.  It's just not worth the 2 or 3 songs that are still appealing, though I will say the two songs \\"You Still Believe In Me\\" and \\"I Know There's An Answer absolutely make this album worth owning, along with \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\" and \\"Sloop John B\\".  But if you can get them all on a greatest hits album it's a better buy.      It's a decent album, maybe even really good, and it certainlyhas moments of brilliance, but about 1,000 other albums blow it out of the water like the A Bomb over Bikini Atoll.     Over and out  (the Professor recommends: \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" by Jefferson Airplane)     P.S.:  I just went out and bought this album and take back everything I just wrote except that this is still not the greatest album of all time.
B0002X314C|3.0|This cd is first off not a classic.  With the climate of black music leaning towards hip-hop more then soul this cd does give you a fix you have been looking for.  Pick it up mainly because who knows when you are going to get some decent r&b.  By r&b I mean true vocals and instruments and talent.  So buy it just for that.
B000286S8S|5.0|This is the album to get if you want all of Van Halen's best from both the David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar eras. You get all of the classics like \\"Beautiful Girls\\", \\"Panama\\", \\"Ain't Talkin About Love\\", \\"The Best Of Both Worlds\\", \\"Right Now\\", and many more. Also included are a few live tracks, which is a big plus. This is a great collection and anyone who likes good music should enjoy this compilation.
0395925037|3.0|This is a review of the Mannheim translation. <br /> <br />After reading Hayek's The Road to Serfdom and von Mises' Omnipotent Government, I wanted to see what the relationship of Nazism to socialism was in Hitler's own words.  I also wanted to know whether the German people were simply predisposed to Nazism, as Shirer insinuates in The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, or whether Hitler had presented an agenda that appealed to them economically, as Brustein finds in The Logic of Evil.  I found surprises in both respects. <br /> <br />Hitler was no great writer, and admitted his preference for oral communication.  He was a master of propaganda, and explains his method throughout MK, including especially his belief that the National Socialist German Workers (Nazi) Party should recruit primarily from the working class, rejecting intellectualism and adopting a defiant, menacing, and if necessary, violent stance.  His philosophy, though bizarre, is self-consistent on the surface.  The anti-semitism is a recurring theme, but he neither explains nor defends it.  For me, there were three main thematic surprises: Hitler's embrace of socialism and simultaneous rejection of Marxism, his equivocation between Jews, Marxists, and capitalists, and his foreshadowing of events to come. <br /> <br />After his parents left him orphaned just as he reached his early adulthood, he moved to Vienna to pursue his intended career as an artist.  Unfortunately (both for Hitler and for history), he was rejected and became a poor day laborer.  The passages in which he describes the demoralizing effects of poverty read like Upton Sinclair's The Jungle.  Somehow, he managed to reject Marxism in those days, possibly because the tabloids he seems to have preferred wrote it off as a Jewish conspiracy.  However, he does seem to have genuinely embraced a brand of socialism which would uplift and allow working classes to embrace German culture and to produce little German warriors for the \\"coming struggle\\".  Indeed, throughout MK, wherever he refers to socialism, it is positive, and he is careful to distinguish it from Marxism, which he consistently rejects on the grounds of its Jewish origins. <br /> <br />In addition to conflating Jews and Marxists, Hitler also rejected capitalism as a Jewish ideology.  He euphemistically uses communist, democrat, internationalist, and other epithets to refer to Jews-as-Marxists, and \\"international finance\\", Manchesterism, hyperindividualist, and other such epithets to refer to Jews-as-capitalists.  In his theory, the Jews are a supranational state, a nation who attached themselves parasitically to \\"real\\" nations like the Germans.  They had been taking from the German state in their role as financiers, and were especially successful in using the treaties concluding WWI to do so.  However, he claims that they were also using Marxist theory to seal the trap, playing both ends against the middle.  How this worked, he never explained, but he does steer Nazism through the middle as a philosophy that protects German workers (as opposed to all workers, or German landowners, intellectuals, and capitalists) against foreign parasites (which meant, of course, Jews). <br /> <br />Finally, he strongly suggests the events yet to come.  That was surprising given the context in which MK was written: at the time, Hitler was in jail for leading a silly coup in a corner of Germany, his party had been outlawed, and Germany was thoroughly out of the picture as a military power.  Just as von Mises claims, Hitler's economic program calls for wage and price controls.  Those controls would be pressured by international trade (conducted against the Germans by Jews, of course), so Hitler realizes that Germany would have to be self-sufficient.  WWI came about in part because it had been thought that Germany could achieve self-sufficiency by obtaining colonies to produce food paid for by manufactured goods sold in them.  Hitler rejects this approach and outlines a plan for taking land in the East.  Although Hitler always describes such struggles as if they would have to take place over the course of generations, we need no longer guess at what was to become of the inhabitant Slavs. <br /> <br />Ultimately, Hitler was freed, reinvigorated his gang/party, obtained a third of the votes in the country, gained the Chancellorship and implemented the dictatorship implicit in his Fuhrerprinzip theory of responsibility and leadership.  From the perspective of the Austrian economists, this was the culmination of decades of socialist theory in German politics.  Hayek dedicated TRTS to \\"socialists of all parties\\" because he saw similar trends in England in 1944.  Today, if we replaced the word \\"Jew\\" in this tract with \\"multinationals\\", \\"outsourcers\\", or \\"jihadists\\", and if we dropped the references to race out of the 25-point Nazi economic-political program, would their programs be palatable to a majority of voters in a western nation?  Finding answers to current problems is the reason we read historical texts, especially when the ideas in them led to great evil.
B00001ZULV|4.0|The Genesis greatest hits collection \\"Turn It On Again: The Hits\\" delivers pretty much all of the bands biggest pop hits. I was a bit disappointed that some of the longer songs such as \\"Abacab\\" and \\"Tonight,Tonight,Tonight\\" have been edited down to shorter versions, which takes away part of the listening experience. Also, understandably this is a Phil Collins era dominated compilation, but it is missing some songs worthy of making the final cut. \\"Dance On A Volcano\\" and \\"Home By The Sea\\" are a few that come to mind. Also, I was happy to see that some Peter Gabriel material was present, showcasing the work to listeners who may not have never been exposed to it. Overall, this collection could be improved, but people who only want the best known pop hits from Genesis should be satisfied.
B0002TT0NW|4.0|Some people seem to be getting confused between the books and the films ... there is no way that anyone could make a Harry Potter film and include every detail from the books, the films would be hours long.. they have to try and capture the essence of the books and, on the whole, I think Cuaron did well. I loved the three kids (Dan, Rupert and Emma) .. they have grown up and matured as actors and I just hope and pray that they will continue to use them for all seven films ... if they change them then it will cause a lot more continuity problems than Hagrids hut. I can understand people complaining about the siting of Hagrids Hut and Hogwarts .. it's a bit like 'Return of the King' being shot in Australia all of a sudden ... if you are watching the movies back to back then it doesn't quite gel .. but it's only a small problem. I loved the Dementors and the Knight Bus even though they weren't quite as described and as well as the kids thought Alan Rickman, Robbie Coltrane, Maggie Smith and Tom Felton were excellent. The biggest problem I had with it was the infamous Quidditch final ... or lack of it - I really wanted to see Oliver Wood triumph .. also the scene where Professor Snape calls Hermione an insufferable know-it-all ... Ron doesn't say 'he's got a point you know' he actually gets a detention for sticking up for Hermione .. I just can't understand why that change was made ... Emma Thompson did a good job as Professor Trelawney but wasn't quite 'insect' enough for me and I missed Richard Harris's twinkle .. he was great.David Thewlis grew on me as Professor Lupin and Gary Oldman will probably go on to make an excellent Sirius Black .. though he was a little bit over the top .. it was bordering on comedy when he was yelling in the Shrieking Shack.  Overall though it's a great film and .. along with the others .. will go down as a classic in years to come and, as I've already said, if Jo Rowling gave it her thumbs up (and she works closely with the screen writerI believe) then none of us have the right to complain.
0767834739|4.0|I was kept very entertained throughout the entire movie, I hope there is a sequel (from the ending it looks as though they have planned for one).  I thought the first RE was scarier and perhaps a little more gory than this one, but this is way more packed with action and racing against time type plot with some suspense.  All in all I'm going to buy the DVD, so I liked it enough to watch again and again! And I don't even play the video game...but then again I love sci-fi movies.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|A black sail aproaches the beach of Troy, bearing the terrible and fearsome Myrmidons -Achillles's warriors; meanwhile, at the gates of Troy, Hector harangues his soldiers: they must fight, he urges them, to defend their mother, Troy. Inmediately afer this scene, we can hear Achilles, also haranguing his Myrmidons: he promises them the glory of inmortality if they die while fighting against three times their number on that beach. This contrast Achilles/Hector is the centre around which the film revolves since the moment when Achilles's mother (Goddess Thetis) gives him the choice of either living a life of love and dignity (after which his name will sink into oblivion), or one of fighting and death (after which his name will be immortal). Achilles chooses this last possibility right away, and we are shown, as we get to know the character, that Hector represents the first one. They are, thus, incompatible, and there can't be one of them where there is the other. So, from the beginning, we learn to love the character of Hector, who is beloved of all who know him, and full of dignity (and WONDERFULLY played by Eric Bana). The final combat between these two characters (a truly great scene) is a moment of great tension and pathos, even though we know the final result of this confrontation. <br /> <br />Is this the only ethic choice we are shown in the movie? No. At the beginning of the film Menelaus gives a toast: \\"may the gods keep the wolves in the hills and our women in our beds!\\" And this is just what most characters in the story do...leave their responsibilities in the hands of the gods (as Priam repeatedly does when he refuses to see the danger that the Greeks -the \\"wolves\\"- represent, thinking that apollo will deliver them form this tribulation, as he has used to do in many other past wars). But, as Odyseus tells Achilles, \\"we must play with the toys the gods give us\\", and if we refuse to do this (control our own life, make our decissions) others will do it for us, and boy will it be worse!  <br /> <br />We must make our own decissions and face the consequences of these, something Paris and Helen always fail to do, leaving others to suffer the results of their thoughtless and impulsive actions. In fact this was the worst fear I had about a popular movie rendering of The Illiad: that it might glorify and beautify the Helen/Paris affair, something that, I think, the original version does not. But, thanks the gods, this film does not yield to this easy temptation. <br /> <br />So, is this just another dumb vulgar Hollywood version of the Illiad? Granted, there are many details where it betrays Homer's story: the war lasted longer than just some days, Agamemnon did not die this way, many characters are missing or just sketchy, etc. But one must be dumb to think these details are anything more important than just so many turnings of a very long plot. What is really important is that Homer composed his epic poem to entertain while giving his audience food for thought with the universal moral themes that the characters' actions exemplify. And this Hollywood version proves that these moral themes are truly universal,and the actions of the characters that bring them to us are as likely to engage the attention of a modern day audience as they were 3,000 years ago. Now, is this dumb??! NO, it isn't!!!!     <br /> <br />
B000003BF1|5.0|They were the best rock & roll band ever. And this is my favorite of all of their greats. Lay back and listen to truly great album. Gimme Shelter has the most haunting guitar intro ever.
B000003S5H|5.0|I put this album in my cd player a few days ago, after having gone months without a single listen. I had bought this cd almost 2 years ago, and enjoyed it, but over time it faded away. I put it in for kicks and was blown away. EVERY SINGLE TRACK is amazing, I wouldnt skip around if you payed me. It's a journey, an experience in your head that can only be described as my favourite fantasy. So dim the lights, put on moon safari, and say goodbye.
0226264211|5.0|Milton Friedman has been one of the most effective advocates of free enterprise in the U.S. for many years.  Although often called a \\"conservative,\\" he is perhaps best described as a moderate libertarian; that is, he supports more intervention into the economy than the typical libertarian.  In addition, his school of theoretical economics (monetarism) differs sharply from the Austrianism embraced by many in the libertarian movement.  He has also advocated schemes that tacitly accept a substantial role for government in society, such as the voucher system, the \\"negative\\" income tax, and the flat tax.    CAPITALISM AND FREEDOM discusses many of the basic issues of the role of government in the economy, such as monetary policy, monopolies, licensing and the like.  The work came out in 1962 and I particularly enjoyed the discussion of education.  Friedman noted even then that teachers' salaries had been rising, but inflexible (i.e, union negotiated) contracts prevented schools from rewarding good teachers.  This system, which is almost inevitable with government schooling, virtually insures that schools will stay mediocre.  It shouldn't be surprising, then, that the marginal changes in the past few years (magnet schools and some incentives for good teachers) have done little to increase the quality of education.  (For more on this, see Brimelow's book on teachers unions, THE WORM IN THE APPLE.)    Other introductory works on the role of government in a free society from a similar perspective are LIBERALISM by L. von Mises and FOR A NEW LIBERTY by M. Rothbard.
B00029LNHS|5.0|I luv this cd. it's my favorite cd of all time. it's worth however much it costs. i got it for christmas, but if i knew how good it was, i would of paid anything for it. some of the songs have misleading intros, and you don't want to listen to it, but if you wait awhile most of them get a lot better. My favorite ones are Let's Get It Retarded/started, Shut Up,and The Boogie That Be.

Through the years the younger daughter has undergone many hospitalizations and invasive procedures to get body parts for her sister.  At 13, the younger girl learns that a kidney transplant is planned in order to save her sisters life. She decides to sue her parents for the rights to her own body. She hires a lawyer and proceeds with her case, despite the fact that she deeply loves her sister as well as her parents - and that her sister is becoming more and more ill by the day. <br /> <br />This is a story of our times, when medical procedures can create situations where there are no easy solutions. Here Picoult forces readers to think about the question: If you use one of your children to save the life of another, are you being a good mother ... or a very bad one. <br />

B0006IIKS0|4.0|I would like to begin by stating that I am not a Metallica fan, I am a documentary fan, and it is from that perspective that I am writing this review.  This is a very well made documentary and it does a good job of showing the complications that were encountered by Metallica during the creation of their newest album.  I think the main problems I have with this film stem from the biases I have toward the band, not the movie itself.  Whether it be Jason Newsted's invention of a new word (\\"squillions\\") or the scene where Lars uses the word \\"stock\\" approximately 20 times to describe a heavily used guitar riff, Metallica irritates me.  The movie also does an excellent job of presenting the band in a good light, as opposed to a group of angry neanderthals.  I think that the MTV news footage is the most effective way of detracting from the hardcore image of Metallica seeing as how when I think MTV, I don't think hardcore. <br />Some kind of monster is entertaining, but I would imagine that Metallica fans would get a lot more \\"bang for their buck\\" out of this movie.  This is a must-have for any Metallica fan, as well as a must-see (note the absense of the word have) for any individual who enjoys documentaries.  The massive amount of special features on the two disc set is enough to make any fan of the band salivate, but I can't comment on the quality of the features seeing as how I have little interest in seeing them for myself.  Overall, this is a great film, and is worth the nearly two and a half hours that have to be invested in it.  If you're a Metallica fan, do yourself a favor and buy this, but this is one that everyone can appreciate.
B0006213WG|4.0|This is probably their best album mainly because I didn't like their early albums but this album is somewhat better. Better arrangements especially with the Metallica like sounding in some of the songs and maybe some Maiden bits. <br /> <br />A good fun album album, nothing too serious.

Its #$%^@ crap thats what it is! <br /> <br />How can you call this  <br />\\"mainstream, manufactured sounding, easily accessible to people ranging from \\"little kid to adult\\" music, and call it Punk Rock!\\" <br /> <br />Talk about being a shadow of your former self!!! <br /> <br />This is without a doubt the worst Green Day album ever, and they have destroyed themselves, they are nothing like they used to be. <br /> <br />Compare \\"Dookie\\" \\"Insomniac\\" \\"Nimrod\\" \\"Warning\\" with this and its quite easy to see that their previous albums were absoultely brilliant and each one very unique. And they all sounded \\"real\\" and unpolished. Which is what Punk Rock is. <br /> <br />As for \\"American Idiot\\" its a fake sounding album, and anyone from a little kid to a grown adult would buy this rubbish!!! <br /> <br />Unbeileivable - they've disgraced themselves!
B00002Z88D|5.0|I had never heard Metallica before. Sure, I had heard of them, but never their music. Then, one day on the ride home from school, I heard the song \\"No leaf clover\\" on the radio. I'm not exagurating when I say that I felt chills and tingles on my skin from the power of that song. Ever since then, I have been addicted to Metallica. I love almost all of their other albums, But this one is most definatly the best. I dont care if some people say that Metallica became 'sellouts' because they played with a symphony. All I know is that when yur are so enthralled with a song that you actualy stop breathing, the music has to be good. And it is definately that good. I have listened to it nearly every day for about a year, and i'm still not tired of this cd. Oh yeah, and just thought I'd mention one last think. I hated all metal util I heard this cd! That's one serious transformation if you ask me. anyway, buy this cd! buy it before food!
B00011CZRE|5.0|A chilling exploration of the individual hells we create for ourselves and each other. The director's hand is masterful as he slowly reveals the precise logic behind a serial killer's choice of victims. This is so subtly done that you are seduced into subconscious agreement with these choices; the victims are guilty \\"as charged\\" - or perceived. Until the two penultimate victims are chosen... <br /> <br />Script, casting, production values and music are all perfect for this gut-punch of a movie. Freeman in particular is wrenching in his portrayal of an honest, intelligent Everyman failing to contain the agony and dread and horror of living in an urban inferno - but ultimately shouldering the burden yet again and soldiering on, failure or no. <br /> <br />A flawless expos of what lies at the heart of our modern disease; the eighth, deadliest sin: lack of compassion.
B000000W3G|5.0|i got this box set for christmas and i LOVE it. im a huge smashing pumpkins fan. i wasnt too sure about some of the songs at first. but now that ive listened to all of them i think its definately some of the best smashing pumpkins music. my favorites are god, mouths of babes, and transformer. but i also love the cover songs destination unknown, my blue heaven, you're all ive got tonight, and clones (we're all). i would definately recommend this for any pumpkin fan.

B00009ATIX|5.0|this is more than a science fiction film, this is more than a love story. there is something about this that is so satisfying, soothing even. just the score alone is enough to watch this movie- infact i strongly suggest purchasing the score soundtrack (fall asleep to it on repeat... your dreams will be vivid and calm) but back to the film. wonderful in every way, and of course natascha is as beautiful as ever- i think i feel in love with her more than the movie. see it-buy it-dream it
B00064MW6A|4.0|I didn't see this movie at the theater because of all the bad reviews.  Finally I talked myself into renting the movie and to my suprise I enjoyed it, not as a great movie for all to see but as a superhero flick with lots of fun and attitude. <br /> <br />Any one that would take a movie spawned from comics too seriously has already set them self up to dis-like somthing that is meant to entertain rather than be so realistic its boring.  While I would agree that Spiderman 2 was better made and possibly more beleivable there were spots I felt like saying \\"OK! OK! lets get to the action, we know spidy's in-love with Mary Jane.\\" <br /> <br />That said...Catwomen got right to business (so to speak) and never stopped. There were cheesey spots But name one superhero movie that didn't.  Even the best of them did!  Its just a movie that is not as bad as most would have you beleive.  And all of you complaining about the leather...If you were a true fan you would know that catwoman must have the leather so quite haten on Halle Berry.  For her not to wear the tight leather would be like Superman with-out the cape and Batman with-out his Utility belt....anway.... <br /> <br />Its A fun movie that I could recommend seeing atleast once!
B00004Y6O7|5.0|When I began to listen to Van Halen, I was more into Sammy Hagar as a singer than David Lee Roth. But when I began to listen to more of the older albums such as Van Halen, 1984, and Fair Warning, that's when I began to really get into the Roth material. Especially from VH's darkest and somewhat weakest album stat-wise of the Roth era but in my mind its what Van Halen needed all along. Every track sounds so angry, heavy, awesome, and somewhat serious that it shows that Van Halen can break away from a party- harty attitude. In my opinion this album is great out of the Roth series. With David Lee Roth's vocals are great as usual, Michael Anthony's Bass parts really stand out and are great on every song, Alex Van Halen's drums are extremely catchy and fantastic like always, and Eddie Van Halen just keeps mowing down everything in his path with his guitar parts and solos like always and its absolutely terrific. Perfect album period. <br /> <br />1. Mean Streets- (10/10) <br />2. Dirty Movies- (10/10) <br />3. Sinner's Swing- (8/10) <br />4. Hear About it Later- (11/10) <br />5. Unchained- (11/10) <br />6. Push Comes to Shove- (8/10) <br />7. So this is Love- (10/10) <br />8. Sunday Afternoon in the Park- (9/10) <br />9. One Foot Out the Door- (9.5/10)
B0006399FS|1.0|First off, these musicians need to realize they are old.  Not that age means you cannot make great music but to think you can get in touch with all generations because you wear a cowboy hat and glasses is stupid. Bono constantly wearing those glasses should be reason enough to hate this album. Boring album with so-so guitar playing and meaningless lyrics.  PLease U2 fanboys don't talk about the depth of them and the fact that there are so many layers to these songs because they aren't. My favorite line is the title of the song \\" Love and Peace, or Else.\\"  This is a refreshing thought coming from pacifists. Or else. Without using violence, the only way they could possibly do any harm is by releasing another album. For a much better review check out maddox's page titled \\"the eleven worst songs of 2004\\"
B0000025RI|5.0|Anybody who doesn't like at least one song on this album. Doesn't know great music. You have to put the personal life of MJ aside and judge this album on the merit of its quality.  <br /> <br />\\"Billie Jean\\" is amazing \\"Beat It\\" is superb, \\"Human Nature\\" is a thing of beauty. The only song I don't care for on this album is \\"The Girl Is Mine\\". But over two thirds of this album is alltime classic. And I rarely like more than 2 or 3 songs on an album. <br /> <br />If anybody wonders why this album continues to sell over a million copes a year. Take a good listen. And ask yourself, \\"Is there a single album out there today half as good\\"?? I don't think so, get it!!!
B00008H2LB|1.0|I bought this CD in search of hope after Hilary Duff failed.  I thought it would be nice, soft music to bring me hope after I ran away from my hometown.  But ah, did I think wrong! This is extremely loud music.  Do not buy this in search of hope.   <br /> <br />Sincerely, <br />Thank You <br /> <br />P.S. I am putting my sister for sale.  Two Cents.  Good day.  Godspeed.
0385510454|3.0|I enjoyed reading this story and especially the descriptions of Italy and Italian people, food, clothes, etc.  The characters are likable (unlike the King of Torts' main character who I could never force myself to like) and the story is compelling enough to make this a page turner.<br /><br />My only negative comment centers around the fact that Grisham still really seems to struggle on wrapping up the story.  It's another abrupt ending that left me wanting more closure.  I'm amazed that he can be so talented and popular but still struggle in this area.  In the final analysis, however, I think it's still worth the read.
B0006UFZNQ|5.0|As a young child in the nineteen fifties, I used to watch this film whenever it appeared on TV on \\"Million Dollar Movie\\". I loved it then. I love it now. Time has not diminished the capacity of this film to mesmerize and hold the viewer in its thrall.<br /><br />The story line is basic. Carl Denham (Robert Armstrong), a filmmaker and entrepreneur, leads an expedition to Skull Island where he discovers its deep, dark secret. It is a land where time has stood still, and prehistoric monsters still hold sway over the island and its inhabitants. There, the natives pay homage to the one whom they revere as \\"Kong\\", and who is, indeed, king of the island.<br /><br />Denham, together with his beautiful, budding starlet, Ann Darrow (Fay Wray), as well as with the crew of the ship that brought him to Skull Island, investigates the strange ritual being performed on the island by its native population. Before she knows it, Ann finds herself captured by the natives. She is to become the bride of the mysterious \\"Kong\\".<br /><br />When Ann discovers who the mysterious \\"Kong\\" is, she starts screaming and doesn't stop. The ship's first mate, Jack Driscoll (Bruce Cabot), who happens to be in love with Ann, manages to rescue her from the clutches of \\"Kong\\". Notwithstanding the fact that \\"Kong\\" has taken a shine to her, Ann is relieved to have been rescued by the man whom she loves.<br /><br />Denham then arranges to capture the creature, whom he calls \\"King<br /><br />Kong\\", and takes him back to New York on the ship that brought them to Skull Island. There, King Kong makes his debut, one that movie lovers will long remember.<br /><br />The special effects of this film were superlative for its time and still pass muster today. The relationship between the beauty and the beast still makes the viewer sit up and take notice. This is an attention grabbing film that is as exciting today, as when it was first released over seventy years ago. It is unfortunate, however, that the film does not appear to have been restored and re-mastered to its original condition. Still, the film itself is truly a timeless classic. Bravo!appear to have been restored and re-mastered to its original condition. Still, the film itself is truly a timeless classic. Bravo!
B00005PJ8O|2.0|I saw this film in the 1970's and this DVD edition, although it does not state that it is cut, has cut out the scene where Patton meets someone while he is on the toilet.  The language also has probably been edited (euphamisms for the F word) which I am fairly sure were in the original. <br /> <br />I am extremely diappointed in the manufacturer for doing something like this to the film without informing it's audience and buyers...seems like faud to me. <br /> <br />The original movie was great, a cut version is by definition less so.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie lacked a deep plot and I found it extremely boring.
B000035Z1Z|5.0|There are too many great things about this film to reduce to a short list, but a few of my favorites are Kevin Kline and his fantastic French accent, Franois Cluzet in his adorable role as the smarmy French charmer and thief, Jean Reno who's fab, as usual, Meg Ryan and her smart-ass come backs, and of course, la musique which makes you feel as if you can actually smell the caf and croissants.  C'est magnifique. <br /> <br />I saw this film at college in the midst of my French BA and, largely b/c of this wonderful story, flew off the following summer to France where I fell in love myself!  Ah, l'amour!  Ah, la belle France! <br />
B000750OEA|5.0|I stumbled on this DVD by accident in a music store, and being a massive Kylie fan I scooped it up. This video collections hold Kylie's more popular videos as quite a few videos were left off. Those left out are: Word is out, Made in heaven, What kind of fool?, Finer feelings, If you were with me now and the ones that I have wanted to see the most-Where is the feeling?, Some kind of bliss, Cowboy style,GBI, and the elusive Your disco needs you video. But this collection holds all the videos from Light Years(Spinning Around, On a night a like this, Kids, and Please stay), Fever(Can't get you out of my head, In your eyes, Love at first sight, and Come into my world) and Body Language(Slow, Red blooded woman, and Chocolate).Plus this DVd has her newest video I believe in you. The rest of the music videos on this collection are: I should be so lucky, Got to be certain, The loco-motion, Je ne sais pas pourquoi, Especially for you, Hand on your heart, Wouldn't change a thing,Never too late, Tears on my pillow, Better the devil you know, Step back in time, What do I have to do?, Shocked, Give me just a little more time, Confide in me, Put yourself in my place,Where the wild roses grow, Did it again, and Breathe. Plus it has the performance of Can't get Blue Monday out of my head that Kylie performed at the BRIT awards. So even though there are some videos that I would have liked to see on the DVD, it's a great addition to have if you are a massive Kylie fan like me.
B000000IRB|1.0|This is, of course a classic in every sense of the word.  Every minute of the album is filled with some of the best music ever written and performed.  However, this particular version is WAY to quiet to enjoy.  Even with a powerful stereo on full blast, it can barely be heard.  I don't know what they were thinking when they issued this version.  It's like a huge mistake that wasn't caught in time.<BR>Buy and enjoy this excellent album, but stay far away from this version or you will be disappointed.
1592400876|4.0|I admit it, I love the British sense of humor and anything to do with wordplay. So, if I need to refresh my punctuation knowledge, I might as well get a laugh out of it. This was a surprisingly fun read and helpful in clearing up a few of those pesky punctuation questions that always nagged me.
B00005B36H|5.0|I became a small fan of Tool a few years back when Schism was being played on the radio.But it wasn't too long ago when I became a fan of A Perfect Circle.I liked Thirteenth Step so I bought Tool's Aenima.I suddenly became a huge fan of Tool.So a few weeks later I bought Lateralus.It was amazing.All songs are great in their own special way... <br /> <br />The Grudge-Great opener,you have to hear the vocals.Especially when Maynard James Keenen does his 23 second scream. <br /> <br />Eon Blue Acoplpyse-A short guitar performance.Great opener to The Patient. <br /> <br />The Patient-Slow at first but becomes a great song. <br /> <br />Mantra-Weird Filler/opener to Schism. <br /> <br />Schism-The song every has heard but still one greatest songs. <br /> <br />Parabol/Parabola-Awesome song and has great video to back it up. <br /> <br />Ticks And Leeches-Wow!Amazing Drum Performance by Danny Carrey. <br /> <br />Lateralus-Great guitar solos by Adam Jones. <br /> <br />Disposition/Reflection/Traid-Very long and epic and has Tools first REAL instrumental on Traid. <br /> <br />Faip Op Paid-Strange undescrible ending. <br /> <br />Overall Lateralus is a Must-buy.
B000055XMF|5.0|Franc Roddam's adaptation of the the Who's concept album(not \\"rock opera\\") \\"Quadrophenia\\" is a great depiction of young adulthood during a specific time and place.  This film not only gets all of the physical details right but it also touches on all of the emotional ones, too.  The themes here are universal.  Who among us has not, to some degree, wasted our lives by trying to forge an identity by associating with a clique and make all the wrong decisions not by personal choice but through imagined peer pressure?  Our everyman here is Jimmy Cooper, masterfully played by Phil Daniels.  Jimmy, when not working at his dead-end mailroom job at an ad firm, lives for the opportunity to club and get an amphetamine high with his mod friends.  The climax of this life choice is a weekend at Brighton Beach on the English coast where Jimmy and his friends can intimidate vacationers and rumble with their chosen rivals, the leather-clad rockers.  What Jimmy doesn't anticipate is that after all is said and done you have to wake up the next morning and return to reality.  I was fortunate to have seen this film as a teenager in the theatres but it didn't do much box office outside of the arthouses.  The Cockney accents here are a little thick so you have to strain your ears somewhat.  But there is no mistaking the powerful lyrics by Pete Townshend that act as a greek chorus to what is happening on screen.  The film and it's soundtrack some thirty years on have lost none of their staying power.
0385510454|5.0|The story is very well written and suspenseful. It kept me going when I should of been studying for my test. It has everything you look for in a novel; informative, intrigue, very interesting characters, conflict, rising tension, and a great climax. Just a great book. <br />
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I heard of Muse through a friend a couple of months ago.From that moment on, Ive become more or less obsessed with this staggeringly talented,simply incredible band. Listening to their music, I'm amazed how a group of such young guys are capable of creating music that is so mature and inspired. Not only that, but they are truly amazing musicians, and they are even better live than on tape. It really makes me mad to hear all this negativity about Muse coming from die-ahrd Radiohead fans. I like Radiohead a lot, and I do acknowledge that the two bands do share certain similarities in terms of melodical and vocal style. However, it never once struck me that Muse were \\"blatanly imitating\\" Radiohead, as so many enraged reviewers have stated here. Almost every band I know is influenced by one another, and I don't see anything wrong with that if the band/musician has his or her own style. And that is something that Muse have demonstrated time and time again that they possess.  <br /> <br />And if Muse and Radiohead are alike, its more in terms of the melodical structure of their songs, than in actual arrangements and instrumentation. And, yes, Matt Bellamy and Thom Yorke do sound A LOT alike. However, while Thom Yorke pretty much stays in the same range with his singing, Matt Bellamy sounds different on every song, and is capable of taking his voice from high and tender, into a piercing growl with an ease that only a true master can manage. Thom Yorke is more brooding, while Bellamy soars.  <br /> <br />Muse is a band which I respect for many things. One thing I can't help but admire them for is how they are able to have a varied sound on every song without jeopoardizing their own style. You can't say that Muse has a \\"Best album\\" because I think that all of their albums are on the same level. But it must be said that Absolution has some of their best material ever. The opener, Apocalypse Please is a gorgeous song with amazing piano. It is simply explosive and almost epic,and I get shivers down my spine every time I listen to it.It is one of my all time favorite Muse songs. Time is Running Out is the most pop sounding song on the cd. It starts out with a sexy, almost trip-hop like beat, before moving into a typical Muse style rock chorus. Sing For Absolution is another gorgeous song. The verses are tender and beautiful, and the chorus just soars. The song really climaxes beautifully towards the end. Blackout is another gorgeous song. Its a beautiful ballad with lovely string flourishes and a gorgeous melody. \\"Don't kid yourself, Don't fool yourself. This life's too good to last.\\" Love that song. Butterflies and Hurricanes is another mind-blowing, all-out rocker with an amazing melody, incredible instruments, and a stunning piano part towards the end. And those are just my favorite songs, but Muse are consistenly stunning on this album.Maybe some songs are better than other, but there are no duds. <br /> <br />I reccomend Muse to everyone. I really think that they are capable of appealing to a wide variety of audiences because they make music that transcends age or genre. It is truly beautiful and inspired music, and I don't think that any real musical lover will be able to defy that.
B00005QY5Y|4.0|There's some first-rate material here.  Ryan Adams is very talented, and when he connects he's a true pleasure to listen to.  But as a whole this disc is unfocused and uneven, jumping from one musical style to a radically different one in a jarring and annoying way.  Also, not all the tracks are good; there are some bloated duds mixed in with the gold.   <br /> <br />The good tracks are really good.  \\"New York\\" is a flat-out winner, as are \\"Firecracker,\\" \\"Answering Bell\\" and \\"La Cienega.\\"  Other really good tracks include \\"The Rescue Blues,\\"Somehow, Someday,\\"When the Stars Go Blue\\" and \\"Harder Now That It's Over.\\"  \\"Goodnight Hollywood Boulevard\\" is a lovely, plaintive closer.  \\"Nobody Girl\\" starts out well but drags on way too long, five minutes too long. <br /> <br />The other tracks are not so strong.  Adams plays in many styles, but that doesn't mean he's good at all of them.  When he plays hard rock he tries too hard, as if he's trying to sound like Nirvana or the Rolling Stones, which he's not.  \\"Sylvia Plath\\" is a thud dud.  Other tracks are lacking, too.  Adams or someone at Universal should have done a better editing job. <br /> <br />The good news is:  pick and choose, trim the excess and excesses, and you've got a terrific album.  You only have to listen to the tracks you like.  I copy all my CDs to my hard disc, which gives me control over which songs I play.  If you haven't started doing this you may as well get going, because all music will be on computers in a few years.  This also gives you the ability to edit overlong songs with a music editing program, like the excellent Adobe Audition, which I use.  I took five minutes off of \\"Nobody Girl\\" and gave it a 30-second fadeout, and now it's a terrific 4-minute song.  And I loaded the good tracks mentioned above.   <br /> <br />In the end, I wound up with 39 minutes of excellent music, a coherent, tight disc by an artist with a true original stamp and command over his best songs.  39 minutes of very goodmusic is quite an accomplishment. The Rolling Stones' \\"Beggars Banquet\\" was 40 minutes; The Beatles' \\"Rubber Soul\\" was 29 minutes.  <br /> <br />Five stars after the edits.
B00006RAKP|2.0|The first disc in this two-disc collection is great (except for \\"Candle in the Wind\\", which was never much of a song but got popular because it piggy-backed on Princess Di's death).  Your Song, Daniel, and other great tunes are on the first disc.  But look at the playlist on disc 2...  you might know one or two of them, but do you consider them 'greatest hits', or even 'okay songs'?  Do you want to spend money to have them in your CD collection?  Up to you, but I'm disappointed.
B000683VI4|5.0|this movie is amazing! it is so romantic without being corny or stupid. ive seen this movie 5 times and will buy it as soon as it comes out. even if you are not usually into romantic movies, like myself, you will still like this. truly amazing.
B00026W82U|5.0|I was introduced to Kings of Convenience when I was in Norway in 2002. I bought their first album \\"Quiet is the New Loud\\" but I couldn't really get into it - it was too laidback for me. I do like the remixed version of the album, which was named \\"Versus\\". However, the second album (Riot on an Empty Street) is a blast!  <br /> <br />Kings of Convenience's music is almost accoustic - stripped bare except for some guitar and orchestral arrangement. Some of the songs are a bit up-tempo with electronica added in. The album has that lazy, smooth chill-out atmosphere to it. <br /> <br />The duo (Erlend ye and Eirik Glambek Be) sing harmoniously with witty lyrics and great arrangement. Listen to \\"I'd Rather Dance with You\\", for example. There are a lot of songs that I like from this album, but I particularly love a line from the first song in the album, \\"Homesick\\" - \\"A song for someone who needs somewhere to long for. Homesick. Because I no longer know where home is.\\" How true. <br /> <br />Go and get this album - Kings of Convenience is one of Norway's best kept secrets!
B00000272N|5.0|u idiot!!Godsmack tries 2 copy alice in chains style very much. hell they got their name from a song of thier \\"dirt\\" cd. Godsmack is no wear neat as good and talented as AIC and never will b. R.I.P. Layne Staley
B000001H00|5.0|Before buying this recording, I had not heard or heard of Nathan Milstein; now that I have I thank God I was allowed to hear him before I die. It is not the only recording of the Bach solo violin music worth knowing, but it is a must-have if you love it.    The sheer energy of these performances is remarkable, and it is not generated exclusively by tempo; what should be fast is fast, and what should be slow is slow. Milstein's tone is beautiful, clear and warm, and well-presented by the DG engineers. I am convinced by his phrasing, although I am no expert on this matter. There are one or two places where his intonation wavers just a trifle, but I don't mind that; utterly perfect performances usually bore me. I will accept a couple surface flaws if the performance is intellectually exciting or emotionally involving, and Milstein's is both.    One key consideration in any complete recording of Bach's solo violin music is how the performer handles the D-minor partita; some will mentally \\"detach\\" the Chaconne and think about it independently of the other movements, which makes the partita as a whole suffer. Milstein does not make this mistake; the Chaconne feels like it really *does* belong with the other movements.    An excellent recording. Not definitive, but then I don't think you can have a single definitive performance of this glorious music.
B000002L9J|5.0|Absolute brilliance.  \\"The Queen is Dead\\" is my favorite Smiths album; it's impossible to find a flaw anywhere.  A recording that effortlessy trounces 99 percent of anything released today.    A masterful work of brooding pop that is uplifting.  It is the recording that sums up the \\"original\\" alternative scene; a time when overlooked music like this was appreciated by a select few.    It's a CD that demands to be played in its entirety each and every time.  If I had to pick a favorite, it would be \\"Cemetry Gates\\".    One of the greatest albums of not only the 80s, but of all time.
6305327084|5.0|I saw this once back when it first came out around 1996. Recently, I watched it again. Sometimes when you watch a movie a second time, you're disappointed. I wasn't at all. If anything, I was depressed after it was over because I had to stop watching.  <br /> <br />This movie is \\"superb,\\" to quote one of the characters who overuses the word. It explores the woman problems of a group of friends who grew up together in a small town and, in doing so, makes some interesting observations about why it's so difficult for some people to feel completely satisfied with a relationship. <br /> <br />It's one of a small number of films that give you a glimpse of authentic contemporary America -- something you're not going to get from most Hollywood films.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|I wasn't sure about this movie at first, but no regrets here.  This movie is hilarious!  It's funny, has a good storyline, and good character development.  I enjoyed it from beginning to end, even the end is good!  I recommend renting this one.  I'm going to buy the DVD for our collection, it's a classic! <br />
B0002858YS|5.0|\\"Hot Fuss\\" is the catchiest album that came out this year, period.  It's kind of a throwback album that takes us back to the 80's when dance and synth rock were prominent, yet it has a modern twist to it.  Songs like \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" and \\"Smile Like You Mean It,\\" have you singing right along with Brandon Flowers from beginning to end, whereas \\"On Top,\\" and \\"Midnight Show,\\" put you in a clublike atmosphere where you can't help but shake your money maker.  If you haven't listened to The Killers before, then I suggest you give them a try.  If you already dig The Killers, I suggest that you check out B-Sides \\"Under the Gun,\\" and \\"Why Don't You Find Out For Yourself.\\"
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I picked up these DVD's based on a friend's recommendation. I was reluctant at first because I knew this show was cancelled after only a brief run and I assumed that meant it wasn't very good. I am now simply stunned at both the quality of this show and Fox's stupidity. This show has everything an intelligent science-fiction fan wants- great writing, great acting, interesting situations and sympathetic characters. The ensemble nature of the cast is outstanding. The different characters are extremely well-defined, unlike other shows such as Voyager. The whole \\"Wild West in Space\\" theme sounds hokey but really works, due to the talent involved. And the music is both memorable and effective. <br /> <br />I cannot recommend this set highly enough. It's such a shame it's so small. I understand there is a movie version of Firefly in the works and I hope it lives up to the series. Better still, I hope it inspires another network to bring the cast back together for a new series.  <br /> <br />Buy this.
B000050FEN|5.0|While many people see this movie as a 'Silence of the Lambs' style psychological horror movie (and being overly grotesque abd graphical for some) - the horror is just a minor aspect of the movie. In a way, it is just a metaphore for our lives today.<br /><br />The movir centers on the relationship between supposedly opposite detectives - David Mills (Brad Pitt) is still young enough (and inexperienced enough in big city crime)to believe the system works, and that most criminals can be caught if the cops & detectives involved will work hard enough. Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman), on the other hand, had more than his share of unsolved, grotesque cases to be weary of the system. His definition of a 'closed case' is when there is nothing more to be done - whether the perpertrator has been caught, or in many of the cases - until there is no way of finding him or her. He's also experienced enough to know that hard work is often not enough, and that the wheels of justiced can work better if they're greased with some bribes somewhere along the way. Unlike Det. Mills, who fights the despair he sees around him by tryingto do his best, Det. Somerset just decide to give up - with so much crime going on around him, what can he do to stop it?<br /><br />The movie assaults our sense of 'right and wrong'. Just like Det. Mills, we'd like to think everything can be resolved with logic - but are all logical decisions right decisions? The scene between Tracy & Somerset in the diner tries to tell us the opposite.<br /><br />As the movie progresses, the relationship between the two detectives is getting better - not only are they becoming friends, but also manage to find a way to work well together, and to feed off each other's strength & talents. But this doesn't lead to a happy ending - even though the crime is solved. As the relationship gets better, the murders are becoming stranger, exposing us to seedier & seedier sides of life in the big city.<br /><br />Looking at the way the movie is shot, NYC is always rainy, wet, neglected. This depressing atmosphere affects the lives of everyone living in it. Even the supposedly 'perfect' relationship between David & Tracy (the highschool sweethearts we'd all like to be) had somehow gone wrong - starting with the 'vibrating apartment', and going through a stage where Tracy doesn't share the secret of herpregnancy & her doubts about it with David.<br /><br />The ending, on the other hand, occurs in a big, sunny field - the exact opposite of the wet city the characters had just left. But while the city was 'their turf', where they were in control, John Doe is in control of the situation in the field. Once again, our ideals of good & bad (crowded, wet city vs. the big, sunny countryside) are somehow used against us.
B00005JKED|4.0|This movie seethes with darkness. Denzel Washington gleefully as his character by the name of Alonzo Harris. Ethan Hawke plays Jake, the wide-eyed eager-to-please rookie that will do whatever it takes to join Alonzo's elite narcotics team. <br /> <br />The story is about two men who will go to almost any length to get what they want. Alonzo is basically a criminal with a badge, out to get other criminals by any means necessary, yet putting his own needs before the \\"sheep\\" he claims to protect. Jake wants to make detective, and follows Alonzo around doing his bidding to gain that coveted badge. <br /> <br />The story takes place in one day - because that's all Jake has to prove to Alonzo he's worthy of the job. It's a dreary rainy day in Los Angeles, a perfect way to emphasize the darkness possessed by Alonzo's soul. He is a man on a mission, and with his badge and bravado he rules the streets of LA. <br /> <br />Without giving anything away, the two actors are magnificent in this film. Both of them are completely believable in their roles. As a viewer, you sometimes find yourself agreeing with and sympathizing with Alonzo as he takes Jake down the dark road that lies ahead of them - until the end. <br /> <br />Denzel Washington won his first Academy Award as Best Actor (he won for Best Supporting Actor in Glory) playing the role of Alonzo. The film definitely stretches the boundaries of believability, but the acting and the enthralling storyline makes this a forgivable sin as we immerse ourselves in the darkness of Alonzo Harris for one day.

B00003CXXM|4.0|I enjoy a genre of film I like to call \\"the smart thriller.\\" The smart thriller is one that has good characters, good action, a good story, and most importantly - it does not force me to strain my disbelief. The Bourne Identity is such a film. <br /> <br />Matt Damon does a fine job playing the part of Jason Bourne, and after two movies now I can't see another actor playing the part. He  brings a believability to the role that the last string of James Bond movies sadly lacks. <br /> <br />This movie creates a character we would think the ultimate spy would be. While he is intelligent, he does not rely on gadgets or technology. He is quick with his wits and his fists and he is always cool while under fire or in danger. He is an ultra-professional and meticulous in his attention to detail.  <br /> <br />I found the martial arts in this film refreshingly different and interesting to watch. Nobody goes flying into walls or gets knocked out with a chop to the neck. The fights are lengthy, brutal, and exciting to watch. The director also takes care to keep the camera back so we can actually see the actors doing the moves, something many modern movies are relutant to do because it's easier to do close-ups and fancy editing when an actor doesn't really have the skills. <br /> <br />Matt Damon, along with a fine ensemble cast, carries the movie and leaves us wanting more when it's finally over. A very smart thriller with enough action to keep your blood pumping, The Bourne Identity delivers.
B00005JNEI|1.0|I was going to vote for John Kerry until about 2 months before the presidential election. After putting it off for some time, I finally watched this film and was disgusted by how contrived it is. Bowling for Columbine is interesting except for the parts where he uses fake camera angles and all. This is just a big pack of one-sided distortions. Like I said, I was all for Kerry, but it was a bunch of little things like the Michael Moores and all the other libs going nuts and pumping lies into the tv that really turned me off. I look forward to his next film. It'll push me to vote republican again probably.
B000784WMW|3.0|When the screenwriters adapted Robert Stevenson's \\"Jane Eyre,\\" they had to leave everything out that couldn't be condensed.  The mini-series approach, however, allows ample time to study the characters in depth. In my 29 years, I recall not one, but *two* BBC TV mini-series adaptations of Jane Eyre that played in the early 1980s.  These attempted to portray the book as a complete experience.  I won't judge which of the two is more definitive, having only read part of the book.     The 1983 one, released to VHS/DVD, starred Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke. Some reviewers have commented on how well Sian Pattenden portrays young Jane, mistreated by her aunt Reed's family and at Lowood school. This is the first hour of the series, and I was riveted. When Jane is grown and Rochester arrives, Clarke and Dalton do the work justice - they're just not as much fun to watch as their counterparts in the 1973 mini-series.    The 1973 series starred Michael Jayston and Sorcha Cusack. The series is excellent, almost to the point where I'd call it treachery that it's not available either on VHS or DVD. This was no minor production: in fact, it played in the States on PBS up to ten years after its original broadcast.    Dalton's Rochester seemed at times too leaden and serious, almost a caricature. It's probably not necessary to blow this aspect of Rochester out of proportion. Jayston plays Rochester as a bitter man with a secret thorn in his side, but balances sardonic wit with what's been called a \\"poetic imagination.\\" Check this out when Rochester is explaining his secret to Jane. You may find Jayston on record as saying that Rochester was his favorite television role. His enthusiasm for the part is obvious. Clarke's Jane is plain, and seeks independence, love and servitude, but it's a little harder to see where the fire in Jane Eyre comes from. It's not so much Clarke was a bit too good-looking, although that may be. Cusack, an Irish actress, is irresistable in more ways than one.  A governess who must mind her boundaries as a subordinate, she converses on would-be equal terms with Rochester, trading jabs, despite the difference in age and experience.  Thus, in the early scenes, we get a good sense of Jane Eyre's spiritedness (even though we might not have seen the part about her childhood). The interaction of Dalton and Clarke, while fine, falls short of some of these bonus characteristics.    Other things to note: the first episode of the 5-part 1973 series was seldom shown outside of the UK.  The memorable theme music was the passionate \\"Introduction and Allegro\\" composed by one of Britain's greatest, Sir Edward Elgar.  My approbation goes to the director Joan Craft, the screenwriter, Robin Chapman, and to the cast:  Megs Jenkins (Mrs. Fairfax), Stephanie Beacham (Blanche Ingram), Geoffrey Whitehead (St. John Rivers), Susan Brodrick (Mary Rivers), Caroline Harris (Diana Rivers), Edward De Souza (Richard Mason), and the rest.          It's unfortunate that few people will have the opportunity to see both series to compare them. \\"Jane Eyre\\" is a classic novel. Many different adaptations of it are currently for sale. In fact, it appears some extremely poor adaptations of it are for sale, now. Even uncharitable people must acknowledge the 1973 version of \\"Jane Eyre\\" is not \\"bad,\\" and had a good run before the BBC decided to produce a new series for 1983.    If you write to the powers-that-be, BBC America or BBC Worldwide, they'd be able to estimate the market potential of a video release. Go ahead and give it a try. Both mini-series are good television productions and should be distributed.
B0002KQNL8|4.0|Yes finally ROTLD 2 is released on DVD! And I'm also surprised and glad that there is a commentary track, but be warned, it is slightly different. The music is different. I'm very disappointed by the crap music track that has replaced the original. The director on the commentary also points this out about the replacement with this dreadful musical score. <br /> <br />I love the original score to this film. Lucky I had the video version transfered onto DVD, so one might want to consider doing that. But most definitely buy this DVD for the commentary. It's a good listen from the director and one of the actors from the film. <br /> <br />All in all, I LOVE the Return of the Living Dead series!
B00008J2PG|4.0|\\"All that is required for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing.\\" So Msr. O'Flaherty and co. do something.  This story, which I am astonished to be learning for the first time (my father, being Irish, Catholic and in WWII should have been bragging of this all my life) is one of the best I have ever heard or read.  What a ripping yarn, and it's not only true but from background reading even better than what's in the movie.  There are no words for the completely redemptive, God-glorifying quality of this tale and even the movie.  But, and it's a small but - I don't care if Peck has a passing weak Irish accent.  To be accurate, Gielgud would be speaking Italian and Plummer German, so put that out of your mind completely. Its small failings are - it is too long.  (2 1/2 hours)  It is worth the time, but things that could be told really well have not been, you can sense it from what you see - and other things are lingered over that could be cut effectively.  Maybe I am looking for Hollywood\\"drama\\" and this is more realistic, I'm not sure. I've sat through all 3 Lord of the Rings (also too long)and doubt I would rewatch them.  This is one I'd watch several more times, and it would be more watchable if it were a half hour shorter.  As far as rating and younger children - if they have reached the age to learn anything about the war, I don't think you could do better than letting them see there were people fighting that evil who didn't carry guns.
0684801558|4.0|To begin with, I need to say that this is no \\"Great Gatsby.\\" Having said that, I will give my opinion of F. Scott Fitzgerald's, \\"The Beautiful and the Damned.\\" It is a very good example of two lives lived without faith in God. Instead, Anthony Patch places his faith in millions he expects to inherit, while his wife has faith in the money and her beauty. It is clear that Fitzgerald writes from experience as he describes many of the struggles of becoming a writer as well as the struggle with alcoholism. Anthony Patch fully expected to inherit millions from his religiously devout uncle. His uncle disinherited him because of his immoral behavior and Anthony and Gloria end up in a desperate lawsuit throughout the book, hoping to change the courts initial decision. In that process, they are on a downward spiral in their relationship, relationships with friends, and their self esteem. I was reminded of the Biblical story of Job as I read the book. As Job had it all in the beginning, so did Anthony. As Job had it all taken away, so did Anthony. As Job's friends looked down upon him in his condition, so did Anthony's friends. Even Job's wife turned on him. Anthony's wife despised him as well. Then comes the difference. Job never lost faith in his God, but Anthony Patch never had faith. In the end, Job was rewarded with more blessings than he had ever had before. At the end of Anthony Patch's life, he got the blessing he had always longed for, but he was too far gone to enjoy it. I found it sad and depressing at times but it is worth the read. It's a look into the life of Fitzgerald and the age of World War I. It also reminds us that we can have all the world's goods and still have nothing, if we have ignored God in this life.
B000002GB2|5.0|First of all, Equinox was not the first album from Styx, they were around for four albums on the Wooden Nickel label (part of the RCA family of labels and not an independent label as someone else stated) but it was a major stepping stone to their arena superstar status (Tommy Shaw would replace John Curulewski and change things for this band on their next album Crystal Ball). I felt the hairs on the back of my neck roll up when I read someone's comment that \\"Suite Madame Blue\\" was a \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" ripoff...simply not true at all. Some people have nothing better to do than try to take something away from a song that simply was beyond compare in concert and showed what this band was truly capable of. This was their fifth album, true...but for a lot of new fans, to quote another band from their fair city, this was \\"only the beginning\\". Check out \\"Born for Adventure\\" and \\"Midnight Ride\\" and you've got an idea of why these guys were as big as they continue to be 30 years later. Styx a Zeppelin ripoff? Pardon me, but haven't you got more important things to be concerned with? <br />
B000002LPD|5.0|I know some people pander this album simply because it is Van Hagar, but they're missing out on a near-classic.  Alongside with 5150, this is their strongest work with Sammy.  Also, this is probably the one they hit the hardest with (post Roth, of couse), if that concerns any of you.  From Poundcake to Top Of The World, the album has no weak points or boring moments, just quality music.  It's bittersweet to know that this album was really the last great thing they released.  Not for the first time listener because it is sort of a departure from the \\"Classic\\" VH, but if you have a few already, get this one.  You'll be saying what the initials of the album title spell in amazement.
B00003CXSP|5.0|I was kind of disappointed by the film at first because it cuts off the second half of the book, the part I definitely preferred because it showed so well there is a real love affair going on between the criminal and the cop who is tracking him. Catching a serial killer is the story of a seduction : the seducing of the cop and the seducing of the killer by the other proponent in each case. But the film has qualities that are undeniable. It is a good thriller, though a little bit fast and consequently skimpy.<br /><br />The end is gross, even if the alternative ending is a lot better, because it keeps the main door open. The official ending closes all doors and locks them up so tight there is no escape from the horror this Hannibal inspires in Clarisse, respect, maybe or of course, but horror all the same. It explores a little bit the extreme culture of this man, his phenomenal way to impersonate practically anyone and charm practically any audience.<br /><br />He is a man who can be on the alert all the time and knows what his opponents are going to do next, even before they know themselves. It is funny how he is not at all disquieted by his being caught by his old high school or university gay offering to the God of death and style, because he knows this Mason has made a mistake : he has called him back by endangering Clarisse and she will know why she has been endangered and by whom, and she will react according to her instinct, she will come after him, Hannibal, because she cannot even doubt he is at stake and she was the bait, and she has to capture him alive, hence to go into the hornet's nest to get him free and then arrest him.<br /><br />That is not going to work exactly like that but the reducing of the rotten justice department offcial to a mumbling kid if not baboon is such a nice thing to see. A young promising man who cannot resist his fascination for easy money and endangers his own colleagues, even uses them as bait and nothing but trap-meat. That is what our system of containing evil instead of reforming it leads to. There is always someone who will take advantage of the situation. That is western corruption and we are experts at it. At the same time this film, for the second time (Red Dragon proved the contrary but The Silence of the Lambs went the opposite way), proves that the famous FBI profiling technique is just a gimmick in the technology of crime-fighting and nothing else.<br /><br />A real serial killer is intelligent enough to foresee what the police is going to do and thus to lead them along the way instead of being trapped by their profiling. A real serial killer is also able to check all computers and sites and know that someone has put their greasy fingers in some files that concern him. If he buys a certain perfume in some luxury boutique anywhere in the world, he wants it to be an indicator of his whereabout to get out of the police what he wants, because he knows there is a camera filming hom and a simple mirror will tell him he is being watched. And he always succeeds because teh police works serially too and very little creatively. He does not want to stay in hiding.<br /><br />He wants to come out and act, so he calculates the action he desires and wishes and he pulls all the strings. It is a shame that the film cuts off the second part of the book and makes it impossible for Hannibal to get out of the chase, but it is a good film and the book is quite different with a serial killer who finally wants to get out of it and tries, maybe succeeds, to do so. Watch and enjoy the film, then read the book and enjoy the difference. Then enjoy the second disk, the alternative or rejected scenes (probably not all of them), the making of, and many other elements. You'll learn a lot about filmmaking and that will give some depth to your pleasure.<br /><br />We are finally reaching the acme of visual art by being provided with the backstage scenes and the backroom discussions. The cinema with the DVD is becoming like the Bible with the fingerprints of Jesus and his full authentic biography certified by the Roman Emperor himself and at least two dozens of eye-witnesses testifying under oath in some Supreme Court of Historical Truth.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAUts of Jesus and his full authentic biography certified by the Roman Emperor himself and at least two dozens of eye-witnesses testifying under oath in some Supreme Court of Historical Truth.

B00064MW6A|4.0|Catwoman is about a woman named patience, who is killed after accidentally overhearing a conversation about a new product having long-lasting side affects on the people who use the product. When she dies, Midnight,a rare egyptian cat, gives her special powers. The next morning, she wakes up with no rememberence of what happened the night before. In fact, she does'nt even know she died until she makes a visit to Midnight's owner who tells her what happened to her. At first, she thinks the woman is crazy until the lady proves it to her. That's when she goes on her quest to seek revenge on her killer. While doing so, she falls for a detective who finally discovers who she really is. Human by day, cat by night. Soon, Patience/Catwoman in arrested for a series of murders, and she breaks out to prove her innocence. All in all, I'd say it was a great movie. My only complaints are that the movie took way to long to get to the point, and there were lots of parts that had nothing to do with the movie.
B00008NV4I|3.0|One the one hand, it was rather refreshing to have a Romulan-themed story in quite a long time. The action sequences are super and the effects shots are great. <br />On the other hand, this latest (last?) Trek installment did leave this reviewer with several questions. Why did Wesley Crusher show up at First Officer William Riker and Counselor Diana Troi's pre-wedding banquet (see TheNextGeneration episode \\"Journey's End\\") ? What is Worf doing on board the Enterprise-E (see DeepSpaceNine series ender \\"What You Leave Behind II\\") ? And with Data ceasing to exist as a sentient being (he is said to have been killed off though he never in fact lived) and hence unable to assume the role of Second in Command, who then would assume Riker's role -  Geordi, Worf, or someone else?<br />Part of the blame for this movie's dismal box office performance must rest with the studio, both for releasing it up against \\"Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers\\" and deleting at least 41 minutes of filmed material. Having said all this, the movie itself comes up somewhat short indeed. The main flaw seems to be that it never sufficiently delves into the cause(s) for Shinzon's anger and enmity towards Picard and the whole human race. After all, was it not the Romulans who treated him so shabbily all these years?<br />It is far from certain if a feature-length story featuring DSN characters will be made, either with a few crossover characters from TNG or none. However, given the unexpectedly weak showing at the box office for this film and the less-than spectacular track record of its preceding films (only one is said to have reached the US$100M threshold) it is highly unlikely that there will be any more Star Trek theatrical movies; The Wrath of Khan, a film from which this one is unjustly accused of ripping off, nearly became a non-theatrical movie.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I only caught a fraction of one episode on TV (\\"War Stories\\") by accident but it was enough to get me to look up the show (I had never even heard of it) on TV Tome which, in turn, lead me to Amazon where I read the many gushing reviews. They were enough to convince me to go out and buy the boxed set.  <br /> <br />I found I watched the entire series (plus the extras) over the last weekend and was eager to watch the entire thing in one sitting (which circumstances did not allow alas). The show has certain unmistakeable Whedon elements most notably in evidence is his skill at rapidly developing well drawn, sympathetic, deep and intriguingly flawed central characters who all have a sense of humor.  <br /> <br />When watching these episodes I had the most amazing sense of reliving some of the sensations I felt as a 13 year old watching the original Star Wars in 1977. The two are completely different, of course, but there was something about the inhospitable western landscapes and the grittiness of planets on the edge of the populated universe that was as compelling and attractive as anything depicted in the first Star Wars flick (and this was achieved with nary an alien or android in sight!).  <br /> <br />In Firefly in every episode there is a real sense of a wide, complex universe, a place of wild undiscovered frontiers and of  turbulent and interesting times throbbing away just beneath the surface as our protagonists go about their adventures trying to keep their heads down and avoid a run in with the dreaded \\"Alliance\\" (an entity with nice echoes (right down to the funky uniforms) of the \\"Empire\\" from the first Star Wars film - but without the cheesy self parody that infected Mr Lucas's subsequent take on it). <br /> <br />Also unlike the simplistic evil empire versus good rebels scenario conjured up in Star Wars we get an empire that is more ambiguous (ie much more credible and interesting) in Firefly.  The Alliance is painted as somewhat benign and possibly even aforce for good but which harbors within its huge girth some sinister and hidden elements outside the apparent control of the Alliance (not unlike that which exists in real bodies politic in the actual universe we live in). Even the main characters are morally ambiguous at times through necessity.  There is great resonance in the real world. This conveying of social and political depth in a future universe, of the \\"grey\\" areas where actions are played out by flawed and desperate humans against a complex and morally amiguous backdrop is almost never successfully captured in Sci-Fi (compare with the simplistic and largerly one dimensional \\"federation\\" of the Star Trek Universe). That Whedon could achieve what Star Trek has not and to do that in only a handful of episodes gives a glimpse of where this show could have gone had it been given a chance).  <br /> <br />The CGI effects in Firefly are effective and used when needed to advance the story. They look good (and I love the fact that everything depicted in space is silent - just as it would be in reality in a vacumn). The effects are always used intelligently and subtly (a lesson Mr Lucas seems to have forgotten in all his cinematic efforts after Star Wars Ep 4).       <br /> <br />It is, of course, to Fox's great discredit that the bean counters axed this show before anybody even knew it was there let alone before a following was allowed to build as it inevitably would have over time. You would have thought with Whedon's track record he would have been allowed at least an entire series before the axe came down. I seem to recall Buffy wasn't an instant hit either. <br /> <br />Part of the reason for my adding this otherwise redundant review to the plethora of other favourable reviews is to stick it to Fox. As I understand it the boxed set has sold gangbusters since going on sale.  Glad to hear it although it cheeses me to think Fox is cashing in on a project they killed off prematurely.  I hope the movie version does go ahead as the gossip seems to suggest.  It is even a remote possibility the series might be revived if the movie is a success although I suspect the actors have probably moved onto other things by now - they have to eat after all.   <br /> <br />We can but hope because this is surely one of the best conceived and best executed series (Sci-Fi or otherwise) ever to have been trashed before even ending its first season.  A travesty which leaves me scratching my head and longing for the day when all TV programs will be aired and viewed on a pay-per-view basis over the internet. Imagine a time in the not too distant future when shows like Firefly can be streamed to tens of millions of aficionados world wide who each pay a few cents for the privilege thus ensuring such a show a future.  No question of premature axings based on suspect ratings figures when that eventually is reality. <br /> <br />I hope my addition to this avalanche of positive reviews encourages a couple more people to risk shelling out to buy this very enjoyable series because that might just be enough to influence those Fox bean counters to resurrect this tremendous show.  This set is a definite keeper in my book.
B000060P79|3.0|Not trying to bash this genre, but Blink-182, Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, New Found Glory, etc, sound exactly the same.  They are all 'pop-punk' trying their hardest to be hardcore.  The catchy music and pathetic lyrics in this album will get stuck in your head, and before you know it, you'll be singing along to the music..but please, don't let too many people know you're listening to Simple Plan.  I suggest you burn this CD from your little sister and only play it if you're sure no one's around, but if you want to listen to REAL punk, I suggest some Blanks 77 or The New York Dolls.
0767834739|5.0|I enjoyed the first movie, and gave it 3 stars, but this sequel truly blows the first away.<br /><br />This movie is nothing but pure, fast, non stop action, and will definitely not be mixed up as an Oscar caliber movie. But theres nothing bad about that.<br /><br />Milla looks even better in this movie than the first and her new co-star, Jill, is as hot as they come. The action between the two main females and Nemesis was definitely fun to watch.<br /><br />The best thing about the movie is that it never lets up and leaves you bored. Its a short movie at 90 something minutes but every minute is worthwhile.<br /><br />And LJ, from the Friday movies, was histerical in this movie. Every line he had was funny as heck.<br /><br />And the special features of this dvd really go over the top. The featurettes were wonderful, the outtakes were hilarious, and the deleted scenes were cool in their own way.<br /><br />As a whole package this dvd is definitely one of the best and this movie is one of the biggest guilty pleasures of all time.
B00000099Y|3.0|These Amazon pop music reviews are so hilariously moronic. it doesn't matter what CD you browse, the great majority of the contents of the review read as thus: <br /> <br /> <br />(Sycophantic reviewer #1): This is the best album of all time! You must buy this album! It's incredible! 5 stars! <br /> <br />(Fan of other band): This band is rubbish. Go listen to ( insert random band name). They're way better than this band! 1 star! <br /> <br />(Sycophantic reviewer #2) Fan of other band is an idiot/ needs to die! Ignore anyone who gives this album 1 star! This is a 5 star album! <br /> <br /> <br />That's basically it. And nothing illustrates it better than Aenima by Tool. I hope at some point they'll come up with \\"Amazon Music review- The Opera\\" because it would really pull in the crowds who want a laugh. Is it a new phenomenon? No, because I've browsed through music mags of about 20 yars ago, and readers letters follows the same pattern of praise/ slamming/praise, repeat ad infinitum. But Amazon has elevated it to comic perfection. In truth I don't like nor dislike Tool, so...3 stars.

0679722610|3.0|'Red Harvest' starts off so well, much like a Raymond Chandler novel.  A man is murdered under strange circumstances, with his intriguingly strange family members being either suspects or wanting revenge.  In waltzes a private investigator, ala Philip Marlowe, who seems tough, street-wise, and does well with the ladies.  Oh, and the lingo throughout is very 1930s tough guy talk.  However 'Red Harvest' ultimately sinks into mediocrity.  Why? <br /> <br />Firstly, Dashiell Hammett spins an overly complex story with way too many characters ... into what is a very short book.  Too many killings, too much action, very little coherence.  While the story sort of pulls itself together in the end I find myself ultimately bored, and disappointed, with the entire effort. <br /> <br /> <br />Bottom line:  not an enjoyable reading experience.
B0001ENY6M|5.0|I went to see this movie, not because I wanted to see all the blood, but I figured if Mel Gibson were to do this right then the music should be exceptional. I was right. Debney's score is inspiring, especially for someone like myself who would love to be in his shoes someday. Music like this is not necessarily just written in two short weeks, like many scores are done. This required a good deal of research, as per the instruments, the voices, the musical modes and structures, and a little influence from the awesome peter gabriel. This is a great film score, and in addition, how often do you find that an original film score can also stand alone and be sold in the world music section of a CD store?

B0002X314C|5.0|When I heard this album, I was completely blown away. John Legend has a very distinct style and sound. And he defines it well on this album. No one has the same cadence or rhythm that this guy does. Trust me, he stands out. Once you hear it, you won't easily forget. His songs are so well crafted and self-assured. And fittingly, he will be opening up for Alicia Keys on her upcoming Diary Tour. That's one stellar combination. It doesn't get much better. <br /> <br />This album at times is dynamic and at others incredibly subtle. That's part of the John Legend magic. His voice alone shows great imagination. He's able to create such unique and interesting layers and textures. Mr. Legend's voice isn't one dimensional. He knows when and where to accentuate every line of each song.  <br /> <br />I have very few albums where the energy resonates so strongly. I feel like I'm in a better place mentally after listening to this record. It is a classic because it captures the same quality and elegance that the vintage R&B records did. Most of the contemporary stuff just stays on the surface and never quite sinks in. This album goes deeper. It does more than move, it lifts. <br /> <br />1.) Prelude 5/5, 2.) Let's Get Lifted 5/5, 3.) Used to Love You 5/5, 4.) Alright 5/5, 5.) She Don't Have to Know 5/5, 6. Number One 4/5, 7.) I can Change 5/5, 8. )Ordinary People 4/5, 9.) Stay With You 5/5, 10.) Let's Get Lifted Again 4/5, 11.)So High 4/5, 12.) Refuge [When It's Cold Outside] 5/5, 13.) It Don't Have to Change, 14.) Live It Up 5/5 <br /> <br /> <br />
B000005IU2|2.0|I drove down my street while enjoying the delicate taste of a Parliament Light, I listened to this album, and I almost drove off the road and off of a cliff that led into a cavern of never-before seen or understood musically delirious pleasure.  To call this house of Stooges \\"fun\\" is like calling hunger a symptom of fatigue.  To say the least, in this album Iggy presents an ultimatum to existence.  Either you remain a futile specimen of audio simplicity, or you fall backward onto a bed of nails that hold a fantastically psychadelic elicxer of auditory sensuality.
B000148KK2|5.0|Diana's newest album is a gem. She has matured and so has her music. All of her early fans who are bemoaning her change of direction are the type of fan who booed Bob Dylan when he first appeared on stage with an electric guitar. True art, which is the best art, is not static. Is there anyone who wishes that Picasso had stuck with his early realism phase and not evolved over time? In one of her songs Diana sings of a change of address; perhaps her original fans need to move forward with her. Yes, I agree that Elvis Costello has been a major influence. Men can be muses too, you know.
B0002DKCMQ|5.0|Eurotrip isnt a \\"profound, lifechanging\\" movie, its a movie that you watch when you are having a crappy day.   Its hilarious! Its supposed to make you laugh and it does, about a million times. If you want to watch a great movie, watch Eurotrip
1400032717|5.0|As a teacher, I have taught some students who are considered autistic and also who have Asperger's which is considered a high functioning form of autism.  That the author is not autistic continues to blow my mind.  Reading through the first 100 pages, I was pretty sure I was inside the head of the many students I have just mentioned.  He explains so vividly what it's like to live as an autistic person with so much information and stimulation happening every second in this ultra modern world.<br /><br />I found the first part of the book very entertaining and very on the mark.  THe second half really developed into a story and I was amazed at how the character overcomes some fears and tries to deal with life situations that even someone without autism doesn't really know how to handle.  I cannot recommend this book enough, especially to those who are aware of autism and have contact with those who are.
B000000W5F|3.0|This is a very good album.  The Stones of the 60's and early 70's would have been proud    Tattoo You has a classic song in Start Me Up, several AWESOME songs like Neighbors, Hang Fire, Waiting On a Friend.  Not a bad song on this album.    I gave it 4 stars but I accidentally hit 3.  Sorry   IT DESERVES 4-5 stars though.
B00006HBUC|5.0|This is a great live version of the SCOOBY-DOO cartoon- with some twists. For example, the cartoon's Daphne is cowardly, but here she finds her strength and kicks some serious tail. The story revolves around a request from the owner of Spooky Island, an amusement center, for the detective team of Mystery, Inc., which had disbanded, to reunite and help him find the cause of some unfortunate events that have happened there. Of course, they succeed. This movie is great for anyone 10 or older.
B000000W5P|4.0|Considered one of the better Stones albums of the Ron Wood era, this album is okay, with several classic songs but all in all, very average compared to their better works with Brian Jones and Mick Taylor (Wood's predecessors). <br /> <br />The album opens with the disco song \\"Miss You\\", which is surprisingly an awesome song, if a bit wimpy.  I prefer the Forty Licks version of the song, though, rather than the track on Some Girls. <br /> <br />\\"Just My Imagination\\" and \\"Respectable\\" are okay, and \\"Far Away Eyes\\" is great on some parts, but it is very uneven with Jagger talking through some of it, but it does have it's highs. <br /> <br />By far, the best track is \\"Beast of Burden\\".  This classic has great lyrics, emotional vocals, a true rock and roll feel that is usually missing from this album, and of course good music work by the band.  As with \\"Miss You\\", I like the 40 Licks track of \\"Beast of Burden\\". <br /> <br />\\"Shattered\\" is also a good song, and seems to evoke a sense of techno.  The lyrics and Jagger's vocals are the main attraction to the sogn, though. <br /> <br />Other tracks, like \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\" and \\"Some Girls\\" bring down the album.  I find \\"Some Girls\\" very boring and slow, and with horrible lyrics. <br /> <br />Over all, with songs like \\"Miss You\\" and \\"Beast of Burden\\", this album does have it's highs, and with others like \\"Some Girls\\" and \\"When the Whip Comes Down\\", the album has it's lows. <br /> <br />Ranking with the other albums, I'd put \\"Some Girls\\" above such albums like Dirty Work, Black and Blue, Exile on Main St., but below Sticky Fingers, Beggar's Banquet, and Let it Bleed.
B000002L9B|5.0|This album that accompanies the movie Under the Cherry Moon is a MUST-HAVE Prince album whether you love the movie or not.  Not only should you own this album because it has one of the most popular Prince songs of all time, \\"Kiss\\", but it also contains many other absolutely AMAZING songs, such as \\"Mountains\\", \\"Girls & Boys\\", \\"Sometimes it Snows in April\\", and \\"Anotherloverholenyohead\\", that were thoughtlessly left off of Prince's Hits albums becasue of the movie's overall unsuccess. <br /> <br />1.)  \\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\\" is a cute, circus-sounding jam with fun melody and lyrics that start the album off on an upbeat track. <br /> <br />2.)  \\"New Position\\" is a great classic old-school sounding song, a familiar Prince vibe, and a truly fun song that has you grinning at the sound of Prince's \\"Honey!\\"'s. :) <br /> <br />3.)  \\"I Wonder U\\" is a mellow hit that had me wishing it was longer until I realized the length truly made it a greater song. <br /> <br />4.)  Yes, the fantastic \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\".  The intro is so great!  I love the way this song sounds.  It's just so romantic and classic.  The music has me thinking I've heard it before...  His voice also sounds very nice and dramatic, to really make you feel the song. <br /> <br />5.)  \\"Girls & Boys\\".  The sexy and fun song that helped me to want to purchase this album, along with the great video I absolutely love!  Shot in black and white with Prince shakin' his thing...oh, we're talking about the album here.  Right. <br /> <br />6.)  \\"Life Can Be So Nice\\", and life really can be so nice when listening to this album!  This is the most cheerful song on the album, to me.  Some say that this song is too clashed, but it's really a great song.  Different yet familiar. <br /> <br />7.)  Prince's first instrumental on an album, Venus de Milo is a greatly composed song.  This man has some serious skills.  A masterpiece! <br /> <br />8.)  \\"Mountains\\".  The drums and horns on this track are excellent.  His falsetto is great (as usual) and this is really a jammin' song.  Highly recommended if not anything else. <br /> <br />9.)  \\"Do U Lie?\\" my favorite song when I first purchased it, and I still love it.  I really love the way he sounds on this song.  Mellow and fun. <br /> <br />10.)  ....\\"Kiss\\"!  I'm going to be honest.  I have heard this album basically since in the womb (I'm an 80's-born baby) and I always considered it a nice song.  But it wasn't until last year before I purchased the album that I listened to it, and something clicked!  I LOVE THIS SONG!!  Before, I figured, \\"hey, it's just a mainstream Prince song.  Everybody loves it,\\"  but now I can't live without it!  I still have to press the 'repeat' button after hearing this funky song.  (The video is my FAVORITE, too.) :) <br /> <br />11.)  Wow.  Brilliance throughout this album.  \\"Anotherloverholenyohead\\" is just amazing.  I read the song's title and was like, \\"I know this will be funky.\\"  I was right.  It has a mellow groove to it, and it has a sound that keeps me listening.  A must-listen to.  A++. <br /> <br />12.)  I'm not going to lie.  \\"Sometimes it Snows in April\\" is the first Prince song I bawled on.  This happened about the first 10 times I listened to it (what? I'm a sensitive person...lol).  He makes it so real and the chorus is really deep. <br /> <br />~The whole album has me screaming \\"ENCORE!!!\\" Push the 'repeat' button on this entire album and listen carefully...there is something truly special about this album.  Again, a MUST-HAVE Prince album.  Can't be without it.  OWN & ENJOY!~ <br />
B0002Z0EYA|2.0|I am not one who objects to a little Hollywood license when translating a novel into a film. Omissions are inevitable. But this is a travesty.     First of all, it is a jumble. So much is left out that at times the story becomes incomprhensible. Important characters are omitted, and the roles of some characters are all too frequently assigned to different characters.     The story of Homer's Iliad begins after the seige of Troy has already been underway for nine years and ends with the funeral of Hector some months later. Much of what we know about the story and the characters is learned from other sources, such as the plays of Aeschylus and Vigil's Aeneid. There is nothing wrong with combining these sources to tell the tale of the Fall of Troy. But one would hope that the movie makers could keep the story straight. Sadly, they don't.    Omitted are such significant characters as Clytemnestra, Agamemnon's wife, Cassandra, the prophetess of Troy whose prediction that Paris will bring destruction upon the city proves to be all too accurate, Hecuba, King Priam's wife, and the Gods who play a vital role in the course of events.    Menelaus (pronounced MeneLAYus, not MeneLOUSE) is not killed by Hector. He lives to return to Sparta, bringing his wayward wife Helen with him.    Achilles is killed by a poisoned arrow shot by Paris BEFORE the fall of Troy. It is after the death of Achilles, when the Greeks are ready to give up and sail home, that Odysseus comes up with the Trojan Horse ruse.    It is never explained that Achilles is one of the ancient Greek heroes, the offspring of a godess (Thetis) and a man, or that his mother dipped him in the river Styx when he was an infant,  making him immortal. But she failed to immerse the heel by which she held him. Thus the significance of the arrow shot into his \\"Achilles heel,\\" the only spot on his body in which he could be killed    Paris is also killed BEFORE the fall of Troy and is not present at the end.    Agamemnon is not killed by Brises during the fall of Troy. He returns home to Mycenae where he is murdered by his wife Clytemnestra because he had sacrificed their daughter to the sea god Poseidon at the beginning of the Trojan War in order to obtain passage for his army across the Aegean Sea to Troy.    May the Gods punish those who are responsible for this butchery of the ancient tale of the Fall of Troy.
B00005JKC3|5.0|I don't understand why soo many people are giving this movie bad <br />reviews.  I did'nt see at the theater because people had some problem with the animation of the HULK character.  I watched with my friend on my home theater and was suprised.  Neither one of us knew what everyones problem was.  The movie was great. Sound was great. I thought the animation was great also. <br />I have learned not to listen too much to other peoples reviews, especially the long drawn out ones that are wannabes. This is another movie I will be adding to my collection.
B0000640SA|2.0|Guy Pearce and Joe Pantoliano star in this strange and  difficult movie to follow about a man who is hunting for his wife's killer.  Leonard Shelby (Pearce) is obsessed with finding the man who murdered his wife.  However, due to the trauma he suffered during the struggle to save his wife, he now suffers from short term memory loss.  Due to this condition, he's only able to remember names, events, and places for a very short time before he completely forgets them.  He has resorted to taking polaroids, writing notes, and even tattooing messages on his body. <br /> <br />Joe Pantoliano stars as Teddy, a person who befriends Leonard and tries to help him find the killer.  But is Teddy all that he seems to be? <br /> <br />I found this movie to be very hard to understand.  In reality, it was made backwards; with the ending shown first, and the film then works backwards to the start. It was hard to keep track of the plot, and I really had to \\"work\\" to watch the movie and keep track of the events.  Some parts of the movie were good, but when the conclusion came, I was left with just as many questions as I was at the beginning (or should I say end?). Thus, I only recommend this movie to people who have a sharp sense of detail, and who can follow events very closely.
B00003CXD5|5.0|\\"Treasure\\" is a treasure, one of those \\"great\\" movies you just have to sit down and watch if you love film. If you haven't yet seen it, you are missing a large part of your cinematic education. <br />It's not hard to watch...not in the least...but it's depiction of greed, ignorance and the disintegration of Bogart's character is \\"not fun\\" sometimes.  <br />Bogart is note-perfect, and all the more harrowing to watch for that reason. It's a \\"descent into madness\\" that defines that cliche. <br />The direction and screenplay, both Oscar winning efforts by John Huston, are examples of their craft. There's nary a dull moment, a wasted image or an unnecessary word. <br />Walter Huston, in his best role, deservedly won the Oscar for his role...he's more alive on screen here than pretty much any actor from the Golden Age. Every cackle, spitfire sentence or wary glance is precious. It's one of the great movie performances.  <br />Tim Holt, and in a smaller role, Bruce Bennett, are irreplaceable as well. As is said several times during the many documentaries, John Huston's masterful casting was the key to many of his successes, and never more so than here. <br />It's a lovely DVD...there are only a few reels where it looks like the restoration was a little \\"rushed\\". The \\"making-of\\" documentary is appropriately thorough and fascinating; the over-two-hour film on John Huston's life also adds depth to not only \\"Treasure\\" but to Huston's entire canon, and the history of film in the U.S. It's a remarkable document. <br />And don't miss the Bugs Bunny short \\"8 Ball Bunny\\"...definitely catch it after you watch the film (you'll need it). I guarantee a big smile will form across all who watch... <br /> <br />To sum up, I don't think the seduction of riches...of what happens after one finds the \\"mother lode\\"...has ever been more vividly portrayed. It's not a completely pleasurable ride...it's not meant to be...but it's immensely entertaining, provocative...you simply have to love filmmakers who are brave enough to tell a story that has such a strong opinion...a strong \\"point.\\" And one that forces you to see an essential part of what makes us human, yet a part we do not like to admit we have.
B000255LNE|5.0|I just now got this CD today and can say, it's a great collection. I wish a few more of his were on here, like \\"In too Deep\\" or \\"Doesn't Any one Stay together any more\\" were included but its a great set none the less. I endorse this CD
B00064MW6A|4.0|It has Halle Berry displaying a lot of Halle Berry. If you're a fourteen year old boy, or were one, that's probably enough. She doesn't display too much though - mothers of those boys need not worry.<br /><br />The action is strong and bloodless, the minor romantic themes are chaste, and Berry defeats the evil empress of the beauty products empire. (I did say this was a comic book, right?) Some of the \\"cat\\" scenes are laugh-out-loud funny, like falling off the shelf.<br /><br />The effects are generally good, and the CGI cats are surprisingly good. It's competent and well made, of its sort, but probably not one for the ages. Well, they don't all have to be. It's a great popcorn movie.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B000654YK6|4.0|This is a great documentary and a cool time capsule. My band had the good fortune of being in the right place at the right time and were included in this great flick so, obviously, I'm a little biased in my praise. A killer cast of characters, some great music and a super interesting glimpse into a wild time. Hype delivers! We all look so young, it's hard to believe it was over ten years ago that this all happened. My only complaint is that Rontrose looks exactly the same as he does now! What's up with that?!
B0002EXH54|4.0|\\"Peace Sells\\" is probably the first album that any metal fan thinks of when they think of Megadeth. This recording has inspired many people to dig deeper into metal, giving underrated bands like Testament a bigger fan base. What's not to like about this album? Both Mustaine and Poland are highly skilled guitarists. I don't like the way that Poland's guitar sounds on some of the tracks, but on ones such as \\"Wake Up Dead,\\" he sounds great. In fact, \\"Wake up Dead\\" and the title track are some of the best songs that Megadeth has ever made. \\"Devil's Island\\" is awesome too. While some songs seem like many little ideas pieced together (like \\"Wake Up Dead\\") it works very well. Dave's vocals are excellent here too, as they match the mood that the music is attempting to convey. While I think he could have chosen better lyrics for \\"Black Friday\\" (a graphic story about a serial killer), this album is a classic that belings in any metal fan's collection. <br /> <br />P.S. Although the remastering sounds great, people that already own the older version on CD need not buy this.
068987474X|4.0|I recently had been dumped by my boyfriend and was feeling pretty down then this book came out and I decided to buy it.  I couldn't believe that I was one of those women out there that was making those same excuses for my guy.  It really opened my eyes to the fact that I was just trying to make myself feel better even though he wasn't calling or just not interested.  I would recommend this book to any women who was feeling as though it was her fault that the guy was just not around.  I have to say I really learned alot from the book.
B00005JKOI|5.0|This movie is an all time classic, for those of us that grew up in the 80's. I will never get tired of this movie. It's a heart felt, romantic, comedy that will always be a \\"one of a kind\\". I love all the actors and their personalities. To say anything bad about this movie would be like saying that the 80's wasn't a time we'd all love to experience again. By all means, by this movie, you won't waist your time or money.
B00005JMAH|1.0|Before I go any further, you may want to know where this is coming from.  I am 15, Catholic, home-schooled, and look upon the use of contractions in formal writing as the first sign that a book is bad.  Rowling uses a lot of contractions. <br /> <br />I cannot compare the movie to the book, because I have never had the time necessary to waste on it - though it only took me 2 hrs to finish the first two. <br /> <br />The movie was just stupid - any lover of plot or logic will do well to keep away. <br /> <br />Item #1: under-age wizards are not alowed to use magic away from the school. <br />This is a sensible enough rule, but it seems as though a) it is never enforced; or b) an exception can be made for 'the one who lived' (or whatever he is called) <br /> <br />Item #2: Harry is disturbed that his god-father is after him, and holds him in contempt for being a murder. <br />Come on!! I mean, his life is always in danger because of Valdemort anyway, so lighten up!! As for not liking his god-father's being a murder, what about Harry's blowing-up his aunt?!? That's attempted murder!  <br /> <br />Item #3: Harry's god-father was one of his parents' best friends. <br />Witches and wizards obviously cannot believe in God. How can these atheistic/agnostic witches have god-parents?  Why would they even baptize their kids?  This brings up a similar point: why do they celebrate Christmas?  Wouldn't they more then likely celebrate Winter Solstice or the Feast of Thor or something? <br /> <br />Item #4: a wizard has to learn spells. <br />Wouldn't simple mathematics help with this process? How about chemistry? Algebra? If all these spells are in Latin anyway, shouldn't they have been taught the language? What about english/compostion? How can one expect these students to write 5-'scroll' essays if they cannot even formulate a cohessive paragraph? <br /> <br />Item #5: the time traveling. <br />Any good writer knows to keep away from it; such stuff can (and does) burn. My familyand I were waiting for the movie to end, when Harry and Hermione traveled back in time - and then they ended up replaying almost a third of the movie.  Please! The dialoge was almost too thriling the first time!! (Did you feel the sarcasim? because that's how I ment it.) <br /> <br />Item #6: Harry Potter is a good role model. <br />Listen, Parents: if you're wondering why your kids are being so disrespectful latly, maybe you should peek into one of the Potter books, or actually pay attention to the lessons being taught in the movies.  Harry Potter is selfish, mean, and a witch...excuse me, wizard. He lies, steals, looks up only to those teachers who believe he should get special attention, and (as I pointed out earlier) has attempted murder just because he was upset.  Harry: if you were just humble, patient, obedient and studious, then you might just be a more likable character! <br />Then again, the Culture of Death would probably reject you completly on the basis that you are not reallistically up to date.  <br /> <br />Item #7: Prof. Snape is hated by all Harry's friends because he is mean. <br />Excuse me? The guy saves Harry's life all the time, and they have the nerve to say that 'he just doesn't like' them?!?  The guy is broken up because he was jelous of Harry's dad (or loved Harry's mom, however you want to read into it); I have to admit that it's pitiful, but gains sympathies. Then Harry comes sturting in like a god (yes on both accounts: he can get away with practically anything at Hogwarts, and he does strut) and expects him to like it. That's another black mark on Harry's ever-growing record. <br /> <br />Besides the above, the rest are usual issues: bad effects, non-sensical plot, and poor acting(a lot of the acting was OK, just not up to par with some of the actors' records) <br /> <br />The only thing enjoyable about the film (I'll give it this presumtuous title only once) is the score and the cool credit sequence.  Here's a tip: if you want to seethis movie, and enjoy it, then switch off the half of your brain you use. <br /> <br />PS - I gave this one star only because 'negative 5' stars was not an available option.
089381525X|2.0|I love these photographs, and the quality of the reproduction is exquisite -- BUT  <br />most of the photos span two pages <br /> <br />Having a \\"spine crease\\" in the middle of the photos detracts severly from their beauty and impact
B00004SZWD|5.0|and this recording \\"Songs in the Key of Life\\" is a wonder, too, a musical artwork.  I loved it!  All songs were original classics, catchy tunes and meaningful lyrics.  Who could ask for more?  This is a necessary addition for the music lover's library. <br />
B00007G207|3.0|This review applies to \\"Cinema Paradiso - The New Version.\\"  There are two issues with this DVD.  The first is that the extended version of the original movie, which this DVD provides, includes almost an hour of additional footage and the resulting story is very different from the original.  There's plenty of debate among other reviewers about the net effect of these changes, but frankly, I think if you've already won an academy award for the first version you should leave it alone.<br /><br />The second issue is that the DVD has surprising technical shortcomings.  Unless you speak Italian you'll be watching it with subtitles.  And if you've got a widescreen TV half of the bottom line of each subtitle will be below the bottom of the screen.  You can reformat the display so that the subtitles are fully visible, but then the film is letterboxed.<br /><br />In addition, a number of the scenes seemed to be grainy and have very poor color intensity.  Considering that this DVD is billed as the \\"digitally remastered, fully restored\\" version, it's all the more disappointing.<br /><br />Overall, I'd recommend buying the original un-remastered, unrestored, unextended version instead.
6305428522|4.0|This is an utterly brilliant film, to be sure, worthy of every star or series of stars ever given in cinematic history. Its prelude, alone, is worthy of 5 stars, as are its performances, screenplay, cinematography, and striking use of the song \\"Mack the Knife\\" -- in two totally different performances. <br /> <br />So why do I only award it 4 stars? <br /> <br />A film of this caliber surely deserves more special features on its DVD release. (?) At the very least, Robert Redford should sit down and record his insights into this masterfully understated, superbly crafted, and exquistitely wrought drama. (?) Those who have seen the film are virtually begging for more, aren't we? <br /> <br />To be completely (and embarrasingly) honest, I only liked the film the first time I saw it, which was in the theatre when I was too young to appreciate its finer points. But I also believe its finer points defy the first viewing, as every subsequent showing of the film has uncovered a new dynamic, a new layer, a new penetrating insight. For one, I marvel at the bookending of the drama by totally different versions of \\"Mack the Knife\\" -- a song that we associate with the 50's by virtue of the famous Bobby Darrin and Louis Armstrong recorings, but that few know to have been written originally (and far more stringently) in the native German of Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Weill. The use of the song belies the filmmakers' knowledge of its incendiary message and content -- also the realization that the legendary Darrin recording superficially glosses over the bite of the original lyrics, via a TAME translation. (The story behind this is fascinating, but irrelevant.) Specifically, the opening credits are attended by the familiar, the period, the almost inane version recorded by Bobby Darrin -- but the final credits, with the ceaseless zooming in of the images of the audience, is accompanied by Lyle Lovett's far more knowing rendition: sinister, cynical and bitter.  <br /> <br />And dare I mention the engrossing but mysterious first scene? A scene that has (at a glance) virtually nothing whatsoever to do with the plot of the film? Mira Sorvino mentions in passing that Rob Morrow has been car-shopping at a point; that is the only reference (albeit oblique) to the opening scene in the main body of the film. And yet: its exquisite disection of the 1950's in America, and the hopes, fears, insecurities, and aspirations that attended it, is shocking. Watch as the camera carresses the rampant materialism and nearly seduces the car for us. Watch as the salesman (in this film about sales pitches) never loses a beat. Watch as the carpet is pulled out from under us: Sputnik flies over, the USSR beats us into space, the camera loses control. For the first time, it shows us the *entire* field of view, rather than a coquettish close-up. It loses focus on the objective: to sell. But Mr. slick salesman doesn't: he doesn't lose a beat in tying the calamity into his pitch. This is the kind of filmmaking that all of Hollywood should aspire to. And I defy any thinking, conscientious person to watch the entire movie and return to the opening scene without seeing it as a kind of overture to the film, reducing its themes and intentions into a brief and enticing summary. <br /> <br />And again, I wonder: why doesn't a dumbfounding masterpiece like this not merit more in the way of commentary? <br /> <br />The film itself gets at least 5 stars; the by-the-numbers DVD presentation, 3-ish.
1400032717|5.0|I'll admit, I did not read any reviews or hear anything about this book prior to reading it.  In fact, I bought it not knowing that it was on the best-seller list and that Mark Haddon had received such wonderful reviews.  In other words, I was clueless about what this book was about or how well it was written.  I picked it up on a whim, on vacation, and was pleasantly surprised to stumble on such a richly composed, witty and poignant work. <br />  I have no first-hand knowledge of autism but while reading this book I glimpsed the daily - no, minute-by-minute - struggle that those afflicted with this condition endure.  Haddon puts this child in a working-class family, evidently without any prior emotional tools with which to deal with the issues autism brings, and their family deals with it the very best they can.  I do not know if Haddon is autistic or not, or if he has someone like that within his sphere of loved-ones.  But whether he does or not, he writes with remarkable ability and accomplishes the hardest task a writer can have; that of getting the reader to actually believe that the character is not fictional, but real.  GREAT BOOK, and a welcome diversion from the ordinary Best seller!
B000003S0P|5.0|Don't get me wrong...I like John Wetton alot but when someone starts to mention Wetton and Squire in the same sentence I've got to puke. Anyone with any talent at all could play bass as well as Wetton in about a month. Wetton didn't even know how to play bass when Fripp added him to Crimson and in fact Fripp had to teach him how to play the damn thing. <br />
B0006A9FMI|4.0|First, the artwork is GREAT. 3D, 2D, all done with great skill. Lots of money was tossed at the film.<br /><br />Subtitled - of course. Somestimes, like when Section 9 is having a meeting, the subtitles can go damn fast. The really bad part is a lot of the subtitles are not needed - I can hear the gun shots guys. It has no English track, sorry, but many of us don't worry about that.<br /><br />Lots of gun battles, female robots and gritty dark streets. Is it EVER day?<br /><br />Good soundtrack, but not great. Lot of it seems to be plucked right out of the first movie.  Hehe. Plucked, get it?<br /><br />The plot was taken from one of the many sub-plots from The Ghost In The Shell manga (Vol One) but characters have been changed, details have been added, parts twisted and expanded on so much that you don't know it till the last ten minutes or so WHICH stand alone story was used.<br /><br />That way you don't feel cheated with an old plot and yet the story fits the setting because it, like the background, was from the same source. It doesn't feel forced.<br /><br />The Major does pop up a couple of times and the hound, just to let you have one spoiler, is in no danger. The hound is never in any danger - no body points a gun at him and he is never threatened in any way. His health may be in question, but he never dies on the big screen. Just like the dogs in _The Day After Tomorrow_ and _ID4_ he is the one person you KNOW will make it. Like that cat from Alien. Just to calm all you animal lovers.<br /><br />Don't worry - they kill off a bunch of humans, cyborgs and \\"other\\", mostly people who are no good and really should die. For the plot, anyway.<br /><br />I WOULD of given it five stars with cleaner subtitles and a English sound track, but what can you do?
0553802534|4.0|Lisa Gardner's new novel of suspense, \\"Alone,\\" is, to a major extent, about people who have survived terrible childhood traumas that have left them emotionally scarred.  One of these people is Catherine Gagnon.  As a child, she was abducted, molested, and kept in an underground cage for twenty-eight days.  Miraculously, Catherine was rescued and her attacker went to jail.  However, from that time on, she has never felt fully human.  Catherine's male counterpart is Massachusetts State Trooper Bobby Dodge.  Bobby's father was a violent drunk who drove his wife away, and Bobby has been carrying around a feeling of deep-seated rage towards his father and his absent mother for years.<br /><br />The lives of Catherine and Bobby converge when James Gagnon, Catherine's husband, is reported to the police for allegedly wielding a gun and threatening his wife and four-year-old son, Nathan.  Bobby, who is an expert sniper, is summoned to the scene, and he soon has the Gagnon family in his sights.  Should Bobby pull the trigger to save the wife and child or wait for instructions from his superiors?  Bobby's fateful decision will change his life forever.<br /><br />Lisa Gardner has a major following because she knows how to construct a compelling and fast-moving story.  We are drawn to Bobby's plight.  He is a decent and hard-working man who cannot sustain a long-term relationship with a woman, since he has never fully come to terms with the loss of his mother.  Catherine is a cipher.  Is she an innocent victim of a brutal husband or is she a manipulative schemer with a secret agenda of her own?  Adding to the mystery is Nathan Gagnon's poor health. Catherine's son has never gained weight and grown as a normal boy should, yet the doctors can find nothing specifically wrong with the child.<br /><br />So far so good.  Unfortunately, Gardner steers her book in the wrong direction when she overcomplicates her plot.  She throws in everything but the kitchen sink, and I'm sure if I look hard enough, I'll find the sink.  The man who molested Catherine, Richard Umbrio, is suddenly and mysteriously released from prison.  Who engineered his parole and what is Umbrio up to?  Probably nothing good.  Meanwhile, Catherine's in-laws, Judge James and Maryanne Gagnon, hate Catherine and they are desperate to destroy their daughter-in-law's life.  Why are they so cruel to her?<br /><br />As bodies start piling up and as Bobby's and Catherine's lives deteriorate further, \\"Alone\\" crosses the line from taut thriller to unrealistic melodrama. Too bad.  Gardner knows how to build tension and I was looking forward to the exciting conclusion of the story.  I enjoyed the well-written scenes between Bobby and his psychiatrist, Dr. Lane, in which he is forced to confront his demons for the first time.  There are also several action sequences that are genuinely scary.  However, Gardner's writing falters as the book reaches its far-out conclusion. Although \\"Alone\\" had the potential to be a first-rate novel, it doesn't quite make the grade.d the sink.

044024157X|1.0|I have read every John Grisham novel and found this to be very very boring. <br /> <br />The best way to read this book: <br /> <br />1.  Read the first twenty pages <br />2.  Read about twenty pages in the middle <br />3.  Read the last twenty pages <br /> <br />All the other material is just fluff and a real waste of time.
B00005JMYI|2.0|I have to agree with many reviewers on this movie in that it wasn't that entertaining to watch. I think that's pretty sad when you watch and see good actors like Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller and Tim Robbins are in this movie (although they didn't have any big role). Ferrell is the San Diego anchorman Ron Burgundy who is the number one anchorman in the city and lives up to the superstar fame. Watching him was almost like watching al bundy from married with children as he appeared to be nothing more than a bum. It seemed like all Ron could do really well is read off what he saw on the screen and try to make it sound interesting. The whole news cast was very cocky and arrogant as they felt that noone could stop them. There was one hilarous scene that involved four other local news team meeting up in an alley and trying to patch up their difference in bloody war which ends up killing a few people and cutting off some body parts which was pretty much the only real funny scene in the movie. Of course, things change when  <br />Veronica Corningstone (Christina Applegate) arrives and is looking to be an anchorman herself. Of course, she would have her work cut out for her as a newsroom of predominate males felt that it wasn't designed for a woman. Even though she probably thought it was wrong, she falls head over heels over Ron when they hook up at a nightclub and shows off his other talent by playing the flute. Things would eventually change when Ron showed up late for work and Veronica filled in for him. Ron is furious and shows his male ego which irriates Veronica and ends the relationship. However, Veronica decided to not stop there and she publicly humilated Ron and caused him to get fired when she changed up some of the words on the screen. Without a job and the whole city ticked off at him for his words on the air, Ron hit deep depression. Now the news channel is concerned as now all the other local stations can now have a shot at competiting with them. However, Veronica does go the extra mile to try and bring Ron back. Ron must convince his staff who no longer worked for the news channel. Eventually, the group does get back together in time to cover a huge story at the zoo which the other four local news teams were trying to get the big scope on. Ron ends up saving Veronica from become the lunch of a tiger and saved the news team. The two ended up renewing their relationship and were co-anchors. You should rent it before you decide to buy it.  <br />
B00005OAA6|5.0|I thought a former Spice Girl's solo work would be less than amateur...I was wrong! This cd has tons of US potential and sends a chill up your spine when you hear the dance tracks. Her debut single \\"Out Of Your Mind\\" debuted at #2 in the UK and her other singles all broke the top 5! This album debuted at #10 in the UK and I can see why. This is far from 'Spice', it has RnB influences with dance background, and a ton of attitude! This is truely one of the best albums I have ever heard and I can't wait to get it for myself! 10/5 stars!!!
B0006A9FMI|1.0|As many other have pointed out, the subtitles on this DVD is utterly annoying and makes the whole movie unwatcheable. For some reason the English subtitles are for hearing impaired and every noise of explosion is followed by a fat (with ugly font) [Noise]/[Explosion]. Me and my wife were not able to watch beyond the first five minutes. Wait for a better transfer!
B00064MW6K|3.0|i only have a few things to say about this movie, good and bad... <br />*the music is awesome <br />*halle did a great job <br />*the digital work looks really fake <br />*the real catwoman isnt nice like in this movie <br /> <br />but all around the movie is OK ....
B00007KQG5|5.0|Oooooh! This is one great video! It's hot, it's spicy, and it's seriously well made and well written, which gives you a great excuse to watch it--you can say you're watching it for its artistic merit, instead of just admitting that you bought it to perve on Sean Bean's (Lord of the Rings) gorgeous bottom! (Or Joely Richardson's bits, if you'd rather.) <br /> <br />The cast is lovely, the script intelligent, the scenery opulent, and the plot intriguing. Need I say more? Watch it, preferably with your significant other. You won't be disappointed.
B00023BLXK|4.0|This movie was actually quite good. When I first found out that they were doing a second Dirty Dancing my first instinct was NO! Absolutely NOT! So many times when film makers toy with older movies they never seem to come out right. For example Disney and the many sequels they torture us with. However, when I sat down and watched the movie I LOVED it! It got me really excited about dancing just as the first version had. I actually went to see the movie twice when it was in theaters. Something I had never really done before. The only reason I give it four stars is because I'm not that happy with the girl they chose to play Katie who was the Protagonist in the movie. Most of the time she was fine but sometimes I felt that she could have done a better job with some of her lines. Also there was the matter of the way Katie and her dance partner Javier express their feelings to each other. There really isn't a reckoning point. There are several points in the movie where I thought, \\"Ok this is it. They're going to kiss each other and realize each others affections.\\" But it never really came that way. The first time we see them kiss is on the dance floor as the result of Javier's spontaneity. Then suddenly the next night they sleep with each other. It happens in a lot the same way in the first movie. If they were attempting to be more true to reality they missed the mark because I don't know if that is really something that would happen. A shy straight laced innocent virgin like Katie just hopping into his arms for one night. Then again, maybe that's the power of love...
B000002H97|5.0|This album is, in my opinion, Metallica's best work. Rather than making another trash album, Metallica decided to make something different for a change. They get put down for this alot. All of their albums don't have to be same people! <br /> <br />Another thrash album would of been great too, but their last album (\\"...And Justice for All\\") was just another attempt to make another \\"Ride the Lightning\\" (RTL). RTL was their second album, and a great album indeed. Their two albums after that, \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"...And Justice for All\\", were good but looked like pure attempts to make another RTL. The songs were even arranged in the same format: intro, title-track, fill-in, soft song, a few more thrashers, then an instrumental. It was about time they broke the cycle. Since all of Metallica's albums after this one were really pathetic, alot of fans like to put the blame on this one. It's just not fair. <br /> <br />Metallica took their natural direction and as a result made a great album. The two metal-head geniuses were absent from the band. Dave Mustaine was dismissed from the band before \\"Kill Em' All\\" debuted, and Cliff Burton was killed in a bus accident after \\"Master of Puppets\\". These two guys were what kept Metallica's trash days great. Once they were both gone the band was still able to produce some decent thrash, but nothing magnificant like before. However, the new arrangement of the band after Burton's death was what lead to this album. The \\"new\\" Metallica (at that point) was a perfect line-up for creating this classic album. The result was great rock mixed with a hint of metal. Talented solos and memorable riffs complete the album. It struck a perfect balance. It was easy for the masses to stomach, but still satisfied alot of the metal-heads out there. The music at the time was really legendary. <br /> <br />This album starts off with some great openers. \\"Enter Sandman\\" and \\"Sad But True\\" are two of Metallica's best. They have memorable riffs and choruses. \\"The Unforgiven\\" is an all-time classic. It's only a song that Metallica could make, and they did it well. \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" is another. Although this gets a little repetitive, it's still great. \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" is a yet another. Alot of metalheads put this one down because it's a soft song. What they don't realize is that it's a great soft song. We would all be missing out if Metallica didn't make this song! \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" has a justice theme to it with great melodies. I love it! Then there are a few good rockers. Of course, there are a few songs that I don't particularly care for on this album, but what album doesn't? <br /> <br />I like Metallica, but alot of their albums do get old. I was a great fan of their earlier thrash albums, but I rarely listen to them anymore. \\"Master of Puppets\\" and \\"...And Justice for All\\" just had songs that were too long and got boring after awhile. This one still remains a classic. Instead of \\"look, we are cool because we can strum really fast and play really fast solos\\" type of songs, they focused on making, well, just good songs. I'm not saying their earlier songs were bad. I respect them for being the metal leaders at the time, but there is a difference between a good metal song and one that just fades away over time because it's all about fast-paced strumming and solos. On the part of good oldschool thrash metal, I would suggest \\"Kill 'Em All\\". There are alot of classic songs on that album that I still love. <br /> <br />Overall, this album has a great unique feel to it that you can't find in any of their other albums. This album also includes some of Metallica's best and most memorable. Not only is this a great Metallica album, but it's one of the best rock albums ever! It's almost impossible to not have already heard some of the songs off of this album, being as this is the one that really launched Metallica into the mainstream. Nevertheless, the music remains great. Whether you're a Metallica fan or not, Ihighly recommend this. Pick it up when you can!
B00000634J|4.0|I'm fascinated by the number of reviews listed here for an album that is, after all, only a compilation of songs that have all appeared on various albums/packages before.  But it seems that Lennon is one of those rare artists who gets evaluated not only for his music but also for his message; for who he was as a man, as well as for his songs.   <br /> <br />My philosophy on this is that songs need to be judged as songs--for their overall quality as compositions, the quality of the recording, the quality of the playing, whether the artist was successful at communicating the intent of the song, etc.  Of course, Lennon as an artist tends to write on themes very close to him personally and was often autobiographical--thus it's hard to completely separate the music from the man.  However, in my comments I will try to do so. <br /> <br />First, as an introduction to Lennon's solo work, this collection seems a decent representation of his material; like some other reviewers here, I would like to see certain songs from the Lennon canon included in place of others.   <br /> <br />For example, I would have included both \\"Hold On\\" and \\"Look at Me\\" from the Plastic Ono Band Album (two great, short Beatlesque tunes).  \\"Real Love\\" is Lennon at his best- melodic, honest & idealistic- and should also be here.  I think \\"Intuition\\" (from Mind Games) is an interesting, light-hearted but overlooked Lennon song.  \\"Gimme Some Truth\\" from Imagine is also a cool song.   Both of these could also have been included. <br /> <br />Many songs that are here-- Mother, Instant Karma, Power to the People, Give Peace a Chance-- are part of the Lennon \\"legend\\", yet don't bear repeated listenings.  \\"Nobody Told Me\\" and \\"Borrowed Time\\", from the posthumously released Milk and Honey, are OK but not his best work.  Perhaps my choices for inclusion are subjective, but I think some of Lennon's best work is not represented by these more well known songs. <br /> <br />As a big Beatles fan, it is always interesting to note the way in which the solo careers of the Beatles diverged; it gives insight into what their individual strengths as artists were.  In Lennon's case, there was certainly a gift for melody and the way that he tries to make his songs both personal and meaningful.  McCartney's post-Beatle work has demonstrated his extraordinary musicality, gift for arrangement and prolific tunefulness--yet highlights his lighter nature as a lyricist.  Their strengths in these areas were truly complementary-- McCartney's perfectionistic craftsmanship balanced by Lennon's more spontaneous approach to writing and recording; Lennon's desire to say something meaningful counteracting McCartney's tendency towards superficiality.  McCartney is the more consummate musician, but Lennon had the heart of a true artist. Would that they could have teamed up once again... <br /> <br />Finally I would like to comment on Lennon, the man, in a kind of rebuttal to those who have posted very negative evaluations of him here.  As a Christian, I certainly don't agree with much of Lennon's philosophy, as reflected both in his work and his interviews.  Nevertheless, I recognize his talent as an artist and communicator to be real and powerful.  Certainly his gift for  melody and songwriting communicated his message in ways much more powerful and lasting that much of popular music today.  So I can find him talented without necessarily endorsing his total message or lifestyle choices.  Also, I'm not sure whether it's fair to judge him so harshly on the possible divorce between the utopian vision of his music and his personal life.  As a songwriter myself, I would say that in songs we try to be our ideal selves, and to portray the world as it should be.  Hopefully, we can do this without being complete hypocrites, but who among us is not a hypocrite to some degree? <br /> <br />I applaud Lennon for at least wanting to make the world a better place and making his music about that.  Lennon sang \\"GimmeSome Truth\\"-- I only wish he had truly found the Truth that is Jesus Christ, rather than missing Christ's message in the sins of organized religion.

031286504X|4.0|I am legend is great, propably the second best vampire novel since Dracula. I just want to mention the other (short/er) stories in this anthology. Alot of reviewers only talk about \\"I am Legend\\". I can understand that; since it is the title story and the longest story of this anthology. But, in my opinion, the story \\"Dance of the Dead\\" is far greater. It alone is worth the price of this anthology. It has the dystopian atmosphere of \\"A clockwork orange\\" and the nightmarish visual themes of the great J.G.Ballard. Only a master writer can get that mix within 17 pages (and before Anthony Burgess and J.G.Ballard).

B00000IN5G|5.0|i really enjoy this album, which is strange considering i am normally not a huge fan of screaming vocals. i believe i enjoy this because the guitars remain thrashy and upbeat. bands such as lamb of god i am not particularly fond of because the songs are really slow-tempo and the vocals are deep and raspy. however, children of bodom are more high pitched and are very melodic, making them more appealing. this album is full of solos and complex riffs, something VERY scarce in most of todays rock/metal. the keyboards blend very well with the guitar riffs, and the driving drum beats may remind some of a dave lombardo-era slayer. this album has fewer 80s-style keyboard lines than follow the reaper, but not to say reaper is by any means a bad album. the lyrics are dark, though you wouldnt know it because first you can barely understand them anyway, but the songs remain upbeat and fun. occasionaly vocalist Alexi will switch to a deeper voice which will make the album seem toned down a bit, but it quickly picks up- such as on the song children of bodom. definately pick this up if your an old metal fan, esp if you like slayer. if you prefer classic metal such as sabbath or maiden, you still might enjoy this if you can ignore the vocals and enjoy the musicianship, which easily overshadows the vocals. great album- best metal band to come along since Guns N' Roses, hands down.
B00004WEJZ|4.0|This film was the perfect farewell to Sean Connery -The best Bond ever- . After more than a decade with Roger Moore, it was decided to make a funny remake of Thunderball with lots of finest humor and obviously double sense jokes.<br /><br />The presence of a splendid cast : Max von Sydow and the third best villain of Bond series, Klaus Maria Bandauer and the glorious beauty of the talented and promising by then actress Kim Bassinger  who besides became the maxim sex symbol of the eighties-  the first Bond girl who eventually would receive an Academy Award, years before Halle Berry repeated the same feat, makes of this work a sympathetic evasion film who will remind Connery with an excess of free radicals and toxins.<br /><br />Watch for the male villain: the dazzling and exuberant Barbara Carrera.<br /><br />An unusual film a bit overlong perhaps, working out more as a tribute to Connery instead just another additional Bond entry.  I presume Kershner was the chosen director after having worked in Connery's first comedy in the late sixties: A fine madness.
B000062YB1|3.0|i dont know why but for a while i disliked this album. ive given it another chance, and i really like it. its a lot more melodic than reign in blood and each band member shines. dave lombardo displays some excellent drumming here while Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman slow their riffs down a bit but still can play like hell. great pickup if your a fan of slayer or darker metal
0060930187|5.0|\\"The Bell Jar\\" by Silvia Plath, is a book about a girl named Esther Greenwood. She begins to go crazy after she returns home to Boston, from her summer job in New York. She finds that unreality is taking over her life. She makes several suicide attempts and is taken to a mental hospital to be treated. <br />    I would highly reccommend \\"The Bell Jar\\". The author writes in an excellent style that makes Esther Greenwood's insanity seem so real. This is a tragic but wonderful and interesting book of how Esther lives her life with her insanity. She undergoes shock treatments at a mental hospital, but along the way, she meets new people and recalls back on some past experiences. I can guarantee that anyone who reads this book will love it just as I did, and will not be dissappointed.
B000002UA0|5.0|I gotta say I really hate Pink Floyd, but also admit that this is one of the best albums ever made. To be fair right after Umma Gumma they should have changed the band name, because what came after is just a bunch of crap. This album has so much imagination, and vision it transcends the common listening experience. All I can say is that you should buy this, and then seek out the other Pink Floyd singles (Relics, Emily Play, Arnold Layne), and then hunt down the rarities (Scream Thy Last Scream, King Bee, Vegetable Man). Once you've completed that mission get Madcap Laughs and Opel. Once you do that you'll have some music to fall back on for years.
B000001FV3|3.0|There is another version of this disc floating around out there, a ten track replica of the original vinyl release.  I suppose the version I have is a 1980's release, since the version you've clicked on here is from 1990, and includes some interesting bonus tracks, which I'm missing. I'll be mentioning those bonus tracks here, but I won't be incorporating them into my review, or taking into account in my rating. <br /> <br />'Traffic' was formed when Steve Winwood decided to exit 'The Spencer Davis Group'.  He took along with him Dave Mason, who had earned some recording credits by adding to the din of percussion instruments on Spencer Davis classics such as 'I'm a Man' and 'Gimme Some Lovin'.  'Mr. Fantasy' was the band's debut album, released in December of 1967.  The band however had been front-and-center since their May of 1967 release of 'Paper Sun', which didn't crack the Top 40 in the states, but topped out at number 5 on the UK charts.  Oddly enough that tune, along with two other Top 10 UK hits for the band, 'Hole In My Shoe' (#2) and 'Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush' (#8) were not included on the original vinyl release.  'No Face No Name No Number', which does appear on the vinyl version, hit number 40 on the UK charts in March of 1968. <br /> <br />It's easy to see why Island Records found it appropriate to include these UK single releases on reissues of 'Mr. Fantasy'.  The album has not aged well, with it's psychedelic underpinnings, unlike those of The Beatles 'Sgt. Peppers', now sounding superficial and cheesy.  This is particularly true of the Dave Mason tracks, 'House For Everyone', 'Utterly Simple', and 'Hope I Never Find Me There'.  These songs are devoid of meaningful melody and lyrical message, relying on sound effects and sitar meanderings that come off as stereotypes of psychedelia.  It's really a wonder that Winwood would allow inclusion of these tracks rather than filling out the disc with some of their single successes.  Luckily, Mason'smimicing of others would give way in the later part of the decade to some of the finest rock composing of the era, but he certainly had a long way to go, and some baggage to dump along the way.  Unfortunately, 'Mr. Fantasy' was his first landfill. <br /> <br />The compositions by Winwood, percussionist Jim Capaldi, and jack-of-all-trades Chris Wood fare better.  'Heaven Is In Your Mind' (also released as a single in 1968), a song better known to many by the 'Three Dog Night' cover, along with the title track, are classic psychedelia.  'Coloured Rain' and 'Giving To You' are also worthwhile compositions, especially notable for Mason's extraordinary guitar work and Winwood's instantly recognizable organ stylings.  'No Face No Name No Number' is the only love ballad, this one of the unrequited variety.  'Berkshire Poppies' is a miss however, for the same reasons Mason's fare failed, and 'Dealer', the only composition entirely Capaldi's, is an odd mix of Spanish calypso sounds merged with an anti-drug dealer message.  Steppenwolf's 'The Pusher' does a much better job of getting the mood right.  <br /> <br />'Mr. Fantasy' is the left-hand bookend to two \\"fantasy\\" albums that serve as touchstones for Traffic's most productive years.  'Shoot Out At the Fantasy Factory', the right-hand bookend, was released in 1973 as the sequel to the band's tour-de-force, 'The Low Spark of High Heeled Boys'.  Ironically, these two \\"fantasy albums\\" are probably the band's weakest studio efforts, but time has proven that anything by Steve Winwood and Dave Mason will have quality written all over it.  The sound of this disc and the liner notes could be poster boys for what many people imagine the psychedelic era was all about, so if you enjoy that musical niche... go for it!
B00064MW6A|2.0|There is universal agreement that Halle Berry is a beautiful woman, and after winning the Academy Award for \\"Monster's Ball,\\" she has the bona fides of a legitimate actress.  Hiring Berry to play \\"Catwoman\\" makes sense, because there is a tradition of the character being sexy and smart going all the way back to the campy \\"Batman\\" television series where Julie Newmarr and Eartha Kitt essayed the role of the felonious feline.  But when it becomes clear in this 2004 film that the primary emphasis of Halle Berry as Catwoman is on her breasts, then I think it is clear this movie has lost definitely its focus on what makes Catwoman work.<br /><br />Catwoman first appeared in the final story in \\"Batman\\" #1, when she was simply the Cat (a.k.a. Selina Kyle), the world's greatest cat burglar.  She was devoid of superpowers, although she certainly employs her many cat-like qualities to her advantage.  She walks the line between being good and bad, which explains why she is so attractive to Batman, since the Dark Knight's vigilantism has him walking that thin line as well.  But in this story/screenplay by Theresa Rebeck, John Brancato & Michael Ferris, and John Rogers neither Selina Kyle nor the Batman make an appearance.  For fans this becomes the obvious place to point a finger and start wagging it disparagingly.<br /><br />In this incarnation Berry plays Patience Phillips, a talented commercial artist who designs print advertisements without a shread of self-confidence at H&H, a cosmetics company run by the husband and wife team of George (Lambert Wilson) and Laurel Hedare (Sharon Stone).  Laurel has been the face of the company since its inception, but now she is being replaced by a younger face, and she is not at all happy about this changing state of affairs (you have to think this plot is hitting really close to home for Stone).  There are some rather serious problems with the cosmetics H&H is putting out, and when Patience stumbles across something she should not see in some place she should not have been, she is killed.<br /><br />When Patience is murdered she comes back to life after Midnight, a cat whose lineage goes back to the cat gods of ancient Egypt, breathes the power of Catwoman into her.  But even though there is Ophelia Powers (Frances Conroy), a character who exists to provide Patience with the necessary background information, there is no real point beyond the exposition.  Usually when someone is granted superpowers like this, from another being, there is a mission statement.  Instead, what we get is a checklist of cat powers as more of an instructor's manual.  Since Patience was murdered, Catwoman has a reason to do something about that, although it does not seem too much of a pressing concern to her.  But there was an entire history lesson shown behind the opening credits and you would think it would actually lead to something significant in the film itself.<br /><br />When this Catwoman steals some jewels, it seems just a nod to the comic book character, and not a serious bit of motivation.  Instead of a bad girl who sometimes does good things, what we have is a woman dealing with a split personality.  At this point I was reminded that the idea for a \\"Catwoman\\" movie was first floated after Michelle Pfeiffer's turn in \\"Batman Returns,\\" which would explain the character's personality disorder.  But while this makes sense when Catwoman/Selina Kyle is faced with Batman/Bruce Wayne, it has no resonance with the lead character is dealing with a cop, Tom Lone (Benjamin Bratt).  He sees the world in black and white terms, while Catwoman works best as a gray character.  But in this film she is bouncing back and forth between Patience and Catwoman without any rhyme or reason that resonates with the audience.<br /><br />Catwoman's final costume, the infamous dominatrix outfit, is wrong for the character and actually extremely unflattering to Berry.  Why anybody would want to make a movie with Halle Berry and make her look bad is beyond me, but this film manages to do it.  I also think the character worked better with the long hair along with the full-body suit, which did not have to be made of leather.  Then, to cap off the string of disappointments, we have the climatic cat fight between Catwoman and Laurel, whose use of cosmetics has had an interesting side-effect that could have been taken advantage of in the big fight but was not (because that would have made sense).  Still, given that the film is devoid of thrilling stunts or memorable one liners, it is not surprising that it is a complete failure across the board.<br /><br />Of the DVD extras the best of the bunch is the retrospective on the character of Catwoman, narrated by Eartha Kitt, who does the best purr in the history of the world.  Watching the documentary it becomes clear that all of the actresses who have played Catwoman have had both a better respect for and a better understanding of the character than those who put together this film.  The irony that \\"Catwoman,\\" one of the worst comic book movies of all time, came out the same summer as one of the very best, \\"Spider-Man 2,\\" is not lost on those of us weaned on comic book superheroes.  Hopefully the people who are doing the next Batman movie will have figured out which of those two to hold up as a role model.ke her look bad is beyond me, but this film manages to do it.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|Let me summarize this album for you... The band was falling apart. Roger Waters was still mourning the childhood he lost when his father was killed in WW2, 40 years before. The band, especially Waters, was not happy with the movie version of \\"The Wall,\\" hence the picture on the back cover of the soldier holding a film reel with a knife stuck in his back. And to top things, England was at war with Argentina in the Falklands. All of these factors played into the brilliance of this work. The songs are pointed and often bitter. Some of them pack enough emotional punch to leave the listener breathless, even today where they are as relevant as ever. The Gunner's Dream just may be the best military funeral song out there. The addition of \\"When The Tigers Broke Free\\" to the flow of the original album enhances the musical statement and the remastering is significantly better than the Columbia remaster from 1996. The Final Cut is one sharp emotional instrument. Handle it with care and cherish that you live in an age where music of this caliber was made.
B00005JLD4|4.0|I saw this movie twice, what a gripping story...I couldn't help but feel anxiety watching this movie of these three girls on their journey back home. I was glued to this movie.

B0002858YS|5.0|Okay, I admit I was skeptical about The Killers. I had only heard 'Somebody Told Me' on the radio a few times, and while the song was amusing, I wasn't exactly impressed out of my socks or anything. So I borrowed the CD from my library system and gave it a listen. <br /> <br />Wow. <br /> <br />That's my first reaction. The songs are just amazing. The lyrics are beautiful, the music itself is gorgeous, and while Brandon's voice is a little different, it too is marvelous. It's not really like anything else out on the market today. It's fresh, it's catchy, and it's amazingly good. <br /> <br />The caught a lot of popularity after appearing on Fox's teen drama 'The O.C.', and are currently up for a number of Grammy's for their amazing first album Hot Fuss. It's a great mix of indie rock and emo that you'll just want more and more of. <br /> <br />Get this CD as soon as humanly possible, you will NOT regret it.

0385510454|2.0|The powers of the president.  In the final dying days of his term, the President of the United States isn't averse to accepting a little bribe or a little persuasion to pardon hot ticket criminals from serving out the remainder of their terms.  Especially when it comes with the endorsement of the C.I.A.  Once a force to be reckoned with, ex Washington powerbroker Joel Backman no longer has any clout to bargain for his own release, so it's more than just a pleasant surprise when he is bundled up and transported hush hush to Italy, with the demand that he learn to be a native, and fast. <br />  <br />What brought down the fall of a great man was greed.  Shopping a powerful computer program to various dueling countries had promised to be the coup of Backman's glittering career - instead that spotlight brought him down.   Anyone with money wanted that program.  It would give the buyer sole control of a newly discovered system of spy satellites and limitless scope to keep an eye on just about everyone.  Backman's release isn't an act of kindness from the U.S. Government, it's a tactical move.  If they watch who goes after him, maybe they'll find out just who those mystery buyers might have been.  Also, who put those satellites up there in the first place, as Backman was never one for the telling. <br />  <br />There's not much thrilling about this thriller.  In large parts, \\"The Broker\\" seems only to be the author fondly recalling a memorable Italian holiday.    While the obligatory man on the run chase scenes are included, they make up the whole of the only exciting passages in this novel.  What could have been explored more thoroughly, such as the political maneuvers of the C.I.A. or the global bad guys battling for control is barely touched upon.  \\"The Broker\\" is a harmless, sometimes meandering read, one that may please Grisham fans who prefer the non-legal thrillers, and like the gentler literary avenues that Grisham has late been known to explore. <br />
B00005JNEW|5.0|I know this movie will simply go in the collection of the many football movies that are out there such as Remember the Titans and Varsity Blues, but this is a great movie and very much worth buying. <br />Since this movie is based on a true story, I like how the whole film had a documentary look to it.  Billy Bob Thorton plays the football coach, and he does an excellent job.  He is such a great actor, and I was very pleased to see that he was not wasting his talent in such disasters as Bad Santa. <br />Tim McGraw surprised me a great deal with his talent as a actor.  He plays an alcoholic father of one of the football players, and it was nice to see he shed that \\"hey, look at me! I'm a sexy country singer\\" side of him. <br />Another thing that was refreshing about this particular film was that the actors who made up the football team were not well known.  That's the last thing we need..Colin Farrell or Orlando Bloom pretending to be football players.  Not having a long list of well known actors helps the audience focus on the film rather than how (insert actor's name here)'s butt look in a pair of football pants. <br />If you're not into sports movie, at least rent it.  And if you are then I highly recommend buying it.
0440237688|3.0|I realy liked the beginning of this book. As it goes on, however, it begins to get slightly repetative and than has one of the worst endings I have ever read.I recomend this book if you don't have anything else to read,all in all it was OK.
B00005NTN5|5.0|Before the Wachowski Brothers (errr..Siblings?) hit it big with \\"The Matrix Trilogy,\\" they made a more modest, but just as exciting film called \\"Bound.\\" \\"Bound\\" is a lot of things, filled to the brim with comedy, sex, action and suspense. The film works, to a lesser extent, in the way that \\"Pulp Fiction\\" did, with surreal violence and quirky characters. It's got a great cast, but the movie is really centered upon the brilliant trio of Jennifer Tilly, Gina Gershon and Joe Pantoliano, who all turn in great performances and give a lot to their characters. Tilly plays Violet, the wife of Caesar, an awkward mobster, played to a \\"T\\" by Pantoliano. When Violet gets bored of being a prize wife to Caesar, she finds herself falling for an ex-con who is painting the apartment next-door. As things turn out, this ex-con is a woman, a bona-fide lesbian by the name of Corky, played by Gershon. Corky falls for Violet as well, and the two begin a forbidden romance, which in turns makes for some rather sexy scenes between Tilly and Gershon -- yes, there is even a bit of nudity. The two eventually stage a runaway and robbery of Caesar and the two million-something dollars he is babysitting. The plot gets more complicated from here on out, as each step the characters make seems to get them into deeper trouble, and the stakes are constantly being raised. This is one of those movies where you never look at the time, you are just so engrossed by what is going on in front of you. The only disappointment here is that the ending works out just a little too easy, sort of like the Wachowski's cheated. But even still, it's a top rate thriller. While the first third of the movie is centered around lesbian lust (and is probably worth the DVD price alone), the rest of the movie is much more serious but just as entertaining. It was also pretty cool to see the Wachowski's test some of the shots and methods they used (and in turn, got famous for) in \\"The Matrix.\\" This movie definitely has their mark on it, and if you are a fan, it's just another good reason to check this flick out. The DVD has some decent features, mainly a commentary track from the usually silent Wachowski's and a few castmembers, with a trailer to go along with it. All in all, a really well-done and thoroughly entertaining movie. The scenes between Gershon and Tilly alone are worth the price of admission.on it, and if you are a fan, it's just another good reason to check this flick out.

B000002MP2|5.0|This CD is great! Here's my ratings of each song: <br /> <br /> Burnout- 9/10 (great intro) <br />  <br /> Having a Blast- 8.5/10 (awesome chorus!) <br /> <br /> Chump- 8/10 (it's kind of weird when you hear it for the first time) <br /> <br /> Longview- 9/10 (great introduction, like deep drums keeping a steady beat. Tre' does great on the drumming in this one.) <br /> <br /> Welcome To Paradise- 10/10 (this song is just AWESOME!) <br /> <br /> Pulling Teeth- 9.5/10 (pretty cool song) <br /> <br /> Basket Case- 10/10 (this song is really funny!) <br /> <br /> She- 8/10 (it's a strange song, but it's okay.) <br /> <br /> Sassafras Roots- 9/10 (good song) <br /> <br /> When I Come Around- 10/10 (it's really cool in the introduction. It's a just the guitar for a few seconds and then Tre' comes in on the drums. And the rest of it is great, too.) <br /> <br /> Coming Clean- 9.5/10 (when I first heard this song, I didn't understand what it was about. But now I get it.) <br /> <br /> Emenius Sleepus- 8.5/10 (it's alright.) <br /> <br /> In The End- 8/10 (nice song.) <br /> <br /> FOD- 7.5/10 (slow acoustic in the first part. It's much more quiet than the other songs, so you might want to crank your CD player up when you get to this song. But at the end, it gets louder and the electric guitar comes in.)  <br /> <br /> All By Myself (Hidden Track) <br />
B00004U2G4|5.0|When Jeff Beck was recording his first solo single \\"Hi Ho Silver Lining\\"(produced by Mickey Most,arranged by one John Paul Jones),the guitarrist summoned his mates Jimmy Page,Keith Moon and Nicky Hopkins for the flip \\"Beck's Bolero\\" written by Page(Beck wanted to play some guitar parts that Page put together around Maurice Ravel's Bolero,hence the title.Page produced and played twelve-string guitar on the piece).They liked the experience so much that thought of carrying on as a band with Small Faces vocalist Steve Marriot by Page's recommendation.This was not possible and eventually the idea was dropped as The Who and The Yardbirds had commitments to fulfill. <br />Next Beck recorded this album in full,Page formed Led Zeppelin and recorded his own offering.The result was a hammering over Page for the simmilarities found on both recordings.Who was right?,well Page produced the follow-up,Led Zeppelin II and Beck didn't,his Beckola attempted the folk-oriented material that is so characteristic of Zeppelin but without artistic success,which suggests that Truth was indeed a product of Beck's genius as a guitarrist and Page's vision as a songwriter,producer and band leader. <br />In fact,the much maligned vocal/guitar dual leads can be found on the Yardbird's \\"Little Games\\" album in the songs 'Drinking Muddy Waters'(which is a remake of \\"rollin' and tumblin'\\" that dates back to Robert Johnson ,from where the original concept originates in the first place) and the titletrack,except that at the time Page did his arrangements with harmonica and strings because Keith Relf,Yardbird's vocalist,was not up to par with wailing singers such as Marriot. <br />That said the material herein is a superb collection of the evolution of British Blues,with an experimental guitarrist(another guitarist who is currently playing in a major band had to settle for bass here),Jeff Beck,destroying conventionalisms in standards such as Muddy Waters Twist aka \\"You Shook Me\\",reworked material from his old band the Yardbirds \\"Shapes Of Things\\" making them viciously aggresive,or made a more traditiional reading of the blues in a \\"De Luxe\\" way. <br />The controversy between The Jeff Beck Group and Led Zeppelin was raised by the media and has nothing to do with the artistry of both outfits tha generously provided us with such great music that can be better appreciated by the remastering work.   <br />

B000002AHC|5.0|Although DAVID CROSBY was unfortunately fired, or possibly left, during the recording of this album, this is probably my second favorite album by THE BYRDS.  My favorite songs on this album are I WASN'T BORN TO FOLLOW and DAVID'S TRIAD.  When I first heard I WASN'T BORN TO FOLLOW on the EASY RIDER movie (at the age of 13), I heard a extremely beautiful, refreshing, and relaxing sound with outstanding country/folk/rock sound that features excellent harmony vocals by ROGER MCGUINN and CHRIS HILLMAN, the string-bending guitar playing by CLARENCE WHITE, and MICHEAL CLARKE'S drum playing.  Plus, I always think of the segment of the movie when PETER FONDA and DENNIS HOOPER are criusing along on their HARLEY DAVIDSONS in the country and picking up the hitch-hiker LUKE ASKUW.  Plus, I also like to listen to this song when I traveling in my truck on a joy ride.  DAVID delivers a smooth and softly lead vocal to his song TRIAD, and the sound of the guitars, bass guitar and drums by the musicians on this song really shine.  Furthermore, why this song was left off the original release for GOIN' BACK is definitely a mystery to me.  As for GOIN' BACK, it features excellent harmony vocals, drums, bass, 12- string and pedal steel guitar.  CHANGE IS NOW is an excellent song with CLARENCE WHITE playing guitar and the sturdy riffs of the pedal steel guitar; however, I am not sure if ROGER or CLARENCE is playing the lead guitar on this song.  The fast paced OLD JOHN ROBERTSON kicks the album into high-gear overdrive.  I love the sound of the guitars, drums, bass guitar, the orchestra, and harmony vocals, although I can not figure out the difference between this version and the YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY version.  The next two songs TRIBAL GATHERING and DOLPHIN'S SMILE that are both song by DAVID CROSBY are excellent songs too, and ARTIFICIAL ENERGY is a excellent opening song for the album with a horn section and the synthesized vocals of CHRIS and ROGER.  NATURAL HARMONY is a good song, but not the best, by CHRIS HILLMIN, and BOUND TO FALL is better than the version on the STEPHEN STILLS MANASSAS album.  On the other hand, the other songs are not my favorite.  Closing this reissue cd is UNIVERSAL MIND DECODER which is a rehearsal of CHANGE IS NOW.  Although is song is three minutes and thirty-three seconds, there is more to hear on this track.  First, there is the advertisement for this album announced by producer GARY USHER, and then comes the unpleasant and traumatic recording session, something that is not usually heard on albums, for DOLPHIN'S SMILE, which I thought was for NATURAL HARMONY.  Unfortunately, this is where the band is going down the road toward the break-up.  Most of the conflict is between the drummer MICHEAL CLARKE and DAVID CROSBY about how to play drums right while ROGER, CHRIS, and GARY are getting frustrated during the augument.  Listening to DAVID shouting, \\"TRY PLAYING RIGHT!!!!\\" and MICHEAL shouting, \\"WHAT DO YOU MEAN 'TRY PLAYING RIGHT?!?!?!?'\\" and \\"SEND ME AWAY, SEND ME AWAY!!!!\\" sound like the end of THE BYRDS.
B0006B2A2E|5.0|This is true indie material by a truly talented director (Gondrey) and a legendary writer (Kauffman.) It's something Hollywood has never seen before. Something that many don't understand as well, sadly...<br />The aura and ambience of the film are blinding and emotional, and the storyline tests the hearts and souls of the audience. The main premise of the movie (having been stated before) is very striking even though it sounds like some sort of sci-fi flick.<br />Twsting realities and rediscovering your memories isn't as easy as Carrey's character thought. Jim Carrey's and Kate Winslet's roles seem to have been switched and their love is so belivable on-screen. It's the most unlikely pairing I could think of, mostly because Carrey is used as a sensationalistic comedy-actor, while Kate is usually the lacy, lady-like, 19th century English woman.  <br />The soul-ride through the blurry and incomplete memories, coupled with a serious comedic undertone and human intervention, makes this film shine fantastically among the greatest love stories ever told on film. I recommend picking it up today if you liked Lost In Translation or any other indie movies.

B00028HBKM|2.0|I'm assuming you know what this is about, so i'll skip the plotline and jump straight to the commentary... <br /> <br />Jesus is the epitomy of complexity, honesty, and passion, and he suffered to an unbelieveable extent.  Even if you're a non-believer, you must admit that He is one of the coolest role models ever.  I was really hoping that director Mel Gibson would have dealt with the deeper issues that Jesus had, but he falls flat.   <br /> <br />The beginning of the film was dark and full of intrigue, but all I can recall after that is a whole lot of senseless violence.  The Jews are pissed, and persecution ensues.  The Romans are also on the scene, and proceed to beat the bejesus out of Jesus.  That's pretty much the jist of it, with some sparse flashbacks that fail to provide much depth.  Lots of beating...slow motion, repetitive, bloody...not for the squeamish.  Some found this powerful or shocking, I found it excessive.   <br /> <br />The sound and cinematography here are quite impressive, as is the acting of Jim Caviezel as JC.  I wish I could say more positive things, but I was just so utterly let down by this film. <br /> <br />I recommend Martin Scorsese's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" as a much more interesting movie about Jesus, as well as Carl Dreyer's \\"The Passion of Joan of Arc,\\" which is the kind of film I wish that Gibson had made.  \\"The Passion of The Christ\\" is all blood, but no guts.
0151008116|5.0|Life of Pi is a heartbreakingly beautiful examination of our will to survive under the most strenuous of circumstances. Not only does this novel examine the link between Man and Beast, but it also critiques the fine line between fanaticism and true faith.  <br />Pi is one of the most endearing characters of modern literature; he's intelligent, charming, and his faith in God is unwavering. A precocious child, Pi wishes to belong to many different religions; and in doing so wishes to broaden his knowledge of God. Of course, belonging to any specific religion does not necessarily ensure a personal relationship with God. This is what Pi acquires after his expedition with Richard Parker. <br />The adventure begins almost immediately after the ship carrying Pi and his family sinks into the murky depths of the Pacific Ocean. There are four survivors of the catastrophe: a zebra, a hyena, one bengal tiger named Richard Parker, and of course Pi himself. The zebra becomes a meal for the hyena and the hynea becomes a meal for Richard Parker. Pi soon realizes that if he doesn't supply food for Richard Parker, that he too will succumb to the same fate as the hyena. <br />Of course this motivation sets precedence for the entire tale, but don't be fooled; this novel has very little to do with consumption as it does with companionship. While Richard Parker and Pi really never become friends, the two learn to respect and tolerate each other.  <br />As stated in the beginning of this review, the novel is beautifully written. You will NOT be disappointed in purchasing this book.  <br />
B0006A9FMI|1.0|It's all been said above.  If you were lucky to see GITS 2 in the theater then you already know what a fantastic sequel it is. I won't get into the sometimes over-wrought dialog here, except to say the incredible visuals more than compensate. Unfortunately, the  poor DVD execution and lame [CLOSED CAPTION] SUB TITLES are really unexcuseable.  Definitely rent or borrow the DVD and enjoy the film, but please vote with your wallet and boycott buying this screwed up edition until the inevitable \\"Collectors Edidtion\\" with correct English sub-titles, and perhaps even a dubbed English soundtrack becomes is announced by Nightmare, er, Dreamworks.

0060090383|4.0|This was my first Marian Keyes novel. I have neglected to write a review for some reason but since I have finished reading this novel, I have read \\"Last Chance Saloon\\", \\"Watermelon\\", and \\"The Other Side of the Story\\". <br /> <br />Obviously Marian Keyes is an esquisite writer or else I wouldn't have proceeded to read three of her other novels. The Walsh Sisters are so intriguing to read about. <br /> <br />Rachel is a deeply developed character with charisma and a heart that just wants to be loved.  Her story is believeable and the remaining elements of the story make for a perfect plot. <br /> <br />Presently I have the rest of the Keyes' novels I have not read yet sitting on a self.  I cannot wait to immerse myself into the lives of the Walsh Sisters again. <br /> <br />Happy Reading!
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|I first saw this film almost fifteen years ago and was struck even then as just how fantastic a film it is.  Though it was released in the US in the 80s as 'Warriors of the Wind', it was abridged and most of the drama of the film was lost.  It has been a source of wonder to me that such films, so much more intimate and sincere than nearly anything our own animated film creators has procuded, have remained viewable only to those willing to struggle with the original Japanese language or second rate fan-subtitlers. <br /> <br />This film, and several others also of Miyazaki's creation, remain some of my favorites.  Disney bought the rights to release them, and it is flatly astounding that so few have been released as yet. <br /> <br />At any rate, this is a simply wonderful film, as anyone who has seen it will say, and I can't recommend it enough.  Further, support of these recent studio Ghibli releases will hopefully cause the other, more obscure films to be released as well. One can only hope.

1567184855|2.0|I have read a lot of books on life after death and they vary greatly.  Journey of Souls is down at the bottom of the crediblity meter but it does have a few chapters that are entertaining. <br /> <br />  The book is made up of interviews the author, a trained hypnotist, compiled from his patients while under hypnosis.   <br />A brief summary of the book goes something like this: <br /> After we depart this world we find ourselves being rapidly transported to our heavenly home via some people mover, kind of like the ones found in many airports except these move much quicker, like the speed of light quicker.  There is even a grand central station where our paths cross as we hurry along to pick up our \\"ride\\", everyone seems to be in a big hurry to get to their \\"home\\".  Once you get to your \\"home\\" it is simply a clump of other souls, sort of like a bunch of grapes, and you are just one of the grapes.  And these dozen or so soul friends are your eternal buddies.  There is very little contact with the billions of other souls, forget spending eternity with grandparents or other loved ones but if you miss them you can communicate telepathically.  Each bunch of grapes has their own guidance counselor.  We spend all our time learning, by life review and study preparing for our next incarnation.   <br /> <br />After a while all the interviews start sounding the same.  The questions by the author are extremely leading.  He directs his clients to pretty much say what he wants to hear or expects to hear. And what he expects or wants really lacks imagination, if the afterlife is that dull I hope I live for a long, long time.  <br /> <br />   <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005NRO3|5.0|scream 1- funny god not scary at alll <br /> <br />scream 2- funny makes u jump time to time, and teh best out of them <br /> <br />scream3-terrible acting, odd storyline, and stupid.
B00005JMUA|5.0|The story of Kill Bill blends all elements of great storytelling and moviemaking into an original and enthralling emotional roller coaster that doesn't let go and can be almost draining. At least, that is what I have found. It creates 'catharsis' (involves the audience through feelings of fear and pity)! Indeed, it's not a movie you can just watch at any old moment, or too soon again afterward, or view lightly. And I can't put on Volume 1 without seeing it through to completion within a short time. It takes a very special kind of film to have this sort of effect on me personally, and I find these two halves of a whole film to be just the right type; therefore I heartily recommend them to all who consider watching it but haven't yet. It's heavy, high-powered, charged, and flows from one monumental scene to another almost without consideration for the viewer. And superb quotes? There are too many to count. All in all, utterly brilliant.
630521610X|4.0|the 2nd one is better, but yet the beginning to this is pretty sick when the phone calls start and stuff.although the 2nd is better they didnt have matt lillard for their comedian act as stu, i was mad he was the killer and dies because hes a aweswome actor and funny as hell but still this is one of teh best movies i ever seen
B0001DI0FI|1.0|The movie was allright, nothing to get excited about.I often read while watching a movie. If a movie is good enough to really command my attention, I stop reading. This movie did not command my attention.  <br />The worst thing about it was that there was no ending. The movie just stopped in the middle of something. Im sorry I spent the money.
6305903182|3.0|ok scream 2 and scream 1 are amazing , this 1 isnt too good because it kinda changes the story line of all teh films and the acting isnt godo at all its got teh worst acting ive ever seen besides house of the dead. theyr the only reasons i didnt like this movie
B00005MAM2|5.0|1. The understandable complaints that this version changed what people grew up with. I disagree, and belive that its an excellent change personally, but I also know the effects of audio are severe on nostalgic memory's. <br /> <br />Seems like the original fan base is suffering more from personal attachment issues than a lack of taste really. Its hard to fall in love with something only to have it changed, even if for the better(or worse ..) Since the rythem of something you have watched will be off just enough to bug you.  <br /> <br />In this case I would warn against people who are long time loyal fans, most of these people got the movie by now probably, less hardcore longtime fans who rememmber the movie, and just now wanna re-live it probably won't notice the change. <br />  <br />2. the Second catagory of complaints are the kids that watch anime for all the wrong reasons, Kids with too much of an appitite for mindless action and violence that looks more interesting when being animated, even more dramatic. To say this movie is boring, followed by numerous complaints of not understanding it definitly leads me to belive that this kids watched this movie waiting for some kind of major action sequences. <br /> <br />T^his movie starts of with a mild action bang in the form of a bike sequence, this sort of speed racer sequence comes back later on in the the sewers, and there is a few I'm a super human badass psyche stuff, but the reality is this movie is a much more subtle Sci-fi epic styled movie. With many layers and multiple story line clashes, it build a tapestry of more down to earth stroys about friendship and power struggeles. The ending that most of the kids complain about being long ( or they don't understand ..) Is very spiritual, and is one of my favorite endings ever, in any movie anime- or elsewhere.  <br /> <br />One of the reason Akira became what is was . had nothing to do with it bein the first anything. the reason It was such a powerful movie is its abilty to trancend anime. To become something more than an animated movie. Many people who in america actually first viewed this movie with a group of other movies that exploded about the same time thanks mostly to  sci-fi network, and word of mouth of friends. Lots of them watched other anime beforehand, and this is the one that actually stuck with them and really made them understand that it was more than \\"cartoons\\". I myself Remember seeing the Project Ak-O stuff, and dominion tank police stuff, and at the time was really into Project Ak-O. It was this movie that I always look back at as the definitive anime \\"motion picture\\".  <br /> <br />I still will pull out and watch this DVD first when showing anime to friends that haven't watched much  <br /> <br />
B0006B29WA|5.0|Franz Ferdinand's debut cd is one of the best post-punk cds to be released in the last decade, plus its just so damn groovy and catchy as hell!!! My new favourite band!!!
B00003BDXG|5.0|watch, or don't watch it I could care less.     It's the best movie I have ever seen. With the greatest soundtrack I have ever heard. ( the Downward spiral and NIN.. are also my favorite album/band .. with out question)    I love even the tiny little details and even the cinimatic mess ups in this movie. ..    I grew up in oklahoma city when this movie came out, and it really captures this feeling or rage and contempt you get growing up surrounded by all those corrupt bible hugging freaks that in reality are the scum of the earth. They plague your life constantly with the Candy Coated hate-mongering and close minded view of life. Don't know if it was intended or just a part of the great choas of life, but this movie just really speaks to me. I really don't care if it speaks to anybody else anymore.
6302886228|5.0|Its impossible to exaggerate how good this concert is.  Most tribute type concerts don't live up to the hype.  This one does.  Great performances throughout.  A shame its not on DVD.  Overall, the audio and video quality of the VHS is first rate (for VHS).  Pretty much all the artists come through with outstanding performances of their songs though the Johnny Cash/June Carter rendition of It Ain't Me Babe comes off like a throw away.  Also, includes the historic appearance of Sinead O'Connor to a chorus of boos shortly after her SNL \\"incident\\". If this is the low point, its quickly overcome by a couple of great Neil Young performances to end Tape #1.  Tape #2 continues the momentum and ends in stunning fashion with Roger McGuinn and the \\"man\\" himself.  With all the crap being released on DVD, its hard to believe this one is still in the can.
0553573411|2.0|I rather enjoyed the first book in this series and was excited to get book two.  But the second book was a disappoinment overall. <br /> <br />Conflict and problems are vital for the development of a book's plot.  However, a good book will effectively mask the usage of conflicts to keep the reader's interest and this is where Royal Assassin fails.  The conflicts created are nonstop, take up too many words and feel overtly manipulative.  The protaganist revels in his insecurities for far too long and passes up far too many opportunities to just Do Something.  To many oversights defy belief and exist only to further suspend resolution of the plot.  Conflict upon conflict piles up in a manner that does not support a sympathetic and heroic character and Fitz is compromised as a protaganist that the reader can get invested in.  The huge insecurities and depression indicated by the Fitz are simply incompatible with the expectation that he will, actually, do something heroic at some point and are jarring when compared to the few scenes where he actually does act heroically.  Early on in the book he goes about several difficult tasks with aplomb and complete confidence only to later dwell in doubt and despair for pages upon pages, over seemingly much simpler tasks.  We are given a few hints that each resolution might lead him to future confidence or a break-through in his abilities only to find him even more useless for the next task he must undertake. <br /> <br />Part of the problem is that the set of powers chosen for this world, the Skill in particular, is simply far too powerful and could easily solve massive plot problems in a very quick and easy manner -- if allowed to do so.  Obviously such a Deus Ex Machina plot would not satisfy.  Thus excuse after excuse is thrown at us to describe how, yet again, the protaganists fail to do much of use with the all-powerful Skill.  Similarly the first book ended with a fairly decent resolution that was immediately contradicted in the beginning of the second book.  It's easy to see how this might have happened (after getting published on the first book there was a need to drum up new drama to start the second) but the result is a let-down and seemed to ruin the feeling of fulfillment from the first book.   <br /> <br />Heroic fiction is a genre about wish-fulfillment.  We love to see our favorite characters relish in their hard-earned victories and we love to see them develop and gain in confidence and strength.  This book however kills the satisfaction at prior accomplishments and has a protaganist that fails to develop much more satisfaction in terms of development or further accomplishments.  At the end I was left annoyed and unfulfilled and liking the characters far less than I had after the first book, thus missing what I see as the necessity of Heroic Fantasy Fiction.  As Fantasy readers, we don't just want conflict/resolution we also want a relatively monotonic growth of the characters towards being heros. <br /> <br />I also agree that the series, thus far, lacks any exploration of grayer morality and fails to break the mold of idealized, Good/Bad characterization.  That is a bit of a disappointment but is something I tend to expect from the genre.  So I won't hark too much on that point. <br /> <br />Because of my enjoyment of the first book I will read reviews and maybe scan through book 3.  I still have some lingering interest in seeing how things end up for Fitz and so maybe I'll stick it out.  I think Hobb has it in her to write very good stories but I think this one, ultimately, failed.
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This is one of the best record I have heard in a long time!!!
B00064MW6A|5.0|I read the movie reviews that panned the movie and yet when I bought it on DVD I found it to be quite good. I enjoyed it.
B00000099Y|5.0|Amazing album (in my opinion) and personally i think tools best anyway if your not into long/really long songs (although they are really good!!) then dont waste your time with this cd. If your not into taking songs beyond face value and figureing out their true meanings...then, again, dont waste your time with this album. If youve heard about how great tool is but have never heard them or want to check them out then i would say this is the cd to get.
B0006A9FMI|2.0|I didn't see the movie but I was waiting for the dvd.To my horror the subtitles destroy the film and there are no english <br />voices over the japan version.The artwork is great but this film is very hard to enjoy and I feel I really wasted my money. <br />I hope Dreamworks does recall this film.These films take a very long time to make at least give the animation fans their money's <br />worth.
B0000025D0|5.0|When Springsteen was churning out his biggest hits I must have been around nine years old. Suffice to say I missed Born in the U.S.A when it hit the market. Come puberty I started to discover Rock & Roll. Who didn't. The Boss just disbanded the E-street band and recorded the Human Touch. With teststerone raging through my body I let the Boss pas by. I don't think anybody can blame me. His albums by than were disastrous. The Red Hot Chilli Peppers and Nirvana were just more apt for my needs at the time. The boss wasn't cool enough. To stadiumrock. Happily every band of brothers has one in their midst who just won't walk the line. He was a Springsteen fan and managed to catch me by suprise by playing Adam Raised a Cain without telling me who it was. I was amused by it at the time but it wasn't untill years later when I bought the album I realised how good it really is.  <br /> <br />This album truly is the one where his songwriting and big sound come together perfectly. The album does a better job at teenage angst than Nirvana ever did. Springsteen's main strength is as a story teller. And he had some stories to tell. Most compelling racing in the street. It's bleak scenery is perfect for cars. Someway adding colour to dismal lifes where there is none. Badlands is Rock and Roll gospel. Candy's room's fierce sexual energy. Springsteen should've made this album when I was fifteen. I would've learned how to play the guitar and would've become a stadiumrocker. Now I'm just punching my fist in the air with other overaged Springsteen addicts.

0140042520|5.0|<br />Man, I don't know where to start. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is a masterpiece of the Beat Generation and a novel I will not soon forget. After The Loser's Club by Richard Perez, this is the best book I've read all year. <br /> <br />Jack Kerouac wrote this story about his days as a Zen Buddhist and rucksack wanderer. His alias in the book is Raymond Smith, and he is living in Berkley with his good buddy Alvah Goldbook(Allen Ginsburg). Ray meets a Zen Lunatic named Japhy Ryder(Gary Snyder), and together they travel the mountains and pastures of Central California trying to find themselves and find the true meaning of life. Ray also journies to Desolation Peak in Washington and lives there alone for the summer, which is just another chapter to this amazing piece of literature. <br /> <br />Another part of this book that impressed me was the beginning, when Kerouac wrote about his experience at the San Francisco Poetry Renaissance, and spoke of Alvah Goldbook's first reading of his poem \\"Wail\\", which in reality was Allen Ginsburg's legendary first reading of \\"Howl\\", which to this day is a Beat Literature classic.  <br /> <br />While reading this book, I was constantly marking lines and passages, because some of the descriptions and poetry Kerouac included in this novel are simply amazing. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is one of those books I will treasure forever and read over and over again. <br />
0670032506|5.0|Fifty-two power-packed principles that stir, awaken and inspire.  What a great way to spur me forward in all my endeavors.  I highly recommend this book for all -- in business or not.  Spiritual and practical gift.  Thank you David Allen.
0812548094|4.0|Stone of Tears is the second in a series of books revolving around the epic battle of good versus evil.  In this book, Terry touches many times on the point that the line between good and evil can, at times, be distorted by our views.  With the addition of characters not in the first book, the author weaves a web of hope mixed with despair; love mixed with hatred; and truth with lies.  You find yourself at constant odds on what to think about each character and verbally yelling at them to see the obvious or to stop being obtuse.  All in all, it's a great read and I couldn't put it down.
B00004Z4SD|4.0|The DVD case said, \\"Also recommended: *Spitfire Grill*, *Fried Green Tomatoes* and *On Golden Pond*.\\" But if you've seen those, you've seen this. And, if you *like* those (and I do), you'll like this. This is not really Sissy's story, though - it belongs to Richard Farnsworth, who died immediately afterward. An unexpected turn by director Lynch (*Blue Velvet* and *Wild At Heart*), without any of the irony and surrealism that he thrives on. A gorgeous score emphasizes the endless sweeping shots of America The Beautiful, with the attendant spacious skies and amber waves of grain. This is the backdrop for the story of Alvin Straight (Farnsworth), who, for a variety of reasons, decides to drive his lawnmower 300+ miles to see his brother. It is a true story, and you know right off the bat, that this is going to be a tearjerker - Alvin is increasingly infirm at 73, and learns that his estranged brother has had a stroke. He lives with his daughter, Rose (Spacek), who is \\"slow.\\" This is the most mature Sissy yet - she could rest on her laurels and still be hailed as a major actress entering her fourth decade of moviemaking - though in this, she is a minor, but unforgettable, character, and has excellent assistance from the other supporting cast. The reunion between the elderly brothers looms large throughout the last half. As snapshot-like vignettes spin by, we are propelled towards the inevitable meeting, which promises to be a gusher - but isn't. Though it ends rather abruptly when Alvin shows up at his brother's place six weeks later, the story has been told, gloriously.
B00006FDCD|3.0|When I was in the 4th grade I saw this movie at Wal-Mart and thought,\\"That looks scary\\".Then people told me about the movie and I wanted to see it but I was sort of too scared to watch it but finally in 6th grade(two years ago) someone bought it for me & I watched it.It wasn't terrifying but I think Pennywise looks scary.I still cover my ears and close my eyes when Laurie Ann sees him behind the closeline.I think the movie would be better if they didn't do the stupid Stan's head in the fridge and the bugs and gross stuff in the fortune cookies.Ok well enyways the movie is about a small New England town in 1960.A demon? keeps attacking kids who come to a creek in the woods and the demon takes form of a clown to attract clowns and he will only hurt you if you are afraid of him.7 friends decide to take a stand and fight him but 30 years later(1990) several kids are killed and when Mike(one of the principle characters) is at a crimescene he finds a pic. of a character named George(Goergie) and then knows that it is Pennywise(the demon) he calls his friends and only 5 show up instead of 6 and they decide to have a final showdown.It is a very good movie.I liked it very much.
0783240236|5.0|This movie scared me to death when I was five. My parents had dumped the four of us at a theatre for the afternoon and two hours later, I was a swollen, puffy mess, still sobbing from the horror I had witnessed. That was over 40 years ago, but you'd think it happened yesterday, the way my sister still sadistically laughs at me for being so frightened. I no longer react with fear upon seeing the movie - but it is with a wizened eye that I now look at the scenes that had such impact: and they're still some of the scariest scenes put on film. Done entirely without music, the scenes unreel with alarming suspense. The theme of nature-run-amok has been made into mincemeat in the decades since, but seldom with such a deft touch. Much is made about the outdated special effects, but they are mild compared to the overusage in modern films. Tippi Hedren, whom Hitchcock spotted in a diet drink commercial and became his latest obsession, makes her debut as the cool and soignee Melanie Daniels, socialite-at-large. Hedren, who named her daughter Melanie (Griffith) after her character, subsequently had a less-than-stellar career, starring in such classics as *Teresa's Tattoo* and *Return to Green Acres*. The plotline involving Daniels and her pursuit of attorney Mitch Brenner definitely has problems, but seems necessary to create the atmosphere and set the stage for the real stars of the movie - the birds. There are so many birds in this movie, billing and cooing with an innocence that belies their malevolence, that the nightmare unfolding on the screen must have been rivaled by the nightmare on the set. Tales of tranquilizing the birds and wiring them in place surely would cause distress among animal-rights activists today. Jessica Tandy is chill and formidable as Mitch's mother, Lydia, and Suzanne Pleshette, as schoolteacher Annie Hayworth, is one of the most interesting characters in the movie. And her final scene is most memorable, as she is found facedown in front of her home,pecked to death.  <br />The climactic attack that takes place at Mitch's home is sheer brilliance. As the birds are pecking through the door and gathering in the attack, there is a sense of madness unleashed that is breathtaking. The ambiguity of the ending has been roundly criticized - but it is most successful in leaving behind a sense that the story is not quite over. Of course, it wasn't quite over - it had to be insulted with a sequel, *The Birds II*. The film has acquired a certain campiness over the years that allows the sophisticated viewer to look past the obvious plot devices, and find an arch humor in the classic scenes. From Melanie getting clocked on the forehead by a seagull, to the crotchety ornithologist at the caf, to the scene with the guy whose eyes have pecked out, to the amassing of the birds at the schoolhouse, where the children are singing what is surely the longest children's song ever written, the scenes are imprinted indelibly on our memories. So much so, that Tippi has become a popular Halloween costume - just pin a bird in your wig, and you're instantly Melanie Daniels. It's easy to laugh at something that used to be scary, but is there anyone that doesn't think of *The Birds* whenever they see more than a dozen of perched on a powerline?
1400034779|4.0|This is a sweet read.   <br /> <br />If you sit back, relax and start reading - it feels as though the main character is telling you a story while you're both sitting on her porch in the heat of an African afternoon with all the time in the world.  <br /> <br />You'll find yourself transported to a world away, where things move slower, gadgets are non-existent and the perspective refreshing. I love the way the author matches the tone and pace of the book perfectly to the main character and the setting. <br /> <br />A sweet, easy-going read about a time and place where values and character are the riches in life.
0792844882|5.0|Among the newest entries into the Bad Movie Hall of Fame, *Showgirls* is an instant classic -it wants to be *All About Eve*, but stops short of *Valley of the Dolls*. Trying desperately to be a morality tale with a twist, it fails so completely, that the viewer, short of leaving the theatre, is held prisoner to its lurid charm. With the minimally talented Elizabeth Berkley playing the skanky Nomi Malone (she might be alternately known as \\"Gnome-y\\" Malone, or \\"Know Me\\" Malone), a former juvenile delinquent who has just graduated from jail-bait status and hitchhikes to Las Vegas to be a lapdancer. I mean, showgirl. Things start off badly for her, and it becomes evident immediately that she would benefit from anger-management classes. After losing her luggage and money, she is mysteriously befriended by a young woman - mysterious, because it is unimaginable that a stranger would offer assistance to someone so unstable, unpleasant and so trashy-looking. But we *are * talking about Las Vegas here. Gnomey's new friend is a wardrobe mistress at the casino for the show *Goddess* is playing, and sneaks Gnomey in to watch behind the scenes. It is here that Gnomey meets Cristal Connors, played with dazzling authenticity by Gina Gershon, a senior showgirl who calls everyone \\"Darlin',\\" and does a lot of cocaine. Originally envisioning Madonna as Cristal and Drew Barrymore as Gnomey, the scriptwriting is cruder than it needs to be, but that is part of its charm. Supporting characters further underscore the bottom-of-the-barrel approach to storytelling - from the owner of the strip club where Gnomey works, to the sleazy \\"choreographer\\" who pursues her, to her fellow \\"dancers,\\" we are treated to a cattle call of unpleasant stereotypes. The scenes are awash in tawdriness that is supposed to represent the underbelly of American life, where everyone's a whore. A dire pronouncement, to be sure, but far more indicative of Verhoeven's state, than America's. As far as being the brilliantsatire it was purported to be, that sounds like someone trying to put a good spin on an awful movie. Truly awful. Like a car wreck you can't take your eyes off of.
B00011D1RC|3.0|The movie is relentlessly grim, even in it's lighter moments. Garbo and John Barrymore's hammy scenes together are embarrassing. <br /> <br />But John is really endearing in his scenes with brother Lionel Barrymore. Also, Joan Crawford (!) gives the most understated and brilliant performance of the entire cast. <br /> <br />Worth a look, but as a whole is a little heavy-handed.
B00003CXFV|4.0|Julia Roberts is winsome and not at all cloying in this *Silkwood* meets *Love Canal* meets *Marie* meets *Pretty Woman* extravaganza. In fact, I'd almost admit I'm beginning to like her, now that I've gotten past all the years of oppressive hype. But it's not her fault. She seems like a genuinely nice woman who is growing up to be a competent actress. And *Erin Brockovich* supplies her with just the kind of role that the world like's to see her in - beleaguered but with spunk (an often repellant combination). She plays the real-life whistle-blower of the title (the real Erin has a role as a waitress in the movie), and proves she's a real actress by following the time-honored path beaten by Hollywood actresses since time immemorial - playing white trash. But, of course, she's white trash with a heart of gold, who cares only about taking care of her three children, and finding justice in the world. With her bra showing most of the time, and her New Jersey-deluxe hair, she actually does a credible job of it, and that's where it's possible to develop compassion for her character. And thank God for that - for without her, there's little else memorable about this movie that makes it any different than the kind of movies made for the Lifetime channel. Finney is excellent as her boss, and the handsome Latham is wasted as the boyfriend when the love story just kind of fizzles out. Many say it's the best work Roberts has done. I wouldn't know. But, I'm always a sucker for seeing the little guy win against the behemoth powers-that-be, and even though it's been done over and over again (*A Civil Action* ring any bells? *Norma Rae*?)
0792833236|5.0|I still see this movie as I viewed it in the theatre.  I can't see it any other way.  Television, unless it's a wide screen and with surround sound, doesn't do this film justice.  The boxing scenes are incredible.  The film editing was well deserved of an Oscar.  What it should have also won for was Best Sound.  It is a wild ride!  Couple that with the great perfomances of DeNiro, Pesci & Moriarty and you have one of the greatest biopics ever made.
B00001PE4D|3.0|I'm not sure I would have understood *Dangerous Liasons* when I was a teenager. Fortunately for teenagers today, we have *Cruel Intentions*. Reading the viewers' comments on various websites, it become readily apparent that many people enjoyed this movie more than I did. It's also apparent that many people who wrote the comments are young teenagers, who think Ryan Phillippe is a fabulous actor. I am not among that group, either. Ryan Phillippe is pretty. That is the nicest thing we can say. The film seems so amateurish, it is a shame to waste such a great story on such a minimally talented cast - it comes across with made-for-TV acting quality that can't begin to grasp the nuances of the story. Phillippe's real-life wife, Reese Witherspoon, is somewhat adequate as Annette, the daughter of the school's new headmaster. The reasonably respectable Sarah Michelle Geller tries her hardest to be wicked as Kathryn, but is a little out of her league on the big screen. Selma Blair as Cecile Caldwell is dreadful. Christine Baranski is her usual snippy self, as Cecile's mother, and Swoosie Kurtz is a surprise since she played Cecile's mother in an earlier version. Though with nice production values, the movie still falls into the *Heathers* and *The Craft* sorts of productions - perfectly geared towards their not-very-discriminating audiences who are blinded by their high-style. Not that high-style is meaningless - it just begs for some content to back it up. But I probably would have loved this when I was a teenager, since it was set in a milieu I understood: high school. A glamorous high school, to be sure, swank and private, but still loaded with the deadly vipers and demons that infest every high school - and it would have been more fun to attend, just to watch the manipulations of this clique. This is the promise offered by the movie to all teenagers, and in that respect, it succeeds very well.
6305499365|4.0|A few years ago, monster.com instantly became famous with a Super Bowl commercial that featured a group of little children dreaming about growing up to hold unrewarding, miserable jobs.   The kids said things like, \\"When I grow up, I wanna file all day...I wanna claw my way up to middle-management...I wanna be a Yes-Man.\\"  \\"Office Space\\" tells the story of a group of workers who hold such jobs.      Peter, the film's lead character, suffers with the realization that his work has no meaning.  To his company, the workers are simply cogs in the machine, interchangeable and unnecessary.  Their salaries and benefits convince them that they cannot live without their jobs, so they pretend to love their work, constantly justifying and rationalizing employment that numbs the spirit.           Peter describes his life as a never-ending string of days that continue to trump the previous with degrees of misery and angst.  He comes to work late, avoids his boss and tries to do as little work as possible, taking pride in the hours each week he spends \\"spacing out\\" in front of his computer.  He works with equally miserable employees who spend their days dreaming about destroying the copying machine and longing for the former model of stapler that the company once used.      After a Jerry Maguire-esque epiphany, Peter decides office cubicle life is not for him and the action of the film is set in place.  His rebellion against his place of employment creates an ironic twist, as his forthright disdain for the procedures and protocols of the company earns him a reputation for honesty and outside-the-box thinking.      A subplot grows from Peter's infatuation with a local waitress who finds herself in an equally unrewarding job.   Her boss paradoxically pressures her to seek individuality that conforms to other employees.    She has no problem finding common ground with cubicle slaves who spend their days doing just enough to keep from getting fired.      Politically, the film lashes out against jobs that force workers to constantly repeat tasks and procedures until they can do their jobs without thought.  The duties drain workers of creativity and uniqueness, building a graveyard of zombie-like beings who spout out acronyms and lingo in robot-like monotones.   Those familiar with this type of work environment will find the film to be painfully funny.
B0002UOK04|5.0|Imagine a perfect combination of Children of Bodom, early Arcturus, and Dissection, and you'll have an idea of what this album sounds like. Jari is a virtuosic guitarist and really good song writer. Many of the riffs and melodies are catchy and folk-like. Additionally there are many neoclassical sections..circle of fifths progressions, diminished runs and vivaldi violin type melodies in the guitar.     The album also has a nice mix of mid paced and fast songs, which is not common in the world of metal especially varieties which tend towards the Black Metal end of the spectrum.    The vocals are nice, too. There are both clean vocals and growling. Though they aren't quite operatic power vocals, they are well done and fit nicely with the music.    As usual in black metal, the lyrics are somewhat silly, but taken for what they are they fit fine with the music.    When all is said and done though most people who listen to this sort of music are satisfied primarily by the excellent craftsmanship of the music, which you will find here in spades. 5 stars.
1400032717|4.0|This book is written from the perspective of Christopher Boone, a 15-year-old autistic boy who lives in England.  Author Mark Haddon shows an uncanny knack of getting inside the boy's head and relating things from his black-and-white world.  His world must be orderly or Christopher has a hard time functioning.  He does advanced math problems in his head in order to calm down in stressful situations.  He is presented with a lot of stress when his parents disappoint him, each in a different way.  He feels forced to make his way across England on his own to elude perceived danger and he overcomes situations which are fraught with frustration for him.  His parents show a lot of compassion at times, but his idiosyncrocies sometimes get the best of them.  This is an amazing book, which probably shows the reader more about the way an autistic person thinks than would many textbooks on the subject.
B00008PW2D|2.0|The fifth season seems to have lost its way on the trip from the first to the sixth season. With a few exceptional moments, the rest of it was a sad let down. The only good part of the fifth season is that it sets up the sixth season which is the best of the six.
B000067G3C|5.0|In the past decade or so there has been a plethora of Hollywood action films.  Most have been absolute dross.  \\"Speed\\", however, is a notable exception.<br /><br />For a two hour period, \\"Speed\\" keeps the viewer glued to his seat as we watch Keanu Reeves attempt to foil the efforts of Dennis Hopper using hostages to keep the city of Los Angeles at ransom.  Both Reeves and Hopper are excellent in their roles.<br /><br />Yes, I know it can be argued that the film's plot is perhaps absurd.  However, don't let this point obscure an edge of the seat story that still resonates well in 2005 after debuting in cinemas in 1994.<br /><br />Whether for the first or umpteenth time, \\"Speed\\" is a great ride.
B00005K3NR|4.0|Sissy, pole-vaulting into immortality by playing the avenging angel of all oppressed and abused teenagers. Holding up as a camp classic for nearly 30 years, as well as being referenced and spoofed in many other films, *Carrie* is a spectacular production that radically upped the ante for future teen-scream horror fests. As the socially-retarded, but secretly powerful Carrie White, Spacek plays her character with a sincerity that is heartbreaking. When, as part of a vengeful joke, she is elected Prom Queen, and is doused with a bucket of pig's blood, her powers of telekinesis go wild, and everybody pays. DePalma takes us on a wild visual ride, with breathtaking cinematography - an opening sequence of the girls' locker room is as dreamy and erotic as odalisque painting by Ingres, but it quickly devolves to one of the most distressingly graphic and disturbingly camp scenes in all filmdom - that of the menstruating Carrie on the floor of the shower being pelted with Kotexes by her classmates screaming, \\"Plug it up! Plug it up!\\" The scene is only the first of many ugly surprises DePalma has up his sleeve.  <br />     It is Sissy's stock-in-trade to play a character who has deep respect for (yet rebels against) her upbringing - often that of ignorant (but never stupid) white-trash from a bad gene-pool. In most films, she ultimately rises above her milieu and proves that a good heart will conquer all. *Carrie* is no exception, even though Sissy's character does not survive this one. It is the physical change from the impossibly-freckled, socially-retarded waif into the vision of 70s loveliness that enters into many of Sissy's portrayals, and Sissy expresses these changes in such a way to make the viewer look forward to them. She does not disappoint. Many aspects of the film have entered into the lexicon of film - the famous bucket of blood falling in slow motion sets off the ugly chain of events culminating in mayhem that has seldom been portrayed more shatteringly than the conflagration at the prom. The split-screen recording of the bloodbath at the end, cutting away all sound except for the dripping of blood, is magnificent. As quotable as *Valley Of The Dolls* and *All About Eve* (\\"I should have killed myself after the first time he put it in me.\\" \\"I might have known it would be red.\\" \\"I can see your dirty pillows.\\" \\"Take off the dress, we'll burn it together and pray for forgiveness.\\"), *Carrie* will live -and die - forever.
B000092ZYX|5.0|To me, this is their second best effort. The best being of course, \\"OK Computer.\\" I was a little concerned after the way they produced Kid A and Amnesiac. As much as I love Radiohead, those two albums had the most uneven quality of songs I have ever witnessed. They would follow up a song that had just floored me with a song that is complete and utter crap. The end result left me feeling that the albums were unfinished and rushed.     Fortunately, it seems they have learned from their mistakes and released an album that you can actually listen to all the way through without skipping any tracks. Every song on this cd is amazing! In my eyes, Radiohead has totally redeemed themselves and then some. Good show, guys. Keep the albums comin'.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|As an avid avril fan, i was extremely excited to hear that her 2nd cd was on the shelves! here ive critiqued all of the songs: <br /> <br />1.) take me away: 10/10, a great great opening song.  <br />2.) together, 10/10 nice melody, really shows off her musical abilities. awesome song. <br />3.) dont tell me: 8/10, i dont think this song is very flattering to her in some parts. it makes her voice sound funny, but it has a good message too it. good song. <br />4.) he wasn't: 8/10: can be annoying, but a good song. im not real fond of the lyrics, but a good song nonetheless. <br />5.) how does it feel: 9/10: a great great song, its slow, thats why i gave it a 9, but an awesome song if you're feeling down. <br />6.) my happy ending: 11/10: one of my favorite songs on the cd, great message, she sounds GREAT and the instruments are very noticable in the backround. the instrumentals really make the song. <br />7.) nobodys home: 11/10: my favorite song on the whole cd, she sounds really really good, and the guitar sounds great. its one of those would-be depressing songs, but for some reason it dosnt make you depressed, it makes you feel like you can take on anything. a great girl-power song, for some reason. <br />8.) forgotten: 10/10, a really great song, sort of sounds like the others, but a great message to it. her voice sounds good, but not as good as in some of the other songs. <br />9.) who knows: 14/10: This song is just awesome. Its positive, but not too pop-y. It a great feel-good song. <br />10.) fall to peices: 9/10, a strange follow-up to who knows. very dark, but a great great very well-done song.  <br />11.) freak out: 8/10: my least favorite song, i dont really like the placement on the cd. it sounds more like her 1st cd, but its not bad. i just dont really care for it. electric guitar is awesome, however. <br />12.) slipped away: 10/10, a great end to the cd, very sad but has a great meaning to it. she dedicated it to her late grandfather, and i really likethe song. its soft but still edgy, and its vague enough so that it would make a great song for the loss of anyone, or just when you're feeling down. great, great song. <br /> <br />    overall, this cd is awesome. its got a great variety, and really deserves some attention. its much more mature than comlicated, but it still targets a wide range of ages. a must have for any pop/rock cd collector, or anyone who needs someone to realate to when life just dosn't go their way. BUY THIS CD NOW!
0156027321|5.0|With over 1200 reviews already posted as of today, there's really no point in me adding to the madness by recapping the whole story again. Obviously you already know essentially what the book is about, so let me just add my five stars to the mix by saying that this is one of the best works of fiction I have ever read. The combination of Martel's poetic writing style and his use of rich metaphors to provide stunningly vivid descriptions of things and events results in an a story so absorbing that I was unable to put it down and raced through it in nearly record time. In short, there's a very good reason why this book is so popular.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|One of the best films of the past decade has been made even better.  Though the director's cut makes the film slightly more easily explained, it in no way detracts from the sense of mystery.  Plenty of questions still remain.  The added scenes also explore more of the family relationships and add a greater degree of humanity and humor to the film.  Highly recommended, even if you already own the original cut.  This is definitive.  A job VERY well done.
B00030590I|5.0|If you liked Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, then you'll love this one for sure (and vise versa)!    Like Crouching Tiger, Hero is based in the Warring States Era of Chinese history--the time of Sun Tzu, about 300 BC.  The Warring States Era established the Chin Dynasty, and the roots of modern China start here.  So, by comparison, the Warring States tales are similar to American Wild West stories.    A tale of intrigue, the story twists, turns, and never stales.   A mysterious swordsman claims to have eliminated three legendary assassins... but the wise king senses something not quite right.  After Nameless, the swordsman, tells his story, the king tells his story.  Then, there's the Truth... The movie uses different colors to tell each person's viewpoint, and it makes the story very cool!      A classic tale from a classic era.  A must have for your DVD library!
B00005JKG5|3.0|*Flashdance* -- what a feeling. What an icky, sticky feeling, like cotton candy that you can't get off your fingers -- total Eighties swill that has failed to congeal over time. So many funny, and so many dreadful moments that peck at the memory like a relentless chicken: Jennifer Beals dancing frenetically in place to the unbearable \\"Maniac\\", removing her bra without removing her sweatshirt, digging her foot into the guys crotch under the table...and the fashion statement - it is one of those rare movies that has a huge impact on fashion. Who among us wasn't ripping our sweatshirts to shreds and wearing legwarmers? Well, maybe not all of us, true...but she was certainly the most stylish welder to come down the pike in quite awhile. But *Flashdance* is not anything so much as a two hour music video about achieving your dream. Winning Oscars, Golden Globes and Grammys, the soundtrack was a huge success. Selling 700,000 copies in two weeks, not only for the title track, but for the regrettably aforementioned \\"Maniac\\" by Michael Sembello, \\"Romeo\\" by Donna Summer, and \\"He's A Dream\\" by Shandi, the soundtrack, along with the look, still haunts aerobics studios today. \\"When you let go of your dream, you die.\\" But he's wrong - when you listen to dialogue like that, you die.
B000093FLA|4.0|4.5 stars.  Guy Ritchie's first film was the energetic \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\" with its kinetic film editing and highly creative direction.  Much like Quentin Tarantino's first film \\"Reservoir Dogs\\" Guy Ritchie's first film was not as polished as their respective follow-up films.  For Quentin Tarantino his next creation was the landmark film \\"Pulp Fiction\\" which improved on every aspect of his first endeavor but with a more complicated storyline and more streamlined direction.  The same can be said of Guy Ritchie's second film, \\"Snatch.\\"  His first film was fun and often exhilarating with its stylshly shot gun fights and elegant camera work.  But with \\"Snatch\\" the end result is more fluid, the interwoven plot-lines loaded with interesting characters and snappy British slang and wit (some of which may be a bit difficult to pick up on for first-time viewers).  \\"Snatch\\" also has a fine cast of international actors, easily the most notable being Brad Pitt (a bare-kuckle boxing champion gypsy) who steals every scene he is in.  No other character is as memorable as his, but all have their moments.  The actual filmmaking in \\"Snatch\\" is superb, with all the kinetic editing techniques used in \\"Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels\\" taken to a whole new level with additional freeze-framing, fantastic slow-motion photography, and some great sound-editing that hook scenes together.  Just watch the final bare-knuckle boxing match near the end of the film if you want to see how stylish Guy Ritchie's direction can be.  This is an entertaining gangster film with great characters and inspired direction from Guy Ritchie.  This is the British equivalent to Quentin Tarantino's \\"Pulp Fiction.\\"  Highly recommended.
B0006284JQ|4.0|This CD is perfect for anyone who likes Britney but not enough to have bought any of her previous albums. It is a great \\"sampler\\" with all of her singles. Brings back memories. Now for the new material, which will be of interest to those who already own Britney's previous albums. There are two new songs and five bonus remixes. My Prerogative is a pretty good song. Not her best but enjoyable. Do Somethin' is a departure from the typical Britney sound. It took some getting used to, but now I really love it. Has a good dance vibe. Now for the remixes: The Outrageous remix is incredible. Much better than the original. Has a Middle Eastern flair. The Megamix is fun to listen to (basically a medley of Brit's most popular singles). The other three remixes are ok. They are good but nothing incredible. Overall, I'd recommend this album not only to hardcore fans but to those who like Britney but have never bought an album (or have not bought all of her albums). The packaging is also quite cool and worth a look.
0156907399|5.0|Each sentence in To the Lighthouse is so alive that, like toys at night in a haunted room, they wake up, change into strange things and go still again.  The illusion is part due to its layering and weave - dense as poetry, light as air, not a word accidental.  And part due to the structure of the novel, its great invisible solidity fixed under imagery and detail moving over it like transparent veils.  Its parts are elemental: water, air, sunlight, seaweed - frilled strips pinned to the attic walls, or later trailing around Cam's fingers in the water when the sails fill.  Part of the pleasure in reading To the Lighthouse is the revelation of its interlocking structure, how the macro-structure of the novel is reflected everywhere on the micro-scale.  An example: the three sections of the novel and their pace are seen again in the trajectory of the sailboat across the bay in the final section, where the wind takes it, then dies down, then moves again.<br /><br />The passages describing Lily Briscoe at work on her paintings seem to reflect a kind of rapture in which Woolf must have written this novel: \\"...with all her faculties in a trance, frozen over superficially but moving underneath with extreme speed.\\"  \\"It was in that moment's flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to tears...\\"  And \\"She was not inventing; she was only trying to smooth out something she had been given years ago folded up; something she had seen.\\" But some of them describe the novel itself, which has all the feel of a ghost story: \\"It was to be a thing you could ruffle with your breath; and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses.\\"<br /><br />In fact, much of the novel - like the light and dark of the lighthouse beacon, or waves crashing in and back out - works in a balanced opposition: Crowdedness and the lack of privacy juxtaposed against the condition of utter aloneness.  The bond between Mr. and Mrs. Ramsay counterbalanced with their awareness of what they've cost one another.  The collusion of the children, their secretiveness and wildness, but then their docility and vulnerability.  Trapped thoughts that can't be told, but are then understood without saying, as the same reflection - like quantum tunneling - might wind from one point of view to the mind of a different character.<br /><br />In part II the sound of bombs falling in the distance is described as \\"the measured blows of hammers on felt.\\"  There are lines like that, which come in so lightly, but their impact on landing is powerful: the novel itself explodes in your heart like a silent H-bomb.  One example is the last line in paragraph #3 in chapter XII of part 3, which I won't give away.  (And don't sneak ahead: it won't mean anything unless you've arrived there in the right order!)  And this one about James, belonging as he does to the unspecified \\"great clan\\" mentioned on page one: \\"He was so pleased that he was not going to let anyone share a grain of his pleasure.  His father had praised him.  They must think that he was perfectly indifferent.  But you've got it now, Cam thought.\\"  Many of the details in To the Lighthouse you might not even notice on first read, but when you go back they surprise you.  This is  part of the secret of the novel's geode-like quality, where you never guess what's contained inside it until you've seen the whole thing and it opens for you, then you see it.  Another Amazon reviewer was right in saying this: you have to read it twice.<br /><br />Although a short novel, To the Lighthouse contains so many themes: vision and seeing, nature at odds with human life, time and its nonlinear movement, community and individual isolation.  It's about what Mr. Ramsay knew: how \\"...our brightest hopes are extinguished, our frail barks founder in darkness\\" and what James knew: \\"That loneliness which for both of them was the truth about things.\\"  It's about things you want, and do or do not get: whether you want to go to the lighthouse, or whether you don't want to go; whether anyone will get to Sorley, the lighthouse keeper, with tobacco and newspapers, or whether he'll remain isolated out there; whether Lily will capture what she sees on her canvas; whether Paul Rayley will find Minta's lost brooch.  What Mrs. Ramsay wished for was the impossible.  It was guessed by Lily Briscoe: \\"Life stand still here.\\"ther you want to go to the lighthouse, or whether you don't want to go; whether anyone will get to Sorley, the lighthouse keeper, with tobacco and newspapers, or whether he'll remain isolated out there; whether Lily will capture what she sees on her canvas; whether Paul Rayley will find Minta's lost brooch.  What Mrs. Ramsay wished for was the impossible.  It was guessed by Lily Briscoe: \\"Life stand still here.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0002S94OS|4.0|Alright you all, I'm an older (30) reviewer and my taste in music has changed a lot in the last 10 years but if I was 20, I would have this cd in turned up full blast. Most of these newer bands I hear about through my younger cousin. He turned me into a fan of Shadow's Fall so he thought he would give Lamb of God a shot with me. What I will say is that if you like lyrics then this cd is not for you. I have no idea what the guy is saying. It is sort of a bad attempt at death metal growl. I was very much into death metal as a teenager, Obituary, Death, etc.. and these guys remind me of Obituary. Their musical ability is really high. It's great to see these young bands sounding so technical. My favorite band is Rush, who are the most technical band ever but I can find some technical talent in this cd. It is a lot better then Limp Bizkit and the other rap-metal bands. Just like with the Shadow's Fall cd I recommend this cd. Very heavy guitar and bass and pretty impressive drumming. A solid purchase.
B00005ATQ9|4.0|Slow as molasses in January, and as sweet, while the camera lingers, soulfully kissing and savoring each moment. With immaculate precision of detail, Kubrick constructs his story of the hapless rogue Lyndon, portrayed by that expert at haplessness, Ryan O'Neal. Being no heavyweight in the acting department (but being cute enough to not have to be), the lengthy script about the rogue's success has been tailored in such a way that it flatters O'Neal's meager abilities. By method of Michael Hordem's sonorous narration, much of what O'Neal has to do is look handsome in his 18th century wardrobe. And that he does. The same is virtually true of co-star Marisa Berenson, who also co-starred in *Cabaret*. She is not an incredibly gifted actress, but she is indeed, an incredibly gifted beauty. So, she, too, must rely on her attractiveness. This is a time-honored Hollywood tradition that still lives and breathes today. If they gave Oscars for being attractive (and they do, don't they, Gwyneth?), this movie would have raked in the awards. It won four, anyway - Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Costume Design and Best Musical Adaptation. Clocking in at 3 hours and 3 minutes, Kubrick fans are deeply conflicted over whether or not this is a masterpiece.
B0000029DD|4.0|Jeff Buckley's only official studio album is really a two-faced album.  One the one hand, the original songs are amazing and point towards an unfortunately unrealized bright future as a singer/songwriter.  \\"Mojo Pin\\", \\"Dream Brother\\", and especially \\"Grace\\" are three of the finest examples of their genre. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the remakes such as \\"Lilac Wine\\" and \\"Hallelujah\\" will make you think of Sam Harris singing \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" on Star Search.  With such obvious talent for writing his own songs, one wonders why he wasted time reamking these embarassing numbers. <br /> <br />As a whole, however, the album left me wondering what could've been if Jeff would've lived to complete his second solo album - one that was going to contain ALL originals.  I have listened to \\"Sketches for My Sweetheart the Drunk\\", and I think it would've been a magnificent album had it been properly completed. <br /> <br />In the end, for the ultimate Buckley CD, simply take tracks 1, 2, 3, 9, & 10 from \\"Grace\\" and augment it with some of the better tracks from \\"Sweetheart\\".  Avoid the other releases, as it seems Buckley's mom is determined to turn her deceased son into the \\"White Tupac\\"... <br /> <br />I would've probably gone with three stars on *Grace*, but the title track is so mindbogglingly amazing that it's worth a whole star by itself. <br /> <br />A solid effort - at times nearing spiritual - but the \\"cheese factor\\" knocks it down a notch.
B00005JMJG|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen in years. I bought the DVD without ever seeing the movie just because I had a feeling it was going to be good. I loved it. It's damn funny and the visuals are quite refreshing. The acting was great too.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|If you're simply going to watch the movie purely because Brad Pitt is in it,then this is your film.(I'll admitt for this film,the guy has a pretty amazing physique.It's no joke).But when you look at all the massive history regarding the Trojan War,MY GOD!you're in for a wild ride!Naturally, you have Paris who runs away with Helen to his home in Troy.There in the shore of Troy is where the war is fought between the Trojans and the Spartans.Pitt who plays Achilles,if I may say,did a great portrayal of this soldier(and it's true,there names will live on forever).The fight scene between Achilles and Hector(Eric Bana)is so awesome it literally makes you sit on the edge of your seat.If you're only paying attention to the movie just because it's fascinating then really the saying does apply \\"The rest is history\\" but woah! THERE'S SO MUCH IN THE MOVIE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO EVEN NARROW IT DOWN INTO ONE WHOLE REVIEW.And Peter O'Toole's character King Priam is magnificent(this marks his return to the big screen with fine work under his belt).Helen of Troy in this film (i dont know the actress' name) but she is beautiful!The war scenes in this film are great but i have to say that out of this whole movie the best clip has to be when King Priam(O'Toole) goes to Achilles(Pitt) to plead for his son's body is just so amazing it honestly made my mouth fall to the floor. But i have to say overall that this movie is great.The acting is magnificent. The history of this war and how it began not only is it shown in this film but really when you do learn the true history of this battle, it is something to always be remembered in history! I GIVE THIS MOVIE EVEN MORE STARS FOR ITS RICHNESS IN HISTORY FACTS AND ACTING!!! I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW ELSE TO PUT IT! JUST WATCH IT!!
B0000524EM|5.0|The Crow- the first and obviously the best edition of The Crow series.Like many people say there was no other person destinied to play the role of Eric Draven better than Brandon Lee.Great action,excitement,and sadness any dark movie could ask for.With alot of great flash back scences to show the many faces of Draven.I give it 5/5 stars. <br />The Crow:City of angels- It always makes me mad about hearing everyone dislike this movie because it didnt live up to the hype of the original crow.Its got a whole different plot to it.Im glad they didnt have each movie based around the same plot,that would pretty much make anyothers after the original seem rather one dimensional.I thought it had a lot of good things in it,show that there's different types of love and not just for the whole bf/gf. I give it 4/5 stars. <br />The Crow:Salvation- in my opinion a really good movie in its own right.I mean it had alot of different things that the others were lacking,like mystery,we didnt know til near the very end of the movie,exactly who was behide the murders.With great acting by Jodi Lyne O'Keefe among others like Kirsten Dunst and Eric Mabius.The poor man being framed for the murder of his own girlfriend,his own death wasnt in vain because he came back from the dead to find the real criminals.I give it 4.5/5 stars. <br />Like I said each movie had things about them that made them different and very well producted in their own rights.I'd say to any movie buff,these 3 you'd get your money's worth. 4.8/5 stars for the box set
B00013RC66|4.0|What ever happened to Debra Winger's career? Was it all the gossip about how difficult she was to work with? Or was she simply a victim of the public's changing tastes? Coming to prominence in 1980's *Urban Cowboy*, followed by the smash hits *An Officer and a Gentleman* and *Terms of Endearment*. Even though she was nominated for Oscars several times, it was downhill from there, but Winger was in peak form for what has been regularly described as \\"a stylish thriller.\\" Paired with Theresa Russell (a most intriguing actress with a score of bad films behind her - think *Whore*), Winger plays a federal agent on the tail of a chameleon-like young woman (Russell) who marries wealthy men and kills them. The plot is gripping and relatively fast-paced and Winger and Russell are excellent counterpoints to each other - Winger is earthy and likable and Russell is sexy and sinister. There is an interesting array of men playing Russell's victims, including Dennis Hopper in a cameo, with a deliciously calculating Diane Ladd playing his sister. The locales and interiors are suitably lush, though the inescapable hallmarks of the 80s regularly remind us that, though the film is almost 20 years old, it was done with enormous style - then and now.
B0002WYS6S|5.0|Dream Theater performance in Tokyo is one of those that you say: This is unreal.  That is the result of the arrengements on the studio after the show, or they're able to do this completely live?  I think DT and Rush are the only ones that are able to do this.  Live!!  This is, by far the best concert of DT, almost in the category of its prerunners, Rush, with Rush in Rio.  If you are a truly fan of progressive music, not necessarilly of DT, this is a must for you. You see Staind, System of a Down, Velvet Revolver and then you see DT, you went like, what's all this new rock shi$%# about?  Think about a minute.  Why do you think that almost all of the '80's groups are in stage and in the industry again? Because Alternative and New Rock could not make it better.  DT is one of those groups without era and they need to be praised for that, for the outstanding and melodic music, and for make all rock fans really happy.  Thanks J LaBrie, J Petrucci, M Portnoy, J Myung, Jordan Rudess, K Moore and Derek Sherinian. <br />
B0002234LS|2.0|Johnny Depp is a great actor, no doubt. And Stephen King has written some good scary stuff. Add the music from Philip Glass and what can go wrong?    Well, basically the problem is that this is really a quite short story that could be told in thirty minutes. And even as a short story, i's quite forgettable. (Stephen King has written some boring stuff too.)    Depp plays a slightly paranoid writer who, living in a cabin while he is getting divorced from his wife, meets a man that accuses him of plagiarism and if I tell you anything more I risk giving to much away since there aren't too many things happening in this film...    About one funny scene, never engaging or exiting - let alone scary - it's not worth you while.
B00006ADD5|5.0|To understand the Middle East as it presently exists, one must understand World War I and its consequences for those who live in the region.  In making such a study, one inevitably and repeatedly encounters the name T.E. Lawrence, then and now one of the most controversial military figures of the 20th Century, a remarkably complex man who combined an unassuming manner with an astonishing flair for self-promotion.<br /><br />Lawrence authored an account of his Arabian adventures following the war.  Titled THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM, it has the very unusual distinction of being extremely famous before it was widely available: originally printed in a limited edition of 120 copies, it was widely praised, but it was not given a further printing until after Lawrence's death--at which point both those who served with Lawrence and historians alike noted that the work was much less accurate, much less factual than its first readers supposed.  Still, between the press coverage and the man's own gift for self-mythology, it was enough.  T.E. Lawrence was enshrined in memory as Lawrence of Arabia, and in the late 1950s and early 1960s David Lean set out to make a film about him, using THE SEVEN PILLARS OF WISDOM as primary source.<br /><br />A great deal has been made of the film's factual inaccuracies; a great deal more has been made of the film's failure to explicitly portray Lawrence's covertly sadomasochistic personality and homo-erotic edge.  But LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is not a film of mere fact; we must turn to documentary for that.  It is the myth, a vision of Lawrence as he himself wished to be seen, and the covert indications of his hidden nature adds greater depth to both his character and the film as a whole: as the story progresses we become acutely aware that there is much more that we do not know, a fact that lends a tremendous sense of mystery to the film.  Factual, no; explicit, no.  But in its entirety, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA achieves an artistic truth that transcends any mere notation of fact pure and simple.<br /><br />It is, in my opinion, the single finest film of epic scope to ever reach the screen.  The episodic story, scripted by Robert Bolt (author of A MAN FOR ALL SEASONS), casts a remarkably wide net, not only following Lawrence's adventures but placing them within a finely drawn context of diplomacy as well.  The cast is superb.  Led by Peter O'Toole in the title role, virtually every actor involved not only brings the various historical figures to vivid life, but transmutes them into archetypes as well.  David Lean's direction is flawless, as is the astonishingly beautiful cinematography, artful yet unobtrusive editing, and truly memorable score.<br /><br />It is true that LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is best seen on the big screen, where its visual power may be seen a full power; even so, it fares remarkably well on the small screen, much more so than epics that rely on visual power to the exclusion of all else.  There have been several releases to the home market, including a double cassette VHS and a two disk DVD with a host of extras--but this single DVD release, a \\"no frills\\" release without significant extras, offers a near-pristine picture and excellent sound, and I recommend for those who are not greatly interested in the history of the film itself.  Mercifully, the release also preserves the film's original ratio; I flatly state that pan-and-scan versions do a tremendous disservice to both the film and the viewer.  An unedited presentation of overture, intermission, and exit music is also included to great effect.<br /><br />Alternatively languid and violent, beautiful and disquieting, LAWRENCE OF ARABIA is a remarkably fine film that deserves every praise heaped upon it since its 1962 release.  I cannot recommend it too highly.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewernds any mere notation of fact pure and simple. <br /> <br />It is, in my opinion, the single finest film of epic scope to ever reach the screen.

B00009Y3L4|5.0|\\"Divine decadence, darling,\\" is what is served up abundantly in *Cabaret*. I was in junior high school when Liza won Best Actress for her tour de force as Sally Bowles - I was furious because I felt that Diana Ross got robbed. I knew, with my consummate adolescent insight, that Liza was merely playing herself in *Cabaret*, but that Diana was acting her little heart out in *Lady Sings The Blues*. Time has told a different tale, however, with *Lady Sings The Blues* being resigned to ignominy and *Cabaret* remaining as a sparkling achievement in moviemaking. Winning 8 Academy Awards in a very tight race against such blockbusters as *The Godfather*, *Deliverance*, and *Sounder*, it is Liza Minelli's tour de force, a role of a lifetime. Even her mother, Judy Garland, never had a role like this, so exquisitely tailored to her talents, that even Liza herself had a tough time topping this performance. In fact, she never did, starring in some truly dismal choices such as *Lucky Lady* and *New York, New York*. In *Cabaret*, Minelli plays Sally Bowles, a plucky little trollop who sings at the Kit Kat club in Berlin, during the time of the Weimar Republic. Sally tries very hard to be \\"an international woman of mystery,\\" but lives in a dream world in which her non-existant worldly and dashing father will soon swoop down and rescue her. She falls in love with Brian (York), a charming and bi-sexual scholar earning his living as a translator. They are both romanced by a wealthy and handsome suitor (Griem), who after stirring their dreams and passions, leaves them flat. The subplots of Brian's students, their fellow boarders at the rooming house, and Sally's various schemes provide an opportunity for wonderful music and staging. Most of the numbers happen onstage at the Kit Kat club.  We have addressed the issue of performances within performances before - and the usual question is \\"Who would pay money to see this?\\" But in *Cabaret*, the staged musical numbers are spectacular and you would definitely pay good money to see a nightclub performances like those. \\"Money\\" and \\"Mien Herr\\" are incredible, and Bob Fosse's outre choreography is stunning. The costuming and makeup add to the heightened surrealism, and the Nazi threat adds an element of danger and desperation to a movie that would be hard to classify as a musical, drama, comedy, satire or war movie. The Nazi violence, with a few exceptions, is shown by implication and suggestion. The \\"Tomorrow Belongs To Me\\" number is roundly described as stunning and chilling, and after almost 30 years, remains so. The concept of the story itself is enduring, engendering a recent Broadway revival directed by *American Beauty*'s Sam Mendez.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This CD gets me pumped up for school. Ironic how it's titled 'the college dropout'.   Standouts: the new workout plan, family business, we don't care, all falls down, slow jamz
B00005B4GU|3.0|I must be a rare breed of human being. I listened to Kid A and didn't think it was weird. Complex, yes. But weird, no. I ended up loving it. So it only seemed natural that I listen to Amnesiac, which often bears the distinction of being Kid A's double. After all, they were recorded during the same sessions. The songs on this album, in contrast to Kid A, are split between being more out there and being more traditional. Unfortunately, in my mind this results in an album that is simultaneously too weird and yet too bland.    Well, actually it wouldn't be all too fair to describe it in so harsh of a statement. In actuality, I did enjoy many of the songs. But for the most part, I felt that it simply did not measure up to Kid A. Following is my song-by-song breakdown.    The album starts off on a good (but not great) note with Packt Like Sardines In a Crushd Tin Box. Neat electronica beats and I like the percussion, which sounds like banging on a giant metal tank. But floating over this is a rather disappointing performance by Thom Yorke, who seems to have traded in his trademark wistful whine for an expressionless drone. But following this is the excellent Pyramid Song. This song, which was made a single, starts with a simple yet rhythmically tricky piano chord progression (I love the way some notes \\"hesitate\\" and are played off-beat). As the song progresses, more layers are added, forming a swirling, beautiful melody. Then after this...well, Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors. It's very easy for some people to hate this song, and I can see how it would be too out there, but I actually like it a lot! This song is entirely techno-oriented, and I think it has a really good momentum.    After these three songs are a trio of (relatively) more traditional numbers. You and Whose Army and Knives Out wouldn't be all too out of place on OK Computer. The former sounds like the slower songs that end the album (No Surprises, Lucky, The Tourist) and features an excellent vocal performance byThom Yorke accompanied by synthesized crooners in the background. The latter, the other single from Amnesiac, features a guitar riff reminiscient of Paranoid Android in a creepy song about cannibalism (not to mention the messed-up video that went with the song). I Might Be Wrong, on the other hand, is a good synthesis of traditional rock and electronica. Kinda like a more upbeat version of In Limbo from Kid A.    Following Morning Bell/Amnesiac, a wonderfully spine-tingling revamp of the song of same name from Kid A, comes what in my mind is the low point of the album. These next three songs I simply can't bring myself to like. Dollars and Cents starts off promising with a nice guitar riff, but soon gets buried in a mess of synthesizer notes. As for Hunting Bears, this nothing song sounds like Johnny Greenwood was just warming up his guitar. Then comes Like Spinning Plates. This song, which is about as out there as the aforementioned Pulk/Pull Revolving Doors I can only describe as, well, interesting. You know those colorful plastic tubes that you can swing in a circle to make whistling noises? Imagine a whole song filled with those noises and you have Like Spinning Plates. Despite these weak songs, the album finishes strongly with Life In a Glasshouse. Piano, clarinet, trombone, and trumpet accompany Thom Yorke in a song that sounds like something you would hear in some old film noir.    In the end, you'll notice that with the exception of three songs, I wasn't all that harsh towards this album. Nevertheless, while many of the songs are quite good, the album simply isn't as stunning overall as Kid A. As a result, I'm left with the impression that all the best songs from the Kid A/Amnesiac session were already culled out, leaving this fairly mediocre effort.
0385510454|1.0|This book was a huge disappointment.  It seems that Grisham was bit by the same bug as Pat Conroy in Beach Music.  That is, a wildly succesful author spends time in Italy and then feels compelled to build a novel around a travelog.  Although the Broker wet my appetite for a trip to Italy, the book was flat-out bad.  We are supposed to believe that a low-life white collar criminal finds redemption by spending two months in Italy?  Then, as the book builds towards a climax, it simply stops.  Although there are some good \\"action scenes,\\" I was left wondering about the outcome and effect of the protagonist's last actions.  Grisham would have never obtained the popularity that he enjoys today had this novel been among Grisham's first.
0790729377|5.0|\\"I've always depended on the kindness of strangers,\\" is a very difficult line to read convincingly. Recent years have brought us a plethora of *Blanches DuBois*. Just ask Jessica Lange or Ann-Margaret how hard that line is to read - neither of them came close to convincing us of it. But Vivien Leigh - the ethereally lovely and vastly skilled actress who brought us the immortal Scarlett O'Hara - utters the line in such a way that makes the heart ache. Leigh, who won Best Actress for her performance, plays the seminal Blanche. She is flighty, unstable and riddled with neuroses, and the very apex of Tennessee Williams' dysfunctional but immense creativity. Her character is strongly contrasted by that of Marlon Brando's crude, Neanderthal-like Stanley Kowalski, and both of them, perhaps because of their personal parallels to their characters, excel at these playing parts. This re-release restored several minutes of sexual tension to the film that had been hacked out by the censors, notably filling out Kim Hunter's Oscar-winning role as Blanche's beloved sister, Stella. Despite the stifling mores of the Fifties, the film also garnered awards for Karl Malden, and Best Art Direction.

B00005JN4O|5.0|Johnny Depp plays James Berrie, a playwright who is dealing with an unstable career and a strained marriage.  While writing in the park one day, he befriends Sylvia, a young widow (Kate Winslet), and her four boys. As he begins spending time with the Davies family, James is finally allowed to let his imagination take off, and he is inspired to write the play \\"Peter Pan.\\"<br /><br />This is much more than a story about \\"Peter Pan\\" itself.  The film focuses on the relationships that James develops with the Berrie children, especially young Peter (played by the adorable Freddie Highmore).  Although his bond with the Davies family is exactly what James needs to get his creative juices flowing, his already strained relationship with his wife Mary (Radha Mitchell) suffers even more because of it.  There is also the issue of Sylvia's mother (Julie Christie), who disapproves with James' relationship with her daughter because she fears it will ruin any chance Sylvia has of remarrying.<br /><br />The cast of \\"Finding Neverland\\" is excellent.  Depp and Winslet deliver exceptional performances as always, and I was especially impressed by the talent of the four young boys in the film.  They all have very promising careers ahead of them.<br /><br />I think everyone will enjoy this movie.  It's magical and a tad bitersweet, and I left the theatre wanting to learn more about the real James Berrie, as this film is based on his real life.
B00005JN4O|5.0|Johnny Depp, dead cert for Oscar nomination of 2005, plays J. M. Barrie, the creator of Peter Pan.  'Finding Neverland' is largely based on the real-life events surrounding the man and the four boys and a widow who inspired the writer to give birth to one of the world's most beloved character, and how the friendship between them gave the magical inspiration to the writer.  And the film has that magical quality too.  <br /> <br />After the critical disaster of the stage production (which was also a financial disaster to his patron Charles Frohman played by Dustin Hoffman) J. M. Barrie meets the boys and their mother in the park while walking his dog.  The widowed lady is Sylvia Davies (equally superb Kate Winslet), to whom Barrie is attracted despite the existence of his neglected wife Mary (Radha Mitchell).  In this curious but still interesting way, the magical creation of Peter Pan started.  <br /> <br />While Barrie comes to be an unofficial member of Sylvia's family, we realize that there is too much innocence on the side of Barrie, who can see that imagination is a great thing when playing with the kids yelling like pirates in the garden, but who cannot see that he (and Sylvia) is violating the social mores of English middle-class.  Nor can he understand the broken heart of his own wife.     <br /> <br />The film takes great liberty with the biographical facts, so don't believe that eveything depicted here is historically accurate.  The story is too neat, with the events compressed within 100 minutes.  And some characters -- such as Ian Hart as Conan Doyle or Julie Christie as Mrs. Emma DuMaurier -- should be given more substantial or complex roles. <br /> <br />But Johhny Depp gives accomplished portrait as Barrie who refused to see certain things in life, and created the character who refuses to grow up, with very warm and tender touch.  Frankly, I find his Scottish accent slightly annoying, and Barrie's naivete that could be more harmful to the Sylvia's family is toned down to make his personality and the film itself more accessable.  He loves Sylvia, it is certain, but not in the way that reminds you of the idea of infidelty.   <br /> <br />However, the fine acting from Depp and Winslet overcomes these  strangely vague points, which could be fatally damaging in the hands of other lesser actors.  As it is, the film remains very engaging throughout, as the heart-felt portraits of the people who needed each other to survive the pains that life can give.
B000000I0G|5.0|Reading a lot of reviews about Tubular Bells being the highest score in Oldfield`s career, makes me a lot disagree. Perhaps after the also excellent and refined Tubular Bells 2, Oldfield`s material became rather modern stuff, shaped to suite todays sounds, which made his recent records a bit less adventorous than the previous ones.  <br />FIVE MILES OUT, is my favourite album. The 25 minute Taurus II is of epic proportions. Played loud in a capable hi-fi system will leave you breathless, and leaving you think that you`ve just heard to the best pieces of music one might ever hear. Taurus II, is perhaps the reply to those who say that Mike`s efforts in improving his work over Tubular Bells has been in vain. The progressive and varying rock theme is simply stunning and unique.  <br />Orabidoo, is also another unique material, making (together with Taurus II) FIVE MILES OUT a unique material even in Mike discography. Mount Teidi offers some refined timpani work, while pop sound is exploited in Family Man and in the title track. <br />This is an album which one must buy without hesitation! Simply outstanding!!
B00064MW6A|4.0|I didn't have a chance to see this movie when it came out in theaters but didn't think I missed out on much because most said this was a horrible film. After seeing it, I'm not sure what all the complaints and talk were about. This isn't Oscar worthy or cutting edge like one of the 80s \\"Superman\\" flims but it is not as bad as, say, \\"The Hulk.\\"<br /><br />First, this isn't based on the Catwoman that appears in the \\"Batman\\" series. It's based on the character as she is seen in the independent series. It doesn't take place in Gotham, it doesn't rely on any nods or ties to \\"Batman\\" and that comic book series. Perhaps that makes it hard for people to accept.<br /><br />The movie starts off a bit slow. You aren't confronted with action and her big transformation until a little bit into the movie. The movie takes the time to establish who this character is; where she came from, the problems she faces in her ordinary life, what leads to her transformation. Then, unlike many comic book genre movies, it seems to try to be more realistic and base Catwoman in historic terms. These parts are a little slow and dragging, but they are essential. There are some interesting things established that sets \\"Catwoman\\" apart from other films like it. There is a nod to the \\"Batman\\" franchise; you can see a photo of Michelle P.'s Catwoman from \\"Batman Returns.\\"<br /><br />There are some rather cheesey script moments but it doesn't take away from the story all that much. Berry really got into the role of \\"Catwoman.\\" She seemed to struggle in the early scenes before she's undergone her transformation but it doesn't take much time for her to put a spin on the Catwoman role. There are some parts in the film where you can see some unscripted moments; parts where she is fully into the mind-set of this character that isn't restrained and doesn't know where her place is in the world. The parts where she did her own stunts (you can watch these in the special features) makes the film even better. The computer generated Catwoman isn't great (you can tell this isn't close to being a real person) but it is not as bad as the computer generated Hulk from a few years back.<br /><br />The supporting actors like Benjamin B., Sharon Stone, and Berry's friend in her office are all at the top of their game. The story may be predictable in some parts, but there are many unexpected moments and scenes that are all very interesting and worthy of a little praise.<br /><br />This is not an award-winner but it is far from the worse film ever made. I think people came into this expecting another \\"Monster's Ball\\" performance but hey, it's \\"Catwoman.\\" It is meant to be a little fun, a little comic-booky and quite different from most films. There's action and some really amusing scenes. Berry obviously invested herself into this film and adds a little range to her character. This is in no way a continuation of the character that appeared in \\"Batman Returns\\" but the film does a good job in creating and establishing a unique and original Cat-woman. The main conflict is something a bit different as well; Catwoman takes on a woman in her 40s who (like many in Hollywood) is facing the end of her career due to her age.<br /><br />This is a film worth watching and is far from being as bad as some of these reviewers have said it to be. Come on, not every film is going to be Academy Award winning and it shouldn't be held up to high standards just because the leading actress in it won an Oscar for a previous film.

B00068IOWC|3.0|In the years prcedeing the release, I recall Bono and Edge saying the forthcoming album was going to be more rock based.  Maybe their hardest work yet.  I wasn't expecting Megadeth hard, but some material to show off Edge's guitar chops.  We all know Bono is a great lyricist and singer, but Edge is a guitar champ, he just doesn't get the credit.  You can see this by listening to \\"Achtung Baby\\" and some of the cuts from \\"ATYCLB\\", songs that got you pupmed up like they did back in the '80s.   <br />Not to say that this is a bad album, nothing U2 does is ever bad, it's just not what I was expecting.  With the exceptions of Vertigo, Miracle Drug, and Yaweh, the album crawls along.  Nothing really makes me stop and say \\"Wow!\\".  The rest seems more like B-sides, sorry but it does.   <br />You would think that after so many awards and the Elevation tour, wo would see more songs to test out your speakers.  Songs like New York from \\"ATYCLB\\", where you absolutely have to listen to it as loud as possible.  I love 'em but I expected more.
B00007ELEL|4.0|This is another one of those movies where I could sit here and describe the plot and characters in exact detail for several paragraphs, but it wouldn't matter worth a damn anyway.

It pushes the bounds of postmodern filmmaking (read: absence of any solid plot) to a great degree. A cowboy narrator, avant-garde hipsters, German nihilists, bowling, '60s music, amputed toes, killer ferrets, TONS of f-bombs, sex, and acid flashbacks are all involved.<br /><br />Is it ABOUT anything?

En cuanto a los temas en estudio, Love Comes Tumbling es una de las rarsimas canciones de U2 que suenan ochenteras, anticuadas y aburridas. The Tree Sunrises sin embargo es genial.
B00064AM6C|5.0|I was in awe the entire time. The White Stripes are just back to basic music, and Jack White plays the guitar as if he is possessed. Meg White is a solid drummer - a perfect complement to the guitar wailings of Jack. That's it folks, two musicians who make more music than larger bands.<br /><br />The energy is astounding. The audio recording is beautiful. The visuals are intentionally grainy, but I find it enhances the experience. Overall, the package is very well done. There are no frills. You put the DVD in and the concert begins.<br /><br />Lover's of music will not be disappointed. I believe Jimi Hendrix would have been impressed.
B0002OERI0|1.0|What a fake sounding album from Green Day, they've blown it. <br /> <br />Does anyone even know what punk rock is anymore. <br /> <br />If not then check out \\"Insomniac\\"
B0001UL7RY|1.0|You Avril fans must be the stupidest people on Earth.  You all think Avril is incredibly talented.  WHY??? <br /> <br />Do you really think it takes talent to screech into a microphone?  Because thats all Avril does.  Get any other teenage girl to screech into a microphone, and it would sound pretty much the same.  It requires talent to sing, but angry yelling can be done by anyone. <br /> <br />You Avril fans need to stop being so narrow minded and bigoted.  There's more to life than just anger rock.
B000001DTM|5.0|Achtung Baby es una genialidad, es un descubrimiento, es una experiencia, es una valoracin de la bsqueda, del inconformismo, de la creacin musical. <br /> <br />Desde la portada se vea una renovacin completa - Un U2 con look distinto, moderno, adelantado incluso a su poca. El album arranca con Zoo Station, una muestra extraordinaria de lo se vena. Una cancin que rompa con todos los esquemas musicales de U2, con un sonido mucho ms elaborado, ms electrnico y moderno. La voz de Bono sonaba radicalmente diferente de los 80. Todo ello haca ser una delicia para los que esperbamos algo realmente nuevo e inspirador. <br /> <br />Even Better Than The Real Thing iva tan lejos como Zoo Station, ya dejndonos bien en claro que el U2 de los 80 haba desaparecido...para mejor ( que diferencia con el vendido U2 2000 ! ). La entrada de One nos acercaba ms a este disco urbano y provocador, identificndonos ya plenamente con esos sonidos y momentos tan propios de nuestra vida urbana. Hasta la fecha - y dudo que lo hagan - U2 no han podido superar el impacto de esta cancin, slo igualada un ao y medio ms tarde con Stay. <br /> <br />The Edge nos deleitaba al mximo con confusos y nuevos sonidos, como en la introduccin de Until The End Of The World. U2 se atrevan a saturar al mximo las guitarras, y mezclarlas sorprendentemente con cellos, como ocurre en Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses. El \\"lado A\\" del disco termina con So Cruel, donde una percusin matizada electrnicamente y un piano guan el tema, adems de un bajo de Adam que da profundidad sonora. <br /> <br />El \\"lado B\\" comienza de una manera salvaje, con The Fly, que ejemplifica la personalidad de este - entonces - nuevo U2. Una cancin arrolladora, con una meloda magnfica y potente. Seguido de ella est Misteryous Ways, donde las percusiones se adentran en terrenos medio-orientales, recargando la originalidad y ruptura musical de U2. Tryin' To Throw Your Arms Around The World es quizs el punto ms bajo del album, sin ser aburrida, no est a la altura del resto. Ultraviolet es genial, con una comunicacin extraordinaria entre la seccin rtmica y The Edge, quien adems hace unos coros fenomenales. <br /> <br />El disco termina con dos joyas musicales: Acrobat - cancin que incomprensiblemente U2 ( a la fecha ) jams han tocado en vivo - y Love Is Blindness. Esta ltima una hermosura oscura y reveladora, donde el rgano otorga un sonido magistral. <br /> <br />A diferencia de lo que dicen defensores intiles de How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb - que se excusan en que hay que darle tiempo al disco, al igual que lo que sucedi con Achtung Baby - este album es completamente innovador, rupturista, una genialidad pura, a aos luz de este U2 opaco, viejo, moribundo y sin ideas musicales.
B00005JMYI|1.0|It's kinda wierd to make a whole other  movie from the outtakes of a bad film. It is even stranger that the movie made up of those outtakes is a better film than the original. Such is the case here. They should have released Wake Up Ron Burgandy as the theatrical version. Much funnier than Anchorman itself. Not that this is saying much however. Anybody else agree with me on this one?
B000669GAI|3.0|I don't think Pearl Jam actually got a say in the tracklist, as it was in their contract to release a \\"BEST OFF.\\" So it was most likelys SONYS COLLECTION OF SINGLES. <br /> <br />Its the music that matters, not the popularity of song. <br /> <br />When music (in the boring, safe, and disgusting state that it is in at the moment) burns itself out, more people will realise what real music is actually about. After all Pearl Jam are'nt a mainstream or commerical band these days. <br /> <br />Heres my take on it. A mixed tracklist as well. <br /> <br />1. (A new song would of been nice) <br />2.

037542217X|5.0|I found this book the second best book in the series of the Number 1 Lady's Dectective Agency. It is quaint and touching. It deals with modern issues solved with age old respect and dignity.

Son 16 canciones, algunas de las cuales S deben estar ah ( One, Stay, Even Better Than The Real Thing, Mysterious Ways, etc ) pero otras simplemente slo ocupan espacio y estn de ms ( Electrical Storm, The Hands That Built America - que aburrimiento de cancin, otro clich de U2 para homenajear a su Estados Unidos - The First Time, Until The End Of The World, y todos los \\"new mix\\" ).

B000005Z0G|5.0|\\"My faverit songZ by tupack are Gansters paradis wich was featured in the movie Dangris Minds. Also I like the song California Love. I love it when he's like :\\"everybody welcome to the wild wild west\\" because that happenes to be my favorite will smith movie! The favorite tupack record is the ARE YOU STILL DOWN, but i have the edited version because my dum parents disaprove but uyou still know whats hesayin. I am from a white uper class naebor hood by i still understrand tus lyrics because i can relate with his issues i havent got everything i want when im a kid like he didnt get. but i feel connected with his words because he talks about how hje likes to be high and my dad is a pilot and we fly in his plane a lot and we have a good time. Tupack talks alot how he liked to be really high in his plane. His music has inspired me to dop the best i can in school. I like tupacks thuglife tatto because my grandpa has an anchor tattoees on his arm and i like tatoos.We are allsorry that tupack was shot after leaving a party with his manager puff diddy, but his legend lives on. He will live in all our hearts forever,. My other favoruite song by tu is the new one made by M&M called 'RUNNING' featuring nortoris big, it is about how when pack was young he was in track and i run track so we also have that in commun. I dont like nortoris big as much because his rcord label (Aftermath records) was behind the release of the wu tang clan which i dont like because they have satanic refrecnes. But i really like this tupack cd and thats why i gave it the #1 star!\\" <br /> <br /> <br />Can this guy be anymore ignorant? 1 star because he likes it so much? Should be 5 stars if thats the case. Damn 12 year olds <br /> <br />This is one of 2pacs greatest CD besides Me Against the World. Favorite song: Keep Ya Head Up
B0006399FS|1.0|\\"A real rock n roll record\\" Bono<br /><br />\\"The best U2 record ever\\" Some who heard it before hand.<br /><br />\\"We've been waiting 25 years to make this record\\" Bono<br /><br />Right well, if it was then all I can say you need to be a bit more interesting U2 if your gonna call this your best.<br /><br />Bono said that this album is their best before it was released, then after 2 weeks he said.<br /><br />\\"Its the second best after Actung Baby\\"<br /><br />Before you know it, Bono will be admitting that even \\"POP\\"<br /><br />(Their most impressive and amazing album, and rocking album although a commercial disastor - thanking god\\")<br /><br /> is better than this.<br /><br />I don't know why they dislike the direction they had in that album, it was amazing and their image was bad and cooler than ever before during that time.<br /><br />Pop, (Stay Faraway...., Lemon, Numb)from Zooporopa, Actung Baby, The Joshua Tree, and their earliear work just p*sses all over their last two albums.<br /><br />That of course is because they are both fake commercial albums, and if you ask me, music today all sounds fake and safe and boring and this album is no exception.<br /><br />If U2 had done what they promised.<br /><br />\\"Made a record that was real rock n roll and updated their sound, they would of come out with one of their best albums ever.<br /><br />Flippin heak, even if the songs were'nt as good as previous ones, the guitars would of made up for it.<br /><br />Thats not to say that this album does'nt have its good moments, although very few, afterall it is U2.<br /><br />Original of the species is a pretty good track, although dropping Bonos<br /><br />\\"Do dodododododdoodo, sugar c'mon!\\" stupid line would of helped.<br /><br />Yahweh is a nice way to finish the album of, and should of stayed on the album.<br /><br />All Because of You is pretty good and is a nice guitar driven song. See what difference an electic guitar makes rather than a stupid keyboard or an easy on theear sounding build of a chorus.<br /><br />Miracle Drug is good, the best on the album, although the lyrics are terrible when you think about it.<br /><br />\\"Freedom has the scent, like the top of a new born babies head?\\"<br /><br />sounds f$%^** bonkers to me!<br /><br />Musically this album is boring, and the songs is what keeps fans of \\"songs\\" happy, but the sound of the actual music, not just the song, is what makes a great album and tune.<br /><br />I think U2 should of learnt that by now.<br /><br />Bono looked cooler when he did'nt always have to wear shades all the time, and his riduclous long hair.
B00005AR3G|5.0|This has got to be our family's favorite new Disney picture. My husband, a working bass player, plays the theme song over and over. My 5-year-old laughs so hard she gets hiccups, which makes it funnier for us, her parents, because we know she isn't getting half of the jokes. And this cast, it is just perfect for this movie. I have lent this movie out to people who have never heard about it and they cannot believe they never heard of it. The artwork is lush, the characters are out of this world, and, believe it or not, the lesson sinks in. True definition of a sleeper. See for yourself.
B000001FRY|5.0|<br />Boy es extrao, quizs por eso mismo es que es tan fascinante. Tiene un sonido nico, que jams U2 volvi a repetir. Se combinan guitarras inexplicablemente secas y agresivas - que me sorprenden -, una batera directa y slida, una voz de Bono poderosa y genial, unas canciones cristalinas y sucias a la vez, etc. <br /> <br />Este disco es sin duda, el ms \\"punk\\" de toda la historia de U2, irrepetible. Por ello no creas - y de verdad te lo advierto - que esta banda iPod que usan el nombre de U2 estn de vuelta a aquella crudeza y desnudez musical de hace 25 aos. <br /> <br />La Primera cancin de Boy es I Will Follow, un tema que nos sorprende por la gran separacin con la escena musical de aquellos aos. Twilight es desgarradoramente hipntica, en especial por aquellas guitarras de un jovenssimo The Edge - de apenas 19 aos en 1980 -. <br /> <br />An Cat Dubh es uno de los temas mas misteriosos y cautivantes de U2, seguido por un intermedio musical muy efectivo llamado Into The Heart. Es la nica vez en la historia de U2 en que encontramos canciones cantadas de menos de 2 minutos de duracin, infludos quizs por The Wall de Pink Floyd. <br /> <br />Out Of Control - el primer single de la banda - resume toda aquella descollante energa juvenil puesta en este album. Stories Of Boys es igualmente sorprendente. The Ocean es otra cancin corta ( como Into The Heart ), pero necesaria. A Day Without Me es una genialidad, amo esa cancin. El punto ms bajo es Another Time Another Place, sin dejar de ser buena, pero ello se compensa con el mejor tema del album, The Electric Co. El disco lo cierra un tema distinto al resto del album, con un sonido ms experimental y que excursiona en otros terrenos. Shadows and Tall Trees. <br /> <br />La produccin fue sencillamente genial, de un hombre que gracias a este disco despus trabaj con artistas como Peter Gabriel. Un acierto de debut, muy recomendable y sorprendente, sobre todo si piensas que U2 empez con Pride ( in the name of love ) el ao 1984.
B00002Z88D|5.0|What can i say...i got in to metallica about 4 years ago and when i heard this one i couldnt believe it! This album was in my cd player for at least a month straight. It was pure genius combining one of the greatest metal bands about with the san francisco symphony, it gives the songs more depth and more feeling, and to put the icing on top it was preformed live! It features all of thier greatist hits including: master of puppets, for whom the bell tolls, enter sandman and sad but true just to name a few, so in a way its also like a greatest hits album...but sooo much greater. For all of you metallica fans this is a must have!!!!! 5 out of 5
B00028HBKC|4.0|i loved this movie.its probably of the most dramatic movies of all time.the acting was cool i didnt like the fact that it didnt show all of jesus's life and the bread and fish in the baskets or i couldnt understand them without subtitles.or there werent any special features like mel gibson showing how he did the film,not the bloody parts but just the film,or no deleted scenes.i would be happier if mel put this on 2-disc later on this year sometime
B000001FS3|5.0|<br />En una era de U2 en la cual no exista internet, no existan muchos video clips, en donde no se inventaban historias ni se hacan falsas promesas, estos - entonces - 4 jvenes de Irlanda conquistaron el mundo, a base de todo lo contrario que son hoy en da. Eran una banda honesta, fuerte, decidida a luchar por la igualdad de derechos, de oportunidades, que peleaban por los ms pobres, que no robaban dinero a sus fans, que decan SLO la verdad, etc. <br /> <br />U2 haban llamado mundialmente la atencin desde su album War, en 1983. Eran los aos de la bandera blanca. Luego cambiaron radicalmente - que diferencia con lo que son ahora - su sonido con Unforgettable Fire, en 1984, y realizaron una gira que se coron con la mtica actuacin en el Wembley Stadium el 13 de Julio de 1985, rindiendo la ms salvaje y bella versin de Bad que jams hayan realizado hasta el da de hoy. Luego de un Ep el mismo ao, prcticamente desaparecieron del mapa, y slo se supo de ellos a mediados de 1986 cuando junto a artistas como The Police, Peter Gabriel y otros realizaron la gira de Amnesty International durante un mes por Estados Unidos. Despus de ello, Bono y su esposa se fueron a Amrica Central, donde surgieron muchas temticas para su prximo album, como Bullet The Blue Sky y Mothers Of The Dissapeared. <br /> <br /> que distintos eran aquellos tiempos, en los cuales U2 s eran un clsico . De la noche a la maana sacaron su disco The Joshua Tree, en Marzo de 1987. Ello ya marca un acontecimiento y una gran diferencia con estos seores iPod de hoy en da: se atrevieron a lanzar un LP en Marzo, cuando todos saben que es mejor lanzarlo en Octubre o Noviembre ( como sus albumes All That You Can't Leave Behind o su fallida \\"Bomba\\" ) ya que en vsperas de navidad las ventas aumentan sustancialmente. <br /> <br />U2 soprenda alcanzando un rcord indito en los 80: alcanzar disco de platino a ambos lados del Atlntico a las 48 horas de haber sido puesto a la venta ( How ToDismantle An Atomic Bomb recin el 16 de Diciembre logr el milln de copias en el Reino Unido, mientras que este disco hizo lo mismo en dos das... y sin esa mquina de promocin ). <br /> <br />Este disco es una pieza de arte en la historia de U2, sorprendentemente rico musical y lricamente. Contiene fragmentos de incalculable valor como sus 5 primeras canciones, One Tree Hill, In God's Country o Mothers Of The Dissapeared. Bono S tena una gran voz para cantar, adems de los pasajes musicales - entonces originales y sorprendentes - de The Edge ( ahora agotado creativamente ). La produccin en esos aos era mil veces mejor que la que han hecho desde el ao 2000.  <br /> <br />Este disco es uno de esos que hay que escucharlos en forma completa, ya que te atrapa y te hace ser un soundtrack de tu propia vida. Inolvidable, elocuente, magnfico. U2 cuando saban ser U2.
B00005JN0T|4.0|When I first saw this movie in cinema, I thought it was o.k.  Now, I've seen it again on DvD, and enjoyed it even more than I did back then, in August 2004.     The movie takes place in the year 2035, which is pretty hard to believe, seeing that is the world in 30 years. (very Scfi)  But it doesn't matter that much, does it? :)  But this movie is pure fun: It has great caracters, great action, great humor and... Will Smitt.  He's perfect for the rol of the \\"anti-robot-cop\\" Dell Spooner, and plays his part with great humor, and great acting.  Bridget Moynahan also plays a great part as the beautiful doctor Calvin.     The action and the special effects in this movie are superb, great fun to watch. Like the cool car scene, and the endbattle are great.     It's also a very good story, that gives another look at the future and another look at robots.     Defenitly a must-see.
630469797X|5.0|Dawn of the Dead is by far the best horror movie and the BEST movie of all time with bloody special effects and better zombies than Romero's NOTLD. A virus causes zombies to eat human brains and then a SWAT team shoots zombies in an apartment and then a couple of survivors hide in a mall and keep the zombies out and then the fun starts when the zombies get killed. Tom Savini did a good job on the gore effects and the zombies makeup. The Unrated Director's cut is longer and better showing more gore and gruesome effects. Classic scenes include a zombie getting his head blown off in fast-motion and a zombie getting a machete in his head. The remake was mediocre but dosen't have a chance beating this one. A+
B00000DFSK|4.0|Un gran Best Of para una gran dcada ( la mejor de U2 en mi opinin ). No obstante comparto la opinin de un fan, que podran haber includo un par de canciones ms. No entiendo por qu los best of ( desde la dcada de los 90 empez esta moda, creo ) TIENEN que tener un tema nuevo  para qu ? si nadie conoca esa cancin nueva, adems que quita espacio a alguna que s podra haber sido includa. Sin embargo, eso no quita que este Best Of sea bueno y sobre todo necesario para los fans que empiezan a conocer U2 o que no vivieron esa poca de los 80. <br />Este hubiese sido el Best Of perfecto: <br /> <br />1- I will Follow <br />2- Gloria <br />3- Sunday Bloody Sunday <br />4- New Year's Day <br />5- Pride ( in the name of love ) <br />6- The Unforgettable Fire <br />7- Bad <br />8- Bullet The Blue Sky <br />9- Running To Stand Still <br />10-Where The Streets Have No Name <br />11-I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For <br />12-With Or Without You <br />13-Desire <br />14-When Love Comes To Town <br />15-Angel Of Harlem <br />16-All I Want Is You
0790736039|3.0|Just like Pet Sematary this movie is well made but too long and gets a little boring here and there. A group of kids have trouble with a supernatural force that's a clown and then grow up with the supernatural spirit that follows them. The second half is a bunch of grown-ups having flashbacks and the firsthalf is a kids point of view. Not really the best nor worst Stephen King adaption to movie but could have worked better if it weren't so long. A good cast features John Ritter,Annette O'Toole,Tim Reid,Harry Anderson,Richard Masur,Dennis Christopher,and Richard Thomas as well as Tim Curry as the It clown named Pennywise. The best parts are when the clown pops up in the shower and scares the kid and when the girl sees a balloon in her sink and pops releasing blood. Watch to watch on TV(sci/fi channel and USA) show it all the time but do not buy unless you have a Stephen King book and movie collection.
0140177396|5.0|George's mentally challenged companion liked to pet soft things.  Lennie's failure to understand social mores drove the couple away from good jobs.  Their dream was to get a stake to have a place of their own and for Lennie to have rabbits to tend. <br /> <br />They meet Curley, Curley's wife, the old man,and the boss at the new place.  George explains to one of the hands, Slim, that he used to be mean to Lennie but he can't do that anymore. Lennie is a good worker.  The trouble starts when Curley's wife screams and Lennie becomes afraid.  With her death dreams of betterment evaporate.   <br /> <br />There are touches of magical realism.  Steinback was a worthy successor of Jack London in terms of philosophical bent.
B00005R1N3|3.0|Frightening in a few parts but the ending was a huge dissapointment. The killer's identity is never revealed nor is it explained what was the motive behind the senseless killings. Who was this obscene phone caller/Killer? What is his background and why did he choose to invade and murder the women at the sorority home? In the films \\"Friday the 13TH\\" and \\"Halloween\\" we knew the motive behind Mrs. Voorhees' and Michael Myers' murder spree, but in this film...it is left unexplained. Why?
B0001CCXZW|5.0|It's said that certain shows sometimes take half a season or so to \\"warm up\\" before they really take off--not the case with \\"Gilmore Girls\\"--the show established itself immediately and the whole first season remains continually addictive episode after episode.  The chemistry between Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel is uncanny and overwhelmingly convincing and endlessly entertaining.  The show does a great job of slipping in \\"side stories\\" for additional interest while keeping the focus primarily on the endeavors of Lorelai and Rory.  Essentially, all of the show's acting is excellent, including Scott Patterson's masterful portrayal of the Luke character, but it's Alexis Bledel who 'steals the show' again and again--granted, she's at an advantage in the sense that she's playing such a likeable character in the first place, however, she truly brings the Rory character to life in such a one-of-a-kind way that's pure genius.  Obviously a lot has already been said about \\"Gilmore Girls\\" and certainly no one in the right mind can deny it's a terrific show.  I'd just like to add that there's a wonderfully uplifting and human quality about \\"Gilmore Girls\\"--to put it a certain way, it makes you realize that certain things that can happen in life are really not as catastrophic as they may appear.  \\"Gilmore Girls\\" serves as a reminder of the joyfulness that life can provide, as well as the importance of really learning from life's experiences.  Plus, there is some GREAT and intelligent humor in here that totally hits the spot, plus fun references to history, music, and more.  This 6 DVD set is excellently packaged and contains generous bonus material--add to this the consistent high quality of the show itself, this set easily justifies its price.  If you've never really watched \\"Gilmore Girls\\" much, or if you've missed a lot of episodes, this is an ideal way to start getting caught up, and where better to start than the beginning!
6305910340|5.0|The worst thing about this movie is that it appears to be about chess.  This is bad only because it might keep people from watching one of the most heart-warming and engrossing movies out there.  And that's a rare combination of qualities to find an a movie. <br /> <br />First, the basic story involves a father dealing with the fact that his son is a prodigy.  And learning that it takes almost as much for the parents to deal with that as the child.  In Canada, this manifests itself in hockey parents who attempt to choke coaches.  In the U.S., it's more likely found in the small town passions surrounding high school sports.  But the feeling is very universal.  Over the course of the move, the father learns how to deal with childhood genius from, of all people, the son. <br /> <br />The engrossing part of the movie comes, unexpectantly, from the chess.  Even if you have never played the game before, the pacing, cinematography and editing of the chess scenes add a tension that rivals many great sports movies (ignoring the 'chess is not a sport argument').  My wife, a person who knows little about the game, also lists this among the movies that we have no problems watching again and again.  And honestly, that is the mark of a great movie.
B0002858YS|5.0|The Killers' Debut effort 'Hot Fuss' proves to be an album to be excited about. Their 80's synths only sharpen the rocky edginess about them, it honestly innovates their music. Their forte seems to be tracks like 'Somebody Told Me', 'Jenny was a friend of mine', 'Mr. Brightside', 'Change your mind', 'On Top', 'Midnight Show' which are all fast-paced rock-driven songs. They slow things down just abit on tracks like 'Smile like you mean it', 'All these things that i've done'(which even features a choir), 'Andy, you're a star', 'Believe Me Natalie'. Brandon Flowers' vocals have a very raw and unihibited feel yet he sings with emotion and soul. Alot of these tracks have awesome bandwork but Flowers injects these songs with life with his passionate singing; there is just a natural chemistry existing in this band. The only track that seems to be blatantly out of place is 'Everything will be alright', this song is extremely laid back; featuring some synths, minor guitar work and distorted vocals... they should've edited this song out because it is totally unworthy of being in this album of great songs. This is an excellent debut worth every cent and great things can be expected from this group if they continue this calibre of work!    * I gave this album a 4.5 star rating but since i can't give that rating on amazon, i decided to go with a 5 star rating.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|My mother-in-law gave me this CD after the birth of my daughter.  Celine hit the nail on the head.  The lyrics really get to the heart of all the emotions involved in giving birth and raising a child.  The beautiful music is peaceful and soothing.  My baby and I listen to this as I rock her to sleep, and we are both drifting off to dream before the CD is over. This would be a wonderful gift for a new mom.  I love it.
B000002UHG|5.0|I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan. I own every album and just recently started collecting solo albums by Floyd members. I have allways loved Gilmour, Waters and Barrett but never really thought that Wright was an important Floyd member... O man I was wrong! I never realized that Wright does more then just play the Keyboard. He also SINGS!!!! I love his voice its so smooth and peaceful. I never realized he sang some of my favorite songs like Wearing the Inside Out, Burning Bridges, Stay?, and some others I think. Wright is also the one who did a lot of work on DSOTM and the sound effects! This album is beautifuly writtn, this is as close as you will get to the old Pink Floyd sound!... I'm searching around for the other album he created \\"Wet Dream\\" but I can't find it any where... Email me at TheDarkSide73@gmail.com if u know where I can purchase Wet Dream.

B000031WD9|1.0|I think this film says more of the insecurities of the film makers than anything else. This film made me realise why many people don't like America, and is little wonder why Americans seem to relate to it. The high school \\"dudes\\" treat women in the same way that their politicians treat foreign countries.
1401300901|5.0|This book had me  from beginning to end, excited for each new chapter and new letter from Gerry. I would recommend this to anyone!
068987474X|1.0|This book speaks to women as though we're 12 year-olds with the emotional maturity of gnats. <br /> <br />Who is this Greg guy anyways? How the hell does he know what every man/woman in the world is thinking? <br /> <br />First of all, this book assumes that every woman in the world is dying to \\"trap a man.\\" I find that really humourous since, on Sex and the City, this line was originally said to Miranda's character, who was the opposite of a marriage-obsessed, husband hunter. Therefore, I believed this book would be much more empowering than it is. Not once during the book is it acknowledged that a woman can enjoy a casual, sexual relationship without expecting a diamond ring! <br /> <br />Second of all, several times during the book there are these sidebars that read \\"100% of guys polled say...\\" As a journalist, It's my natural instinct to disregard polls that involve less than 1000 subjects, because they do not reflect an accurate sample of the population. There is no info about these \\"polls.\\" How many men were polled? What were they asked? What is the margin of error? Highly suspect. <br /> <br />This book also goes out of it's way to ensure the reader is buying into it's every word. Unscientific polls are just the begining. It has sections headed with the line \\"Still Don't Believe Us?\\" which proceed to tell an anecdote about someone that authors know (now I'm convinced!)who acted in a certain way. As I was reading, I had to ask myself, why are these people trying to brainwash me? What do they get out of it? I found that these flimsy polls and anecdotes were absolutley insulting to my intelligence. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I know this is supposed to be a fun read. But I think it's \\"fun\\" that's somewhat designed to make women feel disempowered and not smart. Reading things like \\"Hey, pretty girl who's reading this book,\\" (or some such thing) makes me SO angry. It's so condescending, and what makes the authors think I need to be validated by being called \\"pretty.\\" It seems what's actually being said is \\"Woman who's reading this book because you're pathetic, you need me to reassure you how awesome and pretty and sexy you are.\\" Pull-ease.  <br />        <br />One particularily nauseating part featured a note from our (the readers') future boyfriend. The note calls us \\"hot stuff\\" and \\"tasty\\"...It's just so unbelievably cheesy and it made me feel like I was being addressed as a child. <br /> <br />Any women out there who considers herself intelligent, powerful and capable of critical thought should stay far away from this book.  <br />
B00000JY1X|4.0|I'm not sure whether to call this album overrated. It has more than enough amazing songs to fill a standard-length LP, but the amount of completely unbearable tracks in between makes it difficult to listen to. You can't just lie back and relax when any of the 3 discs in this set are on: one finger must continuously stay trained on the skip button. <br /> <br />The other problem is that even the amazing tracks have irony-soaked lyrics that can alternately be hilarious and annoying, depending on your mood. some real gems: \\"we've got so many tchotchkes we've practically emptied the louvre/ in most of our palaces, there's hardly room to manoeuvre\\" (from Zebra, and candidate for one of the greatest rhymes of all time); and \\"be we in paris or in lansing/ nothing matters when we're dancing\\" <br /> <br />Most people can't get into something that's basically sublimely beautiful novelty songs, let alone shell out $35 for it. If you know a friend who has it, it's definitely worth a listen.

B00068IOWM|2.0|The songs were great on the CD.  The packaging leaves a lot to be desired, especially the CD being exposed in the sleeve.  The booklet is a one time read and not very interesting.

B0006399FS|4.0|I can't really place this album within U2's complete oeuvre, and I don't care to try.  In my very humble opinion, \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" was half of a stupendous album, and half complete throwaway material.  \\"How to Dismantle\\" has a better batting average; there are fewer flyover tracks.  But the album as a whole never really rises to the soaring, effortless level of the first half of \\"All That You Can't...\\" either.  So this is a very listenable, intelligent album. I'm glad I bought it.  And when you're 41, there isn't too much music out there that doesn't leave you feeling older than dirt.    I wanted to weigh in because I think a lot of people expect way too much from albums like this.  U2 has been making music for 25 years; they know what they do well.  To expect endless novelty from a group like this is pretty silly, in my opinion.  If you judge this album on the terms appropriate for an established, very successful band--sincerity, professionalism, energy, good songwriting--it comes out a winner.  It's not revolutionary, but then again, very few middle-aged professionals are.
B00030590I|4.0|I have reasons to like and reasons to dislike this movie. <br /> <br />There is a bit of a spoiler here, but kind of needed for the review.  If you hate spoilers, skip to the next review. <br /> <br />On the plus side, the cinematography is outstanding.  The movie is gorgeous.  The art direction is fantastic.  The actors give some of their best performances. <br /> <br />On the mixed side...  The soundtrack is by Tan Dun, which would be a plus, except it sounds far to similar to Crouching Tiger.  It is still good, but seems far to familiar. <br /> <br />On the negative side...  One of the reviewers compared the movie to \\"Communist Progaganda\\".  He has a point.  The main message of the movie seems to be that citizens have the duty to die for the state in order to insure its survival.  (Because to fight the state would cause chaos and that is worse than death.)  I disagree very strongly with any philosophy that puts the life of the state above that of its citizens.  I can understand it, given the handover of Hong Kong to mainland China.  It is still a very strong negative for me. <br /> <br />Still, it is a very good movie mared by a philisophically repugnant ending.  But if you are a fan of Chinese cinema, you still need to see it, warts and all.  It is still an impressive film.
B00008LDPU|5.0|This collection of nine animated films (actually eight, one arbitrarily divided into two parts) inspired by THE MATRIX (1999) explores aspects of Matrix-mythology glossed over in the feature films. The First, \\"Final Flight of the Osiris,\\" played briefly in theaters shortly before THE MATRIX RELOADED (2003) opened. Animated in the photo-realistic style of 2001's FINAL FANTASY: THE SPIRITS WITHIN and written by the Wachowski brothers, \\"Osiris\\" follows the ship's last doomed mission. Its crew, Jue and Thadeus (Voices of Pamela Segall and Kevin Micheal Richardson), are the first to spot the drilling machine and the sentinel army that threaten Zion in RELOADED, and Jue makes a daring leap into the Matrix to deliver a warning. <br />\\"The Second Renaissance, Parts I and II,\\" also written by the Wachowskis, constitute a prequel to both MATRIX features. The conceit: We're viewing Zion historical file 12-1, which chronicles the rise of the machines, from their earliest, mindless incarnations to the sensational murder trial of B166-ER, the first android to kill its master, and the founding of the machine nation Zero-one. Persecuted by a coalition of fearful human nations, the citizens of Zero-one fight back; in a last ditch effort, humanity blots out the sun in hopes of starving the machines of solar energy. But they compensate, eventually enslaving their former human masters. <br />In \\"Kid's Story,\\" alienated hacker Micheal Popper (Clayton Watson) gets a call from Neo (Keanu Reeves) and makes a perilous escape from the Matrix. <br />\\"Program\\" follows Cis (Hedy Burress) as she participates in a favorite fight simulation set in feudal Japan. But her training partner, Duo (Phil LaMarr), has made a deal to return to the Matrix; Cis can join him or die. <br />\\"World Record.\\" the least attractivly animated film in the group, chronicles the unusual awakening of Dan Davis (Victor Williams), an Olymic caliber runner who pushes himself beyond the bounds of human endurance and creates arip in the veil of the Matrix. <br />In the spooky \\"Beyond,\\" teenage Yoko (Hedy Buress) tracks her cat, Yuki, to a local \\"Haunted House\\" where neighborhood kids have discovered the laws of nature don't apply. Cans float in midair, a broken light bulb appears and diappears in a flash of light, youngsters turn cartwheels in the air and drift to earth like feathers. They're experiencing a glitch in the Matrix, and debuggers are on their way to fix it. Writor-director Koji Morimoto's haunting short story offers a genuinely different view of the world of THE MATRIX, from its old-fashioned Japanese architecture to its quizzical ending.  <br />The B&W film noir pastiche \\"A Detective Story\\" reaches back to Trinity's (Carrie-Anne Moss) pre-Neo life as a super hacker, and follows the efforts of a hardboiled dick (James Arnold Taylor) to track her down. <br />Finally, in \\"Matriculated,\\" human revolutionaries try to convert machines to their cause by creating a Matrix of their own. Though the premise is clever, writor-director Peter Chung (\\"Aeon Flux\\") get bogged down in psycheldelic images that make the film look like a Frutopia commercial.  <br />MATRIX completists (Including me) will revel in the films' interlocking stories and animation buffs will appreciate the range of talent the Wachoskis brought to bear on these shorts, including noted anime directors Yoshiaki Kawajiri (VAMPIRE HUNTER  D: BLOODLUST) and Shinichiro Wantabe (COWBOY BEBOP).
0385510454|2.0|I'll give Grisham credit for one thing -- most of his books are at least an OK read. That is about all one can say about this one. Here, the plot is not very interesting, the character is not very sympathetic, and Grisham departs from his usual legal thriller genre and makes a foray into writing a spy thriller. The effort is not successful. Grisham plainly is simply not very knowledgeable about espionage, and this fact subtly permeates the novel. This novel just does not have the feel of authenticity that is characteristic of a good spy novel. Grisham admits as much in the novel's \\"afterwards\\" and he is quite right. And in my opinion this was a significant detriment.<br /><br />The storyline to this one is murky and not particularly interesting. The core of the novel is a long draggy segment in which the protagonist is in Italy trying to assimilate the language and culture. Not very interesting and this travelog fails to disguise the fact that this novel does not have much of a plot or much of a story.<br /><br />Grisham is at his best when he sets out to write a story about the legal profession, although his recent efforts in that direction have been disappointing too. This one gets two stars due to its modest readability, but is otherwise a plain disappointment. RJB.

0316172324|5.0|In his latest bestseller, Malcolm Gladwell examines how human beings often make critical choices in a fraction of a second. Sometimes judgments made on very little evidence are far more accurate than those based on volumes of data. What are the consequences of our snap decisions? Anyone interested in marketing and human behavior will be fascinated by this book.<br /><br />In his first book, The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference, Malcolm Gladwell examined why change so often happens as quickly and as unexpectedly as it does. His insights help make sense out of sudden social change.<br /><br />Our intuitions, as humans, aren't always very good, he says. Changes that happen really suddenly, on the strength of the most minor input, can be deeply confusing.<br /><br />Now, in Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Gladwell furthers his exploration of fast moving ideas, this time focusing on how individuals can make almost instantaneous decisions based on very sketchy evidence. Or what seems like little evidence.<br /><br />Actually, relying on a gut feeling, and making a decision in the blink of an eye, is actually drawing on your lifetime of experience and jumping to a conclusion after synthesizing very little of the current evidence. If you do this well, Gladwell says you are \\"thin slicing,\\" or making a judgment based on a very small amount of data.<br /><br />When this works well, your snap decisions are accurate and insightful. Such decisions save time and money and can even eliminate the agony of human heartbreak. However, in most cases, the decision maker can't explain why or how she makes an instantaneous decision.<br /><br />In Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking, Gladwell helps us understand the why and how.<br /><br />* Why one doctor is more likely than another to be sued for malpractice than another doctors of equal technical competence.<br /><br />* How an expert psychologist can watch a newly married couple interact for only 15 minutes and predict, with surprising accuracy, whether they will still be married in 15 years.<br /><br />* How political operatives can influence our vote by running candidates that we are predisposed to elect, despite their incompetence.<br /><br />* Why and how a rogue military commander can easily outwit an army of experienced generals who are armed with volumes of intelligence and computer analysis.<br /><br />Blink's lessons for marketers: An understanding of how consumers make buying decisions is critical to marketing any product.<br /><br />Gladwell is a master storyteller and he weaves innumerable fascinating tales from the world of marketing to provide the anecdotal evidence that support his premises.<br /><br />In his less life-threatening tales, Gladwell covers a broad landscape of psychological testing and product branding experiences that will entertain and delight any serious marketer.<br /><br />* The Pepsi Challenge: Was it really fair or conclusive?<br /><br />* How do the product and the package become a single entity in the mind of the consumer?<br /><br />* How was margarine transformed into a desirable product after being rejected by a generation raised on butter?<br /><br />Gladwell makes a strong case for \\"mind reading,\\" or learning to trust your instincts when you read the subtlest of minimal cues on another human's face.<br /><br />Alternatively, he cites examples of how we are conditioned by a lifetime of unconscious prejudice to draw conclusions that are false and, in some cases, dangerous.<br /><br />Beware: the consequences of incorrectly interpreting the minimal cues on a human face can be fatal. Witness New York City police killing an unarmed citizen, Amadou Diallo, when, under extreme stress, they interpret fast unfolding events incorrectly and are certain they see him brandish a handgun when none exists.<br /><br />\\"Our unconscious reactions come out of a locked room and we can't look inside that room,\\" writes Gladwell. \\"But with experience we become expert at using our behavior and our training to interpret -- and decode -- what lies behind our snap judgments and first impressions.\\"<br /><br />--Peter A. Schaiblessions.\\"    --Peter A. Schaible
078322933X|5.0|You will not be able to get up and get some chips and pop while watching this thriller.I loved it,except for the dog part.
0684803356|5.0|This book is definitely a \\"desert-island\\" book for me.  I love all of Hemingway's extensive body of works, but this novel is by far my favourite.  The story is about a young American man who is fighting voluntarily against Franco's Fascist forces in Spain.  This man ends up leading a band of guerillas in what turns out to be a totally useless military foray.  The novel itself only encompasses seventy-two hours, but in that time Robert Jordan, our American hero, loses his comrades in battle, falls in love, and is badly wounded.  Hemingway's writing is masterful in this classic!  This book, even more than \\"A Farewell to Arms\\" outlines Hemingway's thoughts on the futility of war, and the effect that war has on one single man.  Even though the novel encompasses such a short time, Hemingway makes use of flashbacks to bring the reader into the series of events that led to this particular point in Jordan's life.  Again, Hemingway makes use of personal experiences for this novel.  He was actually involved himself in this Spanish civil war.  His writing style is spare, although incredibly vivid.  This is a truly wonderful book, that I feel encompasses all the best of Ernest Hemingway.

Whole towns shut down on friday nights cause everyone is at the game...the story of the movie is amazing and exciting, the best part is that it is all true. Great movie, highly recommended for the entire family!
B0006SSOHM|5.0|OK, so when I went to the theater to see this one I was thinking \\"another lame 'Ring' or 'THe Others\\" I was very,very wrong.  <br />    This movie is one of the creepiest and screwed up movies I have seen in a long time. A long time being since I've seen House of 1000 Corspes (a classic). Anyways, I must say that if you missed it in theaters, don't smack yourself in the face too much- watch the DVD. Why? Have you ever wanted to see some fat guy tunnel his way through a tangle of razor wire? You'll see it here. There's also many other crazy ways that people get killed-and there's a toy clown that actually MAKES the movie. Watch this, you'll love it!!
0767818040|2.0|Well i didnt rate it the best. If you want action the whole way threw the movie, then dont buy it. One action part turn my stomach a bit. I bought this movie for 2.99 Canadian. I knew it would be some type of a flop but hey it's only 3.00 right. If u like to laugh at cheesy things go ahead watch it. If ur looking for one sex scene go ahead watch it. To me when I watched it, the movie said to me an old cheesy, slightly porno type movie. With the cheesy lines, cheesy plot and cheesy music to me that shouts porno.
B00030590I|3.0|After reading some of these reviews I was not sure I saw the same film.  As far as the politics and history of the movie are concerned, it is irrelevant.  At that time of civilization most of the earth was in conflict.  I believe this movie was intended to show the transformation of Nameless as a bitter assasin driven by human rage to a man of ideals.  No more no less.  I have read about some of the ancient history of China and it is as complicated as complicated can get. <br />This movie compares with Gone With the Wind as an historically based novel.  Just like Gone With the Wind we see character transformation instigated from the outside events.  Don't get me wrong, Gone With the Wind has no comparison in its genre. <br />I would have given this 3 and 1/2 stars but as you all know that is not a choice.  I recommend this movie as a good movie but not as a history or idealistic movie.  Jet Li is a good actor.
0783230702|4.0|Bruce Willis (Die Hard, Sixth Sense) stars as a convict from the near future, where everyone lives underground due to a viral apocalypse that killed 90% of the earth's population. Somehow time travel was invented (this is the hardest part of the story to buy into, since it is only 30 years or so into the future...) so they send the convicts back in time to learn the origin of the virus and get a sample, with the goal of finding a vaccination. <br /> <br />In his first journey into the past, Willis meets Madeline Stowe, a psychiatrist who is an intrinsic part of Willis's destiny, and Brad Pitt, a fellow patient who is also woven into the fabric of Willis's life. Pitt's incredible acting is enough to make this DVD a \\"must own\\" for any science fiction collection. <br /> <br />12 Monkeys is a quirky science fiction film that is above average in almost every way. The herky-jerky, tilted camera angles preferred by director Terry Gilliam take some getting used to, and some of the minor characters (especially Stowe's older psychiatric colleague) are REALLY ANNOYING. These minor details make it a 4 star rather than a 5 star movie in my opinion, but 12 Monkeys is still a unique and very interesting film.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Retro never looked so wonderful in the nearly all digital world of Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow. This science fiction adventure combines Flash Gordon with Fritz Lang's classic Metropolis creating a unique look for this pulp adventure. Jude Law stars as the wizard of the skies Joe Sullivan (AKA \\"Sky Captain\\") and Gwyneth Paltrow plays his love interest reporter Polly Perkins in an adventure where the existence of our world is threatened by a mad scientist (Laurence Oliver in a beyond-the-grave cameo performance that could only happen with the advent of digital technology. bend on wiping out humanity. Angelina Jolie turns in a wonderful cameo as the eye patch wearing pilot Captain `Franky' Cook. No pulp adventure would be complete without a plucky sidekick winningly embodies by the marvelous Giovanni Ribisi. While there are some time flight actors here, the real star of this movie is director/writer Kerry Conran who toiled for years in obscurity to make this film a reality. A fun visual feast featuring references to everything from King Kong to Marathon Man, Sky Captain turns into a treasure trove of other film experiences packed into an exciting adventure that everyone from kids to adults will enjoy. While it may not be high art, like Raiders of the Lost Ark its marvelous fun.<br /><br />Discussing the image quality is subjective here for a number of reasons. Since this film is designed to look highly stylized with gauzy soft focus and simulation of the old two color Technicolor process (which always seemed trapped between the world of color and black and white), it's hard to compare it to other films or their look. I can compare it to the original theatrical version of the film. Sky Captain on DVD carefully captures the look, texture and rich surreal color of the original theatrical version of the film. At times the images almost look like they revert to black and white imagery with touches of gray, flesh tones and light blue all capturing the look of early Technicolor films.  The 5.1 surround sound mix actively moves from speaker to speaker keeping in perfect step with the action and draping the listener in the experience of the film.  With witty visual allusions to the original RKO Radio logo, pulp fiction heroes of the 30's and early 40's and other films Sky Captain plays like an old film fan's wet dream.<br /><br /> \\"Brave New World\\" consists of  two documentaries on the making of the film. The first part focuses from conception to the birth of the six minute film Conran used to sell Jon Avent on making a feature film (which is included as an extra and with many images that ended up in the finished film with better detail) through to the design of the characters, robot monsters and the inspiration that they used from the pulp magazines. Part two discusses the actual production of the film and how it moved from the idea of using actual pictures of the late 30's and early 40's of New York as back plates to creating a highly stylized city in the computer for the actors and CGI creatures to interact in. Most of the six minute film was created with second hand computers. Sky Captain and the Flying Legion in the World of Tomorrow: Chapter One Mechanical Monsters (made on an old Apple Two) was presented to Paramount after the initial six minute demo was presented and Gwyneth Paltrow had signed on. Since there were virtually no sets Conran and visual effects people were constantly challenged by issues such as disc space, system failures and other gremlins that dog the computer world. Amazingly shot on a budget of $40 million and having to call in other effects houses at the last minute to help bring the film in on time and on budget, Sky Captain managed to walk the highwire of technology, creativity & commercial projects from Hollywood and be entertaining.<br /><br /> We get a comprehensive commentary track by the director and visual effects supervisors who discuss some of the more complex shots, visual tributes to otherfilms and what's real and what's not. Overall, a fine commentary track that balances technical discussions with stuff that will interest the average film fan.<br /><br /> A fun bit of cinema that recalls Raiders of the Lost Ark with its retro feel and the serials of the 30's and 40's with the wit and technology of the 21st century, Sky Captain has all the fun that was squeezed out of franchise films, sequels and witty performances to boot. Sure, it's an imperfect film as the script occasionally reaches for more than it can convincingly pull off but for sheer visual style and ambition Sky Captain can't be beat.other films and what's real and what's not.

068485743X|5.0|I absolutely love this book! Okay, I'm gushing...but I think every wannabe published writer needs to read this book BEFORE they spend hours and hours in trying to birth their first novel. This book doesn't teach readers how to write, but it does help them to understand the basic ground rules -- including pacing, showing versus telling, the importance of good dialogue, and characterization. This book will always have a spot on my bookshelf.

B00005JMYI|1.0|To tell you the truth I never finished the whole movie because I couldn't stand it after about a third of it.  It's made up of 30 second \\"jokes\\" that are very predictable and old.  I haven't seen alot of Will Farrell movies, but if this is his best work I don't want to see any others.  It's not even good enough to insult my intelligence.  It's just plain dumb.  If you must see this movie, rent it...don't buy it!!!

B0007CNXUK|5.0|Johnny Depp, a beautiful man, plays the reputedly gay author of Peter Pan, J.M. Barrie, in a story of how his love for four boys engendered the famous tale.  While one may quibble about the appropriateness of a line or two, the telling of how Peter Pan came to be is not only magnificent and near flawless, but without doubt one of the more courageous tales of modern cinema, particularly in the way that Depp's performance, devoid of sentimentality, coupled with a subtle script, leaves no doubt neither for the depth of his feeling for the boys nor its integrity.
0553278223|5.0|Clever, intriguing, and suprising! This is truly the work of a genius. It really opens up your mind and makes you want to sit down and write a science fiction masterpiece of your own!

This book is, without a doubt, worth all of your time! <br />
044024157X|2.0|I bought this book because the synopsis sounded good and because I knew John Grisham had a reputation of being a great author of suspense novels.  This book was ok, but just ok.  There wasn't any suspense that I could see, and it wasn't the type of book I couldn't put down.  It was just a nice little tale of a town and it's people.  Not a typical Grisham novel.

In order they are:  1) the entire 21 book series of Patrick O'Brian's Aubrey/Maturin historic naval literature (probably the best series of books I have ever read),  2) the three books of Neal Stephenson's Baroque Cycle (Quicksilver, The Confusion, and the System of the World), each book being better than the previous one, and 3) Shantaram.<br /><br />Shantaram is a love story from start to finish:  love of mankind, love of friends, love of a woman, love of a country, love of a city, love of an adversary, love of a way of life, love of a people, love of adventure, love of a father,  and, most apparent,  love for the reader.<br /><br />The protagonist (based on the writer himself) is a complex adventurer with a deep soul and a past which, though you and I can never fully appreciate it unless we have done similar things (highly unlikely...few of us have ever been tortured, for example, or kicked a heroin habit twice) is made accessible to us, complete with its feelings and lessons.<br /><br />The writing is superb, the characters have depth, the setting descriptions place you right there, the plots are intriguing, and the emotions, including humor, I cannot adequately describe, since I have nowhere near the skills of the writer, Gregory  Roberts.<br /><br />I cannot recommend the book more highly.  Please do yourself a favor and read it.
B0002YLC24|5.0|Having a nine-year gap between movies usually doesn't work out well for their makers, or the audience.... 'Before Sunset' is one very notable exception. We rejoin Jesse and Celine this time in Paris for a look at \\"what might've been\\" nine years after their blazing day/night in Vienna. The movie is one long dialogue-filled catching up session walking through the streets of Paris, in a bookstore, a cafe, on a boat and finally in her apartment. The interaction between them is filled with deep philosophical reflections on love, death, life, unhappiness and just about everything important in between. <br />The theme here shows that the writer/director has more than a passing fancy with 'Ulysses' by James Joyce. In fact, in the first movie, their meeting takes place on 'Bloomsday' June 16th which is the day chronicled in Joyce's massive novel. In the second movie, 'Shakespeare and Company' bookstore where 'Ulysses' was first published features prominently in the story because Jesse is talking about his own book which it just so happens chronicles a single important day in his life.... This little art imitating life and then reimitating art is a clever touch.  <br />The acting by both Ethan Hawke and Julie Delpy is intelligent, intense and most of all incredibly real! You feel like you know these characters as friends by the end of 'Before Sunset.' The ending is wisely kept open to the viewer's own interpretation of events. While seeing 'Before Sunrise' is not necessary to enjoy this movie, I would still recommend doing so first. For anybody out there who has had a one-night-stand and later on wondered \\"What if?\\" this movie is food for the heart and soul....
B00030590I|5.0|Jet Li plays a nameless warrior from the Qin province.  He stops 3 assassins from killing the king of Qin by slaying them himself. For his reward he is offered the chance to sit with the King and tell the stories of how he managed to kill the skilled warriors Sky, Broken Sword, and Falling Snow.<br /><br />It is a death that seems coordinated by these elegant players in a most beauteous and macabre fashion. The film, visually, is a work of art. The choreographed sword fighting scenes are reminiscent of dance steps at times, and the wire work is well timed and utilized in a way attractive to the eye. The effects are stunning as well. Periodically the characters use the elements to their disposal to fight against their opponents. Wind, water, earth, and fire are present throughout all of the film, many acting as weapons in the fight scenes.<br /><br />What I found most interesting was that the colours changed as different characters related the events in their own perceptions. When the nameless warrior spoke in the beginning the colour tones were warm crimsons, vermilions, opera pink, and golden. When the King told his impressions the colours changed  to a cold colour scheme, that of cyan, aqua, violet, and grays. Even when the character Sky revealed his thoughts the colours shifted again to citron and soft greens.  The rest of the film was resplendent in monotones, whites and earth tones, grays and black. Overall an extraordinary palette of colours and textures to tantalize the senses.
B0006284JQ|4.0|If you like Britney, you'll like this album. It's as simple as that. Being a huge Britney fan, I do own all her previous releases, and thus have heard the majority of songs on this album many many times (as well as most of America). The biggest draw with this album is that it's all her biggest hits (not necessarily her greatest songs) put together in a perfect fashion so they flow wonderfully. I love the flow of this CD. I was suprised that early 'Baby One More Time' Britney and later 'In the Zone' Britney could go together so well. The new songs (My Prerogative, I've Just Begun [Having My Fun], and Do Somethin') Are pretty good, and Do Somethin' is awesome. <br /> <br />     I give this CD 4 instead of 5 because even though it's her biggest hits, only some of them constitute as her greatest songs (Toxic, Baby One More Time etc. etc.) other great songs can be found on her studio albums... plus the new songs on here are average, except for Do Somethin', and what the heck is Outrageous doing on this album???
0743243307|3.0|I bought this book months ago during a book-buying frenzy and just got to it this month. The beginning of the book is so much better than the middle and the end. I never really got to know Nazneen well enough to care what happened to her. The book dragged way too much: the prolonged speeches by Chanu were unnecessary. Once we (the readers) figured out that Chanu liked to talk on and on and on rather than take action, all his subsequent speeches are unneccessary (so I skipped them). The long letters from her sister Hasina are also very annoying. The broken English (which I guess is supposed to be broken Bengali) really dragged the story down. When faced with 20 pages or more of italic printing (Hasina's letters) my interest waned. Not a good way of showing the passage of time. To better show the contrast of lives between the sisters, the author should have written chapters alternating between the two sisters' lives. That would have made Hasina seem more real to me, not just another annoyingly long letter I had to skim through. Also, because the description of the book tells the reader that Nazneen gets involved with a young man, I was looking forward to this event and was (again) ultimately disappointed. The love affair doesn't seem very intense and I don't see how it changed Nazneen at all. Although I applaud Nazneen's decision regarding the direction of her life, it seemed to come about it a rather ho-hum type of way. I found the book less than thrilling and am amazed at the 2-4 pages of quotes inside the book from critics (and other authors) deliriously declaring that this book is genuis and beautiful and worthy of tears of joy upon finishing it. I think they are crazy. I have read books worthy of shouting and crying, but not this one. If you want a good read by a new author, read The Time-Traveler's Wife. It is wonderful.
B00005JNDX|1.0|<br />Completely lacking in the originality and humor of the book, this is a sad sequel to a charming movie. <br />Reading both of Ms. Jone's diarys, we see that Bridget isn't fat, she just thinks she is. The one time she reaches her goal of 119 lbs, she looks emaciated and aged. The film ignores this and makes her a porker of epic proportions. <br />The best parts of Ms. Fielding's book center around Bridget's relationships with her friends, single and married. The film completely ignores this aspect, instead bringing back the tired love triangle between Bridget, Mark and Daniel.  <br />If Amazon had a negative star option, I'd give this sad sequel -20 stars. <br />Pathetic.
6305074194|4.0|This vintage John Carpenter film was made in collaboration with Debra Hill, who with Carpenter was responsible for the runaway success of \\"Halloween\\". When \\"The Fog\\" was first released, it was met with a fairly lukewarm reception. It has since gone on to achieve some acclaim, though it has never reached the heights of commercial success touched upon by \\"Halloween\\", though, then again, few films have.<br /><br />\\"The Fog\\" is a highly atmospheric ghost story. The ghosts manifest themselves on the stroke of midnight, as the fishing village of Antonio Bay gets ready to celebrate its centennial. As the midnight hour rolls in, so does an unearthly fog that begins to engulf the whole town. It is a fog that enshrouds of the ghosts of those whose ship was  lured to the rocky coast, only to find itself dashed to bits on the rocks, causing all aboard to plummet  to the nether regions of Davy Jones' locker.<br /><br />It appears that those aboard that ill-fated ship were a colony of lepers whose leader, a wealthy man, had paid the townspeople of Antonio Bay a fortune in gold to be allowed to disembark at Antonio Bay. The townspeople set up a false disembarkation point that they knew to be deadly. The ghosts of these unfortunate souls are now hell bent on seeking revenge for the gold that was taken from them by the early inhabitants of Antonio bay with false promises of sanctuary.<br /><br />The special effects in the film are excellent, as is the musical score composed by none other than John Carpenter himself. This is for the most part a subtle, creepy film, highlighted by a stellar cast. If you are looking for a blood and gore slasher film, this is not the film for you. If, however, you enjoy a terse, tightly written script, as well as a pulse pounding musical score, then you will enjoy this highly atmospheric, ghost story. I originally saw this film in the theatre when it was first released and still remember the effectiveness of the fog rolling across the huge silver screen and the pulse pounding, musical score, which was such an excellent accompaniment to the film. Time has not diminished its power.and the pulse pounding, musical score, which was such an excellent accompaniment to the film. Time has not diminished its power.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I have to admit that if I seen this DVD on the shelf I would have passed it by.  I kept hearing on the local radio station; Rent  \\"Napoleon Dynamite!\\"  The disc jockeys would reference some saying from the film like, Gosh!  I felt like I was missing out on a rip-roaring movie. The disc jockeys said it was destine to be a cult classic. So, I had to rent it.<br /><br />I found out, Napoleon Dynamite (John Heder) is actually a person. Napoleon's appearance is right out of the 80's. I thought this movie was set in the early 1980's. But when Napoleon said Uncle Rico (Jon Gries) is stuck in 1982 the setting had to be present day. There are so many quotable phrases like gosh and freakin' idiot that they might become part of normal conversation.<br /><br />Napoleon is a high school geek. He is no longer affected by any cut down remarks or being picked on by his schoolmates. He reciprocates with his own gestures and comments. Other characters include Napoleon's love interest Deb (Tina Majorino), his 32-year-old brother Kip (Aaron Ruell) and school friend Pedro. (Efren Ramirez) Are they all geeks or unique in their own way? But all of these characters are relatable to everyone now or from the past. That is why this movie is so interesting. It gets the viewer thinking! You might have to view the movie a couple of times to catch all of the comedic, quotable dialogue.<br /><br />The movie takes place in the Director's (Jared Hess) old hometown of Preston, Idaho. The bonus features include the original short \\"Peluca\\" from which this movie came alive.
B00005JLR2|4.0|Treasure Planet was a positive surprise, and I am a big Disney-fan! Fantastic animation, good story. The music, well, it was a treasure itself found to hear the voice of John Rzeznik, his two songs are superb! The rest of the soundtrack suits the movie as well. What an adventure! <br /> <br />Of course when you watch a Disney-movie you have got to keep in mind that it's a childrens' movie (basically that is) - so to the reviewers who claims Treasure Island to be unrealistic, sorry, but haven't you perhaps missed a great point here? (I mean: \\"What do they breathe?\\"!!) <br /> <br />People have, of course, a right not to find the movie amusing, but it must be considered that it's a fantasy-movie. Fish don't communicate the way they do in Finding Nemo either, in \\"Fantasyworld\\" everything is possible! <br /> <br />Another great classic from Disney! <br />  <br />
B000005S0E|5.0|...is how I would describe the sound of one of my favorite and most underrated Cure albums, The Top. Not quite a masterpiece, like Disintegration or Pornography, but Robert continues in the fun and colorful pop direction of the Japanese Whispers singles with this somewhat scattered collection of catchy tunes and sharp-edged gloom. This album is both danceable and spooky, sometimes even on the same track. It's worth picking up for the rocking opener \\"Shake Dog Shake\\" alone - and be sure not to miss what could be the most twisted track in The Cure's catalogue, \\"Bananafishbones\\". Other highlights include \\"Piggy In The Mirror\\" and the beautifully haunting self-titled closer. Highly recommended for fans of The Cure who have already purchased the band's aforementioned two most important records. I would rank this album on par with Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me and Wish. \\"This top is the place... where nobody goes... You just imagine. You just imagine it all.\\"
B00064MW6A|4.0|This movie was by no means AMAZING, but it was entertaining. I  expected it to be terrible from all the negative buzz it got from critics. It really wasn't all that bad. Sure, the graphics could have been better, but I've watched pretty much every single movie that has been out for rent recently and it stands out as one of my favorites.
B0002MPU1K|5.0|I first heard of this CD the other night on Bravo Channel in Toronto.  He has a music video from it called St. Louis Blues.  I was immediately drawn to the sound and thought the guy was very good.  I bought it the next day quickly to find the whole CD very melodic, jazzy and at times a bit Steeley Dan.  The title track can play at your heart strings and would sound great on some finely tuned high end speakers. The entire CD is a very good listen.
B000002572|5.0|This album by Boston is solid on so many levels.  The creative interplay between guitars and keyboards with innovative melodies and counter-melodies is really quite remarkable in the genre of rock music.  The harmonies are rich and creative as well.  200 years from now when musicologists are studying the music of the 1970's, this album will be studied as people study a Haydn symphony now to study the 1770's.
0670033375|4.0|I would recommend this book without a problem. It was thought provoking and an easy read.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|This movie was by far the worst Ben Stiller movie EVER. The movie was not even  stupid funny. I never laughed through the whole thing. I don't recommend this movie to anyone. To sum it up in one word it's simply terrible
B00003CXBH|5.0|This film is potently uplifting. The scene involving DeNiro's long awaited redemption- the music, his acting, the context, the waterfalls, the color- everything falls into place. I'm a cinematography major and the lens work in this movie is incredible - It reminds you how good an experience a seriously crafted film can be. I've read reviews that think otherwise and I question whether they actually watched it or just skimmed around looking for explosions and war battles. Those who aren't effected are most likely bored with its maturity. DeNiro is a swordsman, Irons is a priest, they both live in a brutal time. Check it out, it will remind you how movies should be made.
0441003257|3.0|***1/2 <br /> <br />Okay, maybe it will be, but it won't be up for any Emmys. <br /> <br />I cherish the breadth and fertility of Gaiman's myth-absorbing and mythmaking gift, and felt it was time to expose myself to Pratchett. So this volume seemed a good bet. <br /> <br />Good Omens starts off on a roll. Page one, with its Edenic serpent named Crawly, drew a guffaw. Sister Mary Loquacious, and the serpent's 20th century transmogrification into an oily Leisure Suit Larry, and the delightfully fractured pseudo 15th century English of Agnes Nutter, witch, that infallible and luckless prophetess, sparked one chortle after another. <br /> <br />But then the pleasurable inventiveness slacked off, and the nearer Armageddon approached, the more the plot began to plod and strain. It became apparent that the book, composed some fifteen years ago, was a gentle takeoff on eighties pop demonology, from The Exorcist to the interminable Omen sequels. Because the present, more serious, mania over the Left Behind books cries out for a more stinging brand of satire, the whole enterprise started feeling kind of dated to me. The cover blurbs promise a worthy successor to Hitchhiker's Guide. A tall order that, and not surprisingly, it wasn't delivered. I understand the blurbers' temptation to make the claim; the Guide's wry British understatement, and Prefect-like bumbling are there. But Doug Adams' best features, those cosmic non sequiturs and inescapable twists of demented logic, weren't forthcoming.  <br /> <br />Overall, it was pretty funny, fairly engaging, and the plot didn't feel contrived until quite near the end. Underlying it all, and largely compensating for the lack of bite in the satire, is a firm streak of humane common sense in both our authors. <br /> <br />I wouldn't warn anyone away from this likable confection. But it's a poor place to start to get a fix on Gaiman's sizable talents. I'll seek out Discworld soon, trusting that the same will prove true of Pratchett. <br />
0670033693|5.0|Coming from a small town myself, I was facinated by the characters in this book... I felt like I actually knew them by the last page and it left me wanting more...I want to know if Vic and her husband split and if there is some romance ahead for our hero and his foul-mouthed deputy...will Lucian continue to kick butt even at his ripe old retired age...will Henry Standing Bear continue to entertain us with more Indian Insight and Wisdom and will Ruby continue to keep Sheriff Longmire up on his manners and social ettiquette  The twists and turns in this fast paced mystery had me change my \\"who done it\\" more than once and still didn't have it figured out in the end, which is exactly the kind of story challenge that I love.  As others have said in their reviews, you actually feel the cold wind and the snow falling and I found myself looking out the window to see if it was actually happening or not.  Having some Indian ancestry in my family, I thoroughly enjoyed the references to the folklore and lives of the reservation inhabitants and the mystique of the spirits in Chapter 12.  Hurry up and get that next book written Craig...we're all out here waiting with anticipation!!!
B000002LMK|5.0|Only three artists have put out meaningful music in five separate decades: the 60s, 70s, 80s, 90s and now the 00s.  That list is as follows:  Johnny Cash (and he goes back to the 50s), Bob Dylan, and Neil Young.  The criteria is simple:  Five decades with at least one great album.  I really cannot put any other artist on this list.  Many have come close (such as Van Morrison, Willie Nelson, Paul McCartney, Brian Wilson, Ray Charles, Jagger/Richards), but these three stand alone.<br /><br />For me, Young barely avoided exclusion from the list by two months.  His 80s output was downright sickly.  In fact, Young was headed for the same territory as his erstwhile bandmates Crosby, Stills & Nash (i.e. oblivion) when he suddenly righted the ship with two wonderful CDs: October 1989's FREEDOM and then one of my very favorite Neil Young albums -- RAGGED GLORY.  This album easily equals any grunge CD put out during the 90s, and it catapaulted Young from \\"70s rock icon\\" to \\"all-time legend\\".<br /><br />I don't have a very complicated method for judging albums.  To me, if every song on the album is great and I never have to hit the \\"skip\\" button, it's a great album.  Period.  That list of albums is few and far between, but RAGGED GLORY makes the cut with flying colors.<br /><br />What makes the songs themselves so great? Very simply, the melodies are strong and the guitars are loud.  The results are songs that completely rock.  There's nothing cheesy or preachy about RAGGED GLORY.  Just ten straight-up, nonstop total jams.  He proved this album wasn't a fluke with his subsequent 90s releases, but RAGGED GLORY signalled that Neil Young was not at all ready to settle for \\"greatest hits\\" tours, or trade on past glories in order to create new albums.<br /><br />If you only have 70s Neil, you're missing out on a vital body of work.  Start with HARVEST MOON, then come to RAGGED GLORY.
2221090810|3.0|Marc Levy, if I remember correctly, had all four of his novels on the French bestseller list recently.  When I asked him last month which one I should read, he shrugged his shoulders as if they were all the same and replied: The first one?  As it turns out, Et si c'etait vrai... has been translated into English (If Only It Were True) and DreamWorks has bought the movie rights.  The movie, called Just Like Heaven, is currently filming with Reese Witherspoon and Mark Ruffalo in the lead roles and is scheduled for release this fall. <br /> <br />With Witherspoon and Ruffalo in the mix, you can guess that this is not War and Peace.  Et si c'etait vrai... is a fantasy about Lauren, a young, attractive San Francisco doctor who has a car accident and is pronounced dead (a lesson that young, attractive doctors should definitely wear their seatbelts).  She manages to come back to life, but only to be in a coma indefinitely.  We flash forward a few months to her apartment, recently inhabited by Arthur, a young, attractive San Francisco architect who is taking a bath.  He opens his bathroom closet to find Lauren snapping along to the music and learns that only he can see, hear, and touch her spirit while her body remains in the hospital.  Antics ensue, there is a bit of banter back and forth between Lauren and Arthur, and finally a denouement develops that is enjoyable and satisfying enough. <br /> <br />Levy sticks to what he knows in his first novel: he lived in San Francisco for almost a decade and he was an architect before becoming an author.  The novel is flawed, in particular when it gets off track from the adventure of Lauren and Arthur to delve into Arthur's past and the psychological scars it has left.  But it is light reading and a good chance for Americans to work their French and to get a glimpse of French pop culture.  Yes, there is such a thing, and Marc Levy is in the heart of it.
B00015YVD6|5.0|I was seven years old when I first watched Splash.  I watched it every time it was on cable.  It drove my parents and siblings crazy.  To this date, I still can't resist watching Splash, which is why I own both the video and DVD.  This romantic fantasy starring Tom Hanks and Darryl Hannah is my all-time favorite movie.  The story begins when Allen was a little boy.  He saw a young mermaid when he jumped off a Cape Cod ferry and has been fascinated with fish ever since.  Twenty years later, he meets a beautiful stranger on the same Cape Cod beach.  She follows him to New York and they have a wonderful time.  She does not tell him that she is a mermaid -- the same mermaid he saw when he was a kid -- and tells him that she cannot stay with him longer than six days.  What follows is a sweet and funny love story with timeless quality.<br /><br />Darryl Hannah's portrayal of Madison (named after Madison Avenue) is kind of subdued at times, but she is quite funny in various scenes, especially the scenes where she blows off the TVs and devours a lobster with ths skin and shell still on.  She and Tom Hanks had great chemistry and I loved their romantic scenes.  The ones that keep the comedy great are Tom Hanks, John Candy and Eugene Levy.  I loved the scenes with Hanks and Candy.  They had excellent comic timing.  A lot of scenes are fat-fetched, especially the one where Madison learns the entire English language by watching six hours of television at Bloomingdale's, but the film threw reality out the window with the whole mermaid thing, so reality is not an issue here.  Most films aren't realistic anyway.  The ending is absolutely beautiful.  It still touches me when I watch it.  I recommend this DVD.  It has bonus features that you won't want to miss!  I loved watching the making of this memorable film.  Splash will always be my favorite film, and this DVD makes it even better.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This DVD set is nearly perfect.  These are the best movies ever and they've just been slightly changed to fit with the prequels better, which is fine with me.  I'm really getting tired of hearing people complain about how the movies have been changed from the originals.  You know that all 6 movies will be released together in about a year when episode III is put onto dvd, and maybe that set will include the original versions, who knows.  The best thing to do would have been to release dvds that allowed people to choose scenes they wanted, so if they wanted to see the movies the original way or with the new scenes, they could.  Everyone should just stop bashing this set already though, because the 3.5 star rating is making these movies look bad, while they are really the best ever.
B00006IX0R|5.0|This band was one of the best bands of the 90's and no doubt the best female-fronted band of the decade. The lead singer's Celtic wail gave them a distinguishable sound *yeah, we had had similar vocal styles from Sarah Mclachlan and Sinead O'Conner, but this was a different sound.* <br /> <br />As far as the material, the album is kicked off right away with their most familiar and radio friendly material. \\"Dreams\\" is still one of my favorite songs and is actually still played quite a bit on the radio as is their biggest commercial hit, the ballad \\"Linger.\\" Both tracks are awesome. \\"Zombie\\" was the band's big rock hit and is a powerful track. My favorite song is probably \\"Ode To My family\\" which I have always found sort of endearing for some reason. Some of my other personal highlights include \\"Be With You\\", \\"Free To Decide\\" and \\"Analyze.\\" <br /> <br />For fans of the alternative bands of the 90's, this is essential. This group was awesome and can appeal to many different audiences.
0385510454|1.0|This is John Grisham at his worst and one of the most boring books I have ever read.  He spends way too much time on Italy history lessons and Italian language that have nothing to do with the story.  Take out the garbage and this book will be about 100 pages long at the most.  Grisham needs to stay with legal thrillers and stay away from political thrillers - he is way over his head here.
B00005JLT5|5.0|The rubric on the DVD I purchased stated that \\"This [...] film follows [the pianist's] journey of survival with the unlikely help of a sympathetic German officer\\". I had imagined that the pianist in question would have been playing in some kind of caf or bar throughout the five years that Warsaw was occupied by the Nazis, with this \\"sympathetic German officer\\" being a keen listener and showing his admiration for the pianist's marvelous playing abilities. <br /> <br />Whilst my speculation about the quasi-friendship was hopelessly wide of the mark, the last speculation was almost exactly on the spot, yet the officer (Thomas Kretschmann) sees the utterly scruffy, bedraggled and starving Szpilman (Adrien Brody) hiding in an attic in a devastated part of the Pole's home city barely weeks before the Germans retreated west before the advancing Soviets. <br /> <br />The state in which the officer found Szpilman conveyed in an unforgettable way the utter privations experienced by just one man in his bid to avoid being shot on sight, if not dragged off to the extermination camps, which would have happened earlier in the war had not one Polish Jewish policeman not physically dragged Szpilman out of the line of would-be deportees to Treblinka, since he knew who he was. <br /> <br />Seen from the perspective of one Jewish man, the Nazi policy regarding their treatment of the Jews is crystal-clear: ghettoization and extermination. Even the scenes depicting the so-called \\"Gentile street\\" running through the Jewish ghetto are powerful as a reminder of how physically cut off the Jews were from the rest of Varsovian society and of how utterly demoralized and ostracized the Jews were forced to feel as a people. How ironic, indeed, that a wall would divide the capital of the (then former) Nazi regime for 28 years, albeit along political, not racial, lines. <br /> <br />As might be expected, there are scenes designed deliberately to shock and appal - as well as remind the audience ofjust how brutally the Nazis, in the form of the S.S., treated the Jews. Who can forget the one where the old man is thrown to his death from his wheelchair from an upper floor of the building opposite where the Szpilmans were living, and the one where an S.S. man picked out people from a work party, which included Szpilman in its ranks, and summarily executed them. This illustrated just how hard-core Nazis dealt with  those whom Nazi racial theory regarded as the Untermenschen (\\"sub-humans\\"). <br /> <br />The conditions in which Szpilman found himself after escaping from the ghetto, destroyed in April 1943, were vastly different from before, as he found himself alone, having to live in a flat locked from the outside to avoid snoopers taking too close a look. When the Warsaw Uprising starts in August 1944, Szpilman is forced to run for his life and take refuge wherever he can as the Nazis snuff out all resistance, killing almost every Pole in sight. It was only at this point that the Kretschmann character, a captain in the army and not the S.S., helps him, but only after he manages to prove he is a pianist in spite of his utterly pathetic and miserable condition. Szpilman manages to survive the scenes of harrowing death and destruction, even if his benefactor was inevitably captured by the Soviet Army and fated to die in a POW camp. <br /> <br />Overall, \\"The Pianist\\" is as much an anti-war film as it is a war film, given that the aggressors had all the power at their disposal to do whatever they wished to their unarmed victims, although the will to fight on the part of the Jews is also highlighted, not just during the Uprising. Many of the film's scenes were shot not just in Warsaw, but also in two cities in Germany. The images are highly disturbing almost right from the very start, and that was the intention of Roman Polanski, who won the Academy Award for Best Director, for whom this movie was said to be \\"his most personal\\" on account of his own memories of war-torn Warsaw.  <br /> <br />Adrien Brody gives a performance which richly deserved his Academy Award for Best Actor, as he immerses himself in the character, sharing whatever joys and pain came both his way and the way of his relatives and friends, and stoically displaying the emotions that one would readily expect in such situations as Szpilman manages to survive, his life intact, ready to resume his career, albeit in a Poland that had been changed irrevocably. English actors Frank Finlay, Emilia Fox and Maureen Lipman co-star with Brody and give sterling performances.
B0007IPBD6|5.0|This album is everything a fan could want in a live CD! Great song choices, very emotional performance, and the songs get different takes in this live setting which makes the whole disc a treat! Definitely a five star disc if you are already a fan of Damien Rice!
B00005RZV4|5.0|WOW! Could this CD possibly be any better?? I think not. This is probably my favorite live cd I have EVER heard. Nine Inch Nails did an awesome job putting this CD together, every song flows into the next as though it were a concept album instead of a live recording, the intensity that resonates from this cd is awe-inspiring, everything about it is perfect Terrible Lie is the perfect song to open it with and Hurt is the perfect song to close it with. If you are new to Nine Inch Nails this would be an ideal introductory CD since it has songs from all 4 of their full length CDs. If you only own one Nine Inch Nails CD, make it this one, it is the pinnacle of their their musical revolution thus far.
B00064MW6A|3.0|Catwoman with Halley Berry is exactly what it should have been, a good \\"origin\\" movie. Unfortunately all the bad reviews will probably prevent a \\"Catwoman II\\", the movie most people were looking for.  <br /> <br />This was Catwoman's first time in the spotlight, how was your first date?
0446310786|5.0|\\"Classic\\" is a inadequate word when attemping to describe the moral values portrayed in thsi book. Set in a simpler more delicate time than any of us have lived, To kill a mockingbird is the scipture to live by. Comparably better than the bible, Harper's use of symbolism and veiled honorable demeanor are what we should be passing on to our children. An oasis in a world of lethargic ideals, this book is long awaited and well deserved guide of how one should conduct him or herself. \\"Delete the adjectives and you will have the facts\\" -Atticus
B00005JMAH|1.0|If this was the first Harry Potter movie, it might be worth a couple more stars.  Unfortunately, it was billed as the third in the series.  I'm sure that the egomaniac that directed this dissapointment feels that he has the true line into the soul of the books.  He might even be right but many of us who purchased this DVD expecting to be entertained for our dollars wasted our money.  The previous movies set a tone that was fun.  Maybe they went too far in that direction but they set a standard that has not been lived up to.  Change was inevitable and probably necessary as the tone of the books is changing.  The fact that the primary characters are growing up and the regrettable loss of Richard Harris all dictated changes.  The bottom line is that when I order a green shirt and get a red one, don't try to tell me that I'm color blind.  At least I can return the shirt. <br /> <br />I appreciate cinematography, special effects, staging and suspense created by a skillful director.  If that was what I wanted I could have bought any number of drama or horror movies that would have equaled the dark tone of this movie.  I feel ripped off, not because it's a bad movie but because it deviated from the reasonable expectation.  A clear victory for ego over predictable consistancy.  I happen to appreciate predictability.
B00030590I|4.0|I had heard about this film for a very long time and eagerly awaited its release in the United States. At last in 2004 it was in theaters, and I found it to be one of the most visually stunning movies I had ever witnessed. <br /> <br />The martial arts action was very exciting to watch. A nice blend between Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and The Matrix. But what really amazed me were all the colors and visual effects incorporated into the film that made it really stand out among all the others I've seen. <br /> <br />The plot can be a little complex for some to understand, but without giving too much away basically it is three different versions of the same story. The first version is told by the \\"hero\\" of the movie played by Jet Li. The second version is told by the Emperor who has summoned the \\"hero\\" to bestow upon him a reward for certain deeds accomplished. The third version is once again told by Jet Li's character. All three versions of this story are different, and in all three stories the same characters are dressed very differently to add even more distinction to them. <br /> <br />While the computer animation at times looks a little on the cheesy side, the rest of the action of the film makes up for it and is beautiful to watch. Filled with incredible images, cinematography, and martial arts, Hero delivers on many different levels.
0385335482|2.0|I liked Sophie Kinsella's \\"Can you Keep a Secret\\" as a matter of fact, I LOVED IT!<br /><br />but... this book was only a great disappointment... perhaps if i had read shopaholic before secret...<br /><br />I don't think anyone who is truly responsible with their money can stand the character, let's just say i'm not going to continue reading the other books... nothing in it happens, just her spending money and irresponsibly not thinking about all the bills she isn't paying... it's funny for the first few chapters but then... a great bore.
B0001DI0FI|1.0|I rented this movie for my son.  What a snoooooze fest.  There was no theme, no plot.  Just sailing about.  There were no characters to root for,  no story to follow.  I ended up picking up a book. The battle didn't make sence because they never addressed the issue of why? Then the battle was over as was the movie and I was left with .....WHY??? <br />The only mildy interesting thing was that the young officers were school aged boys without hope of sprouting facial hair anytime soon.  That one of these boys underwent a dramatic and  maiming event and walked away... was the only riviting tale.  It would have been interesting had they addressed the issue of why such young boys were sent to sea... as they were obviously blue-blooded chaps .  This sub plot was too short and vastly unexplored though. <br />If you want a good tale of the sea... try Finding Nemo, it is superior in everyway.
B000002AHC|5.0|This is the best collection of songs in modern history (excluding the bonus tracks). Recorded in late 1967 it was of course a commercial failure, sinking without a trace. I was 11 years old then and didnt even learn of its existence until 1975. <br />Importing a copy from the UK to NZ, eager to expand my insatiable desire for more Byrdsian sound, I was transformed by this album and I've never heard anything better since. What is it about this music? If anything, it's the atmosphere that was created, which sets the mind adrift from its moorings - you know you're experiencing something of great beauty. Possibly the production was a happy accident, with the band members far from harmonious (David Crosby fired though contributing to 3 songs), and with all the contemporary factors like the Vietnam War, Sergeant Pepper, Monterey, the jingle-gangle guitar 12 string style, Clarence white's guitar style, country music leanings, jazz, space music and production techniues such as phasing all thrown into the mix. Whatever the antecedents, the end result is a glorious magic carpet ride. Who needs drugs when we have this type of ecstasy available. Which leads me to track 1 (Artificial Energy), a song about amphetamines, introduced with horns and perhaps the most Sgt Pepper influenced song. Song 2 is a cover of Goffin/King's Goin Back. It's a great song in its own right, but here, the production is simply pure Byrdsian magic and it frames the theme of innocence and wisdom very very well. Song 3 and its Chris Hillman with one of his best compositions Natural Harmony. Whatever the cause of this idyllic state, the structure of the song is great with the bridge and chorus both hook laden, and indeed which is which? Draft Morning is so real it sends a shiver down my spine. Like the whole album, it is suberbly lyrically understated. The 1-5 1-3 harmonies are ethereal, the instrumental variation visceral. And what a great subject for a song. It could never be bettered. Wasn't born to follow had been released on the Easy Rider soundtrack. It's Goffin/King again, has a country feel and is an immaculate production from go to whoa, with an excellent phased instrumental break. The old side one finishes with Get to you, and has McGuinn stamped all over it and seems to be in 5/4 time. Again, the chorus is like a take off, getting you right in the guts. Amazing. Change Is Now starts the old side 2. Change is a common theme to the mid sixties and while the direction the theme takes here is a mystery, again we are dealing with a sonic delight - being taken fron jingle -jangle magic in the verse to country guitar in the chorus. The country feel continues in Old John Robertson, a nostalgic piece by Chris Hillman that transmogrifies into a baroque instrumental before phasing into verse three. Very cool. Tribal Gathering is 5/4 again and although the tune is minimalistic, the song is again superbly atmospheric and leads into another Crosby song Dolphins Smile. These songs are short - this one's only 2 minutes - but in that time - man - you are carried away. You're in the ocean and it's a beautiful place. Again the instrumental is jaw dropping with its change of key and use of high tech instrumentation. The last track Space Odyssey I found disappointing when I first heard it but I've grown to accept it as part of history. It lacks the compositional clout of the previous songs and at the time I thought something like Lady Friend would have been much better. Anyway it's 4 mins of repetition and brings the original album to a close. Of the bonus tracks, Triad is the most interesting and also could have sonically fitted onto the original album nicely. However thematically it doesn't perhaps fit in with the other tracks. So if this is the world number one, what comes after? Rubber Soul, Gaucho, Mr Tambourine Man, Another side of Bob Dylan, Help and the Hissing of Summer Lawns . . .
0395925037|5.0|The book is obviously a must read for understanding Hitler's early thought.  But, as many of his associates would attest, he himself declared the book obsolete, irrelvant, poorly written and he regretted publishing it (which is why he never published his second book).  Most high ranking National Socialists never read it, with the exception of Goebbels.  The book probably has more emotional impact on people today than it did back then, and I personally don't understand how it's now become so significant to neo-nazis and censors.  The book would probably be more useful to historian types than to the general reader.  The prose is turgid and disorganized, and definitely seems to simply be rant put to paper (it's not simply the translation, the German edition is the same way).  The book is also difficult to read all the way through.  The chapter on propaganda is proably the most useful one, and is the only here where Hitler shows his brilliant understanding of persuasion.  Most of the book is still filled with his typical perorations with his pseudoscientific, somewhat simplistic understanding of things (although he probably read more than most people).  Despite his intelligence, most of this book is by no means a masterpiece, especially given many of his problematic beliefs.  For insight into Hitler's mind, his second book would be a better read, but even more important would be his 'secret conversations'.  It's definitely a worthwhile read for us serious students of history, just like the Communist Manifesto, but otherwise I would pass, as I think it's significance has been way overblown. I nonetheless gave it a five for it's significance as a historical text, but without that, I would have given it a 2 or a 1.
6305718954|5.0|The movie did a commendable job in getting across what Jesus' message was to mankind:  That the \\"church\\" is all around you and more than a building, either fancy or plain, and a bureaucracy of men. A bureacracy that not only reads His Word to the flock but forms \\"its\\" opinion (not His) of what He intended us to learn from His coming and then in effect voices this opinion to the flock as  His Word. <br /> <br />I frequently ask myself this question when the organized religions, governments, etc.  take a position or action on some matter, be it war, be it same-sex marriage, be it \\"Holy War\\", be it the Crusades, be it the Inquisition,  etc. etc.: \\"If Jesus were a man(or woman) and if He was here today, would He behave this way and want us to behave this way?\\"  The answer I always come to is \\"NO\\".  The Jesus I've read about is a loving and forgiving Diety - not a \\"fire and brimstone Tyrant\\" nor a \\"picky benevolent Diety\\". In today's world, He would be The Expert on Compassion, Forgiveness, Tolerance and everything Else that is good and right.  <br /> <br />If the Stigmata and the Jesus Scriptures truly exist, then this will be a threat to most of the religious bureaucracies throughout the world. It will also be a threat to those governments and those leaders that proclaim their actions are in accordance with and necessary under \\"Gods Laws\\" and in accordance with \\"Allah's wishes\\" and all the other references to our Divine Creator to justify their positions and actions. <br /> <br />And, those institutions - be they a \\"Church\\" or a \\"government\\" or some \\"other\\" and the individuals who believe the \\"word\\" of those institutions, will not only find themselves subject to judgement the same as the rest of mankind, but they will also be subject to judgement on the consequences of their actions taken and in justifying their actions in the Name of The Father, Son, Holy Ghost, Jesus, Allah, and Others. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00005JMXX|1.0|This movie was very unresalistic.  Here's why <br />1.  What was the Dennis Quaid character going to do when he got to the library? <br />2.  The Dennis Quaid character walked 40 miles in -400 degree weather. <br />3.  The Oil Tanker can navigate through a city under water? <br />4.  There is NO WAY a storm that big can form in three days.  Everything we saw in the movie would happen over millions of years, no days. <br />5.  When the ice storm chased the Dennis Quaid character into the building, he started a small fire.  Wouln't the fire suck up all the air? <br />6.  The fire wasn't big enough to survive the ice storm in the first place. <br />7.  The President of the United Sates just leaves half the country to freeze (I know this was adressed in the movie but he made up his mind fast).
B000002LRX|5.0|I think this is the best album from FNM ever. The first big favour they did was to get Chuck Moosley kicked out becos it was obviously Mike Patton that made this band happened! FNM started the Rap/Funk/Metal rock sound that stick todate.  And I wouldn't agree the least that they got this idea from Red Hot Chilli Pepper. Oh please.... it was Patton who spotted this style (of singing & music) long before Kiedis did.  And long before Axl Rose wore a kilt, Patton had done it first. <br />As for the music, I think all of them are good. Mike Bordin's different drum sound showed his talent alot.  Jim was very good too.  I think all of them (incl Patton) are versatile.  You would hear diff styles of sound on every songs which made this album very interesting.  As always, FNM delivered their ideas and talent very well.  It's such a waste that they couldn't see eye to eye anymore that they had to be disbanded anyhow. Hmmm.... But I still hope that they'll get back together someday becos I believe their fans out there like me are ever waiting for that.  Kudos to those who bought this and the other albums of FNM!!!
B0002XDODU|1.0|Ok.  Give me a chance to explain the one star rating.  This band, Rammstein, is an amazing band.  Their first two albums were amazing, industrial greatness.  Love them to death.  Then Mutter came out, good cd, slightly different direction, but still good.    Then this came out.    I heard Mein Teil and i got scared.    I heard Amerika and was relieved.    ....then i heard the rest of the album and cried.    I'm sorry, but looking back at their previous efforts and then listening to this would make anyone cry.  Anyone who truly loves the old Rammstein cds should run far away from this before it's too late.    The cd is bland, all the songs sound the same.  There is no real energy on this cd, as there was in the past.  And Rammstein has basically thrown all their industrial roots out the window on this one as well.  Yet a lot of band i've been listening to have done that (i.e. orgy, zeromancer, godhead, all had watered down albums compared to previous efforts, however their new albums were good tho)  this is just horrible.    i'm sorry rammstein.  please forgive me.  but i had to do this.  i had to warn people.  i know some will be mad at me for this review, and you will automatically say this review didnt help you, even thought you own the cd and simply disagree with me...but you can't honestly give this cd a 4 or 5 star rating after listening to their older cds.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|'Once' completes the transition of Century Child - which is sad news. Tuomas takes out Tarja's opera element, and after this CD kicks her out completely. No doubt he'll regret that the rest of his life (like the way he kicked out Sami).<br /><br />+ Some songs are just beautiful like Nemo, Creek Mary's Blood, Ghost Love Score<br />+ The orchestra epics make me think he really will compose a movie's soundtrack one day<br />- But no real classics. Lots of bass, noise. I ended up deleting everything but the orchestra single versions.<br />- Tuomas admits that success takes its toll, and theres a 'loss of innocence' in his music. Theres no longer the mystery and adventure that makes ocean souls. This CD can be easily ignored next to its precedents.
B000002UB3|5.0|NO OTHER HUMAN ROCK GROUP WILL EVEN COME CLOSE <br />TO CAPTURING THE EMOTION ON THIS ALBUM. <br />MOZART, BEETHOVEN ARE MERE DUST IN COMPARISON. <br />IT IS PROBABLY THE BEST BEATLES ALBUM,  <br />ALTHOUGH THE WHITE ALBUM AND LET IT BE  <br />COME VERY CLOSE...... <br /> <br />IT IS A GREAT PITY HOWEVER THAT ALTHOUGH THE ROLLING STONES HAVE REMASTERED ALL OF THEIR ALBUMS, AS HAVE 99% OF 60s/70s MUSIC, <br />YET THE BEATLES ORIGINAL COLLECTION OF ALBUMS DOES NOT HAVE EVEN ONE REMASTER. <br /> <br />TO TRY AND COMPENSATE FOR THIS, THE VOLUME HAS TO BE CRANKED UP, THE  <br />SRS-WOW AND THE DFX-AUDIO ENGAGED, JUST TO LISTEN TO THIS MUSIC ON MODERN CD PLAYERS.  <br />AND AT A SOUND QUALITY THAT COMES A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE MODERN CD QUALITY OF TODAYS CDs. <br />BUT REMASTERS DO WORK WITHOUT SACRILLIGE TO THE ORIGINAL. <br />JUST CHECK OUT THE LATEST REMASTER OF THE DOORS ALBUM  <br />'LA WOMAN' AND SEE.  <br />IT CAN BLOW A ROOM APART AND YET IT IS EXACTLY THE SAME AS THE ORIGINAL IN ITS SOUND............ <br /> <br /> <br />
B00062ZE3U|2.0|After WT dropped their growls and made 'Mother Earth', I thought this band had something going for them. But success always takes a toll. Please sample this album before wasting the time and money for so little return. Expect easy tunes, refrain repetition, synthesized voice, stupid lyrics, and the new pop culture look that goes with commercial sellouts.<br /><br />I feel rather guilty for trusting WT to master their potential, and can only imagine their first ex-fans as saying, \\"Told ya so.\\"
B00005JLEX|5.0|Finally, Seinfeld on DVD! But not just the episodes (uncut of course),but packed with tons of special features such as deleted scenes, outtakes and bloopers. Plus scenes from the Tonight Show, commentaries and how it all began. It seems now a days, studios want to rush things out on DVD and make the fast buck, skimping out on all the extras. Not this set though. My one single complaint about the set: I wished they would have printed the DVD disc number on the spine of the DVD Case. Minuet I know, but it's a pain to pull them all out each time to figure which disc I want. Definitely worth the purchase if your into Seinfeld.
B000683VI4|5.0|I'm not into the girlie movies that always end up w/ the girl getting her prince charming but this film really got to me and left me craving for more.  Something about the pure raw emotion displayed in Noah and his undying love, that's what every little girl hopes to find in her life! I've already pre-ordered my copy.
0783225849|5.0|When Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), feeling powerless in an affair with a married man, Sam Loomis (John Gavin), impulsively steals forty thousand dollars from her boss and leaves town, she is pursued by guilt and the police, finally ending up at a motel run by shy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) - who is apparently under the thumb of his invalid mother - and then dead in the shower.  This is the premise of Alfred Hitchcock's most famous movie, PSYCHO.  When PSYCHO was first released in 1960, it was loved by audiences but scorned by critics as a shabby shocker.  Since then, PSYCHO has won the respect of critics while remaining wildly popular with the general public.  There is good reason for this.  The movie's scenes are concisely written.  It was made on a low budget, yet the gritty look of the film fits the sordid nature of the subject matter, and the gifted cast dominates.  Bernard Herrmann's electrifying, all-strings score is one of the greatest in all film, conveying most of the movie's emotional subtext.  PSYCHO's famous set piece, the \\"shower scene,\\" shocks even today (and all the more for its restraint - that is, what it DOESN'T show), from Marion's delight at stepping under the spray (symbolically washing away her error), to the entrance of the knife, to the blood running down the drain, to the final shot of her lifeless body and staring eye.  Janet Leigh's performance as Marion is one of those perfect film portrayals, from post-tryst beginning to tragic end.  (Marion's life was brutally ended before she could repair her mistake, as she had resolved to; this is why her death is a tragedy.)  Because Anthony Perkins became typecast as \\"Norman Bates,\\" it would be easy to overlook the intensity of his acting in this first version of PSYCHO (there were three sequels).  Watch his smoldering eyes when Marion suggests that he put his mother in \\"a madhouse,\\" or his disgusted reaction on finding Marion's body - one would think that he had nothing to do with her murder.  Martin Balsam makes the absolute most of his sixteen minutes of screen time as Milton Arbogast, the private detective called in to investigate Marion's disappearance.  His questioning of Norman is one of the most remarkable things I have ever seen in a movie, sounding almost completely improvised.  Vera Miles plays Lila, Marion's sensible but brave sister who, together with Sam, investigates the mystery following Arbogast's (literal) downfall.   It has been said that PSYCHO is unusual because its (sympathetic) female lead is killed off forty-five minutes into the action.  I would add that PSYCHO is unique because it starts off as a psychological study of theft and guilt, then becomes a murder mystery and finally, in its last scenes, a Freudian examination of a psychopath.
B00030590I|4.0|This is a class of movies I've learned to like. It features great fight scenes and wire work, but with a clearly non-western flavor. There's always a mystical, even magical edge that western movies can't capture with a straight face.<br /><br />This one offers more than most. It describes a set of encounters between Nameless, the Hero, and assassins that had tried to take down the empire-building king. In a unique bit of visual story-telling, it goes over those encounters again and again. Each telling is changed by a different bit of spin-doctoring, to the point that the viewer may give up all hope of knowing the truth (whatever that means) of the original encounters. This could have been very confusing, except that each telling is color-coded. By themselves, the tinted stories are visually appealing. As a set they work very nicely. The one constant through all but the first interlude is Moon, loyal retainer to one of the assassins.<br /><br />Good action/adventure with a little more depth than a comparable movie from the West, and people generally keep their clothes on. The good guy wins in the end, but you'll have to find out for yourself what that means.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B00003CWL6|5.0|I rented American Beauty and I expected to be horribly offended at the father's infatuation with the young girl. When the movie came out I was fifteen and the idea of someone's father lusting after me made me want to gag, however that was only a small part of the story, the rest of it was absolutely spell binding. <br />Usually when I watch movies I knit, because I like to do two things at once but I could not get over how involved I was in the movie and the characters and how everything was not like it seemed. <br />Annette Bening was fabulous as the controlling mother who had to have everything go her way but was really falling apart. I like the how Mendes showed how their marriage was falling apart because she was so obsessed with material things. Wes Bentley had some beautiful lines and Chris Cooper was stellar because he always is. The acting and writing was top notch as was the directing. I loved how there were mainly three colors used, black, white, and red. There are other colors obviously but those were the main three and they were used exceptionally well. <br />I grew up in suburbia and I can attest things are not idyllic but they are not as melodramatic as this story was. I think the point was to show that people in the suburbs feel they have to hide their dissapointment and they lie to cover it up in disgusting shameless ways. The cinematography was gorgeous as well. <br />Reading other reviews many people who had problems with this film had issues with the homosexuality, which ironically was a small part of the film and not offensive as a man lusting after a girl the same age as his daughter. I do not think the moral of the film was \\"let's all be gay and let's hate American values\\" it was to mainly look closer at a sterile place where everything was \\"perfect and living the American dream\\" and realize that no place is perfect and to appreciate beauty in flawed things-ie Wes Bentley's character and Kevin Spacey. I personally think that is a beautiful moral and that this is a beautiful and engaging film.
B0000AFX64|4.0|I never watched \\"Battlestar Galactica\\" as a kid. \\"Buck Rogers\\" and \\"V\\" were sci-fi shows that I dug, but not \\"Galactica\\". However, with the recent release of the Sci-Fi Channel's new rendering of the show and the hype it is causing in certain circles I run in, I thought it might be interesting to at least get a taste of what the show was about. Ergo, the two hour theatrical release of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA. The movie is actually a condensed version of the original three-hour premiere of the series. Though there are a few obvious moments where a trained eye can tell where the commercial breaks were at, the editors did a good job of condensing the television show's plot into a theatrical film.<br /><br />In an unknown period of time thousands of years into the future the 12 colonies (planets) of man are on the verge of signing a peace treaty with a race of robots known as the Cylons. Humans and the Cylons have been at war for over a 1,000 years and most everyone believes the dawning of a new era has arrived. Except, the Cylons have no intention of making peace. They want the complete and total annihilation of the human race. Using a human traitor who is the right hand man of the President. The Cylons succeed in wiping out most of the human fleet, including 11 Battlestars, and almost all of the population of the 12 colonies. Commander Adama operates the sole remaining Battlestar, Galactica, and had a hunch the Cylons were up to no good. Under his quick thinking and guidance, almost all of the survivors on each of the colonies are gathered up and together the leave for the mysterious 13th colony in a galaxy far away, called Earth. In the second half of the film, Battlestar Galactica reaches a somewhat distant planet run by fly-like creatures who run a secret resort. All the food, women (or men), wine, and song are at their disposal. The resort seems like a paradise, but there is a darkness on the planet. Adama feels it and thinks the Cylons are involved somehow. A major act of disception is incorporated and the adventure really begins.<br /><br />When it aired, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA was described as being STAR WARS meets WAGON TRAIN and in many ways that's what it is. The special effects were created under the supervision of John Dykstra, who worked on STAR WARS. There is a lot of similarities between GALACTICA and STAR WARS, for example the Cylons are ruled by an Imperious Leader who looks an awful lot like the Emperor in STAR WARS. There's a lot of cheesy costumes and set design, not to mention some of the acting, aka Dirk Benedict as Starbuck. Still the film does have its moments and Lorne Greene makes the film seem more relevant than it really is. I'm thinking about renting the whole series DVD just to see what the rest of the show was like.isception is incorporated and the adventure really begins.

B00001QEE7|5.0|When I was four the movie was release in theaters. My Mom took me to see it and I just remember thinking it was the best movie ever. I think most women my age 18-21 would say that this was their favorite movie as a little girl. It had music, magic, and a princess we loved and adored. It was truly everything a four year old could ask for in a movie. I really can not watch this movie without a sentimental viewpoint. My favorite character was Ariel and I loved how fiesty she was. Many girls my age tried to use a \\"dinglehopper\\" and brush their hair. I just think that if I had a little girl I would love to watch it with her and experience the magic of it all over again.

0446677450|3.0|If you read Rich kid Smart kid, you would believe me when i say that it is very similar to Rich Dad Poor Dad. Rich dad poor dad teaches individuals the requirements of becoming rich. It's a book that not only teaches indivduals how to become rich, it teaches individuals how to have money work for them. <br />One lesson I liked from this book, was the teaching of discipline. Learning to control your emotion of fear and desire. <br />I give this book a thumb's down on the redundancy. <br />The author in my opinion, wrote this book up with a lot of redundant statements. But other than that, this book is a good tool for people that knows nothing of finance and investment.
0440224764|3.0|The book started out fairly well. It was an interesting read, and a fairly good book... until the ending.<br /><br />The ending was awful, and came out of nowhere. There is nothing in the book suggesting this kind of ending could take place. Plus, a lot of the different sub-plots in the book never came together and the ending left the reader hanging on those.<br /><br />The plot is fairly simple. A partner in a law firm, Patrick, fakes his death and runs off with $90 million. They track him down and torture him, but can't get the money because a girl is hiding the money, and not Patrick. Patrick goes to jail, but things get interesting when he starts showing evidence that the money maybe been obtained illegally...<br /><br />One will enjoy reading this book for the most part, although the start is a little slow. However, the ending will ruin the entire book.

B000068OSK|4.0|I initially didn't really care for this album and thought all the tracks sounded the same, but after a few more listens I really got into this album, although I still prefer De Stijl or Elephant to this album.  There are some classics on this cd as well, like The Big Three Killed My Baby, Stop Breakin' Down, I Fought Piranhas, Wasting My Time, Astro, Suzy Lee, Jimmy the Exploder, and Sugar Never Tasted So Good.  That's nine songs and I probably forgot some other ones, but overall a very solid album.
B0006IIPIK|2.0|I looked forward with great anticipation to seeing \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow\\" after having read mostly glowing reviews from the critics.  Alas, I was disappointed in this film.  While it is beautiful to look at, \\"Sky Captain\\" has no soul.<br /><br />The storyline is mostly a conglomeration of movie serials and landmark films from the 1920s and 1930s, and there are many none-too-subtle homages to Metropolis, King Kong, Buck Rodgers, and even a small tip of the hat to Godzilla (one must look closely to see the latter).  There are also influences from 1950s films; the giant robots bear a striking resemblance to the machine from the film \\"Kronos\\", complete with antenna, circular radio waves and sound.<br /><br />The actors are of quality background, but something is missing in terms of chemistry between the two principals.  Sky Captain (Jude Law) flies around in a souped-up P-40 Warhawk fighter plane, and is joined in his adventures by Ace Reporter Polly Perkins (Gwyeth Paltrow).  Polly spends most of the film whining about this or that, and Paltrow seems a bit overwhelmed by all the bluescreens; perhaps this is because she has not worked in this kind of film before, while Law did extensive duty in an effects-loaded \\"A.I. Artificial Intelligence\\".  These two have worked together before (The Talented Mr. Ripley) with excellent results, but there is no real warmth between them in this film.  Angelina Jolie appears all too briefly as the British commander of a sort of flying aircraft carrier.<br /><br />The production design and extensive CGI effects are truly amazing, with art-deco elements throughout.  In this respect the film is a work of art, with film noir lighting even in what is supposed to be broad daylight.  One major glitch in the film in light of this is the fact that Polly takes photos in caves, deep shadows, etc. without any semblance of a flash-filmmakers who specialize in such things as lighting should certainly know better.<br /><br />Overall \\"Sky Captain\\" does have a unique look about it; I can't say I've seen a modern movie that captures the visual essence of the 1920/30s like this film does.  However, the plot is far too convoluted (simple plots being the basis of the old serials), and some of the actors seem overwhelmed by the CGI technology.  Their chops suffer somewhat as a result.  2 stars for technical achievment.e look about it; I can't say I've seen a modern movie that captures the visual essence of the 1920/30s like this film does.

B0001BKAEY|2.0|Nothing to say about Matrix 2 & 3, but just the pleasure to see again (and for the last time, as she decided) the beautiful and enigmatic Canadian actress Carrie Ann Moss, and feel very sorry about her death, however I think she preferred to die before keep running in this nonsense techno-digital-effects race.  <br />The sequence I enjoyed the most, because the implicit humor and human feelings: Monica Belluci and Carrie fighting about kissing Keanu Reeves. What a lucky man.  <br />From the legitimate questions about human future of the first film, a few are left in the second, and none in the third. <br />

0060594888|5.0|I am the kind of person who can't succeed. I can't apply Jack Canfield's principles. I don't look to bother people and so I cannot ask them repeatedly for something. I often am mixed up as to what I want, and don't really focus on one goal. If I do get ahead a bit I feel sorry for all those who do not , and want to not succeed. I don't care to be rich and have a lot of money. What I would sort of like to do is help people feel that even though they are old, ugly, stupid, and failures they are still human beings worthy of consideration and kindness. I guess I am just a big old failure who will never get anywhere . Nonetheless it is nice to know that there are principles of success and some people can use them and become rich and happy. As for the poor jerks like me I guess that we will have to be content wallowing in our failures , and wondering why we can't be so successful as all the really successful people are.
B0001UL7RY|1.0|After reading multiple reviews on artists such as Britney Spears, Hillary Duff, Ashlee Simpson, and Christina Aguilara, there seem to be many misguided fans who rate their albums 5 stars. There are very talented songwriters and background vocalists, out there that deserve the credit these marketing figureheads are getting. <br /> <br />Many other amazon users might believe I am misguided myself by mentioning pop-culture's biggest stars in writing a review for the obviously talented Avril Lavigne. Afterall, Avril Lavigne seems to be the new idol for all those angst-ridden teenagers who need to find a valid star to look up to now that grunge is obviously a thing of the past. And in all public appearances, interviews, and music videos Avri Lavigne seems to be the big ticket. <br /> <br />A certain review of this album written by Megan (Meggie), states, \\"The lyrics are nice too, and in this album she plays a varietly of instruments (acoustic guitar, piano, sings) which is one more star for Avril!!\\" Meggie, aside from a hasty review ridden with mistakes, seems to believe Avril Lavigne plays the instruments listed.  <br /> <br />I am not one to correct misguided teenagers, but I find it amusing, that after Avril fights so hard to maintain a punk-rock image, she wasn't familiar with The Sex Pistols. Sum 41, who she is an outspoken fan of, just collaborated with Ludicrous, far from punk-rock sensibilities. She has contradicted herself in multiple interviews about her ability to play guitar, the proof of which is in every live performance. I could count the number of chords she knows how to play on my crippled 3 finger hand. Avril's songwriting ability has obviously grown since her dependence on songwriters, The Matrix, who are reknowned writers of the music of Hillary Duff and Celine Dion. But according to ASCAP she is indeed not completely self-reliant when it comes to songwriting. <br /> <br />Before becoming a nationally reknowned punk allstar, Avril was a rising star inCanada singing country tunes. She even shared the stage once with Shania Twain. How punk-rock is that?!?! <br /> <br />My last proof comes directly from amazon.com itself. If you see the artists listed for customers who bought Avril's albums, you will notice names like, Britney Spears, Christina Aguilara, Michelle Branch, and Hillary Duff, among others. So congratulations Avril, your customers are obviously as punk and angst ridden as you. Or maybe just a little misguided.
0316172324|4.0|What I love most about all these reviews available in Amazon is that many diverge from the book appraised and those diversion have led me to some wonderful books: \\"The Bamboo Chest\\"! Thank you to \\"Tome\\" for your other recommendation. It's a great accompaniament to \\"Blink\\"! While \\"The Bamboo Chest\\" is more backed up by declassified documents from the Defense Intelligence Agency and the State Department and excellent writing style(catch some of those gems!), \\"Blink\\" is carried along by the strength of the vignettes and the author's clear understanding of a very innate (and important!) ability: interesting how even on this review list how much those belief patterns we all have, whether in favour or against, have defined the direction of the review. Such is the controversy of books like \\"Blink\\" and \\"The Bamboo Chest\\": I say get the book, read it and if you don't like it, as I've experienced with other books purchased from Amazon, resell it. But for this book, for what it delivers I say get it and keep it, refer to it as your life experience changes!
B00005JKG9|5.0|Al Pacino (People I Know, Looking For Richard), Jack Lemmon (The Odd Couple, Out To Sea), Ed Harris (The Human Stain, Just Cause), Alec Baldwin (The Aviator, The Cooler), Alan Arkin (Grosse Pointe Blank, The Jerky Boys Movie), Kevin Spacey (Se7en, Beyond The Sea) and Jonathan Pryce (Pirates Of The Caribbean, Ronin) act their asses off in tense and powerful performances. Pacino, Lemmon, Harris, Arkin and Spacey all work as salesmen and they have to sell leads to get big mucho money by the next day or their fired...that's what the dynamic Baldwin says to them...he has everything and they dont...he doesnt like losers. So, the gang embark on selling the leads that they have and if the others dont, most of them get canned in the end. Harris and Arkin devise a plan or stealing the good leads for themselves...share them. The next day, they all come to work and find out that the place has been robbed...the contracts and leads and even the phones are all gone. A detective questions them all as the tension builds up as the actors bicker and banter on one another. Who stole the leads? A superb array of characters with the actors channeling their brilliant talents to them....Pacino is pulsating as the offfice hotshot...Lemmon hits the mark as the office loser....Arkin and Harris deliver as well and Spacey is riveting as the boss. Jonathan Pryce has a nice role as one of Pacino's clients. The dialouge rolls off the screen like firecrackers in true David Mamet style. A masterpiece. I recommend it highly. Directed by James Foley (The Corrupter, Fear)
B0000024IE|5.0|When I first bought this I really couldn't get into it. It just seemed so incoherent and messy but then gave it a few more listens and then a few more and finally seemed to gel together. The only gripes I have now is that 911 Is A Joke was covered by Duran Duran ( no one really wants to hear that ). But the thicker the beats, the rhymes and all make this all the more a delicious album to get into. And besides who can resist Fight The Power. (...)
0792846338|5.0|James Caan, Richard Farnsworth, and Kathy Bates star in this thrilling adaptation of Stephen King's excellent novel.  Caan stars as Paul Sheldon, a very successful author of the \\"Misery Chastain\\" series of books.  After finishing his latest installment of his series, he sets off to deliver the manuscript to his editor.  Unfortunately, he encounters a terrible snowstorm, and his car slides off the road and over a cliff.  He is trapped inside with numerous injuries and unable to escape.    Fortunately for Paul, Annie Wilkes (Bates) comes along and pries his car door open with a crowbar and frees him.  Annie takes Paul to her house to nurse him back to health.  As Paul is beginning to convalesce, Annie reveals that she is his \\"number one fan\\", and has read every book in the Misery series several times over.  She also has authgraphed pictures of Paul throughout her house.  At first, Paul is flattered by Annie's kindness, but he also suspects something is wrong with this good samaritan.    Annie also managed to retrieve Paul's manuscript from the wreckage, and she begs Paul to let her read it.  After a while, he relents.  But after reading it, Annie goes completely nuts because Paul has killed off Misery.  Paul now realizes that Annie is insane and the only way for him to survive is to give in to her wishes and write a new novel which brings Misery back to life.    Meanwhile, the local sheriff (Farnsworth) has become aware of Paul's disappearance and has begun an investigation into his whereabouts.    Paul continues to work on his new novel and as he writes, he's realizing that he's creating his best work yet.  However, he still has Annie to deal with.  He's continually locked up in his room, but he does manage to unlock his door by using a paper clip in the lock.  He discovers many things about Annie, including her scrapbook, which has newpaper clippings implicating her in a hospital baby death scandal.    Unfortunately for Paul, Annie figures out that he has been out of his room, and she takes measures to ensure he won't leave again, courtesy of a piece of wood and a large sledgehammer.  Will Paul be able to escape?  Will the sheriff uncover the truth about Annie before its too late?    This is an excellent movie.  The plot is thrilling and will keep you on edge throughout the movie.  James Caan and Richard Farnsworth give solid performances, but Kathy Bates is truly the star of this film.  Her portrayal of the obsessed \\"number one fan\\" is impeccable.  She won the Academy Award for her performance in this movie.  I highly recommend this thrilling and suspenseful film.  Watch and see how one person's admiration of another can turn into a fatal obsession.
B0000C7PQK|5.0|<br />If you are an Enigma fan, this is a must-have CD. I absolutely loved it. There are several tracks that I cannot stop listening to. The only thing that I did not like was that I felt that they didn't put enough tracks in this CD. I kind of felt that they could have put more effort bringing in more tracks into the CD. After all, they don't push out CDs as frequently as other bands.
B0000C7PSW|5.0|It took me a while to get on board with Rufus. I first heard him at a concert in NYC-- I was on a date with a girl who's obsessed with him. My first impression was that his voice sounded a little nasally and whiny and that he was extremely flamboyant.<br /><br />When I got home, though, I couldn't get \\"Vibrate\\" out of my head (not the best song on the album, but certainly a catchy one). I decided to order Want One mostly as a souvenir of my date, but also because something about these songs stuck with me.<br /><br />When the CD came, I liked it, and Rufus's sound, more and more with each listen. Every song is beautifully crafted, with distinctive and beautiful melodies, and rich orchestration. I even came to appreciate and enjoy his voice, the way one might grow to love coffee or the opera.<br /><br />Now that I have all of his CDs, this is probably still my favorite, although I think the others would take a little less getting used to.<br /><br />Want One opens with an amazing song, \\"Oh What a World,\\" which just layers on level after level of sound onto a baseline played, I think, by a tuba (or something synthesized to sound like one). The whole thing has a hypnotic effect.<br /><br />Other particularly beautiful songs are \\"Natasha,\\" \\"Pretty Things,\\" and \\"I Don't Know What It Is.\\"<br /><br />I'm sure there's a certain type of person who really loves this kind of music, but I didn't think I was one of them until I really absorbed it. If your first impression of this CD is mixed or worse, give it a second and third chance. It's worth the effort.
B0002ZDVEU|4.0|If it's action and suspense that you want, you'll get both in spades, with a \\"knock your socks off\\" cast and script. The car chase near the end of the movie, while gripping and exciting to watch, defies plausibility but doesn't detract from the suspense or the quality of the movie. Well worth watching for action aficionados and those who enjoy thrillers. Overall, 4+ stars.
B000002UAU|5.0|Sgt. Peppers Lonely Hearts Club Band, released in 1967, was right dead in the middle of what critics call the most ingenious period of The Beatles' creativity. <br />This album proves that point, as what they had released as a step in a \\"new direction\\" has now become a staple in music history. This album showcases the many ranges of styles that the \\"fab four\\" could touch, and definitely still presents itself well 30 years after it's initial release. <br />[...] <br /> <br />
B0000C1733|4.0|I am new to listening to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and I was surprised that \\"Can't Stop\\" was not featured on the greatest Hits CD. Whenever I tune into my radio station I usually hear that song and personally I feel it is one of their best, certainly outranking some of the songs that the band put on the CD. I Don't know some of the songs didn't seem to be great at all.

'How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb' is an album that fell on critical acclaim... so why are there so many bad reviews here? Because critics are AFRAID of saying what they really think about U2... & they shouldn't be... but the fans & reviewers here have no credibility to lose... thats why on these reviews, the truth comes out - I've hardly ever seen so many 1 star reviews for an album    The corporate whores U2 have turned into are disgusting... it's so hard to imagine this was once a \\"band for the people\\"... theyre not anymore, thats for sure - U2 is a band for Apple commercials, superbowls, and their record company...    U2 lost their way somehow, I'm not sure what it was that caused this... but the songs on How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb lack of any convincing emotion, & the experimentation is zero... usually when bands make the same albums twice, critics flame them for it, so why should U2 be different? they shouldnt...     this album is boring, & was made for the grammys... what it wasnt made for, were music lovers that appreciate effort & diversity.
B00005ASHM|4.0|OK, so \\"Pet Sounds\\" isn't the greatest LP ever.  So what? <br /> <br />Nearly 40 years after its release, it endures as a benchmark against which all other American albums of its era may be judged.  Predating \\"The Summer of Love\\" and the over-electrification of rock music, \\"Pet Sounds\\" is a marvel of production excellence, tight harmonies, and the kind of laid back West Coast sound that recalls a simpler time. <br /> <br />I loved it as a teenager.  My kids love it as teenagers.  The reason?  Universal themes that are easily accessible and understandable. <br /> <br />No, there's scarce in the way of lyrics with hidden meaning or Eastern Mysticism here.  Just good, old American rock 'n' roll. <br /> <br />For that, I, for one, am grateful.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|This album is actually underrated, and is a good record.  The only tracks that are really weak are Enter the Arena/Crush'em.  The rest of the songs are pretty strong.  A true Megadeth fan should like this.  This was my last Megadeth album to get because I thought it was going to suck like many say it does... it really doesnt!  True, its not a Rust In Peace, but its good on its own. Its a lot more \\"alternative\\" than any other Megadeth album out there.  It may take some time to get used to.  Its just a matter of taste.  If you just want the heavy thrash metal, dont look here.  Its very experimental and doesnt try to ever really be a heavy metal record.  Thats what I personally love about it.  So, if you can handle your metal being slightly \\"poppier\\" and more alternative than this is for you. Give it a try.
B0002X314C|5.0|He could fit right in in 1970.  The comparisons to Stevie and Donny are apt, but he also has some Bobby Womack and Maxwell sounds too.  My favorite track is So High - it's just beautiful. Used to Love U is slammin' with it's latin flavor. He sounds so sexy on Alright. Snoop Dogg ruined I Can Change for me. Refuge and Live It Up are my other favorites.  Watch out John, here comes Grammy.
B0002EXH4A|5.0|This is an awesome metal masterpiece.  You can tell that the whole band had to be on drugs though.  Theres no getting around that.  This is just as good as Peace Sells, and a little better!  All the songs are very thrashy and heavy.  Any Megadeth fan should know its a classic.  If you are just getting into the band, I WOULD recommend it due to the fact of the musical greatness, kickass(sometimes weird) lyrics, and overall a damn fine metal record.
0440224764|5.0|SPOILERS included (added this line Jan 2009)<br /><br />I always enjoy the 'reading' of Grisham's novel and this one does not disappoint.  I expect to hate Grisham's ending and this one does not 'disappoint'.  It has a typical lack-luster ending that comes from nowhere. I know going in that getting to the end is the great part.<br /><br />The story remains unfinished.  About three more chapters would have made this an excellent book.<br /><br />In typical Grisham fashion, I was glued to the pages throughout the novel.  This story develops right \\"on the nose\\". There is little surprise as the story unfolds, usually by wordy Grishamian dialog with a few too many details. This seems to be written as a primer for a screenplay in its execution, yet details such as mentioning Mercedes Benz and Jaguars for no apparent reason will only conflict with the movie when it's made.<br /><br />The problem with the final-twist ending is that there is not any closure for our anti-hero, Patrick.  He loses in the end by Eva, who was not a sufficiently developed character.  When she wins in the end, there is not enough attitude behind it.<br /><br />Grisham appears to triumph morals via immorality failures, yet the treatment is incomplete.  Essential, our main character Patrick is on a path to self-awareness.  Mid-life crisis backed by the consummate cheating wife begins the journey.  In his attempt to start over, he plots to disappear forever.  In wonderful storybook fashion, he gets the girl and the cash.  That part is excellent reading and is expected.  Then in a final attempt to transcend pure greed, our anti-hero is rocketed into self-realization when the girl and the loot are taken from him.  That part, too, is fine and almost expected.  Here is where the plot falls to pieces.<br /><br />The eventual 'winner' is Eva, The Partner of our main character.  She wins without foundation, thus the need for a few more chapters.  Patrick is stripped of his self-realization.  We needed to know more about Eva; what was Eva trying to escape? How did Eva set Patrick up?<br /><br />Since Patrick was so perfect at paying attention to detail as demonstrated by the whole premise of the story, how did Eva become so wise as to be the only one to outsmart Patrick?  Thus what are her credentials, her motivations and her feelings afterward?  If this was purely a last minute decision we need to know!  If this was the plan the whole way, then how and when did Eva find Patrick?  Everything tells us that he found her, yet this doesn't present enough evidence of her abilities.  The only reason I didn't deduct a Rating Star was because this actually might be genius:  Patrick was such a smart thief, that he couldn't help but be a smart, perfect tutor to Eva in the ways of the financial, legal, and underground world that the 'student' surpasses the 'teacher'.  However, if this is the case, we needed the final fax, the final phone call, or final telegram from Eva to Patrick to put in the last dig.  She needed to put Patrick in his place by either her wit, her whiles, or her heart, thus finishing the self-realization for Patrick.<br /><br />That is why a few more chapters would have made this story perfect.<br /><br />...I always read Grisham with the idea of loving the story and hating the ending.  When you read with these expectations, you come away totally satisfied.  Highly recommended!  4.9 Stars<br /><br />It's easy to be a critic.  Grisham wrote an excellent story.

B00005JLXE|3.0|I would like to start this review off by asking, perhaps the question of the century, why the heck did they cast Ben Affleck as Matt Murdock? He doesn't look like Matt did in the comics, he doesn't act like Matt did in the comics, and he acts the same in this movie as he has in his last five billion movies. I would have to say the only good performance in this movie was the guy that play the Kingpin (his name isnt coming to mind right now). As for the screenplay I loved it. The way it is filmed is beautiful, probably most beautifully filmed superhero movie. But those things dont make a good movie. Besides those things there wasn't much to this movie. The only people Ive talked to who like this are immature preteens who love to see Jennifer Garner in skin tight clothes and love accessive violence. There is a lot of talent in this film but it is wasted with poor acting and action getting in the way of plot. If you want to watch a movie that is candy for the eyes you can get it with the beautiful camera work. If your in it for the actual cinemotogrophy...Too bad you came to the wrong place.
B00004RJ71|4.0|I got this movie from my friend Alex and he told me to give it a look. I watched it 4 times before I returned it to him. this is a much deeper bond  than the reviews make it sound like. That changes the whole movie knowing all 3 are family, 2 brothers and their cousin Miklo who have been together for most of their lives. When Miklo goes to jail and El Gallo Negro to the Military to avoid prison you realize sometimes blood is not as strong of a bond as some people think.Miklo thinks that the gangs and the fact he is familia with \\"the black rooster\\" makes him safe. Watch this movie and realize it is not a prison movie it is about the strong bonds in families as well as the ups and downs of being handicapped. Sometimes nothing can stop someone from doing right or wrong.
B00007G207|5.0|I loved \\"Cinema Paradiso\\" from the first time I watched it. The child actor is one of the best I have ever seen, and I don't feel he ever received the accolades he deserved. The music is incredibly haunting. There is so much life in the film, not only among the main characters as people, but WWII-Italy is a character itself.     It is the story of how a young boy, Toto came of age without his father (who was fighting in the war) in an Italian  village. It is told from the perspective of a flash back, so that we know the little boy grew up to work in the film industry. He found a father figure in Alfredo, an older childless man, who ran the movie theater, and common to many Italians of the time, had little formal education but had a great capcity to educte Toto about life. It is also a story of community in times of trouble, and how the members support each other in their own way, for the greater good of all.    It is difficult to weave a story that captures the pure beauty of a life, while still incorpraing hardships such as death, poverty, heart ache, and the anxiety that accompanies growing up as well as witnessing the dissipation of a way of life, but this move does all of that, yet still retains originality in its story line, and possesses fully developed characters. The script is commendable.    I was skeptical when I saw that a new version was released for the anniversary, but bought it any way, because the original version is included. Too often, I feel that extra footage is added in order to appease some one's vanity who believed their work should not have been cut. But in the case of Cinema Paradiso, the extra footage greatly enriched the story and made the film more complete. I don't want to spoil it for any one who has not seen the impact of the new footage, but personally, I thought many issues in the original cut were left unaddressed with Toto's first love, and the extra film fills in these gaps, and also adds more depth to the characterization of Toto's mother and friends.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|At first, I thought the makers were having too much fun at Napoleon's expense, but as the movie went on, I was impressed with Napoleon's grumpy moxie. He is principled, and stands up for what he believes in.  <br />     I do not know if it was intended, but Jon Heder does an unbelievable job of portraying a person who might have the diagnosis of  Asperger's Disorder (autistic social features, normal intelligence). <br />     Additionally, the commentary reveals Hess is basically telling stories on himself, adding to the fun of this exceedingly dry-witted gem of a film. Bravo!
B00064MW6K|4.0|Ok i'm just going to cut right to the chase, and try to make this short. It's easy to read anyone of the negative reviews and think \\"CATWOMAN\\" is a bust! however, it is anything but. Growing up I was a huge fan of \\"Batman Returns\\", and when i heard WB was given the green light to create a seperate \\"Catwoman\\" project, i was thrilled. Michelle did an amazing job with the Catwoman Daniel Waters had created, and Tim Burton had invisioned. Not only was she pschologically dark, but the emotional rollercoaster she endured was unlike any seen before in a \\"comic book\\" based film. Michelle's selina kyle was a great love interest for Michael Keaton's bruce wayne. Their Romeo & Juliet style relationship fuels this stylish and sleek film. As many of us know the last frame in \\"Batman Returns\\" features Michelle's Catwoman rising up infront of the beautifully lit bat signal. With that aside the excitment and anticipation for the solo \\"Catoman\\" film got underway. Michelle was ready to get back into the role, as was Tim Burton...however, Michelle became pregnant and decided to choose family over film. I commend her for putting her family first. As the years went on actress after actress was in line to reprise Selina Kyle, but no one nailed it like Michelle. With everything working against them Warner Brothers was dumbfounded at what to do. Cancel the project, or continue onward. In 2001 things brightend up when Ashley Judd was on board... not as selina kyle but as Patience Price. This time there would be no batman. There would be no Gotham City. The original script involved Patience working for a ruthless politician who would strive at nothing to gain power. The script would be reminicent of Daniel Waters, Time Burton, and Frank Miller's bleak vision on the Femme Fetale. After months in limbo without a director Ashley and Tim Burton moved on to other projects. It would be another year and a half and two more actresses before it fell in the hands of Pitof! Nicole Kidman and Gweneth Paltrow were reportedly in the running of the title role, ultimatley the part went to 2001 oscar winner...Halle Berry. Halle expressed her excitment for taking on the role, and promised a fresh new look on the character of catwoman. However, the smart, edgy, sophisticated, and to my mind inventive script concept was dropped. Rumors swirled that Berry was not pleased the Warner Brothers decided to go with a new apporach and abandon the idea of Patience Price working under the ruthless politician. Still she wanted to portray \\"Catwoman\\"! When the new script came in about beauty cream that can kill, many thought are you for real, but they quickly realized that in 1989 Tim Burton used that same idea for \\"Batman\\". So realizing that the film was ago. If you are still reading this i commend you! haha...Now i understand many of you were not pleased with the end result that was \\"CATWOMAN\\", but i urge you to go in with an open mind. Yes it's EXTREMELY CAMPY and colorful and predictable, but the one thing this movie does that no other Incarnation of CATWOMAN has done is make the audience feel empowered! I was actually pleased with the end result. It's campy pop corn fun, but the underline subtext is what did it for me. Halle Berry brings new bite to Catwoman in a way that Michelle could never. Michelle's catwoman was deranged and confused, and very very tormented. Halle's is fun, sexy, and empowered within herself. At the end of the day you can hate this movie and beat it down, but i urge you to enjoy it for what it is. The music is hot, the acting is campy, the visuals are animated and bright, the sets are colorful, and the story is airy! but the overall message is FREEDOM is POWER, and EMPOWERMENT lives inside yourself. BE YOURSELF! so at the end of the day Michelle and Halle each brought something different to the character of catwoman. I don't think one is better then the other. One is dark One is light. One is emotionally distraught, and one is emotionally empowered. You decide.

B00005JN2Z|2.0|Hollywood is about Fantasy. If you want \\"reality\\" go shopping at Publix. Yet, the real secret to a great film is that something essential about it must be anchored to an aspect of reality. In terms of supplying \\"reality\\" the filmaker has to toss the viewer a bone, after which the viewer eagerly fills in the gaps. Well, Michael Mann tosses us no such bones here. The very essential premise; i.e. a high-tech, highly paid hit man decides to kill a series of eye-witnesses by enlisted the aid of a cabbie, is so fundamentally stupid the remainder of the film spins away into nothing.<br /><br />It really isn't necessary to enumerate the problems with this concept. Anyone that has ever flagged down a taxi, anytime or anywhere in the world, can immediately see the long list of obviouis problems.<br /><br />Secondly, all the key witnesses to this hugely important trial are simply available for the killing. Not a one of them is under police protection. Christ, who needs an overpaid hitman for this job?<br /><br />All in all, a very sad outing for Michael Mann, who normally delivers a tremendous film. Is this really the director that brought us that crime masterpiece, \\"Heat\\"?

0743424425|5.0|Nowadays it's really hard to be impressed with this book.  Perhaps because so many people have seen the movie they feel no need to pick up the book at all.  Well, I haven't seen the Stanley Kubrick movie, so when I read \\"The Shining\\" I had no expectations for it.<br /><br />If you saw the movie before reading the book, chances are (judging by these reviews) you won't like it as much because it isn't as \\"scary\\" as the movie.  Well, you can't really say the book is bad, even if you enjoyed the movie more.<br /><br />The Shining is about a man named Jack Torrance who takes his wife and son up to the Overlook hotel in Colorado to take care of it for the winter.  But his son Danny, has a gift.  This gift is called \\"The Shining\\".  The Shining allows Danny to read peoples minds, and see things that are beyond horror for his mind to comprehend.  The Overlook Hotel has a haunting past, and because of Danny's shining, he can see them.  Soon the hotel will control Jack and send him out of control and drive him mad.  But Danny and Wendy (the wife) are snowbound, and that means that when Jack does go insane, there will be no way out.<br /><br />It's easy to see how this is a classic.  It's often times said to be the scariest book King has ever written.<br /><br />Truthfully though, you've got to have patience when you read this book.  King spends a lot of time developing Jack, Wendy and Danny, and that makes this book a little more slowly paced than other books he's written.  Slow pace is by no means a bad thing, but The Shining for some may pace too slow.<br /><br />The book was enjoyable though, and while I don't believe it's the best thing King has written (my personal favorite is \\"Misery\\"), but it is a remarkable classic.<br /><br />However, if you've seen the Kubrick film, I can't imagine many people enjoying this to the full extent.  The Kubrick film ruins most of the surprises and takes away from the suspense and horror (and the film is VERY different from the book).  The climax of the book, many may argue, is not as shattering as the films.  However, this shouldn't stop the read from being an enjoyable one.from the book).

B0006399FS|1.0|I've tried hard to like this CD. The band sounds tight, Edge never played better, & Bono's voice hasn't been this fluid in years-- Yet, somehow it sounds like the band is on one page, & Bono is on another... Change that-- A completely different book!<br /><br />Edge & Bono  have never been the greatest song writers--  They have amazing musical ideas, but have never had the craft to regularly tie the pieces together into  a completed song-- Like a John Lennon, Paul McCartney or Pete Townsend can.  But powerful, heartfelt emotion & passion , along with charisma, can make the \\"journey\\" so compelling, one stops caring about the destination. That's why someone like Neil Young can effortlessly rip out our souls armed with nothing but sloppy guitar licks, a wavering voice,  & a bare skeleton of  a song.<br /><br />Like Young,  U2 has that ability--  But,  (like any truly great band) it  comes from their combined creative force, & it stems from being tightly interwoven in each other's lives (That's why studio musicians almost never make great bands). \\"Atomic\\" feels like Edge & the rest of the band did an album,  & Bono submitted a tepid solo album--  But on the same tracks! It's unlikely these guys hang with each other like the old days. Nor do they do the endless touring that was once a career necessity. It shows.<br /><br />I suspect this would have been a completely different CD if they had taken a few months to tour together first. The Stones were at a similar crossroads throughout much of the 1980's-- Still had the chops, could SOUND like the Rolling Stones, but had lost the essence that made them a single creative voice. They recaptured this in a simple way-- They now never lay tracks without hitting at least some small venues first, and they keep hitting stages until they bring \\"The Stones\\" back to life.<br /><br />A handful of \\"drop-ins\\" by Bono at the recording studio just doesn't cut it anymore.

B00009ATIX|3.0|The movie differs way too much from the book, some things are not explained enough, others are just plain ommited. Also, where did the director get the idea of changing one of the characters. This change makes me wonder if he read the book at all, or whether he just skimmed through it during his limo ride to the studio.
B00005JKN9|3.0|This movie may take a while to find its proper place in critical thought, and I'll have to watch it again in a year or two to see if I've changed my opinion.  It's a huge, sprawling epic, loosely centered around the story of Amsterdam (Leonardo DiCaprio), the son of Priest Vallon, who was killed in a gang war by Bill the Butcher Cuttings (Daniel Day-Lewis) in 1846.  Bill, see, is jingoistic and hates the Irish immigrants; Priest Vallon's gang the Dead Rabbits was about the rights of the poor new Americans. <br /> <br />All of this takes place in a squalid part of New York known as the Five Points.  When Amsterdam gets out of the reform school where he's been for sixteen years, he promptly returns to the Five Points, finds Bill who now utterly controls the area, and ends up working for him.  He also, somewhat against his will, falls for Jenny (Cameron Diaz), luminous and the most skillful \\"bludget\\" (pickpocket) around. <br /> <br />This is a long movie, and at times it's hard to know what the central thrust of the story is-- is it Amsterdam's search for revenge?  the first part of that story ends halfway through.  Is it how Tammany Hall actually helps the Irish elect a sheriff?  That for me was one of the more fun sections of the movie.  But that too, ends abruptly.  The big gang showdown is intercut and interrupted by the antidraft riots that erupted all over the city (Lincoln's draft for the Civil War). <br /> <br />I found myself wondering what Scorsese's point was, here.  It's clear he's somewhat sympathetic to the rioters, but not to their violence.  Nobody likes a draft, but protecting the union was a pretty just cause (and the Irish sympathies for the blacks among them as opposed to Bill Cuttings' attitude suggests a latent abolitionist sympathy).  So it's hard to feel any sense of exhileration for all the violence and blood thrown in our faces over and over and over again.  Most of what we see in the Five Points is sheer squalor-- there must be people payingrent and living in houses, but the only one we ever see is one burning down (everyone else seems to scurry around in underground caves). <br /> <br />All of the acting is good, and it's true that most Americans today have no idea how hard Irish immigrants had it.  They were caricatured in cartoons, treated as subhumans, faced with signs that said \\"No Irish need apply.\\"  All true.  But Scorsese never succeeds in showing us how the Irish were the Hands that Built America (the title of the U2 song that ends the film).  There's little payoff for sticking with Amsterdam and Jenny all the way through-- the movie just seems to end, without letting us in on what will happen to them in particular.  Sure, we see shots of the city growing enormous but heck, don't we all know New York becomes a major metropolis? <br /> <br />So while there's an awful lot of historicity here, as a narrative, it's often confusing and lacks payoff.  It's well worth a look, but don't expect the rush of identification you get with epics like Braveheart (admittedly, that was not historical at all!).  All of the performances are really terrific.  I just wish they were in a slightly more coherant story.

B0000028UK|1.0|I'll admit it, back in the early days, I was a real big fan of Peal Jam.  They rocked, and  , more importantly, they stood up for those less fortunate than middle America.  Than I head the song 'Daughter' and I learned that Eddie didn't have sympathy for at least one disadvantaged group in America: The mentally handicapped.  On that track he cruelly and heartlessly mocks the vocal affectations of those with mental disabilities, just to get a cheap laugh.  I'll admit it, his impression is dead on: he totally sounds like a 'tard. But is it really appropriate to mock the mentally handicapped, particularly when one is involved in so many fashionable, liberal causes?  Well, no.  The time for fratboy humor is over, Mr. Vedder.
B000002505|4.0|This is one of the first albums I bought in my first tenative explorations of jazz.  I was none to please with it either.  For the most part, I was unhappy with the dense cacophony of notes.  I was, as I remember, quite drawn to \\"Naima\\".<br /><br />Now, some thirty years later, my perspective has changed.  What appeared to me to be a grab bag of notes thrown in and given a song title are now quite logical and expressive \\"conversations\\" among gifted musicians.  It also is more \\"rock\\" oriented than I perceived it to be thirty years ago.  Such is my taste after all these long years in the \\"school of jazz\\".<br /><br />Still, we have to address that album in context and why it got such a bad rap at the time.  Jazz purists hated it precisely because of its \\"rock\\" structures.  As with all \\"fusion\\", jazz heads hated and rejected all that Miles Davis hath wrought in his quest to update and incorporate new sounds into the jazz vocabulary.  Miles and his disciples (and would-be disciples) were very much seen as the bratty, trust fund, rich boys who were lost in dissipation and squandering the wealth their forefathers built up over the years.<br /><br />The \\"rock\\" standpoint was more complicated.  As any brief survey of rock music in the first half of the 1970's shows, most jazz-rock had very little appeal to those coming of age at the time.  If you popped the cork out of the bottle and took enough drinks, the unkind assessment that jazz musicians were desperately trying to increase dwindling record sales and live gigs by bastardizing rock and roll would rise to the surface.  There was also anger that one of the freshest and most promising \\"sounds\\" to come out of the late 1960's was being lost.  Carlos Santana's flirtation with jazz was seen as devastating to his talent and \\"voice\\".<br /><br />But more than all the above, the pictures of Carlos Santana standing next to his guru and John McLaughlin-dressed in white, chastised of his long locks of hair, so rigid and anxious like a little boy who had been taken to the wood shed-tapped a generational primal fear.  Santana has this pitiful look on his face as if to say \\"No, don't spank me anymore.  I promise to be good.  Really, I will.\\"  This photograph communicated everything us pagan baby-boomers feared so much in religious conversions among our contemporaries.  Whether those conversions were Christian or one of a myriad of Eastern religions, the transformation of independent and freedom loving individuals into constrained and \\"soul-less\\" beings terrified us.  In spite of the fact that these new converts testified to new freedom and peace, at bottom we were certain it was not true.  Baby boomers loved to talk about how \\"spiritual\\" they were; but actually conforming to a discipline went against the gospel of freedom.  After all, in the common folklore of my generation, why would you break free of the stifling prison of our parents' suburban lifestyle only to enter another prison of religious hypocrisy?  (We were certain all those religiously observant were hypocrites underneath:  every Billy Graham was secretly an Elmer Gantry.)  Whatever kisses we placed on the altar of pluralism, we were certain that \\"authentic\\" people would be just like us.<br /><br />The passing of the years has not been kind to our youthful idealism.  Life's adventures and misadventures has generally led us to look more kindly on those who did not insist on \\"total authenticity\\".  Still, even after all these years, the pictures on the album cover continue to make me uncomfortable.  Santana himself has moved on and has gone under several transformations.  The fact that Santana has gone through several lead singers-never taking on that chore himself-has tended to obscure his image and push him off the popular radar screen.  In terms of instrumental magic, everything he has done since 1973's CARAVANSERAI simply pales.  Indeed, CARAVANSERAI is a much better album than LOVE DEVOTION SURRENDER.  Spiritual considerations aside,Santana did not need John McLaughlin to garner legitimacy for himself.<br /><br />But taken on its own terms, LOVE DEVOTION SURRENDER is a love letter to John Coltrane and Miles Davis-not just as musicians but a kind of spiritual acolytes to the sacred beyond.  What appeared to me a confused jumble of notes now sounds like baskets of joy offered one after the other. \\"A Love Supreme\\" rings with the proclamation of divine faithfulness.  It is not as sublime as Coltrane's original; but the interplay between the two guitarists makes it more intense.  \\"Naimi\\" remains the quiet and gentle thing it is-but it does not grab me as much now as it did thirty years ago.  (Much the same thing can be said for the album ender \\"Mediation\\".)<br /><br /> \\"The Life Divine\\" just falls flat for me.  It did thirty years ago and now-with my more educated ears-it still does.  I don't know whether it was the \\"moment\\" or the actual structure of the piece, but it just doesn't \\"build\\".<br /><br />The real centerpiece of the album is the fifteen minute \\"Let Us Go Into The House Of The Lord\\".  Based on the same-named Christian hymn, Santana and McLaughlin appeal to images in the Western imagination to mirror an Eastern dissolve into blessedness.  The old hymn was based on Psalm 122 and calls forth a double meaning of entering the Lord's house here on earth and being received into God's heavenly house in the \\"days to come\\".  Some may feel it is overly long, but its length is not unusual for either jazz or rock.  Many of us dread worship services of any kind due to the tedious \\"Mickey Mouse\\" modern liturgists are sure we demand.  But as the ancients knew, it is in the lifting up and offering of praise that God gives Himself to those who love Him.  Whether you believe this or not, Santana and McLaughlin clearly do. This is a sweet ride that goes from simple statements to almost ecstatic exchange at the end.  You may prefer the more earthy (and shorter) Clapton guitar solo on Cream's version of \\"Crossroads\\"; but the delight the listener experiences is undeniable.<br /><br />In the end, no matter how \\"rocky\\" this album is in basic musical structure, this CD will appeal mostly to jazz fans who have a particular taste for the \\"fusion\\" period of the 1970's.  This is not everyone's cup of tea.  If you're a rock fan whose taste settles in Led Zeppelin -or James Taylor for that matter-this is not the place to expand your horizons.  Even if you like Paul Simon's \\"cocktail jazz\\" stuff, this is still not your bag.  And don't think if you are especially \\"spiritual\\" in your soul this is for you.  But to those few can appreciate that brief window when jazz was learning a new vocabulary for itself (\\"rock\\" that is-\\"funk\\" is a different story altogether) this is a beautiful if short experiment.tions aside, Santana did not need John McLaughlin to garner legitimacy for himself. <br /> <br />But taken on its own terms, LOVE DEVOTION SURRENDER is a love letter to John Coltrane and Miles Davis-not just as musicians but a kind of spiritual acolytes to the sacred beyond.  What appeared to me a confused jumble of notes now sounds like baskets of joy offered one after the other. \\"A Love Supreme\\" rings with the proclamation of divine faithfulness.  It is not as sublime as Coltrane's original; but the interplay between the two guitarists makes it more intense.  \\"Naimi\\" remains the quiet and gentle thing it is-but it does not grab me as much now as it did thirty years ago.  (Much the same thing can be said for the album ender \\"Mediation\\".)  <br /> <br /> \\"The Life Divine\\" just falls flat for me.  It did thirty years ago and now-with my more educated ears-it still does.  I don't know whether it was the \\"moment\\" or the actual structure of the piece, but it just doesn't \\"build\\". <br /> <br />The real centerpiece of the album is the fifteen minute \\"Let Us Go Into The House Of The Lord\\".  Based on the same-named Christian hymn, Santana and McLaughlin appeal to images in the Western imagination to mirror an Eastern dissolve into blessedness.  The old hymn was based on Psalm 122 and calls forth a double meaning of entering the Lord's house here on earth and being received into God's heavenly house in the \\"days to come\\".  Some may feel it is overly long, but its length is not unusual for either jazz or rock.  Many of us dread worship services of any kind due to the tedious \\"Mickey Mouse\\" modern liturgists are sure we demand.

B0002EXH5O|5.0|one of the fastest metal albums in existence, this album comes at you at about 150 mph and never slows down until dawn patrol.  <br /> <br />Holy Wars: 10/10- classic opening guitar riff, starts charging and cant stop. great lyrics, and a wonderfully constructed headbanger <br /> <br />Hangar 18: 8/10- slows down the tempo just about a half notch, but the cheesy lyrics really bring the song down. otherwise, good guitar riffs. <br /> <br />Take No Prisoners: 9/10- some of the verses get irritating, but the chorus really brings it all together: TAKE NO PRISONERS... TAKE NO SH*T!! great drumming  <br /> <br />Five Magics: 10/10- not a huge fan of the slow opening, but once the song gets going it really picks up and becomes one of the best songs on the album. i just wish the \\"give me sorcery..electricity\\" verse was repeated again in the song, cause it really sounds cool, but what can ya do <br /> <br />Poison Was the Cure: 9/10- one of the fastest songs on the album, suffers from the lack of a main hook. great song though <br /> <br />Lucretia: 10/10- slower guitar riffs, but the vocals have a definate groove to it, making it more appealing. great song <br /> <br />Tornado of Souls: 10/10- another song with a groove to it, a bit repetitive but it doesnt really hurt the song any. <br /> <br />Dawn Patrol: ???- i dont realy view this as a song, i wont average into the reviews cuz this doesnt make any sense.  <br /> <br />Rust In Peace...Polaris: 11/10- my favorite song on the album, very very underrated. great drum opening and great lyrics.  <br /> <br />original tracks: 68/80 B+ <br /> <br />Bonus Tracks: i dont really care for My Creation much, the demos are pretty cool tho! 8/10
B00005CDUE|5.0|How can anyone find this cd anything but splendid. It's a great through the years compilation of Roxy music's perfect passionate music. If you like Roxy music you should appreciate this cd, as it has a bit of everything from the present to the past. A nice sampler.
B0002OERI0|5.0|What this album achieves is so rare for today; an album that rocks from beginning to end. I am blown away. The first ever \\"punk-rock opera\\"? Whatever you want to call it, Green Day has come into their own with their greatest musical achievement yet. I want more!
B00000IBDY|4.0|This album is very well done and worth owning for any fans of 60's Psych out there. The instrumentation is often very psych tinged, and the singer does a great job throughout the record. It's definetly in the vein of the Blossom Toes or early/mid Pink Floyd stuff. <br /> <br />The \\"singles\\" on the record, (especially My White Bicycle and the stuff by the Aquarian Age), are very memorable and make this record worth purchasing alone.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Wow.  This album has exceeded every one of my expectations in ways I still can't believe.  3 or so months after buying it, and I still can't put it down.  I've been into Green Day for many years now, ever since \\"Dookie\\" came out.  I've always enjoyed their catchy brand of melodic punk, and although I wasn't really listening to them as much in recent times, I never stopped liking them.  So of course, the news of Green Day doing a \\"rock opera\\" featuring 9-minute songs couldn't help but peak by interest.  I thought at best though, that it'd be an interesting experiment, and most likely not up to the standards of the band's past work.  I was wrong.  Way wrong.<br /><br />Green Day's newest album, \\"American Idiot\\", is one of the most infectious and perfectly written albums I've heard in quite some time.  Every note of it is just magnificently engaging, and the flow of the album is brilliant.  This album stands as the most mature, focused, and solid release of the band's career, hands down.  Rather than attempting to change their style completely (as was the case with \\"Warning\\", which was met with mixed results), they have taken the signature Green Day style, mixed it with more varied and elaborate structures, and made an album that is musically sophisticated, simple without being overly simplistic, and about as catchy as an album can hope to get.<br /><br />For this album, the band takes influence from a rich variety of sources, and melds them beautifully with the band's signature sound.  There is audible influence from such bands as The Ramones (\\"St. Jimmy\\"), The Clash (\\"Holiday\\"), The Beach Boys (\\"Give Me Novacaine\\"), The Beatles (\\"Extraordinary Girl\\"), and the Who (\\"Are We the Waiting\\").  Some of these influences may be a bit too obvious for some, but I personally don't find them distracting.  Rather, they enrich the band's sound, and add a bit of diversity that has often been lacking in their music in the past.<br /><br />The two nine-minute epics, \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" and \\"Homecoming\\", are brilliantly done, with perfect flow.  The songs are basically smaller parts woven together into one composition, and the result is excellent on both accounts.  They include numerous tempo changes, additional instruments such as piano and saxophone, and tons of powerful melodies.  Sure, Green Day can work wonders with a 2-3 minute song, but they have proven their expertise in writing longer epics as well.<br /><br />The rest of the tracks are closer to average Green Day length, with a fair share of variety between them.  \\"St. Jimmy\\", \\"Letterbomb\\", and the title track are basically your average fast-paced catchy Green Day-ish tracks.  \\"She's a Rebel\\" and \\"Holiday\\" are more mid-paced anthemic rockers.  \\"Give Me Novacaine\\" [sic], \\"Are We the Waiting\\", and the exceptional \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" are more slower paced, with killer vocal deliveries.  \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends\\" is an emotional ballad, featuring acoustic and electric guitars, and the most earnest emotion the band has exhibited since \\"Good Riddance\\" from \\"Nimrod\\".  All in all, this album is musically exceptional, and never misses a step.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, this album is a \\"rock opera\\", a story put to music.  While many albums of this nature tend to be rather cheesy and overdone, Green Day have completely avoided such pitfalls, and made a concept that is intelligent, emotional, culturally relevant, and most importantly, doesn't take itself too seriously.  The lyrics have that acerbic Green Day wit, but with more maturity and thought than we're used to hearing from the band.  The story is of a troubled youth from a small American town, who runs away from home, moves to the big city, and gains notoriety as a violent radical.  The concept reminds me a bit of Queensryche's \\"Operation Mindcrime\\", but much more down to earth.<br /><br />I apologize greatly for the length of this review.  Quite frankly, I could have gone on even longer.  I really can't say enough about how great this album really is.  Green Day really took me by surprise with \\"American Idiot\\", and I believe they have definitely reached the zenith of their career.  This is one of my most listened-to albums in recent times, and most likely will continue to be for some time.  Buy this, whether you're a Green Day fan or not.  It is spectacular, and destined to be a classic.ay enough about how great this album really is.

6303269869|5.0|A beautiful family movie!  It's good to see a family that sticks together even in difficult times. The father showed magnificent strength in the support of the mother during her struggle with substance abuse.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|This is a film that had such an excellent concept that depending on how it was handled, it would either be mildly diverting or truly enthralling. With a concept like this, it could be anything from decent to excellent. But to figure out which, I had to see it for myself. <br />Van Helsing  <br />Here's how it ranked... <br />Sound: 4/5 <br />Don't get me wrong. The sound quality was good, and the music was good too, just not great. Movies like \\"The Mummy\\" for example, outrank it pretty easily in terms of soundtrack quality. The music helps to set the mood well, but isn't worth buying the soundtrack for. <br />Graphics: 5/5 <br />Okay, the graphics were perfect, and unlike in X-men, you got the chance to see them for more than a few seconds at a time. <br />Story Concept: 5/5 <br />The concept is truly top-knotch. It's the story of Van Helsing the monster hunter and how he discovers his destiny to fight with Count Dracula and his evil minions. There's more to it than that, but the rest serves only to make the story even better. <br />Story Presentation: 4.5/5 <br />The story presentation was generally very good, but I felt that the basic humanity kind of wasn't in most of the characters. The other problem I had was the amount of times Dracula would walk on walls and ceilings. I know it was meant to be aesthetically-creepy, but it just came off as goofy. <br />Acting: 3.5/5 <br />This is the movie's biggest failing. Van Helsing and Anna both got wonderful acting talents, but most of the rest of them were mediocre actors, except Dracula, who was a truly horrible and cheesy actor, constantly posing, flourishing and over-enunciating his lines as though in an opera. The reason this grade isn't lower is that I think they made the Dracula performance cheesy on purpose, to mirror the performances of Bella Legosi and the others. Still, kind of a disappointment. <br />All in All: 4.4/5 <br />It's a better-than-average movie. I reccomend it if you're a fan of the old-school horror genre to which it is, as far as I can tell, a fitting tribute. I was particularly impressed by the fact that they used the book version of the Frankenstein creature, to add a sense of pity and tragedy to the whole thing. Some of the character interactions were golden, and a lot of the fight scenes are among the best I've ever seen. In particular, the fight at the end between Dracula and a werewolf would make the entire movie worth it, even if it totally stunk, which it doesn't.
6300214184|5.0|This is a movie that I still enjoy watching today.Jennifer Beals did an outstanding job playing the heroine of this movie. <br />The theme song of this movie is still in play today on the radio.I still have a copy of the original tape. <br />  Beals is a welder during the day and dances in a club at night.She is in constant practice for an audition at an exclusive dance studio.She gets her audition and you wind up with another unforgetable scene from the movie.Of course her wealthy boss who she is dating also does his part in helping our <br />heroine. <br />  This is the ultimate feel good movie.The music is good and the actors are good.Long live Flashdance.
B00005JMXX|3.0|Well, I might not even have gone to see this movie except for the fact that I was invited to see it with a friend, and since Spider-Man 2 wasn't out yet, I figured \\"why not?\\" It can't hurt. <br />The Day After Tomorrow <br />Here's how it ranked... <br />Sound: 3/5 <br />Hmmm... Well, it had some music. Some music that was good at setting a mood, but honestly, I would never want to listen to that music by itself, and there were points when I felt the music was trying to coax me into feeling something that a scene just didn't deserve, so... <br />Graphics: 5/5 <br />Yeah. The graphics were very good. Very expensive too, I would imagine. <br />Story Concept: 3.5/5 <br />Well, it was tough for even someone like me to decypher it all, but the basic idea is that global warming and water pollution derail a temperature current and as a result, three continent-sized hurricanes go around flash-freezing everything. A concept like this would normally earn the movie a 4.5, but the majority of the movie is spent watching (you guessed it) people scurry around looking for one another and trying to escape this new ice age. It felt like an insect's eye view of the entire incident, and frankly, I found that kind of depressing. <br />Story Presentation: 3/5 <br />Here we go. Well, the movie made a big deal of its central theme (global warming=ice age,) but that didn't really take up much time in the film. As I said, this scientist Jack and his kid Sam dominate most of the film. This is its central flaw, in my mind, since neither of them starts out as a terrible likable or human character and thus no matter how personal the movie gets with them, it doesn't increase the quality any. They weren't hateful characters, but they weren't all that human either. The director of this film proved he was excellent at depicting huge catastrophies and terrible at depicting rushed romances in Independence Day, and he reinforces that with this film, in which he manages a truly spectacular catastrophyand a truly cheesy romantic cameo that harkens back to a hundred other such cameo-appearance romances in older films. The speed with which the storms move about and do their work is not the least believable thing about the movie though. With your permission, I will go through a few points of interest. <br />Nearer to the beginning of the film, when the huge disasters start happening, and the kids get trapped after New York City is smashed into by a 50 foot wall of water, one of the kids finds a payphone which he says will work better than their cel-phones because it gets its power from the electrical lines. Now, my telephone goes out when there's a THUNDERSTORM, never mind a huge wall of water. One might argue that if a wall of water can smash in windows and toss busses, it can certainly knock out some telephone lines. <br />Secondly, a tanker of some sort finds its way into New York while it's flooded, with things on-board apparently written in Russian. I have no problem accepting that a Russian Tanker could be docked in New York's harbors. What bugs me is how it managed to weave its way in between those tall buildings without so much as a captain to guide it. <br />Third, later in the film, the kids get chased by a pack of wolves. Wolves. In New York. I suppose they could have escaped from the zoo or something, but then, shouldn't they have been followed by lions, tigers and bears (oh, my) and a few other interesting animals? The film tries to hint that they escaped from some kind of \\"wolf kennel\\" (yeah, right,) but we all know there are problems with that explanation. I think they just put the wolves in because New York was supposed to look like Alaska at that point, but the wolves just look suspicious in New York. Maybe they just took a cab in from Alaska or something. <br />The idea of global warming leading to a new ice age isn't at all tough to believe, but in half a week? Come on now. The idea that the President would be the last to leave the White House isa little less believable though. <br />Having said all that, the film's execution is not without a bit of pleasing irony. As people head south towards warmer climates, the mexican officials close the borders to the american immegrants. Classic. The fact that the bum in New York is the one with the most experience in staying alive in situations like the kind they get through in this film adds some charm too. <br />Acting: 4/5 <br />Only a few examples of truly bad acting could be found in this movie. Mostly its problem was the execution. <br />All in All: 3.7/5 <br />When I first heard of this movie, I thought that it wouldn't be a sci-fi. It was, but only because of the last totally-unbelievable circumstance this movie had to offer. Near the end, Dick Cheney (we're left to suppose it's him) tells the American people that he was wrong. We all know that no member of America's administration would ever admit to being wrong about something. They're more likely to say \\"Who, me? I was against this whole 'global warming' thing from the start.\\" Still, this movie has the distinction of being one of the first movies to portray the northern hemisphere in a 3-day ice age, and parts of it, as I said, were quite enjoyable, so it deserves credit for that. This one you can decide whether you want to see it or not, but in my mind, it's not indespensible.
0316172324|4.0|In Blink, Malcolm Gladwell suggests that first impressions significantly affect our actions and attitudes in business, dating, and even shopping. He describes the deeply complex concept of implicit cognition in an understandable and applicable way, and while Blink is not the foremost authority on this subject, Gladwell does an excellent job explaining how and why first impressions occur. I would suggest Blink to anyone who is interested in better understanding first impressions and the influence that \\"thin-slicing\\" has upon how we interact with the world around us.
B0001AP158|5.0|I rented this DVD, but couldn't stop playing it, so I eventually had to buy it.  It's brilliant!  Maybe it's not for those who can't accept change, but life is change, and if you have an open heart and open mind and love music, this DVD and the songs done in such a muture, jaw dropping, mesmerizing, heart throbbing, and mind refreshing way can not fail to lift you up to the sky.  I can't say enough about it.  I love it!!!  If you have the least bit of an open mind, GET IT!  If this is the direction he's going I can't WAIT to hear what he does next!
0385336810|5.0|Well, I don't have much to say.  I'm not about to write a summary.  i just wanted to share that I loved this book!!  it was interesting the entire time, the characters, the story.  I am a true romantic at heart so this book has the perfect ending which is crucial in my eyes to a good book.  But it was perfect everywhere else, too!
B00005JMYI|5.0|This movie is so funny. Will Ferrell is my favorite Saturday night live comedian. He does a great job as Ron Burgundy The anchorman of San Diego. He brings in a funny cast especially Paul Rudd who I did not recognize but was funny too. My favorite scene is when he reads something hes not on the news report. Ron reads everything. It's so funny. Christina Applegate does a good job too as the woman anchor who all the men try to pick up in very perverted sexual ways. you'll laugh so hard. The crew is jealous of the new female reporter and try to do everything to fire her with some obnoxious and funny scenes. Christina finaly gets her break as co-anchor for one evening when Ron does not show up to due a \\"dog problem\\". Christina does the news and all hell breaks loose between the two of them and they start exchanging nasty words to each other and  physically fighting by throwing things at each other.  Finally Christina gets back at Ron by writing something on the teleprompt that Ron isn't supposed to read but does without noticing, which is hilarious.  This fuels more anger between the two makes for more funny scenes to come.  Ben Stiller has a cameo as a Mexical news anchor, Tim Robbins another cameo,  and Vince Vaughn is good too.  Luke Wilson also has a cameo in this one. There's even a fight scene between 4 of the top 4 I guess anchor stations, hilarious!!I highly recommend this DVD you'll laugh your butt off!!!
0380713802|1.0|A page and a half from the end of this worthless narrative is the key to Mr. Bryson's travel philosophy: \\"...what an odd thing tourism is.  You fly off to a strange land, eagerly abandoning all the comforts of home, and then expend vast quantities of time and money in a largely futile effort to recapture the comforts that you wouldn't have lost if you hadn't left home in the first place.\\"  This is a perfect attitude for the armchair traveler; these are exactly the people that should not travel.  Buy Mr. Bryson's books and stay home.  I hope no one with this attitude would presume to make themselves an ambassador to any foreign land.  The whole point of travel/tourism is to have new experiences and to realize that your miniscule world is not all there is.  I unfortunately forced myself to finish Neither Here Nor There at the end of a trip to New Hampshire.  Had I realized Mr. Bryson's residence was so close, I would have liked to have coffee, simply to see if such a narrow-minded attitude is more than a writing persona.
B00008VGK0|4.0|These are great remixes of an underrated song. American Life the video was pulled by Madonna due to its violent content depicting images of war. She did this out of respects for the troops fighting in Iraq and Afghansitan. I guess pulling it was neither bad decision or a good decision but sort of mixed for me. <br /> <br />The song has nothing to to with the video whatsover.I dont like the Missy Elliott American Deam Mix. Missy Elliot just basically talks in it a lot and raps and theres not a lot of music. Its rather boring and slow. The rest of the remixes are all great and great to dance to and they use some interesting sounds. Peter Rauofer does amazing job with the American Anthem Part 1 and 2 mix. The drums work wonders  in the Anthem Part 1 and 2 remix. I love how the American Anthem Part 1 ends with her rapping as in the original song except they add a great electronic sound to it and blend it in the rap. I liked it better than the original album version. Die Another Day is a total different remix you wont find on the DAD maxi single. Its starts off with her laughing and saying \\"my body now\\" a many times and throws in some other lines from the song. Its got more music than lyrics. This is my favorite remix of the James Bond song and is better than the remixes on the maxi DAD single.   I again recommend these remixes I guarentee you wont be dissapointed!!!
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I admire anybody who tries to summarize the plot of this movie. Believe me, I've tried quite unsuccessfully. Still, this movie was funny to me. It is important to note that THIS IS NOT A MOVIE THAT EVERYBODY WILL LIKE. Some people will hate it, while other love it. It depends entirely on your sense of humor.  <br /> <br />If you need a plot and deep, insightful commentary to guide you through a movie...uhhh go see another one. But if you liked Monty Python and the Holy Grail, then you might like this one. Napoleon Dynamite is one of the weirdest kids ever brought to life. He wears unicorn shirts and these boots that are...ski boots?? I have no idea. His friends consist of the quiet Pedro and the \\"I still think it's the 80s\\" Deb. Actually, many of the characters seem to be in that decade...or maybe the movie is supposed to take place then? Anyway... <br /> <br />If you don't think throwing a steak and a guy on a bicycle is funny, or a guy with a casserole going up to a llama and saying \\"Tina you fat lard!\\", then don't watch. If you're one of those special people like me who cracked a smile at that, then GO SEE IT!
0060536357|5.0|This book is one of the best business books out there and you wont waste a penny on it. <br />The story shows how greed and money can destroy even the wildest of dreams and ambition in the world that we live in.The go go 80's was the time of the big swinging you-know-what believing themselves as the masters of the universe thus inevitably above everything else. <br /> <br />The story of how a great american company RJR Nabisco loses battle for control of the company by a group a financiers of KKR led by Henry Kravis.The story unfolds from the time Ross Johson,the CEO of RJR Nabisco, decides to take the company private.In doing so he puts the company in play and then the action begins to take place as other huge financial firms with ego as huge as Ross Johnson try to get a piece of the action.In the end there is only one winner and doznes of losers. <br /> <br />Barbarians at the gate also gives you an insight on the LBO fad and how it works.Those who follow wallstreet in the 80's know that non of this could have happened werent it for the service of Michael Milken and his junk bonds.in any case,it is interesting how the authors who obviously went to great lengths researching and interviewing the players involved and displays the facts in such an entertaining manner you wish you wanted to finish the book in one sitting!! <br /> <br />The only con i found was the story of how RJR and Nabisco came into existent (the authors stretch this bit too far when they could have done it in 15 pages). nonetheless, it was a great read. <br /> <br />10 stars for this book!! <br />
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|I was pretty excited when this movie came out. It had alot of promise with a great cast of actors and a story that has survived the ages. And it was good. Don't get me wrong, it was well done and the actors all portrayed their characters in what I thought was a correct manner. However I must agree with Mr. Barnabo (spelling? sorry!) when he says \\"The big selling point for this film was not Homer but rather Brad Pitt as Achilles.\\" <br /> <br />The movie is worth seeing, if only for Brad Pitt. I always thought he was a bit overrated, but after seeing this movie...WOW. Orlando Bloom gets a much less manly character (Paris I believe) and is really, for lack of better words, a huge wuss. Of course, not his fault, but still not as sexy as the ultra manly character of Achilles. <br /> <br />But as I said in my title, the movie is about 3 hours long. At about the 2 hour mark you're like, \\"Ah, this movie must be wrapping up.\\" But nope! Sorry, you've got another hour left. I sat through Lord of the Rings with no problem, but this one left me a little bored. Special effects: very cool. Seeing an entire sea filled with ships is still awe-inspiring. But still...it was just ok. <br /> <br />Great soundtrack though. The Josh Groban song is amazing.
B0001ZX0PG|2.0|Please read the book first....otherwise you risk losing a great read because once you sit through this film you'll no longer wish to read it. I read the book, then saw the flick at the theater, maybe I was expecting too much considering how much I enjoyed the book but it was really, really bad. Please avoid.Girlfriend didn't like, parents either.
0679777547|3.0|A book acquirer -- buyer if possible, thief if necessary -- gets sent on a slightly metafictive mission. He's an interesting character, obsessed with recreating the battle of Waterloo so that Napoleon wins, but a bit emotionally distant from the action. There's one plot that's all about The Three Musketeers and another plot that's all about summoning the devil. The one about the Three Musketeers is all a bit crossword-puzzley and precious. The one about summoning the devil is more interesting, but the tone of the book is slightly wrong for it -- it never quite makes you scared the way it should, everything is too prosaic and brightly lit, and there are no shadows for interesting things to hide in, though there's a blunt, casual sexiness that creeps in every so often that I quite liked.
B000001FN3|5.0|I stumbled onto this album in vinyl when it was first released.  I was aware that Alan Parsons had produced two legendary albums, the Beatles' Abbey Road and Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon, and Poe was/is my favorite American author.  I bought the album without having the first clue what to expect, but knowing that a genius in the art of musical production was taking on a musical presentation of some of the best writings of a great author.  So I took the chance. <br /> <br />I was not disappointed.  Now on CD the sound is more crisp, of course. The subtle undertones that did not always translate well from vinyl are clear and present, providing sinister currents in Tell Tale Heart and Cask of Amontillado that were difficult to detect on all but the finest high end turntables of the 1970's.   <br /> <br />The beauty of these re-tellings of Poe's tales is that Parsons and Eric Woolfson did not simply set Poe's words to music.  Instead they undertook the bold task of trying to get inside the psychological workings of Poe's protagonists and reveal the depths of their madness.  So, for example, if you expect a thumping heart beat to be the centerpiece of Tell Tale Heart, you may be surprised to learn that such is not the case at all.   <br /> <br />Tales of Mystery and Imagination is a departure from the standard fare of the mid 70's, and well worth the time investment of the listener.  The music still holds up -- easily as well as the standrard musical fare of the mid 70's, and better than most of it.  Not all of the APP albums succeed as well as this one, but that is more because this is such an outstanding album than because of any special deficiencies in the later offerings.  A truly stunning work, and not just for fans of Poe.
B00003CXE7|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie when it came out in theaters (yes, I know, that was me, the one single person who actually didn't go see it).  Finally got around to renting the double-disc dvd and am blown away by it.  Much has already been said in praise (rightly so), of Ridley's direction, (superb, no one does it better), the effects (unbelievably good looking, in all respects; they may have not built Rome in a day, but came pretty damn close); the lighting, the score, the action/battle/coliseum scenes, the costuming, all of it magnificent and appropriately sweeping and grandiose.  For me, however, its' the acting that makes the movie.  Russell Crowe as Maximus is terrific, (particularly in the more sensitive aspects of his character, as when he dreams of home and family); and everyone else, including Richard Harris in his final role, fantastic; even the child actor, Spencer Clark, as heir to the throne Lucius, does a nice job in tunic and English accent.  For me, though, the scene stealer was Joaquin Phoenix as the arrogant, jealous, incestuous, chilling, pathetic, wholly mad Emperor Commodus.  We can see his health and grip on sanity decline as the movie progresses; his pallor becomes more and more pasty, his eyes become more and more sunken with dark circles beneath as his hold on Rome slips, and his paranoia and irrationality grow.  The infamous \\"Busy bees/AM I NOT MERCIFUL????!!!!\\" scene really sends shivers! <br /> <br />I also wanted to comment on the extras included in the double disc set on the dvds.  There are some great features on this.  My favorites are the behind-the-scenes specials, detailing the special effects, the fight choreography, the architecture, the history of the gladiator games, etc.  There are interviews with many of the creative folks involved, including with most of the actors, and they are all delighted to be doing what they doing, most of them playing around and joking in the interviews.  (Russell Crowe laughs about being so close to live tigers in some of the arena scenes, and then being told he shouldn't play a \\"girlie-game\\" like soccer because of the risk involved; Joaquin Phoenix told of riding into the coliseum via chariot, as Ceaser Commodos, waving to the crowd in a \\"regal\\" manner, all the while thinking \\"Who am I kidding, I'm from Florida\\".) It's little insights like that which makes it that much more interesting, at least for me. <br /> <br /> <br />My favorite part of the bonus material is a written movie journal by the young actor Spencer Clark; the child really is very bright and articulate and I was impressed with his descriptions of the filming process and life as a child actor.  He's really quite observant and insightful and made friends with everyone on the set. His reactions to what was going on around him, the enormity of it all, with the same kind of excitement and fascination that us laymen probably would.  I liked his behind the scene pictures too, including of Crowe and family and \\"mates\\" at a cricket match/barbecue, and teaching Spencer some naughty limericks. (Spencer got him back later with some of his own.)  He teased Phoenix about his costume being a \\"dress\\", and also commented on a scene he filmed with Phoenix and himself where a sword Phoenix as Commodus was leaning on slipped, and Phoenix was professional enough to continue with the scene with a straight face and saved the take. He was so into the character, so intense, that that little mistake made it into the movie and it seemed \\"right\\", somehow. These kinds of things can't be scripted, they happen by accident and can either be a ruined take or add a tiny nuance to the character. Spencer Clark was very impressed with Joaquin, and so was I (even more so!) upon learning this little tidbit. <br /> <br />The dvd earns the five stars I've given it.  Wow, is all I can add. <br /> <br />Watch the movie, enjoy the extras.  This is a good one, a rare one.  Highly recommended. <br />
0451191153|3.0|As a book, The Fountainhead can be an excellent fast-paced novel, fully of certain insights and provocative situations and themes. <br /> <br />But as someone who flirted with Objectivism before coming to my senses early on, thankfully, it is very hard to separate the philosophical faults from the novel itself. <br /> <br />Whether you care about the philosophy or not, it is a good book to read, even if for the simple reason that you may argue against Objectivism and know something about it.  But the words in the novel, at times uplifting, ultimately become stilted because of the overbearing philosophical points Rand wants to make.   <br /> <br />Rand herself makes little distinction between her novels and the preaching of her philosophy itself.  In the same way, this review is also a warning to those who might be inticed by Objectivism.  There are excellent points to the philosophy, but for someone to extrapolate an absolute morality from the tenants of Objectivism is, in the same way religion has always been, out to control and convert.  As someone studying to be a scientist, the merits of her philosophy simply do not coincide with how the world works, and the tenants pervert the Aristotilian concepts she so praises.  The history of laissez faire capitalism is also wrought with evidence that \\"hands off\\" simply won't do.   <br /> <br />It is a great book to read, but don't become absorbed by Rand's persona.  Please make it a point to dig up the sordid history behind Objectivism, Nathaniel Branden and Rand, and, most importantly, think for yourself.
B0002YLC24|5.0|I was initially hesitant when I heard about this movie, a follow-up to \\"Before Sunrise\\". After hearing such great reviews, I finally watched it. I am so happy that I did. This movie was as touching as the first, as wonderfully acted and as naturally fulfilling. It seems like such a simple idea - two people reunite years after a brief romantic encounter. But, this movie grabs you and pulls you into the emotional realm of all the feelings of \\"what could have been\\" and \\"what ifs\\" like no movie I've seen before. It puts life and love in a refreshing perspective. It's almost impossible to not be able to relate to this story on some level or another as well as (perhaps) stirring up personal uncertainties and emotions.  Yet, it's so simple and so beautifully played out.  <br /> <br />Like \\"Before Sunrise\\", this movie follows Celine and Jesse as they walk & talk. I was impressed with the realism of the characters and that the same style was followed as before. Also, it was refreshing to see that the characters had developed and matured since the last movie; each with his or her own set of problems, uncertainties and life issues. It didn't just start where it left off, yet you could feel the connectedness they shared and never really lost. <br /> <br />As for the ending (I won't spoil it), I've seen other comments accusing it of being vague. I thought the ending was perfect and its ambiguity was the best route Linklater could've taken. There was a feeling of \\"are they or aren't they\\" throughout the movie (in regards to rekindling their love, ending up together, etc.) and I felt that the ending fit just right for that scenario. <br /> <br />If you enjoyed \\"Before Sunrise\\", you will love this movie. It's touching, smart, funny and thought-provoking.
B000002UC5|3.0|Despite the sour feelings between the Fab Four and Paul's being blamed for \\"throwing in the towel\\" as it were by announcing that The Beatles were through, this homemade solo album was released to mixed critical acclaim and worldwide sales. As a musical one man show it is spectacular, but the material leaves a lot to be desired and the only really great song is the scorching ballad \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\". Yet, \\"McCARTNEY\\" offers a lot of guilty pleasures: the slop-rock of \\"Oo You\\", the sweet instrumental \\"Hot As Sun\\", a great pop number (\\"Every Night\\"), a couple of leftover Beatle rejects (\\"Junk\\" and \\"Teddy Boy\\"), and a slew of engaging little ditties like \\"That Would Be Something\\" and \\"The Lovely Linda\\". Taken all together, \\"McCARTNEY\\" is a slight but utterly charming snapshot of Paul's no-frills talent. HIGHEST POP ALBUM CHART POSITION: Number 1.
B000003TBP|5.0|This album was really fantastic when it came out, and nearly a decade haven't changed my opinion (or that of many others). Beck and The Dust Brothers put together a unique set of tracks that rival those on any other album, EVER. <br /> <br />No, it isn't some contiguous set of related tracks - no album oriented rock here, folks. It is just pure fun an invention, and yet it still works - even with all the different sounds and styles. <br /> <br />It's hard to pick a favorite or least favorite track - they are all consistently great.  <br /> <br />That's beautiful, Dad.
0385510454|5.0|Joel Backman is THE BROKER in Grisham's latest novel.  A high profile DC lawyer sent to prison after his arrest for attempting to broker a deal involving a stolen satellite system.  Suddenly, and inexplicably pardoned after six years of a 20 year sentence, by a clueless President at the behest of the crooked CIA Director, Backman is left wondering why?<br /><br />Spirited off to Italy so he can start his new life and be set up to get killed by the countries offended in the never completed satellite deal, Backman slowly comes to realize he is in real danger.  Dodging and weaving the CIA and foreign intelligent officers in typical Grisham fashion takes up the bulk of this short novel.  All the tension is derived from avoiding scrutiny.<br /><br />A fast read, this THE BROKER is not as complex as early Grisham works.  Recommended reading with a rare happy ending.
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />It has been almost 8 years since U2 last released an album of original music - Pop, the aural splendor of their shined innovation - but they don't even care about that.  There is a lot of self-indulgence, as they seem to be happiest than ever, hidding behind trademarks and hype, and of course mindless fans love that. It's apparent that U2 could settle comfortably numb into middle age, closing out their career keep delivering a series of All That You Can't Leave Behind albums and no one from their paid media - as Rolling Stone, Mojo, Billboard, Time, etc - would complain about that at all. <br /> <br />Some people don't notice the big difference between the BEST album and the MOST POPULAR. Not even close. The Cure, Franz Ferdinand, Bjork, Keane, Green Day, Modest Mouse, Brian Wilson, The Mars Volta, The Wrens, Air, Max Ritcher, Secret Machines, Clinic and countless artist released far better albums than this hyped product. Of course, U2 was the most popular among bands. <br /> <br />How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb is one of the worst pieces of crap I've had the misfortune to listen to. Aside of the extremely poor quality of the songs - mainstream, safe, dull, silly, pointless, boring, filled with clich rhymes and repetitive music - the poor selection - they had a pretty decent stuff ( Xanax And Wine, Mercy and other ones ), and everything else wrong the the content they have to go and make the cover art look just like crap.  <br /> <br />At this point though I took a long, hard look at this crap and had to tell myself that we are seeing the end of U2 as a MUSIC band.  <br /> <br />Bono still believes he's the new John Lennon... give me a break, John Lennon became an ARTIST by unselling himself... WHAT A DIFFERENCE WITH THIS FACELESS LIAR. Bono and his corporation are selling millions of records despite having not one stitch of vocal nor creative talent. I don't think selling out means maturity, it means weakness, giving up and total loss of artistic value andprinciples.  <br /> <br />The lack of memorable songs is evident from the first listen of the album. They just needed a 3-minute promo video filled with sunglasses and Bono's screaming face, mixed with countless close-ups and silly \\"special effects\\" to get as money as possible once more.  <br /> <br />If you want to be a hero well just follow me - John Lennon.
0385510454|3.0|I listened to the unabridged audio version of The Broker. And while I enjoyed I found it to be an average read. I knew from Grisham's past works that his despicable protagonist would reform and overcome his problems. And the Broker was no exception. What bothered me most was that very little actually happened. Joel goes to cafes. He hangs out with his tutors. He learns Italian. He eats food I cannot even name. He falls in love with a woman, and avoids bad guys.<br /><br />This was a good book, but its hardly a four star effort. It might be nice if it were labeled a 'cozy' mystery. More time was spent touring italy and drinking cappucino  than pursuing justice or fighting bad guys. Average. But not Great. Three Stars.
B0001ZMWQO|1.0|oh  wow   check this out  there european  and they went to an art school !!!   listen to the boring  disco \\"art\\" crap they make its soo great !  oh man and they wear ties tooo  oh man   <br /> <br />what is wrong with people   !?!?!?
B00005LOUP|3.0|This movie, which was painful to view especially with my 7 year old present, totally destroyed the spirit of Dr. Seuss. In his book the Grinch was a Grumpy old person who just wanted in the end that the people like him. In this dark comedy we get a vicious beast that tries to kill a little girl without a thought. The same beast is sought after by a sex craved woman. <br /> <br />The director tried to rip off the Munchkin Land (a la Wizard of Oz) look of the town and does a real poor job of it. There is a lot of camp in this movie which is really poor quality (maybe the director should have watched some old Batman on TV to find out how to get it right). <br /> <br />If you are taking the kids I suggest Rugrats in Paris which is a thoroughly entertaining film for both children and adults. It is also one that you can feel safe taking the smaller kids to unlike this muddled affair.  <br /> <br />
B000001EPB|5.0|I am 15 years old and  I remember the first time I heard this music only a year from now. When I heard Cry of the Celts for the first time, I knew I had to get the CD. No regrets at all, because this music is just wonderful, and a year later, I still listen to it with fresh ears.     Here's my opinion of each song:  1. CRY OF THE CELTS: This was the first song I heard from this CD at a neighbor's house, and I fell in love wiht it instantly. It's one of my favorites on the CD,  and even if it starts off with  a strange beginning, it gets better as the song progresses. Love the flute part of the song.  2. SULA RUIN: A Celtic vocal, with lovely lyrics  3. CELTIC DREAM: To be honest with you, when I first heard this song, I was completely annoyed and tired of this repetitive, slow, tiring music. But, now, I love it, a lot, and the music is beautiful. It really calms you down, and I could play this at night, it sounds like a heavenly lullaby. Beautiful music, but takes patience to listen to completely.  4. WARRIORS: This was one of the best on the CD, my third favorite in fact. Each part was wonderful and special, but the last part of the song will have to be my favorite. I could dance to this song over and over!  5. GYPSY: This song is definitely my favorite song out of the entire CD and I could play it over and over, without ever getting tired of its breathtaking music. It sounds so sensuous, so beautiful. The only problem I have with this one, is that it's too short, and I wish they could have added a little more to this song.  6. BREAKOUT: One of the best in the CD. I didn't like how it started,but it gets MUCH better as the song progresses. I watched the Lord of the Dance video, and my opinion: This would sound much better, with the taps.  7. LORD OF THE DANCE: It's pretty good, and I'd say it's great, and once again, not the best of beginnings but, gets better as the song continues.  8. SPIRIT IN THE NEW WORLD: Honestly, what the heck is this?This is supposed to bea song? Basically the only disappointment, I almost always skip this song. The only good thing about this song is that it only last one minute and ten seconds...   9. FIERY NIGHTS: I'm still trying to figure out how saxophone music got mingled in here with Celtic music, but okay...They still manage to make it sound good, surprisingly, and even though it may not be my top favorites, i still enjoy it every now and then.  10. LAMENT: This song is strictly violin music. Very deep, emotional, okay.  11.SIAMSA: I listen to this song a lot lately. I like how there's so many moods to this song, and as the song progresses, it just gets better and better. It's just too modern for me though.  12. OUR WEDDING DAY: Why this song? On Lord of the Dance, they had another song called, \\"She Moved Through the Fair\\". That song was much better than this one.   13. STOLEN KISS: The first part of the song is so sweet, but the second half of the song, sounds rather familiar...  14. NIGHTMARE: Good song, and rather dark and haunting. You could almost feel chills through your body from the song.  15. VICTORY: The song is good  altogether,and I love the grand beginning as much as I love the second part. The song is just fantastic and energetic and almost perfect.   16 and 17 is Cry of the Celts and Lord of the Dance with taps. The taps help me to imagine the dancers crystal clear, and it's very good.    In conclusion, this CD left me with very little disappointments, and no regrets, and if you love music full of energy and emotion, you'll love this music without a doubt.
6305657947|3.0|Don't know whether the intention of the story was to highlight Rene Russo's breasts or to make you like an obvious criminal. The movie was totally disjointed and difficult to follow. You have an intricate plan to rob an art museum at the beginning that was nothing but a ruse so Bronson could heist a painting that we are never sure whether he wanted in the first place. He seems to like to live life on the edge and is more concerned with the challenge of doing something (betting $100,000 on a virtually impossible golf shot) than the actual result. <br /> <br />At the start Russo is shown as a sexy super sleuth that seems to have everything figured out from the minimum of clues. I was totally in the dark as to what she actually was (an insurance investigator perhaps?). I found her annoying more than sexy throughout the movie. Overall I was very disappointed with this film.  <br /> <br />
6305313687|5.0|I stumbled upon American History X on the Independent Film Channel, and it has forever changed my outlook on life. The first thing that captured my attention in this film was the acting. I have always been a HUGE fan of Edward Norton and have seen every one of his movies, but his performance as Derek Vinyard blew me away. Asside from Primal Fear, this is Norton's best piece of work to date.  <br /> <br />As for the film itself, there is nothing that can be said to acuratly describe the power of it, except that it is a definate MUST-SEE. <br /> <br />Though X is extremely graphic and for mature audiences only, it is easily one of the most influencial and underrated films of our time.
B000031WD9|5.0|This was one of the best teen flicks I have seen since Fast Times at Ridgemont High. Eugene Levy is hilarious as the nerdy horny father who is always helping his son. <br /> <br />But I guess I won't be sending any of my kids to \\"band camp.\\"  <br /> <br />
B00064AM6C|4.0|How many people do you know that dismiss \\"The\\" bands at the drop of a dime. The Hives, The Vines, The Strokes... there all the same to several people. But with any new/popular style, you get the groundbreakers, one of which is The White Stripes. The garage rock revival has brought a lot of great music to people who felt suffocated by the nausea infested, overproduced pop music, with little to know substance. \\"Under Blackpool Lights\\" shows Jack White as the blues/rock guitar god that he is.<br /><br />Despite the presence of any special features whatsoever, the concert rocks enough on it's own to justify the purchase. The sound is excellent, and the picture is so-so, which gives you that real \\"garage rock\\" feel. It's just Jack and Meg up there, rocking the show to it's fullest. Jack jams out a hell of a show, belting out solos flawlessly. Meg is her usual self, swaying her head around in tranquility, feeding off of the energy that Jack puts forth. The unity between the two really stands out.<br /><br />The White Stripes are the real thing. Here is the proof.
B000059Z8M|5.0|Here is a sequel that equals its predecessor in sheer enjoyment. Wonderful new characters make the story fresh. Loved all the references to Star Wars. I will be one of the first to purchase the video when it comes out. Hope that this is only the first in a long line of sequels or possible television series.  <br /> <br />
B00004STW3|3.0|Mar's Attacks is a comedy/Sci-Fi/action adventure film with a multi-talented star cast in a world where Jack Nicholson is the president of the United States.  The country lets down its guard to accept the Martian Ambassador only to be surprisingly attacked by the Martians on national television.   <br /> <br />If that seemed rather foolish, then it should be no surprise to you that the Martians offer to publicly apologize to the United States in front of Congress, and as you can probably predict, another surprise attack wipes out the Congress of the United States.  I never stopped being shocked at the ways the Martians treated their captives or at seeing the star cast die at the hands of the Martians. <br /> <br />It was bad enough to see the United States with their pants down to the attacks.  Then the President of France calls the President of the United States bragging that he had negotiated a Martian peace treaty.  Of course the President of the United States, at this point in time, began to suspect the Martians of being nothing less than obliterators of the human race and tried to warn the French President however it was too late.  <br /> <br />The final attempt to make peace with the Martians comes when they bust into the White House to greet the President and what is left of his staff.  I will let you watch the movie to see what happens in this scene. <br /> <br />The hero of this movie is bound in a quiet teenage male named Richie (Lukas Haas) who strives to obtain his parents' acceptance after the Martians murdered his brother.  Richie is especially interested in saving his grandmother, who helps him to save the world against the Martians. <br /> <br />This movie, for me, is like several of Tim Burton's other films in that the animated actors in this film seemed to find their way into my heart.  No wonder human kind can be so trusting and believing.  I give this movie three stars because I felt the repetition of the gullible nature of humans really should have sank in after the first two times.  I found the movie slightly humorous and I will watch it again...sometime in the future. <br />
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I don't really have too much to say about Collateral.  It's the first time I've seen Jamie Foxx in a serious role, and I was impressed.  Tom Cruise's performance as a bad guy assassin was also pretty good.  I liked how matter-of-fact his character was.  Case in point, when Max says, \\"You killed him.\\" And Vincent responds with the very matter-of-fact, \\"No, I shot him.  The bullets and the fall killed him.\\"  Loved it!  That's such a fantastic line. <br /> <br />I'm not totally into action movies, so I really have nothing to compare this to.  Oh, unless I count Kill Bill Vols. 1 & 2, but I will not even go there.  Okay, so I thought the plot was good.  I don't think it was very well explained, but then again, I really don't know what to expect from movies like this.  It took me a long time to figure out how the movie was making a full circle, however the person I watched with figured it out almost immediately. <br /> <br />Considering all points, actors/acting, plot build-up, predictability I rate this movie 4 out of 5 stars.  I recommend it, but if you're a huge fan of movies like this, I wouldn't take my opinion to mean much. <br />
B0001AP12G|5.0|I slept on this joint for a minute. Kanye is one of the last to respect what hip hop is, was and what it could be if someone actually cared about more than the $$$. I was pleasantly suprised by the album. I purposely didn't buy this CD because of the slow jamz cut but because of the numerous complex layers and the attention to detail that is evident in it, slow jamz became one of my fav cuts on the album. This guy is a rare talent that only comes along once in a great while. Cop the album!!! Kanye, can we get the instrumentals???
B000002UJQ|5.0|A lot of complaining that we only listen to this album because the critics like it. <br /> <br />We are the critics. <br /> <br />Five stars.
B0002OERI0|5.0|<br />Green Day took the old U2 way, I mean, Tree Chords and The Truth. <br />Great album, great lyrics as well. THIS IS MUSIC, not silly iPod commercials nor sunglasses !!!! stupid posers.  <br /> <br />Green Day show U2 how to make music with credibility and commitment. While U2 are completely sell outs, Green Day dare to talk about the things as they are, without stupid videos, lies, without propaganda, marketing machine, cowboy hats, etc. Yet Green Day are at the top of the Billboard Chart , whereas U2 falls every week ( for now they are at 13th place ).   <br /> <br />That's what you got when you have George W. Bush as your close friend, Bono. <br /> <br />
B00064MW6K|1.0|Halle Berrys portrayal of \\"A Catwoman\\" named Patience Phillips is disgraceful - I can't belive this woman won an oscar. Catwoman is a dark character, not a camp, badly scripted joke. Her outfit is ridiculous - as if she could jump around with that horrific ensemble on \\"certain things would pop out\\" not to mention she has four ears. I am so glad that they changed her name from the comic book character Selina Kyle which I as a huge Catwoman fan loves. Michelle Pfeiffer played the role of Catwoman perfect in Batman Returns, to think that anyone would even try to step into her stilleto's is a joke, but this film is just a complete insult to the audience. It gives us cat owners a bad name. Halle berry should definetly be put out with the kitty litter, in the end I wanted Sharon Stone to whip out an Icepick and kill her. Do yourself a favour and watch Batman Returns if you want to see the real Catwoman.
B0006399FS|1.0|<br />Like most re-unions, it turns out to be a better idea in theory than in practice. Disastrous \\"All That You Can't Leave Behind\\" wasn't bad enough, Bono?. U2 are ruining their legacy by releasing crap like this and over-commercializing everything they've been doing since 2000. After Pop they are too scared to take a chance on anything they may not be able to sell or play at a super bowl.  <br /> <br />Bono once passed a piece of advice for 40-year-old rock stars: \\"please cut your hair\\". So what about his own receding hairline ?.  <br /> <br />Are some of you here u2 diehards that listen to nothing else but U2 ? So you spend 4 years waiting for your next fix and when the albums released you think its amazing just because its a U2 album ? Lets be realistic: U2 aren't what they used to be. People comparing this album with Unforgettable Fire & Achtung Baby should get their heads examined.  <br /> <br />It's a very worrying fact that U2 have released 2 poor albums in a row. Neverthless This All That You Can't Leave II cocktail is easily worthy of Grammy album of the year. U2 already bought every media as Rolling Stone, Billboard, Grammy, Time, Mojo, etc. <br />Both fans and media are almost afaid to criticize new product from this sell out band. Every U2 move must be \\"cool\\": even the annoying U2/Apple relationship. The \\"Vertigo\\" ( what an original name!!!  as stupid and uncreative as the album itself, and all the videos they have done since Beautiful Day ) Tour surely will be just another Elevation Tour - DVD included of course - , but some blinded fans don't care about that, they MUST catch U2 live, that rocks !!!!! Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah... <br /> <br />Steve Jobs surely will be happy - as Bono, to sell U2 on iTunes. <br /> <br />songs like Please, Mofo, Gone, Do You Feel Loved, Zooropa or The Wanderer blow away all this sell out era. Listen To Zooropa and Pop instead. Leave these sell outs liars on their own. Let them rot themselves. <br /> <br />U2 1980-1999 <br /> <br />
B00005K9LN|3.0|If you were new to Jusas Priest back in 1980 you probably thought this was a killer album . If you were familiar with the groups earlier work , you were probably a  bit dissapointed but not surprised , if thier previous effort Hell Bent' was an indication where the band was heading . Its got a lot of pop songs on it - Living After Midnight , Breaking The Law , Metal Gods , United .. etc .... but it does have a few great tracks on it that make it worth buying . Stealer ,Ginder and The Rage are all great Priest tunes , Rapid Fire in my opinion is the lps strongest track . Its ferocious.. Its a song that represents the course Priest should've ( but didnt take ) in the 80s . I hate to give this 3 stars, because for any other metal band its a 4 1/2 - 5 star album , But to me its the first Priest album that has them falling in with the pack instead of being at the forefront of it .
B00030590I|3.0|Hero is a beautiful film. The saturated color of the costumes,autumn leaves, mountain lakes, painted deserts and palaces was superb. The martial arts scenes were amazingly directed, best described as surreal ballet in fast motion. <br /> <br />The plot is interesting, changing direction three times, and thus keeping the viewers on their toes. The story is related first through the eyes of Jet Li, an assassin acting like a provincial officer. His story of the deaths of three assassins certainly has internal consistency. However the Emperor is too wise to fall for a coherent story. The Emperor then relates his suspected version of the deaths of the 3 assassins. The Emperor's story unmasks Jet Li, but the plot takes one last twist as Jet Li tell the third variation of the complicated dance of revenge, attraction, rage, and trust. <br /> <br />The film left me very disturbed however in that the underlying philosophy is that the stability of the state, even a state created by a blood thirsty tyrant, is of such value that individuals must sacrifice their lives for the unity of China. Whereas this concept may be acceptable in China where the authority of the state must be preserved at all costs, is far different from the political philosophy of the United States where citizens can rebel and react against tyranny.  <br /> <br />The film is beautiful but in the end it is a creature of another culture and political philosophy from our own.
B00006879E|3.0|Throughout the entirety of 'Songs About Jane,' many loud echoes are heard. And whether it's the echo of Hoobastank, Counting Crows, Dave Matthews, or even pop punks Blink-182 (all of which appear), the swipes from earlier, better boy-based groups become tiring after the first few songs. The lead singer's obnoxious vocal stylings are the disc's most fatal plummet into mediocrity. The disc is plagued with his whiny warbling, drawing out of each and every syllable, and vocals tinged with an irritating fake accent. It doesn't help that their songs were obscenely overplayed on radio. The infectious hooks are all that save this from being a total disaster. The sassily catchy \\"This Love\\" is easily the best track. The album's only highlights are its singles, so every worthwhile song here made it on radio. \\"She Will Be Loved\\" is another memorable tune-it is very catchy, and the lyrics are sweet. But the way the dude pronounces 'will' might just drive a few people insane. \\"Harder To Breathe\\" is some funky fun, and the somewhat soothing, almost-ho-hum \\"Sunday Morning\\" is alright. The last genre I would label this as is 'rock and R&B'.....it's punky pop, along the same lines as Blink-182 and Avril Lavigne. So, if you can ignore the aggravating vocals and repetitively sexual/lovesick lyrics, 'Songs About Jane' should be a fair but not quite great listen.
B000001H00|5.0|If you're going to have one recording of the Bach Sonatas and Partitas, this is it. Milstein was about 70 when he recorded these, and they are technically flawless. I defy you to find another recording with such perfect intonation through the double- and triple-stopping, and such flawless rhythm and bowing. They sound like a young violinist, a Joshua Bell, but Milstein was bringing a lifetime's experience and thinking about Bach and about these sonatas.  <br /> <br />If you're not a violinist, you may not know how difficult these are to play, and yet Milstein is so far past the technical challenges and deep into the music. Compare this to the Perlman recordings, which have their moments but overall come off wooden and brittle by contrast.
0062502182|4.0|This light, easy to read novel is great for someone who needs to see life again through the eyes of a young adult. There is just enough adventure so that you do not get overwhelmed and it will lift your spirit after a trying period in one's own life. Thank you Mr. Coelho, it was a great read on my short vacation.
0316666343|1.0|I'm sorry - I know a lot of people really like Sebold's book, \\"The Lovely Bones,\\" but I think it's one of the most falsely soothing, idiotic and oversimplified narratives in decades. <br /> <br />First of all, how can you write a book about a young girl in heaven without any real mention of God? I'm not saying the book should be religious, but if you're going to put your protagonist in a place called \\"heaven\\" and if much of the conflict emerges from her unjust death, why is there no mention of the architect of this heaven? Why is the justice of her early death never questioned? Why is everything so calmly accepted accept for the living's problems with the protagonist's physcial earthly absence?  <br /> <br />This lack of any kind of real questioning of the situation is what makes this such a surface skimming of these issues. How can one look at the murder of a child and not question the presence of an all loving and all knowing God? This is THE issue that comes out of the conflict but it's never addressed or even brought up. How false!!!!! <br /> <br />What we're left with is a plethora of pseudo-emotional claptrap. Everyone tries to medicate their pain by flinging themselves into the arms of another - whether that be another lover, another child, etc. Wow - that's deep, Ms. Sebold. <br /> <br />The final possession scene is only saccharine sugar on top of this sour ice cream Sunday. Moreover, just look at the book's friggin' title. Lovely Bones - why \\"lovely\\"? Can't we come up with a more descriptive adjective that \\"lovely\\"? For example: <br /> <br />Q: How was that piece of cake? <br />A: Lovely.  <br /> <br />Q: How are your dead daughter's bones?  <br />A: LOVELY!!!? <br /> <br /> <br />For anyone who absolutely adored the movie \\"Ghost\\" and wants to read about the same darn thing with a little girl spirit instead of a guy and for anyone who hates to ask real questions about painful situations, this book is for you. If you actually have a brain and a heart, don'twalk - RUN - away from this horrible, horrible, horrible book!!!!!!!!! <br />
B0000009TT|5.0|Zappa had originally intended this album to be released as a four LP set back in 1977 but Warner Brothers decided not to release it for various reasons I won't get into here.  Instead, they got Zappa to divide the original Lather album into four separate albums, often with different arrangements and mixes:  Zappa in New York, Studio Tan, Orchestral Favorites and Sleep Dirt, and a few songs found their way onto Sheik Yerbouti too.  Warner Bros. also decided not to pay Frank for his work.  So Zappa played the entire Lather album over the radio airwaves from which countless bootlegs have been made.  Ha ha Warner, you greedheads.  So finally, years later we get an official release of Lather, Zappa's magnum opus and arguably his best album and it was worth the wait.<br /><br />Every style Zappa ever did is on this record... from the stupid:  T*tties 'n Beer, to the sordid:  Honey, Don't You Want A Man Like Me?, to the sublime:  RDNZL, from the idiotic, to the intelligent, to the indescribable.  There are ridiculous comedy songs, social satire, bizarre and rocking instrumentals.  Some of the comedy/satire like Trying To Grow A Chin or T*tties 'n Beer are puerile, and their power to amuse wanes with each play. Though I still get a big kick out of Punky's Whips, a story of drummer Terry Bozio's infatuation with a picture of Angel lead guitarist Punky Meadows mostly because I remember the poster from Creem magazine.  Yeah it was a pretty girly picture, poor Terry;)  But the best songs and especially the instrumentals, of which there are a great deal, are among the best things Zappa has ever done and reward repeated listenings.  They range from 20th century classical serious, to silly, to jazz, to obscene rock guitar workouts a la Filthy Habits.  Lather is all over the map and is utterly amazing.  Could anyone not familiar with Zappa realize that one guy wrote all this widely varying material?  I don't think they would guess. Anybody who says Zappa is not a genius, or composer worthy of note, or a great guitarist should be forced to sit through this album, it just might change their opinion.  So Spike Jones, Edgar Varesse and Jimi Hendrix walk into a bar...ser worthy of note, or a great guitarist should be forced to sit through this album, it just might change their opinion.  So Spike Jones, Edgar Varesse and Jimi Hendrix walk into a bar...
0345350472|5.0|It's rare for something so hyped and well known to be this good. Almost all of Philip K. Dick's books are thought-provoking and enjoyable. However, in \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\" (or \\"Bladerunner\\" if you prefer), the author went beyond his usual brilliance to hit upon a work of genius right up there with \\"Man in High Castle.\\"  <br /> <br />The story centers on the theme of artificiality and what that means. Is an artificial human really human? An artificial animal? An artificial God? That Dick even asks such complicated questions is incredible, but that he answers them in such a simple yet powerful way is unfathomable. <br /> <br />Perhaps most telling is the scene with the dead spider. How one can get so worked up about a dead arachnid is almost impossible to believe - yet it happens in both character AND READER! This book really opens one's eyes to the difference between origin (or how a thing comes to be) and importance (or what value a thing has).  <br /> <br />One final note: Ridley Scott's famous movie version of the book is much different than the text. Though, Scott adds some very interesting and influential touches in his film that should not be ignored, it's really Dick's text that is the masterpiece. Read Dick first, and then see the movie.  <br />
B000065PUE|5.0|Not too much remains to be said about this album so I'll stay brief and not comment on the individual songs which you've all heard by now. Clearly 'Doolittle' is being viewed in retrospect as one of the most influential albums on the current modern rock scene. Most credit this as having impacted the sound of Nirvana and grunge in general. That makes sense given the rawness, the upfront presence of the bass and the complete rejection of big hair and lame fashion gimics. Many also see this as a jump-off point for modern punk. This is also logical given the jaggedness, the afore-mentioned raw energey and the rapid, straight-to-the-point approach. <br /> <br />Like most albums credited as being influential, it had its own influences that are more easily forgotten. With this album Pixies polished up a sound that bands like Husker Du and The Buzzcocks had cultivated for more than a decade while intentionally avoiding elements that would have crossed them over into alternative hitmakers; That's not meant as a knock on Pixies or Husker Du or anyone, rather just a statement of fact. It's also funny to note that Jane's Addiction's 'Nothing's Shocking' is so easily forgotten as a major influence on grunge and modern rock primarily due to the fact that it had its more mainstream success long after it was actually released. \\"Jane Says\\" became a big hit many years after the actual release. For this reason most people remember Janes as being part of grunge when in actuality it predated that movement, and Pixies too, by years. But I digress. <br /> <br />'Doolittle' is one of the great albums of its time, creative enough to shake things up, while also pop-sensible enough to gain a larger following than its predecessors. All fans of alternative should own this as a landmark in music. It's easier to listen to than 'Surfer Rosa' and more important than 'Bossanova' or 'Trompe Le Monde'.
B0002DB52M|1.0|This film talk about a human drama. The director belives his sript is so good, that does't need scenography. The script is poor, the rithm is an agony. <br />The best of the film are the actors, but the best actor can't do so much without a good script and without scenography. <br />The main character is driven to a humiliating life, used and abused for the people of this litle village, in exchange for hidden her from gangsters and police. <br />The grand finale is nothing more than a convenient vendetta. Don't loose your time.
B0000A0DRY|5.0|Having bought the late-90s \\"remastered\\" version, I had later improved upon the sound quality with my own audio enhancing software because, let's face it, that \\"remastering\\" was utterly flat and hissy.  Yuck.  I was quite impressed to see the new version on the shelves.  Curious, I bought it and gave it a try.  RCA has done a top notch job at cleaning and restoring these.  That alone is worthy... <br /> <br />But for me, the other selling point here were the bonus tracks (that you'll find on every album.)   <br /> <br />For Surrealistic Pillow, a highly acclaimed album though somewhat tame at times compared to later albums (such as Volunteers, which is superlative in its poise and approach), keep an ear open for \\"Somebody to Love\\", \\"White Rabbit\\", \\"My Best Friend\\" (somewhat bubblegum/saccharine lyrics, but the music is to die for), \\"3/5 of a Mile in 10 Seconds\\", \\"D.C.B.A. - 25\\", \\"White Rabbit\\", and \\"Plastic Fantastic Lover\\".  These are the best, and it's amazing what doesn't date after 39 years... <br /> <br />And having seen the videos to many of these songs, one has to wonder what has happened to talent over the last 30-some years.  It seems talent has been replaced with lip-gloss, hair bleach, having a sister or more that looks like you so the cash can keep flowing in, the ability to get married and divorced within hours of each, and no real talent at all because real talent inspires individuality and creativity and those elements cannot be controlled...
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Okay, I can't stand the overuse of profanity in movies, but once I ignored that fact I really enjoyed this spoof about zombie movies.  Shaun of the Dead has a character all its own.  This movie gave me the impression that some people who really wanted to have fun while making a movie got together and did just that.<br /><br />This is like the Scary Movie spoofs, only ten times better.  Simon Pegg, besides in the movie, just seems like the kinda guy you'd like to sit down and have a beer with.  He has that \\"it\\" factor people always talk about - a universal appeal if you will.  He is great at what he does - act.  Pegg makes this movie a blast to watch, and I'll bet he made it a lot of fun to film too.  Hey Pegg, if you read this review, next time you're in Chicago, Illinois, look me up.  I'll meet ya for a brewsky.  Maybe I could write your next film.<br /><br />Kate Ashfield is well...hmmm...how do a I say this?  Easy on the eyes - does a wonderful job as Shaun's girlfriend.  She also seems like a very down-to-earth person who manages to make her role in a spoof movie still be interesting.  Not an easy task.  But that is what this movie does best; it spoofs the zombie genre without going over the edge.  You still care about what happens to the cast, and at the same time have fun watching the zombies try and eat them.  Only this amazing cast (all of you involved can pat yourselves on the back now) could pull that off.<br /><br />Buy this movie!  You'll love it.  Ignore the overkill on the F-word.<br /><br />See ya next review.
B0006IUDXA|5.0|I have been a MacGyver fan since this show first came out. Its a great show for all ages. Maybe a little hard to understand for pre-teens but its fun all around. What I liked best about the show is all the gadgets MacGyer would make to get out of a tight spot. I know most of it would probably not work today but still it's kind of on the level of CSI. Right when you think they are stumped they pull something out of their bag of tricks and they pull a Houdini and save the day. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I had low expectations for the film, so I was very surprised I liked it as well as I did. Brad Pitt as Achilles was very good, which totally shocked me. I thought he would be miscast, but it worked. O'Toole was great. The other actors were hit and miss, but on the whole it worked. The fight scenes were very good. I read Ebert's review. I disagreed. I think 100,000 men would stop and watch Hector and Achilles fight.     I've read the Illiad about ten years ago. The movie misses the irony of the gods and fates in the affairs of men angle, but the movie replaces that idea with the study of kingship, leadership and honor. Why do men follow a king into battle? Is there any good reason for war? Is love a good enough reason?     The movie is overly long, overblown and too full of itself, but it works for me. The CGI creates armies of millions instead of armies of tens of thousands, but it is minor point. The sight from the upper rooms of the city of the 1000 ships arriving on shore is pretty cool. Within its genre, I think the movie holds up well.    I had fun and that's all I ask from sandals and togas epic.
B00061QJZI|3.0|I loved Anchorman in the theatre.  I had been looking forward to the DVD release of this movie for months after seeing it.  Unfortunately, in my opinion, the \\"unrated\\" version is inferior to the theatrical version and the only way you can see the theatrical version anymore is in the crappy full-screen, pan & scan format.<br /><br />One of my favorite scenes in the movie (the boardroom scene where the news team discusses their hangovers from the previous night's party) is replaced with an alternate version that was \\"edgier\\" and \\"unrated\\", but less funny.<br /><br />Also, the only real extended part of the movie is where the \\"once beloved\\" Ron Burgundy is now down-on-his-luck, eating a cat turd in the restaurant that he used to be an honored guest in.  It's a bit much and I think it takes away from the movie (which is probably the reason it wasn't included in the theatrical version) but hey, it's \\"unrated\\" so I guess that makes it funnier right?<br /><br />But that's just my opinion. You may like the \\"Unrated, Uncut, and Uncalled For\\" version better - I just don't - but for some reason the only way I can see the version that I want to see is if it's in the retarded full-screen DVD format (why do they even make these anymore?).  It's the illusion of choice to have the \\"standard\\" and \\"unrated\\" versions available, but the way Dreamworks offers it (with no wide-screen option for the \\"standard\\" but funnier edition) there's really no choice at all.<br /><br />That's all the time I have here.  Stay classy and thanks for stopping by.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I loved this movie. In fact, I was afraid that no director would be able to produce a comparable movie. These is not Napoleon 2, or 3. This movie can never be duplicated or expanded, again. In fact, after a few minutes of its release, it had acquired the status of a Cult Classic! Don't listen to Roger Ebert. Remember how fat he was a few years ago? Now imagine how you would feel if you were  Roger in High School! He hates this movie because it actually makes fun at Roger himself. Of course, I could analyze roger in more detail, but he is not the focus of this review. Get the movie. You'll love it.
B00028U6B8|5.0|Having bought the late-90s \\"remastered\\" version, I had later improved upon the sound quality with my own audio enhancing software because, let's face it, this \\"remastering\\" was utterly flat and hissy.  Yuck. <br /> <br />For me, the selling point here were the bonus tracks (that you'll find on every album.)  These alone are great, but it's about time somebody took the job of truly remastering these classic Jefferson Airplane songs!  I think they're a tad high on the bass, but then again, Jefferson Airplane's music has always been vibrant and powerful.  The bass really only accentuates it. <br /> <br />For Volunteers, a highly acclaimed album, keep an ear open for \\"We Can Be Together\\", \\"Good Shepard\\", \\"Wooden Ships\\", \\"Meadowlands\\", and \\"Volunteers\\".  These are the best, and it's amazing what doesn't date after 35 years.
0316172324|4.0|This book makes for a very enjoyable and illuminating read, full of fascinating ideas and information. There is no explicit theory that Gladwell relies on, and neither does the book make any clear cut conclusions. This however should not be looked upon as a flaw-rather I am of the opinion that Malcolm's sheer enthusiam for genuine discovery and making these ideas accessible, makes this an extremely gratifying book to read. Gladwell is an immensely gifted writer, and his narrative skills are superb. This book is defintely worth a read.
B00005JM02|5.0|This is an excellent kidult movie. The characterization is good the story is well paced. The animation of the sharks is excellent somehow managing to be both scary and comical.<br /><br />Ellen Degeneres as Dory is the star of the movie. She is absolutely hillarious as the absent-minded angel fish. All the voice talents do a great job with excellent comic timing helped by the great writing.<br /><br />The special edition has both wide a full screen versions. they redid the scene backgrounds for the full screen version to match the aspect ratio so you the movie is not cropped.<br /><br />The intro menu on the widescreen disk is actually quite funny as well. Something you'll kids will just keep watching, watching, watching....
6305609705|5.0|Visually, 'Apocalypse Now' is one of, if not the, most incredible films I have ever seen. Cinematically it is undoubtedly a masterpiece. The pacing of the movie is remarkable. I had problems with Apocalypse Now for most of the film because I thought it was too dramatic and detached. But by the end, I was completely submerged in it. <br /> <br />Captain Willard is played by Martin Sheen. He is instructed to kill Colonel Kurtz (Marlon Brando), an apparently insane American who has broken away from the army to play a brutal God. Every character is fascinating and unsettling. Sheen and Brando are extraordinary in their disturbing roles, as is Robert Duvall as the lieutenant colonel who is at one with the war. <br /> <br />As Willard sails up the river, each place is slightly more surreal and wild than the last. The level of tension and activity rise until Willard reaches his destination. Then the story slows to almost a standstill. The final part of the movie is set apart in a mystical space. Then it all comes together. <br /> <br />Most viewers probably know that Apocalypse Now is based on Joseph Conrad's novella, \\"Heart of Darkness\\". It follows the book more closely than I imagined it would, especially in tone. However, Apocalypse Now is its own story.
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver might just edge out the White Album for second place but it is still second to Abbey Road. Revolver is a great testament to the versitility of the Beatles. The majority of the album is very, very good but a few songs sound too much like filler. However, you must get this album! Standout tracks: \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" \\"Yellow Submarine,\\" \\"Good Day Sunshine,\\" \\"And Your Bird Can Sing, \\"For No One,\\" and \\"Got to Get You into My Life.\\"
B000001EGA|5.0|An excellent work from beginning to end.It kicks off with an ode to Elton/Bernie relationship,then it journeys through the personal experiences that sealed their musical history and catapulted them into megastars.A tale about life in the London pubs,BITTER FINGERS invites you to dance while SOMEONE SAVED MY LIFE TONIGHT illustrates the relevance of the Captain/Cowboy friendship by singing out EJ's suicide attempt.The end comes grandly with the epic WE ALL FALL IN LOVE SOMETIMES/CURTAINS.A definite gem!
0792838068|5.0|Watching `Leaving Las Vegas' can be an experience that takes a gloomy sadness to the interiors of your existence and keeps you immersed in it. As human beings, we consistently put the highest premium on our being alive. Experiencing the intensity of a despondent Nicolas Cage committed to taking his life by drinking himself to death, can trigger off a question as to what can prepare someone for such an act of self-destruction. Intriguingly enough we get no clear answers though there is a clear hint as to it might have been a profound sense of loss or failure.<br /><br />Singular focus on the moribund obsessions of Cage would be gross injustice to the incredibly touching love and empathy that he shares with the lead female protagonist - Elisabeth Shue - who plays a hooker's role with levels of dexterity rarely attained. There is a very deep understanding and mutual acceptance between the two lead characters that is in many ways the true highlight of this movie. Interestingly, we see no reasons for this to exist but such is the articulacy of characterization that not even for a second does one find this profound relationship unrealistic.<br /><br />'Leaving Las Vegas' is an iconoclastic love story whose control over the audience is fascinating. Such is the brilliance of the performances that you feel a lump in your heart by the end of the movie - and this lump transcends into the depths of your being - to stay there and to remind you that unconditional love exists and so does the capability to invite your own death to walk up to you - gradually and consistently. 'Leaving Las Vegas' is a movie that would haunt you for its portrayal of love intertwined with morbid realities of life.
B0002OERI0|4.0|I was never what you would call a Green Day fan...sure I liked some of the hits off the first couple disks, but I pegged Green Day as another flash-in-the-pan 90's band like Sublime or Stone Temple Pilots. When I was given American Idiot as a Christmas gift it wasn't high on my priority list to listen to. Well just this past weekend I popped it in my stereo and I was blown away. This is not what I expected at all. I love the blend of musical elements found on American Idiot. You actually get a rich blend of punk rock and hard rock, mixed with a healthy dose of classic rock elements. This is the way music should be going. Instead of a nice, radio-friendly (i.e. boring)album, Green Day has put out one of the most innovative and addictive cd's of the new decade. The title song, which many reviewers are slamming, is the perfect tune to open the album. From the catchy chorus to the excellent drum track, and the great guitar work, American Idiot just clicks! You will not be able to get this tune out of your head! \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" is amazing. The time changes, the lyrics, the variety of muscial styles.....you just have to hear this tune. I won't waste your time with a song-by-song rundown, but let me say that after three listens all the way through...I just can't find a week song on the album. If you are looking for an answer to today's American Idol-Jessica-Ashlee-Simpson-Spears-Timberlake no-talents...then treat yourself to some music that will get your blood pumping...music that features actual musicians. Pick up American Idiot!
B0002O06N0|5.0|What a refreshing, excellent band.  That people like Ashley \\"no talent\\" Simpson exist when there are albums like this available is a testament to the limitless potential of human stupidity.   <br /> <br />Buy this CD.  Enjoy it.  Play it for all of your friends.  It is nasty and raw and absolutely fantastic, as is The Big Come Up and Thickfreakness.  Great stuff.  Original.  Five stars.   <br /> <br />
B0000047EC|4.0|I finally found and picked up ...Missouri Sky... this week. I just couldn't like Pat Metheny's stuff but this duet with Charlie Haden is a very enjoyable listen!! All of the songs are moving and by no means dull. If you're feeling mellow then get this album and just drift away...
B0002OERI0|5.0|If somebody thougth that this guys were out of bussines, you can receive a great surprise. I think that this album is musically mature, great lirycs. <br />You have to hear Jesus of Suburbia etirely to understan this record!!! <br />You'r gonna love it.
B0000E1ALR|5.0|&lt;threefurieshuntvendetta@yahoo.com> who reviewed this compilation and gave it one star obviously has a chip on his shoulder.  My thoughts are that you didn't read these reviews to get some conservative bloke's opinion on the state of the union.  Simply put, this is brilliant americana rock-n-roll.  Springsteen is a true american and crafts timeless music.  So buy this or better yet pick up some of his individual albums and let the crass reviewer go read a comic book or play a video game.
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|We are a 3 generation Mary Poppins family.  I saw it as a young child--when it first came out, grew up with the MP music books and repeated viewings of Mary Poppins.  <br />I ordered the VCR tape approximately 20 years ago at a premium price.  I am still using it.  My 3 sons grew up with Mary Poppins, learning each and every line to the songs and script.  They played \\"Mary Poppins\\".  Now my 2-1/2 year old granddaughter is the biggest fan--2-3 times a day the video is viewed.  I purchased 2 sets of the DVDs as well as the music CDs for 2004 Christmas. Our granddaughter sings to the music, knows each scene and hushes us as not to miss a particular song. She does the Spit-Spot mirror scene-hand gestures and all! <br />Mary Poppins--is wonderful!  <br />
B00005JNBQ|1.0|This movie was terrible.  I can see how it might appeal to teenagers that have no life and are entertained by stupid things, but this movie was horrendous.  There was no plot whatsoever.  There were a couple lines that may have made me smile in a better movie, but unfortunately weren't enough to make this movie worth my time.  I walked out of the movie feeling dumber and knowing that all those people that actually enjoyed the movie must be extremely immature and desperate.
B0001LJCPC|5.0|i love the kill bill saga. this series is the best movies series since the austin powers saga...hehe (still laughing)  <br /> <br />anyways this sdtk is as good (in some instances better than the first) but the first will always be the best.  <br /> <br />the hands down best track on the entire album is the 'malaguena' by salarosa chingon.  this is the ending song for the 2nd movie and it is brilliant.  i love the guitar and the melody of the song.  makes me feel funny inside. <br /> <br />the only problem (which is minor) they did not include 'ironside' this insert is just brilliant and it deserves to be on the 2nd disc.  but that is just me... <br /> <br /> <br />buy this sdtk if you love the kill bill saga and if you wanna hear great mellow music...
B0006399FS|3.0|I think this one is the second part of \\"All that you can't leave behind\\", because it sounds like an ending 90's record. It's not a bad record, we can enjoy 3 or 4 songs with new proposals. They are no more the band that surprise us taking risks with records like \\"Zooropa\\" or \\"Pop\\" even the one I mention at the beggining. <br />I recommend to buy it if you love U2 and you don't have big expectations for new proposals.
B000002RXS|5.0|Honestly, with the popularity of this opera, you would imagine the horrendously huge number of female singers tackling the role of Carmen.  With that legion of capable artists, you would also assume that they would be able to do it properly.  However, great Carmens are rare.  There are only a few of those who can feel the passion of the role, and then again there are only a handful of those who are Carmen.  Callas was such a Carmen, and nearing the end of her short but extremely illustrious career, you will find a Carmen shaded will colors of hate, of passion, of character, of pure defiance.  You can listen to this recording, and you will also find a woman lost in her own romantic confusion, in her inability to find solace in the arms of a person whom she could truly love.  That was Carmen the enchantress, and that also reflected Callas the woman very well.  With her top slowly leaving her, this would have been the perfect time to record the role, especially with the perfection she achieved with her middle and lower voices.  She may not be the natural mezzo, but she truly was a natural Carmen.  And, with the combined efforts of the brilliant George Pretre, the amazing Nicolai Gedda (perfect Don Jose), and Jane Berbie, along with the skill of the French Orchestra and Chorus, this undoubtedly is THE Carmen of all Carmens.  Her Habanera is unforgettable, the Le fleur que tu m'avais jetee is sung to perfection, and the Chanson Boheme could never be bettered by any other singer.  If you don't like Callas, you still should put this in your collection or I would probably burn you a copy and give it to you anyways for the sake of you listening to a MUST in any collection.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I saw this movie based on the hype that I had heard from friends, radio, and TV. Well I was plesently surprised with the wackyness that is Napoleon Dynamite. This kid makes you want to beat him up and feel sorry for him at the same time. Some of the quotes and pure \\"retardism\\" is truly funny stuff. I mean this kid has a pet llama that spits goop all over him when he goes to feed it!! The brother and uncle seal the deal on this classic comedy. If you like offbeat comedies such as the Royal Tennenbaums or Cable Guy I think that you will treasure this movie as I have.
B00006RCNW|5.0|So many times characters are either all good or all bad. That's not how life is. Bad people are sometimes heart-rendingly good and good people screw it up so bad you wonder if they're really gonna make it into heaven. And that's the making of a good believeable character. Enter The Shield. A great assortment of characters who blur the line. <br />Crap! Am I cheering for that guy? <br />But he's the Commish..No he isn't! <br />But I know why he's doing it! Wait it doesn't matter if he's stealing this money out of love for his family! Does it? <br />When does the new season come out again? <br />If you liked NYPD Blue before it devolved into nothingness, you'll love The Shield - it's  a million times better.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|Requiem is one of those little known movies, quietly powerful, that will leave you reeling with emotion in its wake.  Even unfeeling husks like myself will not escape unscathed.<br /><br />This is a beautifully mastered film about drug addiction, but not in standard, drugs-are-bad format.  Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) is a junkie who dreams of being a better person but still regularly hawks his mother's battered TV set for fix money.  He and his friend Tyrone Love (Marlon Wayans) and girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) decide to go into dealing, to set themselves up so that they never have to worry again.<br /><br />Sara Goldfarb (Ellen Burstyn), Harry's mother, is a lonely widow who spends her simple days watching TV, eating chocolates, and gossiping with her friends.  Until she receives a phone call saying that she has won a chance to be on television, and with this dream comes a revitalization of Sara's life.  Determined to fit into her old red dress when they call her to be on television, Sara embarks on a diet.  Unable to resist food, her only companion through her lonely widowhood, Sara goes to a quack doctor for diet pills.<br /><br />It is extremely fascinating how `Requiem' managed to tackle two separate types of addiction in one movie, blending their patterns, their cause-and-effect, and their rise-and-decline results into one sweeping expanse of cinematic pleasure.  Imbedded behind this well directed and well-photographed movie is an eerie soundtrack, with an ominous score repeated throughout the movie giving audio fuel to the increasingly horrific visuals.<br /><br />`Requiem' will leave you hollowed out, numb, aching in a profound and disturbingly vague way.  It is filled with hope and hopelessness, love and destruction, compulsion and self-defeating purposes, centered around that gaping wound called addiction.  Look for spectacular performances from Ellen Burstyn (The Exorcist), Marlon Wayans (Scary Movie 1 & 2), Jennifer Connelly (Labyrinth), and Jared Leto (The Panic Room).  Each of these actors/actresses give us their best performances to date in `Requiem', and tip your hat to the realism from the supporting cast members.<br /><br />If you watch only one movie this year, make it Requiem For A Dream, and if you only get to watch two movies, then watch this one twice.  Also of note, if this movie touches your soul the way it touched mine, go out and grab up a copy of the book `Candy', by Luke Davies.  Also themed around addiction, it uses the same despairing approach to this tender subject as `Requiem' does.  I cannot recommend this movie highly enough.  Enjoy!and Jared Leto (The Panic Room).

B00005JNBQ|5.0|Napoleon Dynamite is a movie requiring good humor, so not all people will love it.  Ratings given to this film are either white or black.  If you do not love this movie, then you will find it to be the worst film ever made.  The humor of this film is not for everyone, either you find it funny or you do not notice that a joke has been made at all.  If you begin watching this movie and are not laughing at all, I advice that you watch no further because the lame jokes you didn't laugh at are the only worthwhile points of this film.  There is no chance for character development or any deeper plot as the movie is set only in a single average day of a nerdy teenagers life.  However, the people who did laugh will notice Napoleon is a completely deadpan character lacking any emotion what so ever, this quality adds to the hilarity of the movie's jokes.  With a character like Napoleon, who needs a story?  All you need to watch this movie is a little bit of patience to wait for the next unintentional joke from Napoleon.  If you can manage through the slow moving pointless parts, the jokes are worthwhile.  If you find that the jokes are not worthwhile, it is pointless for you to watch.  Within five minutes you should know which way you will be leaning in you opinion of this film.  In truth, the first five minutes all but develop the plot to it's fullest and show you the form of humor that will be repeated the entire film.  The movie overall...is a hit or miss.  Even if you don't like the movie, you should at least watch the dance scene.  If you do not like the dance scene, you are totally beyond being helped.  You will never laugh again.  You should probably just end your life now.  Try not to be too selfish in taking your own life...at least make sure your death is not a messy one.  You parents might be a little less angry if there isn't blood everywhere...good luck. <br /> <br />
B000059PPN|3.0|This was the first Fulci movie I saw that had no zombies in it. The movie was hard to follow, you never find out what the hell is going on until the end, and even then you are never given a full explaination. The basic story is a creepy old house where in the basement creepy Dr. Fruinstein lives and has to kill victums in order to regenerate his cells. Don't ask me what the hell that means cause that is one of the lines at the end of the movie to try explaining what is going on. All in all, I enjoyed it and is watchable again. It is not gory, I mean for  Fulci, the gore is pretty average. Compared to some of Fulci's other films it is mild. If you want to see lots of the red stuff and and body parts, see Fulci's The Beyond. In my personal opinion, Fulci's greatest movie is Zombie. If you are a Fulci fan,  House By The Cemetery is decent enough. If you are not a Fulci fan, you will not like this movie.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|While it is true that my awful may be your guilty pleasure, you will probably be saving yourself some time and loot by not buying this movie. The story doesn't hold up. You won't care about the characters and their struggles. Werewolves fighting vampires? Great concept! But like so many Hollywood concepts, the story just doesn't make it sing.
B00006FDCD|3.0|I don't know about the rest of you, but I am getting sick of DVD reviews that just give a summary of the movie. If I wanted that I would go to imdb.com or some other site. People need to have a review of the DVD. It seems like almost all the reviews about this movie are just a summary, and not talking about the DVD itself. First of all the product information listed above says this DVD is 193 minutes but on the back of the DVD case it says 187 minutes. I am not sure if this is an error or if there really are six minutes of footage cut out. There is some footage cut out from the original version which I will discuss a little later. First off this DVD is presented in the aspect ratio of 1.85:1. The back of the DVD says \\"WIDESCREEN VERSION Presented in a \\"matted\\" widescreen format preserving a theatrical aspect ratio. Enhanced for widescreen TVs.\\" Okay, this doesn't make any sense. The original aspect ratio of the movie is 1.33:1 because it was shot for TV. Saying that its preserving a theatrical aspect ratio means nothing. What exactly is being preserved? Nothing is being preserved. You are actually losing information on the top and bottom of the screen just so it will fit on your widescreen TV. The result is that the picture is longer, you are losing information, and they have to zoom in on the picture a little bit so it fills the screen, which results in slight grainyness, but isn't really that noticeable. I don't understand why some people only care about if their TV screen is filled with picture. If the movie was originally shot in widescreen, that's how the DVD should be. If it was originally shot in 1.33:1 (as is the case with \\"It\\") that is how it should be. They should've at least made both versions available. <br />Now here comes the part that realy pisses me off. After part 1 of the DVD is done, you have to flip it over to watch part 2. This is okay since the movie was originally presented in two parts. It's basically two separate movies. But the thing that drives me crazy is that they cut out the ending of part 1 so that it would flow better into part 2. The original ending of part 1 shows Stan's wife screaming and then cuts to the wall in the bathroom where the word \\"It\\" has been written in blood. You can still hear her screaming and the camera slowly moves in on the blood while \\"to be continued\\" appears on the screen and you can hear laughing from the clown. Then the credits roll. On the DVD the part with the word \\"It\\" written in blood as the last shot and the clown laughing is missing, as are the end credits. Instead, they show the word \\"It\\" written in blood for a few seconds, then cut to the woman screaming for about one second then it just fades out really quickly and the DVD menu screen pops up. After the woman screams it's supposed to cut back to the word \\"It\\" and the clown laughing. The ending on the DVD is horrible. A close up of her screaming for a second then the video and audio fades out all of a sudden...Terrible. I prefer the original ending where it shows the word \\"It\\" written in blood. It was a perfect ending for part 1. Also this DVD doesn't have the opening credits of part 2. The argument that they wanted to converge both parts to make it flow like one movie isn't a good argument since you have to turn it over half way through anyway. I bet they decided to make you turn it over because they knew if they just put part 1 and part 2 together it wouldn't flow correctly. I don't understand how a DVD like this can be released. What is the logic in taking out the ending of part 1, the end credits of part 1, the opening credits of part 2, and then making you flip it over? I would have no problem with flipping it over if they showed both parts in their original entirety. The VHS and Laserdisc versions of \\"It\\" are just like the original, so why not the DVD too? Warner Bros. releases the worst DVDs in my opinion. Their cases are cardboard and their movies have almost no special features. The only special featureon here is the commentary by the director (Tommy Lee Wallace) and a few of the actors (recorded separately and then fused together to make it appear as if they were there at the same time). I found the director's commentary to be very interesting and I learned a lot. He was really fun to listen to and tells you how he did certain things in the movie. The actors' commentary was horrible. They don't really ever talk about the movie. They just talk about random things and crack jokes every fifteen seconds. I was highly disappointed when they spoke. They provide no insight. The director was the only good part about the commentary. I would have given this DVD two stars but since I love the movie (the original version) I decided to give it an extra star. My recommendation is that if you love this movie, rent the DVD to listen to the commentary but buy the VHS or laserdisc version.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|oh your gonna probably hate this movie, Hell I kinda hated this movie when I first watched it, but somehow it stuck in my damn head till I watched it bout a dozen more times. Its really acult-ish flavored movie that has cheesyness thats next to godlinesss. Reality the movie is very flawed, but a fun movie to watch. ... <br /> <br />
B00000K2UX|5.0|The best. Numero uno. Incredible. A blast. A rockin' classic. A kick b...t attitude. The list goes on. American rock as its best when you want to be in an action mood.
B00005YXZH|5.0|I love, love, love this album. Mr. Tweedy is indeed a poet. Where else in modern music do you get phrases like \\"Bible-black pre-dawn\\"? or \\"tongue tied lightning\\"? These are brilliant lines, no? Such lyrics as these and others in Yankee Hotel Foxtrot out-shine ninety-nine percent of the stuff produced today. Then add to it so much musicality.... Yes, I know, I'm raving, but only because this is truly artful music and I don't hear enough of it anymore to be casual. The fuzz introduction on I'm the Man Who Loves You is a pure Beatles resurrection. Layer upon this groovy little blues-based number some lovely, fluid lyrics sung in blissful understatement... a winning combination. And the sad motif in Ashes of American Flags is endearing. The hits, Jesus, Etc. and Heavy Metal Drummer, are fun. War on War repeats to the point of aggravation, only to break into a thoughtful and beautiful and paradoxical piece. I don't pretend to understand the entire album, but I listen to it enough to wonder. For instance, I'm not sure how the album's title relates to \\"I'm not going outside\\" and the hotness of the poor places, or watching sailors leave from an air-conditioned room, yet the continuity of abstract messages and wonderfully painted musical moments is there, like fallen leaves filling up shopping bags. And sure, there are strange noises and other elements weaved into the soundscape that initially scared the Warner record executives to reject this album, but that was their mistake. I'm sold. And isn't the customer always right?
B00005JMK0|5.0|I saw this movie back in 1985 and have been trying to locate a copy. Every year I look to see if it's available.  You have no idea how excited I was to see it listed on Amazon, I thought, I knew THEY would have it!  Well, they don't exactly have it, but just by reading the reviews I know that this movie carries it with it more than just a story, it really embodies the characteristics of a classic.  It inspires, it moves one, it challenges thought and makes one laugh.  I'm waiting for the day I get the email saying, order today!  here's to the future
B000006O7C|5.0|THIS is the Buckley CD that really makes me sad that his life was ended so early.  \\"Grace\\" was a wonderful album, but with all the great originals on that CD, it was negatively counterbalanced by schmaltzy remakes like \\"Lilac Wine\\" and \\"Hallelujah\\" that bordered on Star Search-esque karaoke... <br /> <br />\\"Sketches\\" on the other hand is almost all original Buckley penned material, and almost every track shows the listener just what could've been.  The music is more upbeat, there's less emphasis on vocal gymnastics and more attention paid to guitar sounds and just plain ol' singing.  It's more Thom Yorke than Whitney Houston this time around. <br /> <br />The second disc is filled with interesting four-track outtakes and sketches, the most interesting of which is \\"Back in NYC\\" - a cover of uber-prog band Genesis' excellent song off of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway. I would've liked to hear a more finished version of this, but as it stands it's a pretty cool little homage by Jeff to the old 70's music he loved. <br /> <br />The songs and vocals will remind you of so many different artists - Radiohead, Roxy Music, Led Zeppelin, The Smiths, King Crimson... the list goes on.  Heck, on the fantastic R&B track \\"Everybody Here Wants You\\" he even invokes a little Prince-style groove.  This guy is versatile! <br /> <br />On \\"Sketches\\", Jeff Buckley manages to take all these influences and combine them with his unique talent for what I believe is THE MUST HAVE album in the Buckley collection.
B0001Z52RU|3.0|I didn't go see this movie in the theaters. I remember seeing the trailer for it, and the audience reacted with the ever-popular war cry of \\"Video!\\" It didn't even look good enough for a video rental, to be honest. I mean, come on, Ashton Kutcher as Donnie Darko? Gimme a break.<br /><br />About a week ago, curiosity got the better of me, and I ended up renting it. The thing is, I'm almost ashamed to say it, I liked the movie. Now, I say that with a couple of caveats.<br /><br />First off, Ashton is nobody's idea of a dramatic actor and he performs about as well as you'd expect. The second thing that's wrong with the movie is that there seems to be a lot of \\"movie science\\" going on. Ashton studies caterpillars so that he can write a paper on memory loss. What?<br /><br />Regardless, there is one thing that stands out about this movie. It takes some really bizarre turns for a studio film. There are a lot of topics in here that are usually reserved for independent movies. Sexually abused children, dogs being burned alive, prison rape.<br /><br />Some of it is kinda hard to watch, but it might be worth buying used on Amazon if you can get it for under $10 and you want to own a twisted sci-fi movie. Fans of Donnie Darko will probably appreciate this movie. It's not quite as good as Donnie Darko, but it has similar themes.
B00006879E|5.0|Usually, i will hear a song on the radio, buy the album and then be dissapointed by the cd.  However, with \\"songs about jane\\" EVERY single song i absolutely love.  It has a unique and different sound, and every song is captivating.  The vocals are amazing as well as the instruments.  I definately say this album is a must buy.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I grew up with Star Wars when I was a kid and when the trilogy editions came out with the improved imaging, I knew I had to have it.  I could care less what other people rate the trilogy at because I know this is something that has fond memories for me.  Even old films like The Hobbit with no enhancements has a way about it that makes it fun to watch.  I like movies for the story and I can say that I hate Harry Potter and that will be my own decision to make but for me to blast it and give it a poor score based on factless information is a bit pathetic. <br /> <br />
B0006Z2LCE|5.0|......and it's coming on the heels of the recent 'Journey' collection.<br /><br />While I'd LOVE to see some new product from Donna, I'm always excited when a FANTASTIC hits collection is released.  This is probably the best and most comprehensive of the bunch.  While it seems as if they were going for the most complete collection of single releases, there are some questionable omissions (Winter Melody, Rumour Has It, Walk Away, Cold Love, Who Do You Think You're Foolin' & The Woman In Me).<br /><br />Also, I would've preferred the \\"single versions\\" of 'MacArthur Park' and 'Hot Stuff' instead of the \\"promotional single/extended versions\\"<br /><br />My only other gripe would be that the song credits mis-list the singles from the album 'Another Place And Time' as from 'This Time I Know It's For Real' (which is the title of the first single....NOT the album).<br /><br />Other than those minor complaints, this is a top-notch effort worthy of a place in any great CD collection
1401300901|1.0|I tried to get into this book, I really did. However, her cliched, 4th grade level writing was so distracting that I had to stop by page 50. I have friends who are english majors and would love to have their fiction published, and Ms. Ahern gives a bad name to those who actually know how to create fresh characters and believable dialogue. Recommended reading: The Birth of Venus (Sarah Dunant), The Time Traveler's Wife (Audrey Niffenegger), and if you like good chick-lit, Good in Bed (Jennifer Weiner).
B000001F76|5.0|This is Hank Williams at his best singing his best  This particular album holds a lot of memories for me  This album is the first real country music I ever heard  When I was a kid my dad had a Sony Dolby cassette player and he used to play this tape over and over again on it until it wore out  (there were two tapes)  I absolutely loved it then and I'm 20 now and still love it  Hank is the grandaddy of country and this album proves it  It's hard to narrow it down to just 40 hits  Almost every song he had was a great great song  Williams couldnt even read sheet music but boy could he write a hell of a song  If only he would have lived longer than 29....  In other words if you don't have this c.d and you love country music you need to hear this c.d!!!!  you'll be glad you did
B00000J7JO|5.0|Let me start out by saying that this cd is awesome. The first chilli peppers cd i bought and listened to was By the  <br />Way, so i started out with their mellow stuff. Don't get me wrong, i loved that cd. However, i like Californication even better than By the Way. Californication has got some really classic songs. There is nothing on that cd that i don't like. One of the biggest differences between that cd and By the Way is the beats. Maybe i'm wrong, but i felt that the beats the drummer was rippin out were much more intricate and played a bigger role in the music. I would definately reccomend Californication for anyone, if you are a Chilli Pepper fan and don't have it or if you're thinking of tryin out the Chilli Peppers definately go out and by this cd. Do it now!
0930289455|5.0|Broke down and bought a (nother) graphic novel with some Xmas gift certificate money.  I haven't been much of a Batman fan overall, but since I enjoyed _The Dark Knight Returns_ ( I remember reading my friend's copy decades ago and being impressed by the \\"pinched\\" nature of the art - on the other hand _The Killing Joke_'s art reminds me of _The Watchmen_ - in a good way) and think Moore was really one of the best writers working in the 1980s in any genre picked up this classic Batman/Joker tale that explores their symbiosis and dichotomy - their madness and how, at this point, tightly entwined it has become in the pantheon.<br /><br />The spur story of Barbara (Batgirl) Gordon getting shot and paralyzed by the Joker plays out here too (as far as the controversy - I don't believe that the Joker raped her after shooting her, but death of the author and all that and Moore does leave some ambiguity...) and although it's rough to see her treated like this, some solace is had by realize in that she will overcome the obstacle and become the much more interesting, nuanced and obsessed character, Oracle....
0446677450|5.0|This is my first review that I have written.  I have read several of  Robert's books and they are the best around.  I also have a Business Degree and a great deal of education and I'm happy to say that reading his books were more valuable (in the long run) than my BS or MBA!  Now don't get me wrong, I highly encourage education.  Here is what I did:   <br /> <br />Went to school, got good grades and a high paying job (sales and marketing position = solid pay and learning selling and communication skillls w/ others which are the most important skills in life).   <br /> <br />I then took Roberts advice and took most of the money that I made and spent it on assets (anything that puts money in your pocket-- real estate, small businesses, vending machines, stocks, ect...) and refused to purchase \\"doodads\\" (overly priced watches, clothing, boats, vacations, cars, shoes, furniture ect..).  This is the secret to wealth.  Make 80,000 and live like you make 40,000.  Spend the remainder of the money on assets for a few years and retire when your 40 a multi-millionare. <br /> <br />Then Once your rich you can buy the nice things.  Use your assets to buy your luxuries.  Most Americans use debt to purchase their luxuries.  They have it completely backwards and that's why we are such a debt ridden society.  <br /> <br />I am taking the time to write this becuase I want others to know how important this book is.  I will have my kids read it as soon as they are old enough to understand and appreciate its advice.  Robert teaches the fundamentals of \\"thinking rich.\\"   <br /> <br />This book is all about shifting your paradigm to understand how to become wealthy.  I can tell you in a few sentences how to do it, but I HIGHLY reccommend reading his book as well in order to fully engorss your self in the concept.  It will change your life!
B0002OERI0|1.0|Is pretty much what i hear, everywhere i go.  Nevermind the fact that everyone forgot about them and didn't really give a flying f*CK and haven't really since nimrod, their last half decent album. \\"American Idiot\\" to me just proves that people are sheep, and they'll like anything they're told to like. This tripe isn't groundbreaking, this is pretty much the same non-sense that Good Charlotte churns out, only with anti-bush overtones, wow, they hate Bush, thats original. P.S lose the eyeliner Billie Joe, you look like a huge fag, not to mention, an unofficial Good Charlotte member
B0002X314C|5.0|It is so nice to finally be able to buy two albums in one year that I can listen to from start to finish.  John Legend and Anthony Hamilton have created two of the hottest pure R&B albums that have been released in the past two years.  I know Usher has blown up even larger lately and I'm not saying he doesn't deserve it but.... Confessions does possess some pop elements.  So...if you are a true fan of R&B in it's purest form, I guarantee you will enjoy Get Lifted...I know my friends and I do.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Reviews for this film are overwhelmingly positive.  The people that recommended this to me were sure it's great.  NO WAY. <br /> <br />This movie isn't even a movie - I have to say that it was slightly worse than Red Zone Cuba but slightly better than Manos:  The Hands of Fate in terms of plot, jokes, and action.  (Both films are MST3k fodder; I am referring to the non-MST treated originals - obviously, the MST treatment turns these into comedy classics and invalidates this comparison.) <br /> <br />Basically, this movie is about as far from Three O'clock High (possibly the best down/out teen nerd comedy in this vein - i.e, dry as opposed to the superb Better Off Dead's more wacky approach) as one can get.   <br /> <br />Avoid this movie.  Be productive.  Don't lose 7.3 hours of your life agonizing through this one.  No, it's not really 7.3 hours long, but it feels like it.   <br /> <br />ZERO STARS.  UGH.
B00000G3PA|5.0|Armageddon is the kind of film which Hollywood does best: It's fun and flashy and at the end of the film you will shed a tear and cheer! For the English majors in the house, Bruce Willis is a Beowulfian booze guzzling character who leads his merry band of booze guzzling warriors against the demon from hell (a planet destroying asteroid. The sets on the asteroid are top notch and convey a sense of evil. The acting is better than average for this kind of genre, the editing crisp and well-paced, and the production is on the whole very slick. If you love Hollywood, and all that that implies, you will love this film.
B000002ADT|5.0|This CD may not impress you the first time you listen to it.  You may find yourself thinking, what the heck is all the fuss about.  And then a few days later you will hear a musical phrase in your imagination and you will think where did that come from.  And the answer will be Kind of Blue.  You will listen again and like it, but still not pay close attention.  This will continue forever.  And over the course of time what will change is that you will come to realize that you need this CD.  Your life was not all that it was intended to be prior to hearing this CD.  That the combination of Miles Davis and Bill Evans was one of those alchemical moments when two elements (both already gold) are brought together and create something inexpressibly wondrous.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|This is an amazing album.  It really excites me that there are actually some good bands like this still out there.  Arcade fire is like a flashback to when rock and roll had a natural energy that was undeniable, and they capture that energy perfectly on this album.  Although they do have a sort of vintage 70s rock meets 80s punk sort of sound, they still sound completely original and completely fresh.  You would probably never mistake them for some band from twenty years ago that you'd never heard before.  They are certainly influenced by the past, as all artists should, but they don't seem to have any trouble making the sound their own.  The entire album is great, and I hope to hear more out of this band very soon.
B0002O37RM|4.0|I came to Charlie Haden's music via Nocturne a couple of years ago.  With much of the cast back for this recording I find it enjoyable, but a little disappointing.  Nocturne seemed able to maintain a slight edge that allowed the music to be soft and deeply felt and didn't fall over the edge into background music.  Land of the Sun doesn't quite pull that off.  It really is quite beautiful and I love Gonzalo Rubalcaba's piano work, but the edge just isn't there this time out.  If you don't have Nocturne let me guide you in that direction.
B0000027I6|3.0|I'm a huge Pink Floyd fan and just recently started collecting solo works by Pink Floyd. I heard that this was suppose to be Roger Waters best solo album so I decided to buy it. WOW!! What has happened to Roger Waters voice, its totally dead! When he sings it almost sounds painful at times. The lyrics are exceptional like all Waters albums but his voice has really aged. I recommend \\"The Pros and Cons of Hitchhiking\\" or \\"Radio C.H.A.O.S.\\", his voice sounds much better in those. Buy this album if ur trying to complete ur Pink Floyd collection.
B00006J9OT|5.0|I steadfastly refused to jump on the Diana Krall bandwagon.  I tried and enjoyed a number of the other wave of female jazz/pop singers.  I really liked a lot of that stuff.  And I thought I was avoiding a middle-of-the-road crowd favorite without much to offer.  As is so often the case I WAS WRONG AND I AM SORRY.  Live In Paris is magnificent.  That voice, that confidence, that attitude - it's all good.  The only thing potentially better would be to actually be in Paris at a Diana Krall concert.  Enjoy!
B00005JKED|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theater when it first came out. I didn't know really what to expect. But to this day I can still enjoy this movie like I was watching for the first time. Most women I know for some reason don't like this movie. Maybe because their dear Denzel shows his true talent in being an excellent heel in this movie. It's not your regular Denzel, well I guess it was the beginning of a change with movies like Out of Time and Man on Fire he was grimey in all of those movies. But it's a great movie one movie the fellas can enjoy any time of the day. Screw what the hateful ladies are bit%hing about kick back and enjoy and tell them by time your done cooking dinner the movie will be over.
B00061QK02|1.0|This movie is a bore. It makes the stupid humor of the Naked Gun movies seem side splitting in comparison.    If your idea of funny is staring at a guy with a fake moustache dressed in 1970's clothes, this might be the movie for you.    If you appreciate anything more than a kindergarten level of humor pass on this one.
0375508414|5.0|This is a book that has been sitting on my shelf for years and I finally pulled it down and read it because a friend told me it was one of her favorite books. I am sorry I waited so long but very glad I finally read it.  <br /> <br />This book is a delight!  It is fun and it is also in a wry way a window to the foibles, loves, kindnesses and evils of a time past. And a parable about the tenacity of the human spirit. <br /> <br />It is the story of two women who meet in the 80's. Mrs Threadgoode, in her 80's telling the story of her life and the Whistle Stop Caf to Evelyn who is depressed, unhappy and eating her way through a sad middle age. Mrs Threadgoode's life and the characters that people it are fascinating and the story is filled with humor, drama and heartache. <br /> <br />Through the ministry of the stories of the Whistle Stop Caf, Evelyn is rejuvenated and inspired to face the challenges of her life while her company and attention adds pleasure to the waning years of Mrs Threadgoode. <br /> <br />Fun, fun, a wonderful read! <br />
B0002KVUKM|3.0|This movie is what it is. My favorite charactors were Dracula's Brides.<br /><br />I know CGI is here to stay, but good Lord could we tone it down just a bit? I miss the good old days with stop motion action and people in costumes. The CGI looks just as fake as Stop Motion Puppets, but with CGI you feel like you're watching a video game instead of a film.<br /><br />Some people will like this, some won't. It's one of those movies you really have to see for yourself because everyone has an opinion on it.

B00005JMXX|2.0|This was a multi-million dollar movie that boiled down to a bad joke about Mexico closing it's borders to the United States. Ha ha ha.
6300270432|4.0|For a movie made in the 70s, this Pollack production deserves a hats-off for being so way ahead of its time. From a Kendo class with very accurate \\"kata\\" to Ginza's neon lights, the film gets it astonishingly spot on, which is remarkable given the preoccupation of the rest of the world with the meteoric rise of that whole Japan chimera at the time.<br /><br />The script is a tough, well-constructed tale of a tired man returning one last time to the past, back to the biggest regret of his life, ultimately gaining a deeper understanding of what really happened and atoning for his sins. Part love story, part intense drama, part ode to all things Japan.<br /><br />The acting is pretty decent all round. Ken Takakura was on his baby steps into Hollywood but still at the top of his game. Mitchum was reliably strong and despite being past middle age at this time he took the younger actors for a lick in his scenes. Keiko Kishi as the aged love interest was insufferable in her TV-drama style piffling and convulsing, but let's not go there, she did well to mumble through borderline comprehensible dialogue.<br /><br />No, it's something else that makes the film somewhat tedious to sit through. Perhaps the rendition of the script on to the screen was way too sluggish for modern tastes, even for kindred souls like me who don't mind Kurosawa's epics. Or perhaps it was the multitude of mighty themes -- honor, loyalty, burden, duty, friendship, love, loss, obligation, and the differences between the men of pre and post war Japan -- all smooshed into one steaming mishmash. Or maybe I simply missed having the DVD quality that I'm spoilt with, the movie is only available on VHS or a letterboxed LD.<br /><br />Whatever its failings, its widescreen compositions merit mention, they're stupendous, especially some moments like a battle in the denouement. Recommended rental for sure, in particular if you wish to get a glimpse of Tokyo. Just be prepared for some melodrama.
B00006690G|4.0|Even though all of his CDs have the same main focal point, critizing his moms and his girl (or ex), while showing affection to his daughter, em does it flawlessly.  He is without a doubt the best rapper in the game in my opinion, sorry Jay-Z fans (\\"eminem murdered you on your own sh**....\\" a quote from the greatest LYRICIST to hold down a mic).  He delivers his material with anger and fire (White America), then he will mellow it out (Superman).  All around this is a great album (not a classic), if you are an eminem fan then you already have it, if you tryin to figure out why this guy has so much hatred towards a select group of people, pick it up and listen to him, i'm sure you will understand where he comin from.
B00004RF9B|5.0|This is one of those wonderful works of science fiction:  it both stretches the imagination and reflects the time in which it was made.  The plot revolves around a rescue mission, to a colony that has been silent for 20 years.  Upon arrival, the crew discover a series of mysteries:  while nearly the entire original crew was mysteriously murdered, a single man (Morbius) was miraculously immune, as was his daughter.  The survivors are served by a fantastic robot, Robby, one the original scifi creations that I remember as a child, who is far beyond the science of man to create.  Then there is the hidden menace, which slowly reveals itself as a being that seems to defy the laws of physics.<br /><br />Morbius, of course, is the key to these mysteries, but he is stubborn and convinced of his moral rectitiude as he chooses himself as the guardian of an ancient extraterrestrial culture.  A fateful battle of wills follows with the captain, for whom Morbius' daughter has fallen.  The solution to all the mysteries come together in a wonderfully unforeseen conclusion, which surprises as well as reflects the then-popular Freudian psychanalysis of the time.  It is simply brilliant, both in its themes and its technical execution.  This story will live in my imagination for my entire life.  It is still worth seeing.<br /><br />Warmest recommendation.
B0000029GA|5.0|If you are not feelin this album its either because of two things, you probably have not copped it or you believe the greatest album from the greatest lyricist is somethin called reasonable doubt.  the first problem can be cured, it only cost $15, the other requires some serious help.
B0000542DH|1.0|I'm so glad I - or rather my Dad - got this DVD so cheap, otherwise I would have mighty disappointed. I wasn't particularly that fussed about watching it - I mentioned it, because one of the Tru Calling episodes was similar in a way. (I can't see HOW, my Dad pointed that out) And then my Dad ended up picking it up dirt cheap for me.<br /><br />I lasted 46 minutes, before finally giving up.<br /><br />I've seen worse films than this (Halloween, Last Broadcast, Lost Highway *cough*), and managed to last through them, but this film was bad. Worse than bad. Even worse than Lost Highway, and that's saying something! I lasted through that!!! I couldn't understand it, and it was severely disjointed, and made no sense to me whatever. I didn't like either Juliette or Woody Harrelson in this.<br /><br />I don't know what I was expecting from this, but certainly not what I got. Is it even worth wasting my words on? Well, here's my review ... !
1400034779|4.0|Like all of Alexander McCall Smith's books in this series, \\"The No.1 Ladies' Detective Agency\\" captures the \\"feel\\" of life in Africa.  So much of the printed material that Westerners come in contact with about countries in Africa has a negative or impersonal focus.  The \\"No. 1 Ladie's Detective Agency\\" series gets beneath the politics and the news stories about \\"incidents\\" and poverty and disease to give a sense of the beguiling rhythm and charm and fullness of the daily lives of the ordinary people who make up much of Africa's population.  McCall Smith captures all of that through stories that are fun to read and memorable in simple ways.  His characters are universally recognizeable and at the same time, quintessentially African.  He's a great storyteller. <br /> <br />Sherry Norman Sybesma <br />Author of \\"Two Weeks in a Land Rover, On Safari in Tanzania\\"
B00030EIXW|4.0|The polar opposite to a late Celibidache interpretation, but hugely potent nonetheless. A truly great maestro at work here. <br /> <br />
B00005JN0A|5.0|I just bought Eurotrip with another DVD in order to get discount. However, this is a super surprising movie!!! It keeps me laughing from the beginning to the end although I don't know these actors in the movie. You'd better watch this because it's even better than American Pie or others.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|If you are a heavy metal and DT fan this is the best DT album to date. It is heavy from start to end an long as usual and by the end of it you still want more. Anyone that gives this album less than 3.5 is not a metal fan and should have never become a DT fan in the first place.
B0001GF2DS|4.0|Well the only thing that prevented me from giving this 5 stars is the sound tracking....that the actors and some of the voices are so out of sync its horrendous.  They could have done better....it was 1967 and they could have at least overlayed the sound properly. <br /> <br /> <br />     That gripe aside,  this is one of the all time great classic Westerns.  They really put in the time and Hollywood cashola on this one because the storyline,  backdrops, cinematography,  and music are all tremendous.  The music I think deserves special mention....it is one of the most breathtaking scores I have ever heard and Im sure that the folks who worked on the Star Wars movies took a few cues from this score.  Its awesome. <br /> <br /> <br />     So if youre a fan of westerns and/or great movies,  go pick this up right away because its terrific!!!
077106506X|4.0|When recommending a book to someone, I try to keep in mind what theyre interested in.  The joy of Munros books is that you dont have to do thistheyre really about any and everything and the writing is so accessible and intelligent that anyone can pick these up and like them.  If you enjoyed Jackson McCraes THE CHILDRENS CORNER or David Eggers HOW WE ARE HUNGRY, then youll love Munros latest collection.  Of all the stories in this staggering little bunch, Powers was, for me, the most riveting.  Dealing with a young woman who has the ability to read the future, her escapades start the ball rolling (not always in a good direction) for family and friends.  Munro is a Canadian, and one might suspect she would be somewhat limited in her material.  Not so.  These stories are filled with insight that cuts across geography and time.  If you enjoy good writing that takes its time to work its charm on you, then I strongly suggest you try RUNAWAY.  If you havent read the Eggers or the McCrae yet, those are musts.  With the short story form coming back into vogue, these are all winners.
6302902010|4.0|The original 1950's Porgy and Bess was the very first musical I ever saw, and it was fantastic.  I have now tried without success to get a copy of this original film.  I have the Glyndebourne DVD, but it is not in my opinion as good as the original.  I really would like to find out if there are any copies of the 1950's film available, can you help? please.
0385512104|4.0|There are several dozen excellent reviews here, so I'll try to be brief.  This is a VERY different read.  The author has written the main character as an autistic boy and, through the mind of this boy, can expound on things that might otherwise be considered controversial or at least unconvetional.  This was very refreshing.  The author draws you in with what appears to be a straightfarward, even predictable, plot.  It's also a little amusing that the main character describes things like \\"red herring\\" just as the author is about to throw you one.  But the last quarter of the book simply doesn't bring closure and what it does bring is a little disturbing and unsatisfying.  Either the author is already planning a sequel, or he had a very hard time thinking up the ending.
B0002DKCMG|1.0|I swore I would never do this on Amazon, but I'm afraid I have to start with a self-describing caveat: I appreciate just about any movie for what it's worth. Honestly, I really do. I didn't mind \\"Titanic,\\" \\"Independence Day\\" has a leg to stand on, \\"Dude, Where's My Car\\" has some great moments, etc., etc. <br /> <br />\\"Eurotrip\\" is very possibly the worst movie ever made. There is not one redeeming thing about it. Not one. And I looked! I did, I tried to find something, anything. Nada. I've had more hilarious, exciting and un-rated trips to the taxidermist.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|I had seen the theatrical release and found it enjoyable but forgettable. I even rented the DVD of that version later just to be sure. Then I started reading the reviews of the Director's Cut so I took a chance and bought a copy. Now here is something juicy and memorable. I think the DC version really does justice to the Daredevil stories of Frank Miller from the early 80s - the whole Electra-Bullseye-Kingpin arc, as well as some of the elements added much later such as Matt's mother being a nun. It was really a joy to see those stories brought to life and done right. Also, while this version is darker it was also funnier as well due to the added scened with Foggy Nelson. This version really allowed you to see more of and therefore care more about the different characters.  <br /> <br />
B00005JN0T|4.0|While my taste runs to a more sophisticated type of film, there is no doubt that sometimes you just want to enjoy an old musical, adventure movie or spy thriller. This film surprised me because it's so doggone fun, yet brilliant in the quality of it's execution. <br /> <br />I admit that it took me a while to see this film because I did not care for the type of character that Will Smith has been known to portray... the half-smile \\"doesn't take anything seriously\\" wise-cracking type of buffoon. But since he has matured in body and attitude, he has developed into a different sort and I thought he was perfect for this role. Yes, his language is sprinkled with profanity and ghetto language, but it was just the gritty sort of \\"real life\\" manner this otherwise sterile vision needed. Without it, the film might have been antiseptic and unbelievable in scope. <br /> <br />After a few minutes of apprehension, I sat back and completely enjoyed this film. It's a romp, a lark, an adventure, and masterfully executed. If a person thinks this plot is predictable, and therefore unenjoyable, then I say \\"what about 'Singing in the Rain', '42nd Street', \\"Stagecoach' and a myriad of other films from our history that we consider to be classics?\\" In other words, not every film has to be \\"Citizen Kane\\" or \\"Gandhi\\" to be enjoyable, interesting and entertaining. Good heavens, even doctors, university professors and the heads of government can enjoy the rides at Disneyland! Give me a break. <br /> <br />Will Smith has made some terrilbly weak films in the past... \\"Independence Day\\", \\"Wild Wild West\\" and \\"Made in America\\"... the type of roles which had his goofy grin saying \\"look at me, I'm so funny\\"... and his name in the credits for me was a warning that said \\"stay away\\"... but a good friend urged me to see this film, and I am glad I did. In it, he is superb, tender, strong and likable. The special effects are amazing, innovative and convincing, the robot art direction by Oana Bogdan is magnificent, and last but not least, the performance by Bridget Moynahan is marvelous and authentic. <br /> <br />By the way, if you loved Issac Asimov's book, you might not be totally pleased, since most science fiction films taken from books, including this one, vary from the original. But not to worry, this film rocks. I highly recommend it as an engaging and thrilling ride.
B000092ZYX|2.0|After a string of masterpieces (The Bends, Ok Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac), and a good first album (Pablo Honey), they came out with a dissapointing album.  Is it envitable that every band has a poor album every now and then? I'm not so sure, but this one definitely qualifies.  I bought this album expecting maybe too much which possibly has led to my opinion that this album is bad.  I popped the album into the CD player of my car and began to listen to what was one of the most dissapointing moments in my life, music wise.  The first song, \\"2+2=5\\", was not a good beginning.  I continued to listen, after about three songs, I started to question the quality of the album. I listened to the entire album that moment in the car. I realized that there was not one good song, only bad and sub-par ones, on the entire album.  Even \\"There There\\", their single just seemed like it was lacking something.  The brilliance and uniqueness just wasn't there, like I felt in their previous albums.  I gave the album several more chances, but enough was enough. I came to terms and realized that Radiohead actually released a sub-par album. I put it on my shelf, and I don't plan on picking it up in the near future.  Although the album isn't horrible, like it may seem in my description, it definitely isn't good.  This is by far Radiohead's worst album (their only bad one).  If you are interested in learning some Radiohead, don't start with this album.  Actually, don't ever get this album and stick with the first 5.   <br />Album rating: 2/5
0800177177|4.0|This film is a brilliant one. It is sophisticated, engaging, and scary as hell. The special effects were done strictly on camera, I am told, and there are no cutting-edge CGI here... it's all careful editing and camerawork, which is amazing. <br /> <br />The way the story is told will be difficult for some, but it is filmed as though it were a book, although not particularly Bram Stokers book. Not to worry. <br /> <br />Gary Oldmans Dracula, though different from Lugosi and Langella, is frightening. He really pulls out the stops and displays some truly horrific mannerisms... and he makes this character his own.  <br /> <br />Unfortuanately, the performance by Ryder seems stiff, pretentious and her accent is an absolute mockery, but the rest of the cast and the visuals are so strong, she can't bring the film down by much. Though young for the part, Keanu Reeves does a good job as Harker, and his accent is more credible. Anthony Hopkins and Sadie Frost, however are nothing short of brilliant and their characters are real standouts. <br /> <br />Lastly, hair stylist and wig maker Stuart Artingstall stole the show with his miraculous hair creations for Gary Oldman. He should have won an Oscar for them. I first saw this film in 1991, and the image of those head dresses were the one thing I remember above everything. It helped make this film memorable in a visually way and I still can't take my eyes off of them. It helped to make Oldmans character so memorable and so totally unique to him. It is said they are inspired by the Japanese Kabuki Theater in Japan, and in some ways, that very style mirrors the continuity and narriative of the script. Brilliant.
B000002UAX|4.0|This is the best album the Beatles have ever made in my opinion. Yes, you may say, why did I gave it 4 stars? I will explain later in my review. <br /> <br />I won't say any fact about this album, because everyone knows them and nearly every reviewer has written the facts in their review. I'm only going to say what my opinion is. This album has my favourite Beatle songs ever, like Bungalow Bill, While My Guitar Gently Weeps (the best Harrison song), I Will, Birthday, Sexy Sadie, Helter Skelter and Cry Baby Cry. It also has a very special feel to it. Don't skip any song or you'll regret it in the end. Don't even skip Revolution 9, because it will set you in the mood for the grand finale. The final song, Good Night, will make you remember how good, inbalanced, and strange the album is, it will make you remember Back In The USSR, Glass Onion, Obladi, Wild Honey Pie, Blackbird, and other special gems in the album.  <br /> <br />And now, why did I give it just 4 stars if it's my favourite album of all time? Check this list: <br /> <br />BACK IN THE USSR                                                                 7.6 <br />DEAR PRUDENCE       6.2 <br />GLASS ONION       8.0 <br />OB-LA-DI, OB-LA-DA      8.3 <br />WILD HONEY PIE       8.5 <br />THE CONTINUING STORY OF BUNGALOW BILL  10.0 <br />WHILE MY GUITAR GENTLY WEEPS    10.0 <br />HAPPINESS IS A WARM GUN     9.0 <br />MARTHA MY DEAR      8.3 <br />I'M SO TIRED       8.0 <br />BLACKBIRD        7.5 <br />PIGGIES        7.3 <br />ROCKY RACOON       6.2 <br />DON'T PASS ME BY      7.0 <br />WHY DON'T WE DO IT ON THE ROAD    4.9 <br />I WILL        10.0 <br />JULIA         4.8 <br />BIRTHDAY        10.0 <br />YER BLUES        5.1 <br />MOTHER NATURE'S SON      8.5 <br />EVERYBODY'S GOT SOMETHING TO HIDE   7.7 <br />SEXY SADIE        10.0 <br />HELTER SKELTER       10.0 <br />LONG, LONG, LONG      9.0 <br />REVOLUTION 1       4.9  <br />HONEY PIE        6.3 <br />SAVOY TRUFFLE       7.0 <br />CRY BABY CRY       10.0 <br/>REVOLUTION 9       0.2 <br />GOOD NIGHT       6.1 <br />AVERAGE         7.5 <br /> <br />I made it in Word a few minutes ago, and it gives my rating for each song, and the average rounded gives an 8, therefore, a 4/5. There are some filler songs (Julia, both Revolution songs, Do It On THe Road), and some excellent ones, and you will remember all of them after listening to the album. Most satysfying music experience of all time.
B00005JNEI|5.0|The only people who give this documentary a 1 star are the damn patriotic americans who cant understand that their country is a messed up country with more faults than a George.W.Bush speech. They say that the whole thing is a lie but...there is proof for every fact that is given in the documentary. Also, the im just guessing that if the whole documentary had been done exactly the same but about another country, everyone that gave it 1 stars would have given 5.
0385510454|2.0|First half plain boring and worse. Second half decent with disappointing ending. Been a loyal Grisham fan up to now, but this is ridiculous. Contract filler, Grisham obviously bored to death writing this and could not care less about his readers. The only positive: he loves Italy and good ol' Europe.
0553212737|5.0|Ms. Austen wrote very well about headstrong, intelligent young women.  All of her books are wonderfully warm, but they show a tendency to light irony as well.  Ms. Austen describes her world of early nineteenth century England so very well.  In this book her heroine is Emma Woodhouse.  She is the younger daughter of a wealthy landowner.  She has a good heart, but she is spoiled.  She also sticks her nose into other people's love affairs with some disastrous results.  Miss Austen does a wonderful job describing life in a busy English village.  The village in this story is Highbury.  The characters in the book are wonderful, but it is the spiritual development of Emma that carries this book.  Somehow she manages to grow and learn while staying within the strictures placed on her by her father and by English village life.  Your journey reading Jane Austen's work is not complete if you do not read this book.
0452284392|3.0|Linked focuses on network theory and some of its applications, where networks are defined as dynamic linear graphs.  It is written for the non-mathematicians, and in fact does a very good job of giving the reader insight into how the mathematical modeler thinks and works, and what mathematical modeling is (the phrase \\"dynamic linear graphs\\" does not actually appear in the text).  \\"Linked\\" is kind of an intellectual memoir, and especially in the first few chapters, is charming as well as informative.  The problem is that Barabasi has an inflated view of the importance and primacy of his work and interests vis-a-vis the general subject of the theory of complex systems.  Also, while Barbasi strikes me as intellectually honest, his lack of knowledge of such subjects as cellular biology leads him to  erroneous claims for what insights may be attributed to recent work in network modeling. He is on stronger grounds when he discusses narrow subjects such as the links between corporate directors, and Barabasi does seem to know quite a bit about sociological modeling and the Internet.  In terms of intellectual stimulation and excitement, Linked does not begin to match up with Emergence: The Connected Lives of Ants, Brains, Cities, and Software by Steven Johnson,  and I guess I was expecting something more comparable to that book.
0684800713|5.0|Although this is Hemingway's first published novel, it was not the first that I'd read.  I had read some of his later works before I came to this one.  The novel has been misunderstood for a number of reasons, not the least of which is that many people do not get the irony that is behind the story.  When it was published in 1926 it became the rallying cry for what people of that era called \\"the lost generation\\".  The book is about American expatriates living in France and Spain during the late 1920's.  Hemingway and some of his crowd actually did this, but in spite of that, Hemingway has stated that he didn't believe in the \\"lost generation\\" stuff.  He is more a proponent of man being the architect of his own life, but sometimes things get in the way.  I enjoyed the book because of Hemingway's wonderful characters, and because of his descriptions of things that he actually saw and did.  The section that describes the running of the bulls in Pamplona is great.  Although this book is a little lesser known than some of Hemingway's novels, it's worth a read.  Especially if you love Hemingway like I do.
B000002UW1|5.0|Just a minor correction to the review submitted by David Zasloff -- the song Strange, although it may have been recorded by Pylon, was actually a cover of a song by WIRE, a post-punk late 70's / early 80's british band.   :-) <br /> <br />By the way, REM's Document is a great album.   \\"King of Birds\\" is a beautifully done, often underrated song. <br /> <br />Standing on the shoulders of giants...
1400032717|5.0|I'll say it right off the bat; The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time is a wonderful and touching book, the kind of book that has become a rarity these days. Sometimes, you find that one truly amazing book that you know you'll want to read time and time again, that you want to tell all your friends about, that just won't leave your mind. The Curious Incident is such a book. <br /> <br />The story is narrated and told from the point of view of Christopher John Francis Boone, a fifteen year old autistic boy. What seems like a given to us is often a challenge for Christopher. He can't stomach the colours yellow and brown, he has a pet for a rat and he doesn't understand jokes or emotions very well. If there is one thing he's good at, it's mathematics. <br /> <br />Christopher decides to become an investigator when he finds the murdered body of Wellington, his neighbour's dog. Having read some Sherlock Holmes stories, Christopher knows what it takes to become a good detective. And, although he always tells the truth, he will go against his father's wishes and investigate to find the dog's murderer.  <br /> <br />But his investigation turns sour when Christopher ends up discovering secrets concerning his own life and his deceased mother. Christopher has no choice but to go on a journey that will change his life forever. <br /> <br />This book is simply magical. Having worked with autistic children, I can truly say that Haddon really go into Christopher's mind, writing down everything a boy with such a condition would think or feel. Fear is a common thing for Christopher. Touching him often triggers a violent reaction in him. And he is unable to finish his plate if different foods are touching each other. Haddon was really able to go into the mind of an autistic child. <br /> <br />I can't wait to read this one again, and to give it to as many people as I can. It's a rare thing to find such a magically, well-written and completely entertaining novel. Dare to goon this journey, you won't forget it.
B000286S8S|3.0|Instead of so many Hagar love songs,newer live versions of early songs or any from Cherone,this compilation should have included at least 12-14  more early Roth songs.These songs have more guts and variety than any since Roth left.\\"I'M THE ONE\\"-from VH,\\"OUTTA LOVE AGAIN\\",\\"SPANISH FLY\\", and \\"WOMEN IN LOVE\\"-from VH 2,\\"TAKE YOUR WHISKY HOME\\"-from WOMEN AND CHILDREN FIRST,\\"MEAN STREET\\",\\"PUSH COMES TO SHOVE\\" and \\"DIRTY MOVIES\\"-from FAIR WARNING,\\"LITTLE GUITARS\\",\\"THE FULL BUG\\" and \\"SECRETS\\"-from DIVER DOWN,\\"TOP JIMMY\\",\\"DROP DEAD LEGS\\", and \\"HOUSE OF PAIN\\" from 1984.The second half of disc two and one or two of the weaker roth songs,like the cover of (oh)Pretty Woman should have been dropped in favor of these 14 aformentioned songs.
6300214028|4.0|I saw Reds when it was first released, and remembered liking it very much.  Since then I have spent many years becoming better acquainted with the backdrop against which it is set, having read and studied early 20th century American intellectual life, and familiarized myself with its art, literature and politics.  Last night, after 24 years, I watched Reds again and feel compelled to articulate my opinion.  This is not only a beautiful, moving piece of work, but a well-informed and highly important historical artifact as well.  Warren Beatty is best known as a dashing, handsome actor - he is less known as a scholarly and visionary writer and director; and while Beatty gives a great performance, Reds is truly a testament to the latter.  I challenge anyone with knowledge of the period to dispute the authenticity and attention to detail of the portrayal of WWI-era bohemian Greenwich Village and the issues that preoccupied it.  And from a purely aesthetic perspective, every beautifully balanced scene is a work of art.  One comes away with the impression of having viewed a series of dimly lit paintings from another unimaginably distant era, portraits of the timeless world of young adulthood, that period of heady intensity and newfound freedom when one is certain that all endeavors are possible and that idealism, romance and friendship are the passport to glory.
B00008PX8P|5.0|No Led Zeppelin fan could ever ask for anything better.  This DVD is sometimes draw dropping and will make you look twice at the person next to you. The camera angles, the sound, the wonderful music, and the fact that it is all packed into TWO discs is awesome. The choice of songs is great and won't leave you disappointed. Also, Jimmy Page using a violin bow on his guitar during the song 'Dazed and Confused' is one of the greatest things I've watched a musician perform.   <br /> <br />At times you wish you could be at those concerts and feel the greatness of Zeppelin. <br /> <br />Please, if you are a hardcore Zeppelin fan, you owe this to yourself.
B0002KVUKM|4.0|This movie barely sits still for more than a couple of minutes when it's another attack, another fight, another monster. That alone kept me from getting bored. Not the greatest plot, but monsters like these are still fairy tales.  And yes, even in the midst of all the action I kept thinking to myself, \\"How much did all the special effects cost?\\"<br /><br />Good movie for munching popcorn and having the time go by quick. Worthy of a sequel if they tone down the special effects and make more of a story.  Think more like \\"LoTR\\". Good movie? I think so.  A classic? ... Neh.
6301955609|5.0|What's artful about this film is that it keeps you on the edge of your seat during the entire dramatic and surreal epic and makes you go through a transformation by feeling fear, disgust, sadness, and confusion. There are many stories going on at the same time of love, jealousy, insanity, religion, and so on. The link between the characters is never clear, but Jodorowsky keeps you enthralled with stunning colors and odd circus people crawling about.    Concha is the hot-tempered (and slightly insane) Mexican who is part of some bloody cult, and married to the fat gringo. He cheats on her and when she catches him in the act, she pours what looks to be some kind of acid on his genitals, and he goes off and cuts her arms off and slices his throat in front of their young boy Fenix. Obviously after that, Fenix becomes disturbed and goes into an insane asylum. If you notice carefully, after the gringo kills himself and the ambulance comes, Concha is also pulled out on a stretcher with her face covered that perhaps indicates that she may have died.     Therefore, everything that happens after Fenix escapes the insane asylum could be delusional, because if you also notice, the mother and the young trapeze girl don't age  That was just an example of how this film could be interpreted, but I'm just one person. Many people could have other ideas, but that's what makes this piece so brilliant. It keeps you hanging and haunted. I don't want to give away the whole story if that's even possible, but at the end, I'm inclined to believe that Fenix did what he did to resolve his issues with his mother. You must see it! No subtitles.     Jodorowsky, who created this peculiar colorful masterpiece film, should be given credit for being original and not labeled and compared to Fellini, Bunuel, or Argento (who are also great). He is simply a foreign director doing his art his way, not conforming to Hollywood because in other countries art is not as commercialized as it is in the U.S. There doesn't always have to be a successful conclusion, a clichd love scene, and a predictable plot.
0141301155|5.0|this book is great. ive never gotten higher. i mean, except for all the drugs i was on when i read the book. this is the best extended drug reference that i have ever read. if u ask me, willy wonka was dropping acid everytime no one else was looking.  <br />-sincerely, a guy who is on shrooms at 1 am on a sunday and just watched the movie. <br /> <br />oh and i am a 14th grade student <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show make's all the Star Trek's, Stargates, Babylons and the like(most of which I'm also a fan)seem like dinner theater. The look and feel is like you would expect if 500 years had passed and things like dirt and wind and animals still existed. Not some sterile hospital-like, ceilingless spaceship sets or foam rocks on a soundstage with the standard \\"purple alien sunset\\" backdrop. <br /> <br />To the morons at Fox. First you allow yourselves to be a totally partisan, therefore unreliable, GOP propaganda spewing machine and then you let one(actually several)of the most finely conceptualized and intelligently written television series, slip through your fingers. Oops. GOP and intelligent in the same sentence. <br /> <br />Kudo's to Universal for the upcoming feature film(and thanks for UHD). Now to start those Sci-Fi channel(or better yet, UHD?)reruns to usher in the movie this Sept. Get the DVD set just in case. I'm not sure Universal owns the rights to the original series. I believe Fox distributed the DVD.
B00009Z576|5.0|Okay maybe not better than such classics as Fragile, Closer, and Relayer but much better than previous crap like Tormato and Topographic Oceans. The old hippies or any fan from that era who dismiss this great album are simply clueless and guess what...Trevor Horn is a far superior vocalist and lyricist. Jon Anderson is highly overrated. I mean what's with walking on stage every night with robes and other assorted evening wear! Machine Messiah is a masterpiece and as good as anything Yes has ever done.
B00005JN0T|3.0|A lot of action in this one.  A very simplistic science fiction plot, but I guess good for middle schoolers, who may find it easier to suspend reason.   Will Smith is a good actor, no doubt, but the plot was a little far fetched for me, the evil machine against the good heart of man.   This will be very popular with the U.S. masses.
0312263120|2.0|.. you might not be insulted by this one.    <br /> <br />I made it about 90% through this one, but have decided not to finish it.   The information he cites about the NSA and cryptography contain so many flaws as to be laughable.  It's *FULL* of *MAJOR* errors that any editor or reviewer with even moderate technical savvy should have flagged before it went to print. <br /> <br />And that's too bad, because the basic plotline would scarcely have suffered if he had been more correct in his description. <br /> <br />The basic thriller plotline isn't badly done, it's what kept me reading this far, but I stopped because of the idiocies mentioned above and the fact that the characters aren't \\"real\\" enough to keep me engaged more. <br /> <br />I *might* finish it later, but I just have too many books in my queue from authors that write \\"smarter\\" books.

B000001ESP|5.0|This, the most popular album by Rush is a perfect balance between the earlier long  rock epic hits (like 2112) and the shorter yet complex songs (like subdivision) with good production, tight performances and intelligent futuristic lyrics.    `Tom Sawyer' is a perfect opener with wonderful guitar work and sharp vocals. `YYZ' is a racy rocking instrumental with exceptional work by Lee on the bass, there are various moods with the guitar from fast lead to the softer blues and acoustic rhythm. Neil's drumming is exceptional as usual which is why he is one of the greatest drummers in the world.    `Red Barchetta' is an even paced complex track with typical Rush lyrics of an individual pitted against machine in some distant society (this time the reference point being a vehicle). `Limelight' is wonderfully mellow and an easy flowing  song where Lee sings about the experience of being famous. Alex Lifeson's wailing guitar work shines on this one.    `The Camera eye', `Witch hunt' and `Vital signs' are numbers that will be preferred more by the diehard fans then the casual listener. These songs are typical of Rush's less commercial work replete with synthesizers, sound effects and great guitar work.    `Moving Pictures' is a true classic that is timeless and will survive the test of time.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|People either love or loath this movie.  Personally, I loved it, but I can easily understand that it would not appeal to large numbers of people.  If you enjoy quirky, offbeat movies like, A Mighty Wind, Best in Show, Crumb or Hairspray, I would think it likely that you'd appreciate this one.  Of the fifteen people I have introduced to my new favorite movie, only one has not liked it; the other fourteen want to watch it again and again.  Take a chance.  If you don't like it, there is an excellent chance a friend would love to take it off your hands.
B00003CXA2|5.0|<br />The highly acclaimed director Robert Zemeckis, the genius behind the cult classic `Back To The Future', can add another feather to his cap with this summers box office smash Forrest Gump. This epic of human proportions, staring Tom Hanks as the smartest dumb person in America, will capture hearts world wide with its warming feel good story line.   <br />The chronicles of a young man who's accent comes straight form his back bone, following Forrest from his first day at school, to Vietnam and strangely shrimping. This film is the story of one mans accident through life. He may not have the highest IQ... or even an average on for that matter, but he still manages to become one of Americas most successful business tycoons. He meets many famous icons of our time, some by accident, some by luck by most by stupidity along his ride to the top, including J.F.K, Elvis, president Nixon and John Lennon.   <br />But who or what is Forrest Gump? Is he a simpleton? An idealist? A moral paragon? In this movie it's more appropriate to describe him as what he isn't. Forrest lives in a world that derides him as stupid but, as Mrs Gump says, \\"stupid is as stupid does\\", and in this movie it's everybody else who seems to cross that behavioural line, it's not Forrest that's `retarded', it's the rest of the world.  <br />But what's special about this film is that it goes against all conventional rules of film production, there are no heroes or quests to complete just the irrepressible spirit of Forrest Gump. He may not know much but he definitely knows how to treat people right. But having said this, what's a film with out a love interest? Provided by the fantastically talented Robin Wright, this impossible relationship only fuels the love story making a classic cinema romance. As kids Forrest and Jenny shared a common purity but as the couple grow, Jenny sheds her child hood innocence leaving Forrest behind. Jenny stumbles from one bad trip to another and while everybody else seems to engage in acts of relentless, well, stupidity, forest maintains his carefree attitude that is the life blood of this cinematic triumph. Trough all this Forrest is the constant: he sees the world in simple terms, intent on doing the right thing <br />     Forrest Gump addresses many of the crucial American wounds of the 20th century: Vietnam, relationships with African-Americans, drugs, capitalism and the mistreatment of women. Naturally Forrest himself takes the morally right line on all of these. However just beneath the surface Forrest Gump could be little more than an ideological fairy story to keep Americans believing in the cause. If only we could have a world where the best-intentioned half-wit could pop up at opportune moments in history, winning hearts, amassing a fortune and becoming famous. Sadly, the world generally belongs to those who have screwed over someone else to get there - and that isn't Forrest, he's too nice a guy.  <br />The acting is strong, the narrative is compelling and its semi-documentary style direction is consistent and provides clarity and pace. While Forrest may look to be only primary colours, Hanks gives him all the shades of the 64-crayon box; humour, rage, suspicion, doubt, longing, all swirl in his mesmerizing performance. Much of the film is about the country's pain over having its innocence ripped away in that era by war and civil strife and how, in Forrest Gump, the child lived on. But in no way is this film another tabloid version of history, what it depicts is done right with class and style <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />  <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006399FS|2.0|How To Dismantle an Atomic Bomb is a real bringdown for U2.  Their previous CD, All That You Can't Leave Behind was a career highlight.  Almost every song on that CD had a memorable melody.  On How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb, the melodies are few and far between.<br /><br />At the least the CD starts out strong with the high energy single Vertigo.  Origin of the Species, Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own, and One Step Closer are the best of the rest as on the fourth listen their melodies stand out somewhat.<br /><br />However, the other songs are pretty forgettable.  Yes, Bono sings them with some conviction and the Edge add some neat sepcial effects on his guitar.  However, many of the pieces are a little too restrained and coupled with the limited melodies on his hour long CD, I would recommend passing on this collection.<br /><br />Get All That You Can't Leave Behind and Achtung Baby instead.
B00003CXZ1|2.0|I have played all the games (including Angel of Darkness-yuck), and I am a big fan of Tomb Raider and hottie Angelina Jolie. So when I went to the theatre I was excited. But now... <br />First of all, this has nothing to do with any Tomb Raider storyline, and never should have anything to do with it. A clock and poor Laura's daddy? Who cares??? This is not the Laura that fans know! Although Angelina makes a good Laura, she would be way better if not based on a video game. The only good fighting scene is the mansion. The rest... <br />sucks. <br />I have this on VHS. I was gonna get in on DVD but... <br />Why Bother? <br />A good movie to... <br />Pass time. <br />Oh, and another good scene is... <br />Shower Scene. <br />When there is an unrated version released... <br />I'll buy it. <br />Until that day, though... <br />screw it.
B000002LQR|4.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers are one ecclectic hip cool band.  And this is comming from someone who grew up on classic rock from the 60's and 70's.  The steady bass and drumming coupled with the funky guitar licks and the varying singing/rapping vocals adds up to an excellent set.<br /><br />Many highlights abound ranging from the New Orleans driven Apache Rose Peacock to the politically liberal Power of the Equality to the softer tunes(Breaking The Girl, Under The Bridge, I Could Have Lied) to hard core tunes(The Greeting Song, Give It Away).  I even like the speedy one and a half minute Robert Johnson cover They're Red Hot.<br /><br />This release isn't as melody driven as their By The Way CD.  However, the funky stylings on this Blood Sugar Sex Magik release certainly can get your groove going.  And that is certainly a good thing.
0316172324|5.0|In Blink, Gladwell reveals how we can become superior decision makers, in our homes, our workplaces, and in daily life. Delving into revolutionary discoveries in neurology and psychology, he reveals how we craft decisions, and why some individuals are so profoundly better at it than most of us. His thesis, which he fully supports with facts, not speculation, is that distinction between good decision-making and bad has little to do with how much information we can process rapidly, but on the particular minutiae on which we focus. The \\"blink\\" in the title is comes from Gladwell's surprising conclusion that what we think of as decisions made in the blink of an eye are much more intricate than we usually presuppose. After reading this, you will never again \\"think about thinking\\" in the same old way. <br />
0385421982|3.0|This story of a girl on the run from a crazed industrialist is well done.  If it seems there are a lot of clichees, remember that this book was so well done that it actually started the whole genre of person on the run from shady corporate? government? people.  The protagonist is a law student who accidentally stumbles upon the solution to a crime (assassination of supreme court judges).  Someone is trying to silence her.  The entire story is her running, the people who are trying to help her, and the people who are trying to kill her.  Not bad.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|This a \\"clean\\" movie that anyone can watch with their kids.  True, Napolean is a nerd, but he is a funny one.   My family liked it so much that we are getting it for my 7 year old nephew's birthday.    The subtle humor is delightful.  My son has already watched it three times in the last week!
0385510454|3.0|Mr. Grisham has written a good weekend book about a man who is given an unexpected presidential pardon, is taken to Italy to hide, and must figure out why this is happening to him.  I never much care, on a personal level, for his characters.  They are always morally compromised, it seems to me.  But I do like how he writes about them.  I thought the chase was excellently drawn.  The only quibble?  I thought the character, Rudolph, was going to have a bigger role.  I was sorry that wasn't true.  I recommend this book to anyone who needs an absorbing quick read to kill a few hours.
B00006879E|3.0|Well I went out on a limb when I got this. I had only heard two of their songs on the radio and I liked them so I went ahead and bought it. I had only skimmed through the first 30 seconds of each song and decided it was a total waste of 15 dollars. After actually giving the CD a chance and listening to it the whole way through as background music while I did other stuff it started to catch on. I noticed some similarities to John Mayer, and I like John Mayer so I ended up liking this. The only thing I don't like about this CD is the background vocals are crap. At times they are just too stinking high in my opinion, they'd probably even make Claudio Sanchez of Coheed and Cambria cringe. But hey don't get me wrong, these guys aren't bad. <br /> <br />Oh and for the people calling Maroon 5 a boy band, don't you dare call these guys a boy band. They play their own instruments and they play them pretty well, they don't lip-synch, and they don't have to dance around on stage to try to keep people's attention. Sorry but that already disqualifies them. Straight from the dictionary: <br />boy band - a formulaically organized pop music group of good-looking young men who can sing and dance. <br /> <br />Formulaically organized? I don't believe that for a second. Could be though, I honestly don't know. Somebody can prove me wrong if they like and I'll trash my Maroon 5 CD. <br /> <br />Pop music group? Sure I guess. More like pop/funkish but I'll let it slide. <br /> <br />Good-looking young men? That's for the ladies to decide, but come on it's stupid to judge a band's intentions by their looks. <br /> <br />Can sing? Only the lead singer in my opinion. But hey if you're going to have a band, hopefully the singer(s) can sing, right? Unless you're either in an instrumental band or in an actual boy band, being able to sing is an essential. <br /> <br />Can dance? How am I supposed to know that? They're too busy playing their instruments.
B0002X314C|4.0|\\"Get Lifted,\\" the debut release from Kanye West protege John Legend, is certainly one of the finer soul releases of 2004, but let's not get carried away with the superlatives. Truth is, this record doesn't stray from the conventions of the genre we now know as \\"neo soul,\\" and it follows the neo-retro handbook a bit too closely. But that doesn't mean \\"Get Lifted\\" isn't worth checking out. With the assistance of Mr. West's production, Legend serves up an appealing dish of piano-flavored r&b that recalls the 1970s with the occasional dash of hip hop. Legend makes a convincing impression on \\"I Can Change\\" (with Snoop Dogg, in his umpteenth cameo), stands out memorably in the piano-only ballad \\"Ordinary People,\\" and gives us vocal range on the excellent \\"Let's Get Lifted Again.\\" What makes \\"Get Lifted\\" worth the trip is the raw emotion found in Legend's voice and the different moods and flavors that can be found throughout the album. At no point do you suspect that he's jumping on a bandwagon for easy cred, and that can't be said for a many r&b stars these days. Though John Legend hasn't quite yet lived up to his name, this solid debut shows that he's at least on the right path. Grade: B+.
B0002XVQNU|5.0|daredevil the director's cut is sensational! one of the best director's cuts i've ever seen and i'm a huge film buff. the extra kingpin scenes completely improve this character. the added murder mystery and court scenes add a whole new level of story. get the director's cut and you wont be sorry.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|I didn't know quite what to expect when I dropped this into the old DVD player. I hadn't heard a whole lot about it nor did I recognize anybody in it, but that's not surprising for an indie flick. I had heard somewhere that this movie, along with \\"The Incredibles\\" were the 2 best movies of the year. I had also read someone's review that likened it to a \\"teenage Wes Anderson\\" movie, to which I sure as heck hoped not, as I have tried twice to watch \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\" only to abandon the effort both times. So, ready for anything, I sat down to watch it.<br /><br />Well, I have to say I laughed pretty much throughout \\"Napoleon Dynamite\\". This movie is definitely not for everybody, but I didn't find it to be anything close to a Wes Anderson movie except for the dead-pan humor. I kept waiting to see what the main character Napoleon Dynamite, played superbly by Jon Heder, with his very odd delivery, would say next. Everything that came out of this ubernerd's mouth was pretty funny, actually. I even thought the supporting characters were pretty good. There's not a great deal of plot here, but in this movie, I don't think plot development was the main goal. If anything, it's a very well-done, if slightly bizzare, character study, and I was totally entertained the entire time.<br /><br />I loved this movie, but I wouldn't be surprised if you ended up totally hating it either. It just depends on what particular vein your sense of humor is geared towards. A lot of people are not going to like this movie. And that's fine if you don't. Some people like egg nog, some can't stand it. But a lot of people, like myself, are going to find this movie utterly hilarious. And ask for a second cup!
0064407667|4.0|lemony snicket is really a good story teller and i didn't mind it one bit that he kept saying his comments. also some reviewers found it annoying that he kept explaining some words. I found it very helpful though since English is not my first language. there were some words which he explained which were pretty obvious even to a 3 year old but i can skip that fact because it was a good book.
6304493681|5.0|Being the 399th review, what more can be said? The animation was really good but the voice over in english sucked- I recommend watching it in english with the subtitles on (of course, after watching it in japanese) to see what they're really supposed to be saying. It was also sooo much better than the book. if you didn't like the manga, you probably will like this. Not so much politics (and they explain those confusing future terms so you know what they're talking about). The music is the worst part. It's kind of scary. You can't even turn it down, risking missing something said. :(  Well, its great other than that.
0060922583|5.0|It's nice to have someone who keeps up on a number of disciplines, connects the dots between them and shares it with the rest of the world. That is what Michael Talbot has done with The Holographic Universe. Well referenced, Michael directs you to sources where you can check things out for yourself. For those who have not read this book I have only one thing to say: \\"It will change your life\\".
1891252089|5.0|I originally purchased this book a few months after first starting to practice yoga. I used it to development my personal asana practice. It is the definitive guide to the Ashtanga Primary and Secondary series. I took the Primary Series Teacher's Training with David Swensen and was surprised that he didn't give a copy of the book with the $895 price for the training. Much of what he said about the practice in the teacher's training is in the book.<br /><br />My wife and I teach Ashtanga yoga and use his book as a reference. I highly recommend the book for developing your home practice while taking classes with a trained instructor.
B00005JMYI|2.0|I wanted to like this movie.  Who better to play a smarmy anchorman than Will Ferrell, but sadly this movie was so badly scripted, dawdling over its many raunchy one-liners, like a 9-year proud of his first dirty joke.  Outside of cutting a striking figure in a white jumpsuit, Christina Applegate failed to create the sexual tension this movie badly needed to keep it afloat.  The jokes and gags may have looked good on paper but failed to materialize on the screen.  Even the big fight between rival news gangs failed to deliver, despite bringing out Hollywood heavy-hitters like Tim Robbins and Ben Stiller.  All in all, this movie was a sad disappointment.  Will Ferrell can do much better than this.
0393317552|2.0|Mr. Diamond is clearly someone who is of Western European descent but finds nothing, or very little, to admire in his own heritage. To hear him tell it -- endlessly, I might add -- Western Civilization owes it ascent and dominance purely through nature's circumstance. He discounts religion and culture as drivers in the development of nations. A ridiculous notion, indeed!  <br /> <br />For example, the Black Plague nearly wiped out Western Europe, but the Europeans rose from this period to begin the Renaissance era:  a period of unequalled creativity and increased liberties for the average citizen, leading to the end of serfdom. If Mr. Diamond were predicting the course of the 2-3 centuries following such a cataclysmic event, I have no doubt he would predict the area to fall into great decline.  <br /> <br />People determine their fate, and the fate of their nation, through their individual actions.
B0007DA6GI|5.0|This is, indeed, a magical, mystical movie about fathers and sons, which is based upon the book \\"Big Fish: A Novel of Mythic Proportions\\" by Daniel Wallace. The book is a perfect vehicle for Director Tim Burton's signature melange of reality and fantasy. The story is that of a father and his son, their estrangement, and their eventual reconciliation. It is a beautifully realized film that will bring tears to one's eyes.<br /><br />The father in question is Ed Bloom (Albert Finney) who loves to tell,  at least it seems so to his son, Will (Billy Crudup), tall tales about his past. The son becomes estranged from his father on his wedding day, when his father tells one tall tale too many for Will's tastes. For the next several years, Will communicates only with his mother, Sandra (Jessica Lange).<br /><br />When his father becomes seriously ill, however,  Will and his wife rush to his side. Father and son take final stock of each other, and the seemingly tall tales continue. As his father gets progressively worse, Will, feeling that he really does not know his father, embarks on a journey to discover for himself, once and for all, the man his father really is. What he discovers is that his father was not so off the mark with his stories, and he finally begins to appreciate who his father really is and the impact that he has had on others.  It allows Will to be able to say goodbye to his father in a way that his father understands and to be at peace with the man whom he discovered his father to be .<br /><br />The film takes the viewer on a ride through some of Ed Bloom's tall tales, in a series of vignettes,  where the viewer sees a young Ed Bloom (Ewan McGregor) living an almost fantastical life. We see him meet the love of his life, Sandra, as a young girl (Alison Lohman). We see him as a circus worker,  a soldier, a traveling salesman, and even a bank robber. We see some of the people that cross section his life: a giant, a diminutive ringmaster, a witch, singing Siamese twins, and a  bank robber. Ed even comes across a perfectly heavenly town full of wonderful, happy people.<br /><br />This is simply a marvelous film with fantastical elements reminiscent of \\"Forrest Gump\\" and \\"The Princess Bride\\".  Wonderful performances are given by veteran actors Albert Finney and Jessica Lange. Look for the very touching bath tub scene, where, fully clothed, the love between Ed and Sandra is palpable.  Albert Finney, in the role of the senior Ed Bloom, is exceptional as a raconteur of the first order. Ewan McGregor is remarkable as the charismatic, younger Ed Bloom, infusing the role with a joie de vivre that is as infectious as it is engaging.<br /><br />Jessica Lange is terrific as the senior Sandra Bloom, grounding her relationship with her husband with a steadfastedness born of years of mutual love and respect. Alison Lohman is simply lovely as the younger  Sandra, imbuing her character with a beautiful sense of innocence and longing. It is interesting that both Alison Lohman and Ewan McGregor strongly resemble their more senior co-stars.<br /><br />Billy Crudup is excellent as the angry Will Bloom, the son who needs to reconcile his image of his father with the man his father actually is.  Robert Guillaume is masterful in the small role of  the senior Dr.  Bennett. The rest of the stellar cast is superlative, though Danny DeVito's southern accent needed a bit more work.  The direction, however,  is deft, and the cinematography is brilliant.  This is an absolutely exceptional film. I really enjoyed it immensely, even though I initially viewed this film most reluctantly, and only after much persuasion by my son.  I am certainly glad that I did. This film has made me a fan of Tim Burton. It is filmmaking at its best. Bravo!amese twins, and a  bank robber. Ed even comes across a perfectly heavenly town full of wonderful, happy people.<br /><br />This is simply a marvelous film with fantastical elements reminiscent of \\"Forrest Gump\\" and \\"The Princess Bride\\".  Wonderful performances are given by veteran actors Albert Finney and Jessica Lange. Look for the very touching bath tub scene, where, fully clothed, the love between Ed and Sandra is palpable.  Albert Finney, in the role of the senior Ed Bloom, is exceptional as a raconteur of the first order. Ewan McGregor is remarkable as the charismatic, younger Ed Bloom, infusing the role with a joie de vivre that is as infectious as it is engaging.<br /><br />Jessica Lange is terrific as the senior Sandra Bloom, grounding her relationship with her husband with a steadfastedness born of years of mutual love and respect. Alison Lohman is simply lovely as the younger  Sandra, imbuing her character with a beautiful sense of innocence and longing. It is interesting that both Alison Lohman and Ewan McGregor strongly resemble their more senior co-stars.<br /><br />Billy Crudup is excellent as the angry Will Bloom, the son who needs to reconcile his image of his father with the man his father actually is.  Robert Guillaume is masterful in the small role of  the senior Dr.  Bennett. The rest of the stellar cast is superlative, though Danny DeVito's southern accent needed a bit more work.

B00009V7T2|5.0|For so many years the worlds of conceptual prog-rock and guitar-laden classic rock have clashed violently with the DIY nation of post-hardcore and punk. But the Mars Volta clearly didn't get that memo, for this masterpiece of an album (one of the new millenium's absolute finest) takes the very best elements from all these genre's and warps them into a hyperspace gumbo that open-minded music fans have been waiting years for. The Mars Volta destroy the foundation of all their influences, by taking away the overt drama and bombast of prog and replacing it with raw emotion, taking away the apathy and simplicity of power-chord punk, but retaining the enregy and drive, even nodding to speed-metal with their precise, high-octane tempo shifts. Outbursts of ear-shattering refrains and manic rundowns are nestled between ambient knob-teaking (brings recent radiohead to mind) and free-jazz inspired space-jams. The structure is unconventional, but every song is conneceted conceptually, although the \\"storyline\\", if there is one, cannot be indentified. I've been waiting years for an album this fresh and musical to appear. Highly recommended.
B00008G8M3|5.0|This is a sensational, sci-fi, alien invasion, action film with a terrific cast and superlative special effects. Alien invaders suddenly darken the skyline across the world, as city sized flying saucers hover ominously over major cities world wide. A computer geek, David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum), figures out how the alien ships are communicating with each other and realizes the import of what he has discovered. He manages to have an audience with President Whitmore (Bill Pullam), as his ex-wife is one of the president's top aides, and tells the president of his findings. Wonder at the alien saucer spectacle turns to terror, as the meaning of the ships in the sky becomes clear.<br /><br />The White House evacuates just in time, as the aliens launch a world wide attack in complete synchronization, an awesome spectacle that enthralls the viewer. A counter attack is launched, led by fighter pilot Captain Steve Hiller (Will Smith), which ends in disaster for the fighter pilots, as only Hiller survives to fight another day. He manages, however, to bring in a captive. Notwithstanding the gravity of the premise of the film, there are moments of comic relief interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Meanwhile, our computer geek, realizing why the counter attack failed, comes up with a solution, one that requires nerves of steel and a desire to walk on the wild side. A second counter attack is launched world wide, which leads to some terrific action scenes and heroics by a most unlikely candidate. Naturally, mankind is victorious. It is not the victory itself, however, but what leads up to the victory that makes the film so entertaining.<br /><br />This is a fast paced film with a myriad of subplots and coincidental pairings that may stretch the viewer's credence but do not take away from the enjoyment of the film. The special effects are dazzling. The cast is excellent. Will Smith is charming and funny throughout. Bill Pullam is appropriately presidential, and Jeff Goldblum is a most convincing computer geek. Look for fine performances from the stellar supporting cast: Mary McConnell, Robert Loggia, Margaret Colin, Randy Quaid, Judd Hirsch, James Rebhorn, Harry Connick, Jr., and Harvey Fierstein. All in all, this is a marvelous film.<br /><br />Be prepared for an unintended poignant moment in the film, when the camera pans to the New York skyline and the viewer sees the World Trade Center twin towers standing proud and tall on the horizon. It is a moment that gives the viewer pause in remembrance of what was. It is, indeed, a moment to remember.ost convincing computer geek.

B0006IIPIK|5.0|This movie was easily the best-looking, most exciting, most interesting, and most perfect film of the year in every way. All of the negative reviews made it clear that their writer simply did not understand the film. So that makes it a real shame that it only made $38 million at the domestic box office. Still, we should thank the studio for going through the trouble of adding some great extras, even though it was such a bomb. Do yourself a favor and buy this movie; it's well worth your time.
B00005JNEW|5.0|Great movie.  I never realized that highschool football is taken so seriously.  I cheered, yelled, applauded and even cried.  I HIGHLY recommend this movie.  Not to mention the kid from the movie Slingblade aged VERY VERY well.....  Dont miss this one.!! <br /> <br />
B000002U9W|5.0|This has to be the best album that Floyd ever recorded, and I don't get why anybody would rate it below 5 stars. <br /> <br />Atom Heart Mother - A great epic. Almost as good as Echoes. Would help if it wasn't completely instrumental, but it is still great. <br />If - Water's second best song, and has really great lyrics. <br />Summer '68 - The trumpet section expresses it all. Wright's greatest song. <br />Fat Old Sun - The best Floyd song ever recorded. David Gilmour has perfected guitar soloing and gives us the greatest solo of any song ever. <br />Alan's - Great mix of effects and music. Be cooler if it was afterr Summer '68 though and have the album end with the best rock out ever from Fat Old Sun, but still great the way it is. <br /> <br />I suggest that you buy this album after Dark Side of the Moon if you are new to Floyd (though this is the best, DSotM IS the way to start your Floyd fandom), and then get Meddle! You can thank me later...
B0002F6BRE|4.0|Playing the lead in the tale of Buddy, a human brought up by Santa's elves, Will Farrell gives a thoroughly engaging, non-ironic performance in this spritely and adorable Christmas movie. Farrell is convincingly sweet and innocent, which is a relief considering how many modern films seem incapable of presenting Christmas without its dark and hypocritical elements. Buddy unabashedly loves Santa and all things Christmas, discovers (through a series of slapstick height-based miscues) that he really isn't an elf. He determines to travel to New York City to meet his real Dad. Predictably, Dad (played with understatement by James Caan) is a businessman with a teeny, tiny heart of stone. Buddy can decorate a room with hand-made Christmas glitz in the blink of an eye. Guess who will change by the end of the film?<br /><br />The last third of the film droops like an underwatered Christmas poinsetta, as the plot requires Farrell to help Santa (Ed Asner) rejuice his sleigh, which has crash landed in Central Park. A few potential gags about the vaucuity of the media are left hanging, and the ending relies a bit too heavily on the movie clich&eacute; of cynical, seen-it-all New Yorker. Nevertheless, \\"Elf\\" was fun to watch, had un uplifting message about the Christmas spirit, and just might become a Christmas classics.
B000267JQK|5.0|I did not expect to like this album. I had the choice between this and \\"The Greyest of Blue Skies\\" by Finger Eleven. I decided I didn't have enough fast-paced albums, so I got Disclaimer II by Seether. It was not fast-paced, but its actually extremely great musically. The songs near the end tend to sound kind of similar, but they are actually an extremely talented band (I'm listening to the CD right now as I write this). There are a few songs I don't like (Gasoline and FXXX It), but they are all extremely catchy. I have spent many hours of my life with a seether song stuck in my head. I also love the instruments. But I do agree with some other reviewers that the lyrics could be better. The lyrics are almost all about girl troubles, kind of like Puddle of Mudd. I like it though. His voice could be a little higher, though. It's a little too low. Broken is my favorite song, though, I don't care if I'm unoriginal. It is so beautiful, even if it's repetative and simple. The artwork in the CD cover is also great. A little bizarre, but its very attractive.
0783225903|5.0|One of the most imaginative movies ever made, Brazil is the tale of a dreamer living in a dystopic future whose citizens have traded their liberty for security, and not much of that either. Only Terry Gilliam could have delivered the visual thrills that such a movie provides. The future is a mad conglomeration of high technology (telephones, auto, computers, TVs) and ancient tech (ductwork, magnifying lenses and complicated cables). Nothing works well, but no one particularly notices. Terrorists are hunted down with brutal police methods, but the public is mollified since suspects must pay for the cost of their own interrogation and torture. The rich and elderly are consumed with having their bodies remolded into better and better semblances of youth, suffering endless infections with giddy optimism. Shapeless, tasteless food is served with photographs of the dishes they represent.<br /><br />Into this complacent hell of a Paradise, comes Sam Lowery, a disconnected bureaucrat whose success comes from having that indispensible (and dangerous) asset -- common sense. Sam is hurled out of his reveries when the system makes a mistake -- something it cannot tolerate. In attempting to rectify the mistake, Sam is confronted by the victims of his bureaucracy and is caught in the gears of his smooth-running system. The ending is happy and distressing, as both Lowery and the system are \\"victorious\\" against each other.<br /><br />The movie seems longer than the version I saw in theaters in the 1980s. It became a tiny bit tedious toward the end, with repetitive chases and escapes, but the conclusion was right on. Lowery and the system both wound up winners, in their own, unproductive ways. Politically, \\"Brazil\\" is even more relevant now than in 1985. The degree to which people can become accustomed to intrusive government action (especially if they are not personally affected) and to confusing and inconvenient technology is presented marvelously. \\"Brazil\\" is a work of visual and political genius.s.
B0006H328E|5.0|This disc collects the three-part \\"City at War\\" story arc, as well as the \\"Rogue in the House\\" 2-parter. Note that with this release, the first two seasons of TMNT are now available on DVD.<br /><br />City at War, while fairly entertaining, is an example of the poor story pacing that plagued the series in its second season. The story was adapted from a 13-issue miniseries from the original comic, and while many subplots needed to be dropped or toned down for saturday morning standards, that's not the problem here. The problem is that plot points like the robot battle go on for far too long, cutting into time needed to develop Karai's arrival and her association with the Foot. You dont see enough of the gang violence to really get a sense that the entire city is at war. And Leo and Raph's arguments are annoying and circular - they argue because the writers make them argue, not because their arguing actually goes anywhere. And 4Kids TV standards are painfully clear, as no one gets remotely injured even when people are firing rocket launchers at each other from only 10 feet away.<br /><br />However, Rogue in the House makes up for all the problems with City at War, and is my main reason for recommending this disc. Featuring the fan favourite Triceraton Zog, this 2-parter is a clever homage to the original series that old school fans will love. Low on plot and high on quick action and references, we get Foot Mechs (the equivalent of the old Foot Soldiers), a robot Splinter (used in \\"Plan 6 From Outer Space\\") and replicas of the President and Prime Minister (\\"Cowabunga Shredhead\\"). This is as close to the old series as the new one gets, and manages to be mindlessly fun while playing everything straight-faced (gotta love that 'Superfriends' battle charge).<br /><br />With a great 2-parter and a flawed but entertaining 3-parter, this disc comes recommended. Now bring on season 3!
B0006399FS|5.0|U2 has gained a lot of fans over the years, and most of these fans suffer from nostalgia based reviewing of a new album rather then reviewing the album based on its merits as a stand alone record. <br /> <br />They are reviewing new U2 albums such as How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb and All That You Cant Leave Behind based upon how they remember Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby making them feel 14 and 18 years ago respectively.  I don't really see this as being a fair way to review an album. <br /> <br />I am going to try and review this album based on the context of the work on the album itself and nothing else. <br /> <br />The album starts off with the guitar driven Vertigo which at first glace just seems like a fun rock track to rock out too, but as with most U2 tracks there is a deeper meaning in the lyrics, they are most certainly very religious and spiritual and at the same time have the biography of U2 within the lyrics with lines such as \\"They know that they cant dance, at least they know\\" and of course the opening line signifying the album number that Steve Lillywhite produced. <br /> <br />The record then shifts gears to what many hardcore U2 fans consider to be one of the finest tracks on the album in Miracle Drug.  This is a track about a paralyzed student from U2s high school that was completely paralyzed till the age of 14 until they found a drug that would help him to be able to type and they soon discovered that he had been creating poetry in his head for years and was now able to write it down for everybody to see.  The track has classic Edge ringing guitar and for a \\"mid-tempo\\" track certainly has a lot of power in the instrumentation. <br /> <br />The album then shifts gears again to a more personal track for Bono himself Sometimes You Cant Make It On Your Own.  This track was finished after Bono's father died a few years ago, and really explains the difficult relationship they had with each other (as I think most parents and children do at one pointor another).  This track is bound to be a U2 classic ballad in the same way as One and With Or Without You are. <br /> <br />The next track Love and Peace Or Else is a very highly charged political track that asks some very valid questions about the reasons human civilization goes to war.  It is quite experimental in the instrumentation with driving guitars and distortion; this track is one that most would agree would fit right on to Achtung Baby if anything on this record does.  It would make a great opener for the live show coming up soon. <br /> <br />City of Blinding Lights is a song about New York City which has the nickname \\"City Of Blinding Lights\\".  Bono has stated that it is a song about naivety and innocence.  This should be another hit among the U2 fan base because it has the ringing guitar styles that were first introduced on Unforgettable Fire and expanded upon on Joshua Tree with tracks such as Where The Streets Have No Name. <br /> <br />All Because Of You which is the second North American single on the album is U2's love song to The Who and bands of the generation they grew up in that made U2 want to be in a band in the first place.  This is probably the most classic rock track on the album and should be an excellent live tune to turn up the tempo of the concerts. <br /> <br />A Man and A Woman is a track about Bono and Ali his wife growing up in Dublin getting married and then having the life altering experience of Bono becoming a rock star having to deal with being in love over long distances while U2 is on the road and being faithful to the ideals of marriage. <br /> <br />Next comes another track that has political and religious undertones Crumbs From Your Table.  This track mostly asks questions of religion and the church in general asking people to give of themselves but wondering if the church does enough in return for the people.  One of the harder tracks guitar wise on the album. <br /> <br />One Step Closer is another track about Bono's father going through life and approaching death, as would be seen in a dying persons eyes.  This is the quietest most ambient track on the album, it tries to take you to a place rather then communicate just an idea.  This is the one track that probably won't get played live as a full song on tour but is one of the most beautiful on the record. <br /> <br />Next comes Original Of The Species which is another very strong ballad with a string section and piano included.  Many people would think of The Beatles when listening to this track closely.  Should be a single and is most certainly one of Bono's best vocal performances on the entire record. <br /> <br />Last but not least comes the religious track with the name of Yahweh.  This is a Jewish word for a higher power or \\"God\\".  The track speaks of morals and life lessons along with concepts of being good to your fellow human and being good to yourself.  This is an excellent closing track and would make an excellent show closer. <br /> <br />Overall this album is quite conventional but so was The Joshua Tree, and does anybody ever complain about that album?  In my opinion this album is certainly in the top 5 U2 albums and for me is more like the top 3.  It takes more then one listen to truly understand the greatness of it but that is the way most great records are.   <br />

B00062ZE3U|3.0|I cannot possibly review Silent Force without mentioning Within Temptation's last album, Mother Earth. <br /> <br />I heard the song Mother Earth while driving one night, as a clip played into the Drudge Report. Words could not express what I was hearing - I knew it couldn't be popular. When Drudge came on he said how quite a few listeners ask about that song, which he came across while in Europe, by a band called Within Temptation. <br /> <br />As a little history, Within Temptation started as a very different band, with the 'Beauty and Beast' element of female vocals, with male growls. It was unfortunate that such beautiful music could only be found with the accompaning growls, until Mother Earth. This album was evolutionary. Talented Eurometal for those who squirm at the unappealing vocals, and better yet - this singer didn't seem so overly sure of herself, it was like unreleased potential. <br /> <br />That's how I saw the band, with the potential to become one of the greatest talents in symphonic metal, but with the inevitable possibility of digressing further from their origin. <br /> <br />It's unfortunate that success is the bane for so many hopeful bands that are met with unprecedented glory. Within Temptation weren't called sell-outs before, but after they released their Stand My Ground single, a lot of us American fans who grew to appreciate European bands like Nightwish and After Forever were disgusted. Who did they write this music for? Not their old fans. But I cannot give this 1 star - this album will have a fandom that appreciates the electronic crap in the background that compliments so nicely Sharon den Adel's synthetically enhanced vocals that are fittingly void of any real emotion. <br /> <br />I only hope that those who do enjoy this album can come to appreciate Within Temptation's previous music, and who knows, maybe learn to enjoy the B & B elements of European metal as well.

0440180295|5.0|This was the first book I read by Kurt Vonnegut, and in my opinion, the best book to read as an introduction to his work. The next book I read after SF-5 was Cat's Cradle, and I doubt I could have understood it if it wasn't for SF-5. Vonnegut's writing is not for everyone - he often uses strange, outlandish elements of science fiction and the like that take some getting used to.<br /><br />Slaughterhouse-five follows the story of Billy Pilgrim, a private in the US army during World War II. Vonnegut tells us right away that Billy is 'unstuck in time', and throughout the book we make seemingly random trips to parts of Billy's life. Later in the book, Billy is allegedly captured by aliens and taken to their planet, Tralfamadore. In he very center of the plot is the destruction of Dresden, a completely civilian city in Germany that was demolished by an Allied firebombing. A reference to Dresden crops up almost every other page, revealing Vonnegut's obsession with this event he witnessed. There are many seemingly contradictory elements in SF-5, such as Tralfamdorian philosphy vs the theme of the book.<br /><br />However, anyone who says that SF-5 is just a silly, mashed-together jumble of weird, absurd, unconnected events is reading it too shallowly. In English class, I wrote an in-depth literay analysis of this book. I picked a very narrow topic and still wrote 16 pages without having to fluff it out at all. I could have written thirty pages, but the limit was 10 (I eventually pared it down to 12).<br /><br />A lot of people don't like SF-5 because they say its theme \\"War is Bad\\" gets too repetitive. A careful reader, though, can see that Vonnegut approaches the topic from many different angles, even from the seemingly random science fiction elements. SF-5 is a magnificently deep, poignant, yet still funny book. It is one of my favorites and I reccomend it to everyone without hesitation!<br /><br />Anyone who is having trouble understanding this book should try and read some criticism or analysis of it. Go to the library, go to the computer card catalog, type in \\"Slaughterhouse-five, Vonnegut\\" and see what you get.and read some criticism or analysis of it.

B000002USN|3.0|As a youngster, I always associated Frank Sinatra's music as not being in step with the times.    As I entered adulthood, I soon realized the error of my ways - that Frank Sinatra is one of the great artists of all time.   Recently, I listed what I thought were the Top 10 musical acts of the 20th Century.   I had The Beatles #1 and I had Frank Sinatra #2.  I don't think this assessment was far off - after all, how many artists have a weekly music show (i.e. \\"Saturday with Sinatra\\") dedicated to them?   However, in the world where the radio airwaves are dominated by Rock and Pop stars, Frank's greatness often gets overlooked.  Sinatra wasn't a Rock Star, but a true Pop Star.   His music could often transcend musical boundaries.    Sinatra's \\"Duets\\" album provides a way to bridge Frank's greatness with what is being played on the musical airwaves.  On \\"Duets\\", Frank sings duets with some of the best contemporary artists out there.  <br /> <br />For some reason, I think \\"Duets\\" often gets a bad rap.   Many people did not like this album.    I found this a very enjoyable album.  It contains 13 tracks (actually 15 songs becuse \\" two songs are medleys of two songs).  All of these tracks are classic Frank Sinatra tunes.   On each track, Frank is \\"paired\\" with a Contemporary Music Artist that will sing a duet with Frank.   With some clever production work from producer Phil Ramone, the end result is a great product.   However, there are two reasons I can see where some of the protest comes from this album:   First up, this was one of the last albums that Frank would make (it was released in 1993).   Clearly, one this collection, Frank is well past his peak - and you can hear it in his voice.  However, I wouldn't have written off The Chairman of the Board just yet - at age 78, Frank still sounds head and shoulders above many other artists.   The other reason is one that I can understand -  Unfortunately, the Contemporary Artists that do the \\"duet\\" with Frank are doing so with a pre-recorded tape.    Although Ramone does a great job at hiding this fact, it is hard for me to get this out of my mind.   I keep thinking - \\"If Frank would have actually done this in the studio with each of the Artists - we would be talking one of the great albums of all time\\". <br /> <br />The best way to look at this album is to look at each of the duets.  Some duets are what I term \\"dream matchups\\". Some will pull off the duet better than others.  <br /> <br />\\"The Lady is a Tramp\\" is a duet performed with Luther Vandross.  Vandross uses his classic soulful voice and it blends beautifully with Frank's.   One of the better tracks. <br /> <br />\\"What Now My Love\\" has Frank teaming up with Aretha Franklin.  The Queen of Soul meets The Chairman of the Board.  Although I'm not an Aretha fan, this song also comes across beautiful - the contrast of Aretha and Frank's voices make for some great music. <br /> <br />\\"I've Got a Crush On You\\" - this song has Barbra Streisand performing with Frank.   When I compare this with some of her other duets she has done (i.e. Barry Gibb and Neil Diamond), this one doesn't measure up as well.  Frank steals the show here. <br /> <br />\\"Summer Wind\\" - sort of a \\"dream team\\" matchup between two great crooners - Frank with Julio Iglesias.  Julio's Latin swing in this song compliments Frank perfectly. <br /> <br />\\"Come Rain or Come Shine\\" has Frank doing a duet with Gloria Estefan.  Although this isn't one of my favorite duets, this is one of those songs in which the Contemporary Artist sounds very different from her normal environment - Gloria shows a different side to her music here. <br /> <br />\\"New York, New York\\" features another \\"dream team\\" matchup of crooners as Tony Bennett joins Frank.  Tony's talents aren't limited to San Francisco.  This is the collection's strongest set as Tony adds a whole new dimension to this song. <br /> <br />\\"They Can't Take That Away From Me\\" is a duet with Natalie Cole.   I don't think this duet comes off as smooth as the others, but Frank's voice still shines. <br /> <br />\\"You Make Me Feel So Young\\" doesn't have Frank paired up with a modern singer. \\"Old timer\\", Charles Aznavour teams up with Frank.  This is another \\"dream team\\" matchup - one of the outstanding numbers <br /> <br />\\"Guess I'll Hang My Tears Out to Dry/In the Wee Small Hours of the Morning\\" is a two song medley with Carly Simon.   Carly sounds much different than in her pop environment.  She does an admirable job, but this duet doesn't mesh very well. <br /> <br />\\"I've Got The World on a String\\" has Frank teamed up with Liza Minelli.   Liza was born to do a duet with Frank - this song comes off well. <br /> <br />\\"Witchcraft\\" has Anita Baker performing with Frank.  This one is right up there with the Bennett and Aznavour duets as one of the elite ones on the collection.  Baker's voice really blends well with Frank's. <br /> <br />\\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" has Frank teamed up with U2's Bono!  Bono does a great job on this one.  He proves how versatile he is. <br /> <br />\\"All The Way/One For My Baby\\" is the one song where Frank sings solo.  He is actually teamed up with Kenny G on this one.  Kenny G only provides instrumentals on this one.  I'm not a Kenny G fan, but I like what he brings to this song. <br /> <br />The liner notes contain a cover picture of Frank my LeRoy Neiman.  The CD is actually packaged in a jewel case with a cardboard slipcase. There is a nice eight page writeup on the making this CD by David Wild.  The lyrics for each song are not included, but the production credits are.  This CD could have been more, but it still is pretty good.   I'd recommend checking it out.
0694013013|4.0|After I read this to my 15-month old for the first time, he remembered the gorilla on the cover, and that in the book the gorilla thumps his chest.  Now, whenever we say \\"gorilla,\\" he thumps his chest, and we recite the book text to him, which is, \\"I am a gorilla, and I thump my chest.\\"  Sometimes he thumps his chest w/out prompting, and we also recite the text to him.  I believe the text and pictures are interesting for young toddlers, especially if read with a rhythm.  However, as far as imitation goes, probably 18-month olds and older would best grasp these pictures, what the text means, and how to imitate what the animals are doing.
B0002YJ29O|5.0|This belongs in all piano and string collectors' libraries.  It is the sort of item one will certainly return to  and share with music-loving friends.<br /><br />The Verbier Festival, in a truly beautiful Swiss village (are there Alpine Swiss villages that are not beautiful?) is one of the lesser known but most prestigious summer festivals in Europe.... it simply attracts the best of the best to teach and guide the students who attend the Festival Academy.<br /><br />Without detracting in any way from the feat of Martin T:Son Engstr&ouml;m, Verbier's founder, something which should be acknowledged  repeatedly, is the tremendous debt of gratitude we music lovers owe Martha Argerich and Gidon Kremer.  Their ability to bring together, not only in Verbier, but in various other venues as well, the, arguably, \\"best and the brightest\\" of musicians to play together for the sheer joy of music-making is unparalleled in my lifetime.  Perhaps Marlboro, in the days of Rudolf Serkin and Casals was an approximation, but not to the degree that Kremer and Argerich, together and independently of each other have achieved. The artistry and happiness their chamber music playing bring can be enjoyed in many live recordings that have stemmed from these gatherings (e.g. the Argerich Schumann celebration and Kremer's various Lockenhaus outings). These are musicians coming together to celebrate the art of music: their joy is infectious.<br /><br />As to the DVD: it records the Festival's 10th anniversary which coincided with it's founder's 50th birthday.  No solo playing is offered but there is music for piano four hands, 2-pianos 8 hands, 4 pianos and string orchestra, and, astonishingly, eight pianos. Imagine the array of pianists: Martha Argerich, Evgeny Kissin, Emmanuel Ax, Leif Ove Andsnes, Mikhail Pletnev, Claude Frank, Staffan Scheja, Lang Lang and Jimmy Levine.  Imagine the string orchestra: Gidon Kremer, Vadim Repin, Renaud Capuçon, Sarah Chang, Ilya Gringolts, Yuri Bashmet, Nobuko Imai, Christian Tetzlaff, Nikolaj Znaider, Dmitry Sitkovetsky, Mischa Maisky, Boris Pergamenschikow, Patrick de los Santos. In my lifetime I do not recall so much soloist talent gathering to play with each other in any one stage..... not even the Carnegie Hall \\"Concert of the Century.\\"<br /><br />And the music! From the sublime to the bombastic, one draws energy from witnessing the rapport, dedication, and, again, joy, these masters bring to playing together, and of course the musical results they achieve.  In purely musical terms, highest points for me were the  Mozart Sonata for piano, four hands, K.521, (Argerich and Kissin), and the Bach concerto for four pianos, particularly the ecstatic second movement (Pletnev, Levine, Kissin and Argerich). Everything is at least interesting and never less than fun..... when the eight pianos come together I particularly enjoyed the Rossini Semiramide Overture and the Flight of the Bumble Bee.<br /><br />Get this.  I assure you you will enjoy it many times over. And our thanks to all these wonderful musicians and to Mr. Engstr&ouml;m for making it all happen.... and to BMG for producing such a fine DVD.... the DTS is great.o Imai, Christian Tetzlaff, Nikolaj Znaider, Dmitry Sitkovetsky, Mischa Maisky, Boris Pergamenschikow, Patrick de los Santos.

B00004R99J|2.0|When I first saw Pocahontas years ago as a child, I was entranced with its beauty and charming story.  I still am- but only with the former.  Pocahontas has arguably the most stunningly gorgeous animation of any Disney movie.  Unfortunately, beauty of any kind is rarely seen outside of the movie's backdrop.  Everywhere from beginning to end is fraught with violence, and while the violence never bothered me, it is the hypocritical way the stereotypes are played off of it that did.  The English are all cartoonish (granted, this is a cartoon but this is really excessive, similar to depictions of the Romans in paintings of Jesus), except for the heroically Aryan Smith.  Meanwhile, the Powhatan are proud and noble-looking with dream bodies.  Also, the Powhatan are displayed as peace-loving people who want only to be one with nature, but they are really just as \\"savage\\" as their British counterparts (for instance, even though they may sing about how seasons go and seasons come, steady as the beating drum, their happiness stems from a war victory).  Then, there are a plethora of historical innaccuracies, but to expect Disney to conform to the story of an eleven year old, somewhat unattractive native girl who later dies of syphillis and an exploitave white man who are nothing more than friends would not make for good movie-watching, so I wish that people would stop whining about this particular aspect.  All the same, the movie-watching isn't great for any conciensious adult.  The double standards and stereotyping totally belie the movie's message of tolerance.  While I understand that many tribes felt a special connection with nature, I don't believe anyone would go so far as to tell everyone that she heard a talking tree telling her to listen with her heart (not to mention that Smith can see the tree too, showing that her communication isn't solely with the tribe).  And the chief is hardly condemned for almost bringing a bloody death on a framed Smith, because the chief isjust a poor victim of the vicious, greedy and suspiciously Jewish-looking Governer Radcliffe anyway.  The songs are all right but often preachy and, once again, stereotyping.  Should you watch this movie, turn down the sound and enjoy the scenery, because that's about all there is to enjoy.
B0006HC0I2|5.0|Like a fine wine, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI has aged wonderfully. Under the expert and loving hands of the folks at Criterion, we have an absolutely pristine print of this understated and refined French gangster movie. Watching the Criterion DVD is to fall completely into the film, as the restored black and white images are simply glorious. <br /> <br /> <br />This movie is not like today's heavy-handed violent gangster movies, but a more elegant and sophisticated presentation that focuses on character development and its themes of loyalty, betrayal, and an adherence to a moral code. Jean Gabin, who plays the urbane and respected criminal Max, is the soul of this movie, presenting Max as charming, stoic, and ruthless. Great detail is given to ordinary tasks, like the serving of a meal, brushing of one's teeth, etc., but the effect, instead of arty, goes to the development of the characters and the portrayal of them as regular folks. <br /> <br /> <br />Lest you believe this is a slow talky picture, there are moments of explosive violence that will send a chill through you. Suspense is created through the most effective of methods: by what you don't see and what is filled in by one's own imagination. As the tension mounts in the movie, you will be glued to the screen gripping the arms of your chair with withering anticipation. They don't make 'em like this anymore, neither here nor in Europe. This movie is a fine example of both  French cinema before the New Wave, and of the gangster genre. <br /> <br /> <br />In any language, TOUCHEZ PAS AU GRISBI means film excellence, especially after the careful, painstaking restoration by Criterion Studios.
B000059T5O|2.0|Okay, Tom is one of those artists who's music transfers well to almost anyone's interpretation. They are just damn good songs, and it's hard to mess up a good song. But listening to this music is like hearing Tom Waits emasculated, or maybe a Stepford Tom Waits. Hammond's voice and delivery doesn't even approach the pathos or spirit of Tom's. Sure it has a nice \\"Blues groove\\", but the spirit of Waits is lost in this recording. If Tom's music is smoked brandy,this music is a blended daiquiri with a paper umbrella. Holly Cole, who is, sometimes, so upbeat I want to slap her, gives a much more sensitive, gritty, and moving performance of Waits' songs than this Julie-Andrews-Guy. If you want mediocrity, buy this cd. If you want artistry, pass it by.
B000031EGV|5.0|What can I say? This is quite possibly the greatest movie of all time. Screw Roger Ebert and his One and a Half stars. He's an idiot. I don't know what Peter Travers gave it but listen to him anyways.
B000002UJQ|5.0|Radiohead is one of my favorite bands, and this is my favorite album from them. It really is a masterpiece in every sense of the word. I can't think of any weak tracks (Yes, I even enjoy Fitter Happier), and only one of the tracks (Fitter Happier) is just good. The rest range from \\"one of the best songs I've ever heard\\" to \\"really good.\\" I could go on talking about all the songs, but I don't want to stretch the page so I'll make it short and just give 3 of my personal favorites. <br /> <br />\\"Paranoid Android\\" - A spectacular multipart epic whose different parts don't seem connected at all when listened to sperately, but somehow Radiohead makes them fit together. <br /> <br />\\"Let Down\\" - A guitar-based rocker that has a great chorus and one of the best \\"buildup\\" sections I've ever heard. I love the doubletracked vocals too. <br /> <br />\\"No Surprises\\" - This is the song that belongs in the \\"one of the best songs I've ever heard\\" category. From the simple instrumentation to the great lyrics to the fantastic melody... It's all awesome. Perfection. <br /> <br />So yeah. I'm done gushing over this album, and everyone that has even a slight interest in rock should buy this CD immediately.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Obviously I haven't seen the DVD yet -- but I did see the Director's Cut three times during the two weeks it played in Boston last September.  The restored footage does two things.  First, it enhances and fleshes out what was already a wonderful troubled-adolescence story.  Second, and more importantly, it moves the movie away from David Lynchian ambiguity and makes it, instead, what the director always intended: an airtight, completely explicable work of science fiction, one whose basic, essential storyline can be fully grasped on the first viewing (as evidenced by the half a dozen DD newbies I dragged with me, all of whom got it and all of whom loved it).  There is still, of course, an astonishing amount to be grasped on repeated viewings: the more I saw it, the more it moved me.   <br /> <br />Donnie Darko would be a ***1/2, 9/10 movie if it had no sf element at all, if it were just a conventional story of a troubled teen.  Combine that with a mind-expanding, intricate sf story that says profound things about the nature of destiny and free will -- and you get what is almost certainly the greatest non-futuristic, non-eye candy work of sf cinema.
B0006399FS|2.0|I have been a longtime U2 fan, and this album simply fails to deliver.  The opening song \\"Vertigo\\" is catchy, but the rest of the songs sound flat.  This is an overall uninspiring album...very disappointing, given the strength of U2's last album \\"All that you can't leave behind.\\"  Let's hope their next release is better.
B0006IIPIK|5.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow - This is a great movie. It is beautifully filmed and has a plot that will remind you of all those classic adventure stories plus sci-fi greats like Flash Gordon and Buck Rogers. The movie was almost 100 percent CGI, but it doesn't take away from the movie at all. Jude Law is great at playing the epic larger than life hero who is never beaten no matter what the odds. The gadgets are fun, and the robots are cool in a retro yet futuristic kind of way. I highly recommend this movie!!!
630529142X|4.0|While it doesn't equal the twin masterpieces Billy Madison and Happy Gilmore, Waterboy is still Sandler's third best film. Also good were The Wedding Singer and Little Nicky. But he blows hot and cold, and I don't just mean hiding his comic talent behind action movies like the okay Bulletproof or behind voiceovers for the boring Eight Crazy Nights animation.<br /><br />Many of his other flicks just all out reek - the rank remake Mr. Deeds, the dud chick flick 40 Dates In 40 Days, the stinker Spanglish, the puke-fest Punch Drunk, and the bomb Big Daddy. In fact, Big Daddy (a blatant rip-off of the already crappy Dutch) is one of the worst films I've seen ANYBODY do.<br /><br />But getting back to Waterboy, I don't even like football, but this thing is great! And besides Sandler's perfect performance here, Faruza Balk is unbelievably hot in this. In fact, she's so attractive and steamy that she steals every scene she's in. That would be distracting in a drama, but in a comedy it's a forgivable sin. I mean it's not like she's the DEVIL or anything!<br /><br />As an added bonus, the music throughout this movie is also fantastic! So although he has faltered in some films, when Sandler's on, he's really ON!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|So. You've decided you will never get the chance to scale Everest and would be willing to satiate your adventuresome desires by merely listening to the Everest of large group Jazz recordings? Look no further, my friend, than this mountainous achievement by the Pat Metheny Group. Long term PM/PMG fans will know what I mean when I say it brings tears to my eyes just thinking about how great this is - you know, the way only PM and crew can connect one wonderful string of notes to the next? But in this case with a new level of texture upon texture and layer upon layer that simply leaves the listener in awe. It must be experienced to be believed - if in fact it can be believed. A new standard that would seem impossible to surpass next time.  Oh, I forgot, I'm talking about the Pat Metheny Group.
B00005JN2X|5.0|This is an amazing pshycological thriller with great action scenes! The way that Mann shot it is superb and I watched it twice in the same week, this week that is!  <br />It's all shot in LA, over one night, and despite the trap of making a boring, typical action movie, these guys make the most out of LA by night!  <br />Great twist, although nothing remarkable, but the overall film experience is worth it. Once again, Tom Cruise shows that he knows how to choose scripts and directors!  <br />Well Done! <br /> <br />
B00008K78M|5.0|That is a perfect Dvd concert. All of her best songs are on it. If you are interrested on purchasing this dvd, don't shop around, amazon as the lowest price.
B00005JNEW|5.0|The script itself isn't the most special thing in the world, neither is the story really.  It's the way its told.  Peter Berg made two great decisions in his movie-making, number 1 Billy Bob Thornton, number 2 Explosions in the sky.  Billy Bob grounds this movie, he is the observer, the one that makes you care about everyone on the field.  You can see the empathy in his eyes, you can see how much he cares about his players, his guys.  It gives the film a resonance not many sports films have.  The other part is the music courtesy of Austin-based Explosions in the Sky.  Their brand of instrumental rock fits perfectly, alternately evoking nostalgia, innocence, beauty, the fleeting youth, what you see on screen is just given extra poignancy when they play their music.  They keep it all together.  Especially the end, which admittedly is pretty maudlin, but you can't help but be moved by what has transpired in front of you.  It's alternately honest and hopeful.  This might even be the greatest sports movie ever made, and it is hands down the best football movie ever made.
B000002L9J|5.0|One easy way to make a Smiths fan is to give them The Queen is Dead.  It's a pop masterpiece that works as a collection of singles as well as a unified album.  There are plenty of Smiths singles collections out there, but in my view they seem somewhat \\"random\\" in their cohesiveness.  Not so with The Queen is Dead; it's simply one of the greatest albums of all time.
B0002X314C|5.0|ABSOLUTELY UNBELIEVABLE.  12 of the 14 songs are good.  If he hadn't gotten vulgar on one, it would be 13 of 14.  Number 12 can be eliminated.  The bomb songs are #s 1,2,7 (didn't need snoop dog),8,9,10(sounds like pfunk), 11, 13, 14. <br /> <br />In my opinion there is no comparison to the other new soul youngsters like Anthony Hamilton whose cd was soulful but nowhere close to this one, like Alicia Keyes who had 1 and I mean only 1 soulful song on her first cd and maybe 2 or 3 decent ones on her latest cd. <br /> <br />This John Legend brings a gospell like sound, yet at times sounds like Parliament Funkadelic, Stevie Wonder, Elton John, and even the Backyard Band - are you getting me here - did you hear these sounds in the cd?  The musical arrangement, the vocal arrangement, the harmonies, the piano, the guitar sound, I could go on for days.  It is absolute awesome and ranks with almost anything soul from the 70s. <br /> <br />Most of us old school soul funk folks will tell you in a heartbeat that the music that the youngsters make today don't even come close to the classic music of the 70s, but you won't say that about this one.  This is the soul that we expected to hear from young artists and this is the cd that all others should be judged by. <br /> <br />Not even JayZ's 5-star cd \\"the blueprint\\", or Outkast's 5-star first cd has as much soul and versatility as John Legend's.  I almost gave him the nod over Maxwell.  I heard a dubbed version so don't know who wrote the songs or did the musical arrangement but all I will say to John is stick with the current formula.  I do plan to buy an orginal for myself.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Pat Metheny Group continues their search for new musical expressions that may even spawn interest from other worlds someday. This is Pat Metheny Group's best album since \\"Witchita\\", the futuristic  \\"Offramp\\", the elegant \\"First Circle\\", and the masterful effort, \\"Secret Story\\".  <br /> <br />\\"The Way Up\\" takes us on an imaginary journey to their past, present, and future. A great musician is always searching for new ways to present his/her music similar to the likes of Bach, Beethoven, Mozart, Coltrane, Miles, etc. In Pat Metheny Group's \\"The Way Up\\", they have re-invented themselves without giving up their deep-rooted sense of musical style, old and new. The multiple layered guitars play a very unique role on the album, as it seems to replace the synthesizer as a means of musical orchestration. This gives the album a \\"Steve Reich\\" like effect and a \\"new age/space age\\" groove. Pat Metheny Group has indeed leaped into a new area of sophistication through the creation of a \\"long form piece\\", lasting 68 minutes. \\"Post Bebop Jazz\\" best describes this album unlike the \\"pop jazz\\" connotations of many Pat Metheny Group releases. Pat seems to have integrated his jazz trio, his Pat and Lyle duet (Witchita), newly found sounds, and the familiar sounds of Pat Metheny Group into one album. The Group's yearning for a more complete sound including harmonica and trumpet have been fulfilled. These instruments are used beautifully on this album greatly enhancing the color palette.  <br /> <br />I enjoy, mostly, the cinematic approach, the great choice of musicians, and the melodic overtures of this release, reminding me of how the band got started. <br /> <br />\\"The Way Up\\" gets five stars! <br />
0066620996|5.0|Jim Collins wrote easily one of the most stimulating books I have ever read about organizational leadership and effectiveness. What made this book really stand out from other business-oriented books was how applicable the approach, advice, and conclusions were to all organizations -- large or small, public or private, profit or non-profit -- and to individuals' personal lives. I wholeheartedly recommend this book to anyone interested in learning about what it takes to transform yourself and your organization from mediocrity to greatness. <br /> <br />This book is a detailed and well-documented study about the differences between good and great. Collins and his team of researchers and analysts used a common-sense research methodology and readily available data on public companies for their study.  From those dry, humble beginnings, Collins transformed his team's efforts into rich and dynamic principles about life and organizations that can propel both from being just good to being truly great.  <br /> <br />According to Collins, \\"I like to think of our work as a search for timeless principles - the enduring physics of great organizations - that will remain true and relevant no matter how the world changes around us...That good is the enemy of great is not just a business problem. It is a `human' problem. If we have cracked the code on the question of good to great, we should have something of value to any type of organization.\\" <br /> <br />The book's chapters were sequential and based upon what Collins and his team learned about the journey to greatness. Each chapter contained facts, stories, statistics, and credible analysis, and ended with a summary of two distinct parts: key points and unexpected findings. While the key points were critical to reinforcing the chapters' material, I thought the unexpected findings were invaluable in exposing the common myths and misperceptions about greatness that Collins' research disproved. <br />  <br />I can honestly say that the book's content and Collins' easy-to-understand writing style kept me interested and fully engaged from cover to cover - the lines and margins of my book have my highlights, underlines, and extensive notes to prove it!  In the last six pages before the epilogue, Collins explained the broader, universal context of his work and showed how and why it can be applied to individuals and all organizations. Those very focused and powerful pages helped solidify in my mind why I consider this book one of the best and most important books I have ever read. <br />

B0006IIPIK|5.0|Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow is a film bound to polarize audiences and critics alike. Loving homage or blatant rip-off? It really depends on whether you love or hate this movie. Personally, I was transported away to this cinematic dreamland for the entire running time. Kerry Conran's labour of love is an unabashed tribute to the old pulp serials of the `20s and `30s (Doc Savage, Flash Gordon, etc.). It succeeds where previous pulp serial homages of the `90s failed (The Shadow, The Phantom, Dick Tracy). Like those films, Sky Captain successfully captures the look and feel of these vintage serials but, most importantly, it also stays true to their spirit-something that these other movies failed to do (The Rocketeer as the lone exception).<br /><br />There is an audio commentary by producer Jon Avnet. Avnet takes us through the filmmaking process in an engaging way that is also very informative. He talks quite eloquently about his role-how he allowed Conran to realize his vision but on a large budget-and mentored by him.<br /><br />Also included is another commentary track with Conran, his brother and the film's production designer Kevin Conran, animation supervisor Steve Yamamoto and visual effects supervisor Darin Hollings. Students of special effects will enjoy this informative commentary.<br /><br />\\"Brave New World: Chapter 1 and 2\\" are two making of featurettes that provide a fascinating look at how this production came together. These docs are refreshingly free of an excess of clips from the movie and a slick, over-produced look that resembles a commercial in favour of a more substantial look at how this film was made.<br /><br />\\"The Art of the World of Tomorrow\\" is hosted by Kevin Conran who describes the movie as \\"a comic book come to life.\\" Among other things, he talks about the art and architecture that inspired their vision of New York City. It is interesting to see the sources that they drew upon for their distinctive cinematic world.<br /><br />\\"The Original Six Minute Short\\" allows you to look at what Conran made, pretty much on his own over several years, that would go on to impress people like Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow-enough that they would sign on to do the movie without even looking at a script.<br /><br />There are two deleted scenes, including a good scene where Dex rescues Joe and Polly from a cage, complete with unfinished effects.<br /><br />Finally, there is a two-and-a-half minute \\"Gag Reel\\" of blown lines and general goofing around on the set.<br /><br />Sky Captain has all the markings of a debut by a first-time filmmaker. There is a go-for-broke, let's-cram-everything-in-this-one attitude that a first-timer has a tendency to adopt because they don't know if there are going to get another chance. Sadly, Sky Captain failed at the box office thus insuring the unlikely prospects of a sequel. It's too bad because it presents a richly textured and detailed world with fun and exciting characters./> <br />\\"The Original Six Minute Short\\" allows you to look at what Conran made, pretty much on his own over several years, that would go on to impress people like Jude Law and Gwyneth Paltrow-enough that they would sign on to do the movie without even looking at a script. <br /> <br />There are two deleted scenes, including a good scene where Dex rescues Joe and Polly from a cage, complete with unfinished effects. <br /> <br />Finally, there is a two-and-a-half minute \\"Gag Reel\\" of blown lines and general goofing around on the set. <br /> <br />Sky Captain has all the markings of a debut by a first-time filmmaker.

B0006399FS|1.0|<br />U2 alienated most of their American fan base by releasing All That You Can't Leave Behind. Despite they gave a whole decrease in creativity, it was a smash, surely helped by the whole media and all that September 11th thing. <br />They weren't smart at all in trying to repeat the same formula. They just took the easiest way. They didn't notice fans are so tired of the mainstream 2000 era, including me. <br /> <br />This new crap should have been taken out and shot, hype included.  <br />The safe, mainstrean, radio frienly and self-indulget direction is the worst choice for any band. You can notice that after listening to this. Every artists whom make a 'back to our roots' intended album just release their worst album ever. And this 'bomb' is the worst U2 album they've ever made, believe it or not.  <br />REALLY it should have never been made, it's atrociously bad, as bad as Bono's voicing. This album it's not artistically valid to be respected. Do you think Pop is that bad ? you should check your ears with your doctor. Pop is the quintessential U2 at their most explosive creativity.
068987474X|4.0|This book made for some pretty good entertainment.  I could not put the book down because the responses were quite funny.  The scenarios and answers were blantantly obvious, but reading Greg's responses were a good laugh.  Sometimes the book was a little offensive to women's intelligence, but then I looked at many of my friends (and myself included) and realized women do and think dumb things when it comes to men!  Sometimes you do just need that slap in the face to know he's just not that into you!  The book is obviously intended for laughs, not for any real self help when it comes to men, so if you are looking for just a good laugh, get this book!
B00009V7T2|5.0|I had been beaten into submission by the horrifically contrived music of our current pop culture.  I was becoming my parents as I turned to the classics of my generation.  Then I heard this album and my faith was restored that someone could create a record with more than just a single.  This album is built with layers of lucious guitars and unique melodies.  You can hear ATDI on some of the songs but there is so many other sounds on this album.  You can listen to one song 10 times and hear something new on every listen.  Omar stakes his claim as one of the most creative guitarists around. Cedric falls somewhere between Geddy Lee and Jello Biafra.  To me This album pushes musical boundries in the same way as OK Computer and Paul's Boutique.  Is it a punk band trying to do prog, or a fusion band trying to play punk?  As others have said a very rewarding listen if you enjoy hearing more than just a lame hook.

1400032717|4.0|I enjoyed this book -- and I often avoid novels because they are too much like work.  I'm writing this review because readers should know that in the U.S., the protagonist would be diagnosed with high-functioning autism, and not Asperger's Disorder.  The novelist conveys something of what it must be like to be autistic.  I hope readers are also attuned to the devastation that the disorder causes to the family life.  The book is inspiring -- when my day gets hard, I think of drawing a line on the floor and walking it...
B00064MW6A|4.0|I just viewed my birthday present last evening and in a word, this was loads of fun!!!!!  Halle is as luscious as ever.<br /><br />First of all, this is basic comic book fare.  Therefore those of you expecting a Masterpiece Theatre production should get a grip.<br /><br />Of course the plot may not have been overwhelming.  But neither was it in Superman, Spider Man, Hellboy, Hulk, or Spider Man II for that matter.<br /><br />And why would Halle attach herself to a project such as this?  There are infinitely more important intangibles here at work.<br /><br />How many young girls of color ever get to have such a beautiful, award-winning actress, of color, personify the empowerment of women?  I submit that Catwoman is a wonderful exercise in showing how pivotal one's blossoming can be - the movie also addresses the dilemma of accepting responsibility for one's own actions as well an interesting foray into choosing good over evil (or vice-versa).<br /><br />Of course I have seen movies with better plots, tighter screenplays, more inticate direction, more elaborate sets, blah, blah, blah.<br /><br />One thing is certain:  NONE of them have Halle Berry slinking up and down the street as Catwoman, the LAST Dominatrix, so sexy and fectching and just plain WORKIN' NERVES!!!!!! Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh, it just doesn't get much better than THAT!!!!!<br /><br />The movie was fun. Did it need (or purport to be) more than that? I daresay any of the other recent comic book adaptations provided much more either and yet critics were infinitely kinder.  No matter.  The nature of the beast.<br /><br />Halle and company made a fun, entertaining movie that teaches basic life lessons in a familiar millieu.  Additionally, a priceless special feature of the DVD was the \\"Face of Catwoman\\", a featurette chronicling Catwoman's many incarnations narrated by none other than Eartha Kitt!!!!!!!
B00007FOMP|5.0|I remember when this album was released in 1971.  The tracks are still a fresh today.  When you think about it, this was a statement to the Black American community when this album was released.  The message was that violence and war was not the answer to our problems.  This was a challenge to better our lives and communities.  It's the best R&B release in history!
0618001905|3.0|There are times, when you read something that you know inside, you don't really want to believe. This book tells the story of how in an effort to get his piece of the pie, King Leopold colonizes the Congo region of Africa. The king tells the world of the great things he is doing for the people while covering up the atrocities that are being committed. <br /> <br />King Leopold realizes that most of the European powers have carved up Africa and Asia and are raking in money. Leopold wants Belgium to get her share of the colonial pie and searches what is left of the world. Settling on the Congo region, Leopold proceeds to rape the country for everything that it has. <br /> <br />I had heard of some to the terrible things done in the name of colonial times, but I was not aware of this story. It is sad to think that most people do not know about this and how a king's desire to have a colony for Belgium. Leopold spends a tremendous amount of money and time trying to cover up what is really happening, and to discredit the people trying to bring these events to the world. <br /> <br />This book is hard to read for some of the decriptions of what happens to the African people. It is a subject that more people should know about.
B00000G3I2|4.0|A common thread in the reviews of this film take issue with Glenn Close's \\"sacrifice\\" at the end of the movie.  Anyone who understands the character understands that it's not a \\"sacrifice\\" at all.  Just what the consequences are (if any) to her marriage and friendship are not spelled out, but it is totally appropriate for her character to make the decision that she did. (Incidentally, people do things like this qutie often, both for the sake of procreation and pleasure, and yes they do it even after AIDS).  The sixties were about sexual freedom, among other things. It is interesting to me that the character's marriage and gentrification made a hypocrite and a liar out of her -- though she STILL believed in \\"free love,\\" she and her husband (Kline) assumed the traditional, monogamous, middle America model for marriage.  What did it do to her? It made her a cheat.  Part of the message of the movie is that we need to be honest with our friends, partners, and above all, ourselves.  Not only did the characters lose their \\"hope,\\" they lost the courage that it takes to live by one's own standards instead of society's. <br /> <br />Very well filmed movie. Good performances. Very true to life.
B0006GVJEE|5.0|got my copy today, finally, and was it ever worth the wait! it was always an astounding flick, but now, with all the footage back, the superbit/dts audio all add up to makimg this masterpiece a classic! like  \\"the fifth element\\" newly restored dvd to superbit and dts sound, these components take both films to the nth level of quality. get both for over 4 hours of 2of the very best films of the 90's! bravo, mr. bessun, bravo to sony/columbia house for lavishing such loving care on both great films.
6305897786|4.0|This film is a wild ride of a relic hunt. <br /> <br />I did find myself wondering \\"Is that Johnny Depp?\\" - frankly the face fur was DISTRACTING and so obviously NOT a real beard and mustache. <br /> <br />The mythology of the plot felt invented but that didn't take away from this being a very enjoyable film. <br /> <br />For some reason I can't explain, I expected a different ending - not sure what but it probably could have gone a different way. <br /> <br />Very good film - it can be watched more than once but not many times.
B00064MW6A|2.0|If you are a fan of classic comics (as I am) you will want to see this movie just to satisify your curiousity. They say curosity killed the cat, well The cat killed this movie. Rent it if you must, but don't bother to buy it.<br /><br />This movie is slow to get started. Then it is unintresting in the middle. Then it only gets worse in the end.<br /><br />I loved both SPIDERMAN movies. I liked both X-MEN movies, DAREDEVIL was ok, and even the first two BATMAN films wern't bad.<br /><br />This is more like the BOMB of the HULK. A waste of time and money.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|Napolen Dynamite It's full of hilarious random scences and bizarre quotes that you'll find yourself saying before the movie is even over. There's no profanity, no sex or anything gross like that. The characters are unlike any characters you'll ever see...<br /><br />So all in all... i have to say that this is by far one of the best movies that I have ever seen.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|I remember seeing a trailer for SHAUN OF THE DEAD as a preview to another movie I was seeing at the 'insert name of major theater chain' Cineplex 16.  I made an immediate mental note NOT to miss this one, as the concept was totally original.  More on that in a moment. <br /> <br />As it turns out, I never got to see it. So once the DVD was available, I raced to the video store to pick up a copy. What a wise investment it turned out to be. <br /> <br />Unlike the completly regrettable so-called 'horror comedies' in the 'Scary Movie-esque' style, SHAUN is for all intents a legitimate horror flick. The film does not attempt to sacrifice macabre for laughs; rather, it weaves the humour into the horror.   <br /> <br />One of the creepiest aspects of apocalyptic horror movies is that critical first day, when we first get a glimpse of the collapse of society, in this case brought on by the zombi-fication of, well, everybody.  How does our pal Shaun process this?  By completely overlooking the bloody handprints on the cooler door at his favorite convenience store.  What a stud! <br /> <br />And not to give away the ending, but the film actually comes up with a cure for death.   <br /> <br />SHAUN OF THE DEAD is an ingenious blend of comedy and gore, and makes a genuine stab--if you will--at layering its characters (my favorite scene is the argument among Shaun, Ed, and the other flat-mate at 4:00a).  It's a movie I'll be watching many more times, at least before sunset.
B0002RQ2T4|1.0|I was really excited about Ghost In the Shell Special Edition.  I am a fan of the movie which covers similar ground as Blade Runner.   Unfortunately Manga, which a lot of fans refer to as Mangled got the rights to this title. <br /> <br />The Special Edition is much much better than their original release.  The menus are very well done keeping the green terminal like computer motif represented within the film, and makes effective use of the score as background music.  Too bad the content is where the disc starts to go downhill. <br /> <br />First, the transfer and audio well done, except that for some lame brained reason, they decided to replace the closing song.  This totally throws the flow of the ending off balace.  This is a big thing in my book.  Who do these people think they are, overriding the original song?  Do they think they have more artistic talent than the creators?  They also included only english credits, while this isn't anything big, they could have taken the extra step an made a multiangle disc like what disney did for Princess Mononoke.  These are pretty glaring considering this is supposed to be a \\"Special Edition\\" <br /> <br />The new release comes with a few more extras and on a second disc.  There is the production report that was included in the first release of the DVD, but they did not include the Japanese audio track as they did with the original disc.  A new feature has been added showing the computer production techniques they used on the move, but this only has a Japanese language track.  This time around they also included a few more trailers, but are in one long single sequence showing each of the three trailers back to back. <br /> <br />The packaging is very nicely done.  The discs come in a tri-fold that is becoming more comon with dvd's these days.  That in itself comes in a clear plastic sleve with graphics printed on it.  If you own the original disc, you're just getting fancier packaging, a new extra, good menus, and multi-channel Japanese tracks (a big plus), but still with the messed up ending (a big minus).
B0000028MA|4.0|This is the soundtrack album to a pleasantly inconsequential 1992 romantic comedy, set in Seattle in the early 1990s, written and directed by Cameron Crowe (of \\"Almost Famous\\" and \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\" fame.)  The story centers around two twenty-something roommates, one of whom (played by Bridget Fonda) is in love with a not particularly up and coming rock and roll singer (played by Matt Dillon) whose band sounds an awful lot like Mudhoney--- presumably because Mudhoney dubbed Dillon's musical performances.  (This may be a good place to mention that Pearl Jam's Eddie Vedder plays one of Dillon's bandmates.) <br /> <br />Because of the time and the place and because of Dillon's character's career choice, the soundtrack became something of a showpiece for the then-fashionable \\"grunge\\" movement.  It's a fairly incomplete document (no Kurt Cobain, for starters!), and the CD drags quite a bit in the middle with three lengthy mid-tempo would-be epics which are every bit as pretentious as their titles (\\"The Battle of Evermore\\", \\"Chloe Dancer/Crown of Thorns\\", and \\"Birth Ritual\\") would imply.  But even those three songs have some interesting moments, and there are many gems on this CD.  In particular, the two Paul Westerberg tunes are two of his greatest masterpieces.  And this album introduced many of us, including me, to the Smashing Pumpkins who in 1992 were totally unknown: the SPs provide the last song on the album, \\"Drown.\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B00006AL1G|4.0|I am not a hater as the one reviewer so eloquently put it! but i think what the one reviewer who gave it only 3 stars.. feels that the early Black pioneers of that era were left out, which if not for them, this scratch DVD would not exist. but you know that's how it goes..the same happened to techno and house music, but overall the DVD is entertaining.
6305558167|5.0|(...)    As for the film \\"King Arthur\\", for being a Jerry Bruckenheimer-production, it actually wasn't too bad. The theory that inspired the story was serious and interesting (and very probable in my opinion), but the script itself was pretty thin, sure Kiera Knightley (or however you spell it) was great, and Stellan was cool as the Saxon chief, and they actually tried to make it authentic with the Woads speaking their old toungue etc. but it has nothing on the original!    I mean....  It's MAJESTIC, MAGIC, EPIC, DARK, TERRIFYING and BEAUTIFUL.  It probably has some of the most beautiful frames in movie history - you just wanna pause the film and look at the pictures!  And the score is THE all-time best -without a doubt- now isn't that enough to put it on the top-100 list?! In my opinion YES!    (...)    \\"Be silent! Be still! Now, look upon this movie... savour it! So you can say: I was there, that day, with Arthur, the King! For it's the doom of men, that they forget...\\" that's what Merlin would've told you (not an exact quote though, sorry bout that)
B0002F6BRE|5.0|This movie is very very funny. Smiling is now my favorite.  Just a sit down and enjoy the humor movie and great for ALL ages.  Will Farrell (\\"I know him\\") is great and very funny in this movie from the North Pole past the seven layers of the candy cane forest all the way to the Lincoln Tunnel. Remember there is room for everyone on the nice list.  So sit down with some spagetti and syrup, and candy and candy canes and watch.  So don't be a ninny muggins and when things get tough, the best way to spread Christmas cheer is singing loud for all to hear.
B00061QJZI|2.0|This movie, starring Will Farrell in the main role, is a weak attempt at comedy from director Adam McKay. As much as I like Farrell from his Saturday Night Live days, this movie is a little too juvenile in humor and plot to make it a good comedy.<br /><br />Farrell and his female co- star Christina Applegate fight for attention in this film as they battle it out for the role as lead anchor on the local news. Farrell has held this role on the news for many years and doesn't want to relinquish his position to a woman. The movie is set in the 1970's- a time of feminism and social revolution- and the rivalry turns into a battle of the sexes between the two adults. This is a pretty standard movie formula and it could have worked better if the writing was more engaging and the comedy more sincere.<br /><br />The humor in this film is mostly bathroom- style and the jokes are primarily the types that appeal to younger kids. There isn't much in the way of original comedy, and what little originality the film can muster up is still juvenile and silly. In a matter of seconds, most of us could think of jokes and general humor at least as good as that offered here in Anchorman.<br /><br />Will Farrell is good in this role, and I liked Applegate. The addition of Fred Willard to the cast was also a good idea, but I would have liked it if Willard had a greater role. The other supporting cast of goons is rather lame and I can think of many actors/actresses who could have done just as well. On the other hand, the script of this film makes it tough for anyone to perform very well.<br /><br />Overall, Anchorman is a movie to pass on unless you're in the mood for this type of brainless comedy. Maybe if I had been in a more giddy disposition from the start, I would have liked this film more than I did. But taken as it is, this movie is a throwaway, with only a few drops of real comedy in large pool of manufactured laughs.
B0000039QA|5.0|this album is not quit as good as ready to die but still has that impact. the beats are a different but biggie's famous flow and  rhymes are still there. this album is the fastest selling and most sold rap album on earth(acorrdin to Guiness book of world records) and there is abvously a reason why. the reason why is becauce it is simply a master pieace. Tupac and Biggie are both the greastest rappers eva but even for me(from Cali) i gotta say that Biggie was and still is betta.  <br />
1400032717|4.0|With apologies to Dave Eggers, and to critics of unoriginality, the two words in the title to this review that seem to fit most -- \\"heartbreaking\\" and \\"empathy\\" -- also seem to be the very same that appear most often on the dust jacket and in the first few pages of book.  But while not original, they descrbe the book perfectly. <br /> <br />The book is hearbreaking in the way that its autistic teenage narrator describes the emotions and feelings of the neurotypical adults in his life without being able to quite feel them.  The author works with a deft hand and the narration is virtually flawless -- we see exactly what Christopher sees, but we feel differently about it and it is in the space between that we begin to understand Christopher. <br /> <br />And that's where the empathy kicks in.  It is difficult to exaggerate the success of this book in that regard.  I'm a neurotypical reader, but at the end I felt a sense of understanding about a group of people who share my world but experience it much differently.  The book is not about feeling sorry for Christopher, because he does not feel sorry for himself.  He is, simply, different, in a way that was not comprehensible to me before, but is now.  Certain things are just as important to him as certain things are to me, but they are just different things.  His \\"burden,\\" if he has one, is living in a world arranged by and populated mostly by neurotypical people, and this book's highest achievement, to me, is making us understand that that doesn't work for everyone and for some we need to help them rearrange it. <br /> <br />So why four stars?  Well, I'll probably edit this later and change it to five, but I need think about it more.  My problem is this:  Christoper does not understand sarcasm or irony, yet on many levels the author packs quite a bit of satire in the book.  (Ironic, huh?)  I find that a touch troubling, although maybe it's actually a strong point of the book.  Gotta think about it more.
0060730552|5.0|This is the best book on why we do mountaineering I have read. <br /> <br />I avoided the book for years because I had had my own epic including 1000ft fall, crevase and wounded partner in the Italian Alps. But it was the best explanation to me on why we go to high mountains, why we solo, and for me why, one day, I stopped.  It was so good at helping me understand I have started again!! <br />The centre of the book is making decisions - to climb hard, to rescue your partner, to cut the rope, to abseil, to struggle to live.  This is why the book is a success, not becuase it is yet another tale of \\"I clipped the loose piton ...\\". <br /> <br />I cannot understand why any reviewer cannot give it 5 stars - they either have no emotion or they have not hung themselves out to dry once or twice. Or they worry about the style - shame on you.  You really do need to go climbing high mountains.

B0001CCXY8|1.0|...this band doesn't get my impression. From what I heard, some of the people hate this band and some others love it. Well, to point it out, this is the only DM band that I despise. Sure, their lyrics are sickening and funny but seeing that they have been around for a decade-and-a-half, all of their albums depict the same gory theme all over and over again. I will admit that George Fisher is actually a better vocalist than Chris Barnes. The only thing that the band impresses me is that they still play Metal. But gory themes and violence can get cliched real quick and Cannibal Corpse epitomizes that fact.    I might as well stick to better DM bands like Suffocation, Death, Nile, and Malevolent Creation. I give this review a 1.5 out of 5 stars instead of 1.
B0002OERI0|1.0|Everything they've done was great until this. <br /> <br />A commercial fake \\"so called punk rock album\\". <br /> <br />How could you not see that this would sink so low. <br /> <br />Punk rock opera - what the hell is that!
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Precisely, Mr. \\"Oh dear\\". This is precisely for us Topographic Oceans people who have moved on since then to extended improvisation, symphonies, suites and the like. We want it longer, richer, more complex, more satistfying over a longer stretch. Like a great meal, not an empty snack. The Firebird. A Love Supreme. Music For 18 Musicians. More, more, more.  <br /> <br />A protest record, indeed, as Mr. Metheny has described it, against \\"songs\\", stupid lyrics, and short attention spans. <br /> <br />So of course it's five stars. Can't wait for the score to come out so we can get together and score-read the way we did in college. <br />Peace.
B000021XR5|5.0|This is the best Stone Temple Pilots album. <br /> <br />The album switches between heavy but edgey guitar riffed songs such as \\"Down\\" \\"Heaven and Hot Rods\\" \\"Sex and Violence\\" and slower more acoustic like songs such as \\"Sour Girl\\" \\"I got You\\" <br />and the brilliant \\"Atlanta.\\" <br /> <br />Without a doubt the Stone Temple Pilots best album from start to finish.  <br />Anyone who has'nt heard this band before MUST get this as well as \\"Tiny Music......from the Vatican Gift Shop\\". <br /> <br />The songs on that album are just amazing. <br /> <br />

B0000069CT|5.0|Having discovered Max Bruch's works much later than those of Mozart, Beethowen, Bach, Haydn, Schubert or Tchaikovsky, I feel that he is one of the most underrated or underappreciated composers.  While he may not be right up there with the titans, his violin concertos are a pure delight to the ear, although Mendelssohn's influence is quite obvious. Personally I prefer the first concerto, op 26, which  took him 9 years to write. It was dedicated to the great hungarian violinist Joseph Joachim, who apparently, along with Willy Hess, helped the author during the final revisions of the concerto.  I read somewhere that Hess performed himself the premi&egrave;res of many of Max Bruch's works, and later Bruch would compose the concert piece for violin and orchestra op 84 especially for Hess.<br /><br />Max Bruch may not be one of the most productive composers ever, but his first violin concerto and especially \\"Kol Nidrei\\" are a pure delight to the ear.<br /><br />  If you have a real passion for classical music and, like me recently, you are just discovering Max Bruch's music, chances are that his themes will stay in your head for quite a while. What a brilliant composer!
044024157X|3.0|As novels go, this one is a bit like Grandma's Oldsmobile, that she takes out for church once a week, or a convertible with its top down on a bumpy road.  If you're in a hurry to get somewhere, it might drive you crazy.  If you're willing to enjoy some scenery along the way, this might be the vehicle for you.   <br /> <br />The focus of the story is less on one particular juror -- in fact, it is not even clear what the title has to do with anything in the plot -- as on ten years of a small southern town as seen through the eyes of the young man who buys the town newspaper.  The journalist, who narrates the story, tells his adventures with moonshine, desegregation, small town politics, the invasion of soul-snatching malls, a lunatic and a drunk or two, remodeling a house, learning how to eat southern, and, yes, a murder trial and revenge killings.  The hero here is a writer, not a lawyer -- does the change of roles mark the evolution of Grisham's consciousness?  Anyway, I just finished writing a book myself, and was therefore in a leisurely, Sunday afternoon mood, and enjoyed the slow and meandering drive through town.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Actual footage rearranged in a way that deviates from a real timeline. Michael Moore speaks over this footage and gives his opinions. He does not support them with facts. The aim of this \\"movie\\" is to infuriate, not eduacate the masses. This film has no intellectual value except a study on current propoganda.
B0006A9FMI|1.0|I'm a big fan of Ghost in the Shell, I own the original comic, the first movie on both the regular and special edition dvds and the TV show version up to what has been released in America so far. That said, this is a horrible DVD release of an otherwise good film. Since the TV show (which airs on cartoon networks adult swim) already had a great cast of voice actors dubbing it, you would think they would put an english dub on the DVD. They could've cross-advertised with the show, which has received great ratings in a block of TV that has also been getting great ratings more or less across the board. But no, there is no english dub (an inexcusable mistake on an American Anime release) and not even a proper subtitle track. I can look past not so great cover art and weak special features. But at least make sure someone can watch the movie and follow it easily enough. It's totally unenjoyable the way it is now and I can only hope they'll pull the dvd and get a real special edition out with English Dub and subtitles done in the proper anime format.
B000002UAX|5.0|This was my first Beatles album. It was also the first album I ever heard of by the Beatles.  I have it on white vinyl and I also have it on CD.  Paid 4.00 for both CDs from a used CD store. And the CD plays good, no skips whatsoever.  My favs are every song on this record.  I really can't single one out.  Lennon to me is the one who made this group what it is.  He is the guiding force behind making this album really incredible.  I miss him dearly and I wish that folks would give him the credit he deserves.  I can't believe this album came out from this group.  I wonder what it would be like to have just released this as just one album and then release a White Album II later.  Sounds interesting.  I think that is what Martin actually wanted but the two record set prevailed.  Still, very prolific; some really good songs on here.
B0000E6XH3|5.0|Words can not express the feelings I had after watching the movie - just as they were not needed to tell the story. Daft Punk is Thomas Bangalter and Guy Manuel de Homem Christo (both French) and the Discovery animation is done by animation legend Leiji Matsumoto. After first hearing those guys years ago on Toonami, I then spent forever scouring the boundless field of drivel that is the internet trying to find the videos. But as luck would have it, all I ever found were the first four. And I NEEDED TO KNOW what happened to the characters!!! I became ravenous - it took over my life!! I could think of nothing else! This movie will change your life. After watching it for the first time, I sat and stared at the screen for minutes on end. A single tear rolled down my cheek. I now have no regrets. Riveting, wonderful, catchy, upbeat, tragically sad, and so full of joy it makes you cry. Not enough good can be said about it. Buy it now!
B000000W5L|5.0|I have to tell you I almost gave up on the STones until a friend recommended this album.  He told me you would really like it.  I have to agree.  I am now a true fan of the Stones.  Mick and Keith put together one hell of an album.  \\"Let it Loose\\", \\"Rip this Joint\\", \\"Hip Shake\\", \\"Shine a Light\\" are just incredible masterpieces.  Simply incredible.  They put plenty of heart and soul into this material and I couldn't put the CD down.  I played it in the morning, played it at night, played it in the bathroom, played it for friends. I simply couldn't stop playing it.  t should be shared with as many people as possible!  This is the best Stones album ever!! The best one man you won't go wrong.  Weed and alcohol helps.  It does wonders!

B000669GAI|4.0|Pearl Jam.  Early 90's rock isn't mainstream anymore, true, but what an amazing band.  They've got twenty times the talent that any band out today has.  The music coming out now is terrible.  And I don't mean just pop, I mean the \\"rock\\", rap and everything else in between.   <br /> <br />This album is good.  I like how some of the songs were remixed especially State of Love and Trust.  Black is better on this one too.   <br /> <br />Sucks?  Speaking of whining and crying bands... why don't you go listen to some Linkin' Park?  They're \\"good\\" right?  HAHA
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Troy, like Gladiator, is relatively painless to sit through, but most likely you won't want to watch it again.  Hollywood's big budget adaptation of The Illiad conveniently came out at a time when this kind of film is at it's high.  Parts of the book are randomly tossed out to keep the action going and the target audience happy.  Characters speak in a modernized English which is annoying.  In order to guarantee box office success, a big name actor is put in the starring role, even though they're not right for the part.  In this case Brad Pitt as Achilles.  I don't really have anything against Pitt, but he's no Achilles no matter what reviewers here might say.  Obviously they never read the book. How many of you have read The Illiad and thought to yourself, \\"Boy, wouldn't Brad Pitt make a great Achilles?\\"  Probably none of you.  If memory serves, Achilles is described as seven feet tall and four feet wide.  Not very Brad Pitt-like.  Personally I think Dolph Lundgren would make a pretty cool Achilles. That would never happen though coz he's not pretty or popular enough, though he'd do a better job.  Peter O'Toole is good as usual, so is Brian Cox.  Eric Bana is a decent Hector and Orlando Bloom has finally found a role that suits his talents-a whiney wuss.  For once CGI is used to good effect, making the battle scenes impressive.  All in all not a bad film, there is much worse out there.  Makes a great double feature with Caligula, but then again any film does.
B00063MBU8|1.0|God I hate this band.  They're nothing special and sound just like every other wannabe punk band out there.  The vocalists whiny voice makes me want to slit my wrists as I don't want live in a world where music like this gets played more than the real punk legends like The Get up Kids and Goldfinger.  I only wish I could give this review zero stars.
B00005JNBQ|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen!  It's silly, it was obviously inexpensive to make, and it is aimed at pre-teens and teens.  And it does have a message that many of the other grown-ups I spoke with missed.  They mention feeling sorry Napoleon, because the cool kids are mean to him.  The main characters in this film don't see themselves as geeks or losers!  They put themselves out there and do brave things and ultimately there's a happy ending.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This was the first DT album that I purchased (although I have since been feverishly buying the back catalogue) & I would have to say that this is unequivocally the best metal album I have heard for some time. <br /> <br />FRom the rocking flow of the title track, 'As I Am' to the haunting pseudo-ballad, 'Endless Sacrifice' & the insightfully powerful 'In the Name of God', this album will leave your mind roiling with every heart-string-pulling nuance. Just wait for the chorus of 'Endless Sacrifice' which one can not help to sing along to. <br /> <br />Sure, there are, at times, extensive periods of exposition which some listeners will find too much to bear. However, The musicianship of these guys can not be denied. Their use of continously varying time signatures, catchy riffs & melodies are often offset by intense periods of chaotic dissonance. It might take several listens, but listening to this album always brings with it a new treat. <br /> <br />In a time of endless power metal clones, death metal iterations & metal players who don't know the difference between the body & the bridge of a guitar, this band stands out as a shining light. Kudos to Dream Theater.
0553381407|5.0|As a child of emotional abuse and toxic parents, I found this book to be an invaluable tool.<br /><br />Up until my early 30s I thought my family was perfect... and everyone else's was messed up!<br /><br />I sought therapy to deal with my realizations that my family was the one messed up, and I wanted to make sure I didn't repeat the same destructive patterns while raising my own child.<br /><br />This book, coupled with therapy, has helped me address repressed emotions from my child and adulthood that were results of toxic parenting.<br /><br />This book explains that toxic parents don't just become that way overnight. They were most likely raised by one or more toxic parents and so on and so on. It's an ugly cycle. You can break the cycle if you take the first step to acknowledge it, then deal with it, and finally... move forward.<br /><br />I can't tell you how much this book opened my eyes as to WHY things happened to me. I always was uneasy with WHY my parents did things they did. Now I see. I also see what happened to me until I was an adult was my parent's responsibility, and I can stop blaming myself for not being a good enough child etc... and thinking I deserved what I got.<br /><br />I have placed my anger where it belongs now, and have felt a huge weight lifted from my spirit.<br /><br />I realize how strong I really am, and am thankful I've turned out as normal as I am considering.<br /><br />I was verbally abused, forced to be a parental child, emotionally abused, controlled, guilted and manipulated, and my parents did things that today would land them in jail.<br /><br />I just can't say enough about how helpful and insightful this book is.
0385510454|1.0|I was very disappointed reading this book. What a bore! I usually stay up until the wee hours reading and I could not keep my eyes open when only reading a few pages a night of this book. Grisham really let me down on this one!
B00006IU73|5.0|Every few years, I find an album worthy of my \\"top ten desert island\\" list. One of the rare times I listened to the first 3 or 4 NOTES of an album and was actually astonished,was my first time hearing Kings X's \\"Gretchen Goes to Nebraska\\" in the late 80's. Yeah, it sure doesn't happen often.     But oh, my.... In Absentia. Dark and shimmering, like the moon in a black velvet painting - - sad & gorgeous, haunting and hopeful. Power forged with the ethereal. A glimpse into their world and it's unforgettable. Just get it.
B0002VL0KQ|5.0|My mother bought this CD for my daughter and I for Christmas, and it now lives in my daughter's CD collection.<br /><br />I've played simple, relaxing music in her room all night long since she was born, and she likes this cd over the others (even over my favorite, \\"Of Love and Hope\\" from the TV show Beauty and the Beast, the little traitor ;-}).<br /><br />The choice of songs really touches the heart of the parent, and the arrangements and gentle music and voice soothe my girl more than others do.<br /><br />I'm not a huge fan of Celine Dion's, but I'd buy or recommend this CD for any parent or expectant parent as something to acquire for themselves, or to give as a gift without a moment's hesitation of wondering \\"will they like it?\\".
B0002Z0EYA|4.0|While, \\"Troy\\" lacks \\"Gladiators\\" emotional core, \\"Troy\\" is actually a surprisingly well done action epic. Roger Ebert recently put this film #1 on his Top 10 Worst List. It was tied  <br />with Oliver Stone's \\"Alexander\\". I don't agree with this. I saw <br />\\"Alexander\\" earlier this year and it was a horrible movie. It was like sitting down and reading a Social Studies textbook for 3 hours. NOT FUN! \\"Troy\\" is a well done film, especially compared <br />to Alexander, and it is in no way a masterpiece of cinema but it certainly is not the worst film of the year. Wolfgang Peterson <br />(who directed the visually stunning and storyline illiterate \\"Pefect Storm\\") directs the film which was scripted by <br />David Benioff who wrote the screenplay for Spike Lee's \\"25th Hour\\". Brad Pitt plays Achilles, Eric Bana plays Hector, Orlando <br />Bloom plays Paris, Diane Kruger plays Helen, Brian Cox plays Agememnon, Brendan Gleeson plays Menelaus, and the wonderful Peter O'Toole plays King Priam. Prince Paris of Troy falls in love with Helen of Sparta who is married to Menelaus (I might add, they don't really make a good couple, Menelaus & Helen I mean) Due to his love for her he kidnaps her and takes her back to Troy with him, much to the dismay of his brother Hector and father King Priam. Well, obviously Menelaus is mad and asks his brother Agememnon to help him. Agememnon doesn't care about Helen, he cares about taking control of Troy. Agememnon recruits Achilles, to help him. Now, I need to add right quick. I'm not a big Brad Pitt fan. I do like a majority of his movies though. I think this is one of his best performances. People say he was miscast, but I disagree. <br />I think he was perfectly cast. He's got the body to play the character, and he's (as much I hate to admit) a fine actor. Diane Kruger, who has now appeared in both \\"Wicker Park\\" and \\"National Treasure\\" is good except she doesn't really have a lot of screen time. The story truly is about the personal battle between <br />Achilles and Hector, as well as Agememnon and well....Everybody. I need to add as well before I finish the review that i've never read \\"The Ilead\\" nor do I ever want too, so i've heard a lot of people saying it doesn't hold to the book. That may or may not be ture, but it doesn't matter to me. See this movie, it's very entertaing and the special effects are great too. B.

B00006CXSS|5.0|My only complaint is that it wasn't twice as long!  Follow Easy Company of the 101st Air Born from the stress and tension of boot camp, the horrors of Normandy, the failed campaign of Market-Garden in Holland, the cold winter at Bastogne, the liberation of Jewish concentration camps, the capture of Hitler's personal palace, to the end of the war. <br /> <br />Each episode tells the story of the entire company but also focuses on individual soldiers, officer, and medics.  Some survive to the end of the war, many do not.  By the end of the last episode I felt like I had been there and fought by their side.   <br /> <br />Again, if the series had been twice as long I still would have wanted more.  This DVD collection is a set I will watch a thousand times and not be bored.  A true masterpiece. <br />
B0000B1OFL|2.0|ITJ is a bit a dissapointment because it makes itself a film of two-halves and doesnt really engage the viewer after Donald Sutherland departs the journey ealry on.<br /><br />In short this is just simple Sunday afternoon entertainment and even the horribly mis-cast Ed Norton does not make an impact. The premise is simple. Robbers get robbed by one of their own and then go seek their revenged. Cue a few chase sequences and some personal family matters. It doesnt really ever get off the ground. Very average robbery hookum.
B00001QGPS|5.0|I own all Wu Tang Cds, most of there family works, and all there solo cds. Yes, even Cappadonna. Anyways, I decided to listen to this cd and I love it! All the songs are great and not a bad song on the whole cd! One of the best solo Wu album's ive heard so far but cannot equal ODB's (R.I.P) Return to the 36 Chambers. That cd will never be matched...greatest rap cd ever!
B00008EYA5|4.0|...check in your brains at the door on the way in. Grab a soda and just plop yourself down in front of some laughs and action for the next two hours or so.<br /><br />SWAT is VERY FUNNY! There is lots of laughs in this no-brainer action flick. The premise is simple. SWAT members get discharged for messing up an op. SWAT members get back together under the command of L. Jackson. SWAT are assigned to protect and transport a high-profile international criminal to jail..... the catch.... he just offered 100 Million dollars to whoever can bust him out. Que everyone from the Russian mafia to the street gangs trying to take on the SWAT team as they transport the prisoner.<br /><br />Again SWAT is a no-brainer! The story is total hogwash, but damn if it aint fun! ... and it is. There is lots of SWAT action and comedy along the way. It does take some time to get going but as long as you do not take it too seriously (and the film makers didnt!)... you will be in for some fun.<br /><br />It might not be the SWAT we where hoping for (the director of the remake Dawn of the Dead turned it down because they would not produce a R rated movie) but makes good action family viewing for older members.
B00005T7I1|5.0|I grew up with this movie and still love it to this day. By today's standards, it's a movie with bloodless violence that kids can watch. Guarunteed they've seen much worse. Adults can also sit through this movie, as it has a plot, and also tons of big-name actors. Al Pacino gives a priceless performance as the gung-ho visionary, Big Boy Caprice. I love his role in this movie. Even as a kid I enjoyed his ruthlessness,-\\"Next time I take his fingers, and I turn them into pretzels. I just might do the same thing to your face.\\" ((SHHMACK!!)) \\"See? He's playing better already.\\" Holy smokes! That was of course towards Madonna's character, Breathless Mahoney; a seductive sex-pot (a real strech for Madonna) who's hell bent on stealing Dick Tracy (Warren Beaty) from his girlfriend. The countless villians in this movie make it fun to try and recognize the stars in character.  <br />  All in all, a good movie. Maybe a little slow for adults, and maybe for the young generation of today as well, who are already desensitized to endless profanity and mindless gore. Just think of it as a G-rated gangster flick.
B0000AXE8I|2.0|The first Matrix was the Phantom Menace that George Lucas did not see coming... and neither did we. The original Matrix was an underdog of a movie that became a hot thing AFTER people ran out of the cinemas with their jaws covered in popcorn crumbs from hitting the sticky floor. The Matrix did have some stunning special effects, but bullet-time was nothing new. We had seen this effect in commercials, documentaries and some smaller films. However the Matrix used bullet-time as a plot device and that is why it stunned everyone. The Matrix also had this whole \\"mind-trip\\" conspiracy thing going that really drove the story forward. It was easy to understand - cyberpunk hacker is the chosen one, discovers that he is living inside a computer generated reality and uses his talents to help save mankind in a superhero sort of way. Wonderful stuff.<br /><br />The Matrix Reloaded suffers from not understanding what made the first film so good. It misses all the \\"mind-trip\\" stuff - ALL of it entirely, thus rendering Reloaded devoid of the mystical/anarchic/quasi-religious bent that the first one had. The \\"mind-trip\\" stuff messes up in three critical parts to the film - the meeting with the Oracle, the meeting with the Architect and a new revelation for Morpheus about the prophecy. Instead of playing games with the audience, like the first matrix did, this one is trying to explain things - all of which is a plot device to help forward the storyline - but instead it has a reflexive effect of simply nullifying what made the first Matrix so enchanting. Reloaded is thus left extremely open to interpretation: nothing in the first film is valid, and thus everything in this one is confusing. So instead of being intrigued you are left feeling stumped and bothered by a sequel that seems to be battering the original to death while at the same time trying to be better than the first.<br /><br />The first half hour of the Matrix is a snooze-fest. It spends time too much time on Zion, introducing new characters, and trying to setup the plot which is.... nothing, except that Neo must go visit the oracle to figure out what to do next before Zion is capitulated by a load of drones sent to attack it. But does Neo not control the Matrix somehow? Lots of what you took you granted goes out the window by this point, while the filmmakers concentrate on a sex scene between Neo and Trinity followed up on by a \\"burning man\\" dance routine that has no reason for being in this picture. There is bound to be trouble brewing. The audience is asleep until.... Neo meets the Oracle and then after that Reloaded really shows us why we came to see it by putting on the special effects in a \\"never-seen-before\\" sort of way.<br /><br />Twenty minutes into the film and you will understand that the filmmakers are not really that pushed to deliver on the story. What they want to do is create a movie that is actually the equivalent of a new \\"Theme Park\\" attraction. So basically Reloaded is playing down the story and replacing it with multi-million dollar special effects. With that in mind Reloaded is an experience like no other, but the story is given the back door treatment fairly quickly. There are some surprises in store and some plot twists that will keep you going but lurking in the background is an entity called - Joel Silver and he just wants the audience to sit there with mouths open during the special effects sequences and hopefully all other misgivings will be put aside when the audience starts doing just that. The truth is that Reloaded is a revolution in special effects, but is also Joel Silver marketing at its finest. You know that when you have seen it once that you will want to see it again, but as for the plot and storyline... well Silver thinks that is all just cannon fodder for the canvas.... and all he wants to do is paint.<br /><br />George Lucas can maybe breath a little easier now.roducing new characters, and trying to setup the plot which is.... nothing, except that Neo must go visit the oracle to figure out what to do next before Zion is capitulated by a load of drones sent to attack it.

B000286RKW|5.0|The honesty and reality of this movie is unparalelled. (did I spell that right?) Everyone turns in a performance of a lifetime. Including Ray Liotta, who needs to work more. Martin, please call this gentleman again. This movie established me as Liotta fan for life. Who didn't want to pistol-whip some guy for checking out their lady after watching this movie? An attention-grabber from begining to end, this film will live forever.
B00009RDG9|4.0|Okay so basically William Friedkin has resigned himself to producing B moving hookum with A list actors who think that Friedkin just might have that magic left in him. The truth is that the Friedkin of \\"The French Connection\\" and \\"The Exorcist\\" fame was abducted and departed this universe only to be replaced by a less than accurate decoy copy of himself a looooong time ago.<br /><br />Anyway down to the review. The Hunted is nothing more than a ludicrous story in order to set up various knife fight set pieces. The story is basically about a secret \\"Black Op\\" assassin (Del Toro) who has turned into a serial killer with a penchant for hacking up his victims with a knife. His old combat trainer (Jones) is sent to track him down and there is the usual cat and mouse type play so that Del Toro and Jones can go it at in a knife fight.<br /><br />Let the truth be told. If you go for this movie on the basis that it is a hand 2 hand combat action flick and nothing more then you will enjoy it immensely and probably try to make yourself a blade the next day given the details in this movie. However, if you think that you are in for a serial killer classic, with huge performances from Del Toro and Jones with the backing of an ace director, Friedkin - then you will only convert the DVD to a coffee cup holster in no time.<br /><br />**** stars for people who want to see lots of bloody knife fights only. All else, * star, who will probably end up using it as coffee mug accessory. However it must be noted that marines going on a rampage when they come home is nothing unique but the film never really develops that topic enough... however this is as close as you will get to it.
B0006GAOCW|4.0|I, like most people, would say it's a lot like Chasing Libery, but there are a few big differences. First Daughter is rated PG while Chasing Libery is PG-13. I have seen both of them, and I really liked this one. It may be for younger viewers, but it is still a great movie. I prefer First Daughter because I am picky about what I watch. Most movies day aren't for the younger girls. I'm in my twenties and I would rather go see the lower rated movie with the same basic story line because there aren't that many. And may be if we show we want more like this they will start making movies that everyone in the family can watch together.
B000002LAC|5.0|I first purchased this recording when it was first released.  My Mother and I used to ride in the car, playing this CD and sing along.  It took me back to my childhood days of simpler, more basic music with a hymn-base and beautiful harmonies.  I love this album, but let it get away from me during my Mother's illness.  When she passed away, I happened upon it on AMAZON once again; and never cease to be amazed at it's ability to soothe and comfort me.  The music is beautiful, the ladies are beautiful, and the price is right!
B000002UJQ|5.0|<br />I have no words for this album, it`s just the best piece of art music I`ve ever heard since Pink Floyd's \\"The Wall\\". One remarkable thing about this album is that ( unlike most of overhyped album in these days such U2`s How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb and all their crap that shows they`re sell outs - unlike Radiohead ) the best songs ( IMO ) weren`t singles: That`s something truly outstanding and it proves this album is essential and wonderful. The best songs are Exit Music ( for a film ), Lucky, Climbing up The Walls and Let Down.  <br /> <br />The music is out-of-body, arrangements, production, art, etc, every single aspect is just unique. This is the most outstanding album ever made from the 90`s. Yet in 2005 we haven`t had a truly better album than this one, and probably we will never have it. <br /> <br />The whole album is just an experience, an amazing soundtrack of our lives. This album should return to 5 stars, it doesn`t deserve less than 5 stars.
B000683VI4|5.0|This movie touched me in so many ways. It was beautifully made, mastered, and acted. The people who acted in it really made the characters come alive; they became those characters. If you missed it when you were in the theatre, rent it. This is one movie that for me was the best movie of 2004. There are so many things that I could tell you about this movie; but then that would spoil it for you. I will only say this: It's flawless in every way. As you watch it, you feel like you are watching a true story of someone's life unfold; you feel passionate, you feel sadness, and at other times in the movie, you feel gladness. My recommendation is that you rent it, and make sure you have a box of tissues near by, and a friend to hang on to. Don't see this one alone; much better to have a loved one with you as you watch it. You will love this movie each time you see it, and you'll want to pass it on to your next generation. It's a love story that you will not tire of seeing over and over and over. It's a beautifully - woven story painted by a wonderful author Nicholas Sparks.
B000268QB2|5.0|I heard their single Somewhere Only We Know at Target and I was HOOKED. I kept on hearing it every time I came to Target and found out who they were. When their CD \\"Hopes and Fears\\" went on sale for $6.99 at Target, I decided to get it since it was cheap and I was gonna give them a try. Ends up, it was a greeat idea. I love their album and can't wait to see them live! The music is veery relaxing if you're into that. If not, then too bad. It's not your band obviously. I hope they make more albums!
B00003CXA6|5.0|I have seen this movie over 100 times, and I'm still moved by it. Though the movie has some historical inaccuracies, no film out there comes as close to portraying true history as this one, especially about the Civil War. For the most part, the acting was superb, especially by Jeff Daniels. The portion of the film when Armistead speaks about his past friendship with Hancock is the most finely acted scene of any movie I have ever seen. No prequal or sequal can add to this movie, especially if they're produced and acted as poorly as Gods and Generals.
B000002LRX|5.0|This album is easily in my top ten list of greatest albums ever. Those of you who can't appreciate this album are weak minded fools.<br /><br />Angel Dust transcends music and song writing. The pure passion and emotion that bleeds from this album makes me understand that music is the ultimate expression of creating art.<br /><br />This album was a great huge `slack off' to the commercial machine of MTV and radio and for that very reason alone it can be considered genius. FNM's previous album enjoyed way too much mainstream success and the band followed up with an album that reeked of integrity, and pushed the boundaries of music.<br /><br />Every song is unique, every song is radically amazing. Years later I still marvel at the symphony of sound and power the band created on this majestic album. From the opening power of Land of Sunshine to the final notes of Midnight Cowboy - this album takes you on a passage through all limitations of genre. Every instrument and sound are perfect. Every band member reaches their peak as a continuation of one unique wall of substance.  And the lyrics - unbelievable!!  Pure and simple -  some of the greatest lyrics ever spoken by man.<br /><br />Mere labels and categories cannot apply to this band nor this album. Is it metal? Is it funk? Is it alternative? These categories are meaningless. It is Angel Dust and nothing less would do.

015603008X|5.0|It is a human quest to search for what we are, what makes us what we are. In Daniel Keyes' \\"Flowers for Algernon\\", Charly, the main character, is in search of these things -- with that, the writer pose a simples question: what makes us what we are? Charly is a mental disabled thirty something who accepts to go through a surgery that is expected to improve his intelligence and make him a `normal person'.<br /><br />The very same procedure has been successfully done to a white mouse, named Algernon. After Charly meets the hamster he is impressed of how smart the animal is, and believe that he can be even smarted than it. And he (and his doctors) is right. After the intervention, the man's IQ is skyrocketed. He starts to learn contemporary and dead languages, understand economy, geopolitics, and science... anything. Charly is a sponge that absorbs as much information as he comes across.<br /><br />But, like everything in life, there is an on-the-other-hand. Charly past memories -- that seemed to be lost somewhere in his mind -- start to arise and they are not pleasant. Most of them are related to how their parents dealt with his inabilities when he was a child. Both of them weren't able to deal with a special kid. And, while the father tried to seek for some help and loved his son, the mother pretended he was normal, at first. After another daughter is born, his mother starts to avoid Charly until she forces the father to commit him to mental facility.<br /><br />As these facts are remembered, Charly's mind starts to play tricks on him. What was real? What was a dream? What has he made up? There aren't simple answers for that. But he wants to clarify these points. At the same time, Algernon, the mouse, starts to show the first sings of deterioration. He is not as bright as he used to be. Moreover, Charly becomes a sort of celebrity in the medical world. His doctors want to show him in a convention as the living proof of how their methods can increase intelligence and help everybody -- not only disabled people.<br /><br />Everything is told by Charly, who writes compulsively reports about his evolution. One of the most interesting things about \\"Flowers for Algernon\\" is its language. At first it is like an illiterate child, with many grammar and spelling mistakes. As Charly's mind starts to evolve, so does his language and ability to express himself.<br /><br />But, little did Charly know that mankind is more complex and difficult than he could imagine. He starts to realize that the people he thought to be his friends are not really friends, and when love comes up, the man realizes that it is a complex feeling and no matter how bright you are, it is always difficult to deal with this feeling.<br /><br />Keyes has created a magnificent cast of characters. From the believable Charlie to his teacher and lover Alice, everyone is very human. His parents are beautifully developed. And however much you may hate the mother for how she treats her son, you can't blame her. The doctors, mostly Nemur --who is believed to have done something important for the mankind-- are part humanist, and part mad scientists, like Dr. Frankenstein -- and at one point, the creation surpasses the creator.<br /><br />\\"Flowers for Algernon\\" is considered science fiction. But this is one those books that makes you think and consider a many ethical and moral issues, when you try to bring the plot to real life. This is kind of science fantasia that we should encourage to be largely explored in movies and books, so that in the real world we would never take such a dangerous step.e and help everybody -- not only disabled people.  <br /> <br />Everything is told by Charly, who writes compulsively reports about his evolution.

B000002UC5|4.0|By his own account, McCartney could hardly get out of bed because he was so bummed out over the breakup of the Beatles during the time this record was being recorded. Judging by his subsequent output, that's a good thing for us. McCartney is an excellent songwriter and singer, a pretty good bass player, and a fairly mediocre keyboard player, guitar player, and drummer. What's fascinating and thrilling about his debut solo album is how much musical interest he is able to wring out of his limited abilities as an instrumentalist. Aside from his lovely and fluid bass lines, the instrumental parts on all these songs are quite simple, but McCartney is so intensely musical he manages to make it all work. The album is light, intimate and personal, and fairly bursts with warmth and feeling.

B000091KVL|4.0|Indie-rock band At the Drive In shattered just as they were starting to make it big. But from the ashes of At The Drive-In came: The Mars Volta. And their full-length debut album, \\"De-Loused At The Comatorium,\\" is a rousing, blasting, strange and magnificent lump of space rock.<br /><br />\\"Son Et Lumiere\\" is a melodic buildup to the fireball of \\"Inertiatic ESP,\\" the eerie string-driven \\"Tira Me A Las Aranas,\\" the haunting drum-laden \\"Drunkship of Lanterns\\" with its lamenting howls, the rollicking \\"Eriatarka,\\" the slightly overlong but very compelling \\"Cicatriz ESP,\\" the chaotic \\"This Apparatus Must Be Unearthed,\\" the soft and melodic \\"Televators,\\" and the At the Drive-In-influenced \\"Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt.\\"<br /><br />It's rather rare to have a concept album now. But this full-length debut definitely is one. It tells of a Mexican artist who committed suicide in the 1990s. Here, he falls into a coma and lingers in the world of \\"De-Loused\\" for a week. (It sounds depressing, but it isn't) The plaintive, surreal songs make a lot more sense once you know the story.<br /><br />\\"De-Loused\\"'s sound is hard to classify: a combo of rock, psychedelica, a hint of jazz, Latin music, and a few others that are hard to identify. For that matter, it's not really much like several songs, as a single song that bobs into different musical genres. Often the songs will melt into one another, one barely pausing as it dies away before the next melody starts. It gives \\"De-Loused\\" the feeling of a big, glorious tapestry.<br /><br />The lyrics and music reflect this feel; the lyrics are wrenchingly weird (\\"Nobody is heard/compass wilting in the wind!\\"), with an undeniably powerful melancholy, dark edge. It's never more evident than in the despairing wail of \\"Now I'm lost!\\". The music can switch from shattering guitar riffs to delicate instrumentals tinged with a synthesizer. And though at times they sound chaotic as a thunderstorm storm, it's obvious that they know what they're doing.<br /><br />Mars Volta is a blast of explosive new rock music that blows away the rubbish. \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\" is like stepping through a door into a world where the normal rules of music don't apply.

0060930349|5.0|Paul Johnson's book makes all of American history entertaining and interesting for the general, if open-minded, reader. There are two prominent Amazon reviewer comments that I disagree with: <br /> <br />1. The Suggestion that we should ignore the post-1960 material <br />I agree that after 1960, Johnson's description of events appears to be largely sympathetic to Nixon and an aggressive attack on Kennedy. This is not necessarily due to a change in Johnson's analysis as it is the familiarity of the readers with the subject. We have to stop expecting American history to be something not to be questioned. Johnson had every right (and obligation) to argue against affirmative action, for example, as much as he had the right to refute the popular understanding of the riots in New York during the Civil War. \\"Objectivity\\" is an impossible standard in history; instead Johnson gives us his conclusions and judgements with the reasons he has for making those judgements. <br /> <br />2. The \\"anecdotal history\\" comment <br />This history is anything but a collection of anecdotes. Johnson includes many stories to give us an understanding of the personalities of historical figures, but this book is packed with facts and numbers, fully referenced. \\"Anecdotal\\" history would be what most Americans had to sit through in high school. Not so with Johnson's book. <br /> <br />I don't give this book 5 Stars for being perfect. It is not perfect. Many episodes of American history are lightly covered and in my opinion under-represented. That is why one should find other books (e.g. Max Boot's book on small wars, Eric Schlosser's book on fast food) that do an excellent job filling our understanding of how America in its present form came to be. But I believe Johnson's book to be the best of its kind, by quite a margin.
1401301010|5.0|Wow,this book really blew me away.It was intriguing,funny and painfully sad.I have always been a fan of the genius that is anthony kiedis, but this book showed there is so much more to him than the amazing voice and god like stage presence. <br />It starts at anthonys independent childhood, and takes you on a rock and roll, drug fuelled journey through his music,relationships and personal demons. <br />This is a must read and the essential chilli's bible.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|Like most reviewers here it seems, I was questionnable about my reaction to the movie, but heck, I was in the mood for some pure entertainment. At first, I was agreeing with the critics in that the movie was slow going, but passed the first 30 minutes, I was into the setting, characters, and plot.Knowing how it ends ahead of time is always a drag, but this time I was genuinely upset because I had really gotten into it. It was the Achilles/Bresias romance that did it. Peter O'Toole plays a very convincing king Priam, and Pitt was believable as Achilles. Brian Cox's Agamemnon seemed a bit too gung-ho tooting at times, but it is needed in order to believe why not only does Achilles call him a \\"sack of wine\\" but also the pure greed he has to be the sole ruler of all the Greek lands. All in all, I was pleasantly surprised, so if you're in the mood to be entertained and have a good story behind it(albeit not fully accurate)then rent it. Like one of those 1950 epic films but modernized.
B0006A9FMI|3.0|I thought that Ghost in the Shell 2: Innocence was an excelent follow up to the 1996 original masterpeice. The animation was just breathtaking to watch. And seeing Batou in his \\"own\\" movie was a nice touch for the series. Even though this is an excelent film. The poor dvd features done by none other than \\"Dreamworks\\" is not worthy of a film such as this. Sence they went ahead and dubbed Ghost in the Shell: Stand Alone Complex. They should have got the same people to dub the movie as well. I honestly hate reading subtitles while trying to watch a movie. It is a pain to try and read the entire scrip while keeping up with what is going on above the words. Anyways I encourage all who are fimiliar with the series to rent this movie. It is well worth the money to rent. Or you have the option to wait until \\"Dreamworks\\" fixes their mistakes and puts the film out for real.....Bottom line great movie just don't buy it like I did. Rent it and hope that a certain studio (DREAMWORKS) will learn from their mistakes and fix their problem.
0739306529|1.0|Giving it the benefit of the doubt, I'm only reviewing the abridged audiobook, leaving the possibility that the abridger cut out everything interesting.  I have compiled a list of literary elements that might make this book a little better, so here it is: <br /> <br />1.  A plot <br /> <br />Yeah, that's what we need.  The supremely uninteresting character development almost exclusively takes up the first 2/3 of the book, making it slower moving than, say, Ethan Frome.
0446677450|2.0|I thought that this was a very interesting book but because it was not the normal type of book i read it was somewhat slow and not that entertaining for me.  Besides that the information givin in this book was entresting as well as useful in everyones own life which i though were very intersting.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|What can I say about this film? This film is a truly laugh out loud sensation that'll leave you begging for more. The film is starts out with these young college freshman that are trying to get sworn in at a local fraternity, but they end up in all kinds of misadventures along the way together. Although the film is a bit ridiculous at times, it never stops being funny. With great scenes like the Toga party, the infamous trial scene, or even the famous revenge scheme at the end, you'll never stop laughing. When I first saw this movie, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen and laughed the whole night away. Overall, this is one of the greatest comedies I've ever seen.<br /><br />As for the DVD, you can fast forward through the advertisements at the beginning of the disc.
B00005JNEW|4.0|This film ended up be much better than I thought. The story centers around a Texas high school football team and their hopes for a state championship win. Trouble ensues when star player Boobie (how'd he get that name?) injures his leg. Pretty good performances and scary to think that people can get so carried away with a game that it rules their lives. Then again, this is Texas so what else do they have to do with themselves?
0744596262|5.0|My best friend, a teacher, gave me this book as a shower gift and stated it was her children's favorite book.  I started reading to my son at 3 months and found it hard to keep his attention (go figure) until I picked up this book.  It has been his absolute favorite from the beginning.  I never would have imagined a baby so young having preferences, but he absolutely did.  He could be crying, I would pull out this book and start reading, and he would immediately calm down.  If I switched to another book, the fussing would again begin.  He is now 6 months old and I believe it was because of this book that he looks forward to story time every night.  We are up to 5 board books a night, and always end with Owl Babies.  The best part for me - it is beautifully drawn and is a sweet, well told story that does not make you feel like pulling your hair out because you have to read it again (and again, and again!)
B00009RDG9|1.0|The Hunted (William Friedkin, 2003)<br /><br />You're never sure what you're going to get with William Friedkin. You could get Cruising, or The Exorcist, or his remake of 12 Angry Men. Or, you could end up with Jade, The Guardian, or The Hunted. Yes, The Hunted definitely gets tossed on the pile of \\"films William Friedkin will disown later in life.\\" If anyone else involved with the movie wants to be remembered fondly by the masses, they, too, will disown it.<br /><br />It's painful to watch Hollywood in action sometimes. The trailers for The Hunted made it seem like ninety minutes of Tommy Lee Jones chasing Benicio del Toro through the woods. That might well have made for a good movie. Instead, we get about five minutes of Tommy Lee Jones chasing Benicio del Toro through the woods, a bunch of minutes of him chasing Benicio del Toro through other places, and a whole lot of backstory, subplot, and exposition that is entirely unnecessary to the film.<br /><br />The basic plot (what the film should have been in its entirety) is that Aaron Hallam (del Toro), a very nasty government military type, has gone renegade after losing his mind during an assignment. He has become paranoid, and believes the government is now hunting him. (Whether he is correct is never truly exposed, one of the few plot elements where the film does refuse to capitulate to \\"we need this in a Hollywood movie.\\") The government brings in L. T. Bonham (Jones), a tracker for the Canadian forestry service who used to work for the government training people to become very nasty government military types. You can see where this is going.<br /><br />Obviously, you've got a rehash of David Morrell's fine novel (and, with the exception of the final five minutes, Ted Kocheff's equally fine film) First Blood, with del Toro as John Rambo and Jones as Col. Trautman. The trailers made this look like a different, and intriguing, take on the same material, with nothing but the two main characters hunting one another through the woods. But Hollywood doesn't like to do two-character movies, despite the breathtaking success of some memorable examples of the subgenre in the past (Closetland and My Dinner with Andre being the obvious examples). So somehow, somewhere, someone decided that Aaron Hallam needed a makeshift family, there needed to be a whole bunch of FBI agents, etc., and the movie ends up being more about the other stuff than about Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio del Toro chasing each other through the woods. Worse, when the obviouis showdown finally does occur, any semblance of realism the movie might have had goes flying out the window; it's the Grizzly Adams version of the scene where neither six-shooter ever runs out of bullets. Thoroughly stupid, and the movie gets knocked down half a point solely for its last ten minutes.<br /><br />There are many, many better films in William Friedkin's oeuvre. Do yourself a favor and watch those instead. * ½ne another through the woods.

B00049QP74|4.0|First off, the only reason this package gets four stars instead of five is the fact that the DVD accompanying it is a real con job!!<br /><br />The video's anamorphic widescreen and the sound is Dolby stereo, but we only get interview snippets with Mark and his new band that run for about 30 minutes. Oh sure, there is terrific footage of them playing and recording live in the studio (including an unreleased track called \\"Summer Of Love\\") but none of the songs are complete!!<br /><br />The album itself is great, stuck in the same groove as \\"Sailing To Philedelphia\\" (which isn't a bad thing) and features great songwriting as usual - just check out the lyrics for \\"Boom Like That\\", \\"Trawlerman's Song\\" and \\"Whoop De Doo\\".<br /><br />The playing is laidback and intense, and Mark does get in a few of his trademark licks. Recommended.
B000294SFW|4.0|Inferno rocks, plain and simple. I had stopped listening to Motorhead for awhile because I thought they phoned in a few of their releases in the 90's but this CD is  fast-paced heavy metal mayhem at its best. If your head doesn't feel like a bludgeoned melon after listening to Inferno, you don't have it turned up loud enough.
B00001MXXH|5.0|If you need to take a day off school and possibly get away with it, take notes from Ferris. He takes a day off, dogs best bud Cameron Frye into joining him and girlfriend Sloane Peterson, using the dead grandma excuse. They use Cam's dad's 1961 Ferrari, which his dad likes more than his family. However, Ferris' sister Jeannie doesn't buy it, and his principal Ed Rooney chases him like a hungry hound dog; Bueller is one absence away from repeating his senior year, so Rooney would like to have that happen. Meanwhile, the trio joyrides all over Chicago in the priceless car, eating at expensive restaurants, seeing priceless art, attending Cubs games, and the finisher: Ferris sings two classic 60s songs in a parade in front of thousands. Later, Cameron wrecks the Ferrari and is slowly gaining self esteem. Then Ferris is almost exposed by Rooney, but his sister bails him out, of all people. The lesson in this movie, as Ferris puts it: Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop to look around once in a while, you could miss it.
6304712499|5.0|I caught this in the theaters back in '97 and have enjoyed it ever since. John Leguizamo as Clown really steals the show! His humor and jokes are so twisted and gross that you just can't help but laugh. Unfortuately, Simmons/Spawn ends up playing second fiddle to him.<br /><br />This film gets a bad rep, but it was much better than that other comic book film of summer 97 (Batman & Robin).<br /><br />Again, Clown's humor is not for the weak stomached. Such as when he breaks wind and says, \\"Oops, that was a wet one.\\" Then pulls his undies off to reveal the skid marks as evidence.
B000002UQJ|4.0|Paul McCartney's follow-up album to 1989's \\"Flowers in the Dirt\\" has shamefully been overlooked over the years. I would call it Paul's last great and relevant album (sorry, but the later albums just didn't cut it for me anymore).<br /><br />\\"Off the Ground\\" (12 tracks, 50 min.) starts off with the rocking title track, followed by the biting \\"Looking for Change\\", an anti-animal-abuse song surely inspired by Linda. Then follows the delicious single \\"Hope for Deliverance\\", reminiscent of 1978's \\"Deliver Your Children\\". The album contains 2 tracks Macca co-wrote with Elvis Costello, and they are standouts: \\"Mistress and Maid\\" and \\"The Lovers That Never Were\\". Anther great track is the epic \\"C'Mon People\\" (another single, 7+ min, reminiscent of \\"Hey Jude\\"). What keeps this album from getting more than 4 stars are a couple of duds like \\"Biker Like an Icon\\" and the preachy \\"Peace in the Neighborhood\\" (another single).<br /><br />Following the release of \\"Off the Ground\\", a big commercial succes (the last one, really) for Paul, he set off on a world tour that was documented in the \\"Paul is Live\\" CD, only necessary for Paul-completists (count me as one). Meanwhile, \\"Off the Ground\\" is a great album, sadly overlooked in the Macca catalogue.
B000068FY1|5.0|1992's \\"Hollywood Town Hall\\" is an alt-rock classic.  Every song on this album is a gem.  Technically the Jayhawks' third album (after their eponymous debut, also known as the \\"Bunkhouse Album,\\" [1986] and \\"Blue Earth\\" [1989]), HTH is the culmination of the band's early sound.  Olson and Louris weren't fighting yet-- they were still having fun making their guitars jangle and their fuzz boxes buzz.  (Think Roger McGuinn meets the Jesus and Mary Chain... on ecstacy...)  And their vocal harmonies are just plain gorgeous.  The lyrics are poetic and obscure, always a tad wistful, but the music is clear and bright-- in short, this is why the early-mid-90's alt-country movement has sometimes been called \\"no depression.\\"  They keep the earthy, folky roots of the music intact, but add gritty rock and honeyed pop overtones for a sound that's both familiar and new.  (Well, that just sounds pretentious... but it's true!)  Anyway, HTH's sound and mood are so consistent and seamless that it's hard to choose standout tracks, but my favorites are \\"Waiting for the Sun,\\" \\"Crowded in the Wings,\\" \\"Take Me With You (When You Go),\\" \\"Settled Down Like Rain,\\" \\"Nevada, California,\\" and \\"Martin's Song.\\" <br /> <br />[Historical note: the term \\"no depression\\" was probably first applied to alt-country in homage to the 1990 Uncle Tupelo album of that name, which was, in turn, a tip o' the hat to the Carter Family's depression era song, \\"No Depression in Heaven.\\"]
B00003CXI1|3.0|On its Disney Channel premiere last Friday, I only watched the opening studio logo and the opening shot at Privet Drive. Then I turned on the news instead--and that was it. (The same thing happened whenever HBO had it.) <br /> <br />Everything in the Potter franchise is so full of witchcraft that it is only enough for Christians like me to turn on something else. If morals are what you're looking for when it comes to good family entertainment, then please settle down with Care Bears, Lord of the Rings or Finding Nemo wherever you can find them! <br /> <br />I didn't even bother watching the Chamber of Secrets--and hence, nor will I watch Azkaban, nor read any of the Rowling books in my lifetime again. <br /> <br />***/5 stars
1591396190|5.0|In ''Blue Ocean Strategy\\", Rene Mauborgne and W. Chan Kim, professors of strategy and management at the INSEAD business school in France offer business leaders a blueprint for creating uncontested market space and making the competition irrelevant.  This book, based on extensive research by the professors, offers important and fresh insights into business strategy that challenges the widely accepted wisdom of competitive advantage and competitive benchmarking.  <br /> <br />In this significant book, Kim and Mauborgne clearly articulate the theory of \\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" and elegantly bring the theory to life with entertaining and educational examples.  These examples show how companies in mature and unattractive industries have created new market space by following what the professors refer to as \\"value innovation\\" strategies.   <br /> <br />In contrast to competion-based red ocean strategies, value innovation blue ocean strategies are created through the actions and beliefs of business leaders who do not accept the existing boundaries of their markets and industries.  Kim and Mauborgne show how companies within existing industries have created new market space by reconstructing their market boundaries and going beyond competing according to the traditional rules of their industries.  These strategies have resulted in the creation of new untapped demand and profitable growth that have reached beyond existing customers and have turned non-customers into customers. <br /> <br />While competition-based red ocean strategies see either differentiation or low cost as a strategic choice, companies following the logic of blue ocean strategy seek to break the value-cost trade-off by pursuing differentiation and low-cost simultaneously.  This is just one of several key insights developed in this book. <br /> <br />Up to this point, it has been taken for granted that creating new growth strategies was risky, left to entrepreneurs, and serendipitous. Kim and Mauborgne show that this need not be the case.  Through their 15 years of research spanning over 100 years of business, Kim and Mauborgne have succeeded in formulating a comprehensive and systematic set of analytical frameworks to guide management teams in discovering new blue oceans while simultaneously reducing the risk that is typically assumed with growth.   <br /> <br />Kim and Mauborgne articulate six principles for creating blue oceans, explain an associated framework to support implementation of each principle, and demonstrate how each principle will help business leaders to minimize each specific risk factor that is typically encountered during growth strategy formulation and execution efforts. <br /> <br />\\"Blue Ocean Strategy\\" is a must read for all business leaders who are responsible for charting their companies' future.  It will provide a roadmap to help business leaders guide their teams to discover strategic options which create new blue oceans by aggregating the largest possible mass of buyers for their ideas.  Additionally the principles in this book will help business leaders to think through how to sequence their strategic moves, tune their business models and engage their organizations in the blue ocean strategy process so that they can not only create new ideas, but more importantly realize healthy profits from them. <br /> <br />Ralph G.

B0000524CY|5.0|The Exorcist succeeds on every level. This film should have swept the Oscars. The acting, and direction was beyond top rate, William Freidkin coaxed masterful performances from all of his actors. It works because we believe in Regan and her actress mom, they are real people like us, as is Father Karras and everyone else involved. We are seeing ourselves on the big screen. What happens to these people is the most terrifying thing that can happen to anyone, especially parents. What do you do when your kid is losing her sanity? You start to question yours as your world slowly falls apart, and no one can help, especially not doctors and head shrinks. But demonic possession? Is it real? Who really knows. But Regan's mother is desperate for any solution. And then the film begins to terrorize, to turn into the darkest nightmares. This film chilled audiences in the 70's to the bone, and I can see why. Freidkin uses subliminal images, and horrifying make up to tell a tale of demonic possession that strikes a raw nerve. Highly recommended.
1586210912|1.0|The book has some good ideas but they won't make you rich. It seems that the best thing to do is what author is doing: put many half truth - sweet sounding ideas together and sell them to people who want to get rich fast and easy (and that's everyone). <br /> <br />You want to do what author was doing: investing in small companies stocks? Good luck.  <br />He may have made good mony in buying foreclousers when no one was doing that. But you try it now when millions are probably trying to do the same thing. Good luck again. <br /> <br />What author is doing is selling you ideas that used to work for him some times ago, but not anymore. <br /> <br />Author is saying: don't work, don't run your business. Own business and let other people work. I agree that it sounds great. But is this reality. <br /> <br />Why didn't Kiyosaki retire already?  <br />
B00000DQLL|4.0|The 1993 \\"Off the Ground\\" album gave Macca his last true international success. It spawned 4 singles, this being the second of them.<br /><br />\\"Off the Ground\\" (5 tracks, 19 min.) starts off with the rocking title track, just great. \\"Cosmically Conscious\\" is excerpted on the album as the fade-out but featured here in its full version, and a great song. \\"Style Style\\" is an above-par mid-tempo rocker, and could have easily fitted onto the flow of the album. \\"Sweet Sweet Memories\\" features great vocal harmonies, another great B-side. \\"Soggy Noodle\\" is a short guitar instrumental, and unnecessary, frankly.<br /><br />In all, though, this is a great single, and a necessary addition to any Paul McCartney completist.
B000068FUM|5.0|To say that \\"Tomorrow the Green Grass\\" is not as great as the Jayhawks' classic \\"Hollywood Town Hall\\" is not so much a criticism of this album as it is a compliment to HTH.  \\"Tomorrow the Green Grass\\" is an excellent album in it's own right.  It represents the band's move from the alt-country/\\"no depression\\" sound of their 1st three albums to a more straight ahead rock sound, but still hinges on the gorgeous vocal harmonies and poetic lyrics of Mark Olson and Gary Louris.  The addition of keyboardist Karen Grotberg gives depth to the more lush production without completely overpowering the jangle & fuzz guitar sound that made their earlier work so much fun to listen to.  Stand out gems are the album's opening and closing tracks (\\"Blue\\" and \\"Ten Little Kids,\\" respectively.)  This would be Olson's last album with the band, but what a way to go...

B00028HBKM|5.0|A violent depiction of the last hours of Jesus Christ, \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is a monumentally daring move by director Mel Gibson, who used his own money to finance this decidedly non-Hollywood-type film.   <br /> <br />It is clear that Gibson has made a film that emerges from his own religious convictions, that Christ suffered and died to save all humankind from sin.  Thus, those who understand the theological message will not be so much offended by the violence as moved to greater spiritual awareness.  Those who do not understand the message or simply do not agree with it will see nothing but senseless, meaningless, unrelenting violence. <br /> <br />It has been funny to see Hollywood scratching its head, wondering how such a film (in Aramaic and Latin, no less!)could become the 9th most popular film of all time.  They just don't get it.  They don't understand that there are many people, millions of people, who are starving for religious content in films. <br /> <br />There is an audience out there that wishes to see films of a religious nature.  Mel Gibson has taken his own religious beliefs and committed them to film.  Quite obviously, the nation and the world have taken this film to heart.
B00028HBKM|1.0|It would be impossible for someone to go through what the character named Jesus went through in that movie.  In order for someone to die then be ressurected a few days later they would have to be a god or something, and we all know gods do not exist. <br /> <br />The illogical fallacies in this movie are far surpassed by the utter boredom that I received from watching some dude get whipped, beaten and tortured for a good 3 hours.  The movie did not explain anything, or even tell a story for that matter.  The Passion of Christ was basically an extremely long sentence fragment that tried to explain the hardships that the fictional character Jesus went through because he opposed the government by pretending to be a magical god. <br /> <br />Scientific evidence proves that humans cannot do many of the things that Jesus did, unless of course they use magic.  And not this higher-power all-mighty magic, but a more realistic Lance Burton magic that involves slight of hand and exploiting a people's weakness for needing a reason for why everything exists.  I gave this movie 1 star because it claims to be a non-fictional account of the life of Jesus when it is obviously not.  It was a horribly told story that involved a lot of unnecessary violence.
0399230033|5.0|Well...I guess you can debate over whether you want to read a book to your little ones where the main character essentially sneaks out of bed and plays mischieviously about, but please take your chances with this delightfully funny and charming books.<br /><br />The Night watchman at the zoo has just told the gorilla goodnight and turns his back only to have the gorilla pick the keys to his cage from his pocket.  Sneaking around, the Gorilla uses the keys to open up the cages of other animals.  They form a parade behind the unwitting watchman, even following him home and into bed for the night until the watchman's wife notices and leads the animals back to their rightful beds for the night.<br /><br />Kids will laugh as the gorilla and other animals sneak around right behind the watchman's back.  Peggy Rathman's funny, cartoon-like illustrations are the perfect complement to her text.  This one has quickly become a new favorite in our household with my two year old.
B000001EGA|5.0|Once in a great while, a truly classic album is overlooked both by critics and fans. Upon its release in 1975, \\"Captain Fantastic\\" recieved a somewhat less enthusiastic response than its predecessors, effectively ending a string of hit albums that had begun with the second, self-titled, album in 1970. Thirty years later, it is difficult to see why this magnificent record has never been accorded the respect it so richly deserves. An autobiographical concept album that recounts Elton and Bernie's attempts in the late 1960s to break into the music business, it is a stone jem from start to finish, containing many of the duo's most evocative and memorable songs. Listen to any track, at random, and feel the magic! This is truly an unjustly-igored masterpiece. My personal favorite on an album brimming with brilliance is the ashonishing title track, which virtually defines the \\"surrealistic cowboy song\\" genre.
B00005KFUM|5.0|Ahh Muse. Chances are, you've just seen that Muse has put out a few albums prior to Absolution. This one wasn't even released in the US and in fact caused the band to switch labels. And it's probably good, as Absolution might not have ever been made.  <br /> <br />Origin of Symmetry is the album that showed every critic that wanted to compare Muse to Radiohead that they were wrong. While Showbiz has it's relative similarities, OOS is nothing of the sort. From the first track, a lethal but beautiful combination of classic piano, heavy rock, smooth falsettos and deep lyrics, the album doesn't let up. Each track keeps attacking from a different position. The constant barrage of fused sound is what makes this album so great. true, the changeover from album to live sound is harder to recreate with the songs found on this album, as they were produced more heavily than the other two albums. This album really shows how fast the band progressed from Showbiz to this and then on to Absolution. While it may not have been the commercial success that Absolution is seeing, OOS is probably just as good. It's impossible to compare the two as their general sounds are derived from different themes, OOS's being spacey and futuristic and Absolutions' being very apocalyptic.  <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album to everyone. It's already becomming a cult classic, make it part of your collection.
0446677450|3.0|\\"Rich Dad, Poor Dad\\" contains some valuable insights into wealth management, but nothing revolutionary enough to mitigate Kiyosaki's simplistic writing style, long-windedness and tiresome cliches. <br /> <br />This book focuses on three kernels of wisdom: don't live beyond your means, don't spend frivolously, and learn the difference between income-generating assets and income-draining liabilities. These notions are common sense to most of us, and they're certainly not going to make anyone rich overnight. They're useful lessons if you're suffering from bad spending habits and need to turn your finances around. Otherwise, they're nothing your typical reader hasn't heard before. <br /> <br />The repeated allegory about Kiyosaki's Rich Dad and Poor Dad grows tiresome quickly, and serves as little more than a sales gimmick. Once again -- this is a useful technique if you need such a story to make sense of Kiyosaki's lessons. If you read at anything greater than a third-grade level, however, you will find the Rich Dad / Poor Dad stories insulting to your intelligence. <br /> <br />While most of the book is mildly useful, Kiyosaki touches upon one potentially dangerous suggestion: that people should invest in real estate as a means of attaining financial freedom. Real estate is a risky game, and I imagine that many of Kiyosaki's target readers lack the means to invest in it in the first place. REITs are a much safer bet than apartment buildings, and fortunately, Kiyosaki pays lip service to them. <br /> <br />Ironically enough, this book is probably more useful for kids already born rich -- who need to learn how to manage their wealth sensibly. But it's probably not going to make millionaires out of people not born into millions.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|I have listened all the way through only once so this review is based on my initial impressions.  As you may know, The Way Up consists of one track, 68 minutes long and broken up into 4 sections.  While for the most part it seems to be on familiar ground melodically and harmonically, it is a complex, layered piece whose compositional form challenges the listener.  On this CD, PMG are stretching the bounds of song structure and compositional organization in a Jazz setting.  I suspect that the shorter length of the Opening, which clocks at about five minutes, is a small concession to Jazz and Smooth Jazz radio stations, who mostly cater to listeners with shorter attention spans.  Within this expanded compositional setting, Metheny and Lyle Mays have written their most exciting and original music since Metheny's 1992 solo album &#34;Secret Story.&#34; At times densely layered, with much greater use of overdubs than on previous albums, the different sections flow into one another like a musical stream of consciousness, at times somewhat reminiscent of the work of fellow Nonesuch artist John Adams.  It's probably not coincidental that now that PMG is on the Nonesuch label, they feel the freedom to work in more complex and interesting song structures.  Metheny's and Lyle Mays' playing is varied and compelling, much more so than on the last two or three PMG CD's, which were very enjoyable, but which were so well crafted that to me they lost some spontaneity (I'm sure many would disagree.) The &#34;Speaking Of Now&#34; DVD, was much better, with new arrangements of several PMG &#34;standards&#34; and great musicianship.  Joining PMG again on this CD is the wonderfully expressive trumpeter Cuong Vu, whose solos evoke Miles Davis but still have an original voice and new member Gregoire Maret, who is described as a &#34;harmonica virtuoso&#34; on the PMG site. Maret has at least one beautiful solo, but at times it was hard to discern whether I was hearing harmonica or guitar synth or keyboard.  I'm sure future listens will make that clear.  This is definitely a CD that will require repeated listening to fully grasp the enormity of their accomplishment.  This CD will probably leave behind the Smooth Jazz listener who is not used to longer and more complex compositions, which I suspect is one of the things that PMG intended.  For those willing to dive in and give it their full attention, The Way Up is an enormously rewarding experience that ranks up there with the best of Metheny and PMG's other recordings.
0399226907|5.0|The Very Hungry Caterpillar is simply a classic of childrens literature because it does so many things in one little book.  It teaches children about counting as the caterpillar slowly eats his way through multitudes of different foods.  It teaches the days of the week, as each day passes and the caterpillar eats more and more...It can teach colors as each food is easily identified by it's colors such as the bright red apple.  And it even teaches some beginning science as we see the caterpillar hatch from an egg...then build his cocoon, and emerge a beautiful little butterfly.<br /><br />Carle spins this tale in a manner so easy for pre-K kids to understand and follow along with perfectly simple and colorful illustrations to complement the text.  This book is one of my 2 year olds true favorites to read at story time.  It's been around for quite awhile but this book is always a winner.  All of Carle's books are highly recommended!
B00005JLEX|5.0|I laughed when I read the 1 star reviews of these shows. People saying that there was no real plots, no characters that they could \\"love\\" and no punchline. I laughed because that is EXACTLY the point of this very clever comedy. You therefore, I repectfully say, have missed the point by miles. <br /> <br />This comedy is very deep, very very flawed characters, two or three story strands per episode, very clever and funny observational humour and NEVER a happy ending. Making it funny and original, especially compared with the conveyer belt apple-pie twee non-humour comedies that get churned out every week onto our televisions.  <br /> <br />If the 1 star people want cuddly characters and domestic humour, then I Love Lucy and The Cosby Show are all still running. Me, I prefer this cutting edge humour of now. People mention Mash, but Mash (brilliant) was very much cutting edge and of its time in the same way. <br /> <br />Ignore the people who dont get it. You americans should be very proud of producing this type of comedy. Its universal and brilliant! <br />
B000067UUJ|5.0|This soundtrack to Muse's dvd Hullabaloo, is a must have. The double disc features b-sides on one disc and a live performance from Le Zenith in Paris on the other.  <br /> <br />First disc one. This disc contains a helping of b-sides that are worthy enough to see the light of day. They all sound very different from song to song, but seeing as it's a compilation, it really doesn't matter. I personally like all the songs, but I like Muse, so it's a given really. <br /> <br />Secondly disc two. For being a compilation of two shows into one disc, there is very seamless transitions from one song to the next. As far as a live cd, the quality it excellent. It's professionally recorded, so it isn't bothered by lots of background noises and overbearing crowds. It's not quite as good as seeing them live, but it does capture the overall sound very nicely. <br /> <br />Overall, I would recommend this album to anyone who wants to delve deeper into Muse and their music.
067144901X|5.0|This is one of the books our 18-month-old turns to again and again, and she has a pretty big variety from which to choose.  A parent with any ability to mimic animal sounds will soon become the last word in entertainment in his/her child's eyes, thanks to this book.
B0006M4SO6|2.0|I know I'll be slated for saying this, and I'll never again receive any free concert posters from Ted Kurland Associates, but this album is sheer confectionery -- another concoction of Metheny sweetmeats with no soul.  For those of us who've been following the Metheny-Mays combo since the 1970s, it is depressing that they have come up with something that is better labelled as '70s progressive rock' than 'jazz'-anything.  This has as many pointless changes of key, pace and tone as anything put out by Yes, Gentle Giant or Hatfield and the North.  This is Metheny's 'Topographic Oceans', not his 'Kind of Blue'.<br /><br />There comes a point in the life of many a successful musician where family becomes more important than the music.  Suddenly you find you're living half a continent away from your main collaborator and, despite the connectivity of the Internet, you've lost that creative spark.  Making music becomes a job rather than the passionate fulfilment of a dream.  The more I think about, the more I feel this happened for Metheny in the late 1980s, around the time he switched from ECM to Geffen.<br /><br />Certainly the switch from Geffen to Nonesuch seems to have achieved no change in direction.  (They're both Warner subsidiaries, aren't they?)  Like most of the Geffen albums, THE WAY UP (68:10) contains a bit of something for everyone.  Even the cover design is the multi-coloured pot-pourri that characterised the Geffen years.  (With ECM, you tend to get a much more focussed album cover, with a harsh Nordic simplicity.  Some would say the 'chamber-jazz' recording style of ECM is also preferable to this heavily layered symphony.)<br /><br />I am part of the loyal fan base, in that I dutifully buy the albums and go to the concerts when they visit our area.  But I just feel the guys could achieve so much more -- possibly by making it much simpler.  Perhaps it's time for another Metheny-Mays duo album.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Gibson's Passion portrays the suffering of Christ as well as I could imagine it being done in a film.  His goal is to show the audience what Christ endured on our behalf, and I think he has done it.<br /><br />The torture, bloodshed and cruelty are shocking and offensive, but that is the way it happened.  This is what Christ experienced in the final hours of his suffering on earth.  The mocking of the Romans, the accusations of the Jewish leaders, the conflicts of his disciples, and the love for Jesus by the mass of people are all portrayed.<br /><br />The effects of flashbacks during the film to Jesus as a boy, young man, and times with his disciples emphasize his humanness and relationships.  The focus on Mary and her love for her son is gripping as we are forced to consider that Jesus is her child whom she has cared for.<br /><br />We see the anguish Christ faces when in the garden contemplating the suffering ahead of him.  Satan is present there and throughout the film to tempt and ridicule Jesus.  All of the time, Jesus keeps his eyes on his Father and the mission he is accomplishing for all people.<br /><br />The film makes it apparent that at anytime Christ could have ended it all my calling on God for angels or my using his power to stop it.  As we see in the garden, even as he is being arrested he heals the soldiers ear.  Although there were several players involved, we see that no person caused Christ death, but he gave his own life.<br /><br />The fact that the language is aramaic and latin is not bothersome at all and I think it adds to the profundity of the words spoken.<br /><br />I can't imagine this movie being done better that it has been done.  It completely fulfills the goals set for it: to display the suffering of Christ and the love in his heart.
B0006M4SO6|5.0|Amazing from top to bottom. As a long time avid fan of this group, I cannot name one of their amazazing achievments that even approaches this one. They've literally taken each period of the Pat Metheny Group's history and woven them into one of the most awe-inspiring musical experiences I will ever have. I'd go as far as to say that my sentiments will be echoed by 99 percent or more of those who experience this great work. Two hundred years from now there will be a chapter devoted to \\"The Way Up\\" in every music history book in print. Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Metheny/Mays. I'm speechless and amazed.....
B000002J1L|5.0|Make no mistake, this is an awesome album!  I got it for Christmas 2004 and absolutely love it.  Every song resonates with me.  I love The Musical Box, what a great start to the album, For Absent Friends is just a simple tune but one that shows the goodness of humanity and the simplicity of ordinary life.  Return of the Giant Hogweed is an interesting tale of weeds gone wild (reminds me of my back yard).  Seven stones is an awesome track, Harold the Barrel is funny, Harlequin is a good intermission before going on to my favorite track of the album, The Fountain of Salmacis.  I've only been listening to Genesis for the last 2 years or so, so I'm still building up my collection, but just when I think I've heard the best from Genesis, I pick up another cd and am amazed once again.  I waited on purchasing this cd because I wanted to give Foxtrot a whirl first.  This one was worth the wait for sure.  Alot has been said here about how good this album is, and I am echoing that sentiment.  If you have any doubts whether this would be a good Genesis purchase, have no fear, well worth the money.
B0002DB52M|3.0|3.5 stars.  The most noticable difference about this film as compared to most others is that the entire film is shot on one huge soundstage, chalk outlines on the ground showing where the walls of homes are and the names of each residence, making this feel like a PBS special with nudity and sexual situations.  It looks and feels like a play, with each character bringing specific attitudes and motivations.  The cast is actually exceptional, with many memorable performances giving way to unsettling scenes ranging from reluctant acceptance to taking unseemly liberties with Grace (Nicole Kidman) without any fear of repercussion from the rest of the townsfolk by way of an insane communal understanding.  Grace is a character who enters the town of Dogville on the run from gangsters for mysterious reasons and is convinced by the resident philosopher to try and fit in with the people until things have died down.  She agrees reluctantly, but as the film progresses she grows to appreciate small town life away from crime and her former life in the big city and is gradually accepted into the fold of the community.  Then things start to change as the residents begin to show their true colors, that human nature is the same no matter where you find it, and they start to take advantage of Grace's situation.  The requests start off small, then build and build until she is under the proverbial \\"thumb\\" of the town.  She fears and loathes returning to her fomer life so much that she submits to all sorts of humiliation until finally she is nearly an empty shell of a woman.  Without hope or fear left, people from her past come to Dogville to find her broken in spirit but now cast in iron and able to survive and do anything without fear.  There is a lot of philosophical depth to the piece, and to be honest this story would work much better on the stage than it does on film.  Within the first half hour of the film I was convinced that the title of my review was going to be \\"Snore.\\"  But asthe \\"chapters\\" are revealed, the metaphors become more evident, Dogville itself looks more and more like an asylum with only the rare individual being anywhere near sane.  Eventually, Grace is given the choice of becoming a part of the madness or creating her own.  There are many scenes near the end of the film which are very provocative, but early on this film is so unusual as to seem a chore to watch.  Once the characters are established and once the viewer gets used to the idea of watching a filmed play instead of a movie, only then does the story become interesting.  There are a couple of negatives that become grating at times.  One was the voice-over narration that pops in for explanations and/or direction for what characters are thinking or going to do.  I would rather the story showed the characters using dialogue and action to convey their motivations rather than having it all explained to me throughout the film.  The second thing I didn't like, and this goes for many films these days, is that I'm am getting sick of hand-held photography.  It looks amateurish, as if anybody could be filming, the camera shaking and completely unable to center an image.  This type of filming happened frequently enough for me to get a little exasperated.  \\"Enough!\\"  However, there is some interesting material here.  Is it enough to recommend the film?  Well, it really depends on how open-minded and cultured the viewers are.  If you enjoy a good play with strange characters and good acting in unusual situations, then yes, I recommend this film.  However, for the masses and anyone who pays for a DVD to see a film rather than a filmed play that may be too arty for the general public, then no, I would not recommend this DVD.  It all depends on the individual interested in the product.  The choice is yours.
0316172324|5.0|Whether one agrees about his underlying motives for writing two top-notch best-sellers or Not--You reviewers, please give this fellow, Malcolm GLADwell his due rewards. I am an Intuitive and  equally a Feeling and Thinking person. It seems he uses for his examples the works of a wide divergence of scientific study! For me his unique style soars with his Five Point Inventory and longest Chapter: \\"Paul Van Riper's Big Victory!\\"      This is especially true in \\"Perils of Introspection\\" followed by two Insight Puzzles. Becoming the assumed professor in, \\"Primed For Action\\" he describes a simple test to affect one's behavior! As Prison Chaplain, we sought ways to discover how we may affect Inmates' behavior while in prison. Later the author draws upon the Power of Imagination to picture the faces of Marilyn Monroe and Albert Einstein! Closely related is an appropriate story of Silvan Tompkins and Paul Ekman who became effective in reading the faces of Bill Clinton. They perceived him as Peck's Bad Boy, who wanted to be caught with his hand in the cookie-jar.     Ironically they were right! This is one \\"layered story\\" as Fred  Craddock, tops in his field of Preaching, teaches his Theology  students about Parables. Chapter 5 \\"Kenna's Dilemma\\" gets unique stories on taking \\"A Second Look at First Impressions.\\" Added to President Clinton, we see the inside of Coca-Cola's contest with Pepsi, the testing of new products from Christian Brothers  in, \\"The Chair of Death,\\" in foods, Automobiles as Ford's Edsel and Columia records signing of Kenna to produce his recording of the \\"New Sacred Cow.\\"             Finally I came to his Conclusion: \\"Listening with your Eyes\\" and his involved story of the professional Trombonist, named Abbie Conant, I was really Hooked. Having scored with Bill Clinton and Dick Morris as the ideal political pollster, I looked at all of Gladwell's stories of reading person's faces and emotions in their responses-- Now I am convinced!       A \\"first impressionist\\" has enough going for my five stars and more. My accolades to my other reader friends! Hooray for this BLINK and his First THINK! Retired Chaplain (to those who cannot do Either) Fred W Hood
B000060MWU|3.0|As for the movie I think there has been enough said on it. As for the dvd quality it's another thing ... maybe some people might be interested by the low price ... even though it'S not always the case but in the case it is ... low price means low quality ... i see people seems to be talking about the sound but man the image is really bad ... ok not bad as you cannot see any detail or it's too dark or something ... no no on that side it's perfect. The only really negative point is that the image is sooooo pixelized ... probably due to it's fullscreen format.  As you all know I presume fullscreen is actually a stetch out version of widescreen in order to delete the infamous black bars ... In that case I think they stretch the image without adjusting it afterward ... when you stretch an image imperfections tend to get worst and a readjustement of the color level is require  ... too bad they didn't work on that ...
B00005B36H|5.0|From the first time I listened to this album, i knew it was the best ive heard.  The way Parabol runs into Parabola, when that guitar part kicks in, i knew this was an exceptional album.  Faaip de Oaid is one of the strangest/creepiest songs i have heard.  It just scared me to the point where i was not afraid of usual things anymore.  I love this album and everyone should hear it at least once.  Just hearing Maynard scream for almost half a minute is amazing along with the excellent drums, guitar, and bass.  All around great band with superb talent.
B00064MW6A|5.0|i really never listen to the crirtics, and thank god i didnt for catwoman. I actually thought this movie rocked. It was a really fun action filled movie. it's good to watch with some friends on a rainy day, most critics talked about all the special affects, come on man, what superhero movie is not gonna have special affects %80 of the time. ANYWAYS if your a movie fan, check the movie out, block out all the negative reviews and enjoy. You wont be dissapointed trust me.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|This movie is definetely at the top of my \\"funniest movies ever\\" list. The Humor of the movie might seem a bit different from the things we find funny because the film is from some other country. It is well worth $20, and is guaranteed to have you on the floor laughing. <br /> <br />A 5...out of 5
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I caught the first few episodes of Firefly when it was on TV, and while I enjoyed it, I didn't love it, in part because I am not a big Sci-fi or Western fan.  The premiere seemed so abrupt especially for the size of the cast that had to be introduced.  However, due to all of the excellent reviews, I decided to give Firefly a 2nd chance and bought the DVD. I quickly realized that the problem was that Fox is filled with a bunch of morons who tried to screw the series from the get go.  On TV, Fox played the 2nd episode first and played the series premiere last.  Smart Huh?  Fox then proceeded to show many of the other episodes completely out of order.  Once I got to watch the series in order, and could follow the character and plot developements, I absolutely loved the series.  Great writing, complex characters who you feel like you are just getting to know, and plenty of intrigue all make this series one of the best things to ever come to the small screen.  So even if you saw one or two of the episodes on TV, and wasn't impressed, I would suggest giving this series another try, it will blow you away.
0440237688|5.0|This is my absolute favorite book. I read it in fifth grade and bought the book with my own money. That would be the only book i've paid for. I cannot say enough good things about this book. When I began to read this book I was intrigued with the whole concept of a society where everything is uniform and controled. I thought the part about having houses for women to \\"produce\\" babies was interesting. I liked the idea about sharing your feelings of the day and any unorthadox dreams. I had no idea what was going on when he was tossing the apple with his friend. I just remember thinking it was so cool when he started being able to willingly see color. Another good thing about the Giver was the ending. I was definitely surprised when he ran away.
B000002GC2|5.0|I couldn't agree more with Rebecca's review.  <br /> <br />The Dude is a supremely sublime album, the production is flawless and of course features that smooth sound that Q is so famous for. Q and Bruce Swedien developed a process which they called \\"acusonic\\" and this is the process that gives us that silky tone that we also hear with all of Q's later work.  <br /> <br />Well, what about the songs, for me the best song on the entire album is Just Once, a song so powerfully moving that even now after some 24 years I feel my hairs stand on end. This was the album that gave us James Ingram and boy what a voice, One Hundred Ways as Rebecca pointed out is about the essence of true romance (the way it was meant to be, I guess), another beautiful song. Something Special is also superb with the wonderful Patti Austin. <br /> <br />The jazzier tunes, Razzamatazz, Ai No Corrida, Betch You Wouldn't Hurt Me (written by Stevie Wonder) are also top notch.  <br /> <br />I have played this album, first on Vinyl way back in 1981 maybe 200 times or more and I simply never tire of it.  <br /> <br />I guess another reason why this album means so much to me is that I was with someone very special at the time of it's release so I will always remember it by that too.  <br /> <br />I believe that this album was/is the most nominated in Grammy History. Bravo Q, for me this is best album from you.
B00005JLRT|2.0|As far as I am concerned, Star Trek the Next Generation went down with the Enterprise D in Star Trek: Generations.  This movie, like most of the TNG movies was simply thrown together showing off special effects and blowing things up.  As other reviewers have noted, all the other characters besides Data and Picard have been reduced to background people.  Worf has become comic relief and a wimp compared to the Klingon with the warrior's heart in the TV series.  Nothing is familiar on the enterprise (it's just a ship like any other that they move around in and shoot things with)   The Borg are too emotional and ordinary with the introduction of the Borg queen as opposed to the cold mechanical unstoppable juggernaut of the TV series.  Now in this movie we come to B-4 the recently discovered and previously unheard of android that just came out of nowhere (the romulans just happen to find him laying around some planet).  If I remember right, Dr. Soong (Data's inventor) only created two androids.  Data and Lore (the evil prototype).  I could have written this story much better.  When I saw the preview and it showed two Data type androids, I suspected and was excited by the idea that they reassembled Lore for some necessary reason.  And finally, we have a movie about the Romulans that isn't about the Romulans.  The story is just thrown together.  I give it two stars just because it's mildly entertaining and worth watching just for the action....the only thing worth while that relates to the series is that Troi and Riker get married.  But after Gene Roddenberry died, Trek just went downhill from there.
B000088E6D|5.0|Now this is how to make beautiful music!! <br />Seldom does a singer appeal to music lovers across the globe but Michael Buble is one who does. <br />I loved every track on this well produced album by David Foster.
079073639X|4.0|Whilst this  film is not exactly the best by any means, it does perform as a film much better than  the review  in the editorial would suggest. <br />The twists and  turns are fun, scarey, and filled with the edge of your seat paranoia that gives a great popcorn film its enjoyability. <br />Come to this film with no expectations, and you will enjoy it, I suspect. It's a good claustrophobic carpet-ride, with many twists, and some great mind games on a brilliantly done level. <br />
B000000WA4|5.0|i bought this cd expecting some serious and hard alternative rock, at least thats what my friends said.I was so happy when i had finished listening to the whole cd, because i just had discovered my newest and most favorite bands of all time. At that time i was like a little boy now i'm 14 and i still listen to ot daily. it is very versatile from screamed distorted songs to melanchole love ballads, some profanitible language for the parents, but overall my favorite album of all time. beautiful music harps an orchastra everything you could ask for on thie 5 times platinum double disk album. i love it you really ought to get it
B0006IIPIK|4.0|Film critic Richard Roeper actually gave this thumbs down. That's proof that he's a boring person. This movie is a lot of things and bad isn't one of them. It's unique, fun, exciting and original. It has a look of a 30's adventure pic which makes it different from other films these days. I wouldn't mind sequels but this film didn't exactly get the audience it deserved. So their probably won't be more movies and that's a shame.<br /><br />  Jude Law plays a pilot trying to save the world from giant robots. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his love interest who's a journalist. They both are well casted and even look like actors from the 30's in this. They have good chemestry too. Roeper knocked Angelina Jolie saying she's horrible as her daredevil pilot character. I've seen much worse performances though and she's not in the movie enough to ruin it in anyway even if she was bad in it.  Roeper knocks her a lot though. Guess she turned down a date with him or something lol. Roger Ebert was right though. This movie is about as exciting as watching Raiders of the Lost Ark for the first time. Although it does run out of just a little steam before it is over but...just a little.
B0002234LS|5.0|Could it get any better. Johnny Depp is gorgeous and it seems there isn't a role he can't play well. It's a typical stephen king story . . . with plenty of weirdness and at the end you're still wondering what happened, but it's definately a movie worth watching more than once.
0553802534|4.0|First off, not the book to be reading when you've got a bad bug and are feeling nauseous.  I threw up my Rice Crispies late this morning due to some graphic content colliding heads with my really off stomach. <br />  <br />If you've not read Gardner before, she's really worth it - on par with Lisa Scottoline, Kathy Reichs, Tami Hoag and - dare I say it? - Harlen Coben.  Her psychological thrillers have extremely rich characters, and rarely does she give you the pat \\"female victim\\" role.  Her women fight back, fight dirty, and sometimes spend the entire book making you wonder if they're the villain in the first place. <br />  <br />\\"Alone\\" is about a survivor.  Catherine was snatched by a pedophile when she was young, trapped in a dark hole in the ground, and abused for nearly a month.  She was found and rescued at random, but has never quite since gotten over her fear of the dark.  Years have passed - she has a child, a husband, a life, and now suddenly, things have gone wrong.  Bobby, a police SWAT sniper, responds to Catherine's call that her husband has a gun and is threatening the family.  In a split second decision, he shoots the husband to save the wife and child. <br />  <br />But things aren't at all as simple as they seem - and it might be that someone arranged all of it. <br />  <br />Solid thriller, with a mystery as tangled as you can ask for from an author that is very good at so far not growing at all stale with her plot ideas.  Even better was the cameo from a \\"The Perfect Husband\\" charater, which I always like: it lends a sense of continuity and realism to the tale when you bump into other wounded people still going on with their lives. <br />  <br />Long story short, go get it, read it, and you'll be just as wrapped up as I was.
B00005JN0T|4.0|The problem most people who told me it sucks seem to have is they expected it to be more like the book. Is a movie ever like the book? Didn't think so. So just sit down and watch a good movie, just don't over analyze it.
B00014K5TQ|5.0|I absolutely adore this film!  While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, I think this is a well put together interpretation of James St. James' novel \\"Disco Bloodbath.\\" If you haven't read the book, I recommend doing so. It is an acid trip in itself. I saw a 20/20 episode discussing the movie and was intrigued. I finally got to watch the movie and was shocked and slightly disturbed the first time I watched it. The beginning is excellent. Its light and airy and pulls you into the fast, colorful world of the Club Kids. Then, the film turns dark quickly as drugs take over the main characters lives. The end is quick and I believe the murder scene is well filmed. I believe that the actors were well chosen and Mak does a wonderful job portraying Michael Alig. Seth Green as James St. James is halarious. If you read \\"Disco Bloodbath\\" you get a better understanding of James and Seth's interpretion is on the mark.  <br /> <br />All in all, this film is excellent if you are interested in Club culture at all, or enjoy interesting movies that are not necessarily the norm. I love this movie; its one of my favorites. I've shown it to all my friends (college kids) and they love it as well. I have not heard one person I've shown it to (with an open mind) say they did not like it. <br /> <br />Highly recommended to RENT FIRST! <br />The book and soundtrack are also highly recommended.
B000067IZ3|5.0|Traffic definitely showed the world what goes on behind the closed doors in drug traffiking and how people handle it on both sides of the borders.  From one side, It's hard to win the war on drugs when you're the drug czar (Michael Douglas) and your loved ones (Erika Christensen) are doing what you're strongly against.  From another side, you want to protect your family (Catherine Zeta-Jones) but you can't help but know that all your wealth and lifestyles for you and your family are coming from something illegal; something that you know your husband (Steven Bauer) is doing but you refuse to believe it.  As for the other side of the border, what can you do when you're an honest mexican cop (Benicio Del Toro who was just amazing) who's caught between doing the right thing and doing the right thing for the wrong people. <br /> <br />Traffic really opened my eyes from how people operate when it comes to drugs.  It shows how we deal with stopping it, abusing it, selling it, and eventually how it comes to our countries.  All 3 stories don't make sense with each other but seem to come together in the middle while drifting apart towards the end of the film.  Sure it's long (146 minutes) but how are you gonna fit all the details in the movie in just under 100 minutes?  Great film and the best job Steven Soderbergh has ever done in his career.
0195067142|5.0|This book is a masterpiece of writing, fiction or nonfiction.  You are right there in the blood and mud and nightmare with the soldier who wrote this book.  He writes straight from his gut in a way most writers cannot accomplish after a lifetime of writing.  This is not for the squeamish or romantic.  It is war at its most brutal and it is very up close.<br /><br />I came away from this book profoundly moved by the willingness of the author to tell his story in such a plain, unvarnished way and for his sacrifice and for all the soldiers who were not able to speak.  Historically, it is a fasinating look at the ground war in the Pacific, fought by the Marines.  Sledge deals in the day to day life of the soldier on the ground, how he had to fight, what kind of rifle he had, what his foxhole felt like, what it sounded like at night.  The devil's in these details.  We don't hear much about Peleliu any more (can you find it on a map without checking with encarta?)  We don't even hear much about the battle of Okinawa.  The European theater has gotten much of the attention lately.  I don't know why that is, maybe because it's easier to imagine Belgium or France, rather than Guadalcanal or the Solomon Islands.<br /><br />If you have a relative who served in any war, if your father or grandfather was in WW II, read this book for them, and think about what they did.
