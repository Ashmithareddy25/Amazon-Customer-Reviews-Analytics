B000EQ47GS|5.0|This remaster of the awesome 1976 tour de force album is slightly warmer and clearer over the original CD release. The biggest difference is the punchy bass. Don't expect a HUGE difference if you already own the original CD release. The differences are subtle, but they are there. Many CDs suffered from sounding \\"tinny\\" and \\"flat\\" during their release the late 80's. This was one of them. The 2006 remaster has a nice little booklet inside the case that tells of how Tom Scholtz painstakingly remastered the album in 8 or 9 days. Brad Delp's vocals stand out more now. Too bad that Brad isn't still alive. He will always be one of my favorite singers, and Boston will always stand out among all the rest with their tight, clean, and melodious sound. You can hear their brilliance in how they played together. I don't believe I've ever heard a tighter band, and this remastered CD clearly demonstrates how tight and ahead of their time Boston really was.
0767827902|5.0|Nobody needs more superlatives about this movie.  All I can add is it remains one of the definitive movies about the teenage experience, even after almost 40 years, and does not appear the least bit dated.  Just as important, it isn't easy to categorize simply as a \\"Coming of Age movie\\" since it deals just as relevantly with the issues of having one's best years behind oneself (Sam the Lion, and by extension, the town itself) not to mention the struggles of being trapped in a loveless marriage (Ruth Popper & Lois Farrow being two strikingly different sides of the same coin).  It continues to strike a chord on multiple levels.<br /><br />A true classic, made all the more remarkable by the fact that Bogdanovich made perhaps two more movies after this which were remotely worth a damn.  But I guess having one classic to one's credit should be enough.
B000MCIBE8|5.0|This remixed debut album is supposedly the correct speed after decades of being mastered at a slower speed. Apparently, only the 45 RPM single of Light My Fire was the only record off this album cut at the correct speed, but every subsequent release has actually been a little too slow. Inside the 1st album remixed CD there is be an explanation by Bruce Botnick stating why this is so. That really piqued my curiosity.     I have also previously owned most of the Gold CDs, 1988 releases, and 1999 remasters. I have listened to the 1999 remasters and compared them to the 1988 remasters. The 1988 releases were tinny and flat sounding, while the  1999 version of this album was rich and full. I have also compared both of them with this 2007 remix. Clearly, this remix is the way to go. I CANNOT SAY THE SAME FOR THE DOORS REMIX ALBUMS AFTER STRANGE DAYS. After that, they sound waaaaay different which is not what I am pursuing. Some of you probably want a different sound and that's fine. The bottom line: the 2007 remix of the 1st album is \\"brighter\\" and \\"crispier\\" than the 1999 remasters and the 1988 CD release. I believe the 1999 release might sound a bit \\"fuller\\" than this 2007 remix, but I will definitely listen to this version from now on hopefully. Jim's voice is a tad more distant on some of the songs on the \\"2007\\" remix. It's plain as day to hear that. I think the instruments are turned up a bit higher and his voice level remains the same as before. The stereo separation is about the same as the 1999 and 1988 CD release, but the cymbals really come crashing through a lot louder and are more crisp and the drum are punchy. Any way you slice it, the remix gives your tweeters more work to do, but the organ and cymbals do tend to drown Jim out somewhat (but not too bad). This remix, in my opinion stays very close to the way everyone remembers The Doors' first album, only accentuating and embellishing it a bit. I was always disappointed at the tinny and flat sounding 1988 CDs, the 1985 Greatest Hits CD and the DCC 24 Karat Gold CDs as well even though they were a slight improvement.    By the way, just like the 1999 release added some lyrics, those lyrics appear here as well. On Break on Through, Jim says \\"She gets high\\" and on The End a particular expletive appears at the end of the song just as it appears in Apocalypse Now.    This speed issue with \\"Light My Fire\\" is an even bigger difference than The Police's 1978 original album \\"Outlandos d' Amour\\" that features \\"Roxanne\\" which suffered from being mastered at too slow a speed since its first CD release in the late 80's, and it was interesting to hear it on the 2003 remaster at the correct speed. I played \\"Light My Fire\\" to a friend and he picked out the difference immediately.    The speed discrepancy was brought to Bruce Botnick's attention by a Brigham Young University professor who stated that all the video and audio  live performances of The Doors performing Light My Fire, as well as the sheet music show the song being in a key almost a full half step higher than the LP release. That should make sense because when I have seen the Doors perform live on their concert videos they plays the song faster. Also, the verse chords should alternate between A minor and F sharp minor in the song- but instead on the LP and CD versions they are an A Flat minor and an F minor. This explains why on CD releases \\"Light My Fire\\" claims to run 6:50, but in all reality runs around 7:05. Finally, this remixed CD runs at the proper speed. Light my Fire is 6:50 here.     Moonlight Drive Version 1 and 2 are nice to have, along with an alternate Indian Summer, but my main purpose in buying this was to compare/contrast the differences in speed and sound quality and have \\"Light My Fire\\" at the correct speed.
B000001EYO|4.0|this is a fantastic album, if you like ecclectic music, that is. easily one of my favorites.
B000PTYP5C|5.0|As I sit listening to the album for at least the 50th time in the last week, I continue to be amazed. I usually listen to The Presence of Enemies straight through then let the rest of the album flow. I understand the logic for breaking this song up because it is indeed a good starter and strong finishing piece. The idea that it is too much to get past in the beginning may be true but together the parts equal easily one of thier best epic works to date after Six Degrees..., Scenes From a Memory and A Change of Seasons. Thier musicianship still remains unparalleled as does their diversity. Forsaken could easily be a single. I do, however, have a slight problem with this song in that the main riff hearkens back to Waiting For Sleep and Learning To Live from Images and Words. Mind you, I love the riff so it is a microscopic flaw on a true gem. One more comment on it. I can easily hear Evanesence covering it. Constant Motion lives up to it's title. The first single, it is a frenetic romp through the mind of Mike Portnoy. It delivers with guns blazing into the night. The Dark Eternal Night is out and out the HEAVIEST song they have ever done. The growl in James LaBrie's voice was added with efx and beefed by both Mike and John Petrucci lending a dark sinister tone they had never had before. Repentance, the 8th and 9th parts of Mike's recovery from alcoholism, gives us a time to reflect. No less intense than the other songs. It is easily one of thier best slow songs ever and seals them as the band who has worked with EVERYONE. the uncredited confessions in the song come from such diverse people as guitar wiz Steve Vai to the one and only Jon Anderson(YES that Jon Anderson) as well as just plain ordinary close friends of the band. The ministry of Lost Souls is a melancholy look into afterlife. In my mix it is the finisher. It does still maintain an epic quality that leaves you totally satisfied by it's close. I right now rank this as third best album in their catalog. the songs just stick with you. A future classic indeed
B00005JPLW|4.0|This is one of those movies where it's very simple: You know before you watch whether you will hate it or love it. Consider me the latter.     Don't expect \\"Best Actor\\" skills from Gerard Butler, but do be prepared to be stunned by the visual genius of Frank Miller. The fighting cinematography is revolutionary. With slow motion, speed-ups, and zoom-ins at exactly the right moments, the battle sequences themselves are things of legend.    The screenplay was nothing to write home about. It seemed like the screenwriter focused too much on trying to make hardcore quotes (which it did) than actually to further the plot.     All in all, it was a very hardcore, rough-and-tumble action flick which could be great for you to watch with your buddies.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Competent and gripping adventure with all the ingredients to satisfy the inner kid in every male. Visually excellent. A couple of minor niggles: at one point Mark Wahlberg's character makes a shot from a rowing-boat which is so implausible as to be laughable, and it's just not necessary for the plot. Also, would someone like Swagger - accustomed to knocking people over from a mile away - really spend so much time standing around nicely framed in doorways in a 'hot zone'?     But as I say, these are small niggles in an otherwise very watchable flick. You're likely to like this if you liked: The Day of the Jackal (Fox, not Willis), Rambo - First Blood (but not the sequels...), The Hunted (Lee Jones, Del Toro). If you thought 'Sniper' (Berenger) was great  back in 1993, well, perhaps you're grown up enough to like 'Shooter' now...  ;^)

0385522401|5.0|This is such a beautiful little novel, the best McEwan I've read so far. It seems so simple and you don't realise how complex it is until you finish it. You don't realise how much McEwan has worked a little spell on you until it's all over. It concerns two virginal young sweethearts from the early '60s (pre sexual revolution), Edward and Florence, on their wedding night. In the first part of the book, Florence's fear and dread of sex and her absolute disgust is explained, as is Edward's long pent-up sexual desires- pent-up and caged by the world as it was then. In order to have a respectable life, married, children etc., Florence has to undergo the necessity of sex, which the decorum of the day has enabled her to hide from during their engagement, and even helped foster her revolt. The second part concerns the disastrous consumation attempt. The third part, the end, concerns their very hurtful meeting on Chesil Beach, minutes afterwards. In between these three parts we are told of their families, backgrounds etc. At the end we are told something of their futures. There is no blame from McEwan to either character. It is all simply and beautifully laid out, and afterwards I just felt so sorry for both, two tragic people shaped by nature and the world as it was. This is fiction but they felt so real to me and had me thinking long aftwerwards.
0060512806|5.0|This book -- and Stephenson as an author, in general -- will remind you how much you love reading.  If you feel like your life is too fast-paced to have time to sit with a good novel for a couple of hours a week, pick this sucker up and by the end of the month you'll be back into fiction.  It's all over the place, and multiple times a day you'll be reminded of it and will want to go read it some more...   I guess Stephenson is an addiction of sorts.      Enjoy!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly really prevailed with this CD. she is awesome on it. Her voice is as beautiful as ever. All the negative media crap about had me worried about it.. although I always kept thinking, \\"wait its Kelly they're talking about\\" I understand that it is COMPLETELY different from her other 2 albums. But I am so glad she did it. I hope everything turns out to be a huge success for her, because she deserves it. She can sing anything, anything at all. and I am very glad she chose to sing what she wanted. The whole CD is great.. I don't need to rate each individual song. Kelly ... congrats... I love you, we love you... you're amazing.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I received my CD just two days ago and at first only liked a few songs, NA, SOBER and IRVINE.  After several listens, I realized just how great this CD is - the songs stay in head and I must say I like just about every song on the CD. KC, please come to New Orleans on your next tour.  Do youself a favor, pick up a copy and give it several listens - you will absolutely love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

0345404475|4.0|Dick is a highly productive writer, producing many mediocre Sci.Fi novels, but Do androids dream of electric sheep is not one of them. A tale of philosophy and of humanity and immensely more powerfull than the film version titled Blade Runner. Dick, as always, produces some rather controversial aspects of human nature and society, as it could have been, or maybe will be, off cause in an exaterated nature by which he delivers his morale. A product of the time it was written, the danger of a nuclear war and the world that would be leftover is the driving factor in the novel, but Dick tells a story which is incredibly relevant in the world we live in, right now. Close to a classic, and if you want to read just one novel by Philip K. Dick, it better be this one!
B000QFCD2W|5.0|Such an F'n Masterpiece, I've always been a KD supporter, just he'll release a masterpiece then a dud, ect ect... Loving albums like Abigail, Fatal Portrait and the rest of the 80s albums i never got into the 4 albums that came out in the 90s. I loved Puppet Master and felt it was a strong release for KD at the time. Now to this gem! Upon first listen i wasn't very much into it but as i had it on repeat, byt the 2nd time i started to recognize alot of diff things going on. By the 3rd listen i was hooked and i think this is one of my favorite metal albums of 2007 right about now. Story is alright, nothing to crazy but a simple ghost story. BUY IT!
0812550757|5.0|Continuing from the great work in Enders game, Card completely changes path with his writings in Speaker for the Dead. The story is philosophical, the conversations are almost like essays, and Card really makes you wonder as the reader about fundamental issues in human nature, and in how society has evolved. Card uses cunning wit to deliver his punchline, and you are really left wondering if not all conflicts, all wars, genicides and racial conflicts through the ages are due to a fundamental inherent (dis)ability in man to trust anyone that is slightly different from himself. Secondly, Card creates the concept of a speaker for the dead, which is almost religious in its proportions and is a brilliant concept. Ender is becoming the savior of mankind but without the ability to save himself. Brilliant work, and best sequel ever in Sci.Fi
0792151712|2.0|Like this film there really were a J. Dawson and Tommy Ryan aboard the Titanic. But they were both members of the Crew and they both drowned. And this pretty much says it all about this film in its historical accuracy.     I watched this one while puppy sitting. And I don't have much to say for it other than watching one of the pups look me in the eye and piss on the carpet in front of me as I watched this film more entertaining.     Wonderful costuming. Beutiful and very accurate sets. (These  are why I don't give it just One Star). Good acting but a lousy class warfare driven story and an awful plot with characters who are absolutely too two dimensional to believe.    And what is this story? A 'salvage'/preservation effort at looting the Titanic turns up a drawing of a naked girl wearing a valuable diamond. And then the story follows. She's a seventeen year old girl sold into matrimonial slavery by her fortune hunting mother to a nasty rich kid who is taking her back to missery in Pittsburg. He's a smoking drinking gambling bohemian American expatriate artist on his way home to a questionable future recently from the  Left bank of Paris where he drew naked women who dies in the end but 'frees' her. Everyone poor is portrayed virtuous. Everyone rich is portrayed as bad, selfish, greedy arrogant and snobbish. Which is an insult to the men like John Jacob Astor who died giving up their places on the life boats for poor women to board saying Women and Children First.     And it really sucks.     They can't even get their math up on the Lifeboats ratio to passenghers. Titanic was designed to carry more than three thousand five hundred passengers and crew while her lifeboat capacty was less than one thousand two hundred. Through poor organization they didn't even use that capacity rather than what this film implies.     No scenes really impressed me much beyond scenery and costuming but if there is one scene that really disgusts me it is that of the crew holding third class passengers at bay and at gun point as first class passengers board the lifeboats.  Next to that it is Murdoch shooting third class passengers trying to get to the last boats, something he did not do.    Overall this film is a BIG BIG disapointment.
1904233023|5.0|Enders Game is a classic tale, prawning into the deepest part of our society and our humanity, and Card spins a tale of morale and ethic in our world by projecting it in the future and among the stars. A tale of humanity, fear, the unknown, and racism, Card demonstrates an insigh knowledge of group psychology and group dynamics while creating the highly appealing character of Ender. The book is a good read by any measure, and is hard to put away once you are started, but your reading experience will depend on how much you relate to the character of Ender, how much of yourself you see in him and his experiences. Card has created a classic on the same level as Herbert's Dune and Asimov's trilogy
B000OZ2H0W|5.0|This is the 3rd album from DevilDriver, & man does it kick some serious @ss! It looks like this time around Dez & company found the right combination of brutality & melody to make each track not only pump you up, but also much more memorable compared to the last 2 albums (and that's kind of a bold statement considering DevilDriver's last album 'The Fury of Our Maker's Hand' was a huge improvement over the first album.) I loved hearing this album so much (I heard tracks from various sources) I instantly bought a copy well before the US release date. BUY IT! You won't regret it!

B000O75F7C|3.0|This album makes me angry for what it could have been. This feels like an unfinished project. There's so many good melodies and hooks, but they go no where or don't last that long. These are great riffs and melodies that could have been turned into short 3 minute songs that would have payed off more. Especially the first song. Fear Of A Blank Planet. If it was shortened and more tightly edited. That would be a brilliant song, instead it's incredibly long winded, about halfway it starts to become what could have been another great song, but it's just thrown away to be the ending of the song, wtf? Every song is like that on this album. It's almost like they had a few really great songs, but not enough songs for a full album. So they mixed everything they had together and decided to make them all lengthy super tracks.
1400044162|5.0|We know from the blurb that this is a novel about the civil war in Nigeria;  but it all begins placidly enough around 1962.  Ugwu, a 13 year old boy from a poor village, is taken on as a houseboy by Odenigbo, a mathematics lecturer at the university of Nsukka, near Enugu, in the South-East of Nigeria, the area that would in 1967 be known as Biafra. (It would have been helpful if the book had included a map of Nigeria for those readers unacquainted with its regions and its geography.)  He lives with the beautiful Olanna, who is back in Nigeria after having got a Masters Degree from London University, and who has moved from her home town Lagos (where the majority population was Yoruba) to Nsukka to be with him.  They are all Igbos.  Olanna has simple but much-loved relatives at Kano in the North, where the majority population are the Muslim Hausa.  When she visits them there, \\"she felt that things were in order, the way they were meant to be\\" (p.39)  Also in Nsukka, working on a book, is Richard Churchill, the shy English lover of Olanna's sister Kainene, who lives in Port Harcourt (the main port of what would become Biafra).  All these characters and the relationships between them are well described, and they would have made an interesting novel on their own, even without the later parts about their experiences during the war.<br /><br />The first section of the book brings to life many facets of Nigerian life (and food):  the first-generation educated intelligentsia, so different from their parents and resentful of colonialism and neo-colonialism;  the sleazy politicians; the servants; a host of Igbo expressions (though they are not always translated).  Occasionally tribal differences are touched on, but nothing except such knowledge as readers may already have had prepares them for the ferocity that these differences will engender after Igbo officers overthrew and murdered Abubakar Balewa, Nigeria's first  President and a Northern Muslim, in January 1966.<br /><br />A counter-coup, supported by the Hausas and the Yoruba, put General Gowon in power in July 1966, and Igbos were attacked in Lagos and massacred in the North.  The Igbos then proclaimed the independence of their region in May 1967 and called it Biafra.  (Its flag had on it half the yellow sun of the title).  In July that year Gowon launched an attack on the secessionist state.  The Biafran War began.  Eventually Biafra was battered and notoriously starved into capitulation (1970) after Port Harcourt had fallen.<br /><br />These events naturally impinge on our cast of characters.  Olanna is in the North when the massacre begins, and manages to escape back to  Nsukka;  Richard, too, returning via Kano airport from a visit to England, is a traumatized witness.  Enugu, Biafra's first capital,  and Nsukka, near the northern border of Biafra, had to be abandoned when the Nigerian army comes close to it.  Odenigbo, Olanna and Ugwu move to Abba, Odenigbo's home town, which replaced Enugu as the capital;  then have to move again, to Umuahia, the next capital; and then that town falls also.  They experience air raids, food shortages, press-ganging and lawlessness, of all of which we have graphic and haunting images.<br /><br />The book is divided into four sections, called respectively `The Early Sixties', `The Late Sixties', `The Early Sixties' and `The Late Sixities'.  In other words the first and third sections are about the period before the war, while the second and fourth deal with the impact of the war.  So in the second part there are unexplained allusions to the third.  This kind of device works for the kind of novel in which the revealing of some secret is essential to the plot; but the point of it in this book escapes me.<br /><br />But this is a small niggle about a memorable book about unforgettable people and about a war that should not be forgotten.up, supported by the Hausas and the Yoruba, put General Gowon in power in July 1966, and Igbos were attacked in Lagos and massacred in the North.

B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I rented this at Blockbuster the other night and all I have to say that this is an amazing movie. Check out Prestige too which in my opinion is even better. This movie really had my brain thinking hard near the ending and after it. It has an interesting plot and his magic tricks are interesting. You have to watch this...a great movie that will give your mind a whirl.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|Rarely does a film so magically project so many fantastical tricks (within a fictional story so expertly presented as to appear historical). In the end, of course, all tricks are exposed as the smoke and mirrors expected from the beginning--but in such fine detail and complexity as not to disappoint.<br /><br />The film's strength rests on that of &#34;Eisenheim the Illusionist,&#34; Pulitzer Prize-winning novelist Steven Millhauser's 1990 short story (from Barnum Museum), but also resides in Dick Pope's cinematography and Neil Burger's adept direction. It is quite amazing to watch magical tricks for so long propel the tale, as if real--and then to view the delightful unraveling of the story's entwined, sinewy web of script, image, characters and score (Philip Glass), like the finale of a perfectly executed pas de deux. It flows gracefully through to the last second.<br /><br />The movie begins as Vienna's Chief Police Inspector Uhl (Paul Giamatti) recounts the life, to date (1900) of a carpenter's son, a forbidden friend of Countess Sophie von Teschen, (Eleanor Tomlinson) for whom he carved a magic locket and with whom he had planned to flee. They were discovered and forcibly separated.<br /><br />The boy departed Vienna and toured exotic countries in Asia, acquiring extensive magical knowledge. He arrived home 15 years later as the performer &#34;Eisenheim&#34; (Edward Norton), and with the help of theatrical manager Josef Fischer (Edward Marsan), he immediately attracts  an enormous following. Crown Prince Leopold (Rufus Sewell), determined to prove Eisenheim a fraud, attends a show arm in arm with his gorgeous fianc&eacute;e--Countess Sophie (Jesscia Biel). The Crown Prince volunteers Sophie for an elaborate stage trick. Eisenhem instantly recognizes her and pretends not to know her; Sophie realizes more slowly. Naturally, they reunite romantically.<br /><br />But that is far from the end of the magic, or the mystery encompassed in this engrossing film. Norton's Eisenheim characterization grabs viewers and balances equally against Biel's angelic portrayal of Sophie. Giamatti's Inspector Uhl, an ambitious, devious, outwardly crusty official controlled by the Prince, also demonstrates a weakness for magic, and beneath that layer, a tenuous warmth that slowly takes root and grows.<br /><br />One viewer claims the film is too long on time and too short on romance. I disagree. The level of intrigue was exactly perfect for a film of this kind, enough to draw us in, but not so much as to detract from the other, far more magical aspects of the story.<br /><br />This film is a crowd-pleaser--pure magic.<br /><br />--Alyssa A.

He's sorely missed on this effort; though he participated, it's in a very minor way.  Lyrically, this effort pales in comparison to other LP efforts. The lyrics here are so, well, lame:   \\"You will pay for what you've done.\\"  Hell, I've penned better than that.  And the bar chords on \\"No More Sorrow\\" are just embarrassing.  In a nutshell, I'm exceptionally disappointed.

His heartfelt and honest account of his boy soldier years, his \\"forced\\" rehabilitation and his resilience and strength to find a way out before he is re-recruited are vowen with stories of childhood, memories of parents and friends, joys and sadnesses of his particular childhood years. It is almost as he reaches out his hands through the pages to touch reader's heart and ask the reader to be careful about judging him, or about judging anyone he describes in the book. He brilliantly finishes by sharing an African story told to him many times. Through this story he poses a question, which he indirectly asks the reader to ponder in his own life as well. Take the time to ponder this question, it could change the way you view life.     Beah's book is one story in an endless sea of suffering thousands of children go through as war and conflict engulf their homelands. It is an important read, teaching on a personal level the challenges of the child-soldiering and the sacrifices we all should be making to stop it. For he is only one child out of 300.000, who gave his ultimate best to find peace...
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|After months of controversy surrounding the original American Idol, Kelly Clarkson finally got to release 'My December.' I don't see what the big deal was. 'Breakaway' is one of the best pop albums I own. Kelly got to make her songwriting debut on 'Because of You.' 'Addicted' and 'Hear Me' were amazing pop-rock tracks, and they should have prepared fans for 'My December.' 'My December' is a beautiful collection of very personal words. Kelly wrote or co-wrote every single track. With issues spanning from betrayal to heartbreak to loneliness to the suicide of close friend, Kelly pours her emotion out on each track. Clive Davis wanted another sure smash album like 'Breakaway,' but you can't have a duplicate. Artists evolve, and that is exactly what Kelly did here. This album is edgier, darker, and a heck of a lot more honest. People are saying they don't hear a radio smash, but because this sound is so different, all they can picture is the successful past of 'Since U Been Gone,' so 'Never Again' doesn't work for them the way it works for true fans. As much as I love 'Breakaway,' 'My December' is now my favorite album! Here is a description of each track:    1) NEVER AGAIN - Although this song hasn't hit number 1 on the charts, it still gets deserved radio/video play. Some consider this the sequel to 'Since U Been Gone.' I love the rage and passion of this track. I love this bold first single.    2) ONE MINUTE - I first heard this song when she performed it on Daytona 500. This song is poppy and catchy, and Kelly says she wants to release it as a single. If that is the case, I think this one is radio-friendly.    3) HOLE - This is one of my favorite tracks. This song rocks and I would love to see it as a single. You can tell she is having fun here doing what she wanted and what she loves!    4) SOBER - This is the beautiful second single. Kelly released this ballad early to show diversity on the album before it hit stores. I can't wait to see the music video! This songgives me the chills.    5) DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME - This song has the pop appeal, in my opinion, to be released and played on the radio. Everyone can relate to the friend that disappoints you.    6) JUDAS - This is another favorite of mine. It has the catchy, pop-rock appeal, but Kelly feels it may be too personal or offensive to be a single. This song describes, in a sense, someone that turns against faith/God/Jesus/Kelly. There are many different angles. Sometimes Kelly seems to sing from the perspective of Jesus. This may be a track Clive wanted to trash from the album.     7) HAUNTED - This is like the sequel to 'Addicted.' I love the scratchy, choppy musical intro. Kelly's range certainly soars here, and leads to the \\"creepy\\" ending: 'You were smiling.' This one lives up to its title.    8) BE STILL - This is the beautiful, laid-back track that is winning over many critics. It's being compared to Sarah McLaughlin. Absolutely gorgeous. For those against the negative lyrics throughout the album, this song can be more related to love and/or trying to preserve love.    9) MAYBE - Kelly performed this at many of her concerts as a preview to the album. It starts out with a beautiful acoustic guitar, leading up to powerful climax. This song has my favorite lyrics...a beautiful way to describe herself and her needs and flaws.    10) HOW I FEEL - This song is very radio-friendly and upbeat. It has a No Doubt feel to it and it will definitely get stuck in your head. It is stated this will most likely be a single. I can't wait!    11) YEAH - This track stands alone as being the funky, R&B song on the album. Kelly says this was inspired by the music of Prince. Fun, flirty, and sexy, this one takes away from the more negative feel of the album, which many doubtful buyers will appreciate.    12) CAN I HAVE A KISS - This is being compared to Sheryl Crow. It has that fun, singer-songwriter feel to it. This is another favorite of mine. Kelly didn't expect to release it as a single, but says she may now that many fans are giving such positive reviews about it.    13) IRVINE - The most beautiful track of the album. Kelly sounds so pure and gorgeous here, questioning God after a friend committed suicide (that is what is rumored to be the theme). Another favorite of many.    Hidden track) CHIVAS - The lyrics to this song are hilarious. She is making fun of a guy she hooked up with when lonely and perhaps, desperate. This is a fun surprise after the journey of the beautiful, dark 'December.' It has an old record player quality to it.    *Bonus) I recommend the song 'Dirty Little Secert' from iTunes! I really wish it would have been included on the album. It's too good to be just an exclusive track. This song is full of soul and blues. Honestly, I wish Kelly could have put a lot more tracks on 'My December!'    If Kelly has held strong with sales on Amazon, I really can't wait to see how many copies this album sold so far, and what number this album debuted at on the charts when this information is released. Let's hope she proved Clive wrong!
0061122416|4.0|This story transports the reader to a mysterious land of beauty and  romance where a shepherd boy learns the secret to living a meaningful, successful life in harmony with God's creation.  (It's pursuing your \\"Personal Legend,\\" as we're told a few too many times for such a slim volume.)     Nevertheless, the story puts a smile on your face and makes some nice (if occasionally heavy handed) points about living a good life.  It's well worth the small investment of time it requires.
B000O1799U|5.0|I just watched this movie an hour ago.  Obviously the folks who vote for the Oscars were incorrect.  Well, consider the fact that Jennifer Hudson was voted out pretty early in American Idol.  That was a precedent.  I knew how good Hudson was back then.  Well, at least Hudson deservedly has an Oscar now but the movie should have won Best Picture simply because it WAS.      As a biracial person, I love how this was a Black movie.  The producer/director did not find the need to put in a white character that the wider/whiter audience could relate to.  If the movie was released even 10 or 15 years ago that may have occurred.     The movie didn't need a white character because anyone can relate to the various themes that the movie covered: ambition, love, entrepreneurship, exploitation, drug use/abuse, family, hurt, pain, pregancy, welfare/unemployment, fame, racism, fatphobia/sizism and of course, music - from the chitlin' circuit through disco.    And Eddie Murphy.  Unbelievable.  I haven't been a fan of his for YEARS - since SNL circa early '80s - so I was stunned to see his performance.  Wow, what a stroke of genius in casting Murphy in that role!    Jennifer Hudson's \\"And I Am Telling You\\" was incredible.  It may wind up being a landmark in movie history just as we remember how Jennifer Holliday made the song famous in the Broadway version.
B00003CXRM|5.0|Comedies don't get much better than this.<br /><br />Clooney, Turturro, and Tim Blake Nelson are relentlessly hilarious in this loosely Homeric epic of escape from a chain gang in America's early twentieth-century South. You can love this movie without knowing Homer, of course, though it's based on that bard's Oddysey.<br /><br />That's the common touch of both Homer and his erstwhile partners-in-crime, producers Ethan and Joel Coen.<br /><br />Filming this flick must have been more fun than a body should have. From the blind oracle on the railroad pump-car warning about the 'Ob-stackles of life' to the 'Sigh-REENS' that appear to have 'loved (Pete) up ... and then turned him into a horny toad' to the delicious stares and triumphant penultimate scene where the Soggy Bottom Boys regale a political rally with their irresistable hit 'Man of Constant Sorrows', O BROTHER never falters.<br /><br />It's a film for watching over and over again, preferably introducing somebody who hasn't seen it each time you do.<br /><br />Ne'er doubt! Buy O BROTHER WHERE ARE THOU and hold onto it for dear life.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I absolutely loved hearing this album!! It is very different from \\"Breakaway\\", but I love the diversity in her music. Some of the songs are a lot darker then previous efforts, but Kelly is expressing the emotions she was feeling at the time of writing. She is staying true to herself and her fans. All of the negative press and criticisms surrounding this release are totally false!! Kelly continues to prove that she deserves to have a voice in the music industruy and continues to grow as an artist because of it. I definatly recommend this album to anyone willing to listen. HBP!!
1401302378|5.0|Chris Anderson does a great job of explaining the concept of the long tail.  He shows how over the last couple hundred years the history of business is a history of hits.  Businesses tried to carry what would sell the most.  Bookstores carried the best sellers.  Movie theaters showed the top selling movies.  Music stores only carried records they thought would sell in volume.      This has changed with the development of the internet.  Now companies like Amazon can sell almost any book ever printed.  This is the long tail, all the products that businesses can sell that before they couldn't sell in volume high enough to generate a profit.  Now companies like Netflix can carry almost any professional movie ever made.  YouTube is taking this a step farther and providing an outlet for all the amateur movies recorded.   iTunes sells a huge portion of the songs recorded.  There are other businesses exploiting the long tail.    Chris Anderson found that there are a couple requirements for an online store selling products to be successful with the long tail concept.  The first couple conditions make sense, there has to be a way for more people to create the product, and a way to get the product out to the consumers.  Computers now allow many more people to be involved in the production of books, movies and songs.   The third condition is there has to be a way for customers to find what they want.  Internet search engines make it almost trivial to find that unusual game, toy, or electronic device that you've heard about or even just wondered if it existed.    The world is a complex place.  It can be overwhelming.  A model like The Long Tail provides insight and understanding into what otherwise would be just over powering noise.      Chris provides fascinating examples.  He has a lot of interesting data.  This book is very insightful, and well worth reading.
B00005JPQT|5.0|Live Free or Die Hard is a crowning jewel in the Die Hard series. It can be argued that it is the best Die Hard movie in many ways. The plot is grander, scarier and the stakes significantly higher. Cyber terrorism's nightmarish consequences make the audience stay on the edge of their seats for the better part of the movie.<br /><br />Bruce Willis as the NYPD detective John McLane is as much an action star in Live Free or Die Hard as he was in the original act of 1988. All that has changed is the scope. Indeed the grandeur of the action sequences including his bringing down a helicopter with a car and an F35 with a truck leave you gasping for more.<br /><br />Overall, a must see action movie.
B0001XALTG|5.0|There are plenty of movies that show the traditional comming of age tale, but nothing compares to the comical, extreme and sometimes painfully true film that is 'Trainspotting'. Trainspotting is the story of five screwed up pals looked upon as the dirt and rejected in their Scottish upbrining. Each over their heads in their own screwed up addictions. Everything from substance abuse, to theivery, to petefilia, these guys have dug their own graves so deep it would be a miricle to get out of it. Yet the main character Mark Renton played by the brilliant Ewen McGreggor is the one that is forced to change his ways against his own will. Through loving parants and a high school student he accidentally had relations with, Mark manages to begin enjoying life. Even when temptation arrives again in the form of his mates he still manages to free himself eventhough he admits to being a bad person he knows he is on the right track with our without the people that made a major impression on his life.<br /><br />This story is one of the most relatable ones I have seen in all the movies I have seen that tell this story. In life we all grow up with a small circle of friends. These are the people who let into the deepest darkest corners of our souls. Even if they may the most brilliant of people, or low lives, from those who are pure to those that are pure evil we kept them close just because they trusted and understood who we were. Yet a time comes in all our lives where we must face the real world put aside the childish games and sacrifce our time to jobs and keep our lives in line with modern society. It is up to those same friends who we still hold dear to our hearts or just hate to join or be left behind in the gutter to rot. It is not because we are bad people who don't care about others, it's because they are not willing to join us on the road ahead.

B000KLRUJS|5.0|Solti's Elektra was the very first recording to remove all cuts from the score (as with all the Maestro's recorded work).  For many listeners such as myself, it is perhaps the definitive Elektra on disc, not only for the high voltage intensity of the singing, but also for Solti's energetic conducting of the score and the magnificent detail at which the entire sound picture of Elektra is revealed in this recording.  Although I love Karajan's 1965 Elektra at Salzburg with Astrid Varnay and Jeffrey Tate's 1990 recording from Geneva with Gwyneth Jones and Leonie Rysanek, this recording captures what is perhaps one of the most compelling performances of the opera on record.  There is first of all Birgit Nilsson's command performance in the title role.  There has never been a soprano who had Nilsson's uncanny ability to sing what is perhaps Strauss' most difficult role for soprano with the kind of ease and power that we can hear in this recording.  Perhaps one would wish that a darker timbre and a more \\"agonized\\" sound would have taken the role, but Strauss' vocal writing simply poses no hurdles for the soprano as she hurls the high notes that made her famous.  It is also note complete, so we get to hear whatever notes and texts we don't hear in the theatre.  A brilliant performance, and perhaps one of Nilsson's greatest achievements in the studio.  She is partnered by the Klytämnestra of Regina Resnik, who offers a grotesque interpretation that rightly contrasts well with Leonie Rysanek's erotic, theatrical assumption many years later.  Resnik makes a caricature out of the role that may either satisfy the listener of displease him depending one whether one wants something more realistic or more extreme.  Marie Collier, likewise, sings Chrysothemis with all the theatrical effects that would have been avoided by Leonie Rysanek many years earlier in the theater.  I find that this great artist (who we lost when she was so tragically young) imbues her character with the right kind of psychological madness that all the more tips the already tipsy boat in the opera.  Gerhard Stolze makes the already grotesque Aegisthus more grotesque than he already is.  Tom Krause sings Orest with conviction, although one could wish for someone like Hans Hotter to sing the role in order to convey the nobility and grandeur of the character.      Solti leads the Vienna Philharmonic in the frenzy that this score truly typifies.  I still wish that they had asked Karajan to do this opera in the studio since he was able to bring so much out of Strauss' score, but we at least have these gargantuan forces to contend with in the absence of a Karajan studio recording.    A truly mad and demented performance if there ever was one, but you should look at Gwyneth Jones' 1990 performance from Claves records to hear what a theatrical Elektra should sound like.

B00005JPFC|5.0|I saw this with my family last night.  We have a five year old.  She loved it.  The animation is stellar, especially the shots of Paris which look completely real.  There are a couple of scary parts, but they are over quickly.<br /><br />My wife and I also enjoyed this movie.  It does have some --thankfully brief-- completely adult humor involving a gun.  It passes quickly however.<br /><br />The only minor complaint is that it seemed a little overlong to me.  There are a lot of plot points to wrap up, however, and so nothing could be taken out in my opinion.  So five stars, but purchase the small drink rather than the large one!<br /><br />There is plenty to like for the kid set... the rats are amazingly cute.  Also adults won't be bored because there are lots of things to look and laugh at.

One minute you're hearing an echo from \\"Chinatown\\" (\\"Forget it, Nick...It's Sandford.\\"), then you're hearing from SotD (\\"What, haven't you ever taken a short cut before?\\"), seeing action from \\"Point Break\\", and who'll ever forget the penultimate scene, complete with birds taking off, a la John Woo, in any of his action movies.    These guys took every cop movie cliche, put it into less than two hours, didn't demean the sources, made it funny *and* tense (my wife actually *screamed* at one scene), and ended up with a movie I'll see again and again.    Best. Cop. Movie. Ever.        BTW:  Anyone catch \\"The Wicker Man\\" reference?  Yes indeed, these guys went out of their way to include police movie references.

Would Carl Palmer be able to excel the same way as he did on the first Atomic Rooster LP? Could Greg Lake justify leaving King Crimson?<br /><br />The musical diversity and brilliance of the six tracks answered every question with a resounding \\"YES.\\" \\"The Barbarian\\" with the down and dirty sound reaches for your lungs and places an everlasting choke hold.<br /><br />\\"Take A Pebble\\" is one of the finest vocals every witnessed. Lake's voice is in perfect harmony with Emerson's piano. The lyrics are majestic and the composition brings all things to an immediate stop. Your ears fixated on the wizardry never believing what they have heard but ready for a second listen the moment the masterpiece ceases.<br /><br />\\"Knife-Edge\\" brings to the forefront Greg's bass with intense musical direction. Numerous live tours would see this in the set list for obvious reasons.<br /><br />\\"The Three Fates/Lachesis/Atropos\\" Emerson's piano style of mixing classical style compositions with progressive rocks freedom of expression has kept a legion of fans salivating on every note.<br /><br />\\"Tank\\" lets Carl do his thing but that doesn't mean the band is taking a rest. Listen to the well constructed musical passes that only enhance Carl's ability to be complex and tasty. Many drummers know their theory but leave you as bored as a rainy summer day. Palmer can be adventurous in a ballad or a rocker.<br /><br />\\"Lucky Man\\" would give ELP entry into the singles charts and become one of the most recognizable tunes from its era. Don't sweep this under the \\"Commercial Rug.\\" The acoustic guitar that Lake beautifies each time out resonates with brilliance and the words are some of the best ever penned.<br /><br />Any ELP fan would agree from the first release through Brain Salad Surgery you couldn't go wrong. Many will add Works 1 and Works 2 (They should) in their collections as well. If you use this album as a starting point, you'll love the journey in the proper sequences. If you decide to skip around that's fine too.

0767802470|5.0|I've heard it said that combat is long periods of boredom, punctuated by moments of sheer terror.  Well, this movie has it in spades.    From what I know of WWII history, this movie is accurate.  Beyond that, you spend hours in the confined quarters of desperate men making the best they can of a bad situation.    Naturally, the movie ends on a down note.    Quite a ride.  Loved it.
031286504X|5.0|Easily the best novel I have ever read. My only complaint would be that it is so short. I would have read 900 pages of Neville's story if it were there.<br /><br />I grew up reading primarily Stephen King books and I heard that this novel was a great influence on King so I gave it a try. I can see why King holds it in such high regard.<br /><br />This book isn't really so much a horror story, but an apocolyptic tale of survival, love, science and sorrow. Surely it sounds like an odd combination, but thats what makes it so remarkable.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and read this book. It will not dissapoint
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I don't know what all the fuss has been about, Kelly Clarksons My December is by far a brilliant album by one of todays top female vocalists. No it does not contain another smash hit like Since U Been Gone, but honestly how can you top that. There are numerous songs that come close. One Minute comes the closest. It has an 80's feel to it and has the albums most sing along chorus.Can I Have a Kiss?,  Don't Waste Your Time and How I Feel are just as good, proving Clarkson can make pop songs better than alot of other artists out today. What truly makes this album though is her voice which she uses to full effect on the hypnotic ballad Sober which builds and builds into a stunning vocal near the end that gives me chills everytime I hear it. Be Still showcases Clarksons softer vocal skills proving that you don't need to wail at the top of your lungs to prove you can sing. Same can be said for the intimate closing balla Irvine. A heartbreaking song and vocal. While some of her harder edged \\"rock\\" songs such as Hole and Judas don't seem to fit into Clarkson, thats when it seems to be she's trying a bit too hard, but they still are good songs. While not as radio friendly as Breakaway, My December is a wonderful album that I hope everyone will give a chance. It shows Clarkson growing as an artist and proving she's in this for the long haul. Best Tracks: Sober, One Minute, and Can I Have a Kiss?

1400063515|5.0|Talbeb gives us numerous examples of Black Swan events. I was interested in the book in order to discover how Talbeb himself became a victim of a Black Swan event but alas he must be holding that back for another book. The guy is brilliant no doubt about it. THe demand for the book is off the charts. I understand that he got the publisher to print his manuscript as submitted a very rare event. The book of course reflects this.Talbeb was a Wall Street option trader who developed a method to buy out of the money options, both puts and calls. This technique will generate many small losses but occasionally a very profitable trade. The method insures that you will never experience a disastrous loss. But apparently Talbeb did experience one. I wonder as others have just what happened for him to leave the business. The book however will not reveal what happened to his trading scheme.

B000OZ2CZW|4.0|Not that she really ever left. 3 months or so after I was getting over A Girl Like Me, Rihanna comes out with this. This album, on first listen, is terrible. That's what I thought. But then you go further into the music, listen to the lyrics, and learn to love it. Here's a song by song breakdown.....    1. Umbrella - Catchy as hell, this upbeat yet not really song has all the makings of a hit, and it is. She sounds great on it, and although the chorus forever sounds stupid to me (the 'ella, ella, aye, aye, aye' part), this is a great choice for a single. (9/10)    2. Push Up On Me - She sounds amazing in this song, but the lyrics leave a lot to be desired. A lot. It's rather skanky, and really suits the ambiguous title of the album. I didn't want Rihanna to head in this direction admittedly, but despite the Hilton feel, I love how she sounds. (6/10)    3. Don't Stop The Music - I hate dance music, but you can't help loving this song. Hell, it's probably one of the catchiest songs I've ever heard. Ever. It's just about dancing, clubbing, you know, not stopping the music. It could do without the faint Michael Jackson extract, but it is a nice touch nonetheless. Great song. (8.5/10)    4. Breakin' Dishes - This is a hate it or love it track. Personally, I love it. The raw emotion that she projects, despite not using her vocal range, which I would've liked, is amazing and just makes you feel the anger. It's about her man staying out all night and not coming home. She's breakin' dishes. (9/10)    5. Shut Up And Drive - Great R&B/Rock song. She's fusioned two genres together perfectly, and it's REALLY catchy. As with pretty much every other song on the album. It's a great choice for her second single, due to the fact that it could push her further up the pop charts while securing her a spot in the R&B mainstream. (9/10)    6. Hate That I Love You - Heartwarming song. Kidding. It's the opposite, but still cute. Basically about not being able to leave someone that she wantsto, even though she doesn't want to be there. (7.5/10)    7. Say It - Fun reggae song. One of my favourites on the album because she's returning to her R&B roots, rather than the pop direction that she'd been heading in for the first part of the album. (9/10)    8. Sell Me Candy - Hands down the best song on the album. Enjoyable summer reggae track that is one of the best this year. It's absolutely amazing and I just couldn't stop listening when I first bought this. (10/10)    9. Lemme Get That - In my opinion, the only downfall of the album. Bad song about her taking her man's money and despite being catchy, the song just falls flat. (4/10)    10. Rehab - Upbeat ballad about addictions. The soul of the album. In this song she really shows off her vocal range and sounds the best she has in a long time. Just great. (9.5/10)    11. Question Existing - Her vocals sound somewhat distorted in this song, but irregardless, she sounds great. The song is about flawed body and self image, and joins 'Rehab' as part of the soulful and moralistic heart of the album. (9/10)    12. Good Girl Gone Bad - The title track. It explains the title, and it doesn't mean what I expected. At all. About the fact that once a good girl goes bad, there's no return. Good, solid track. (7/10)    13. Cry (Australian Bonus Track) - First real ballad on the album, and it's an enjoyable song. I like it. (6.5/10)    Overall, solid album that I didn't expect from first listen. I recommend you buy it. :)
B000000OQY|5.0|While Guns N' Roses debut album \\"Appetite for Destruction\\" (1987) initially failed to make a major impact, over the course of a few months, with singles like \\"Welcome to the Jungle\\" and \\"Sweet Child `O Mine,\\" almost overnight, Guns N' Roses became the biggest band on the planet.<br /><br />To capitalize on the band's success, Geffen re-released Guns N' Roses first release, the \\"Live like a Suicide\\" (1986) EP along with four new recordings. Together, these eight songs made up Guns N' Roses second album \\"GN'R Lies\\" (1988).<br /><br />\\"Live Like a Suicide\\" had been released one year before \\"Appetite\\" as a way for Geffen to introduce Guns N' Roses to the public. Although it was released under the \\"Uzi Suicide\\" label, that was just a front for Geffen. It was thought that if the EP had been released under an indie label it might have given the band added street cred. And while \\"Live Like a Suicide\\" is supposed to be a live album, that's not really the case. Crowd noise was added to the recordings, to which singer Axl Rose would later decry as \\"contrived.\\"<br /><br />While \\"Live Like a Suicide\\" or \\"side A\\" of \\"GN'R Lies\\" isn't as powerful as AFD, these are still great songs. While they may not have been recorded in front of an audience, they still have a live sound as they don't sound overproduced or have a lot over overdubs. Hopefully, however, one day \\"GN'R Lies\\" will be re-released without the faux crowd noise.<br /><br />The opening \\"Reckless Life,\\" featuring Rose's mightily signature wail and Slash's signature screeching solos, can be seen as a precursor to \\"Welcome to the Jungle.\\"  Rose Tattoo's \\"Nice Boys\\" is another fine hard-rocker and follows nicely. An early GN'R classic and the best song on \\"Live Like a Suicide,\\" the groove-laden swagger of \\"Move to the City\\" has a clear element of vintage Aerosmith. A cover of Aerosmith's \\"Mamma Kin\\" is good, if not great.<br /><br />The second half of \\"GN'R Lies\\" consists of four new acoustic recordings, demonstrating early on how versatile GN'R were. The Izzy Stradlin penned \\"Patience\\" is just plain terrific. A gorgeous balled, it's not overdone or overly sentimental, yet shows a sensitive side to the band none-the-less. \\"Used to Love Her\\" a song about killing your wife/girlfriend is one of the band's more misunderstood songs. As Rose states in \\"Live Era\\" (1999) while introducing the song, it's just a joke, a fantasy.<br /><br />The country-esque \\"Your Crazy\\" is an acoustic version of the same song released a year before on \\"Appetite.\\" While the \\"fast\\" AFD version of \\"Your Crazy\\" is probably the album's weakest song, the slower version on \\"GN'R Lies\\" is one of GN'R best recordings.<br /><br />Guns N' Roses most controversial song, \\"One in a Million\\" closes out the album. This is the song that Axl Rose/Guns N' Roses detractors single-out when they refer to either Rose or Guns N' Roses as racist and/or homophobic. Listening to the song, it's easy to see why the song generated a storm of controversy upon its release. However, to simply condemn Rose and GN'R would be simplistic and a knee-jerk reaction.<br /><br />Does \\"One in a Million\\" have racist, xenophobic and homophobic undertones? Yes. Is Axl Rose a white supremacist that hates gays? No. Essentially, the song is a gritty, honest confessional taken from the perspective of an ignorant young man who has grown up in Indiana his whole life, and upon arriving to LA, has negative experiences with blacks and gays. It's a song from the perspective of how Rose felt at the time and it doesn't reflect his current world-view.<br /><br />Overall, GN'R's \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" and \\"Use Your Illusion I\\" and \\"Use Your Illusion II\\" (both 1991) may be more satisfying than \\"GN'R Lies\\" but this album still contains many gems and is overall a great collection of songs. This CD is also recommended for fans that didn't care for the more artistic leanings of \\"Use Your Illusion\\" but like the rawness of AFD.zy Stradlin penned \\"Patience\\" is just plain terrific.

B000J10EQU|4.0|This film offers a nice follow-up to the first two Superman movies.  Thank God they ignored that crap that passed for Superman III and IV.  I could have done without the prolonged explaination of Lois' son.  That just got a little old after a while.  After about 30 seconds, we all knew whose kid it was.  Spacey steals the show as Lex Luther, but even here, we could have done without the bumbling of his henchmen...a criminal mastermind can't hire better help?  For what it is, it's a good ride.  Superman still delivers.

6304711905|5.0|But he's always your brother and that's the central theme of Tombstone. I was trying to think of a way I could be a little more detached about his movie than I feel like being, but there's no point in trying to do so. The fact is that this is a wonderful film with a wonderful story line and wonderful acting. Val Kilmer's Doc Holliday sucks out all the oxygen in every scene he's in (and even a few where he's off camera). He is devoted to his best friend Wyatt Earp for many reasons but chiefly because he's one of the only friends that he has. Admittedly, this is only a semi-historically accurate portrait of Holliday but the sacrifices he makes for the Earp brothers are touching and admirable. In my mind, the gambler/dentist is the perfect embodiment of loyalty and honor. These are very politically incorrect virtues so we must be thankful that some element of pop culture decided to enshrine them somewhere. Independent of its symbolic and emotional resonance, Tombstone is just a plain old good time. Whatever you want to call it--an action pic, a western or a drama--it's superb and fantastic cinema.
B00005JPFH|5.0|Out of all three Spider-Man movies, this one can only be described as.....  TOTALLY AWESOME!!!  I have absolutely no clue why everyone else hates it, but, no matter.  The special effects were absolutely stunning, the acting was wonderfully convincing, and the villains were the best-conceived out of all three movies.
B0000047CX|5.0|....than this. Some very good albums may define a singer; some great ones, like \\"Tapestry\\" and \\"No Secrets\\", can define a whole generation. Here, we have an album so great we could use it to define \\"music\\".<br /><br />There are conflicting stories as to how this recording, or, at least, Astrud Gilberto's part in it, came to be. At this distance in time, who cares? The late Stan Getz was said to be an unpleasant man. Who cares? He was, you see, a genius, who played the sax like nobody before, or since. Astrud Gilberto supports some political causes that I can't stand. Who cares? She's the prototype of a whole genre...another may be a little prettier, or have a little better voice, but Astrud is still \\"the original\\"; all others are copies. Music and politics shouldn't mix, anyway.<br /><br />Here we have a collection of talent in one place not equaled till \\"The Blues Brothers\\". Besides Getz and Astrud, we have Antonio Carlos Jobim and Astrud's then husband, Joao. Great music, well played, and recorded to perfection. EVERYBODY needs at least one copy of this.
B00000721J|5.0|who cares what John Lennon,the critics,or his peers thought,this was good music and it has stood the test of time as well as the artist.these songs are easy to sing along with and keeps a happy melody in your head.Paul should have went solo long before he did.
B000PFU7OO|4.0|I really really enjoyed the film and though the acting and chemistry was great - it was the music that won me over.<br /><br />Glen Hansard & Marketa Irglova's writing and performing was understated and moving.  Though many of the songs appear on their 2006 disk 'The Swell Season' most people would have missed that (myself included).<br /><br />The disk would be worth it for the first two tracks alone (\\"Falling Slowly\\" , \\"If You Want Me\\"), but the rest of the disk is certainly worth a listen.<br /><br />Overall, the disk has a Damien Rice feel - and that is not horribly surprising considering the Irish busker w/the harmonies coming from a talented female.<br /><br />Though the songs stand alone - folks should really see the movie and how Hansard & Irglova's chemistry really makes the entire thing work.
B000005RT8|3.0|1980's McCartney II was recorded afer McCartney disbanded Wings following his dust-up with Japanese law enforcement.  McCartney played all the instruments and pretty much recorded it himself.  It has a few nice ballads (Waterfalls, Summer's Day Song and One Of These Days) but it is for the most part forgettable.

0553124986|4.0|I remembered seeing this movie as a kid with Cliff Robertson who plays a retarded man named Charly who works in a bakery and is shunned by his mom after his sister is born and his sister. He has an operation and becomes smart for a short period of time. After reading this book, I felt sorry for him because when he was retarded he was treated shabbily and when he was really smart people wouldn't leave him alone. I liked both the boook and the movie a lot. A good story telling of Charlys progress reports, a mouse named Algernon and his story on how his life changed. 4.5 stars
B000GCFO0I|5.0|Spooky with awesome effects, an awesome movie to watch in the dark with surround sound.  If you were a fan of the games you will love this movie also.
B000QFCD5O|3.0|Well, add another half star at least (or don't add anything else, by regarding of the uneven recording), despite of listening to a few \\"oldies\\" from the classic prog/romantic scene (\\"Roundabout\\", \\"In the Court of the K.C.\\" and \\"Fanfare for the common man\\") being a bit strident in comparison to some more commercial/pop hit singles such as \\"Heat of the moment\\" or \\"A Ride easy\\", which could make me change idea about the present reunion...but it's a minor question, because except on a strange execution of the above hits (e.g. \\"Heat of the moment\\", where S. Howe is not completely into the riff and the aggressive guitar sound of his original take of 1981) as well as within their difficult intro of \\"Time again\\" (belonging to a few progressive songs of their debut album here just a bit uneven), the other songs are performed with a good impact, especially by John Wetton, whose voice is almost aligned to his glory days!! I think of a band with such a great experience, even though the set of keyboards used by Downes is not always suitable for their oldies and Steve Howe sometimes seems to be a fish out of water (except on his fine Blues Intersection - even though this latter in their recent concert in Italy at the gig of Asti Festival wasn't so impressive - and of course in the harmonization inside \\"Fanfare for the common man\\" or once again regarding of the best guitar parts within \\"Roundabout\\").Instead Palmer is always a precise drummer (forget a few breaks through only where the whole band is not completely confident) and as usual excellent in his drum solo or once again within the classic instrumental track from \\"Works\\" by ELP.     Long Live Asia!!

This is brilliant and different than any animated film out there.
073933235X|5.0|This book is great. It made me both want to take cooking classes and  sure I never want to be a professional chef. You can't beat the having Anthony read it, either. Highly recommended.
B00005K3NR|5.0|I accidentally bought the re-make version of this movie shopping one evening at Circuit City.  I was livid!  I immediately ordered the original and forgot just how good it was.  Carrie is one of those movies you cna watch over and over again.  The acting is superb and even though you know what will happen - it's good each and every time.  Sissy Spacek never ages and John Travolta truly shows his acting ability.  This is one of my top 5 movies of all times.
0446528056|5.0|How often has the phrase \\"Dear John\\" been written in a letter, talked about over a beer, cried over in the dark of night, or joked about on the television?  Too many times to count, that's for sure.  Sparks, however, has elevated these two simple words to a new level with this novel.  I still have tears in my eyes and an ache in my heart, and I read the last page of the book hours ago.  Sparks has an uncanny knack for delving deep into the psyche of his characters, making you feel everything they are going through, whether physical or emotional.  I was especially moved as I read his take on the Middle East conflict, which John found himself struggling through.  Being a romantic novelist myself, I was rooting for Savannah and John to triumph together in a big finale, and I was caught totally off guard by the astounding ending.  Talk about true love!  If you're a Sparks fan, I'm sure you'll agree that this was one of his finest works, and if you're not a Sparks fan yet, you will be after reading this heart-wrenching story.<br /><br />Joyce Marie Taylor-Author and Poet
B00009ATIX|1.0|This film is an unbearably boring, irritatingly pretentious waste of celluloid.  Were it filmed digitally, it would have been a waste of precious binary code.  It raises rather under-elaborated metaphysical questions about life and death (at a sub-glacial, coma inducing pace) then fails to provide any meaningful message.  After 90 minutes of waiting for something to happen, something actually does, for which I was extremely grateful: the credits rolled.  Video stores should be forced to apply warning stickers to the boxes.
B000301YY8|5.0|I bought this album for one particular song...gee, can you guess which one?  \\"You're Beautiful\\", of course!  I just love his voice and I especially love the sentiment he expresses in this song.  The rest of the songs are good, too, but I was hooked by just the one.<br /><br />Joyce Marie Taylor-Author and Poet
B000OZ2CZW|4.0|With each successive album, Rihanna Fenty has gotten better and better - well, at least where the quality of her material is concerned.  Vocally, the Barbadian beauty is no powerhouse by any means like say Alicia Keys or at her grittiest Beyonc&eacute;, but she fits in fine with dance-pop chanteuses Ciara, Amerie, or the countless others vying for Beyonc&eacute;'s throne (did I really say that?).  I always question myself, after buying all but her first album (which I've heard numerous times), why do I keep buying her when I'm truly a fan of the more soulful R&B chanteuses?  The answer to that question is because Rihanna is infectious, not vocally of course, but she is always good for a couple of strong singles.  From MUSIC OF THE SUN it was the inescapable singles \\"Pon De Replay\\" (which peaked at #2 on the Hot 100) and \\"If It's Lovin' That You Want\\" (peaking in the around #30) on that chart.  From the better A GIRL LIKE ME, Rihanna hit #1 with S.O.S., #6 with my personal favorite \\"Unfaithful\\", charted with \\"We Ride\\", and hit the top 10 once again with \\"Break It Off\\" featuring Sean Paul.  Now, with her best album to date that rids of the annoying tropical flairs of her first two efforts (sure there were some strong tropical numbers, but still), Rihanna hits # 1 with her best, and probably also most annoying song to date, \\"Umbrella\\".  So why do I keep buying Rihanna?  She keeps getting better and better where here hits are concerned. GOOD GIRL GONE BAD aims to really establish Rihanna finally.  The cover art screams it with Rihanna posing in her most suggestive pose as of yet.  Sure, she's fully clothed, but you can't help but notice how the photographer accentuates her curves (can you say, promotion?!?)<br /><br />Anyways, the album opens with the banger \\"Umbrella\\", which is perhaps Rihanna's most solid affair to date as I stated earlier, despite the annoying \\"ella, ella, ellas.\\"  The production is killer, though Jay-Z's rap verse isn't.  I mean come on, who starts a rap with the line \\"no clouds in my storms?\\"  But, the point of Jay-Z's guest spot is to raise Rihanna's profile to superstar status, and judging by the 162,000 copies Rihanna moved her first week, Rihanna is definitely on her way.  The hits keep rolling as Rihanna helms the sexy \\"Push Up On Me\\", one of her sexiest tracks ever.  \\"Please Don't Stop the Music\\" is the perfect minimalist dance track that I'm sure that any dance-diva wished that she could cop from the Barbadian princess.  Even cooler about \\"Please Stop the Music\\" is the fact that it samples Michael Jackson's \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" from his massive THRILLER album. Three hits in a row, the typical Rihanna album.  Does GOOD GIRL GONE BAD break the typical mode? Yes.<br /><br />\\"Breakin' Dishes\\" keeps the dance tracks going as does excellent second single \\"Shut Up and Drive\\".  \\"Hate That I Love You\\", a duet with Ne-Yo, isn't bad, though it sounds like every other Ne-Yo penned song out there.  However, Rihanna sounds especially good here, considering her thin vocals. \\"Say It\\" is solid, while \\"Sell Me Candy\\" is a production standout in the utmost.  \\"Lemme Get That\\" proves to be another work by the genius of Timbaland, the go-to producer for anything.  \\"Lemme Get That\\" proves to be one of my favorites of the album and Rihanna really sells it well.  \\"Rehab\\" finds Rihanna channeling the more serious, and she pulls it off well.  Sure, it isn't as affective (as opposed to effective) as say \\"Unfaithful\\", but it is solid to say the least.  \\"Question Existing\\" is another production standout as all the songs tend to be on this album.  It isn't a bad track either, which leads every fan to believe that Jay-Z and Rihanna really did their research when recording this album.  Final track \\"Good Girl Gone Band\\" is a bit too acoustic-guitar centric, but still pretty solid for the most part.  Again, Rihanna is made to sound great in all of the above mentioned songs, which is a positive thing.<br /><br />Sure, GOOD GIRLGONE BAD is no epiphany by any means (even though it's definitely more of one than T-Pain's album of that name that beat out Rihanna for top honors on the Billboard 200 Album Chart), but it is her very best album to date and definitely her most fun and most listenable affair by a mile.  Finally, Rihanna gets a solid, decisive 4 star review from me.  Keep getting better Rihanna.means (even though it's definitely more of one than T-Pain's album of that name that beat out Rihanna for top honors on the Billboard 200 Album Chart), but it is her very best album to date and definitely her most fun and most listenable affair by a mile.

B00005JMAH|5.0|The third movie in the Harry Potter franchise brings us a new director in the form of Alfonso Cuaron.  While there are some obvious stylistic changes to the movie, it still expertly captures the third book in the series.<br /><br />This year finds Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) facing a personal threat from day one.  Sirius Black (Gary Oldman) has escaped from the wizard prison of Azkaban.  His betrayal led to the deaths of Harry's parents years ago.  Everyone assumes that Black is heading to Hogwarts to kill Harry and avenge You Know Who's death.  Is he out to get Harry?  Will he catch up with our young hero?<br /><br />Naturally, as the books get longer in the series, the films have to cut more out.  This one does a decent job by cutting out most of the Quidditch matches and streamlining the plot.  The plot loses some of the twists and bumps, but it certainly works.  I first saw it without having read the books and really enjoyed it.  Only now that I've read the books do I know the details I was missing.  While they help, they aren't necessary to enjoy the film.<br /><br />Having watched the first three films in such close proximity, I really noticed the difference in the films this time.  If you are paying attention, it's obvious they've changed the setting for Hogwarts.  Even the insides of the castle look different with the Great Hall being less ornate but the halls have many more portraits.  These are minor things and didn't hamper my enjoyment of the film at all.<br /><br />The cast does their normal great job.  All three of our leads are growing into fine young actors.  Michael Gambon takes over the part of Headmaster Dumbledore, and he does a great job.  There is a little difference, but not much.  The special effects are once again amazing.<br /><br />Book purists may be disappointed by the changes made to the story.  But I think you'd hard pressed to find a better film version of this book no matter who was involved.
1594489505|4.0|I loved the story and writing style of the Kite Runner, and it grabbed and held my attention from the very first page!    This story was different.  It was a dark, depressing, and emotional journey.  It was good, but be forwarned that this tale is very sober, sad, and does not carry quite the lightheartedness or richness of the first book.
B000P2A256|3.0|Like many, I have been looking forward to the release of this cd for quite some time.   Perhaps the hype has just made everyone have insane expectations.  This is primarily a \\"prince-esqe\\"  cocktail party cd.  Some of the tracks even border on 80's cheese with Casio Keyboard sampling effects gone over the edge.    The saddest oversight on this album is that the 2003 track, This Woman, from the Spiderman 2 soundtrack is not included.  That is such an amazing song and deserves to be put in the spotlight for the sophomore effort.    All in all, there are a few tracks worth sharing, but just like most overhyped things (as well as chinese food), it goes down to quickly and doesn't leave you full for long!
0143038419|5.0|I read this book in 1-day which is highly unusual for me! Finding one's self in fallout of loss and life change can be hugely challenging; however, it has never been easier to hear about than through the lens Elizabeth Gilbert's experience. I am relieved to find a writer who can probe and explore the physiology of change without leaving their guts and all the un-necessary, often all too boring and redundant details all over the dining room table, or living room floor for that matter. Gilbert is quick, colorful, current, highly entertaining, lucid and thorough as she resolves some very big life questions. If you want to see someone make sense of change, AND move on, read this book. ON the other hand, if you need to experience someone dissecting their depression endlessly, and beating a dead horse you may not be ready for this.
0810993139|5.0|I am always looking for a new book to read aloud to my 5th grade class.  I came across this book, and finished it in 1 day.  I laughed out loud so many times that my 4 year old son came up to me and asked me to read to him what was making me laugh. So I did...he also found some of the pages funny.  This book I feel would be great for reluctant readers because it will grab their attention immediately.
1400063515|3.0|Taleb has an important but rather simple message to deliver. It can be summed up in three words: Rare events happen. That was the point of Fooled by Randomness (which is a better book), and it is the point here.     Once this main point is made (and it is irrefutable), there are any number of embellishments, examples, and explanations that can help the reader round out his or her understanding of the concept. This would be a 5-star book if the author had written it to help the reader understand the basic concept and its implications.     Instead, the book reads like an ego trip. His delivery is maddening. He seems to be filled with anger. The book viciously attacks many well-meaning, competent people in academia, finance, science, and other fields for no apparent reason, other than that they don't see (or agree with) his point.     For that reason, I found the book hard to read. Some reviewers have called it funny; I found no humor in it. Instead, what I found is an author who clearly thinks he is smarter than everyone else and allows that to get in the way of clarity. He seems to take joy in belittling those who \\"outrage\\" him by their stupidity. (Really, what kind of person gets \\"filled with rage\\" over others being unable to see an academic point?)     Another quality that makes this book hard to read is the deliberately opaque way that Taleb chooses to make many of his points. If there is a straightforward way or an obscure way to make a point, he consistently selects the obscure way...using unfamiliar references, saying \\"secundo\\" instead of \\"second,\\" inventing a non-existent author to make a point about book sales rather than choosing a real-life example, and so on. Taleb seems to think such writing is \\"erudition\\" (a quality he clearly admires). I believe that it puts an unfortunate academic-style veil over the book.     I've learned from both of Taleb's books--Fooled by Randomness and this one. I've learned not only the main point--that rare events happen, and they happen more often than we usually expect--but I've also learned something about how not to write. Writing I most admire is deliberately written to be understood, not to get in the way of understanding.
B00005JPHT|5.0|Leave it to cinematic muckraker and agent provocateur Michael Moore to stir up the pot again.  For the third time in less than five years, this renegade has made it his business to take on the powers-that-be on celluloid.  In 2002, it was the gun lobby with BOWLING FOR COLUMBINE; in 2004, it was the Bush cabal in FAHRENHEIT 9/11.  And now with SICKO, he takes on the issue of health insurance, or lack thereof, in America.<br /><br />As Moore himself says at the outset, SICKO isn't necessarily about the fifty million Americans who have no health insurance to begin with.  It is about all the rest of us who do, and who are of the belief that our health insurance carriers will cover the cost of needed drugs or operations, come what may.  But the awful truth about health insurers in particular, and the health care system in general, is that they can deny a claim for any asinine reason to maximize profits.  In essence, this means that every single one of us might be just one illness or one rejected claim away either from financial destitution or, at the very worst, Death itself.  And as always, Moore sardonically goes up against the HMO/pharmaceutical bureaucracy that not only allows this to happen, but also has every elected official in Washington in their pocket so as to make doubly sure that universal health care never becomes a reality in America--brainwashing them, and the American people at large, into thinking of such a system as \\"socialized medicine\\", one step removed from a Commie-like bureaucracy.<br /><br />But piece by piece, Moore shows us the inherent fallacy of such a notion.  First, he shows us a couple of dozen ordinary Americans hit hard by HMOs who will not approve for needed treatment or operations, thus resulting either in bankruptcy or death.  Then he shows how \\"socialized medicine\\" works in Canada, England, and France--quite well, thank you very much: high rates of healthy people; low infant mortality; people who live quite well off; and doctors who don't have to worry about an HMO approving or turning down potentially life-saving treatment, they just DO IT.  What does that say about America, which ranked at #37 on the World Health Organization's list of best health care in the world--just barely ahead of provincial Slovenia?!<br /><br />Then, to add insult to injury (no pun intended), Moore takes several emergency workers who were at Ground Zero on 9/11 to receive treatment outside the U.S., after these workers were told that the treatment they needed either couldn't be done or wouldn't be paid for by the powers-that-be.  And where do they all go?  Cuba--a nation we've had an embargo against since October 1962; a nation whose ruler generations of Americans have learned to despise with every fiber of their being!  And what kind of treatment do these 9/11 heroes get?  The best!  How can one NOT be outraged by the fact that one of the last remaining bastions of the Red Menace can give Americans better health care than their own government?!<br /><br />SICKO, like almost everything Moore has ever done, be it movies or books, has been attacked by the HMO/pharmaceutical complex, whose lobbying power in Washington is exceeded only by the dreaded military/industrial complex.  If it had been only one or two HMO horror stories that made the news in the last twenty years, they might have had a legitimate beef.  But Moore has given us dozens here; and we know of thousands of others--and this includes hospitals dumping indigent patients on L.A.'s Skid Row.  This state of affairs should not be happening here in America, but it is, thanks to the HMOs and the pharmaceutical giants.<br /><br />Yes, what Michael Moore advocates--a universal health care system, presumably funded out of a percentage of our taxes--would mean the collapse of the medical bureaucracy.  But unless we have such a system in place that puts decisions of life and death in the hands of doctors and not political lackeys, being the richest country in the world as we are is going to be negated by us having the worst human rights record in the world.  Health care cannot and should not be a privilege.  As SICKO and its creator so eloquently state, it should be a human RIGHT!s having the worst human rights record in the world.  Health care cannot and should not be a privilege.  As SICKO and its creator so eloquently state, it should be a human RIGHT!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|It is just amazing how BBC manages to produce wildlife documentaries of this calibre time and again.   First of all, you will be amazed to know that there is so much of untouched wilderness still out there. But you will also be saddened to know that there is actually nothing that is truly untouched!   The program is divided geographically and shows you some pretty spectacular shots. The aerial shots, in particular, are absolutely amazing. The limit to which the camera men have gone needs to be seen to be believed.   The image of the snow leopard hunting in thick snow is something that makes me feel privileged! And if you thought you have seen all there is to see about lions, wait till you see this one!   The photography is unbelievable, the sound is awesome, a must watch with the entire family. Certainly a collectors edition.
B0007Y08T2|5.0|What can I say about this band. I have six of there cd's and each one is just as good if not better then the last. The Gallery is a very great cd by them and should not be missed if you can get your hands on it. I won't go into much of the songs becasue really I would just be saying what many other people say.    Just pick this CD up and all there other CD's.
0062515675|2.0|This is an easy afternoon read that is kind of enjoyable at first but gradually starts grinding away at your nerves.  The story is, as another reviewer noted, both shallow and hackneyed....a rich guy has a health scare and changes his life's direction, blah blah blah....    Bottom line is that there are many many better books that will offer you deeper and more lasting insights into personal growth and enlightenment....one's that immediately come to mind are 'Autobiography of a Yoga' or 'Krishnamurti's notebook'. Come to think of it, pretty much anything by Krishnamurti, including his grocery list, is better written than this piece of fluff.    But, to be fair and \\"positive\\", the ideas within are not stupid ones....the problem is that they are blatantly obvious but presented in a breathy and falsely enthusiastic way that suggests that the author is trying (vainly) to turn a molehill into a mountain.     There's nothing wrong with trying to become a more spiritually healthy person, but I recommend that anyone who reads this book continue on to solid authors such as Krishnamurti or Paramahansa Yogananda,  for their works offer much deeper insight into serious life questions.
B000IOM0WY|5.0|I love this movie and I really don't know why so many people are complaining about the quality of the transfer. I thought it was quite good.  Not perfect, but good.  Much better than the standard def DVD upscaled.
B00005MP58|5.0|I'm still not sure why I waited so long to buy this movie -- it sat on my wish list for quite a while until I decided to make the investment. If you read the book and enjoyed it, do yourself a favor and buy this DVD collection! It's almost identical to the novel.  In order to do Austen's work proper justice, a mini-series couldn't have been a better choice. No effort was wasted in the production, and had it been standard film-length, ample character development and some goodies from the novel might have been left out. Everything from the clothing to the music is faithful to the period, and the acting is wonderful. Another plus: the cast isn't nauseatingly full of gorgeous actors and actresses. The characters are believable, true to their literary counterparts, and truly seem like people you might find in the late 1700s/early 1800s. If you can't stand Keira Knightley as Elizabeth, Jennifer Ehle sticks to her role and to the true spirit of Elizabeth. Colin Firth has been the lasting face of Darcy for a reason; he does a remarkable job of conveying the character's personality and complexities.  My only complaints are incredibly nitpicky, but two things nagged me throughout the film. First, Susannah Harker seemed a little too soft-spoken, even if the literary Jane was very gentle. She could have put just a little more 'umph' into her character; her performance felt somewhat lacking. Second -- something which amused instead of bothered me -- Caroline, Bingley's sister, looked like a cross-dresser most of the time. Maybe it's just me, but I hope someone else noticed that as well.  Overall, this movie is an excellent buy, and luckily it's been made to watch in shifts if you can't, or don't feel like, sitting through all six hours in one run.
1591841666|5.0|A quick read but very useful ... Seth Godin gave me a very useful insight with this little book. The \\"winners never quit and quitters never win\\" belief has been reframed !
B0000584V3|5.0|This is the album that first turned me on to Opeth and the first album that gave me a lasting hunger for progressive/experimental/obscure music.  This could truly be the highlight of any music fans' collection.  If you are new to Opeth, I implore you to give the band a chance.  On my first listen of this album I thought that all the songs dragged on for too long, and I hated the harsh vocals; it's amazing how this band has become a member of my favorite band list!  If you need any more convincing, I gave this album to my friend who only listens to bands like The Eagles and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers and he says this is one of his favorite albums!  Okay enough gushing, here's the track-by-track:    \\"The Leper Affinity\\"   I could not have hoped for a better track to start off the album, truly showing the brutality Opeth is capable of.  Cutting right to the chase after the eerie intro, \\"The Leper Affinity\\" pummels the listener with awesome riffs that can't help but send shivers down the spine.  The guitar solo is very fitting for the song as well, nothing too over the top, but it captures the mood.  Then, just as we get used to the harsh side of Opeth, the guitar takes a very harmonic route into the beauty that Opeth is known for.  The listener is then given the pleasure of an incredibly beautiful little passage featuring Mikael Akerfeldt's clean vocals.  Last but not least the song ends with a solo piano piece; they could not have ended the song any better!    \\"Bleak\\"  At first, this track did not impress me too much, but it is now one of my favorites.  As many have said before, the song gives off a very Middle-Eastern vibe, and in my opinion, Akerfeldt's growls could not have been better placed.  The ghostly guitar work in the background is just perfect as well.  After the creepy beginning, the song turns into my favorite aspect of Opeth; the discordant guitar riffs.  This is truly awesome because it takes a lot to turn a seemingly ugly riff into something thatis not only listenable, but surprisingly stunning.  Then the song fades into a more accoustic-driven portion accompanied again by the eerie guitar feedback.  This soothing passage soon comes to a harsh end and the song doesn't take any time bringing you back to the visciousness that it had at the start.  The song comes to a fitting end with the guitar playing alone.    \\"Harvest\\"  As Mikael Akerfeldt describes it, the most beautiful display of guitar follows directly behind the most obscure display.  I could not agree more.  As if Opeth has not already proven that they are more than just a death metal band, they show us why they are different than all of the other death metal bands out there.  Harvest is still my definition of what atmospheric music is.  The song always reminds me of Autmn or Winter when I'm listening to it. It is so easy for anybody to get lost in the melodies of this song; truly a great track.    \\"The Drapery Falls\\"  I've always thought this was the centerpiece of the album, but maybe that is just because this is the first Opeth song I was introduced to.  The opening is so delightfully melancholy and depressing and doesn't lose that feeling when the vocals kick in.  The chords strummed through the accoustic guitar project the utmost feeling of sadness.  After the depressing verse portion, the song turns into a turbulent ode of anger and agression.  This will probably be one of the favorites on the album for new listeners.    \\"The Dirge for November\\"  Not one of the most memorable but I still love the track.  The whole song is not dissimilar to a lullaby, the intro always has stricken me as the beginning of a story about a long sad quest.  When the electric guitars come in is where the song really starts speaking.  If Jimi Hendrix was the first person to make a guitar cry, then Mikael Akerfeldt and Peter Lindgren were the first people to make the guitar utterly weep; they prove beautifully that their are no boundaries to what a guitar can do.    \\"The Funeral Portrait\\"  Oh I adore this song!  The ethereal accoustic guitar opening gives the listener the feeling that something is coming right around the corner; and indeed this is proven true with the extremely catchy riff that soon follows.  I love all the riffing in this song especially at about two minutes into the song, that riff always gives me chills!  I also love that this song is pretty harsh all the way through, it doesn't ever really break in the intensity.  The outro in this song is probably the highlight, I always feel like the song is going in a downward spiral and then ending (and that is not meant to be a negative thing).    \\"Patterns in the Ivy\\"  This short accoustic guitar and piano duet is just awesome and is sort of like an appetizer for the title track, but still its own song.  The piano adds perfectly to the accoustic guitar; this is a very enjoyable little track.    \\"Blackwater Park\\"  Ah yes, the twelve minute title track.  This song encompasses all that is Opeth, from its beautiful melodies to harsh vocals.  The song starts off with a riff that almost requires you to nod your head to the beat.  Then the song starts to get harder and suddenly drops into a very mellow clean guitar passage that lasts for a couple of minutes; some say that it gets too repetitive but I think it is very fitting to the song and does not drag on to me at all.  Then we are launched right back into the heaviness that started out the song.  The guitar solo in this song is also very good, Opeth seems to have a knack for making guitar solos fit the song really well.      Overall I would say this album is easily in my top ten.  I hoped I helped to convince you, because this album is awesome!
0743270754|4.0|Lincoln is probably the most written-about President in American history.  There are massive comprehensive volumes written about his life and presidency.  Goodwin tries to go a different route here -- telling a political history with an emphasis on the dirty dealing and coalition-building that is the real business of politics.    For the most part, the book is succesful.  Lincoln was brilliant in his ability to hold together the shaky Republican coalition.  He worked extremely hard early in his career to build up his credentials and did a good job of holding together his \\"Team of Rivals\\" through the Civil War.  The first part of the book is my favorite as it really gives an impression of what life was really like in the mid-19th century. All of these men lost loved ones to war, disease, childbirth and misfortune.  The 1850's and 60's were one of the most fascinating eras in American history, when the country went from almost universal support of slavery to almost universal opposition, with border states voting away slavery of their own accord by 1865. Lincoln had to ride that sea change in politics and, for the most part, did it well. He himself was part of the change, gradually shedding the racist ideals he supported in the Lincoln-Douglas era.    The only reason I'm not completely sold on the book is that it is a hagiography. To listen to Goodwin, Lincoln never made a mistake, never screwed up and never did anything wrong.  Even sticking with McClellan after he betrayed Pope at Second Bull Run was just good politics! And anything bad that was done -- such as closing down opposition newspapers -- was somebody else's fault.    She ignores or glosses over anything controversial.  I, for one, think the allegation that Lincoln tried to have Justice Tanney arrested is false (it's based on a single witness). But she never even addresses it. Of Bates' defense of the Merryman case, she claims \\"the logic was unanswerable\\" -- despite people answering it for the last 150 years. She glosses over the brutal supression of the draft riots, only mentions arrests of opposition figures and shutting down of newspapers when Lincoln came out looking good.  Does not even address the tyrannical means he used to keep Maryland in the union. Makes only a token gesture to the devastation the war inflicted upon the south.    It is possible to justify these things -- many historians have.  It is not possible to simply ignore them.    Other figures get equally bright halos.  In fact, the only people who come off badly are Mary Lincoln, McClellan and Salmon Chase.    To be honest, I don't understand the hype.  It's a good history book, but not a great one.  The writing style is plain.  But there aren't any new amazing insights.  Like I said, it's a good book if you have an interest in American history and/or the oily machinery of politics.  But there are far better biographies of Lincoln out there.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|I started watching Supernatural when it first began in 2005, and Season 2 has by far exceeded my expectations...It has the wonderful ability to have you on the edge of your seat from start to finish; this is my favorite show EVER!!! I will buy the Season 2 box set the day it comes out....and if you are thinking about purchasing this, I promise this is well worth it, you won't be disappointed!
0141023384|5.0|Things Fall Apart is one of those rare books that if you read it and put in the effort to understand its message, you might just become a better person for it.  What I really liked the most about this book is that it is balanced - Achebe is justifiably critical of European colonialism and the Christian church in his book, but he doesn't get on a soapbox and condemn them as evil.  Achebe offers a balanced view and allows the readers to come to their own conclusions.  As well, while Achebe shows how rich and vibrant the Ibo culture of the novel is, he doesn't shy away from showing its faults.         Of course, while Things Fall Apart is about Africa and colonialism, it is also a fascinating character study.  Okonkwo, the main character of the novel, is as complex, well-sketched and fascinating as anyone in literature.  You likely won't put down the novel liking Okonkwo, but you will definitely respect and admire him.      The language of the novel is wonderful.  It's very simple, but it lends itself to the story quite well.  It often feels like you're reading a story that has been handed down from oral tradition and has finally been committed to paper. Despite a lack of descriptive passages, the novel is quite lucid and will sweep you up into its world of colonial Nigeria.    All in all, an amazing read.  Highly recommended.
0452284937|4.0|I enjoy books where the author successfully transports the reader to another time, and Tracy Chevalier does just that in Girl with a Pearl Earring.  Told in the first person, it is possible to believe that we are the servant girl, Griet, working for the famous painter Johannes Vermeer in 1664.<br /><br />Chevalier takes an actual Vermeer painting, and weaves her story around the painting and the sketchy details about Vermeer's life.  Griet is a young girl whose family has fallen on hard times.  Her father was a painter of Delft tiles, but lost his vision in an accident.  So her parents send her to work for Johannes Vermeer in order to support the family.  Griet is pretty, intelligent and has an artistic eye.  But she soon runs into trouble.  Vermeer's wife takes a disliking to Griet, as does one of his mean-spirited daughters.  Another maid is also extremely jealous of the new domestic.  But Vermeer sees something in the young Griet and he starts using her to assist in his work--a situation that creates even more tension in the Vermeer household.  Chevalier tells the story in an elegant and sensual manner and brings the tale to a nail-biting climax.<br /><br />Girl with a Pearl Earring is my first Tracy Chevalier, but it won't be my last.  In fact, I've already started The Virgin Blue.
B000VNMMQQ|4.0|It has been awhile since the last \\"Die Hard\\" movie, but this enjoyable summer thriller shows the franchise still has a little life left in it. Bruce Willis is surpisingly effective, again, as John McClane, now a lieutenant of detectives in the NYPD, divorced, and trying to run herd on a stubborn teenage daughter.<br /><br />McClane is still a blunt instrument-style cop with a bad habit of turning up at the wrong place at the wrong time. In this case, a cyber attack on computer networks in D.C. prompts a request from the FBI, a quick pickup of a geek computer hacker named Ferrell that turns into a fire fight in a quiet neighborhood in Camden, New Jersey. McClane and Ferrell surive the firefight to discover they are caught up in a cyber \\"firesale\\", designed by disguntled former DoD cyber security genius Thomas Gabriel (played with youthful menace by Timothy Olyphant) to shut down critical infrastructure all along the Eastern Seaboard. McClane and Ferrell (appealingly played by Justin Long) humorously work through a generational cultural gap while figuring out Gabriel's plan.<br /><br />The movie is a series of spectacular and increasingly improbable action sequences stitched together by McClane and Ferrell's pursuit of the bad guys from New Jersey to Washington, D.C. to the Maryland countryside and finally to the Baltimore waterfront. Along the way, McClane's daughter and Ferrell are taken hostage. The final showdown between McClane and Gabriel is in keeping with the traditions of the franchise.<br /><br />The producers were wise to honor the backstory of John McClane; his characteristic mutterings to himself while about to perform some dangerous act will draw knowing laughs from fans of the franchise. The basic storyline is ripped from today's headlines, but the solution in this case is a dinosaur, die-hard cop.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as summer entertainment to fans of \\"Die Hard\\".
B0000025IE|5.0|This was a great review:  \\"This was one of those rare ocasions when everything falls into place to make a masterpiece since the band line-up to the chemistry between band producer, recording company and even the studio chosen to record the album. The result: an unforgetable metal album, one of the best of all times. Raw, simple and diect to the point, but not vulgar or cheap\\"    As a drummer, I loved Dave Hollands pure groove and metronomic timekeeping.  His drum sound was perfect and it stands up today.  The general reviewer who said this recording sounds dated is insane.  This recording is fresh and it comes.    Les Binks was a great drummer as well.  His stuff on Hell Bent for Leather and JP Live in Japan is so underrated.  That guys was a perfectionist and played perfect parts for the songs.  No wasted notes, just brillant drumming.  His drums sound was also great and the double bass work tasty.  Great bass drum sound as well.  The recording back in the 70's is superior to today.  Ya gotta have a great booming Bonham-esq BD sound!    British Steel is perfection and Steeler in mindboggling rock N roll.  The guitar sounds are what metal is about.  BUY THIS CD!    Also, Hell Bent & BS have two of the best looking album covers!
B00005JPHT|4.0|Filmatic Agent Provocateur Michael Moore aims his camera at the sore spot of America's Healthcare System in his latest documentary, \\"Sicko.\\" It's not a pretty sight. The first half of the movie could easily move you to tears, as Moore introduces us to many middle-class, insured citizens for whom the failure of Health Care ended in tragic results. Note that the focus is NOT on the almost 45 million citizens who don't have insurance, but on the citizens who, because they obediently pumped their money into monthly premiums, thought they were protected if things were to turn bad.<br /><br />Moore then finds former workers in the industry who admit their work with regrets, like the caseworker who describes how his job was to turn over as many rocks as possible in your past to make sure your claims could be declined. Or in one case, declined retroactively with a demand that YOU (the patient) make restitution. One of the major differences between \\"Sicko\\" and past Moore ventures, like \\"[[ASIN:B00008DDVV Bowling for Columbine]],\\" is that there are no big name targets here. No CEO is backed into a corner and harangued with a camera. One of the cheif talking heads is little more than an old lion of the British Labour party, Tony Benn, who delivers the quote I used to headline this review (to a loud round of applause in the theater I watched \\"Sicko\\"). Benn and Che Guevara's daughter are maybe the most prominent names here, and that says a lot. This isn't about famous people or Charleton Heston. These are just everyday folks forced into impossible situations with little more than a rubber stamp to mortally wound them - as one very telling news-clip reveals. As such, this becomes some of Moore's best work.<br /><br />But then again, this is a Michael Moore movie, so there has to be some sort of grandstand. It comes when Moore loads a boat of seriously ill people on a trip to Cuba to point out that our \\"9/11 Heroes\\" are getting stuck with treatment worse than that of Al-Qaeda prisoners held in Guantanamo. Even more humiliating is watching how these people, denied all their government help merely because they weren't officially government employees, are left resorting to ticket raffles in the local corner bars of their neighborhoods. (To quote Bill Maher, \\"We call them heroes, but we treat them like chumps.\\")<br /><br />When Reggie, the female 9/11 worker with some sort of inflamed throat/lung issues, discovers that an inhalant that costs her $125 of her disability/SS pay goes for a nickle in Cuba is brought to tears, the obvious propaganda value the Cuban government saw in Moore's presence shakes the honesty of the scene. Which is something of the point...if a country that we despise so deeply and has such internal turmoil can keep a world-class medical system running for all its citizens for free, what then does this say about us? Especially when, in the film's next heartbreaking segment, we are forced to watch a recent silent security camera video of a patient pushed out of a taxi on Los Angeles' Skid Row with little more than a hospital gown because she would not result in a profit?<br /><br />I am one of many people who has medical-care nightmares to relate, none as tragic as those brought to light in Moore's \\"Sicko,\\" but enough to have destroyed my credit rating for several years. When you contrast this to the Health Care employees who recount that they were given bonus incentives for the number of claims they denied (as opposed to the English Doctors who are given incentives for the number of patients they cure) and the amounts of money shown paid to Health Care CEOs, \\"Sicko\\" will make you think twice about that lingering queasiness viewing this movie can cause.antanamo.

0743454537|5.0|This was my first Jodi Picoult novel, and i will DEFINETLY read another one of her books. My Sisters Keeper was one of those books you just couldnt put down. Very well written and drew out every emotion in the reader. The jaw-dropping ending was a little disappointing, but at the same time, i get it. Kleenex alert, this one is a tear jerker. Especially if you are a mother. Excellent book!!
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I love how HD-DVD fanboys try to ruin a review section of a blu-ray movie with garbage. This movie will look good regardless of what format its on. It will look the same on both HD-DVD and Blu-ray. I'v seen 300 at the theater and couldn't wait until it hit a hidef format because I know it will look good.
1400032717|5.0|This novel brings the reader right into the world and thought process of the main character. It reads less like a detective novel (to which the reviews seem to have tied it down with) and more as a character analysis of autism. The pages fly by, not in an attempt to solve who-dunit, but to find out what will be said or done next. An entire universe of logic unfolds that the adult mind has trouble understanding, and yet Mark Haddon has used his years of experience to bring forward a very memorable literary character. I found the solution to the murder mystery slightly out of flow with the rest of the novel (as well as out of character) but it did not lessen my overall enjoyment.
B00005JPHT|5.0|Does the U.S. have some of the worst health care in the world? Could it be that the \\"land of the free\\" ranks #37 concerning health care just above Slovenia? Do insurance companies \\"weed out\\" those that they predetermine to not cover? Have important politicians, who a few years back supported a move to socialized medicine in this country,been \\"bought\\" in order to have this put on the back burner? Why am I paying a $30 copay for the same medicine that last year cost me $10??? Why do some people get approved for medical procedures and others do not? Thank you Michael Moore for finally bringing these questions to the attention of a sleeping American public. If his facts are only 50% correct, then we are still in big trouble and deserve alot of explanation. DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS are both held equally responsible for this mess in Michael Moore's film, so no one should, whatever their politics,  avoid seeing this film.This is good information that equally effects all of us as Americans.Yes, I laughed and I cried as well.Yes I was entertained. Ultimately I left feeling low and concerned. I do have health coverage and stay at a dead-end job because of it,too.It would be nice to have this paid for so that I could do what I really wanted to do.As you get older in the U.S. you realize that benefits, for what they are, are essential to survival.How sad for us!God help anyone who has a catastrophic illness with no coverage. It's frightening.Are other countries panaceas? Watch the film and you decide!<br /><br />Two great movies to follow up SICKO would be  1990's THE DOCTOR with William Hurt and BEAUTIFUL DREAMERS with Colm Feore.These films were released as socialized medicine was becoming an issue under Clinton.
B00005JPHT|4.0|Moore's latest film Sicko, like all of his films is highly entertaining, very watchable and humorous, while at the same time taking a serious look at a troubling situation. It is important to remember however that Mr. Moore has his own agenda and opposing views are always made to look ridiculous and stupid in his films. The Canadian healthcare system which he lauds is not the panacea that he makes it out to be. Canadians wait months for necessary operations and many end up coming to the states in order not to die while on the waiting lists in Canada. Additionally, the social welfare states of Great Britain and France in addition to Canada, tax their citizens at a much high rate than in the USA. Average working people in those countries are taxed at least at a 40% rate in order to pay for all of those services. The issues Moore raises are legitimate and worth a lot of discussion. I thoroughly enjoyed his film, highly recommend it to others, but remind viewers to keep asking questions.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I thought it would be tough to top Lullabyes to Paralyze or Songs for the Deaf, but they have done it with Era Vulgaris. This is an album that needs to be listened to as a whole, each song flows so well into the next. You need many listens to appreciate this, so give it a few more listens.
1400079179|2.0|The Da Vinci Code is a decent book, and I've to commend anyone who questions religion (although Brown's really just criticizing religious authorities in this case). The story is slow and repeats info, but at least there is a story. I don't believe Brown's version of history, though, just as I don't believer any religion's.
B000MTDRKE|4.0|Neal Morse for a long time now has struck me as a musical genious.  Just recently above all his album ? has certainly struck me genious and my favorite.  Aside from that when I picked up Neal Morses' new Sola Scriptura and put it in to listen to, I was blown away to find that the musical genious still layed in layers of smartness, cleverness, and pure thrill of a good listen.  The only thing I had wrong with the album was the cliche lyrics.  As good as the spirituality is, this lyrical mesh didn't strike me as deep as the other three genious albums he's released.  I try my hardest not to compare to other albums, but when you know his lyrical topics and writings could be better, it's hard to listen to the words... so that's why I listen to the music.    If your looking for a good rock fused metal with some symphonic influence baried deep in the heavy goodness, you'll find yourself quite satisfied with the movements of these few songs.  Plus you'll get a good half an hour song to enjoy on your free time.  I've always been a person to love long songs, and these did not disapoint me in the least.  Per say, I'm quite in love with the motion of these songs.  The door is really the only song on this album I had a hard time with, it's a good song, but not to the bestest lyrical quality right, but the music is still in the highest motion of pure entertainment.  However, in this goodness of rock fused metal, you will find that the riffs are hard and the transitions are top notch.  Also, the complexity of the song remains to the truest of Neal Morses standards, plus not to include Portnoy's (Dream Theater) backing, with a bit of Rudess (Dream Theater as well) and our favorite bass guitarist.  Anywho, I would recommend this to anyone whose looking for some awsome rock, incredible intricate melodies/movements/riffs, and just enjoys longs songs that take you on a wonderful adventure through the theological mind of Morse.  This is for any prog rock lover, but also a generic rock fan who doesn't mind a song exceeding 5 minutes, let alone 25 minutes.  So however you'd like to do that, enjoy its simplicity, not, enjoy its complexity very much.  4 stars to another successful album.
B00005PJ6M|3.0|This time around bad guys from the future want Bill & Ted dead so there's no peace in the future. They create robot Bill & Ted's to kill them and take their place to make them look bad. They succeed in killing them and Bill & Ted then meet Death (William Sadler from Die Hard 2) who brings them to hell. There they have to relive some of their worse memories in a scene that's more haunting and cool than it is funny.<br /><br />  The laughs come when they have to compete with Death in a bunch of different board games. It's supposed to be that if they beat him in one they can leave but since he's a sore loser he makes them verse him in a few different games before he gives in. The scene works since the under-rated Sadler is in good form as Death and the best reason to see this movie. The scene where Bill and Ted possess police officers gets some laughs as well though. I loved the first one as a kid but trying to get into it now can be hard since it's a bit more corny. The corniest thing about this one is the ending but otherwise it's a good looking film that's also pretty fun.
B000P6YNSE|5.0|This is probably the best and deepest show to ever have been on tv. You have to study this show, read other books that show up in the form of easter eggs and watch each episode at least 3 times to really get it. This show asks philosophical questions and uses elements from the bible, Alice in Wonderland, the Wizard of Oz and a thousand other influences to give us that rare show that will fuel imaginations for generations to come.     That all being said we are only a little over half way through. With 3 more seasons (16 episodes each) to go, this season gave us many of the answers about the characters. It told us how Locke lost his ability to walk, who the real Sawyer was and how Benjamin Linus got to the island to name a few. We also had a glimpse of the mysterious Jacob but most intriguing of all is the idea that the bad guys are in fact the good guys, at least in comparison to this other enemy that has been looking for the island from the beginning.     It's quite a show. I don't feel it dipped in quality at all, but things were certainly set up for some big pays off at the end of this season. There is no question that if you are a fan of this show you have to pick this DVD set up. You have to study each episode so that you get the big picture.     So now that the writers have a definite timeline there is little question that each proceeding episode will be a step towards some answers from here on out. But remember Lost is like a long novel like the Stand. If you stopped reading the Stand when you thought it was getting boring then you cheated yourself out of a great book and would not have later realized that it was all important. It's the same with Lost.
B00005JPQP|3.0|I'm not sure if anyone wanted another film after 0cean's 12. It was hard to follow with too much camera movements and handheld camera usesage. Ocean's 13 is about as slick and cool as the original though. The gang rejoin to hit a greedy Casino owner's new Casino. He's played by Al Pacino  who ripped off one of their own played by Elliott Gould. Gould doesn't take it too well, infact it almost kills him. So the gang is back but for revenge this time around. It's not a thick plot but it's more of a plot than Ocean's 12 had anyway.<br /><br />  Everyone is back from the original but Julia Roberts and I think her character is just mentioned by Brad Pitt once but not by name. The film is entertaining enough to easily forget about her though. It's stylish and cool and yes there's some good laughs as well. What's funnier and interesting than the actual robbery is them doing everything they can to make sure the new hotel/Casino gets rated bad. They do this by making the guy who rates the place stay there horrible in anyway they can. It's also pretty funny how Clooney watches Opera and gets teared up when a house is built for a family on her show. The film wasn't needed that much but this time it's just not the cast that's having a good time like with Ocean's 12. The movie isn't fantastic but it's enjoyable and fun enough to recommend.
B000002AGE|4.0|And so is the incredible Jaco Pastorius on his fret-less electric base.  Really, the only sub-par track on this CD is the very short Rumba Mama.
6304698623|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching this movie, set in nineteenth century America.  Lisel Matthews renders a stirring performance as the only daughter of a wealthy military officer. Spirited, intelligent, and highly imaginative, Sara Crewe must deal with living in a foreign country,(her native country is India), adapting to a strict school run by stern school marme Miss Minchin (Eleanor Bron),and handling the deployment of her father, whom she loves dearly, into active combat during WW2. How Sarah manages, while keeping her humor and her dignity is what makes this revised version so enjoyable. I actually enjoyed it more than the original, starring Shirley Temple(1939). But the best reason for watching it, is the message it has infused into my daughters psyches', the idea that they are both princesses! This is a true classic.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|...still not quite on par with her debut, \\"Come Away With Me\\" which was pretty much flawless.  \\"Feels Like Home\\" was about 30% good, this one is closer to 60-70% which is really about all you can ask for in most albums.<br /><br />\\"Sinkin' Soon\\" was by far the best cut, with a gorgeous horn section...has the sort of gleefully dark energy often found in Eastern European music.<br /><br />The songs I didn't like were the rather bland numbers, such as the first track, \\"Wish I Could\\"---but there was nothing outright unlistenable on this CD, which is a huge improvement over Norah's second album.
B000PWQOAI|5.0|This Japanese mini-lp replica version of Ozzy Osbourne's best album is simply a work of art! Very beautifully designed with all the lyrics included and with a sound quality remastered to perfection. There are true classics as \\"Over the Mountain\\", \\"Flying High Again\\", \\"You Can't Kill Rock and Roll\\", and \\"Diary of a Madman\\" of course.       This is by far the best version of this album that is out there; great sound quality, great packaging, great songs! A must have in any CD collector's library.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|It would be difficult for her to top Breakaway, which was one of my favorite albums of the decade, the title track, especially. I generally prefer her softer songs, though I think it's good that she's trying to break out of the American Idol mold and write her own songs. This album is very honest, though a bit angry, and her voice is sounding as good as ever. Out of the rock songs, \\"Judas\\" is the most radio-friendly, and \\"Never Again\\" is steadily growing on me. But I think she should have tried \\"Be Still\\" as the first single, a real standout acoustic ballad, and \\"Irvine\\" is great, on that one her vocals remind me a bit of Dusty Springfield, and she's one of the few singers that can effortlessly swing between country, rock, R&B and pop ballads. This album deserves a shot to succeed in its own right indepedently of \\"Breakaway\\" but it will take some getting used to.
B000PWQOB2|5.0|This Japanese mini-lp replica version of Ozzy Osbourne's best album is simply a work of art!

0316776963|5.0|This was the first work that I read by Sedaris.  I actually listened to the audio version first which is narrated by him.  I immediately bought everything else he had written.  I laughed I cried and I don't doubt that you will too.  BUY THIS BOOK!
1582701709|3.0|The focus is so much on materialism and it also makes things into an all or nothing situation. For example, if you really really focus on being successful you will. And the over emphasis on material. There is a certain amount of free will that man has. But Warren Buffet one of the wealthiest men of our time said it himself. His quote is something like this... I may be rich but only becuase I live in this country. If I grew up somewhere else and had the talent I do it would be meaningless.<br /><br />There is no doubt a lot of talent to the successful business people. They have minds that are designed for this type of success. And none really need the college they had. As for Drs. and engineers etc. They can achieve success by studying hard etc. The bottom line, we must renew our positive thinking as much as possible, but also realize that failure often times is just part of our life journey.<br /><br />The person who jumped into a lake at 20 (and became quadroplegic because of this) who I know who has not moved most of his body in over 24 year did not wish that on himself. He made one simple mistake. If you can take the message of positive thinking from the movie and let go of the rest, then you have a 5 star production. If you want the reality of the film. Its a 2-3 star production, with much too much materialistic focus.
B000002NJS|5.0|Truly. After hearing this Album I can say I felt enlightened. It's true that \\"Ray Of Light\\" is one of Madonna's best pieces of Music since \\"Like A Prayer\\". It's spiritual like it's pedecessoer 9 years before, but in a different way. While \\"Prayer\\" focuses on her Christian or catholic faith, \\"Light\\" focused more on M's New Religion. Kaballah. The sound of this album is very Hindu and Asian sounding. Overall \\"Prayer\\" was more religious, but \\"ROL\\" is definetly more spiritual, and overall more enlightening.     The Album opens with very liquid, watery sounds, hence the First tracks title \\"Drowned World\\". It doesn't get the album off to a cracking or even energetic start, but it does set the tone for things to come. It's a half decent track, but it does it's job of relaxing you and clearing your mind.    Up next is a similar, but more tropical sounding track called \\"Swim\\". This song like the previous is very calming, but feels warmer than Drowned World. It has a message of salvation. \\"Night is getting colder. sometimes life feels like it's a curse. We can't carry these sins on our backs. Don't wanna carry anymore. Were gonna carry this train of the track. gonna swim to the ocean floor\\". Overall this song is very hypnotic, and calming. A good song to play if you're stressed.    next we are thrown from a surreal, watery world into a world of pulsing dance beats, and techno vibes. YEAH. IT'S THE TITLE TRACK. YOU'VE HEARD THIS ONE - it's One you can dance to. Very energetic, and a feel good song.    \\"Candy Perfume Girl\\" is up next, and while not one of the album's best tracks it's nothing worth skipping. Like \\"Swim\\" it's very hypnotic and INDIE sounding. Pretty cool song, and different from anything she had done before.     Number 5 is a Techno trance song called \\"Skin\\". It's easily one of the Album's best, and most energetic songs. Definetly one of my faves. It's very strange, but it has a lot of artistry to it and is very enjoyable. It has some of the best lyrics on the album.    \\"Nothing Really Matters\\" is a dance song from the album, and once again is not the typical Madonna we were used to before ROL came along, but it is a very good club song, and has a great beat. Also some great instrumental parts. Once again the songs message is about salvation and being saved. \\"Nothing takes the past away like the future. Nothing makes the darkness go like the light. You're shelter from the storm. Give me comfort in your arms\\".    \\"Sky Fits Heaven\\" is probably THE albums BEST song. Surprisingly it wasnt a single, but could have been. It's a sonic techno track, and is pure energy at it's best. An Energetic awesome dance beat mixed with great lyrics....\\"Traveling down this road. Watching the signs as I go. I think i'll follow my heart, It's a very good place to start\\".    A song sung entirely in Sanskrit(an ancient indian language) is up next. it's called \\"Shanti/Ashtangi\\". Though I didn't understand this track I was fascinated with it. It is VERY Hindu sounding, and has a lot of Asian culture to it. Overall I think it's one of the albums best songs.    \\"Frozen\\" is one of my Favourite songs from the Album. it's message is to let Love kill all your fears and hate, because as long as you hold onto them you're Frozen as a person. The Lyrics are very true, and this song has a great message. I love the Hindu sounds once again, and the Indian chants she does. It's like being in a temple. this song also had an awesome video, where Madonna is seen floating above the mojive desert.    \\"Power Of Goodbye\\" is one of the Albums ballads, and is very good. I think the message is no matter how bad things are in your life you can always escape, because nothing goes on forever. It's like saying goodbye to your troubles.    \\"To have, and not to hold\\" is a mid tempo hindu sounding song. It's about longing to have someone, but they won't let you get close enough to them. It's mediocre at best, but still enjoyable.    \\"Little Star\\" is a pretty song about her new born daughter Lourdes. It's a very sweet mid tempo dance track. It has some spiritual lyrics. \\"God gave a present to me. Made of Flesh and Bones. My Life. My Soul. You make my Spirit Whole\\". It's a sweet song.    You could think of the Album's closer \\"Mer Girl\\" as this Album's own version of \\"Promise To Try\\". It's about Madonna's mother, but unlike 1989's \\"Promise To Try\\" it's a much darker, colder song. It's the Albums most Haunting track, and the most terrfying track Madonna will probably ever do. Some people say this was not a good track to close the Album on, and something more enlightening should have been chosen, or even that this track should have been left off the Album completely. But I think it's a great song. In my oppinion the Albums most fascenating track.   The Album ends with the lyrics \\"I smelled her flesh. Her Rotting bones. Her decay. I ran. And I Ran. I'm still running Away.......    The Japanese Import version of this album, has an amazing bonus track - \\"Has To Be\\". It's worth the money for that 1 track alone.
0743289412|3.0|I am surprised at the fact that apparently Simon and Schuster/Doubleday/Macmillan/Scribner doesn't feel that they have to actually do any editing of such a master writer as Stephen King. They should reconsider that thought.<br />A full 35% of this book could have been edited out without effecting the story one bit, although then I wouldn't have slept so much.<br />I hope with the next novel Mr. King will stick to a cohesive story and not drive off into the back-country looking for more pages to fill just for the sake of making his book longer.<br />I have loved all of his books (except Gerald's Game which was also similarly overly wordy/boring for a good portion). I was hoping that this might turn out to be another Rose Madder, but the only similarity I found was that the more I read, the madder I rose.<br />Better luck next time.

B000J4OYRW|5.0|Watched it three times in the course of the first week I owned it. What can I say? We follow Neil and Chris through their childhoods, into the period when they met each other, and follow them through each album.  Inciteful and fun, we see the concepts behind each PSB release, including projects they did for other artists like Liza MInnelli and Dusty Springfield.  The film takes us right through their musical \\"Closer to heaven\\", the performance of \\"Battleship Potemkin\\", and their latest album \\"Fundamental\\"... right up to today basically!  Includes commentary by Liza Minnelli, Brandon Flowers of the Killers, Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters, Bruce Weber, and of course, a lengthy interview with both Boys.  Fabulous for any Petheads collection.
0393327655|4.0|As an ex-born again Christian, I'd often heard much said about this book but tended to dismiss it because I thought that the recent trend of blaming \\"religion\\" for just about everything that is wrong in the world to be a gross and narrow oversimplification.  Nevertheless, I saw this book on the shelves one day and decided to read the first couple of pages.  I did.  And then I read the next couple of pages.  And then the next few.  After fifty pages of straight reading in the bookstore, I took it to the front and happily put thirteen dollars on the counter.<br /><br />Refereshingly, Harris generally writes with the assumption that the reader is not a follower of any specific dogma, so no time is redundantly wasted debunking nonsense like Intelligent Design. Harris instead crafts an explosive(pun intended) introduction that will have you hooked from the first page all the way to the end of the first chapter, in which he drops the bombshell that its not the Bible-thumping, gay-bashing, abortion clinic-bombing Christians who are the biggest obstacle to progress in the Western world, but instead the alleged victims of contemporary religious backlash: Christian moderates.  In a maneuver truly so simple that it's almost unsettling, Harris proves that Christian moderate-belief is not only irrelevant to unbelievers, but to their own scriptures which they supposedly deem Holy, and the only role moderates now play is to act as a shield against alleged stereotyping of religious intolerance.<br /><br />Expansion on this knowledge and possible solutions to alter the mindset of the American landscape towards moderates could have carried the entire book, but frustratingly, Harris abruptly abandons this angle and moves on to a second chapter about the nature of belief.  The chapter is almost deceptively elementary, as Harris builds a serious of logical and almost blindingly obvious arguments about the nature of belief and how it fuels our actions, then in an effective tactic, suddenly juxtaposes blind faith against these basic principles, against which they truly look foolish.<br /><br />Harris moves on to document the history of religious intolerance and describes in detail middle-age executions which can only be described, at the very least, as barbaric. Effectively illustrating , thanks to scientific understanding of natural phenomena, how far humanity has come as a society.<br /><br />Harris then moves to tackle Islam and Christianity in specific chapters.  Of them, the Islam chapter is by far the longer of the two, but more importantly, parts of it are genuinely terrifying.  The chapter on Christianity is not nearly as pressing, as Harris struggles just to fill just thirteen pages of why Christianity is an impedement to progress in America. However, having accepted Harris's earlier assertion that Christian moderate are truly irrelevant, virtually all of it rings true.  Others might not be so easily convinced that the defeat of stem cell research and monuments of the Ten Commandments in courthouses are reasonable justification for eradicating religion entirely in America.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the last three chapters primarily deal with the fledgling science of the human brain, of which Harris is now a student, and our sense of \\"self\\".  In an afterword, Harris reveals he has been accused by many of making The End of Faith a trojan horse for championing \\"New-Age mysticism\\".  I don't believe that was his intention, but that doesn't change the fact that alot of this isn't especially relevant to the promised titular subject matter.  Ultimately, these chapters don't detract from the quality of the earlier chapters, but in a sense do mislead the buyer in the sense that he may find that \\"real\\" book is only half as long as he or she had hoped.<br /><br />Whereas I found The God Delusion to be a self-indulgent and really ultimately pointless circular rant, Sam Harris's The End of Faith is instead a relevant look at the unfortunate truth that blind faith still plays a huge, and in the case of Islam, extremely dangerous role in our world.  As Harris asserts in frighteningly eloquent and ironic fashion, if many among us don't intellectually open their eyes to truths(or non-truths) about our world, we may find that the prophecies of the Book of Revelation come true sooner than we hope.e case of Islam, extremely dangerous role in our world.

B000OCXMAE|1.0|I used to be a big fan, I have all their albums and all prior to this were really good. I was very disappointed after listening to Minutes to Midnight. It does not sound like Linkin Park, especially track 3 and track 5 and the list goes on, which sounds like a pop teen boy band type of song (like backstreet boys). This is the the worst CD I have ever heard next to the new Fall Out Boy - Infinity On High. They are both so lame and sound nothing like what you would expect. Linkin Park should have retired if this is the type of music they plan to produce. They have ruined their good reputation.<br /><br />I almost forgot to mention that they often use obscene language in places where it simply does not fit the song. It is totally uncalled for, maybe they think it makes them sound \\"cool\\" but it actually sounds so lame. They sing like new kids under peer pressure trying to sound \\"cool\\" to fit in. What a shame!
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|Kelly's new album is okay at best. It sounds sort of like Avril Lavigne, who is not half the singer Kelly is. I understand her wanting to write her own stuff and move on but there are alot of bad songs on this CD. \\"Sober\\" is the best song by far. I think it's one of those cd's you have to listen to alot to appreciate. I'm trying but I don't think I'll ever like it as much as \\"breakaway.\\"
B000059XXZ|5.0|Well, I've had this tape for a couple of years and just got finished watching it half an hour ago for probably the third time.  I'd have to say (because I still find it interesting) that constitutes the movie being art.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1.  Ok writing, that's a star.<br />2.  Ok acting and at times a little better, that's a star.<br />3.  Ok directing and that's a star.<br />4.  Neat idea handle ok, sometimes better.  That's another star.<br />5.  Neat modeling, music (for the Batman scenes) right on target, that's a star.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1.  The truth is, I and anybody else could pick this and most movies apart and suggest changes, additions, subtractions or out and right distruction or run it up the flag pole and see who salutes.  In this case it is a popcorn movie and not to be take as serious as Casablanca.  Therefore I see no reason to chop or pick it apart.  The only real question is, is Batman entertaining?  Was it interesting enough to see a couple more times?  If so, then it did its duty enough to be called art, (provided it is original).<br /><br />Batman is art.  It isn't on the same level as Casablanca, but what is!  It's a popcorn movie and because it came out, and had such a big reception, the industry tried to make other Batman type and style movies.<br /><br />My favorite scenes?  Fast-forward until the girl gets into the Batmobile<br />and watch that thunderbolt go down the road progressively faster, and the music was perfect for that scene.  I think the scene should have lasted another ten to twenty seconds longer and the Batmobile should have gotten progressively even faster.  But in the beginning, when they were driving through the forest road (with all the fallen leaves) it looked as if they were only going fourty miles per hour.  (I know it was only a gas powered model).  By the time they hit that last stretch the Batmobile couldn't have been doing over 100.  I know that's fast even for a model in scale miles per hour BUT...well, its is a jet powered car.  You know a real race car at the Indie 500 start off at 200 mph just to qualify.  The Batmobile is Jet powered...and it's just a model and just a movie...I wish you guys had--you know--got it up there where a bowshock pressure wave had been visible.<br /><br />Oh well, so what.<br /><br />I still like the movie despite a few flaws. The Joker gave a fine performance no matter what anybody says, and the other Jack played his part well--Palance always has (I hope I spelled that right).  So, I give this popcorn popper a five star rating and recommend it to all of us who still haven't sold out our taste.<br /><br />One last thing...the real Batman never kills.<br /><br />Bye!die 500 start off at 200 mph just to qualify.

B000FTWB7G|5.0|Evanescence has changed, and this album is as good as their first, if not better. Completely different, The Open Door is a fresh undertaking from a band we already knew was great. Now, Amy Lee's voice is back after a much-awaited 3+ years and it falls over you at times like a gentle black rain, or crashes into you like the jagged leading edge of an approaching storm. I don't like \\"female rockers\\" as a rule, but Amy Lee has what it takes to make my skin tingle - in a good way.    So many songs on this album, and every one is great and completely different. I love the piano melodies intertwined with the driving, heavy guitar chords. I have heard Evanescence compared to Linkin Park, and while that may be technically true, the similarity stops at the tempo of the music for me. Amy Lee and Evanescence evoke so much more emotion in me than LP, although I like them as well.    Amy Lee is obviously the center of the band now, as several others have already stated, but the rest of the band is still a force to be reckoned with. I do miss the \\"duets\\", however few they were on Fallen, but Evanescence has evolved into a much deeper band; much more emotional with Lee's vocals of course; and I can't wait for another album. Fallen has now made it back into my regular listening rounds because of The Open Door. I bought this album because of Call Me When You're Sober, but I was very satisfied that it was not the best song by far on here.    I'll leave the song-by-song reviews to those who do them so much better than I. I will say that there just isn't a bad song on here, or even one that I don't like as much as the others. I could listen to Amy Lee serenade me all day long. It makes me want to cry, to hold her, and then just listen and bask in the raw power of it. I'm a fan for life.    Keep up the good work guys!! All of you make it all worth while. I live for music and couldn't imagine a life without it. This world would be a much sorrier place indeed without great music.

0385522401|5.0|A true gem to be read in a day or two, a few hours even, but one that will stay with you and change your life forever.  Two wonderful but quite different young people meet in 61, fall deeply in love and marry a year later.   It's their wedding night as the drama unfolds. Too many things had been left unsaid. Misunderstandings and disappointment get in the way of what could have become a wonderful life.  With marvellous prose, beautiful tender images, mister McEwan tells a story nobody will ever be able to forget.
1594489505|5.0|I have never read a novel that actually moved me to tears...this book is an experience, to say the least!  I HOPE this author writes more and more books.

0618680004|5.0|It seems that an overwhelming number of people who have reviewed this book think that it is no value because theologians will just dismiss it and athiests don't need it.   Well, wake up people.  There are a huge number of people who really don't know what to believe.  If, like me, you spent a large portion of your life bouncing back and forth between the two camps, this book will unblock your mind.  If you labour under the impression that you are agnostic, or you've found yourself borrowing books on Buddhism from the library, it's time to get a copy of this book.  Who knew that facing reality can actually give you the comfort you seek?    One other criticsm that is levelled against this book it that it advocates fundamentalist atheism.  I disagree.  I believe that it proposes fundamentalist \\"open-mindedness\\".  Pick up a history book (read Larry Gonick's Cartoon History of the Universe if you generally find history boring) and look at how much hurt and suffering has been caused on humanity in the name of religion.  If we all did what this book advocates and let our children make up their own minds when they reach adulthood human kind will finally be free to focus on its greatest challenge; surviving to the next century.
B00005JPLW|5.0|Clearly, you can never go wrong with something that came out of Frank Miller's head.  I thoroughly enjoyed this film, from the mesmerizing effects to the wonderful display of muscles, especially those of Gerard Butler.  Anyway, the whole point of this film is sheer entertainment, it is no ridiculous, long epic like Alexander or Troy, it is simply non-stop, fast-paced action that will keep your attention.  Wonderfully cast, excellent score, excellent everything.  Nice job Mr. Snyder, hope to see more good things from you in the future.
B000002AGN|5.0|This Cd is just GREAT and such a Jazz classic! The re-mastered version of this Album is absolutely wonderful---sounding so crisp and sharp!<br /><br />The songs speak for themselves, as they are some of Brubeck's most famous hits.<br /><br />This is a highly recommended re-mastered version of Dave's TIME OUT Album!
B000BCKFWK|4.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  There is a short list of DVDs that I own which infinitely keep my attention, and Sin City is one of those I can watch three or four times in a row and not get bored.  I am only giving this DVD set 4 stars however, only because there is no option to watch all the uncut parts together in full length.  I kind of understand why the DVD was put together like this but it would have been nice to see the whole thing cut together so we can watch it beginning to end with all the added scenes integrated.  Obviously it's good to have the full disc with the original cut, and this is the one I generally watch but it was great to see the uncut scenes as well.  The added graphic novel to the box set was a nice touch as well.  5 stars for the film, but 4 for this edition.  Overall a thoroughly enjoyable experience.
0385338686|4.0|This book wasn't nearly as strong as what I've read from Kinsella in the Shopaholic series. I really enjoyed parts of it, but the indecision in the character of Samantha for the last fifty pages was just annoying. Read Shopaholic books before you pick up this one!
B00020HEG6|5.0|All the spirit of Harry Potter is here, but also the magic of a mysterious, dark, gothic Hogwarts, the stormy sky, the loneliness of a wild and mountainous landscape. The score is inventive. We can feel the highly medieval spirit of Hogwarts with \\"Double Trouble\\" and \\"Hagrid the Professor\\" or \\"The Portrait Gallery\\" for example, but above all, magic and real emotions. The music is beautiful. In my opinion, it's the best Harry Potter score. John Williams really has an immense talent. This score is a real gem. It's a MUST-HAVE.
B00005NVDF|4.0|Play It Again, Sam, written by and starring Woody Allen is just plain hilarious.  Full of sight gags and tremendous one-liners, this is Woody at his \\"slapstick\\" funniest.  Diane Keaton is great as Woody's friend and advisor.  They have an excellent chemistry.  The movie takes place in San Francisco, and is full of excellent imagery.  Fun and fast-paced, this is a 4 star Woody Allen film well-worth the minor time investment (85 minutes).
0767812166|5.0|This film works on many levels.  The cast is engaging, the plot is suspenseful and dotted with humor, the musical score is hauntingly beautiful, the themes are uplifting and the symbolic meanings are mythic.  Why not more films about human goodness and being at our best when things are at their worst?
1400032717|4.0|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, by Mark Haddon, features a nifty little mystery that is, in of itself, fun to follow.  The true scope of this book is with its excellent insight into Autism.  The main character in this very enjoyable book is Autistic.  The battles he must wage just to answer the questions involved in the mystery make for the most compelling aspect of this book.  A great read.  4 strong stars.  This book is not to be missed.
B000P28R8K|5.0|One of his best late-period records -- anyone care to argue whether Earthling is a Bowie album or the third Tin Machine release? -- made more compelling by the guitar work of David Torn, a terrific cover of one of the better Pixies songs, Major Tom's wanking twin, a Saul-Bellowish short-story set to music and the sort of track to track coherence of the Early Days. It's enough to make you forgive and forget \\"Let's Dance\\"!<br /><br />This package may  be pretty highly priced, but the \\"bonus\\" disc does include work not present in the previous and original \\"limited edition\\" which remains available still. (What are the \\"limits\\" exactly?) But all the additions aside (The word \\"extras\\" seems inappropriate -- it's like saying \\"extra money\\". Be honest, is there such a thing?) the reproduction here seems snapped up a few points: more inner detail and better imaging and nuance to the dynamic range which means you need something a few steps up from the iPod dock to get what you're paying for. With the tracks that are added -- Wood Jackson; When the Boys Come Marching Home; Baby Loves That Way; You've Got a Habit of Leaving; Safe; and Shadow Man -- make it enough volume for a second album. And they're not celeb remixes. But as good as the work is here there are no standouts that compare to the final selects comprising the original album. Nice to have, nice to hear and good to know that one of his better efforts has another incarnation. If you can spare the change, and the time.
B000Q6GUTI|3.0|\\"You don't understand how serious this is. They killed my dog.\\"    Not to mention the vastly contrived, and sometimes ridiculous, storyline that transforms Mark Wahlberg into a \\"Rambo\\" killing machine with a touch of \\"Terminator\\" to round out the bouquet.    The real star of this show is the Cheyenne Tactical M200 Intervention high caliber rifle that would make any sniper drool with envy.    Continuity and dialogue leave a lot to be desired.    But the body count is where the fun starts. Get out your pad and pencil. This one renders memories of \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" and Clint Eastwood casually eliminating those nasty Nazis.    About the dog. Very bad taste. Ruined a nice reunion type finale.
1558908374|5.0|*** This comment may contain spoilers ***    Based loosely on the writings of French animal-rights activist Jean Latrille, this movie succeeds in revealing the inhumane aspect of the puppy-farm industry, and depicts the heroic efforts of those who are honor-bound to stop it.    Brothers Jasper (Hugh Laurie) and Horace (Mark Williams) mount a daring raid of a Dalmatian breeding facility, located incongruously in a tony London neighborhood, in an attempt to rescue a group of Dalmatian puppies that are bound for market, where they'll be sold to vicious and uncaring English families. The brothers are aided by their altruistic and devoted cousin, Crue (also, obviously, a heavy-metal fan) who is played by Glen Close.    The movie follows the successful rescue attempt as the brothers lead the puppies through the wilds of Great Britain, where they find refuge at a paradisaical English estate. The film continues as a counter-raid, led by the evil agents of the puppy farm and abetted by hundreds of brainwashed animals -both wild and domesticated, is successful in recapturing the group of puppies, along with eighty-six other puppies previously rescued by the brave brothers. Crue is degraded in an inhumane manner, and the brother's vehicle is firebombed.    The film ends as the puppies are forced to fend for themselves in the wilds of the English countryside, living off the frozen remains of dead sheep and discarded fish-and-chip wrappers. Later, reverting to their wild traits, the puppies form packs in order to survive. One such pack, led by the strong, dominant male Lucky, survives on the outskirts of London by, ironically, poaching on cats and small family dogs, and soon mount an attack on the very same puppy-farm that owes to their existence, along the way dispatching brainwashed animals, corrupt bobbies, and ego-maniacal video-game designers.    Shot in cinema verite by French cinematographer Pierre Latrille (grandson of the original author) this film very aptly captures the idealistic brothers, the beauty of the English wilds, the random hubbub of big city London, and the horrors encountered by a group of animals born in the wrong place, and in the wrong time.

B000BYA4JM|4.0|Madonna may not be the best actor in Hollywood but she certainly can play a GREAT ditzy blonde.  When I was younger, this movie made me laugh, but I never payed that much attention to the story line.  Now, as an adult, I have learned to appreciate everything about this movie and it STILL makes me laugh.  One moment, in the movie, that will ALWAYS stand out in my mind, is when Madonna's character tells everyone in the hospital that Louden's last name is CLEAR.  That is great comedy!  Overall, I think this movie was underrated and the only reason why it flopped is because the majority of the populous just didn't give it a chance!  I think this movie should be seen by everyone, at least once in their lifetime!
B000E1MXSW|5.0|This magnificent film of 1957 still shines in all its luminosity after 50 years. It reminds us of the heights to which Hollywood could rise in the old studio system, which invested its resources on quality: the actors, the director, the music, the costumes, and the splendid genuine locations, from the canals and bridges of Bruges and Antwerp to the sweeping expanse of the Congo river (The scenes at the leper colony, among many others, are fascinating.). \\"The Nun's Story\\" allows us to glimpse a slice of history of the 1930s, as it unfolds on two continents. It gives us a look back into a society, both sacred and secular, that World War II was to change irrevocably.<br /><br />The superb performances of Audrey Hepburn, Peggy Ashcroft, Edith Evans, Mildred Natwick, and Peter Finch speak for themselves, and it would be superfluous of me to comment on them further.<br /><br />I merely wonder how many of the hundreds of films now churned out in Hollywood every year (the millions of dollars spent making them; their celebrity actors; their special effects) will still shine as brightly as \\"The Nun's Story\\" 50 years from now?<br /><br />Relatively few, I think!
B00004BZ0N|5.0|Some critic said that this was the album where The Clash stopped being punks and learned how to play their instruments.  Luckily for us, The Clash instantly matured as a band here to make arguably one of the greatest rock albums of all time, and maybe the greatest double album of all time.  Out of the 19 tracks here, not one is a throwaway.  The album is one of the best sequenced, most coherent albums ever made.  There is not one song on here that I skip over.  There are some that I like more than others, but there isn't one song that sucks.  Most punk bands did one of two things.  They either died/faded away, or they stopped being punks and learned how to make real music (I never liked punk, obviously).  Luckily, The Clash followed the 2nd path, and made their masterpiece.  I'll pick my favorite 10 songs here, but it isn't easy.  The title track, Spanish Bombs, The Right Profile, Clampdown, The Guns of Brixton, Wrong 'em Boyo, Death or Glory, The Card Cheat, Revolution Rock, and Train in Vain are my favorites here.  The Clash, along with The Sex Pistols who became Public Image Ltd., grew into a great band after giving up the punk thing (which really is very limiting, if you think about it).  Their follow ups, Sandinista! and Combat Rock, are very good, but this is the best of their 5 studio albums (I don't count Cut the Crap).  It's a shame they broke up (and Joe Strummer died), but we still have this great album...
B0002IQEHI|5.0|I own an early DVD release, and a more recent remastered DVD version.  This Blu-ray has noticeably better video quality.  The colors are more distinct and varied, and the resolution is slightly better.  It was worth it to me to spend the money to upgrade.     This is one of my favorite movies, and it's great to watch it in this format.
B0007LXPBI|4.0|Lindsay Lohan made her first appearance in this latest remake of the Disney classic based on the German children's book.  Two girls meet at summer camp.  Other than their styles, they look exactly the same.  When their hatred of each other forces them to be isolated together they learn the truth.  They are sisters.  Their parents split up and each took one of the twins and never mentioned the other.  Wanting to see their other parent, the girls switch places.  When the parents find out about the switch they will have to get together to make an exchange of siblings.    But there is a snag.  The father is about to get remarried.  Now everything has to be sped up if there is any hope of getting the parents back together again.  Revelations and madcap hijinks make up the rest of the film as the twins do everything in their power to stop the wedding and reunite their parents.    Much better than the Olsen Twin remake.  While much of the story is very close to the original, it has been properly updated.  The parents were a shipboard romance that failed.  Newer technology has Lohan beside herself even more than Hayley Mills was.  The rest of the cast is excellent and Quaid (the father) really shows he is a better actor than he is usually given credit for.  Even the extras are entertaining.  A fun documentary about making Lindsay twins and an extra scene involving the Queen of England.  Fun for the whole family.  Check it out.
055380457X|4.0|This book illustrates how Google has dominated the search market through brilliance, innovation and focussing on enhancing the customer experience. The story explains why Microsoft, by using its resources to suppress competition instead of providing better software, is not able to produce landmark quality products like Google, iPod and QuickBooks.  The book explores the roots of Brin and Page's entrepreneurship, and how their parents influenced their creativity.   As a business person, I found the book stimulating and inspiring. Techies will be disappointed.
0099457156|2.0|I've enjoyed a few Grisham novels but this one fell mostly flat for this reader. I guess I prefer the fast paced legal action thrillers that he is known for. It started out great with a horrific murder and dramatic small-town trial but detoured quickly into a commentary of life in Mississippi in the 70's which made it a slow page turner for me.
6305633177|5.0|This is one of my most favorite Metal Releases I own.  It's Metallica at their best featuring live footage/versions of songs from their acclaimed intitial trilogy of the true Metallica Sound (Kill Em All, Ride the Lightning and Master of Puppets).  Here, we see the true start of the Metallica Legacy prior to their rise to fame and the 360 they made in their music and style after their success with the black album.     Here, we get a gritty and raw look at the band which is both a tribute to the passing of their original bass player, Cliff Burton, Who died in the band's tragic Tour bus accident and the end of Metallica as a hungry and a very,heavy metallic band.     You'll see here film of the band in early days playing clubs and as openers for the likes of Ozzy.  You'll even get to see film of when Dave Mustaine (Megadeth) was there as Metallica's Original Guitarist.     If you want to see and hear Metallica at their very best, get this DVD!!!Next to Bing and Purge, This is the best you'll ever see Metallica to be. (Unlike the mess of the Madonna Truth or Dare Wanna-Be Film Metallica released called SOME KIND OF MONSTER, which could have easily been titled SOME KIND OF MISTAKE--The film that you could say has killed Metallica's credibility as being known as Metal Masters.)...    Thank goodness for Cliff 'Em All....

B00005JPLW|1.0|2 hours of action yarn, eye candy, scrubbed-clean CGI violence, and lacking in everything essential to good storytelling<br /><br />From a visual perspective, 300 is something of a masterpiece.  But movies aren't supposed to be visual masterpieces---they're supposed to have decent dialogue, story, and substance to back it up.  That is what separates good movies from bad ones that look good.<br /><br />I've had my months leading up to the movie and afterwards of trashing this movie for not only its blazing historical inaccuracies, but it's ridiculous treatment of basic physics and logic.  Nowhere else can you see 300 naked men bellow at two massive elephants and send them toppling off a cliff, or a single naked man kill a charging rhino with little more than a flimsy wooden spear.<br /><br />Everything in 300 save for a scene with horses was filmed in a garage or warehouse against green or bluescreen, and while it makes for some visual spectacles, it removes a certain grittiness from it that fails to capture the audience and thrust them right in the midst of the action.<br /><br />Another major failing is the Spartans themselves.  The key to any superhero comic movie (because these Spartans can't be human) is for the hero to be endearing to the audience.  The director appears to have completely fumbled this, by making the main characters incredibly arrogant, intolerant, and smug, while giving them anachronistic ideals of freedom and liberty (like a Roman Emperor preaching equality for all men) which rather than preach, they bellow at one another.<br /><br />Rarely does Leonidas say anything that isn't shrieked in the most bellicose manner possible.  His lines range in depth and complexity from \\"SPARTAAAAANS!  PUSH!\\"  \\"SPARTAAAAAANS!!  PREPARE FOR GLOOOORY!!\\"  \\"SPARTANS!!! WHAT TRADE DO WE PLY?!?!?!?!?!\\"  \\"SPARTAAAANS!  WE WILL STAND AND FIGHT!!!\\"<br /><br />By failing to endear, and arrogance, I refer to several scenes, including when Leonidas first meets Ephialtes.  In history, Ephialtes was a normal goat herder or farmer, who betrayed the Greeks by revealing to Xerxes a goat path leading around the pass out of greed.  In the movie, he's a horribly deformed monster (akin to a mix of Gollum from LOTR and Joe Merrick, the Elephant Man), with a heart of gold, seeking to prove himself in battle.  His effort to hoist a shield and thrust a spear is almost heartwarming in its attempts, yet Leonidas haughtily says that since he can't raise his shield high enough for long enough, he can't fight in a phalanx (which is particularly ironic, since the Spartans never fight in a phalanx in the entire movie save for the first battle---the director Zack Snyder even admitted doing away with the phalanx because it wasn't \\"cool enough\\" for his movie), thrusting Ephialtes into a grief-ridden rage which causes him to betray the Spartans later on.<br /><br />Leonidas also very arrogantly mocks his Phokian allies for not being born to kill like the Spartans are.<br /><br />A lot of movie cross-over appears to happen, as Ephialtes very much resembles Gollum in Lord of the Rings, so too the Persian Immortals must have been dug up in Isengard, like the Uruk-hai in LOTR---they are not human, and look very much like Orcs.  And the \\"Uber Immortal\\" as it was so brilliantly labeled, was little more than a thinner, more muscular work troll like in Return of the King.<br /><br />Whatever humanity is left in the film is squandered for the more machismo audience.  Queen Gorgo's role is little more than to look like a frumpy 50 year old housewife, muttering about some incomprehensible thing or other while another Spartan attempts to court her.  Before Leonidas leaves, he treats the audience to a sex scene so dull and lifeless that it amounts to little more than a CG dry humping with Gorgo.  The end of this subplot culminates in the Spartan who has been flirting with her getting stabbed in the public forum while gold coins fly in the air and everyone bellows \\"TRAITOR TRAITOR TRAITOR TRAITOR!!!!!\\" as he falls to the floor, dead.<br /><br />To the battle scenes: As mentioned above, Zack Snyder admitted to doing away with the phalanx because it wasn't \\"cool\\".  So rather than attempt to give the audience something new, innovative, and unbelievably bloody and violent, he gives us the same old glorified one-man-army crap we've seen in a dozen action movies.  CG or not, there's little innovation or anything to impress with the action scenes.  Many times, you're left laughing or shaking your head in disbelief as the fighters go out of their way to look \\"cool\\" rather than deadly.  One case in particular is when a Persian Immortal has a clear shot at a Spartan, and chooses rather than to stab his naked chest, to drop his weapon and DROPKICK him.  There are also instances where the chosen nudity of Spartans goes against them, as they are easily speared through the back in instances where simple body armor would help.<br /><br />At some point, you get overwhelmed with the Spartans sticking Persians with their spears like hot knives through margarine, and giant waves of bodies keeling onto a wave of Immortals, and quite literally random slow-motion sequences showing off how close a hurled axe cuts Leonidas' helmet plume, or how many rope fibers are at the end of a Persian's whip, or how many beads of sweat drip down the bronzed and chisled chest of a Spartan.  Okay, we get it!  You have a 100 million dollar budget to spend on CG and you don't know how to show it off!<br /><br />There's little else going for the movie other than nonstop and often senseless action violence which gets excessive, broken only by the lonely and useless subplot with Gorgo looking frumpy and Spartan #2 forcibly kissing her.  Even if you were to look past the unbearably significant historical inaccuracies, the gaping holes in logic (like how 300 Spartans march off to battle without any supplies, no food or water or baggage train, with nothing but their capes, shortshorts, spears, helmets, and shields, or how a wooden spear to the head of a rhino manages to kill it within seconds, or how 300 naked men, no matter how great fighters, can withstand tens of thousands of heavily armored fighting elite Orcs and Elephants and Rhinos and Humans without too much trouble until Ephialtes steps in).<br /><br />An action yarn and a visual mess of action and sunset-colored landscape, little else from dialogue and script, acting, even sound, make it distinct in any sort of way.  I doubt many people in years to come would remember this as any more than \\"That comic book movie like Sin City with Greeks\\"To the battle scenes: As mentioned above, Zack Snyder admitted to doing away with the phalanx because it wasn't \\"cool\\".

B00005JPFC|5.0|Being a rat doesn't stop young Remy (Patton Oswalt) from knowing good food when he sees it. In fact, while his family and other rats are content to gnaw at whatever they get--literally including garbage, our young protagonist seriously dreams of becoming a famous chef!<br /><br />Unbeknownst to his family, Remy had been sneaking into the kitchen of their 'house'. He was studying the French cookbooks of the departed Auguste Gusteau. Diligence pays off when Remy helps the son of the deceased follow in his fathers' footsteps.<br /><br />Remy receives the dream of being able to cook, but the road to culinary fame is not without its bumps and internal squabbling from the chef and the human beneficiary of those talents. Remembering who your friends are is very important as is not leaving them when they have helped you achieve the success you always wanted.<br /><br />Those dramatic elements made the consistency of this family film much more appetizing for an adult palette in contrast to a screenplay where all of the 'good' characters conveniently have worked out issues before we see them. I had honestly thought the idea of a film about a rat cooking food was gross upon first hearing, but this multi-layered plot humanized the main character to the point where it became a non-issue.<br /><br />The animation and graphics are okay. Early in the screenplay, I figured out that it really wasn't the reason why I and other patrons need to be watching this film. Pixar's made lots of progress, but special effects ultimately were not the focus of the production team.<br /><br />Some people are going to find this script political/preachy (and could be offended by it). The studio is trying to encourage audiences to not give up on our dreams, regardless of the size of our obstacles or even what our family initially thinks of us for pursuing it.
B000P0IW6E|2.0|I have listened to the album only once. That was enough. I have been a fan of Scorpions for many years. At 52 years old I still love my rock, and true metal. I have to agree with some of the other reviews, this album is no where near the style or sound of the Scorpions I remember of the 70s. It sounds to much like the nue-metal crap. I'll stick with Caption Beyond, Led Zepplin ect..
B00006LPES|5.0|Nobel or no, it surprised me Jelinek's novel got made into a movie.  There is of course a filmable plot to the book, but its blunt narrative is so stylized, almost childish in its urgent impetus, and hounded all throughout with a foreboding sense of reader-voyeurism, that it seemed to me totally unfilmable or at least very difficult to reproduce on film.      And then I thought - of course, Haneke.  The master of cool intellectual voyeurism, done in a visually often flat but (for the viewer) psychologically harrowing way.  Plus, Huppert, the master of sangfroid surrender.  It could not be any more perfect.  Who else but these two to translate onto film the strange, disinterested yet intense tone of the book?!  Yet, curiously, the result is surprisingly a lot less like either Jelinek or Haneke.      For one thing, I've never seen his camera as romantic as it is here.  It's almost lyric, and although unblinking in its gaze on Erika, it also clearly pities her.  It shows her depravity, but it *sees* her as ill.  I found myself wondering why Haneke did this.  He could not have failed to see the book has far less pity than a slight contempt in its clinical scrutiny.  Nor could it quite have been the usual 'movie' reason of having to make its main character sympathetic enough to stay with -- at least not for the director of movies like 'The Seventh Continent.'      These aren't complaints.  I have no complaints against this movie.  But it should be said that even if Haneke isn't interested in a transparent novel-to-film transfer, it's not as obvious in its being a 'Haneke' film (again, not a complaint).      Actually, I think the movie is all Huppert's.  She's devastating and devastated and completely searing.
0099771810|1.0|Philip Roth takes a very dull character, \\"Swede\\" Levov and spends a few hundred pages introducing him and his dull life. Something interesting happens which sends the Swede into a tailspin, to the extent that he almost shows some emotion. Roth spends the rest of the book juxtaposing the Swede's heartache with many flashbacks of his previously dull life. Waaaay too many flashbacks. Who enjoys a book like this? It's a mystery to me.
B000O178BY|4.0|I can't believe how quickly another NIN release came; Almost back-to-back to \\"With Teeth,\\" which is a great thing.  To any new-NIN-listener out there, I will say that this album feels alot like \\"With Teeth\\" in that YOU MUST listen to the entire album start to finish to get the whole picture/message/idea. It slowly sucks you into the concept; Cherry-picking out songs won't get you there. And anyone not expecting a very techno/industrial/triphop sound throughout, Tough Break. If you were expecting Linkin Park or Nickelback or Fall Out Boy, TAKE A F***ING HIKE. This is what Trent Reznor has been about since Day 1. Reznor basically gave \\"industrial rock\\" a category, and I would say it's pretty evident from \\"Year Zero.\\" It's rock, but it's soo much more.  \\"Year Zero\\" starts out with a very noisy alternative buildup through \\"Hyperpower!\\" and into \\"The Beginning of the End.\\" You receive the feeling of \\"hope-turned-into-accepted-downfall\\" by the end of \\"The Beginning of the End,\\" and the journey begins. \\"The Good Soldier\\" is probably one of the most mellow songs here, with a very cool breakdown near the end; Song feels very optimistic. Then you get hit back-to-back-to-back with songs like \\"Vessel,\\" \\"Me I'm Not,\\" \\"The Warning,\\" and \\"God Given\\" that give you a \\"we're on the highway to hell, but so be it\\" type feel. That mood slightly lightens up with \\"Capital G\\" in between, but the message stays the same.   I would say that \\"The Greater Good\\" and \\"Another Version of the Truth\\" are the climax (or anti-climax if you will) of the \\"we're doomed\\" feeling of the album, only to start turning that feeling around again with \\"Zero Sum;\\" A very beautiful song that restores the feeling of optimism, despite Reznor's lyrics: \\"Shame on us, doomed from the start..All we ever were, just zeros and ones.\\"  This album is my favorite concept from Reznor. I felt that \\"With Teeth\\" really captured the isolation of drug-abuse well. I feel that \\"Year Zero\\" captures the idea of the end of the world better. \\"God Given\\" and \\"My Violent Heart\\" were hidden gems for me. I only wish that TOOL would release albums faster like this release !
0060853980|5.0|This is one of the best books I must say I've ever read - it's funny, witty, and highly enjoyable.  The characters are well-formed and developed and the writing catches you from the very first pages.  Highly HIGHLY recommended.
B00005JPLW|5.0|I agree that the critics should just go home and stay there.  They should buy a newspaper and look in the want ads for another job.  This was a magnificient film.  Mr. Snyder did an excellent job.  I was in total awe through the entire film.  I did not find the violence that graphic or hard to take.  The carnage that took place at the time of the actual battle was much, much worse.  The battle scenes were so stylized it was like watching a ballet.  There was no more violence is this movie than in \\"Troy\\" or \\"King Arthur\\" or \\"Alexander\\".  \\"Alexander\\" was a blood bath which I never even finished.    Mr. Butler is an excellent actor and one of the few who can convey emotion through his eyes.  Ms. Headey as Queen Gorgo was a stroke of genius.    I saw this movie three times with my husband and we both enjoyed it immensely all three times.    I care not that the facts were not accurate and the film did not lead me to think of modern day problems and/or politics.  It was just a beautiful, exciting, well done film that I will enjoy on DVD for a long, long time.  It is entertainment and should be taken as such.  I leave the politics to the politicians.

0618680004|3.0|Not sure what category the book belongs in; not a philosophy nor science text; is it a theology text?  Provocative critique of whether or not a \\"supernatural\\" God exits. Not a philosophically grounded work, as author mostly debunks religion(s) usually based on most controversial practitioners who engender hypocritical responses from public. Virgin birth, resurrection and transubstantiation are at least questionnable events ~ why not explore how religions are as susceptible as any other profession for employing \\"Hollywood\\" props?
1400063515|1.0|I found the book highly polemical and the authors style annoying.  His bile seems to be primarily directed at academic economists, and secondarily at corporate risk management.  I don't think the general public is taking academic economics too seriously, and most undergrad b school majors or econ majors couldn't understand it, even if they wanted to.    Asymetrical distributions with thicker tails have been used more or less forever by statisticians and anyone seriously dealing with risk.  If everyone strictly believed in EMT, who would get involved in hedge funds or private equity?  After LTCM blew up, a vivid counter example was on Page 1 of every newspaper in the country.    As far as corporate risk management is concerned, there are a lot of black swans that are irrelevent since they wouldn't include actionable information, even if the probabilities were quantifiable.  For example, an astroid hits the earth or world war III.   We are all dead.  Even much less extreme events are essentially unmanagable at a corporate level.  The example of the casino risk managers seem like a caricature of enterprise risk management (although it may be true), but doesn't represent current best practice.   There are some real problems regarding risk management in the financial area, and although Taleb mentions them in passing, they deserve more thoughtful and lengthy treatment.  These are more in the grey swan category, and you  don't need Karl Popper to understand what's going on.  I think a grounding in the history of speculative excesses could provide some perspective on the current situation.  One timely example being financial engineeering whose main purpose is to reduce transparency -- see the WSJ on CDO's in conjunction with the Bear Sterns blip.  If Taleb would get an editor, or better yet, a ghost writer, this could have been a valuable book.
0810993139|2.0|Admittedly, I was not and am not familiar with the web comic on which this story is based, but after reading the book (which I looked forward to reading) I have to say that it was sorely mistitled.  \\"Diary of a Whiny Kid\\" would have been a more appropriate title.  Not only did this book make me so happy to have an early childhood teaching degree, it made me really question what kind of crap is being published for middle grade boys. Ditching friends for popularity, lying to parents, and generally being unpleasant is not exactly the stuff of great works for children.  And referring to everyone as \\"morons\\" wasn't overly attractive either.  Somebody should really clue someone in to the fact that whiny is not attractive, and I'd take a wimpy kid with a decent personality over this kid any day.
0525476881|5.0|In the Lindsey Lee Wells chapter--not the Katherine chapters, Colin realizes, '...like say I tell someone about my feral hog hunt. Even if it's a dumb story, telling it changes other people just the slightest little bit, just as living the story changes me....And that infinitesimal change ripples outward, from one person's story to the larger story. I will get forgotten, but the stories will ripple through the future forever....And so we all matter--maybe less than a lot, but always more than none.'    Colin, child prodigy, has just graduated from high school, unhappily beginning a new phase of his life. His heart has just been broken from unexpectedly being dumped by his nineteenth Katherine 'love-of-his-life.'  What's he to do? His mind-boggling search for a mathematical formula to predict the length of a love relationship is driving him crazy. He feels like a nobody, child prodigy flunky -- not quite genius. Besides, he's grieving for Katherine XIX to re-enter his life.  Yet, it's summer and his life-long buddy, Hassan, convinces Colin a road trip is the perfect cure for what's ailing him! Soon, on their way to NOWHERE in PARTICULAR, the boys detour off the beaten path in search of an ancient gravesite in the famous, but not-so-famous, Gunshot, Tennessee! Here is where Colin's brilliant mathematical problem solving begins to reveal great answers to living a righteous, fulfilling life and understanding love.  A real mixture of culture and a genuine bonding between the old and the young is about to occur this summer in Gunshot. John Green speaks well to the reader that time is passing and there are blessed stories to be gathered from our elders. And by the way, this ole librarian here is a former Tennessean. The story, surely, takes me back home to my hillbilly, barefoot and fancy-free days in Tennessee! A must read; you'll be laughing your way soon to a feral hog hunt with Colin and Hassan. Ya'll hang in there with the math...it'll all make sense to you as Colin figures it out!
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|In spite of the controversy, which will almost destroy any unbiased or otherwise neutral parties (or skew peoples' opinions far too much in a positive direction as a show of support for Kelly or in a negative direction as a show of derision), I personally think this is an awesome album, filled with thrashing rock numbers (Haunted), dark 80's anthems of ebtrayal that call up Pat Benatar (Judas), gorgeously blossoming ballads (the gorgeous Sober and haunting Irvine), swaggering blues cuts (like the sexy, swaying Yeah) and writhing, energetic streaks of music like One Minute or How I Feel, as well as a touch of coutnry-rock (the misty, lovely Can I Have A Kiss?).    Kelly's vocals are in top form, raw and emotional, and the lyrics are oftentimes dark, depressing, and sad, but every so often she picks the mood up a bit.

B00005JPHT|3.0|When we go to a Michael Moore film, we know we aren't going to get reasoned analysis, so there's no sense in complaining about its absence. What we get is impassioned, left-leaning advocacy on behalf of people victimized by the huge, voracious, profit-driven gaps in \\"the American system.\\" In his best films, such as \\"Bowling for Columbine\\" or \\"Fahrenheit 9/11,\\" Moore can get away with one-sided advocacy because the cold, hard, balanced facts support only his side. The first half of \\"Sicko\\" is some of the most compelling filmmaking Moore has ever done, because it details case after heartrending case of flagrant, murderous injustice committed against ordinary American citizens by the hideous bureaucracy of the American health care system. We hear of the little girl who died because Kaiser Permanente didn't authorize care at the hospital where her mother took her; of the desperately ill, disoriented people literally dumped at homeless shelters, still in their hospital gowns, because their insurance ran out; of the 9/11 rescue workers who can't get health care after sacrificing their health in the effort to save their countrymen's lives. We see former insurance company workers break down weeping because they were forced to turn down claims they knew were valid, all in the name of maximizing profits. As one of them says, \\"These people didn't fall through the cracks. They were swept toward the cracks and forced down them.\\" This is advocacy journalism at its best. Moore, unfortunately, is far less effective in the film's second half, when he extols--strictly on anecdotal evidence--the vast superiority of the British, French, Canadian and Cuban health care systems. While there's no question these systems have saved millions of people from going bankrupt over health care costs, Moore loses a lot of points by not pointing out the problems with these systems. Britain's system, for example, is a two-tiered system in which those who can afford it can go straight to Harley Street and bypass the waiting line at the National Health Service (which, despite Moore's claims otherwise, can be lethally long). And also, after pointing out that the U.S. ranks #37 in the world in health care and extolling the marvelous health care system of Cuba, he fails to note that the list he himself presents shows Cuba at #39. Moore's final stunt, taking a group of sick people first to Guantanamo, then to Havana, for health care feels cheesy and staged in the extreme. Moore has been accused in the past of taking advantage of his interview subjects, but here it's blatant; Moore is using these frightened, desperately ill people to make a Big Point Against the System. He caps the movie with an act of charity that I will not reveal, but which I think most people will agree is less an act of charity than of self-aggrandizing revenge. He'll get no points in Heaven for it, I can assure you. The insane, crippling costs of health care in this country, and the Byzantine, callous health insurance bureaucracy, are national scandals that must be reformed, and Moore brings its injustices home to us with justified outrage.

B000PFUAO6|4.0|Hate the Lyrics!!! Hate the show of Musicianship!!!  The religious and political overtones are getting to be a bit much!!!  They Ripped Off   Metalica!!!  I...I...I...Ha..Wait...Hold Up there partner.  Most bands for the most part, take parts of past and present musical and personal influences and use them to make music.  The thing with Dream Theater is that they take those influences and stretch them to limits far and beyond the boundaries most mortal people can transcend.  A little road trip.  A Dream Theater CD is like a journey.  A musical journey to test ones willingness to boldly go where no band has gone before.  It is also a trip down memory lane.  Let's face it...These guys have already shown how musically formadal they are.  It's time for them to have some fun.  Floyd, Sabbath, ELP, Rush, Zeppelin, Hendrix, Megadeath, Pantera, Mahavishnu Orchestra and yes, even Metalica.  It's all in there and more.  Is it any wonder that we compare them to so many others.  Some people want to say this band has lost it's edge.  I Say Nay!!  They just took us on a little musical road trip.  Some sites were glorious.  Some were Not so intresting.  Some were down right ugly.  I am a Fan of this band.  I love taking road trips with them.    Rock On,  Nard
B00006JSS8|5.0|You know, with Mr. Wonder we reach for superlatives and we slap them down on paper and looking back on it we realize that the meaning of our impression is deeper yet.  Listening to this retrospective of his best hits I was dazzled at how many there were, how many I remembered, how many years ago it all started and how the purity just carries on.  While there is a substantial pool of anger, resentment and rage amongst African Americans and many choose to vent their spleen in their music, Stevie Wonder chose a different path. Perhaps it is just a reflection of the love in his being, but his music always keeps pointed to a positive message, even when he is lamenting the scourge of ghetto life.      This master musician, singer, songwriter and story teller has no peer who eclipses his place.  He has given us funk so hot you just have to get up and gyrate on the floor lest you fall off your chair.  He has given us love songs so tender that dozens of other singers have sung them to great acclaim for their own careers.  It is not an exaggeration to say that with this genius, his reach has never extended beyond his abilities.  They go hand in hand, his ability to manifest his deepest creativity is unimpeded.  A person cannot be without this compilation and say that they have surrounded themselves with the best of American Afro funk, jazz and pop.  It only remains for us to wait for more music to fill up the already substantial opus that he has created.  A greater joy in music is hard to come by.  Essential.
B00005JPFE|1.0|Ever since the preview came out, I looked forward to seeing \\"Ratatouille\\" with a glowing and anticipatory glee. I even made a point of reserving a seat at the most luxurious, opulent moviehouse in Manhattan, the Ziegfeld showplace theater on 54th Street. As I walked onto the luxuriant plush red embroidered carpeting of the Ziegfeld, I was sure that I could spend the next two hours of my life in pleasant laughter, relaxation and artistic bliss.<br /><br />No such luck!<br /><br />Ratatouille turned out to be another over-the-top, soulless, conceited Hollywood animation gimmick to lure a big box office with over-the-top high-definition animated graphics, over-the-top, gratuitous action scenes (bordering on violent and scary), and lazy, contrived attempts at humor and storytelling which were nothing more than a rehash of tired old stereotypes, slapstick vaudeville routine, and use of any ethinic, social or psychobabble urban mythology which might possibly provoke an audience to force themselves to laugh.<br /><br />In fact, I can't even write a complete review of \\"Ratatouille\\" here, because I was so irritated and assaulted by this film that I felt compelled to walk out of the auditorium and leave after only thirty minutes. Not only that, but I actually felt compelled to wait in the lobby for ten minutes while the manager gave me a refund, that's how indignant, offended and violated I felt.<br /><br />Specifically: The movie's first 30 minutes featured the following irritating, offensive aspects: 1. The sound levels of the movie (not the theater, because there were quiet segments which disproved that it was the theater's sound system) were ear-splittingly, dangerously loud during many of its \\"action\\" sequences, most of which in my view would be scary, upsetting and maybe cause nightmares or upset in children. I would certainly not take my young children to see such a movie. OK, the movie is about a rat, which would be ok since he is drawn adequately cute and cuddly, but the producers felt it was also necessary to show marauding packs of thousands of filthy rats hoarding and swarming the entire screen as if they were trying to parody the rat horror flicks of the 1970's. Was it effective? Yes, it effectively made me nauseous and even disturbed, and I'm not 5, I'm 39 years old. 2., In the first 20 minutes, there are several scenes of extreme violence, all of which I thought were totally unnecessary, excessive and again, disturbing. Animated films are supposed to show *restraint* and *discretion* in the choice of their visuals and dialogue, not to immitate a Rambo action movie. Yet no such restraint and discretion was observed here, instead, the directors seemed to think they were free to shoot this movie as if it was \\"Die Hard III\\". In addition, 3., the film felt continuously as if the producers had a definite, pre-conceived \\"agenda\\"; that is, not to make a natural, free-flowing story of real characters, compelling storyline and natural comedy, music and jokes, but rather to make a movie where they had to insert an endless amount of P.C. (politically-correct) story elements and opinion-points to get across a pre-conceived \\"message\\" to the audience, checking off political points from a list as they went along. So, in the first twenty minutes, our senses are bombarded when an otherwise quiet senior citizen-retiree grandma character quietly enjoying TV suddenly gains the strength of a 20-year-old young man and literally goes \\"berserk\\" when she sees Remy and his brother rat, pulling out a 12-guage shotgun, firing about twenty-five 150-decible rounds into the walls (this is where I think my ears were damaged--in fact, my ears still hurt me now even 4 1/2 hours later), trying to blow Remy and brother to pulp, before the producers have her reach on her shelf for more buckshot to reload.<br /><br />Obviously (unless I'm just imagining things), the producers of this film (isn't Pixar and Dreamworks owned by the anti-Gun Rights zealot Steven Shpielberg?) are against people owning guns, because as they emphasize so aggressively and violently, all granmdas in farm country who own shotguns apparently always keep their guns leaning next to them on their recliners when they are watching TV, and they are all so senile and dementiated that they have pop-open umbrellas shoved into the barrels, which pop open in their face when they try to fire at any assailant; and, these otherwise placid grandmas will grab the shotgun at the drop of a hat, and proceed to shoot up their entire cottage, causing thousands of dollars of damage, on the mere sight of any rodent or any other possible threat, whether it's a stray ant, butterfly, or a scary unknown shadow. It's obvious that Steven Shpielberg and his team at Pixar have never lived with gun owners nor in farm country, otherwise they would know that gun owners in country cottages don't shoot up and destroy their homes when they find rodents, they lay traps and poison or they dispatch their cats. But then, if Pixar left out the crazed shotgun-wielding grandma scene, they wouldn't be addressing their producers' pet-peeve gun-control agenda item. (Of course, maybe Steven Shpielberg HAS lived in the country, but he probably lived on an estate with private armed security guards, which is why he doesn't understand that most of the rest of us can't afford private security and we need to own our own guns if we want self-defense.)<br /><br />Then ten minutes later in Paris, Remy spies on a typically-explosive, zealously jealous French couple, who are arguing so intensely that they point a semi-automatic pistol at each other, before quickly flinging it away and leaping into a passionate embrace. Again, according to the producers, anyone who owns a gun is a crazy, unstable basket case, and no one, especially French lovers, or those inclined to love as passionately as French lovers do, should ever be allowed to own a gun, which apparently is why France is wise and intelligent to have so much stricter gun control than we have here in the U.S., or so we're meant to believe. Thank God gun owners and people in general are almost always more responsible than how they're portrayed in this hairbrained movie and the rest of Hollywood. Now granted, the threat of gun violence has been portrayed even in classic animated movies I've loved greatly, such as \\"Pocahontas\\", but it was done subtly, and it was done in appropriate moments, and it was not over-the-top or even contrived, it was done because it was right and it made sense--here it was obviously and overtly a political or social message: gun owners are all crazy, guns should be banned for civilians, who are just too incompetent and stupid to have them, and inanimate guns are dangerous in and of themselves, blah, blah, blah. Maybe America's #1 Victim-Disarmer, Michael Bloomberg, was one of \\"Ratatouille's\\" principal investors, who knows. It certainly does display all of Bloomberg's famous manipulativeness and conniving dishonesty.<br /><br />Even in the fancy kitchen environment of Chef Gusteau's 5-Star restaurant where Remy winds up, we're made to sit through fancy, multi-trillion dollar special effects when our poor dopey rat falls into simmering stews, soapy kitchen sinks and buckets of detergent, and we can see every boring pixel of these various liquids and sauces as Remy tumbles into them and thrashes to the surface, yet nowhere is all of this fancy technical animation wizardry even the least bit pleasing or redeeming. And, the creators bungled Gusteau's character, instead of being humorous they only succeed in giving him the biggest jowls and stomach in all of France, but they forgot to make him look genuinely pleasing and enjoyable. The movie's portrayal of French people in general was merely a cross between the usual cynical, surly, nasty French grease ball-type or the pompous, self-absorbed effeminate fools which Americans are constantly urged to think all French people are by our media pundits, people like Bill O'Reilly, Sean Hannity, and similar low-lifes (all of whom themselves usually enjoy vacationing in France, which they know is one of the most beautiful and sophisticated cultures and nations in the entire world. Maybe they just don't want to let the rest of us in on their little secret, but is there really anyone anywhere, even here in Freedom Fry America, who ISN'T aware that France, with its charming, classy, educated men, knockout-gorgeous style-savvy women, classic architecture, art, exquisite geography and culture, is an utterly beautiful and heavenly place to eat, live, talk, and love??).<br /><br />The dialogue and storyline, for the first 30 minutes I was there, was more irritating, incoherent and scattered than it was illuminating or inspiring. In fact, the story played on all the usual gimmicks and cliches, with a sourpuss cynical rat father, the bright, go-for-anything younger brother character who turns out having the exact opposite of dad's personality, the Chef-deity spirit of Chef Gusteau, who the film prematurely reveals is only \\"a figment\\" of Remy's over-active culinary imagination; and of course, the hopeless underdog loser Linguini, who doubtless succeeds beyond everyone's wildest expectations at the end, right?<br /><br />How sad it all is. As I truly had been eagerly looking forward to enjoying a fine animated work of art, or at the very least a skillful and tastefully done film production. I had very high expectations for this movie, and I was grossly let down. Alas, when we crash into Reality, we realize again that it is usually not to be, not when rich investors need only pluck down a few hundred million, and their Hollywood animation houses can think up an appealing story idea (a French country rat who becomes a world-class chef--yes, that really is a GREAT idea with true potential, yet miserably wasted in this film), crank out a high-tech, easily-marketable animation extravaganza along with a slick movie trailer to pull in yearning audiences, and count on a horde of reliable industry-insider movie critics who will guarantee them a five-star, glowing review, all turned on a dime. And No, I don't care how happily or rosily this movie turned out in the end; like all Hollywood films, I'm sure everything turned our perfectly for our heroes and they all lived happily ever after, yet all that matters to me was that the first thirty minutes were TERRIBLE, therefore the movie was terrible for me, Period. A really great movie is great from start to finish, not just great for the last half or two-third's.<br /><br />When I go to animated movies, I'm prepared to suspend my disbelief and actually accept that Paris' most celebrated Chef has returned from food heaven to guide our heroes to immortality; but magic just won't be allowed, for this movie is made by the same kind of therapeutic-state businessmen as the ones who invest in a pharmaceutical industry that wants to force-feed our children Ritalin and anti-depressants; and a bad animated film like this is certainly enough to make any young child viewer eventually need to be put on a regime of Ritalin or anti-depressants--it's probably movies like this that are partly one reason so many of our kids ARE on Ritalin and Zyprexa.<br /><br />In summary, this film was so disappointing, assaultative on my senses and sensibilities, and disrespectful of my aesthetic tastes and intelligence that I was forced to quickly leave before enduring any more of it.<br /><br />I'm the kind of kid at heart who yearns for things of beauty that I can believe in and admire with all my soul. I love films like \\"Mulan\\", \\"Pocahontas\\", \\"Fantasia\\", movies of pure beauty, innocence, elegance and simplicity, and of course also Japanese anime and European comic novels where artists and writers at least treat their audiences with intellectual respect and sensitivity, if some young children happen to get a hold of those; but I don't care at all for an aggressive, loud, intellectually-lazy film like \\"Ratatouille\\" where the producers are calculatingly intent on shoving an aggressive and crude political and social agenda down my throat.<br /><br />I feel very upset having had my evening ruined going to this. How is a young child going to feel seeing Ratatouille? Either they're going to be upset by it, or they're going to be bored (hopefully) and leave, or worse, they're going to be further damaged and desensitized from another of the gratuitous, psychologically-heavy \\"entertainment\\" offerings we're constantly bombarded with in this country, films like Shrek Parts 1-100 and the rest of them, where every kids' film has to be a mind-blowing electrocution of subtle messages, hyperactive pranks, social commentary, elaborate visuals, clever entendras, nerve-shattering action scenes and cruel inside jokes. I'm sorry, but it all gives me a headache. Can't we make simple, enjoyable, warm movies anymore, movies that don't try to be too much, movies that even might have some quiet, tranquil moments??<br /><br />Yeah, Ratatouille has stunning, near-divine high definition animation. Unfortunately, it's the product of a bunch of shallow, politically-motivated Hollywood business people who don't know the first thing about what is important in High Art--and that's the kind of art I think animated movies should live up to, when they are following in the footsteps of the classic Disney-type films, and animation was first created with that aspiring ideal and commitment to pure beauty. I'll give them a hint: Any great movie starts with the writing and scripting, not with budgeting $100 billion for the f/x department. And animation art is supposed to flow and blossom naturally, not be jerked and prodded along like prisoners on the Bataan Death March.<br /><br />\\"Ratatouille\\" was a complete failure before the film even ended, when I was nowhere to be seen by the other people who had stayed to watch it. Apparently, they have far more endurance and tolerance for mediocrity than I do. Instead, I found a beautiful new art deco bar nearby where they had about a million times the sense of style, taste, beauty and restraint, just in their pinky fingers, as \\"Ratatouille's\\" producers had displayed in a mere thirty minutes of screen time and $50 million dollars of production costs. There was no loud music, no garrish visuals, no cheap jokes and no earthshaking thrillrides--finally I had regained some quiet and peace in which to attempt to decompress and calm down after this movie's body-slamming, full-frontal assault.low-lifes (all of whom themselves usually enjoy vacationing in France, which they know is one of the most beautiful and sophisticated cultures and nations in the entire world.

B00003CXRP|5.0|This Reviewer found the movie to be One of the saddest movies he has ever watched. Tom Hanks one of the greats has Done his fair share saving private ryan, forest gump,... This one Has to be his best one yet. If you are a big fan of drama,and survival movies then I highly recommend it.  If you don't want girlfriend to see you crying at the ending don't watch it.
6305075492|5.0|Dr. Caligari presents the viewer with a frightening vision of the world through the lens of German Expressionism.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this film highly enough. It's truly fascinating. And, it really (really) is an art film, since it purposefully and strikingly exhibits the new art of the German inter-war milieu. So, be prepared for an other-worldly excursion into the \\"total work of art,\\" or Gesamtkunstwerk, of this monumental and influential film.<br /><br />This film is best seen at night, alone, and with the modern soundtrack which is available on the fully restored version. If the DVD you're watching does not have (a) choice of two soundtracks (traditional music and much-scarier modern track), (b) tinted inter-titles set in a surrealistic (actually expressionistic) font, and (3) is fairly high quality, then send it back and get the restored version. The quality and completeness of silent films are a major factor in experiencing the art form as it was meant to be experienced. The modern sound track in Dr. Caligari makes the film much more accessible for modern audiences (the eerie effects in the modern track heighten the feel of the film for the modern viewer) - try both tracks, you'll see.<br /><br />It's surprising how frightening and impactful this film can be. You will have dreams about it, I promise. These between-the-wars German films are riddled with creepy foreshadowing for us in the present, who know what was about to happen in Germany.<br /><br />Anyway, I think the film is best viewed with NO NOTICE. You don't really want to know the plot (the meaning of the end of the film can be interpreted in radically different ways - keep that in mind when it happens). Only one note - artistically the German Expressionist movement is worth reading about after you see the film - you'll notice the theme of \\"death and the maiden\\" woven into this artwork. Also, this film is the direct ancestor of films like \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" and a lot more - you'll recognize the Expressionist look in many presentations in television and film.<br /><br />WARNING - I would NOT show this film to children. It's very subtly and psychologically undermining - you'll be thinking and freaking about this thing for months to come - such a thing shouldn't be experienced by children - it's an adult, art film (no, not that kind) made for adults.in many presentations in television and film.

This new offering by Donna Kato is concise, clear, beautifully researched and breathtakingly photographed.  We've waited a while for this book to appear and it has been worth the wait.  So many books on this subject offer great photography but confusing text.  This newest book offers the processes we've wanted to learn in terms that we can all manage - no matter our abilities!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Since we are rat owners, of course we were eager to see \\"Ratatouille.\\" I was charmed by the positive picture painted of rats in general by this movie and I hope as a result that people will become more tolerant of these delightful creatures.<br /><br />While rated G and made with plenty of slap-stick type humor for the kiddies, it also had plenty of more subtle undertones allowing adults to enjoy it as well.<br /><br />Remy, a young rat, lives with his mischief (the proper term for a group of rats) in the French countryside. Unlike the rest of his family, he has a very sensitive nose and discerning taste buds and enjoys the taste of fine foods. One day, when by the scent of it he discovers that some of the food his father was about to eat is poisoned, he is subsequently given the job of checking to make sure the food they are gathering is safe to eat - by sniffing each piece. He is discontent in this and seeks more - he is fascinated by humans and especially with the notion of food and cooking.<br /><br />He becomes interested in Chef Gusteau, who has a television program Remy has seen while raiding the kitchen of the house near his mischief, and whose motto is \\"Anyone can cook.\\" Unfortunately one day he overstays his welcome and the elderly lady who lives there catches him and his brother, eventually uncovering the entire mischief, forcing them to evacuate.<br /><br />Ending up in Paris, separated from his family because he went back into the house to get Chef Gusteau's cookbook, Remy stumbles upon Gusteau's restaurant. He eventually befriends an awkward young man who has just been hired on as a garbage boy. Through the sorts of coincidences only found in this sort of movie, Linguine is made a chef - with Remy pulling his strings (literally).<br /><br />Much of this movie is about with following your dreams, and becoming who you need to be, doing what you are meant to do, no matter what sorts of pressure others put on you, no matter what hardships come your way. It is about friendship and loyalty and trust. I loved it.  I think you will, too.ust. I loved it.  I think you will, too.
B000QGE766|5.0|You are missing out on TWO excellent songs if you do not purchase the European version of Era Vulgaris.  I've heard bands will do this, release hidden tracks on overseas (especially japanese) versions, to discourage bootlegging.  The songs included are \\"Running Joke\\" and, oddly enough, the title track.  The first is a slower song, most reminding me of \\"Mosquito Song\\" from Songs For The Deaf.  It's also a shorter song, at only 2:58.  The import-version's final track is \\"Era Vulgaris\\", which definitely (and obviously) sounds like it belongs on the album.  It is vaguely reminiscent of the album's opener, \\"Turnin' On The Screw\\", were it faster and lower.    If you don't own Era Vulgaris, buy this version.  If you do, it's probably more worthwhile to convince a friend to buy this instead.

B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I have no qualifications to review other than I know what I like. Probably one of the older reviewers here.  While I happened to see the last 2 shows of AI the year Kelly won, I was too busy to pay any attention at all to her career. On the car radio I tend to listen to oldies and soft pop/rock.  I'll buy CD's of artists I like and my tastes go in every direction but true country.  Recently I caught an AI year one rewind on TV and saw Kelly's versatility. I bought Breakaway and Thankful and caught up with Kelly's AI year on YouTube (never too old to learn).  My wife thinks I have a crush on Kelly.  Hmmm, certainly on her music.  But to the chase on My December.    If I'd never heard of Kelly Clarkson and someone gave me this album, I'd be blown away.  With the exceptions of Yeah and Hole (too something for me) I loved every piece of this album and I fail to see why several of these tracks can't catch on as singles. While the lyrics might be too much for younger kids,  songs like How I Feel, One Minute and Don't Waste Your Time are catchy enough (hook, schmook).  Many of the other tracks if not all should appeal to older teens up to other ages.  Chivas may be the most sly and quietly sexy song I've heard.  Moreover, just because there is a bit of a desperate theme, most novels are pretty one thematic and nobody complains. I was too busy with other things in my life to have paid much attention to Alison Morissette and Amy Lee, but so what if there is some of them in this album. Two last comments.    For those anti-American Idol snobs who hold it against Kelly Clarkson that that is how she was discovered, they should only wish that half the lousy singers who sell bad records had been weeded out by an AI process. Shame on the people in the industry who didn't see her talent before and thank the American public for recognizing her ability. So what if most of the competitors are bad. Many of them are at least okay if not pretty good. Finally as far as whether or not My December is better or worse than Break Away, it is different but not radically so. It sounds less studio and I like the more raw sound.  Kelly may be suffering the fate of people who have great talent, and that is that they start being compared to themselves, a very unfair test.  Michael Jordan looked bad when he \\"only\\" score 20 points, except that was better than 95% of the other players.  So is Kelly on a bad day, except this isn't a bad day.
B00064WSNM|5.0|Minor quibbles can be made about every record King Crimson has ever released, unsurprising as their output has been spread over 39 years and numerous lineups. However, the astonishing recordings of Trio and Fracture elevate this to the pantheon; how many bands have, or will ever have, the range and vision required to produce this music? Recommended listening for any musician who wishes to understand the possibilities of improvisation.

B000JK8OYU|4.0|If you truly like Beatles' music there's no need to buy this CD (no new music !), instead listen to the original music as it was released in the 60s on vinyl, and, later on, remastered on CD.  Use a computer to create your own mixing, and, as I did, add post-Beatles material from each of the Fab Four solo career.  Of course, the \\"Love\\" DVD Audio version offers 5.1 multi channel sound, but, believe me, the vinyl's Mono version is all I need !<br /><br />Buy this CD after you watched Cirque du Soleil's oustanding show to remind you of it.

B0009P42S2|4.0|Taken on its own, this is a dazzling film. Fans comparing various anime might find reason to cavil, but I probably like it for reasons others don't. It doesn't mix and match CGI effects or use up its bag of tricks. It's not given to constantly shifting camera angles merely because computerized cameras can do that, which still seems a novelty to live action producers. It stays largely to its color palette, the dark, forbidding tones of a Dicknesian Victorian England. By comparison I found the preview for Final Fantasy VII, which some fans probably consider state of the art, extremely boring.<br /><br />Steamboy plays like a filmed book, very deftly showing more than it tells. When there is speaking, it rarely clears things up, but merely adds more red herrings to the story. The film obviously owes a lot to Sherlock Holmes, as well as the earlier mechanical (as opposed to later electronic) ingenuity of The Wild Wild West TV show. But it draws subtly from these inspirations. Steamboy ends as it has to, in the epic fashion of Jules Verne and all Victorian and Edwardian visionary novels. One scene is also quite similar to the visually arresting opening of Chesterton's 1905 novel, The Ball and The Cross, although the story line is entirely different. I expect that except for The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, the future visions of this era are largely unexplored as film territory. The ending also suggests that a sequel, or even a series could follow. But instead it does something else: depict the \\"continuing adventure\\" in poignant scenes behind the closing credits. Choosing one of the extra features runs this imaginative portrayl without the credits.<br /><br />The main characters are all inventors, and all in the same lineage. The father and grandfather's long- winded speeches about Science are hard to take seriously, but the same optimistic view of a rosy future exists in numerous Victorian era books. The show also revolves around the London Exhibition and the famous Crystal Palace, then the showplace of British and world progress. But what else is the film? A parable? A puzzle? An exploration? Does the use of steam for military purposes echo other sorts of energy harnessed for destruction, as foreshadowed in the aeroplane sequences during the credits? Is the economic thralldom in which Britain was held in the nineteenth century meant to resonate in our own? If the denouement seems predictable and the ending somewhat forced, the issues that puzzle the characters nevertheless remain \\"live\\" questions in this visually spectacular and intriguing film.e, then the showplace of British and world progress.

B000MQ54OY|4.0|The movie was pretty good overall.  The beginning was really good and super cute.  The graphics are superb!  I really enjoyed the variety and mix of music in the movie.  Once the little penguin grew up, it seemed a little lacking.  Maybe it's voice of Elijah Woods or the rest of the storyline...I was just disappointed in the how the rest of the movie was played out.  The adventures were great, but the ending wasn't really a bang...at least it had a positive ending.  Overall, the movie is a keeper and kids will really enjoy it.
B00005JPQT|5.0|The DIE HARD franchise isn't a thinking man's dream.  It belongs to the wannabe action hero inside every red-blooded American male.  And to the women who love them.  Any misapprehension that these films are going to take themselves realistically or seriously should be checked at the door.<br /><br />LIVE FREE OR DIE HARD opened Wednesday of this week just in time for the Fourth of July celebration, and to take advantage of the extra-long weekend at the box office. It's the fourth film in the franchise about New York Police Department Detective John McClane, absolutely the toughest cop Hollywood has ever created. In my opinion. Nobody bleeds like McClane bleeds. Or limps. Or talks to himself, delivering a humorous, self-deprecating monologue on how he got into the whole mess he is in.<br /><br />There was some hesitation about whether or not Bruce Willis could pull off the franchise character again. There was no hesitation about the fact that if Bruce Willis could not play McClane, no one else could. Willis the actor and McClane the character are too tightly-knit to allow to anyone else to intrude into the franchise. Maybe other actors can play James Bond and win over a whole new audience, but I can't see that happening with this one. Not as long as Bruce Willis can still walk and talk.<br /><br />After seeing the movie, there's no doubt that Willis - and McClane -are back in a big way. For a while, Willis swore he'd never play the character again. He wanted more serious roles and a chance to stretch as an actor. He's made some good films, and some not so good films, since DIE HARD WITH A VENGEANCE with Samuel L. Jackson. And while the McClane role is somewhat limiting Willis pulls it off with zest. Maybe he was born to do other things as well, but he was definitely born to be John McClane.<br /><br />Now all the fans are going to be waiting for the next Die Hard movie, although there hasn't been any talk of such. We can only hope.<br /><br />The movie starts out with a bang, the way these things always do. A group of cyber-criminals utilize code and algorithms written by blackboard computer hackers to get into key Federal government installations, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation. They're operating under a man named Thomas Gabriel, who has used enough players in his operation that none of the computer hackers know who they are working for or what they are truly doing.<br /><br />As soon as Gabriel is certain that he's into the computer networks he wants to be into, he gives orders to start the elimination process of all the computer hackers involved. The action turns violent and bloody. Matt Farrell (played brilliantly by Justin Long) is the only one who escapes his fate, and that's only through the direct intervention of McClane.<br /><br />It's been twelve years since the last DIE HARD movie. Those twelve years are reflected in the latest release. McClane has gotten older and his life has moved on. His wife finally left him for good and he's estranged from his son and daughter. He's introduced breaking up his daughter's latest date in a fairly humorous scene.<br /><br />One of the things that was awkwardly handled in the movie was Lucy's - McClane's daughter -sudden change in feelings about her father. Viewers knew it was coming, but it came without true motivation from within. That part felt particularly scripted.<br /><br />When McClane gets the call to go pick up a known computer hacker, the tension immediately ratchets up. In a move that was also very scripted, McClane arrives at Matt's house just in time to keep him from being blown to smithereens. (And you have to wonder why the bad guys simply didn't walk into each of the hackers' houses/apartments and simply shoot them when they were done with them.  The explosions were just to give the special effects crew a warm-up for the action that was coming.)<br /><br />The cat and mouse game begins, with McClane alternately fighting to stay alive and chasing thebad guys. The action sequences are pure dynamite, fueled by adrenaline and testosterone - on part of the characters and the audience. Viewers that are totally into the McClane experience are hard pressed not to hoot and holler in support of their hero's actions and one-liners.<br /><br />Those fans understand that there are glaring plot holes and things that make no sense and in the real world things wouldn't function the way they do in the movie. For instance, the cell phone systems would go down almost immediately as emergency services took them over to use for their own operations. McClane uses a cell phone a lot in the beginning of the movie, as do the terrorists. Those would be the first things shut down. Security on major important network sites, like the eastern seaboard utility control area, would be immediately entrenched in military personnel if the United States government believed it was under attack.<br /><br />But that's beside the point. This film is about action, not about reality. Reality would be much slower paced.<br /><br />As always, McClane ends up being the guy involved in the investigation who gets all the key pieces as to what's really going on. It wouldn't be a DIE HARD movie if he didn't.<br /><br />The concept of the \\"fire sale\\" in the realms of cyber-terrorism is a real thing. There are a lot of checks and balances to keep it at bay, but it is one of the things the United States government constantly guards against. The movie sells the idea very well.<br /><br />Also, though the franchise isn't known for being cutting-edge or high-tech, there's a lot of the emerging computer technology and integrated systems that are nationwide and international in the film. Justin Long's character introduces all that technology and the concepts behind it in bite-sized chunks that the audience can keep track of in the midst of car chases, gunfights, and serious explosions.<br /><br />I found myself as enthralled by the computer attacks as I was by McClane's usual physical action and banter. There was something so inherently cool about watching the terror-geeks and Matt Ferrell at work on computer systems even though much of it was fake. The idea that it was all possible and would be done in such a way was amazing.<br /><br />But the action - that's the key to every Die Hard film. There's plenty of it in this movie. Is it over the top? No doubt about it! No one - but no one - could walk away from all the damage that McClane takes while doggedly pursuing the bad guys. I lost count of the number of bodies left behind, the number of vehicles that were destroyed in wrecks and explosions, the number of buildings that were leveled, and would have to guess that the number of bullets fired must be in the millions.<br /><br />The most over-the-top sequence in the film is the scene where McClane is driving an eighteen-wheeler through a system of elevated highways while being pursued and fired upon by a military attack jet with hover capability. There is simply no way this could ever happen, or that a truck could suffer that much damage and still keep going. Much less without the driver getting killed.<br /><br />If they do a video game on this movie as they have some of the movies in the past, you can see this sequence being part of the game. It's ludicrous.  It's impossible.  And yet, it's so McClane. And that's what puts the butts in the seats, folks.<br /><br />Maggie Q plays possibly the most lethal lady McClane has ever had the misfortune of crossing paths with. She absolutely tears him apart for a while. And that leads to possibly the second-most over-the-top sequence in the film when the action spreads the elevator shaft. Still, if anybody was gonna do it like this, it has to be rogue cop John McClane.<br /><br />Make no mistake. This film isn't for posterity. This film isn't even close to Academy Award material - except maybe for special effects.<br /><br />What this film is, and where it succeeds so admirably, is anaction film starring one of the best action heroes ever invented or portrayed, and played once more by the only actor that could do that character justice. This is superhero action without the cape and the mutant abilities. And this is a hero who's fallible yet impossible to beat.<br /><br />Treat yourself to a summer delight over the holidays. Buy a ticket. Invest heavily in a willing suspension of disbelief at the door. Find a good seat. And prepare to cheer on John McClane one more time as he goes up against impossible - and, admittedly, wildly improbable - odds.work on computer systems even though much of it was fake.

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|I'm buying the Blu ray version because it's affordable considering I have a PS3 and don't need to spend anymore for a player. Can't go wrong with that.

0471463396|4.0|What I Liked About It      * Details several valuation methods that I haven't seen in other non-academic, mainstream investing books.     * Several real-world examples to apply valuation methods     * Great treatment of brands vs. franchises    What Needed Work      * Various investor profiles unnecessarily fill the 2nd half of the book.     * Attempts at quantifying \\"franchise\\" felt a bit forced.    Greenwald's book ranks at the very top of my investing bookshelf. I read this after having read Graham, Greenblatt, Klarman, Lynch, P. Fisher, Cramer (yes, that Cramer!), Dorsey, Buffett, and Browne among others. Amazingly, this book broached a number of topics not covered by those prominent authors. As such, this book is required reading for the discerning investor.    The most important concepts this book gave me were valuation methods based on net asset value (NAV) and earnings power value (EPV). Before this, I had trouble valuing companies that didn't generate steady cash flow or have commodity assets. Now I have more angles from which to examine a prospect and find undervalued companies besides running a DCF analysis. We've heard about past opportunities where you could have bought a company like McDonalds for the price of its real estate and gotten the business for free. Greenwald shows you how to find these opportunities using his asset valuation methods. He also gives you the tools to fairly value \\"tech\\" companies (or any enterprise with heavy intangible capital). Less convincing is his discussion of earnings power value but nonetheless, it's still helpful to be able to examine a company's earnings ability.     Greenwald also spends time discussing problems with discount cash flow analysis (DCF) as well as franchises. While his thoughts on these subjects were thought-provoking, I don't completely agree with his conclusions.     On DCF, Greenwald says that trying to project future growth rates 5-10 years forward is folly and will distort your DCF analysis. Whilehe is right that future growth projections are problematic, that doesn't mean DCF isn't helpful for individual investors. Greenwald concedes that his preferred methodologies require, in some instances, in-depth knowledge of the business and industry of the company being examined. The non-professional (me!) may not have this expertise and any estimates of asset worth or capital costs would be just as faulty as analyst growth estimates. In fact, an adjusted future growth rate derived from a number of industry-knowledgeable analysts may be more generally accurate (if imprecise).    The main knock against the book is the whole second half consisting of eight investor profiles. There's nothing wrong with them per se except that they are in the book at all. If I had wanted a book on famous value investors, I would have picked up something by Kirk Kazanjian. The chapter on Warren Buffett is almost exclusively quotations taken from freely available public reports and Seth Klarman has written his own book on investing.    I've written a more-indepth review at my enlightened-american website but in summary, my advice is to soak in the 1st half of the book and skip the 2nd half entirely. Dig into an annual report instead and start applying what Greenwald's shown you.
B000S0DDG0|2.0|Despite the hype that Dreamgirls received, both critically and at the Box Office, I still believe there's something lacking here. Without a doubt, the singing is incredible, and Jennifer Hudson is truly a wonderful singer and up-and-coming actress. What was overlooked was Anika Noni Rose's amazing performance as the third Dreamette. However, the plot itself does not develop fully until very late in the movie. The first hour is almost unbearable, in my opinion, as there is little emphasis on a central occurrence, rather the director employs montages to move the movie along.     As another reviewer has noted, this movie does not hold up to Rent or Chicago. If you truly want to see it because of the movie itself, then see it. But if you're going off Hollywood's hype alone (as I did), I wouldn't recommend the movie. You really have to enjoy the original Dreamgirls Broadway concept to enjoy the movie.
B0002V7O3I|5.0|Another great older movie that is something the whole family can see! Very cute and uses the imagination!
1400063515|4.0|I'm only half way through the book, but I can pretty much guess the writing style for the second half. Taleb really knows his stuff and talks about really interesting abstract ideas. He likes to ramble a lot and takes a while just to get to the point.     Too much unnecessary narratives and storytelling. A little is good, but sometimes it's too much. Even attempts at humor are a little dry. With all unnecessary stuff cut out, I'm sure the book would be almost half as thick. Nevertheless, the overall topic of the book is educational enough for me to keep ploughing ahead. You won't find these thought-provoking ideas in any other book.

B000P0J024|5.0|There seems to be a question regarding remastering when I purchased this set. If you question upgrading your old Traveling Wilburys releases, then do not hesitate to get this set before it disappears.  Vol. 1 is an upgrade from an already great recording. But Vol. 3 is the big surprise here. I never listened to this one much because for some reason I just didn't like it that much. Upon hearing the remastered version I now think that while this one is a small notch below the first, it is so much better now that it's been remastered.  The bonus tracks are very cool too.  The DVD is that it's worth it for a behind the scene look.
B0001ZX0OW|4.0|Clint Eastwood makes boring movies. I don't know what else to say. It may just be that the cinemotography itself is dark so you fall asleep. It was a good film, with the acting saving it and though I never read the book, I heard it was like the book. Sean Penn deserved the Oscar but why this film got a Best Picture Nom. is beyond me. Eastwood is the golden child of the Academy and it is starting to get me mad
B00005JPFC|5.0|All great recipes, whether the provincial peasant dish ratatouille (a vegetable stew), or the greatest and newest dish by Charlie Trotter, draw from the ordinary. Such is the romance of eating. It is the combining of the known to create something previously unknown. Salt, tomatoes, sugar, butter are not unusual, but, in the hands of a master chef, they are ingredients for art.<br /><br />Such is the movie Ratatouille. Its history is the simple, oft-told childhood tale of the elves and the shoemaker. A shoemaker is down on his luck, with one piece of leather left, and, to his great delight, a fine pair of shoes are miraculously made with that leather when he awakes. Can he make those shoes again? Who was the mysterious maker of these fantastic shoes?<br /><br />Ratatouille takes us to a similar difficulty: Linguini, a hapless mid-20s guy who has failed at every job. At the great Gusteau's Restaurant, he becomes a garbage boy. He causes an accident with a pot of soup, and, in trying to fix the problem, makes the soup offensive to even the most plebeian of taste buds. Remy, a rat with culinary sensitivities, secretly adds the ingredients necessary to save the soup.<br /><br />Instead of being fired, Linguini is promoted to cook. Without Remy's help, he cannot cook. With Remy's help, he shows, as the late Chef Gusteau claimed, anyone can cook. Even the garbage boy.<br /><br />Remy's story, though, is the tension between his passion for cooking, and his large family. They are satisfied eating garbage, living on the run, and avoiding kitchens, as that's where the greatest dangers prevails. Reminiscent of Richard Bach's fable \\"Jonathan Livingston Seagull,\\" Remy wants more than to be what rats have always been. He wants to taste, to smell, to combine two flavors into a new ecstatic sensation. Torn between these two loves, he tries to balance their expectations with his dreams.<br /><br />As Remy's influence through Linguini in the kitchen grows, so does the renewal of Gusteau's Restaurant. It had fallen into the hands of Skinner, the ambitious and evil sous chef, when Gusteau passed away, and he was making it into a tourist locale, and branding frozen burritos with Gusteau's imprimatur. Now, Linguini as the new Gusteau, its reputation was flourishing.<br /><br />Anton Ego, a food critic who despises Gusteau's, is forced to reconsider the restaurant after he thought he had written its death knell years back. With fearful awe, his declaration to return to Gusteau's causes trembling among the cooks and staff.<br /><br />Can Ego's pretentious palate be satiated?<br /><br />Will the conflict with Linguini and Colette, his lover and cook, force bad decisions in the kitchen?<br /><br />Can a restaurant survive if people learn a rat has been running the show?<br /><br />In all, Ratatouille's a remarkable movie that relies on storytelling, not on celebrity voicings, special effects, pop-culture references or cheap humor. It tells an old story a new way, bringing a fresh flavor into a familiar meal, and is soon to be a staple in family DVD collections. See in the theater, and enjoy the magnificent animation on a large screen while you can.<br /><br />--Brockeimau's Restaurant.

B000K7VHQE|5.0|Little Miss Sunshine sounds like a cute, girly film but in fact it is an excellent film that touches so many topics. Little Olive (played by Oscar Nominee Abigail Breslin, brother of Spencer Breslin) tries out for the Little Miss Sunshine Pagent and must ride there in a car (which is like a character) with an array of interesting people. She is with her suicidal uncle, drug addicted dirty yet loving gradpa, her \\"I'm not talking till I get what I want\\" brother, her unsuccesful father who is annoying, and her loving mother who is trying her best to provide for the family. The film is fun, heartful and makes wou want more. The acting is amazing and the writing is spectacular. It deserved every Oscar it got and the Best Picture nomination. The writers masterfully switch from a depressing scene to the funniest part in the movie. AMAZING FILM
0375831002|5.0|I was given this book as a present. Although the title grabbed me, when I read the bIurb on the back I was a little disappointed with my gift. (I  thought reading about a young German girls trials and tribulations during World War Two,  would be a tad been there done that)<br />Boy, was I WRONG, with a capital W. As soon as I reluctantly started reading the first page I was captivated.<br />The Book Thief is delightfully written.<br />I breathed in each sentence, anticipating what would happen next.<br />I thought the unlikely relationships that were formed in this story heartbreaking, beautiful and yet so human. WOW.<br /><br />I love deaths attitude. His wisdom, his denial and his sense of irony.<br />This is a beautiful book. A must have. I enjoyed reading every page.<br />It's a fantastic book. I loved it.
B000PY52EU|5.0|This is one heck of a movie experience that you won't soon forget. Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci turn in amazing performaces, especially Ricci. She shows the kind of acting talent I never knew she had. Even Justin Timberlake isn't that bad here. The story is graphic and brutal at times, but it really progresses into something beautiful as it moves along. The blues music just adds to the mystique. Black Snake Moan deserved a better audience than the 11 million dollars it made in theaters. Here's to hoping Christina Ricci gets Oscar consideration.<br /><br />4.5 out of 5 stars

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Having seen all Bond movies several times and formerly thinking that Sean Connery's Bond portrayal would never be bested I now realise that I was completely wrong.

0060931736|5.0|The key events in THE PRIME OF MISS JEAN BRODIE take place in Scotland in the unsettled time between the two World Wars. In a number of ways, the title character, a school mistress in an Edinburgh girls school, is a lot like two world figures she admits to admiring: Mussolini and Hitler. While being arbitrary and authoritarian herself, she exhibits contempt for all legitimate authority. While claiming to educate her students in the true sense of the word (i.e., to draw them out), she constantly labels and confines them by her preconceptions of what she believes their destinies to be. She also manipulates their trust, inappropriately shares adult information with them, and constantly tests their loyalty. Brodie's set, as the girls are referred to by the headmistress and other \\"outsiders\\", are a privileged elite, the creme de la creme. And privilege comes with both responsibilities and risks. Spark gives a subtle reading of what it means to bask in the not-always-healthy favor of an all-too-human leader. While the novel sometimes seems to be told from the point of view of one of Brodie's students (the second half seems to belong almost entirely to Sandy, the girl with piggish eyes who becomes a nun and author of a bestselling book of psychology called \\"The Transfiguration of the Commonplace\\"), it is really told by an omniscient narrator, one capable of bridging time and making judgments no individual character with a limited perspective could ever make. It leaves the reader feeling that there just might be a power greater than the most naive victim or the most desperate, self-serving bully. This is truly a deep and disturbing book, one that should not be approached lightly or taken at face value.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|Reviewing a White Stripes album is sometimes an exercise in futility: long lauded as saviors of 21st century rock n'roll, even the occasionally experimental moves they've made (see: \\"Get Behind Me Satan\\") are overwhelmingly met with hipster back-slapping approval.  So in fairness, let's forget for a minute that \\"Icky Thump\\", the band's latest offering, is in fact a White Stripes concoction.  Imagine, if you will, that this disc, shrink wrapped in all of its red, white, and black color themed glory, was just a release by a band whose lead singer did not carry all the accolades that Jack White can boast.  What might the response to such an album be?  To invoke Tenacious D: it rocks my socks off.<br /><br />\\"Icky Thump\\" is blues tinged garage rock at its most primal, and if you really want to give in to your instincts and love this disc for what it is (the most satisfying musical experience you're likely to know thus far this calendar year), please drop your indie pretentiousness at the door.<br /><br />Yes, it's obvious....the two people who make up 99% of this recording are clearly at a level of chemistry that few of us can comprehend.  Whatever might be lacking in technical prowess or polished performance is made up for with an emotional intensity that begs to be listened to multiple times.  Listen to the cover of Patti Page's \\"Conquest\\" or the narrative \\"Rag & Bone\\" for definitive evidence.  Do you just want infectious pop hooks?  Try out \\"You Don't Know What Love Is\\".  Need some guitar heroics a la Led Zeppelin?  Listen repeatedly to \\"Little Cream Soda\\".  Craving textures that sound like Steve Albini met John Bonham in the afterlife?  Give \\"I'm Slowly Turning Into You\\" a spin.<br /><br />Say all you want about Jack's progress as a guitarist and vocalist, or about Meg's ability to furiously bludgeon her drum kit like tomorrow may never come.  The bottom line is that \\"Icky Thump\\" is a fantastic album, regardless of your thoughts on \\"De Stijl\\".  Go buy it, and believe again in the redemptive power of rock and roll.tive power of rock and roll.
B0000E5NPZ|4.0|BONJOUR TRISTESSE (1958), based on the infamous bestseller by teenager Francoise Sagan, captures the early trends of French new-wave cinema.  Even today, this film still holds up beautifully thanks to it's progressive themes and top-flight performances.<br /><br />The story is told in flashback.  Cecile (Jean Seberg) and her widower father Raymond (David Niven) spend their summers in idyllic bliss on the sun-soaked French Riviera.  Their relationship is open; Cecile can trust her father to allow her all the freedom she wishes to enjoy the opposite sex, and vice-versa.  All that changes when Cecile's stern godmother Anne (Deborah Kerr) arrives to spend the holidays.  Anne wants Cecile to start seriously preparing for her future, Cecile would rather run wild with her latest boyfriend Philippe (Geoffrey Horne).  When Raymond announces his plans to marry Anne, Cecile sets into motion a plan that will trigger untold tragedy for them all...<br /><br />Francoise Sagan's semi-autobiographical book was always going to be an ideal film, and producer/director Otto Preminger's 1958 movie still hits the right mark.  The lives of the moneyed (and mindless) on the Riviera coast, their nasty manipulations, and what happens when a woman tries to change the destructive relationship between a father and daughter, is truly fascinating.<br /><br />The cast is sensational.  Jean Seberg, with her unique combination of willowy European grace and all-American charm, is the ideal choice for Cecile.  Deborah Kerr's performance as Anne walks the fine line between comedy and drama; and David Niven's performance as Raymond is equally fine (Kerr and Niven had co-starred in \\"Separate Tables\\" the same year).<br /><br />The supporting cast is very strong too.  Mylene Demongeot steals many a scene as the feather-brained Elsa, Martita Hunt has an all-too-brief bit as Philippe's mother; the cast also features Walter Chiari, Juliette Greco (as the nightclub singer who performs the Title Song), and Roland Culver.<br /><br />BONJOUR TRISTESSE is a fabulous film, from it's moody B&W sections to it's sombre ending.

B000Q6GX5Y|1.0|What is going on with Blu ray...HD DVD has so many more cool features than the Blu Ray version...I own a PS3 and can't get these features because of Blu Ray. The same thing happen with Blood Diamond...HD DVD blows away the Blu Ray Disc with extra features...I am sick and tired with Blu Ray not being up to par with HD DVD...so I have decided I won't wait for Blu Ray titles anymore I will buy them on HD DVD...therefore I will be purchasing a HD DVD player this week. Plus I can get a HD DVD player for around $250...very disappointed in Blu Ray.
B000AOEMXM|4.0|Caveat emptor / buyer beware!<br /><br />This is just a note to people considering buying \\"Star Trek: Enterprise The Complete Seasons 1-4\\" on DVD from certain Amazon sellers.<br /><br />If you see the Star Trek: Enterprise DVD collection in a single box rather than in four separate boxes (one box per season), it's likely an Asian import edition rather than from the studio.<br /><br />Especially beware the appellation \\"the Chosen Collection\\" which was copied from the complete collector's edition of Joss Whedon's TV series Buffy the Vampire Slayer.  The Buffy \\"Chosen Collection\\" is official while the Star Trek: Enterprise \\"Chosen Collection\\" is not.<br /><br />Furthermore, if the DVD set mentions it's region free, then it almost certainly is an Asian import, because the studio does not have a region free version of Star Trek: Enterprise on DVD (at the time of this review).<br /><br />It's true the Asian import edition will be considerably cheaper, and as I mentioned region free, but there are drawbacks as well.  For example, the audio and video quality suffers relative to the regular edition.  Also, if there's a scratch or other slight defect on one of the DVDs, most of the sellers won't refund the buyer's money or replace the DVD(s).  Some might, but it could be tricky (and perhaps despite their claims to the contrary).  Not to mention that purchasing an Asian import means the money goes to the Asian distributor and its affiliates rather than to, say, the cast or crew or anyone else on the actual production team -- which in turn could presumably be funneled into bringing back Star Trek (although it's debatable).<br /><br />And please make sure to read Oren D. Applequist's helpful comment below regarding World Express Mail Service (EMS).<br /><br />Anyway, obviously people are free to do what they like, but I'm mentioning all this so buyers can at least be aware of the risks.
B000QFAJ7S|1.0|This is by no means a review to bash Kelly Clarkson. I enjoy her music and I even have some of it on my MP3 for running but this CD has only one hit NEVER AGAIN on it, which has already ran it course peaking at number 8 on billboard. The CD is a lot of rock and roll and the ballads are extremely weak. I will say it will enter the TOP 10 in Billboard but not number 1. I also think it will drop very quickly. The cover does not match what is inside. The cover would be more appropriate for her first CD Thankful. The songs inside have a more harder, aggressive sound and the cover should of reflected that. Hopefully after this CD is forgotten she will come back with a much better and powerful CD. This is not it.
B000OYC3J8|4.0|Okay, this album is worth the buy- lets get that one right out of the way. It rocks, it grooves, it screeches. If you like the stripes, classic rock, or Lomax-era blues in general, you have a new album to buy.    The White Stripes have always been fans of 'borrowing' sounds from other artists, but this one takes that to a new level. You are going to hear a lot of Zeppelin in this. \\"Catch Hell Blues\\" sounds like Page himself (although one can't help but wonder what John Paul Jones would sound like thrown in the mix.) Then you have songs like \\"Bone Broke,\\" which sounds like an ACDC throwback, \\"300 M.P.H. Outpour Blues,\\" which is clearly an Animals homage, and the like. \\"I'm slowly turning into you\\" and \\"A Martyr for my love for you\\" sound more like Jack's side project, The Raconteurs. I can't complain.      My only complaint is that Jack is trying to ditch the stripped-down image without moving up to a bigger band. \\"Conquest\\" has enough instruments going on that it sounds like cheating to be coming out of two people. \\"St. Andrew\\" is one of those recording studio groaners up there with mid-album phone calls and \\"Little Room.\\" Some of those lost points are made up for the technical skill found in the title track, which has Jack jumping instrument to instrument and octave to octave like a madman.     Right now, this is 2007's best album right behind Modest Mouse's latest effort.    Oh, and \\"Rag and Bone\\" rocks.
055358894X|2.0|I'm completely baffled by the large number of glowing reviews here. It seems to me that a great number of readers are looking for a very light and amusing style of fantasy. Perhaps this book has broad appeal for the same reason that movies like Ocean's 11 have broad appeal. Any tale of a gang of hipsters acting cool and pulling the wool over the eyes of the rich seems enough to satisfy many people.<br /><br />Personally I tire of the thieving anti-hero who spouts endless one-liners. Unless there is some real substance beneath the hip banter it just starts to seam silly. But I read the first hundred pages or so of this book and I could not find a hint of substance.<br /><br />We first encounter our anti-hero as a very young boy, orphaned, living on the streets but possessing great thieving skills. He is apparently completely uneducated and spends his days engaging in petty theft. Suddenly we skip ahead a decade or more and our anti-hero is now plotting elaborate cons. He speaks many languages. He can pass himself off as a rich merchant and converse knowingly with nobles.<br /><br />This is where the book totally lost me. If you want me to believe that a grubby little guttersnipe grew up to be a master con man you really have to show me how this happened? But is this book it seems we are just supposed to accept it.<br /><br />I think I would have loved this book when I was sixteen. But these days I prefer a little more depth, believability and continuity in my fantasy.
B000Q6GUT8|1.0|This was the single worst adaptation of a good action novel into an incomprehensible film I've ever seen!  Ghastly in every way, the producers and director chose to ignore the book's excellent plot, change the venues and the characters, mess up the action scenes and obfuscate the story line.  The casting was terrible with Glover as the Colonel, a young chick as the love interest, and a Hispanic as the FBI agent.  Most of the dialog was impossible to follow and the whole script failed.  Wahlberg was especially bad as the hero and the film was filled with mistakes and hardly rates a single star.  Avoid it unless you want to watch total confusion and the destruction of the story line in a good book.

0752852612|5.0|Some novelists are great in their genre. Some novelists create a genre. In many respects, this book exemplifies the birth of the genre referred to as the American crime novel - one which Raymond Chandler said \\". . . took murder out of the Venetian vase and dropped it into the alley. . . .\\" And, oh how from-the-street this novel is.<br /><br />This novel started a critically acclaimed  writing streak for Hammet - 1929 (\\"Red Harvest\\"and \\"The Dain Curse\\"), 1930 (\\"The Maltese Falcon\\"), and 1931 (\\"The Glass Key\\").  Hollywood was right behind the publishers as they produced his books to film almost as soon as the print dried on the second printing: 1930 (\\"Roadhouse Nights\\" based on \\"Red Harvest),  1931 (\\"Maltese Falcon\\" ) and 1935 (\\"Thin Man\\" and 5 other movies to follow with the Thin Man theme.)<br /><br />Hammett was hot. Maybe the hottest commodity in print and screen the first five years of the 1930's.  Then in 1936 he secretly joins the Communist Party and you can guess the rest.<br /><br />This book reviews many of his personal experiences. At 31, he became a private detective (Pinkerton Agency) and the major character of this book is a 190-pound 5'6\\" solidly built unnamed character who works for a similar agency. He is called an Op. And, his \\"Old Man\\" sends him to Personville which is affectionately referred to as Poisonvile - dank and mysterious, it lost its innocence when old man Willsson hired Italian goons as union busters to preserve his bottom line for his many capitalistic ventures.  After they did their dirty business, they stayed and the old man could not live as he had before - in total control of the city.<br /><br />When the Op is shot at by goons and cops, he decides that even though his business is over, he will stay and earn $10,000 while making himself a Poisonville regular.  Thereafter, 24 bad people are murdered - cleaning the streets of the bad blood - and the worst injury suffered by the Op is a burn.  Good conquers all, or mostly all. The Op meant what he said, and said what he meant, he hated the town 100%.<br /><br />Hammett, probably from having to gumshoe streets following leads for the Pinkerton Agency, understood American vernacular.  Implementing the same created his \\"style\\" which probably was not consciously done. But, it was artistic. And, this artistry is purely Americana.  American vernacular was new in literature - something which was also brought to readers by another hot commodity of the 1930's - Ernest  Hemingway.<br /><br />His curt and precise statements, dialogue, and great descriptions of the physical appearances of characters are Hammett's best weapons. And, this is one of his best books - probably only exceeded by \\"Maltese Falcon.\\"  It seems only a shame that he could not produce more of these novelst he meant, he hated the town 100%.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|My December is by far KC's best CD.   It has no fluff and filler - the stuff Clive Davis places in between the 1 or 2 good songs on each of the CDs he controls.   Kelly's truly amazing talent shows through on this CD and it's wonderful that she refused to follow the people who only care about mass producing crappy records that kids buy for one good song -- so the execs can make as much $$$ as possible.   Each song on this CD is different and good if not GREAT.   Never Again is the breakout hit so far, but Sober is great and Irvine and Chivas (the hidden song at the end) are true MASTERPIECES!   They are sung in a much different style and KC masters the art beautifully.   I'm impressed by her songwriting abilities too -- at least she is writing her own material instead of waiting for a good song to come along.  She has a wide range of style and this CD shows it full on.   If you are looking for more \\"A Moment Like This\\" Americal Idol anthems - you won't find those here.  - This is gutsy, real and truly soulful  -- sung by one of the best voices recording today.  It should win Best record of the year, and several songs could be best song for the Grammies.  But the Clive Davis employed voters/powerhouse might interfere with that.   We'll see!

A must have.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I am a big fan of Linkin Park's debut first 2 CDs, but even though this album is much tamer in comparison, it still sounds awesome & it still has the Linkin Park feel to it. Simply put, the band is trying to expand & test their musical abilities without making the same album over & over again. I think if you are an open minded rock music fan this album should satisfy you on many levels.
034544678X|3.0|This is a good book for all dog lovers, but too wordy sometimes and with too much information about chimpazee, bonobos and gorillas that makes you think you are not reading a book about dogs.

Not a waist of money but after reading such wonderful comments about it I am a little dissapointed.

B00065MDSQ|4.0|King Crimson's IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING (1969) and RED (1974) share some similarities. Both contain only five tracks. Both kick off with a furious aural assault (\\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\" and \\"Red\\", respectively). Both end with an extended, dramatic epic (\\"In the Court of the Crimson King\\", \\"Starless\\"). Both contain an interesting but ultimately rather pointless jam (most of \\"Moonchild\\", \\"Providence\\"). And both mark pivotal moments in the band's history. For while IN THE COURT OF THE CRIMSON KING was the group's debut and kick-started the progressive rock movement, RED was their final album before guitarist and bandleader Robert Fripp suspended King Crimson indefinitely (or until 1981 anyway).    But for what similarities there are between the two albums, the King Crimson of RED is very different from the King Crimson that had debuted only five years earlier. Only Fripp remained from the original lineup, joined by bassist/vocalist John Wetton (later of Asia) and drummer extraordinaire Bill Bruford (formerly of Yes) and augmented by familiar players Ian McDonald (sax), David Cross (violin), and Mel Collins (sax). Where that earlier band reveled in lush, melancholic Mellotron soundscapes, this incarnation was leaner, meaner, pounding out angular, metallic riffs and attacking their material with the ferocity of a much less \\"sophisticated\\" outfit. The first vinyl side (\\"Red\\", \\"Fallen Angel\\", \\"One More Red Nightmare\\") is irreproachable, and the aforementioned \\"Starless\\" is amazing, magnificently building tension from a moody COURT-like beginning through a Spartan, jagged middle into a positively vicious climax that renews the opening theme with symphonic accuity. Only the overlong improvisation \\"Providence\\" - and the band's complete lack of a sense of humour, which can be very important when it comes to self-conscious, overblown prog rock - holds RED back from true greatness. But even in imperfect form, there's much to enjoy from King Crimson's last hurrah before a seven-year hiatus that would result in a fundamental change in the band's sound and direction.
B000MXPE74|5.0|Fun!  Fun!  Fun!  Three guys with guitars!  Say what you will otherwise about this CD, but when it comes down to it, this thing is 100% pure unadulterated fun.  I heard one song on the radio (#4, Chelsea Dagger) and had it stuck in my noggin after that- it was very annoying!  The next day, on a hard-fought whim I finally bought the album at Best Buy.  I have never regretted this!  Really it was out of desperation, since all the music out \\"all sounds the same nowadays\\".  Come on... you've said it too.  It's not just that you're old- 99% of what's out there right now sucks a$$.    That's certainly not the case here.  This is the very, very rare album that's actually worth buying.  There's not a bad track on here.  When's the last time you said that about a CD?  Buy it... you will not be sorry!
1590171993|5.0|On the first page of this fine novel the author tells us that the protagonist is a man of no particular esteem, a university professor who, after 38 years of teaching at the University of Missouri rose no higher than the lowly rank of Assistant Professor.<br /><br />William Stoner came to the University of Missouri from a poor farm, became entranced by medieval and renaissance English literature and went on to get a PhD in that field. He was a shy man, and throughout his life had but two real friends. His wife was not one of those two. Within a couple of months of marriage Stoner realized his marriage was doomed to failure. Early on, a situation arose at the university in which Stoner, adhering to principle, earned the lifelong enmity of his department head. Another situation arose that offered Stoner a chance at happiness, and that failed.<br /><br />One reviewer of this book wrote that he didn't see why anyone would want to read this book about a loser. But was he a loser? In an interview the author, John Williams, stated that he felt that Professor Stoner was a \\"hero.\\"  Surely this is a story of a man who really never got anywhere in life, his marriage was a failure, his parenting poor, and he never was really a vibrant member of the university faculty. Yet in some ways Stoner never gave up. Lacking innate teaching skills he worked hard at it, and became a popular teacher. He was never bitter, and, though struggling as a parent and father, he held on.<br /><br />So there are two ways of looking at our \\"hero\\" or \\"loser.\\" I found the book to be a wonderfully different view of a man's life. Certainly we can identify with him in some of our own failures, with our own wishes that maybe somethings in our lives might have been different.  Then again, I don't read a book necessarily to find someone that I can identify with. I am intrigued by interesting lives that may be totally different from my life, or my fantasy life.<br /><br />One final comment. I found the last 20 pages of this book to be heartbreaking. Being an older person myself, I am especially touched by the difficulties that age brings on. This is an excellent literary novel abounding with elegant writing. For me it was one of those books that I thought about for days after I finished it.be heartbreaking. Being an older person myself, I am especially touched by the difficulties that age brings on.

Michael Pollan offers no easy answers but encourages readers to do a lot of self-examination to determine what choices they should make in feeding themselves and their families.

0316067598|3.0|The parts where he described his team's gallant conduct were outstanding.  The parts where he tried to blame everything on \\"liberals\\" were dissappointing.  You don't have to be a liberal (or a Christian) to believe that innocent human lives have the same value, whether they are American or Afghan.  Being in the teams is an incredibly hard job.  Maybe you have to be a bit brainwashed to do it?  Regardless, I think Marcus should be proud of his team's actions.  They did the right thing.  But the author's frequently-expressed political misperceptions spoil the book.  I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone but the most avid student of special operations.  Just too much fluff.  If you've read Dick Couch's books and/or know someone in the teams, skip to about page 160 and take it from there.

0596527055|5.0|Scott Berkun has written a great book on innovation that is different from most of the usual fluff on the topic.  Each chapter of the book is devoted to a myth related to innovation, (hence the title) and the author goes on to discuss why the myth has propagated as truth and why it is wrong.    In my opinion, the great thing about this book is the examples. The author has picked great anecdotes from the past and dissects them to prove his point.    One of the best chapters is the Myth of Epiphany, where he goes through Isaac Newton and gravity.    This book is a must-buy because of the many insights and reminders that you will get. It is also very well-written and absorbing; I missed my stop on my commute to work because I was too engrossed reading it!
0385522401|3.0|This was a very drawn out short story masquerading as a novel. I was not captivated by the two main characters or all the extraneous back-story. It did not feel as if this is taking place in the early 1960's because the author failed to bring me there. I had to keep reminding myself it was not the 1800's. The chapter in the honeymoon suite and the final section 5 would have made a very good short story.

B000E97Y6K|5.0|I grew up loving the early ape films King Kong (1933) and Mighty Joe Young (1949). King Kong is a classic retelling of the Beauty and the Beast story and the original was groundbreaking in its use of special effects. Remaking a classic will always attract harsh critics.<br /><br />For me, a lover both of classic films and of modern science fiction, I place King Kong (2005) among the best films I have seen in years. In the cinema, this was a true spectacle to behold. The action and CGI special effects were astounding. Peter Jackson took a fairly sparse story and fleshed it out. I appreciated the longer back-story to the characters in New York prior to the sea voyage to Skull Island.<br /><br />The exposure of themes relating to racism, animal and ecological abuse, and treatment of women was obvious, but not preachy. Despite this being an action film, these themes seemed to me as large as Kong was himself.<br /><br />Jackson tweaked the storyline a bit and improved on the original. The introduction of the writer (Brody) as love interest instead of the ship captain made more sense and was simply a better story. With the original film, I was quite moved as a kid when Kong died. With this version, I was at least as moved or more as an adult. The relationship with Kong and Ann was portrayed better. I believed that they had made a bond with each other. The moment of Kong's demise is one of the most touching moments I have seen in a film in years.<br /><br />Finally, James Newton Howard's soundtrack is quite moving, with beautiful, stirring melodies befitting this grand film. Worth listening to in its own right. I would have liked to watch the film with an isolated music score. Unfortunately, this was not included as an option on any edition so far.<br /><br />Editions:<br />Two-Disc Special Edition (2006)<br />For the collector, this included the Production Diaries and several bonus features.

B00007J4SI|5.0|The wide divergence of review comments about this CD set reflects the difference of opinion and preference for how Scriabin's music should be played. As a member of the Scriabin Society of America, I've personally seen and heard many different interpretations of many of the etudes, preludes and other pieces in this large set ... I've also heard many strong opinions voiced both pro and con these various performances.  In the end, it all comes down to whether you like your Scriabin lean and taut, or prefer him broad and expansive. I come down on the &#34;lean&#34; side, which is why I enjoy these performances. Michael Ponti misses some notes here and there, but when your Scriabin is almost going off the edge, that's what happens. Scriabin should never sound &#34;pretty&#34; in the manner of Chopin, which is where so many pianists get it wrong. Yes, he owed much to Chopin, Balakirev and other pianist-composers, but that was merely the jumping off place for Scriabin as he plunged headlong into the 20th Century.  Yes, there are moments of sheer exquisiteness to savor, but ultimately Scriabin's is music that stretches the bounds of tonality and rattles the structural cage, trying to break free.  When you listen to this set, you'll discover that not all of Scriabin's compositions are top-drawer (no big surprise when you consider the massive number of works he composed over many years).  And it's also true that when one single pianist is tackling it all, not every interpretation is going to be equally inspired.  But once you've heard Ponti's special way with these pieces -- bright piano and all -- you'll never again be satisfied with a merely &#34;correct&#34; or &#34;poised&#34; reading. That's selling Scriabin WAY too short ... but it's what 80% of the other pianists do. (Oh yeah, but they might get all the notes correct.)  Be sure to purchase this set along with the companion 2-CD set of the complete sonatas that also includes a few late, late works.  Ponti's performances of the sonatas are even more effective, IMHO.
B000059T00|5.0|As the author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\" I am often asked to write or talk about various 60's and 70's rock and roll recordings.<br /><br />Although it was devastating that Cream had broken up, Two-thirds of the band Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker surfaced along with Steve Winwood and Ric Grech in Blind Faith. Although there would only be one album it has left its mark as a must own for any fan of blues-rock and Clapton or Winwood.<br /><br />Please make sure you are viewing the 2CD version with the original LP and the nine bonus tracks (Including 1 CD of all Jams).<br /><br />The deluxe issue has such intense bonus material that it had to be extended to a two CD set. \\"Can't Find My Way Back Home\\" and \\"Presence Of The Lord\\" have so much soul and emotion it could give a heart to the Tin Man.<br /><br />There isn't a bad moment from the opening note to the final bonus track. Although you'll feel like a kid in a candy store and want to experience a bit of this and that, listen to the first six tracks on CD 1 straight through. This will enable you to experience the music the way it was in 1969 and in the best quality. After you are able to digest the brilliance of the album if you have any energy left go for the bonus tracks. Some may have had the pleasure of hearing \\"Sleeping In The Ground\\" previously. When you get to the Jams it will reaffirm why Clapton's output from the Yardbirds through Derek & The Dominos was nothing short of Herculean.<br /><br />Be well always,<br />Craig Fenton<br />Author of the Jefferson Airplane book \\"Take Me To A Circus Tent\\"
B000059MEK|5.0|I don't listen to much electronica/dance/house/techno/whatever you want to call it, so it takes quite a bit to make me actually pay for an album of it. But Daft Punk is too good at not just cool computery noises, but also just making music, that it's hard not to like. Unlike some artists whose work consists of the same basic riff or melody over and over again for an insane amount of time, Daft Punk makes actual songs with structure and points, and their instrumentals are a lot of fun without being too long. They do a fair amount of sampling of music from some older songs, some credited and some not. But they're not lazy with the samples, they usually work them around and integrate them into a song, making it their own.    The album starts with \\"One More Time\\", and it's a perfect opening, throwing you into exactly what the band is and making you feel really good. \\"Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger\\" is maybe the most recognizable song on the record, and for good reason I guess. It's really catchy and sticks in your brain, although I've heard it a lot before and I'm not sure how well it fits with the rest of the tracks. The album has a good variety and vocal and instrumental songs. The vocal ones are more instantly memorable but there's some good stuff in the other tracks. I really like \\"Superheroes\\", which samples \\"Who's Been Sleeping In My Bed\\" by Barry Manilow but changes it to make it sound completely different. \\"Aerodynamic\\" has a really cool guitar solo part that maybe gets repetitive but it's just a fun song to listen to. That describes pretty much the whole thing, on which every song, excepting one filler track, is unique and enjoyable. If you can get into something different at all, it's worth it.
B000IOEQ1M|2.0|What destroyed America's newest aircraft carrier, a Nimitz-class ship bristling with high-tech and weapons?  When one of the USN's flagships disappears in a nuclear explosion, the official explanation points to a catastrophic nuclear accident.  Higher-placed Naval officials nurse a more sinister explanation - nuclear terrorism masterminded by an ace submariner using a rogue crew.  USN Commander Bill Baldridge pieces together clues that reveal the mastermind's complex identity, and may lead to his apprehension.    Cool, huh?  This was Pat Robinson's first novel, so it has the benefit of not having the example of his prior books, and their myriad realism flaws, technical faults, logic gaps, almost insultingly bad dialog, compulsive use of irrelevant (and often incorrect) technical data and overall right-wing bombast.  That said, NC wastes little time establishing these very serious errors on its own merits.  Robinson goes through the motions creating as realistic a depiction of carrier aviation as you could expect from some low-grade flight sim (accept that such sims don't typically come with African-American characters who speak as if they walked off some 1930's movie) before the carrier gets turned into radioactive dust on the sea.  Robinson then proposes his rogue-submarine idea, but never explains how such a sub managed to elude detection designed to screen such targets.  Real carriers come with ASW aircraft, sensors and weapons, but in Robinson' story, there is no task which cannot be placed on the back of a sub.  Robinson comes up with some nifty plot ideas to identify just who the villain is - unfortunately he comes up with several such ideas, none becoming interesting or plausible before the gears are shifted and a new direction is taken.  Finally, NC sets the pattern for other Robinson thrillers in that it has real ending - it's like PR got tired of his own story.
B000P0IW6E|5.0|This is simply the best CD I have listened to this year.  Granted, I am a product of the '80's and I have a soft spot for the bands of my youth.  However, I have been disapointed with recent releases by the hair bands of my youth as they try to return to glory.  The \\"covers\\" movement (i.e. \\"Poison'd!,\\" Def Leppard's abysmal \\"Yeah,\\" and Tesla's rip off \\"Real to Reel\\") by these bands has left me depressed.  I ordered the new Scorpions' CD from Amazon and with apprehension but in my car's CD player.  I was simply blown away.  This is the best Scorpions album in years-\\"Crazy World\\" way back in 1991 was the last album of theirs that I could listen to.  The songs are simply great and the band plays fantastic!  The CD sounds to me like a mix of classic Scorps and more modern bands like Marilyn Manson (The CD actually reminds me of Alice Cooper's \\"Brutal Planet\\" and \\"Dragontown,\\" both of which I actually DIDN'T like!).  The only disapointment I had was that there were no lyric sheets included.  Normally, I don't really mind, but sometimes Klaus Meine is a little difficult to understand and, according to the liner notes, this is a concept album about a war between man and machine (How original!), but I couldn't really follow the plot.  Anyway, unfortunately this CD is not being released in the US, but do yourself a favor and order it now!!
B00003CWOL|5.0|I love thought provoking comedies. You certainly do not have to be Catholic (in any form..lapsed, practicing, whatever) to get the most out of this movie but it does help. The film abounds with intelligent, provocative dialogue spoken by excellent actors. And it's hysterical!<br />It takes a skilled director/writer to construct a movie that can make you laugh AND think.<br />A previous reviewer suggested that the characters are all annoying. I have to disagree. The characters are well rounded. They are all fleshed out by tremendous actors. The performances are believable.<br />It has also been suggested that this film is irreverent. Well, possibly, but a little irreverence is what makes most smart comedies fly.<br />Have fun with this movie. Watch and listen to it's keen perception of religion and faith. But most of all enjoy the brilliant comedy, first class performances and captivating plot.
074325144X|5.0|Training for the Salt Lake City 2007 (my first) marathon, i got injured and doubted whether I would be able to do it at all. After reading this and applying it's techniques, i found that my technique was all wrong (or non-existent). Determination and commitment were not enough for an endurance race! I thought running was something you 'just did'. Wrong.    Not only did I finish under 4 hours, but i had an injury-free race and even felt fine afterwards.     That was all due to the book - I can't praise it enough. I also bought the video too. It was the best money I spent on running gear - after my shoes!
0805066691|5.0|Bury my heart at wounded knee is a oustanding account of native american history. Very informative and captivating, piquing my interest in native american's. The words tell of a people heroic,caring,hospitable, and understanding almost pushed to the point of annihilation at the hands of conquistadors,whites and others. Sadness,anger,hate, and sympathy are just some of the feelings brought out by reading this book. If you want an unflinching account of native american history this a great place to start.
0375759174|4.0|I do not like the title since only part of the story takes place in the Northanger Abbey. The novel has some fame as a parody of Gothic novels, but that is not the primary focus of the novel. This is a novel written by Jane Austen at least a decade before her famous novels. It is similar to the later novels but it is less sophisticated, shorter, and it seems fragmented - as I discuss below. It was sold for publication in 1803. It is her earliest work but it was not a success. She bought back the rights and it was published after her death in 1818.<br /><br />As background information, I have read all of Austen's novels, and I have read various analyses of Austen's work. Jane Austen's formula for success was to write a novel about of a financially disadvantaged young woman who meets and marries a wealthier man. The exception is her novel \\"Emma\\" where the protagonist has her own means. There are no axe murders in an Austen novel or any nasty elements. Her stories take place in small English towns and they all have a variety of characters including a few willful women and usually one male rogue.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's finest novel. That book is the perfect balance of story, prose, structure, and interesting characters. It evokes many emotional responses in the reader. That novel is among the greatest novels of all time on par with for example Flaubert's \\"Madame Bovary\\" or Tolstoy's \\"Anna Karenina.\\" From a strictly literary point of view, \\"Mansfield Park\\" is the most complicated and sophisticated literary work penned by Austen.<br /><br />So, where does that leave \\"Northanger Abbey\\" among her works? All of her five mature novels share a certain fixed writing style and a common structure, or the Austen formula as mentioned above. She uses the early pages to introduce the families, and other characters, and give start the story. She moves characters around from place to place in part for time shifting. She does a wrap up in the last few chapters. This is her sixth major work but written earlier. That Austen formula is partially present in the plot and structure. The first half of the novel is good. Catherine is a sympathetic protagonist and John Thorpe is a suitable rogue. Her love interest, Henry Tilney, seems a bit weak or enigmatic. The story is good for about half the novel. When the action moves to the Abbey it seems to become very fragmented and disorienting for the reader. But the Abbey section is not too long, and then story returns to more what we would expect from Austen near the end.<br /><br />Most Austen fans will find the piece to be interesting but a bit confusing in parts and not her best.jor work but written earlier.

B000QUTK6Y|4.0|Though not as good as it's companion piece, Flags takes a unique perspective of WWII.  War is depressing, tragic, and horrible.  It may be something that we have to participate in because of circumstances, but I think the message is that it isn't a simple solution and the price is high.  The film does suffer from lack of good characters which is surprising for an Eastwood film.  I liked the battle scenes and thought they were well done.  Overall Saving Ryan was better in some respects, but then it suffered from the contrivance of the German soldier killing the American soldier after he was let go. So yes the film is flawed but still worthwhile.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|because this cd is great. Its KC's best. Its thoughtful, reflective, its not a sad album, not really. Kelly Clarkson manages to keep things in perspective without subjecting herself to cynicism. Its too bad that it wasn't released in January like it was supposed to, because these songs are great. I can listen to this cd from beginning to end, and I've never done that with a KC album before. Never. In fact its very rare for me to listen to an album from beginning to end. I hope KC wins and gets her way with her label, its nice to know some artists are genuine and aren't puppets. My favorite songs are never again, one minute, how I feel, and  sober.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly's My December is her best cd yet and the best cd of the summer!!   It has beautiful lyrics written by kelly herself!   the songs are more mature sounding than Breakaway, and i like My december better!   It definiately has something for everyone because it has a variety of sounds on the record. Also, her voice is soo amazing on this record!    You won't be dissapointed! :)
B00005JPQT|4.0|In 1988 a little movie came out which would change the course of how movies were made. Actually, it wasn't any kind of movie, but action movies to be exact. It also introduced a new character to the movie landscape. The character was NYPD detective John McClane and the movie he was part of was Die Hard. This movie redefined the action movie and the action movie hero for a whole generation of film fans with it's tense and nonstop action in conjunction with an everyman hero-type who wasn't indestructible and who showed every cut, gash, bruise and damage he went through to try and save the day. The movie became a sensation and launched the career of one Mr. Bruce Willis. It was followed up by two more sequels (one great and the other one not-so great) over the years with the last one coming out in 1995. It is now 2007 and a dozen years has passed. 20th Century Fox has gone back to the well and came out with a third sequel titled Live Free or Die Hard (to be called Die Hard 4.0 overseas). This third sequel has a new director in Len Wiseman (of Underworld and Underworld: Evolution fame) with Bruce Willis reprising his role as the wisecracking NYPD detective John McClane. This third sequel has turned out better than I expected and I can honestly say it's way better than Die Hard with a Vengeance and on equal footing with the first two in the series.<br /><br />The movie begins with the premise of cyber-terrorists with the help of a group of unsuspecting hackers beginning the early stages of an attack on the U.S. National infrastructure. Using a script based on the Wired magazine article, A Farewell to Arms, Len Wiseman and crew do a great job of quickly establishing the main danger that's to face John McClane and the young hacker Matthew Farrell (played by Justin Long in the comedic sidekick role) throughout the length of the movie. The bad guys this time around revolve around one Thomas Gabriel (played by Deadwood's Timothy Olyphant) and his gang of hired mercenaries and cyber-terrorists. He plans to shutdown the entire United States through its infracstructure, financial centers, utilities and pretty much everything that's tied into the millions upon millions of computer systems which now run the entirety of the nation. Gabriel's motives looks to be one born out of revenge and the need to show that he was right, but this being a Die Hard movie there's always a hidden agenda that would be brought to light to signal the final reel of the film. Accompanying Gabriel is one Mai Lihn (played by the very sexy Maggie Q) who ends up giving John McClane more than he can handle in one of the many action sequences throughout the movie.<br /><br />The way Gabriel and his men attacks the national computer systems running everything in the United States looked very convincing. Whether it was gaining access and disrupting the traffic controls for both roads and airspace to systematically amping up the level of attacks both real and fake was enough to convince this viewer that this so-called virtual \\"firesale\\" on a nation's computer infrastructure is definitely plausible. And throughout all the many catastrophes caused by Gabriel and his men John McClane with hacker Farrell in tow must navigate through not just the hired mercenaries hired to be the muscle of the operation, but through the chaos created by Gabriel's cyber-attacks.<br /><br />John McClane has aged quite a bit since we last saw him trying to stop another group of \\"terrorists\\" from blowing up half of New York a little over a dozen years past. He has more than a little bit less hair and looks quite worn out and old. But for some reason he's once again in the wrong place at the wrong time and with no one else there to help him stop what's going on other than a geeky and unathletic hacker at his side, McClane really had to raise the heroism to levels not really seen in the previous three installments in the franchise. He gets more than his fair share of being shot at, blown up and beat to an inch of his life by acrobatic French assassins and martial-arts expert femme fatales. McClane gets bounced around and it shows, but he's like the Energizer Bunny who keeps on ticking no matter whats thrown at him. This time around what he's lost through the march of time and the creeping of old age he has gained through hard-fought knowledge. He's been around this block more than a few times and he seems to have learned enough to keep him and his charge alive.<br /><br />The work by Len Wiseman really shows that he knows how to shoot action scenes. He's no John McTiernan, but Wiseman seem to have seen enough of the movies in the franchise to know that Michael Bay-style direction is not what needed, but a throwback to how action movies were made using real stuntmen and vehicles was what would make this movie fun and exciting. For successfully pulling this project off I will admit that Wiseman may have been the best choice to make this movie. There wasn't much complexity in the script for Wiseman to work with but he got enough out of it to fill up two full hours of movie running time without boring the audience. That's quite an accomplishment compared to some of the more bloated films this summer, though quite enjoyable and fun on their own right, were still quite too long.<br /><br />In the end, Live Free or Die Hard is a step back in time to the golden age of action movies where what we saw on the screen was nonstop action done in pre-CGI ways with real non-CGI people. Bruce Willis brings back his John McClane and he comes back with a vengeance to wreak havoc once more on the bad guys attempts to get rich. For a summer blockbuster season of 2007 which has seen one blockbuster fail audience expectations in one way or another, Live Free or Die Hard lives up to all its expectations and actually turned out to be one of the movies of this summer. All it took was for an old action hero to make a comeback.acrobatic French assassins and martial-arts expert femme fatales.

Each lesson on a technique has a top border showing a color photo with samples of the bead or beads that can be made using the technique.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly Clarkson's third album, My December is chop-full of raw emotion and that's the way I like it. This cd got a lot of flack thanks to that irritating Clive Davis. I don't know what he was talking about but I think he wanted her to fail somehow but Kelly delivers on every song. I can't believe he didn't want to release this album, and yes the songs are catchy, real, and worth releasing as potential singles. Standout tracks include: Can I Have A Kiss, Irvine, Chivas, One Minute, Judas, Sober, Be Still, How I Feel and Maybe. Kelly is still the best American Idol and she proves this with her unique songwriting and you can hear her incredible range as a singer. She can hit all those high notes and then make you shiver when she slows it down and just sings from her soul. The music is better than ever, great guitar riffs, I just adore this album. Don't wait buy this album today. Happy Listening!
B000BEZQ0Y|5.0|I gotta tell you, the only thing better than Mr. Darcy confessing his love to Lizzy in the rain is listening to this score.  I absolutely love it--I espeically love picturing the scenes, which one can see so vividly while listening to the music.  It's beautiful.  My favorite tracks are 9 and 11.  Enjoy!
B000OCXMAE|4.0|First Off I keep hearing people saying that the cussing in this album makes it suck and I gotta say thats stupid as hell to belive since they only say f*** and barely at all the most is in Given Up. You live the exact same place as everyone else so get over the few cusswords, other than that this album shows a diffrent side of linkin park couple songs still got that original lp sound but then its also added new items which unlike most people keep saying dosent make it suck just goes to show you they can pull off more than the every day kinda of music your used to. To sum up this album for someone looking to buy it if you are a little kid you might wanna stay away but for anyone who has any sense of maturity its a good album.
B000P2A24W|5.0|As a Bon Jovi fan from the beginning, I was a little nervous about this one.  I live in Nashville and with the writing and recording of this CD done in Nashville, there was a lot of buzz around town about it being country.  Though I feel there is some country flair, they have also stayed true to themselves.  This is a CD that can be loved by many genres of music.  I love every song on the CD.  This is Bon Jovi's first #1 debut CD since \\"New Jersy\\" back in the late 80s.  I am VERY proud of them.  This CD is undeniably fantastic!  Barbie - Nashville, Tennessee

B00000DLT5|4.0|Van Halen back in the day was the truth. now I see alot of Bands being Proclaimed as the Best Rock and Roll Band in the world,etc... but there was a time when saying that title and Van halen in the same sentence truly was the truth. tracks like Running with the Devil, Eruption, you really got me going was the Jam. Eddie Van Halen changed the game on Guitar. he was something else back in the day,Michael Anthony on Bass was something else as well, Alex Van Halen on Drums was bringing it and One of the coolest Lead singers Ever Diamond David Lee Roth nailed down the vocals and was on point. this is a Debut album that still holds up some almost 30 years later.  strong solos, Grooves and Arrangements. you felt a Band that was on a Mission and from start to finish it's a very Good Collection. Van Halen brought in there own Bag of Rock and Roll.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|The quality of the sound of the dvd is not very good.  You have to strain to hear what the characters are saying.  That said, this is definitely not a top Bond film.  Disjointed and trite.  The Bond portrayed is not the suave, debonair figure we have come to love.    I am sorry I spent money on it.

I'd read it just for the end, which is spectacularly surprising, the only words i could say were Oh My God for several minutes. Although it's slightly unrealistic, it's still a good story and a wonderfully sad read.
0385522401|4.0|In reading more and more of McEwan's work, it is clear to see that he is a master of character.  In this slim volume we have a very simple set-up: a young husband and wife on their wedding night.  The bulk of the novel takes place over the course of a few hours from their private dinner (observed by a couple serving boys) to their move into the bedroom for the consummation of their marriage.<br /><br />As this is 1962, the husband and wife, Edward and Florence, are still virgins.  As McEwan gives us glimpses into their thoughts and history, we learn that the bedroom holds particular challenges for them both.  Nothing spectacular, just typical challenges for rather secluded British young people in the years before the sexual revolution.  And yet, it is McEwan's ability to articulate these typical challenges in such a believable way that makes the book so absorbing and makes Edward and Florence so real.<br /><br />In fact, it is the ordinariness of their encounter that makes most of the book so wonderful.  When the impact of their wedding night plays out so quickly in the last few pages of the book, the acceleration is a bit jarring.  But, still, not unexpected.  McEwan draws these characters so carefully and well that everything plays out in a believable way.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, considering the pleasures of the book, it would have been nice if McEwan could have drawn things out a bit.  Short stories and novellas masquerading as novels is a tiresome trend in the literature of a society driven into short attention spans.  On Chesil Beach feels in some ways like the opening section of a longer work than something complete unto itself.  Perhaps this is an unfair comparison, but with a masterpiece like Atonement already out there, it seems clear that McEwan could have gone farther.  Still, On Chesil Beach should not be missed.

0316067598|5.0|Having a voracious appetite to read ANYTHING about the SEALs, I couldn't wait to get this book.  It served to reaffirm what I have felt since I first heard about \\"The Teams\\" - these guys are my heroes.  This is one of the best SEAL books I have ever read.  Marcus does a great job of honoring his fallen comrades.  I've never met Danny, Mikey, Axe, Marcus or any of the brave soldiers who went to find them but I can honestly tell you that I think about them and their families daily.  I can't say that I agreed with all of Marcus' political opinions but he's earned the right to say whatever the heck he wants.  And by the way, because of guys like him, we also have that same right.  God bless all of our armed forces and their families.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|After having listened to Sky Blue Sky repeatedly, and seeing the band live, I feel I can appropriately review this album.  It is with great ease I say that this album is Wilco's finest, and that, surely, is saying a lot.  The production on this album was the first thing that jumped out at me.  The songs sound alive, the guitars sound warm and the vocals clear.  I've not heard anything sound this way since the Beatles on vinyl.  And it's not just a great sounding record - Tweedy has umped the ante with his songwriting, taking his seemingly endless bag of melodies and wrapping them around classic and jazzy chord progressions.  \\"Impossible Germany\\" as an example - three guitars harmonize and intertwine calmly, beautifully for 4:07 until they each break out into their own break down, with Nels Cline providing the solo and Jeff Tweedy the drive.  Without a doubt the most perfect song they've written thus far.  And so goes the album... songs as beautiful and alive as they come.  Well worth your time and money.
B000C1ZXEU|5.0|I very much enjoyed this book.  My bookclub, Reading Roses, read this as our June selectin and everyone really enjoyed it.

Good choice for a bookclub.
0316776963|4.0|The stories in this book are funny, there's no doubt about it, but I kept hearing that his writing was comparable to Augusten Burroughs so my expectations were much higher. While not as funny as Burroughs, the stories in this book were nothing shy of compelling and fun. Worth reading. I look forward to reading more of his work in the future.
B000002N9L|4.0|At the time, Prince was embroiled in a very nasty battle with Warner Brothers Records. So, he handed over this album of music originally intended \\"for private use only\\" (whatever that means) in order to finally meet the contract (although WB would eventually issue another collection of unrelaesed material). What is surprising is that the album is far better than you would expect, or that Amazon's review indicates.    Prince here delivers music that is suprisingly accessible, straightforward and diverse. He's not nearly as eccentric or quirky as usual, but that's fine. As most everyone has pointed ot, the best thing about the album is that Prince's sometimes underrated rock guitar skills really come to the fore here. The powerhouse title track gets things going with a bang, Prince searing guitar perfectly complementing the angry lyric. Prince sexual preoccuaptions (although less blatant than usual)also get the hard rocking treatment in the next track, \\"I Like It There.\\" \\"The Same December\\" also kicks butt.    However, the album is more tham just rock. \\"Dinner with Delores\\" is a charming, whimsical pop tune with an acoustic base.  Southern soul shows up, suprisingly, in another stab at social commentary, \\"Right the Wrong\\". Blues-rock is featured in the sexy \\"Zannalee\\". The Artist's sprituality gets a beautiful showcase with the uplifting \\"Into The Light\\", starting with a gentle piano part before rocking it out again.  Prince pretty much forgoes the hip-hop of his most recent albums, with the one exception of \\"I Rock, Therefore I Am\\", which might sound like an egotist manifesto,   but actually sounds like Prince is delivering it entirely tongue-in-cheek. It goes on a bit too long, but it has Prince's usually solid musical base, an amusing rap by the NPG's Tony D. and great vocals from Rosie Gaines.    The album takes a positively vicious turn at the end with the jittery funk of \\"Dig You Better Dead\\" and the dark, classical sounding \\"Had You.\\"  They sound like kiss-offsto an old girlfriend, but could also be interpreted as giving the big middle finger to WB...    Anyway, while this album, certainly doesn't have the scope of the those from his classic period (from \\"1999\\" to \\"Sign of the Times\\"), it has a lot of what made those albums great, with none of the annoying filler that occasionally would drag them down. Unfortuantely, being the last album of his contract, WB wasn't motivated to promote it, and Prince himself had moved on by the time it came out, so it was a commercial failure. So, it's out of print, which is a shame. Anyone who enjoyed the best of Prince's 1980's work will like this strong collection.
014305841X|4.0|Pollan takes us on a fascinating journey. He explores the origins of four meals: an industrial meal (McDonald's), an industrial-organic meal (many of the foods labeled organic in the grocery store but using industrial, mass-production techniques), a \\"true\\" organic meal, and a meal that he personally hunted and gathered.    In the first section, I learned a lot about the industrial food industry, in particular (a) exactly how much of our food is based in corn one way or another (a staggering amount), and (b) how much petroleum producing our food takes (a similarly staggering amount). [This is the part where we learn most about the science.] In part two, Pollan opened my eyes to much of what is labeled \\"organic\\" at grocery stores: it's not what most of us (perhaps naively) think of as organic at all, very insightful. Part three, the \\"true\\" organic section, focuses on one farm that he feels really captures the concept of sustainability. Whether that model is replicable on a large scale is unclear, but the farm owner's philosophy is interesting, and living with Pollan on such a farm for a while is wildly refreshing. The last section, in which Pollan hunts a boar, gathers mushrooms, etc., speaks less to how we can transform our food industry and more to how engaging with our food deeply can affect us. The reflections are worthwhile. This book, like a tasty mix of [[ASIN:0060838582 Fast Food Nation]] and something by [[ASIN:0865470529 Wendell Berry]], helped me to think carefully about what I consume (at least until I was able to suppress those thoughts and get back to my hot dogs).    I listened to the unabridged audiobook narrated by Scott Brick. His reading, especially in the first part describing the composition of industrial food, came across too preachy, like a mediocre, annoying, but enthusiastic preacher. He was better with the personal experiences emphasized later.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|I dont know whats added onto the extended cut, but I still enjoyed it. Nicolas Cage doesnt seem to be a guy to play a super hero. Then again, neither does George Clooney. Did this movie stink like Batman and Robin? Hell no! He plays it well but its not the best performance. When he transforms in Ghost Rider, those are the best scenes. The movie is cheesy at points and the acting is a bit weak, but I loved the speical effects. I havent heard of a sequel, but I think it would be cool.
0140187537|4.0|If I had never read so many of his other works, I would probably rate this fine classic five stars.  I rate it just under four and a half stars solely because I don't think it quite compares to \\"East of Eden\\" and \\"The Grapes of Wrath\\".  These are times in which I wish Amazon had a ten point scale rating system instead of five.  How can I honestly give this novel the same rating as the two above referenced classics?  Yet, please don't get wrong, I did thoroughly enjoy this book, especially the second half.  What I love most about Steinbeck is that he is truly an American through and through.  Which makes him very easy for me, an American, to identify with.  I also enjoy the fact that he was an artist that lived among the people (just like, and arguably even more so than Mr. Hemingway).  This is a very attractive trait, in my opinion, when it comes to writing the dialogue between the characters.  Steinbeck has the language and the mannerisms of the common man down to a tee.<br /><br />Three quotes I would like to add here.  The first quote, will be the best I can think of when it comes to defining the story of Steinbeck's hero in the novel - Ethan Hawley.  The second two quotes are two of my personal favorites from this novel, while they also aid in re-defining the book's main message.<br /><br />\\"For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?\\"  Mark 8:36<br /><br />\\"Any man of reasonable intelligence can make money if that's what he wants.  Mostly it's women or clothes or admiration he really wants and they deflect him.  The great artists of finance like Morgan and Rockefeller weren't deflected.  They wanted and got money, just simple money.  What they did with it afterward is another matter.\\" (p. 45)<br /><br />\\"Strength and success - they are above morality, above criticism.  It seems, then, that it is not what you do, but how you do it and what you call it.  Is there a check in men, deep in them, that stops or punishes?  There doesn't seem to be.  The only punishment is failure.  In effect no crime is committed unless a criminal is caught.\\"  (p. 187)<br /><br />I am huge Steinbeck fan, and I have read quite a bit of his work.  In \\"The Winter of Our Discontent\\", he has definitely created in Ethan Hawley a main character that I myself can relate with like none other.  I have just become a husband and father.  I work in the world of real estate (not as a broker or agent) in the Silicon Valley in Northern California (a.k.a. hades, everlasting fire, nether world, etc...) where attempting to be a man of morality, a man with principals and ethics, is not very easy to say the least.  Especially when you are the only breadwinner and you live in one of the most expensive towns.  Like Ethan, I am plagued daily by temptations that could easily make me richer and 'more successful' such as kick backs, black mail, cougar women (i.e. Margie Young-Hunt), shady deals, etc... yet, so far, I have been able to hold my ground.  For those of you who haven't read this fine novel, that is what you must now find out for yourself.  Will Ethan, after years upon years of being Mr. Nice Guy, a man who is going nowhere fast as a grocery clerk, a man that can barely manage to make ends meet for his family, will Ethan finally throw in the towel and join them?  God knows he has the pedigree, the smarts, the wherewithal to be a success, the question is whether or not he wants to sell his soul to do so.<br /><br />Fans of Steinbeck's I can assure you that you will find this novel more enjoyable as long as you don't have the expectations of it being in the same league as those two above referenced classics.  I still easily put this in my top ten favorites of all his work.  My two only knocks (which are in no way a deterrent for reading this) are one, the lack of character development for everyone but Ethan and Margie, you really only get to know the other characters on more of a superficial, less than penetrating level.Which was a bit disheartening, because I really wanted to get to know some of these people more than he allowed me to.  The other knock is that much of the book's plot was a bit too transparent for me.  I was almost able to forecast everything that was going to transpire in the novel after reading the first forty pages.  However, those are two very minor distasteful details when you consider who the author is.  John Steinbeck could write a story about professional fly swatters stranded in a desert and still make it interesting.  So I hope you all enjoy another little treasure from one of America's greatest twentieth century writers and definitely one of my personal favorites.  Damn it!  I really want to give this five stars!<br /><br />ENJOY!really wanted to get to know some of these people more than he allowed me to.

0618680004|5.0|Having just finished reading one of the most celebrated books of the last several years, I might be inclined to write a long, arduous, and perhaps boring review.      Cutting to the chase: Whether you are religious or not should not matter; this is a book you should read with a genuinely open mind. For many of us, this is not easy, but it is necessary.  Not since Carl Sagan have we had anyone combine the complex intricacies of religion and science.  Do not be thrown by Dawkins' utter dislike of religion.  His passion for human survival and its eventual success is his obvious motivation in writing this book, not his dislike of deities, gods, and priests (although it is clear that religion upsets him, in general).  Until I read this book, I always thought of Dawkins as the British counterpart of Steven Jay Gould.  After The God Delusion, I no longer feel this is true.  He has written a work that will stand the test of time, and hopefully be read seriously by the entire planet.  Our species will only benefit from its education.
0618680004|4.0|Not that I didn't like the book, because I did, but Dawkins just flat-out refuses to be something other than a materialist.  He doesn't believe in anything he can't measure with a probe or an instrument.  So, the whole concept of Spirit (and where was Consciousness?) is left out.  I mean, the whole history of spiritual development carried out by the ancient philosophers (who hardly ever addressed the concept of God, considering it too difficult to grapple with, so, why waste the time...) is never addressed.<br /><br />Now, he did a great job of laying out his argument against the existence of a personal Deity (which makes sense, since a personal deity doesn't), and there is plenty to think about and consider, and yes, he's right about the divisive and destructive nature of religion, but jeez, c'mon, to revel in Atheism the way he does is as faith-based as the Believers.  It bothered me that he dealt with Buddhism (and, by association Taoism, which simply describes the One Great Integral Universal 'Way') in a single sentence, discounting it as a psychology (which it is, but not only).  But then he saves all his vitriol for the three big ones, Judaism, Christianity, and Islam -- and rightfully so.  The adoration he lays on Darwin, however, makes up for his lack of scope in recognizing the possibility of any other Greater Intelligence(s).  And that's not to say that evolution isn't a great and wonderful (and powerful) thing, but it's a process, and even Darwin himself never expected anyone to worship Evolution as \\"The\\" Process.<br /><br />It was a good book (how ironic, considering what he had to say about The Good Book) but as good as his arguments are (and I'm a scientist too: Anthropology / Archaeologist), I remained unconvinced, or rather, more open-minded -- he doth protest a bit too much.  Think about it -- if there are lesser graduated intelligences (ants, fish, reptiles, mammals, etc.), and we are (currently) the only self-aware (conscious; sentient?) intelligence we know, why can't there be other 'higher' intelligences?  Would they not appear as 'gods' to us?  It's like magic, which is not manipulating the supernatural, it's just the science of which we are not yet aware (e.g., a pack of matches in 500 B.C would make you a royal 'magician').  I think I'll stick with a healthy diet of Science, Agnosticism, Curiosity, and Ancient Philosophy to carry me through. Would I recommend it?  Yes, of course.  I'm not suggesting Dawkins is dumb, just getting set in his ways, as most famous scientists do when they get older.can't there be other 'higher' intelligences?

B00005JPFE|5.0|I thought Monsters Inc. was spectacular, but this movie really put me over the edge.  I was blown away and my expectations were exceeded.  The depth of personality and expression presented by all the characters is amazing and captivating.  It really sucks you in to the movie.  I love the CG work, just amazing candy to the eye.  I would watch this movie again and again.  The cuteness of Remy, Emile, and Linguini is hard to resist!
B000001DYY|4.0|(true story) I worked at a bike shop where we listened to this record nearly everyday for an entire summer.  we each got to pick a cd to play and Jack's pick was frequently Elemental by Tears for Fears.  (You all should go buy it...last I checked it was only $0.05 on Amazon)<br />What I realized throughout this summer was that I was developing a very clear image as to what was going on visually during this record...and that was the full coreography of the CATS broadway musical.  If you could go to the musical and listen to this album (you know kind of like dark side of the moon and wizard of Oz) I think you would be in for a treat.<br />Also, Jack was gay.
B0000AKCLS|5.0|This is my first intro to Joe Bonamassa, a recommendation I thought I'd give a try...DAMN... where have I been all this time!!!  This guy rips, smokes and tears from one track to another, begining to end.  Try to imagine a mixture of Joe Satriani's guitar-technique pyrotechnics meeting Buddy Guy's pure blues mastery.  Too hard to imagine?  You don't have to.  Simply buy this cd, and you'll get the picture.  Incredible talent and accomplishment for a guitarist/musicician only in his mid-twenty's.  Besides the axe-work, what really sells the authenticity of a genuine bluesman is Bonamassa's smokey, aged-in-a barrell, \\"mature sounding\\" vocal quality; his voice sounds as though he has lived a much longer/much rougher life than his actual age belies.  Enough talk..just buy it.
B000002KBU|5.0|As a singer growing up in the sixties, I was heavily influenced by Joni Mitchell--her vocal style, her complex melodies, the gorgeous poetry of her lyrics.  Very few singers today can begin to approach the artistry of a woman whose career has spanned decades and to whom countless artists give an admiring nod as having been a profound influence on their own music.    This is as good as it gets.  I felt that way 30 years ago and I still feel that way today. If I had only one CD to take with me to a deserted island, this would be it.    In my opinion, the only younger artist out there today that has her kind of writing and singing chops is John Mayer.  He gives me hope that the timeless music of artists like Joni and The Beatles (to name only two of many) will continue to be made, however grim the music business might look.
1400063515|5.0|An excellent book well worth the read. For anyone on the fence trying to decide if they might be interested, I would recommend listening to a podcast interview with Nassim Taleb by Russell Roberts over at EconTalk. It's about an hour and gives a great overview of the general ideas behind the book.
B000000ORX|5.0|Who else but Joni Mitchell can create a song that takes you from your daylit, traffic bogged SUV to a country road at night with the stars above.  That's one of her strongest gifts--transformation.  Joni takes you places you've never been before.  \\"Night ride home\\" is one of her best.

B000069HKH|5.0|\\"Into the Fire,\\" \\"Waiting On A Sunny Day\\", \\"Counting on a Miracle\\" all of them are Springsteen's version of Prozac for fans.  Yeah, the theme's pretty repetitive, but I'm certain when the next blue Monday rolls around, I'm going to find a lot of this album useful.  It's not \\"Born in the USA\\" or \\"Asbury Park\\" but it's still Springsteen and it's still well above the crowd.
0060987464|4.0|I've always been fascinated with reading \\"Rock Star\\" biographies. For the most part, they've mainly been written by other people - which in some ways puts a damper on thing, as I would like to \\"get inside\\" the artist's head, and possibly look at how they \\"tick\\". Unlike, the last biography I've read - which was Ozzy Osbourne's - I found Marilyn Manson's to be quite engrossing to say the least. Personally I think that the majority of people are afraid of things which look different to them, because they are scared of uncovering the facts which will bring it into focus, and therefore make it seem normal. Mr Manson is no different. He starts out as a regular kid - and bing curious and inquisitive as children are, sets out to uncover the secrets lying in his grandfather's basement. What he discovers down there - changes his view on society's norms, and paves the way for what he will become today. I've never felt \\"freaked out\\" by Manson, nor can I say I'm his biggest fan. But I do have respect for the guy, and I think that before people start shooting their mouths of on a topic they probably don't know ANYthing about - they should at least have the decencey to sit down and read this book. Who knows. Maybe they'll start to educate their close-minded friends on a man who isn't that different after all.    PS: I didn't realize till after reading it that it was written in the late 90's. It would have been good to see Manson describe & reflect on his relationships with Rose McGowan, Dita von Teese & lately Evan Rachel Wood. As I'm interested to know about how him & Rachel came about, other than reading about it in Rolling Stone.
B00005OMTT|5.0|I ignored the numerous suggestions to buy Enigma til I found LSD in a used record store.  The price was good and I figured I had nothing to lose.  Wow--did I get a good deal!  The CD is amazing, the music's varied and I get a good taste of what I should have bought long ago.  I really can't add more to the excellent reviews already in place, but if you love world and fusion type music, you need to give this CD a try--and yes, it's worth full price.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|I'll say one thing about Kelly Clarkson that I think no one will deny her - she has a phenomenal voice. She's proven that she can rock, pour her heart out in a cover of a soul song, or be a dance-teen pop chanteuse.  The girl is multidimensional, and I think that is one reason why I am a fan of her. I loved the Grammy-nominated \\"Miss Independent\\" from 2003's double platinum THANKFUL, and I truly fell for all five singles gracing her unexpected five-times platinum smash BREAKWAY, spawning five top twenty hits with four out of the five all peaking in the top ten.  MY DECEMBER, I have to say, gave me a questionable feeling from the get go, particular with first single \\"Never Again\\".  After such a megahit as \\"Since U Been Gone\\", you can't expect Clarkson to top it, but \\"Never Again\\" was completely different, making me wonder about Clarkson's motives. Her motives are clearly to drop all hints of pop and go straight rock, which I think is perhaps a bit too dramaticof a change for Clarkson. MY DECEMBER suffers from a lack of truly lighter tracks that are fun as opposed to so heavy.  Don't get me wrong, Clarkson still sounds good (even though often she pushes too much with her voice), but the material just isn't always a gripping or nearly as fun as anything on either of Clarkson's two previous albums.<br /><br />\\"Never Again\\" is the first sign that MY DECEMBER is definitely like neither of Kelly's previous albums.  The track is sound enough and even catchy - after a couple of listens - but it doesn't incite the listener to belt it out quite like Clarkson's previous singles. The production is great, which helps, but it is still an adjustment to hear the pop chanteuse completely rocking out with not a trace of pop anywhere.  What is unfortunate for MY DECEMBER is is that \\"Never Again\\" just may be the single \\"hit\\" of the album.  Second track, \\"One Minute\\" isn't quite as strong, but it is consistent for the most part. \\"One Minute\\" sits in the spot on the track list where Kelly's biggest comparison track, \\"Since U Been Gone\\" sat on BREAKAWAY.  It doesn't even hope to compare, perhaps the reason why Clarkson chose the Nine Inch Sounding Nails affair to be placed at the forefront of the album. While it is certainly competent and strong enough, it is overproduced, a trend that MY DECEMBER barely bucks.<br />\\"Hole\\" isn't bad either, though it's hard to truly latch on or feel any connection as a listener to this song.  \\"Sober\\" is better in my opinion, especially since the producers strip it down as compared to the first three tracks.  Despite some of the \\"blandness\\" of \\"Sober\\", Clarkson saves the song from utter death with grand powerhouse vocals at the tail end. So far, BREAKAWAY has failed to be trumped by MY DECEMBER.<br /><br />The album cycles through a couple of sound alikes and songs that lack true distinction following the strongers four tracks of the album.  \\"Don't Waste Your Time\\" is solid, but nothing new while \\"Judas\\" sounds like a B-side based off of \\"Never Again\\" with blander songwriting.  \\"Haunted\\" is fine, but it doesn't really resonate.  \\"Be Still\\" slows down the pace a builds a bit more momentum in my eyes, even if it is only the slightest bit of momentum at that.  \\"Maybe\\" is a clear miss, the very first of the album, while the remainder of the songs (\\"How I Feel\\", \\"Yeah\\", \\"Can I Have A Kiss\\", and \\"Irvine\\"), are average at most.  Those tracks aren't bad, but compare any of the above-mentioned against \\"Breakaway\\", \\"Since U Been Gone\\", \\"Behind These Hazel Eyes\\", \\"Because of You\\", or even the lesser \\"Walk Away\\", and you clearly have a downgrade in quality. Say what you will, this album may be Clarkson's first misstep.<br /><br />I honestly was disappointed because up until this point, I thought the direction of Clarkson's career was on the up and up.  But with the dark leanings and pseudo-goth 'inflections' within MY DECEMBER, I feel like Clarkson has lost a part of her identity. Yes, \\"Since U Been Gone\\" could kick \\"Miss Independent's\\" butt all day, but with a voice as strong and multi-faceted as Clarkson's, she shouldn't shed her pop image completely.  Best of luck on the fourth album Ms. Clarkson;  I have no doubt MY DECEMBER shall be a big hit for you, despite it's downgrade in quality of material. 3 stars.t with a voice as strong and multi-faceted as Clarkson's, she shouldn't shed her pop image completely.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|This is the only one I've listened to through and bought.  It's a good solid listening experience.     My big complaint is that this CD will not rip to my iPod on either a Mac or a Windows-based system.  I'm not sure what disc protection schema they're using, but I bought this CD in hard copy so I could rip it down and carry it with me via the iPod and it's pretty disappointing that I can't do what I want with music I thought I'd purchased the rights for my own use.
B00005QDW5|5.0|Most would think that would be DSOTM.  It's a close call.  But, since this set has most of the best cuts from DSOTM, and the best cuts from every other release, this would be my choice.    Disc 2 of this set has been my bedtime CD for over a year now.    Only two comments.  I could do without \\"Bike\\".  That song just creeps me out, especially the freaky noise at the very end.    Secondly, I'm disappointed that they cut Gilmours Blues solo in SOYCD.    I still give it 5 stars though.    EDIT: BTW... If you are a guitar player, there is what is probably one of the best TAB books ever produced for this album.  It covers every song, exactly, and has every Gilmour solo.    http://www.amazon.com/Pink-Floyd-Echoes-Best/dp/0757908039/ref=pd_bbs_2/104-3072233-2244740?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1184174143&sr=8-2    Unfortunately, it is out of print so you will have to go with a listed used copy.    I'd get it while you can.
0060578793|5.0|I recently purchased the backpack edition of this book and have really enjoyed it. It's highly informative, easy to understand, and has the potential to save the life of anyone who reads it. There's the odd mistake, such as using barrel cacti as a source of water in the desert, when only some species are safe to drink from (thanks to Ray Mears for that tidbit in his Survival series), but overall you will come away from reading this book with knowledge that will prolong your life in a survival situation. I'd recommend the backpack edition as it fits nicely in the side pocket of a rucksack, but has the full text of the original. Seal this book in a waterproof bag, and take it with you when traveling off the beaten path.
0060005688|5.0|Some parts get a little complicated for just a quick read. But, at 240 pages this is a a fun look at the societal and psychological issues we face.<br /><br />The areas explored are summed up with the following:<br /><br />\\"...our experience of choice as a burden rather than a privilege is not a simple phenomenon. Rather it is the result of a complex interaction among many psychological processes that permeate our culture, including rising expectations, awareness of opportunity costs, aversion to trade-offs, adaptation, regret, self-blame, the tendency to engage in social comparisons, and maximizing.\\"<br /><br />The last chapter goes on to highlight and explain how we can try to avoid these issues (regret leading to depression, leading to suicide; comparing to neighbors and having regret; post-decision regret). A lot of it has to do with accepting \\"good enough\\".<br /><br />Again, I recommend the book because it may help you see your decisions a little differently. At the same time, it helps understand the psychology behind others' decisions.
B000OZ2CZW|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but  I was just so plesantly suprised by this album that I felt compelled to write one. I own Rihanna's other albums and liked some of her songs but wouldn't have really considered myself a big fan-until now. I really wasn't expecting much when I bought this album, I thought this would be like her two other albums where half of the songs are good and the rest are just mediocre/below average but I was wrong, this album is fantastic!    The first time I listened to it, I didn't feel compelled to skip not even ONE track and that rarely happens with me. This album is filled with fun,catchy songs and I HIGHLY reccomend this to anyone.    Top 5 fave songs    *Umbrella-This song picked up fast and just seems to be getting bigger and bigger all the time. This has been a massive hit for Rihanna. It's a great song and doesn't sound like anything else out on radio right now.     *Don't Stop The Music-INCREDIBLY CATCHY! This is one of the best dance tracks I've heard in years and Rihanna makes great use of MJ's \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\" sample, he is one of my fave artists btw so this sample made me just love this song even more. Man, this song is so damn catchy though! If this song doesn't make you feel like dancing then you should check your pulse! Seriously lol it's impossible to not dance when this song comes on. This song alone is worth buying the album for.      *Push Up On Me-Kind of a techno vibe, catchy song and fun to sing along to.    *Hate That I Love You-Nice collboration with Ne-Yo. Their voices compliment eachother very well. Love this song!    *Say It-Nice use of Mad Cobra's \\"Flex\\" in this. I've always love that Mad Cobra song and it works very well in this song.    Bonus    *Rehab-Justin Timberlake did a nice job writing this song (or co-writing this, not sure) but anyway, I like the lyrics and it has a kind of alternative sound to it. It works very well for Rihanna's voice.    All in all, I just think this album is fantastic! It's great fun and pretty much all the songs on here are good. I HIGHLY reccomend this.
0812975219|5.0|2nd edition (2004), 316 pages (of which 262 pages for the book)    I read the first edition of Taleb's book a couple of years ago and remember thinking it was one of the best books I'd read - one that would definitely make my all time top ten. I found the concept of alternate outcomes and alternate histories (that what did happen was not necessarily what could have happened) an instantly and outstandingly useful way of making more sense of the world. I suspect most of us have some vague or even more than vague, idea of this (particularly those drawn to reading this book) - but it is different when someone shoves it in front of you in such a succinct and brilliant fashion.     I no longer have my copy of the first edition (having loaned it to someone who lost it) so I can't do direct comparisons and don't have my underlinings and scribblings from the original. However, in the preface Taleb talks about some of his changes/additions and says specifically that the second edition is more than a third longer than the original.     He also mentions that one of his friends begged him not to revise the book for the second edition. That reminds me of the situation with Dawkins' Selfish Gene. When he revised the book for the second edition he (and from memory, I think also the publishers) didn't want to damage the flow or impact from the original, so he contented himself with adding material as separate endnote chapters.     I suspect that Taleb might have been better off taking the same approach. I have to be careful, though, as a second reading of an outstandingly original book is never going to have the same impact as the first - and I don't have my original to make specific comparisons. However, I think it likely that some of the power of the original has been lost. (One can easily justify each addition, but eventually the changes may detract from the whole, or, as Garrett Hardin puts it: \\"one can never do merely one thing.\\")    That (potential) carping aside, Fooled by Randomness is still an exceptionally wise and useful book. Do yourself a big favour and read it - though it might be worth looking for a copy of the first edition.
0375714669|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed \\"Persepolis\\". \\"Persepolis 2\\" is a bit more difficult to love since it is not based on the perceptions of a child. However, it is also quite good and is worth your time to read about this young woman who feels hated in the West since she is Iranian (presumed terrorist/extremist) and is hassled in Iran for being too Western.<br /><br />I was pleased to find that Amazon has prepared a site for the movie edition of the book, due to come out this fall. A little research told me that, indeed, there is a movie due to be released - by Sony - and done in the same comic book style as the the book, according to the stills I found. I'll be there. It will be interesting to see the reaction to it by the government of Iran.<br /><br />I give \\"Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return\\" a grade of B+.
B0000024KQ|4.0|Ah yes.  All We Got Iz Us.  When this joint came out, I was skeptical because I didn't really feel [[ASIN:B0000024IG Bacdafucup]] like most folks did back in '93.  I found their constant screaming somewhat gimmicky.  Similar to Das Efx, there were a lot of cats biting their style  back the early 90's.  Just like cats were jacking the \\"iggety\\" from Das, cats were screaming all over their records after they saw how many units Onyx moved on their debut.  When I first heard \\"Last Dayz\\" I was hyped up because they weren't yelling and they still came off crazy hard.  I copped every single from this album as well as the entire album on vinyl and CD.  The production is what I love most about this album.  Surprisingly, the entire album is produced by Fredro himself (Sticky produces one track).  That shocked me because I didn't even know he made beats and these beats are super dope.<br /><br />There aren't many flaws because the album, despite a distinctly east coast/early 90's sound, has matured very well over the years.  If anything, there are moments when the members of Onyx regress into their gimmicky screams, but it's totally tolerable because the production is better than it was on their debut and all three members rip their verses.<br /><br />All We Got Iz Us is still the best Onyx release out there.  They are still puttin' in work on the independent level, but they haven't come close to topping this album 13 years after its release.  Like one reviewer said already, there's no filler, no fluff, and no radio friendly singles.  It's just Onyx ripping track after grimy track.  If you like your rap hard or if you dig that early 90's east coast style then I highly recommend adding this CD to your music library.<br /><br />Standout Tracks: Purse Snatchaz, Live Nig*z, Last Dayz (My Favorite), All We Got Iz Us (Evil Streets), Punkmotherf*kaz
B000O178BY|2.0|I got the new cd and tried to introduce NIN to my girlfriend, but what came out was far worse than I could have imagined. There are a couple quality songs on the album, but ALL of them are ruined by ridiculously high-pitched beats or abrupt, annoying sound effects that really didn't need to be in the song at all. As hard as it was, I listened to the entire cd.     Sure enough, I take the cd out and put in \\"With Teeth\\" and \\"Downward Spiral\\" and my girlfriend goes \\"Oh yeah, now THIS is good!\\"    I didn't even care if my gf liked it or not, I was just shocked that a NIN cd could make my ears bleed like that... I've been listening to their stuff (all of it) for 10+ years now, if you are unsure just download a song or two or borrow someone else's cd, listen for yourself before you pay for this album.
B000GFLAI0|5.0|For 40+ years, Bob Dylan has spilled my heart, stripped bare my soul and rattled my complacent mind. Modern Times reassures and re-inspires. Aging we may be but still relevant: older, wiser, gentler, more tolerant and deeply clarified about the daily human commonalities that join us all. Just when fans think they have a handle on Bob Dylan, he shifts gears and opens his reach in a new direction letting us know that the rest of us can do the same. No other artist steps as unfailingly in rhythm with my generation as Bobby D. He knows where we are, who we are, and I hope, in the still of the night, I'll be with you, Bob, When the Deal Goes Down.  Like Highway 61 Revisited and Blood on the Tracks, Modern Times calls us to A New Morning.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|The quiet introduction of a watercolorist at work, sparkling with swirls of vivid color, set the mood for this wonderful, gentle film. The settings were a feast for the eyes, and the story development moved at an satisfactorily eighteenth century pace, but the impeccable characters, wonderfully played, are the life-blood of this movie. The brisk energy of Beatrix [Zellweger], the engaging smile of Norman Warne [MacGregor], and the directness and kindness of Millie [Watson] created a marvelous chemisty.  In joy and in sorrow, each character rang true.  Though a less central character, Lloyd Owens adds value in his role as Willie Heelis as well. Potter's indomitable spirit, however, is what keeps this movie from sinking into mere romanticism. In spite of pain, disapproval, and deep loss, she found happiness in her art and in her determination to live life forward. It is more than a feel-good movie; it is an inspiration to courageous living wrapped in delightful artistry.

B0008ENHTE|4.0|Bullitt is an intense and suspenseful crime drama that features the famous car chase through San Francisco.<br /><br />Steve McQueen is memorable in the lead role, with excellent support from Don Gordon as his partner, Delgetti, and Robert Vaughn as the powerful 'good guy / bad guy'.  Look also for Norman Fell in a smaller role as a hardened police captain and a younger Robert Duvall as a cab driver.<br /><br />Most people remember Bullitt for its car chase sequence, for better or for worse.  It's good fun with a number of known continuity errors (passing the green VW Beetle at least three times, as well as the white car (Pontiac?)) and that black Dodge Charger must have about eight hubcaps on it, I swear, since about four fall off and later they seem to be back on. (Or did cars have two sets of hubcaps as standard equipment back then?) ;-)  In any case, it's a must-see for classic muscle car fans, and the best moments are the \\"you are there\\" moments filmed over the drivers' shoulders.<br /><br />Beyond that, Bullitt's enduring charm is its heavy atmosphere, rather than its dialogue or character development.  At times, it seems so real that it almost feels like a documentary.  You are taken behind the scenes into the medical and police worlds of the late 1960's.<br /><br />The plot has enough twists to keep you going.  However, by today's standards, some of the scenes could've been left out.  I realize that the film tries to show the main character as both a distant maverick as well as a human being, but a number of scenes and subplots could've been edited out in favor of a tighter plot.  I mean, do we need to watch Bullitt in a restaurant or grocery shopping or in forced, flat dialogue with his lover?  I felt that these moments detracted from the film, rather than adding to it.<br /><br />The soundtrack works well for the era, as composed by Lalo Schifrin.  The opening titles is one of my favorite movie themes.  It's jazzy and it fits the film well.<br /><br />My favorite part of the film is its opening sequence.  The titles are blended in creatively with the plot, which begins immediately.  That, with the already mentioned music, creates the most enduring impression with me.<br /><br />Bullitt is not a perfect movie, and not quite the classic that some would make it to be, but it's definitely worth seeing and owning..

B00005O5CM|5.0|Based on the novel of the same name by Amanda Brown, this 2001 comedy is about the losses and gains  experienced by a priviledged young woman from California, and her ultimate self-empowerment.   Elle Woods(as played by a multi-dimensional Reese Witherspoon) is the President of her Sorority, Delta Nu. A neighbor of TV producer Aaron Spelling during her formative years, her world revolves around fashion and frivolity, although  we see signs of underlying intelligence when a sales clerk who views her as \\"a dumb blonde with Daddy's plastic\\" is taught a lesson.   We meet the beloved Sorority Queen on the day she expects a proposal from her long-time boy friend, Warner Huntington III (Matthew Davis). Instead of a marriage proposal, Warner breaks up with Elle during their evening out, explaining that his family back East expect a lot from him, and that marrying a \\"Jackie\\" instead of a \\"Marilyn\\" will be more conducive to his family's desires, if he wants to be a Senator.    The spurned young woman spends the next few days behind the closed doors of her dorm room, with only her chiahuahua/favorite accessory Bruiser (Moonie) for companionship. Her stereotypically ditzy sorority sisters, Margot and Serena (Jessica Caufiell, Alanna Ubach) finally draw her out of her pink cocoon, and take her for a manicure. There is a comical moment where Serena converses in Chinese with a manicurist, which gives her a little more depth. While reading a \\"Fox and Hound\\" magazine in the waiting room, Elle sees a photo of Warner's brother with his fiancee, breifly discusses the fiancee's credentials with the customer sitting next to her(Natalie Barish), and decides to attend Harvard Law School to win Warner back.   Elle's parents (James Read, and Tane McClure) are not very encouraging in this endeavor, nor is her advisor (Allyce Beasley) as Elle does not have the academic background for it.  Still, she passes her LSAT test, and sends and admissions video, for which it requires some suspension of disbelief to think that the pop-eyed, bow-tied Admissions Committee would deem acceptable.   Elle creates quite a stir upon her arrival at Harvard, but remains fairly oblivious to comments and stares about her eccentricities in manner and dress.   She finally locates Warner, who is stunned that she got into Harvard, and during a class for which she is ill-prepared, is shown up by a small, pallid, mahogony-tressed Vivian Kensington(Selma Blair), whom, to her great distress, she learns is Warner's fiancee.   Along the way, she receives help and advice from Emmett Richmond (a well-cast, kind, and encouraging Luke Wilson, whose performance hits all the right notes), and a cathartic chat with manicurist Paulette Bonafonte (Jennifer Coolidge), which will be bright spots along her journey.   Gradually, she overcomes rejection and humiliation by her classmates through perseverance, and attention to details others neglect, winning friends and influencing people.   She helps Paulette with a legal matter, and in getting a date with a handsome UPS guy (Bruce Thomas), and the mutual friendship between the law student and manicurist is a delightful cornerstone of this film.    Gradually, Vivian warms to her, and the two share a laugh about Warner's idiosyncracies.   One of Elle's more intriguing classmates--the character as well as the actor himself-- is the sweet, awkward David Kidney, portrayed by Oz Perkins, with the eyes of his father, Anthony, who does great justice to his acting pedigree. Sadly, he would only have a little more than a month to enjoy the success of this film before enduring the shattering loss of his mother, Berry Berenson, in the 9-11 Disaster.    Elle's opinionatedness in Professor Callahan's(Victor Garber's)class appears to earn her an internship with Callahan's law firm, and she, Warner, Vivian, David, and Enid Wexler(Meredith Scott Lynn) work on a murder case under Callahan's supervison. The task also reunites Elle with Emmett.   The case is a high profile one involving  the slaying of a wealthy 60-year-old man, allegedly by  his young second wife, Brooke Taylor Windham (Ali Larter), a member of Elle's sorority, and a wealthy fitness instructor of whom Elle was once a student.   Raquel Welch appears as the ex-wife of the murdered man, with a perfect upper-crust accent, Linda Cardellini is her daughter, Chutney, and Greg Serano is the pool boy, Enrique Salvatore.   There are comical moments when Elle tries to coax an alibi from Brooke, bringing her a basket of beauty aids and \\" the Bible\\" (a copy of \\"Cosmopolitan\\" magazine), and later discovers evidence to discredit a witness in a way that only a Cosmo Girl can, with Emmett sneaking up on his blind side in the process.   Elle suffers a major setback when she discovers the real reason Callahan wanted her as an intern, but Professor Stromwell(Holland Taylor) goads Elle into having a bit more backbone and stick-to-itiveness.   Brooke fires Callahan, and hires Elle, who under Emmett's supervision, solves the case, much to her own amazement and everyone else's.   Warner, whose true character has been revealed throughout the film in subtle and not-so-subtle ways, finally views Elle as a worthy marriage partner, but Elle has her own ideas about their future relationship.   A glittering musical score accompanies our heroine as she walks out of the courtroom and into a very bright future, with a meaningful career and a wonderful life partner just on the horizon.
0805053883|4.0|My 18 month old daughter enjoys this book.  We have fun looking at all the different zoo animals.  The one thing that I don't like is the last page.  I wish that it had pictures of the animals instead of children dressed up as animals.  When my daughter is older she will like that.
0156027321|4.0|Does that title intrigue you?  It's not my idea; it's, ultimately, the theme of this book with many themes, so try to be open to it if you decide to read the book.       With its Booker prize and rave reviews, Life of Pi was on my \\"to read\\" list for a few years before I finally got around to it.  I'll assume you know the plot from other reviews, and I'll note that I agree with other reviewers who cite the first section of the book, before Pi is stuck on the lifeboat, as relatively slow and pedantic.  Once he is on the lifeboat, though, Martel's superb writing and storytelling skills get freer reign and the book starts to flow, and he does make ample use of the \\"work\\" you do in the first section with religion and zoology.         Martel has written that he spent six months in India gathering \\"local colour and detail\\" and then a year and a half reading \\"the foundational texts of Christianity, Islam and Hinduism [and] . . . books on zoo biology and animal psychology [and] . . . castaway and other disaster stories.\\"  Well it shows, in both good ways and bad.  The book is replete with interesting detail on each of those researched subjects (the good) but Martel is not always skillful in weaving his research into his story telling:  the seams often show.       Nonetheless, the story---once we reach the lifeboat---is told with such beauty and reflection (flavored with just enough humor and suspense)that it all goes down easily.  The story is not told in strictly chronological order, but rather on one topic or another---the battle between the animals; the times of deprivation; the times of plenty; the Frenchman---each with its own allegories and philosophical musings.  While some weren't my favorites (particularly the Frenchman episode, which Martel aptly described elsewhere as \\"Beckett in the Pacific\\" and named it as one of his favorite parts)on balance I found them sufficiently satisfying.    In toto, the book is warm, thought-provoking and enjoyable to go through.  Aslightly exotic cup of hot chocolate.      A little aid to literal minded readers (like me):    Hyena=cowardliness  Orangutan=maternal instincts  Zebra=exoticism       Believe it or not, Martel says he was going to have an elephant on the lifeboat, then switched to a rhinoceros, before settling on the Tiger.  Fascinating, because those books would have been so different. . .

B000G6BJS0|5.0|This set is a true bargain.  The performances are uniformly excellent, as is the recorded sound.  The liner notes are informative and well-written.  What I particularly like about this set is the variety of orchestras recorded.  It's amazing to hear the St. Petersburg orchestra do the Leningrad symphony, with appropriately pungent woodwinds and brass throughout, then switch to the more \\"mainstream\\" 10th done with the super-slick Philly orchestra, etc.  Jansons makes excellent cases for the lesser-known works, with sharply defined rhythms and consistently excellent balance throughout all works.  The works with chorus or solo voices work extremely well.  I wish EMI would have included all of Jansons' couplings (the piano concertos w/ Rudy, cello concertos w/ Mork, etc.) to give a truly unprecedented Shostakovich set, but that's a very minor complaint.  The price is right here - don't miss this set.

1594489505|5.0|In \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\", Khaled Hosseini has written a worthy, perhaps superior, followup to his debut phenomenon [[ASIN:1594480001 The Kite Runner]].  The story of all Afghan women is lovingly told from the perspectives of two: Mariam, the illegitimate daughter of a wealthy theater owner in a small Afghan city, and Laila, a 14-year old girl who enters Mariam's life via tragic circumstances.  Hosseini takes the story through the many forms of rule that have held forth in Afghanistan over the last 40 years, creating a combination of personal history and cultural history, and showing how events triggered in far-off places (both physically and emotionally) can wreak havoc on individual lives. Attitudes by Afghani men about women, held in whatever political climate, also wreak havoc on women and children.  Men come off pretty badly in the book as husbands and fathers, with one exception.  Having been prepared by \\"The Kite Runner\\", I wasn't quite as surprised by the events of this book, but I was no less touched by them.  Very highly recommended for all readers.
B00005JPHT|5.0|We saw this film on Friday and it is outstanding.  It is funny, we cried, it is real and accurate (the posts who say it isn't are just in denial - can't deal with the reality of that much pain).  I came away with a headache and feeling nauseous and then had a good cry because it put into perspective my own experience with our healthcare system and brought home to me how unbelievably insane it is.  After very difficult experiences (and I, too, had insurance), I wound up having spent my retirement savings and in terrible debt.  I had to take out a mortgage on my home which had been paid for (thank God!  otherwise I probably would have lost my home).  Now I don't know how I will ever retire.  I'm broke but I'm healthy now because I fought back.  The film brought all this home to me about how wrong it truly is.  If I lived in Canada, or Britain, or France, my house would still be paid for because I wouldn't have incurred such terrible debt and I would still be able to retire on my savings.  Michael Moore just clarified for me how terribly wrong it is that I - a taxpayer in the richest country in the world - was put in this position by politicians and healthcare insurers who are in cahoots with each other.<br /><br />Thank you, Michael Moore.  I will be going to see my representative (who's very conservative) and ask him what he is going to do about this.  Your film has empowered me to continue to fight back.  Thank you.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|An astonishingly unconventional plot brings audiences to the streets of Paris where an anthropomorphic rat aids a floundering chef in cooking superlative cuisines in Pixar's Ratatouille. Thanks to director Brad Bird and his masterful direction, we're sucked into this exquisite story. With breathtaking animation as only Pixar can provide, nonstop comedy, James Bond-esque chase sequences, and wildly caricatured characters, Ratatouille is easily one of the best films of the summer.<br /><br />Remy the rat (Patton Oswalt) has an unusually refined sense of smell and taste and quickly aspires to eat only the finest foods as opposed to rifling through garbage and stealing food like his family regularly does. His father warns him of the dangers of humans (they are dangerous to rats as well as merfolk) but during a rapid escape from their compromised home, Remy is separated and lost down the unforgiving tunnels of a sewer. When he finally clamors to the top, guided by his role model's ghostlike guiding spirit (the late, great Chef Gusteau) he realizes he's in Paris and right next to Gusteau's five-star restaurant. Determined to live his dreams of becoming a chef, he saves a recently hired, bumbling garbage boy named Linguini (Lou Romano) from disaster and embarrassment, and forms an unlikely partnership. Remy puppeteers Linguini (while hiding under his toque) making him appear to be a talented chef. Linguini's suspicious and conniving boss Skinner (Ian Holm) and the specter-like food critic Anton Ego (Peter O'Toole) are the only two who stand in their way of living their dreams and proving to themselves and their families how the most unusual circumstances can lead to success - and that anyone can cook.<br /><br />A classic example of Pixar's signature ability to select the most inspiringly unique stories as well as to throw conventionality out the window, Ratatouille makes use of extreme contrasts in its principal ideas. A rat, typically despised - especially in the kitchen - unites with a human to live out his dreams as a chef. The plausibility of this contrary scheme is low, but with the amazing character development we're sucked into the fictitious world that is so vividly painted onscreen. On an unrelated note, Pixar once again tacks on an animated short film to the beginning of the feature, this time a science fiction piece entitled \\"Lifted\\", which beautifully sets up the mood for Ratatouille's stellar story.<br /><br />Several noteworthy contrasts and singular ideas surface consistently throughout Ratatouille. Similar to Toy Story, in which the toys don't allow humans to notice their anthropomorphic qualities, the rats in Ratatouille keep their actions out of sight. They squeak when they talk (from human perspective), yet they ride boats during an escape, and Remy can read books. Are they unable to achieve human characteristics when humans aren't present? Technical contrasts exist in the editing and cinematography, including humorous transitions from Colette's face to that of Ego's malicious grimace, and rapid night-to-day cuts. Often overlooked and yet perhaps the most stunning aspect of the film is the way the camera moves: dollies, pans, and chases that carefully follow movements perfectly mimic the way a camera is used in live action, yet there are no real cameras at all. This perfect mimicry of actual cameras allows the viewer to follow the events of the CG characters exactly as if they were real, which of course adds to the precision and naturalism.<br /><br />All of the visual aspects of the film are absolutely praiseworthy. The photorealism of textures and environments continue to be near perfection and, in typical Disney fashion, the lead characters are crafted as caricatures and have exaggerated cartoon qualities. Gusteau, Linguini, Colette and the rest of the kitchen staff are all creatively skewed from standard human dimensions and proportions, while the inanimate object all remain realistically fashioned. But this familiar contrast in animated films helps emphasize the nonstop comedy and cheerful tone that permeates every scene. And most often the comical scenes involve a frantic, fast-paced chase through sea, land and air, much like James Bond's notorious opening sequence stunts. Director Brad Bird's tight direction keeps the action as intense and unpredictable as the jokes are funny.<br /><br />Full of wonderfully inventive ideas, from placing a rat in the kitchen, using Gusteau's spirit as a guide (who regularly admits to being a mere figment of Remy's imagination), to the wonderfully caricatured cast, Pixar has itself another winner. Despite the unexplained language barriers and farfetched plot, this delightfully delicious film doesn't ever become too preachy or too immature and always maintains a high level of pure entertainment.<br /><br />- Mike Massielms helps emphasize the nonstop comedy and cheerful tone that permeates every scene.

B000QUCNP4|4.0|In a dumbed-down film market where facts, context, background, details, personnel and personalities, and tedious albeit crucial connections and indicators are to be avoided at all costs as box office poison, I was very pleasantly surprised by this film's depth, in all of these aspects.  If you're a stickler for details, and if you ask questions, this film will work for you, as it did for me.  That being said, by the time the end titles rolled at two hours, 37 minutes, I was numb from the incessant cascade of leads and evidence and trails and personalities, and the genuinely palpable tension created by the characters and story, relieved it was done.<br /><br />\\"Cast\\" is a wide-ranging concept here.  Gyllenhall and the top-billed are ever-present, as are many others, but the ensemble cast continues to grow, with important characters fading out as the story rolls on and others introduced as close as ten minutes from the end of the film.  This depth of cast is required to tell this story right, and I actually felt complimented as a viewer that they've made the decision to do this, confident in my ability to sort them, remember them, and see their place in the narrative.  As noted by others, it was great to see Anthony Edwards (Goose!) in a role he filled outstandingly.  I also loved Brian Cox's Melvin Belli portrayal, which for some reason just continued to remind me of Brando.<br /><br />The period attention to detail was absolutely superb, right down to the IBM Selectrics on the desks, and an airline flight announcement that smoking was only allowed in the last six rows.  I really loved the time-lapse sequence of the building of the Trans-America pyramid, and all of the mid-70s memories that this evoked.  The vehicles were spot-on, as was the costuming (Chloe Sevigny in her first appearance with that straight blond hair and glasses looking just like Marsha Brady), expertly complementing the obviously meticulous work that went into creating the different periods of time in which this story takes place.<br /><br />Overall, the story is about the trail of the killer, and how such a complex case with a huge depth of evidence ultimately has produced no true suspect, no arrest, and no conviction.  It's about competing jurisdictions, bureaucratic obstacles, lack of communication, personalities in conflict, the relationship between law enforcement, the press, and the judicial, and it's about how small things can be extremely meaningful . . . or maddeningly irrelevant.  In the end, a serial murderer remains at large.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the direct connection made to the 1971 classic, \\"Dirty Harry,\\" it's \\"Scorpio\\" bad guy openly based on the Zodiac killer.  But, as noted so well in the film, although a few suspects--and very, very suspicious guys they are--are identified, real life is not nearly as simple and straightforward as a .44 Magnum execution.<br /><br />The film gets its \\"R\\" rating for language and violence.  The foul language is not over the top (not \\"Goodfellas\\"), and is directly relevant to the film.  The violence is rather scant, but it is very, very intense.  I say this as a longtime filmgoer who considers himself jaded in terms of cinematic portrayal of violence.  The opening scene recreates one of the early murders, and it is stark, graphic and highly unpleasant.  The lakeside murder scene is more so, extremely intense, and made me physically uncomfortable.  There are a couple of other \\"killer\\" scenes, but they are not nearly as difficult to watch as these first two.  I found myself wondering about the inclusion and meaning of this level of directly personal and highly emotional violence: I believe it is the content and conduct of these murders, the premeditation and brutality that after all drive the main characters.  This is the very reason for the story, and the viewer needs to remember these scenes as the motivators for the characters as the film moves on.<br /><br />To conclude, I thank the production team who did this film for providing me with the depth of cast, narrative, and story to let me participate in the hunt for the killer as well.  In this film I've been invited to an intellectual endeavor, and I found I enjoyed it.  I got (most of) the facts, and I can come to my own conclusions, and for that and the other reasons I list above, I heartily recommend this film.epth of cast, narrative, and story to let me participate in the hunt for the killer as well.

B00006IU73|5.0|There's not too much to say about this album that hasn't already been said, so I'll try to be short and to the point.  Simply put, In Absentia marks Porcupine Tree's transition from a mellow psychedelic band to a more alternative progressive rock band; but it is so much more than that.  I do not like using labels, especially for bands such as Porcupine Tree, where the label will surely not give them justice.  Even though In Absentia isn't as ambient as their previous work, fans of ambient music will surely find something they like on In Absentia, just as fans of good hard rock and progressive music will be impressed.  To give you an idea, I was introduced to this band through the band Opeth which is a progressive death metal band.    The songwriting is just bliss.  From the (somewhat) all encompassing \\"Blackest Eyes\\" to the minimalistic \\"Collapse the Light Into Earth,\\" there are so many great tracks, you will find yourself listening to the whole album through almost by force.  This doesn't mean you will not have favorites though, and one of those favorites will be \\"Trains\\" which is now officially Porcupine Tree's encore song.  The song just gives the listener the feeling of being at ease which is ironic considering the dark lyrical matter.  Another one of my favorites is \\"The Sound of Muzak,\\" it's just such an addictive little tune with an especially groovy drum beat.  The instrumental \\"Wedding Nails\\" has incredibly catchy riffing throughout, which builds up to an abstract solo section that is an unexpected pleasure.  Every song is beautiful though, and recorded so brilliantly.       Either way you cut it, Porcupine Tree's evolution can only convince people of just how incredible they are.  I feel obligated to let everybody know about just how great this band is!
0807126063|5.0|This is an incredibly funny book that will pull you out of your clinical depression or whatever miserable state you might be in.  I read it a few years ago when I was going through a lot of employment crap (\\"My Calvin Seminary Story\\") and it was better than a boat load of anti-depressants.  Ignatius Riley is the most lovable and utterly unpleasant character you'll ever meet, and the lesser characters of the book are equally so.  Buy it or borrow it, but don't go on in life without reading the book.

0553260111|2.0|Look, I know this review is going to anger Ludlum fans.  I'm sort of one too -- I really liked the two Matt Damon movies and am looking forward to the third.  I even liked the late 80's version done by Richard Chamberlain.  When I was in college, I couldn't put \\"The Holcroft Covenant\\" down (although I really don't know if I'd like it now).  But I found \\"The Bourne Identity\\" convoluted, absurd and just plain boring.      Italics: Cain is for Charlie! Delta is for Cain! Delta is for Charlie! Cain is for Carlos! Medusa!  Treadstone!  STOP IT!!!     What does it all mean?  I don't know and I don't care.  What I do know is that everyone around Jason is kind of like Lois Lane -- he puts on his tortoise shell glasses and he might as well be wearing a disguise that took hours to create by a professional make-up artist.  I also know that the most sophisticated super secret CIA hideout -- located in a Manhattan upper east brownstone  -- doesn't seen to contain any surveillance cameras.  And the most dangerous terrorist in the world gets in there rather easily by posing as a moving man.  For someone who's lived through Hell and can disable a man fifty ways in two seconds flat, Jason sure seems kind of whiny and uncertain, although, to be sure, he's an amnesiac (the character Matt Damon played was much more believable).    I understand that any thriller written more than a decade ago is not going to have cell phones, but I found it tedious that people couldn't contact each other.  I wish someone could explain to me what exactly the clothing boutique store had to do with the plot.  At one crucial point, Ludlum basically cuts and pastes an old French general (and his whore wife!!!) into the story, which I think was to make some sort of political point, but I'm not sure what.    \\"The Bourne Identity\\" didn't work for me at all.  I actually bought the trilogy, but it's highly unlikely that I'll be reading the next two unless I get really bored and have nothing else to read.  Even then, I can just rent the two (and soon to be three) Damon movies.

B000P2A24W|3.0|The Lost Highway should have stayed lost.  The CD for Bon Jovi fans is extremely disappointing but will please lite rock fans.  As a Bon Jovi fan from their first album to their last, I could only get through the CD once.  A waste of money and my time.  A good album for what it is but it is not the Bon Jovi I love.

B00005RYL2|5.0|1986's \\"Highlander\\" is a good science fiction movie with an exceptionally intriguing concept for a storyline, that a race of immortals live among us and are battling to the last man for an unnamed prize. The concept fueled three big screen sequels and at least two TV series. This is the movie that started it all.<br /><br />The movie proceeds along parallel story arcs. In one, an antique dealer named Nash, played by Christopher Lambert, battles a series of immortal opponents in modern day New York, while attracting the attention of a curious female police scientist named Brenda (played by Roxanne Hart).<br /><br />In the second story arc, a Scots Highlander named Connor MacLeod (also played by Lambert) who, after being badly wounded in battle in 1536, discovers that he is immortal. Connor is sought out by an even older immortal named Ramirez (perfectly played by Sean Connery) who teaches him how to fight and how to avoid losing his head to another immortal. Ramirez prepares Connor for the necessarily lonely life he will have, outliving the mortal humans around him. Ramirez also prepares him for an eventual rematch with Kurgan, the evil seven-foot giant immortal who first wounded Connor in battle.<br /><br />The two story arcs will come together in New York City in the present. Nash, as Connor now calls himself, finds himself falling in love with Brenda just as his old nemesis Kurgan arrives for \\"the Gathering\\", the final battle of immortals. Connor and Kurgan (played with snarling over-the-top menace by Clancy Brown) will maneuver for a final confrontation that only one of them can survive.<br /><br />\\"Highlander\\" was strapped by a small budget that limited production values and special effects, but the producers more than made up for this with beautiful location shooting in Western Scotland and New York City, a magnificent score by QUEEN, and some well-staged action sequences. The interaction between Macleod and Ramirez is priceless, as Ramirez imparts both fighting skill and friendship to the young Macleod.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as an exceptionally entertaining experience to science fiction fans and to fans of the later versions of this storyline.g skill and friendship to the young Macleod.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended as an exceptionally entertaining experience to science fiction fans and to fans of the later versions of this storyline.
B000OCXM68|5.0|Thank you, Mr Buble, for this fresh new cd of great material!  Your take on \\"Me and Mrs Jones\\" is now one of my top favorites!  Cannot wait to see you on stage again!
B000002UAU|5.0|I can't decribe how much I love this album. I strongly believe that this is the groups best album and the best album that's ever been released. It's meant to be a studio album and not played live cause the guys were just so sick of touring, and it just was the only way with this new direction they were going in.     Paul came up with the concept after hearing about Elvis' Car went \\"On Tour.\\" He thought that Sgt.Pepper would be an interesting concept to have these alter egos, so the music \\"wouldn't be songs that they necessarily wrote, but Sgt.Pepper did.\\" The opening track \\"Sgt.Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\" the Reprise are really the only songs that directly match up with the concept, but the songs inbetween are just as close to perfect as one could get them to be.     With a little help from my Friends is great, but I personally like Joe Cocker's version better (the one from the Wonder Years.     Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds was written after a drawing Julian lennon did and commonly thought of to be a drug song. It's one of my favorite Lennon songs. I love the intro with Paul's Bass, it's so simple but it just hits my ear drums the right way.     Getting Better is about the time when John was really falling for Yoko.   I love George's guitar in Fixing a Hole. It sounds a lot like (Ticket to Ride)    She's Leaving Home is a sad song that's got McCartney written all over it.   The following track has that weird surreal circus sound that's very fitting for the album. George Martin was great at helping the group come up with new sounds.    Within You Without You often goes unnoticed i think. It's a great song by George, that I think is great, the sound, the lyrics, etc.     Lovely Rita and When I'm Sixty four are nice little tunes but not very fitting i don't think, I would have liked to have seen Strawberry Fields be on this album cause it was the first track recorded during the sessions and because it's a great lennon song.     I like the randomness of Good Morning Good Morning. The title comes from a Corn Flakes commerical that John overheard when he was writting one day.      A Day in the Life is right after the reprise. I love how John and Pau tied in their separate parts with a great orchestral crescendo. Everything just goes together and it just works.    Definitely pick this album up if you haven't or download it or check it out at your library cause it's a must have for any music fan or art fan cause this is such an important album in music history and it changed music forever, no joke.
B000N6TX1I|1.0|Bleak, weak story line..everyone is always running. very confusing and depressing and I thought it made NO sense even though I understood what was trying to be said. The ending was a joke. Don't waste your money or time! I didn't even want to give it one star! One of the worse movies I ever saw!
B000002UAR|5.0|Revolver was released after Rubber Soul. This album continues the evolution of writting and composing of the fab four. It sounds very similar to Rubber Soul and is another great album.     Overall it's a lot more \\"60s\\" in the sound. A lot more of Georges Indian influence in the music. A lot more randomness in the writting of Lennon/McCartney. A lot more great drumming by Ringo (He's great on Tomorrow Never Knows).     Taxman is a classic song by George. It's sounds very similar to Drive My Car and just has a nice groove to it.     Paul says he made up a lot of \\"characters\\" in his songs like Eleanor Rigby. The String section was first used in Yestarday and is a perfect opening to Eleanor.     Other notable tracks are Goodday Sunshine, She Said She Said, and Tomorrow Never Knows. This is a great track written by John. He didn't want to come off the wrong way in his presentation so he used a saying Ringo came up with in \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\" This was a huge step in moving forward in the music. It showed the audience a sneek peak as to what future music would sound like and I think it's a perfect song to end with to transition into the Genius of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
B000PY52EU|4.0|Craig Brewer (Hustle and Flow) directs his second mainstream film and John Singleton produces.  Black Snake Moan stars Samuel L. Jackson as Lazarus, a religious man living in a small southern town.  Lazarus is also a blues musician. His demons are that his wife left him for his own brother and for this he is riddled with anger.  Christina Ricci plays Rae, who is an overly promiscuous girl who is traumatized by a history of child sexual abuse.  On top of that her boyfriend Ronnie has left to join the National Guard.  Ronnie is played by Justin Timberlake.  After Ronnie leaves, Rae ends up having a pretty bad evening that leaves her scantily clad and beat up in the middle of a dirt road.  She is left on a road just in front of Lazarus's house.  After helping her get better, he soon comes to find out who Rae is and what kind of reputation she has.  Lazarus sees this as a sign from god that he must heal her of her wickedness in order to receive some redemption for himself.  So he ties her up to a giant 40 pound chain.<br /><br />The film has a great atmosphere.  It comes off as sticky and sweaty throughout and plays with that imagery as the characters develop.  It consistently offers references to blues music and the characters are loud and full of life.  It comes off as exploitative in some ways but that is ultimately done for a greater cause. Samuel L. Jackson is always good, even in really bad movies, but this is one of his best roles in many years.  The real star here though is Christina Ricci who I've always felt is doing whatever she wants for now but one day she will be hailed as one of the best actresses around after a performance that hits the mainstream just right. Unfortunately for her though Black Snake Moan has not yet been a commercial success.  None of that really matters though because it is still a very good movie although both Jackson and Ricci are even better than the screenplay and direction demand.<br /><br />Some people say the film is hypocritical for sexualizing Rae and offering several erotic scenes with her, while at the same time presenting a negative view of sexuality.  Firstly, I disagree that the film portrays sexuality as a negative but instead portrays excess as a negative.  I did not feel hammered down by any messages that sex is wrong.  Secondly, Black Snake Moan is definitely not meant to be erotic.  It certainly rings of exploitation films but by watching Rae's transformation away from nymphomania and toward stabilization, away from her history of abuse to some degree of resolution, away from vulnerable to honest and confident, and away from being naked to being clothed; I can't help but think this is a fiercely unsexy film that is against hypersexuality alone.  To be pro-spirituality and critical of actions often perceived as sinful is not puritanical and not even necessarily anti-sex.  I would even argue that this movie uses religion only as a tool, but healing in general as its primary message despite the powerful Christian overtones.  No matter how you look at it Black Snake Moan is, above all, a film that reinforces morality.  It also happens to be quite entertaining.zing Rae and offering several erotic scenes with her, while at the same time presenting a negative view of sexuality.

B000002UAO|5.0|Rubber Soul was very different in the approach and sound of the previous albums. Meet the Beatles, Please Please Me, etc were all good albums but for the most part it was just bubble gum music that teen girls ate up.     During the time of Rubber Soul, the guys were getting into differnt styles of music from their own. Bob Dylan was a huge influence on every artist after him, his writting influenced a new direction for John and Paul. Also like everyone else drugs creeped into play.     Drive My Car is a good opening track that is a good transition into this new sounding album. It's what kids in the suburbs expected. Norwegian Wood is basically the same thing as Bob Dylan's 4th Time Around with a sitar.     The other Songs like Nowhere Man are kind of surreal in the lyrics and singing of the three. John and Paul had similar songs in Michelle and Girl. Michelle has that smooth sound that's his bread and butter, and Girl is basically Johns version of the same song (in my opinion).     John always took more chances in his writting than Paul. Paul was a lot more commercial and was hesitant to do anything drastic. In My Life is my favorite track on the album and I think it's one of the best out of their whole catalog.     George and Ringo also have their time to shine. In Previous songs, Rino could only play the back beat cause if he tried anything else you couldn't hear it over the screaming girls. This new direction really gave him more freedom to fill the empty space of the songs. And George is always spot on with his playing. I love how he just seemed to stay true to himself after all the mania.    I look at Rubber Soul, Revolver, and Sgt. Pepper as almost like a trilogy. All three just have nice transitions that you can some how tell that that's the order they were released in. The maturaty in the lyrics, the new sounds incorporating new instruments and musicians.     Back to Rubber Soul... Overall it's one of my favorite albums of all time. It's definitely an albumeveryone should listen to. The songs are timeless and it sounds like nothing else. I love how the songs never go out of \\"style\\" I don't really believe one can slap a date on the music because it's revelant even today. There's always new generations discovering this music continuing the legacy of the Four Working Class Lads from Liverpool.
B000JVT1U0|5.0|The Wicker Man is a film about a pious Christian sergeant's visit to a small island off the coast of Scotland called the Island of Summerisle.  His name is Neil and he is there to investigate the disappearance of a girl.  His investigation reveals that the island is enamored with a neo-pagan religion.  They worship the sun instead of Jesus.  They engage in pagan fertility rituals instead of Neil's proud pre-marital chastity.  They believe in reincarnation where the Christian canon Neil is devoted to does not.  As if the islanders are telepathically connected, Neil receives absolutely no help from anyone in his investigation.  He gradually puts together more and more details about the inhabitants' practices and is suspicious of everyone.<br /><br />A May Day festival approaches and Neil becomes concerned that the girl who is missing may indeed be the latest sacrifice to appease nature.  But as the Island owner Lord Summerisle reveals, Neil too is a virgin and is both wise and foolish.  He comes as a king representing Her Majesty's government.  He also arrives to a place of sacrifice by his own free will.  The final sequence of the Wicker Man is the ultimate warning toward blind faith.  Anyone who misses the point here, like the makers of the 2006 remake of the Wicker Man did, will clearly find little resolution in the end but others willing to enjoy and exercise their imagination a little bit will have much to mull over.<br /><br />The film's music is one of its strengths and the detail of the pagan references and how they are convenient roots to many Christian traditions (i.e. Easter icons and Beltane or May Day) help to make the overall vision of the Wicker Man even more compelling.  All of the elements within the film melt together and everyone working it must've understood these ideas in perspective.<br /><br />The funny thing about the Wicker Man is it is often referred to as a Horror film.  There really isn't anything else to call it but it is almost too unique and exceptional to be deemed a horror film. It isn't scary like a typical horror film is.  It doesn't elicit fear and disgust the way all other horror films have.  There are no zombies, vampires or murdering sociopaths.  There are no supernatural forces and there is little blood to be spilled.  It isn't characterized by that one note creepy music or menacing Hitchcockian suspense.  It doesn't rely on knives and masked killers stalking in the night.  It doesn't even need a seemingly indestructible villain.  The Wicker Man is a film that relies exclusively on its all encompassing atmosphere and it also relies on our own understandings of religion and faith.  It is sunny, it is bright, it is cheerful, but for all of the wrong reasons to many of us.  It is compelling all throughout.  Somehow on this island paganism resurfaced and the worshippers are fiercely and irrationally devout.  That point's layers of commentary aside, the Wicker Man is very much a horror film and it is probably more intelligent than any other movies within its genre.o be deemed a horror film.

6305041156|5.0|RAN, directed by Akira Kurosawa in 1985 at the age of seventy-five, is truly an amazing and soaring film masterpiece.  The gorgeous cinematography looked like it was lifted directly out of 16th century Japanese screens.  What's more, the numerous instances of violence, interspersed with fabulously well-acted scenes, are so beautiful, stylistically, they look more like seamlessly choreographed [and very violent] dance interludes.  The colors (reds, yellows, blues) all glow as if from another world.<br /><br />RAN (English translation:  WRETCHEDNESS)  is a Japanese version of Shakespeare's KING LEAR, and Kurosawa brilliantly interweaves the original plot [of family inheritance and betrayal] with his own examination of family loyalty and deception.  The Great Lord Hidetora (Tatsuya Nakadai), ascending into his declining years, decides to divide his kingdom into three parts, between his three sons, Taro (Akira Terao), Jiro (Jinpachi Nezu), and Saburo (Daisuke Ryu).  While the two older heirs, Taro and Jiro, proceed to bestow false praise on him, only to deceive him later, his youngest, Saburo, warns him, early in the story, of the grim reality of human deception [particularly the deception that his brothers are luring his father with].  In anger, Hidetora throws Saburo out of the kingdom for being insolent and disrespectful.  Unfortunately, the young man's observations ring true when his brothers attempt to completely drive their father out of the kingdom and assert total domination of his estate.  This drives their elderly father into complete insanity.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is a very tragic story, but it is beautifully told in such a way that you are left with a great appreciation of the majesty of the beautiful aesthetics, the great acting, and even moments of great, unbridled humor.  Particularly, Hidetora's fool, Kyoami (Shiinnosuke \\"Peter\\" Ikehata) breaks the tensions of this tragic tale with little songs and dances [before the real violence erupts, of course, and then he is running for his life along with Hidetora and Saburo].  This film has been compared with SEVEN SAMURAI as one of Kurosawa's best works of all time.  I would agree that it is one of the best ones.  Both films are exemplary for different reasons.  While RAN utilized color, light and dramatic intensity in depicting this violent portrait of the downfall of a royal family, SEVEN SAMURAI masterfully showcased cutting edge camera tricks, shadow and light [to give the ILLUSION that it was shot in color], as well as wonderful acting.<br /><br />As a final note, this wonderful film which was the recipient of many film awards (including an Academy Award for Best Foreign Film) is rated R for a very good reason.  As I said before, it is very violent and bloody (this includes a decapitation, scenes of combat with bows and arrows sticking out of people's backs, eyes, legs and other appendages, and gunfire) and there is a scene of suggested sex.  Nevertheless, the scenes of numerous fatal battle scenes are filmed so beautifully that they truly are in a class by themselves.  A gorgeous soundtrack envelops the sounds of excessive bloodshed, early on, and it is almost hypnotic to watch.  Don't miss out on this amazing work of cinematic art.he is running for his life along with Hidetora and Saburo].

B000R8YC1I|5.0|This movie is Jim Henson's magnum opus. There isn't a fantasy movie out there that brings you to a whole different reality like The Dark Crystal does. The only movie that comes close is James Cameron's Avatar. Yes the movie is all performed entirely by puppets and yes there isn't a human being in site. That's the beauty of it. With a combination of an excellent story, innovative (for its time) animatronics, beautiful sets and cinematography you get a truly dazzling experience that any fantasy fan would be a fool not to miss.     The biggest aspect of Dark Crystal is the setting. They created a whole different world with its own animals, plants and terrain. The level of detail put into creating this new world is staggering and you get some good scenes to soak yourself up in it. From the rock caves of the Mystics to the jagged spires of the Skesis castle to Aughra's planetarium to every landscape in between. You will get drawn into this alien world. The beauty of the sets and location shots is only enhanced with some fantastic cinematography and conventional effects.     Since we are essentially talking about a puppet show brought to you as a feature film let's talk about the puppets. Granted they might seem a bit archaic by today's standards, they were nothing short of incredible back in 1982. To have puppets act and react in such an organic and lifelike fashion was never done on film before. This is the first movie where you get that sort of eye and mouth movements we have come so used to with current animatronics. Famed artist Brian Froud created all of the creatures and characters for Dark Crystal and if you're a fan of his work you will definitely see it. When you look at the majesty of the Mystics you forget they are just people covered in foam latex.     Of course having a truly creative setting and truly creative characters would not be enough to make a great movie. Lord knows fantasy fans have seen plenty of examples that prove that point. However this moviehas a story that is as classic as any fable you have read before. By the time you finish this movie if will feel like you just read a grand fairy tale... only about wondrous and fantastic creatures never seen before. It's not deep storytelling. Then again it shouldn't be considering the mythical theme.     The soundtrack for this film is a perfect fit for the movie. The main themes are grand, dynamic and best of all memorable with a full orchestra giving the music vibrant life. Other pieces of the film work with what I can best describe as old western European instrumentation and themes, and again they work wonderfully. I can think of about a half dozen songs from the movie right now that would stick in my head in a good way if I let it. The music is that memorable. Okay... I do remember one song in the least useful scene (Skeksis banquet) in the movie that didn't impress me. But to be honest the music was fitting the scene, and the scene didn't impress me either.     The original release of this DVD had a host of wonderful extras that made it feel like the only DVD you would ever need. Then came the 25th Anniversary Edition, which gave an impressive upgrade to the visuals (I mean night and day difference) via a digital remaster, Dolby Digital Surround sound, a new commentary and some additional features. On a small note they took out the Spanish stereo track the original DVD had and included a surround track in Japanese.     Now we have the Blu-Ray. Even if you bought any of the previous releases (and all of them were worthy purchases at the time) you definitely want to make that double/triple dip. And I thought the Anniversary Edition was an amazing improvement. The details really, really stand out on the Blu-Ray. I see little details as plain as day that I never noticed before. It even gives new life to the aging puppets by bringing out even the subtlest of details. The sound is very much improved with Dolby TruHD in English, French and Portugese. A Dolby Digitalsurround Spanish track is finally included. Looks like they corrected the absence of the Spanish track on the Anniversary Edition, and then some. But then they take out the Japanese audio track. What's going on here? There are a few new extras on the Blu-Ray, but nothing that compares to the previous features. Here is a run down:    COMMENTARY BY BRIAN FROUD - Brian is the conceptual designer for the movie and essentially created the world for Jim Henson. He goes on about design techniques and how he came about the characters and inspirations for his work in The Dark Crystal.     WORLD OF THE DARK CRYSTAL - The most amazing \\"making of\\" documentary one can ever ask for. It details over an hour of footage regarding conceptual design, character creation, production, cinematography, the philosophy behind the creation of this movie and the world it is based on, and more. This documentary was made while the Dark Crystal was released so you get interviews with the man himself, Jim Henson, at the time of the movie along with scores of others involved in the movie. Most \\"making of\\" documentaries that come out with movies these days are little more than lip service to help promote the movie. I wish they would follow the model done on THIS documentary.     REFLECTIONS OF THE DARK CRYSTAL - Two-part featurette (Shard of Illusion [16 minutes] and Light on the Path of Creation [20 minutes]) with more recent interviews from writers, directors, and performers including co-writer David O'Dell, conceptual designer Brian Froud, and Jim Henson's son Brian. These featurettes also include newly discovered test footage from Jim Henson's home in England.     PICTURE-IN-PICTURE STORYBOARD TRACK - This is probably the best Blu-Ray exclusive feature in the set. As the titles describes you get a sizable window showing pre-production storyboards and conceptual drawings, each with descriptions of what you are seeing.      THE BOOK OF THRA: THE DARK CRYSTAL COLLECTOR - Hmm... is it a game? You click a button on the remote every time you see an icon appear. Not much of a game. Is it an in-movie encyclopedia? When you collect the entries in this Blu-Ray exclusive you get notes on various characters, places, and creatures in the film. Mostly the names and duties of the Skeksis and Urru (mystics). It's neat, but it would have been less cumbersome if they just made a data file type page instead of something you have to watch the movie to see. The details are sparse, and if you want to really get into this universe you're better off getting [[ASIN:B001H55MBY The World of the Dark Crystal]]. Or better yet Wikipedia.     ORIGINAL SKEKSIS LANGUAGE: Test Scenes - The original concept of The Dark Crystal was to have many of the creatures speak their own language, which we would get subtitles for, in order to further put in that different world. I think that would have been a cool way to see the movie and with this footage you get an idea of Jim Henson's original concept. Keep in mind this is not fully produced footage  and it's not the same as seeing the end product. Namely the character Augra is being dubbed with Frank Oz's Miss Piggy-esque voice over and of course there is no music or post-production. Still it's interesting to get a taste of what the movie could have been like.     DELETED FUNERAL SCENES - Just a deleted scene of the Skeksis funeral. You're really not missing much taking it out if you ask me. The funeral itself is boring. The scene has some footwate with Jen talking to one of the Mystics about his quest, which was nice. No remastering on the scene of course. It's pretty grainy.     SKEKTEK'S CRYSTAL CHALLENGE - Also a Blu-Ray Exclusive. It's a trivia game played throughout the movie. A question pops up and you have to answer or get some of your essence drained. Not as annoying as the Book of Thra feature, but I still don't see why they don't just put this separate from the film.     Every time I have reviewed a Dark Crystal disk I have been impressed. It seems they just keep getting better and better. The first one had the movie with a good array of language tracks and extra features that still top all that has been offered since. The second one ups the ante with an amazing digital remastering. Now the Blu-Ray gives and absolutely jaw dropping visual and audio presentation that even dwarfs the visual clarity of the second release; especially for a movie that was made back in 1982. If you have a Blu-Ray player and like The Dark Crystal you owe it to yourself to get this.       I will admit that some people might be put off of this movie due to the lack of human actors in front of you and the fact the puppet animatronics might feel dated (although I feel less so with the Blu-Ray presentation). It's a shame people would feel that way because The Dark Crystal is fantasy storytelling at its finest. If you are a fan of the genre this movie is an absolute must. If you're a Muppet fan... well these aren't Muppets so don't expect Fraggle Rock when you see it. Any fan of grand storytelling who wants to be whisked away to a strange faraway land will find what they are looking for in The Dark Crystal. Do yourself a favor and check this movie out.
0385522401|3.0|It has been along time since I grew so angry with an author that I threw the book across the room, but I hurled this one.  After Amsterdam, Atonement and Saturday I had expected so much more.  I had expected real characters with flaws that I couold hate and love.  And, what do i get here, two of the most boring creations who are so conflicted about sex - yes and it's the early sixties and i ws around then too - that it appears that they are doomed in domesticity.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|I recently saw the US HD TV version of Planet Earth with Sigourney Weaver Narrating, the quality was amazing. I have a PAL PS3  that doubles as a Blu-ray player, so when I saw that Planet Earth was avaliable on Blu-ray, I had to have it. The blu-ray version is currently only avaliable in the U.S., but it is not zoned so it works fine on my PAL Playstation 3. The quality of the camera working and the high dfinition is fabulous, a must have if you have a blu-ray player and a bargain as well for over 500 minutes of 1080P quality.
B000MR9D5E|3.0|Wonderfully filmed and awe-inspiring, but marred by unscientific nutcake alarmism (\\"the icecaps are melting! it's our fault! aaargh! the penguins are dying! Aaargh!\\") - search for junkscience or see Inhofe's site for the scientific rejection of this religious ranting. Also, necessarily vague Darwinist pablum is randomly tossed in. If you can ignore this religious material and focus on the real science, you're in for a treat.
B00005JNX0|4.0|This is a good movie.  It is very funny and I have enjoyed watching this movie many times.  If you are looking for a deep movie, however, you had better look somewhere else.  This movie is very light, but not too immature I think.  Overall a good addition to any collection.

0743455967|4.0|I found this book very encouraging at a time when I was just getting serious about writing. A lot of good advice, especially the self-editing chapter.  The parts about getting published and finding an agent seemed dated to me, though; things were different when King was starting out over 30 years ago.
B000IAZPKM|5.0|This DVD does an excellent job of capturing the power and melody of a Kamelot concert. Both the audio and video quality are top notch, and Roy's voice really shines. The accompanying booklet is wonderfully designed, but lacks the lyrics for those who may not have all of Kamelot's catalog. In short, the DVD is a must-have for any Kamelot fan, and would function well to introduce the uninitiated.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|Tom does a great job on all for stories. The scenes are pleasant and calm. The crime is cold and solvable. When the legal paperwork won't solve a domestic problem, Chief Stone adds his 'extra' means of enforcement. We need more police chiefs (and patrolmen) willing take the extra means necessary to control the 'bad' element out there. If they had done so when the bad seeds were younger, perhaps they would have chosen a better path. Good writing and directing. Great story. Need more of this caliber on TV and DVD.
1596912855|2.0|I guess what is most disappointing to me is that the book is aimed at Austen lovers, yet it seems as thin as tissue paper - pretty tissue paper.  And I wanted to love it.  It's a great premise!  But then the author spends almost no time talking about the world she has created and the heroine's experience of it.  It's too sketchy and quick-paced.  It isn't true to the detailed, character-driven Austen plots.  Unless you spend time in the Austen world, and get involved in the subplots and in more than 2 characters, the supposed \\"payoff\\" of romantic resolution just isn't gratifying.     I also found the main character shallow -- she seems to overreact greatly to minor mishaps, yet has no relationship to speak of, with the other women who occupy \\"Austenland\\".  In fact, another glaring omission to me was the lack of any character development, especially among the other women.   Austen novels each contain many memorable characters, some of whom you like, others whom you dislike -- making the books very human.        It feels like someone edited out lots of material, determined perhaps to pare the book down to under 200 pages.   Why?   Does the publisher think that Austen lovers have no attention span?   When I saw the book's length, I immediately thought, how is the author going to do this?  It's too sketchy and I felt disappointed that such a great idea wasn't handled with more care.     If you're going to read it, I recommend checking it out from the library.
B00005JPHT|4.0|It's a travesty.  No, not Michael Moore's latest documentary, but the health care system.  Armed with anecdotes about horror stories coming from the uninsured, the underinsured, and a wide range of denied claimants, Moore gives us a lot of reasons to come inoculated when seeing his latest movie.<br /><br />'Sicko' is broad in scope.  Filming participants in each of the aforementioned categories, he goes through the history of universal health care's failure to be enacted in the United States.  From The Red Scare of the fifties until the sweeping campaign against Senator Clinton's proposal when she was first lady, we get some colorful and interesting presentation.  In addition to the benefits of these illuminating vignettes, we see other angles.  We hear confessions by representatives at different levels of the health insurance organizations and various health care providers.  Then we go over seas and across the border to get cross sections of three countries and how its citizens reflect and cope with their universal health care systems.<br /><br />***(SAMPLER ALERT:  IF YOU WANT TO GET THE GIST OF THE MOVIE WITHOUT A FEW EXAMPLES, THEN PLEASE READ NO FURTHER)*** This film has a plethora of testimony and personal stories, so I just want to give you a few free samples.<br /><br />DIAGNOSIS-<br />  ---An uninsured Oregon man had to choose between saving his index or ring finger after sawing both tips off.<br />  ---An older, middle-aged couple who \\"DID\\" have health insurance had to sell their home and live with their daughter.<br />  ---Some insurance applicants were denied because of the proportion of their height and weight.<br />  ---A man was denied a bone marrow transplant from a younger brother because it was called \\"Experimental\\".<br /><br />AGENTS-<br />  ---Health care insurers in league with some health care providers.

B00070Q7VO|3.0|I like Mike. He's a talented guy, but this, and the Call Me Irresponsible CD are just ok. He makes a few attempts in areas where he is not proficient, doesn't have the training, or the voice, but makes a decent go of it. However, the end result simply isn't convincing. He should stick with covers as he did in his opener, and even then, try not to make them his own by changing the musical accompaniment vastly. Good Jazz/Crooner, stick with it! Don't let the producers get in your way.

B000Q6ZMCO|3.0|You know how Oasis CD's always sound big and urgent, like something great is going to happen?  There's a lot of that here, and unfortunately nothing really does. \\"Folding Stars\\" is the best example of that, big guitars and the lead up to the multi-harmony chorus . . . that just isn't there.  \\"Dust Dances\\" is the slow burner type that sounds promising, but as the band gets into it they keep stretching lines out looking for something to click that doesn't quite happen, it all sounds like the lead up to the passage they were looking for and never found.  \\"Saturday\\" goes against their sound, it's too fast and loud, and again never quite gets to a memorable hook.<br /><br />A very frustrating CD, because I liked their sound and voices and was kind of rooting for them to really hit it.  The problem is the one thing they're missing is the most difficult of all, nothing else really matters if you can write hooks.  And if you can't, no amount of good noise makes up for it, because it just drains in one ear and out the other.  You can learn a lot about music, but you can't learn to hit the gong, you either have it or you don't.  Sorry guys.
B00007KWHP|5.0|Yes' high point, obviously, with a pair of eight-minute epics that make good use of their shifting arrangements and keep themselves just absolutely stunning through their length: \\"Roundabout\\" and \\"South Side of the Sky\\". The former was of course the big hit, mixing a classical guitar introduction, a funky clavinet-mania part, the spaced-out harmony section and the hard-rock section; \\"South Side\\" is similar but just as good, and that song's hard rock section is the heaviest I've ever heard Yes. \\"Heart of the Sunrise\\" is similar, but much longer than either of those two, and in truth could've been as good if two things happened: the introduction was cut, and the transitions between sections smoothed out a bit. There are also several short songs, mostly quite good: the keyboard-driven single \\"Long Distance Runaround\\" is, that's for sure; so is the a capella piece \\"We Have Heaven\\" and the classical guitar solo \\"Mood for a Day\\" is real pretty. A couple of the other short songs (\\"Cans and Brahms\\"; \\"Five Per Cent for Nothing\\"; \\"The Fish\\") don't add much, but they're brief, so that's forgiven. I'm not big on prog, and even I admit I like this quite a bit.
0143036556|5.0|\\"What did the Easter Islander who cut down the last palm tree say as he was doing it?\\" This question, posed by Jared Diamond's students, sounds like the set-up for a joke, but instead it frames the various theses of \\"Collapse.\\" This book complements Diamond's superb \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\" but is (I think) far more accessible to the general reader. Diamond's Easter Island question is, of course, a loaded one (there probably was no \\"last tree\\" by the end of the island's period of drastic deforestation), but it focuses our attention on the question of how societies can, Samson-like, pull down the very pillars of the castles they inhabit--both knowingly and (sometimes) unknowingly.<br /><br />Diamond examines a variety of civilizations, past and present, which have collapsed, along with a few (such as Japan and its astonishing reforestation program) that have avoided imminent environmental devastation. Deforestation is common to many of the societies Diamond studies; it's interrelated with soil run-off and salinization; river flow disruption, water pollution, and the reduction of reservoirs; overgrazing and extinction (of plants and animals); climate change and drought; and other problems. Diamond discusses these \\"technical\\" aspects of land and water management with such clarity and verve that I often found the entire book (and particularly his case studies) endlessly fascinating; it's been a long time since I've come across a book-length essay of environmental writing that was so enthralling.<br /><br />His book covers far too much to summarize here; but it has been criticized from two angles. First are those (like author Gregg Easterbrook) who find faults in extrapolating lessons from isolated societies (Greenland, Easter Island) or prehistoric civilizations (the Mayan empire, even China). Diamond anticipates these objections: \\"The whole world today is a self-contained and isolated unit.\\" This point is driven home with every fuel shortage, every epidemic (the flu of 1919 and, today, AIDS), every \\"world\\" war, every economic hiccup we face. Furthermore, prehistoric or not, many of these \\"collapsed\\" societies shared common problems (deforestation, above all, but also climate change, poverty, mass migrations, genocide) that we still have not overcome--\\"such collapses have actually been happening recently, and others appear to be imminent. Instead, the real question is how many more countries will undergo them.\\" (As Diamond also argues, those who think technology will save us are counting on panaceas that have been neither created nor imagined.)<br /><br />A second line of criticism is, to me, far more relevant. That is, given the impending disasters Diamond lines up for our consideration, his \\"cautious optimism\\" can be a little hard to share. He offers some valuable and commendable suggestions for turning the tide--but he never seriously considers the equally plausible question: \\"What if it's simply too late to fix {insert problem here}?\\" (Example: the increasing belief by many scientists that we're past the \\"point of no return\\" for stopping the ill effects of global warming.) Similarly, even if it's not too late, is it realistic that we can get those who hold the purse strings and the power to change their ways in the little time remaining to us? In other words, while Diamond addresses various fix-it solutions for the \\"cautiously optimistic,\\" he neglects to contemplate emergency plans for the resignedly pessimistic. (We have been unable to either save or rebuild New Orleans; what can we prepare to do in case the next disaster is even more devastating?)<br /><br />Consideration of both approaches--catastrophe prevention, as well as crisis management--is vital as our planet's resources dwindle and we teeter near the edge. But this qualm really applies only to the last few pages of this extraordinary work. Anyone who reads this book and comes away without a new comprehension of the dilemmas we face and an anxious concern for the direction our planet is heading is neither cautiously optimistic nor resignedly pessimistic, but purely Pollyannaish.neither cautiously optimistic nor resignedly pessimistic, but purely Pollyannaish.
B000002AH7|4.0|Hey! This ain't jazz! This is Spanish-tinged classical! With a fanfare that seems fitting to introduce matadors (not a criticism, not a compliment) on \\"Saeta\\"! Yeah, that's right. Miles' eclecticism kicks in again, I suppose. It's a bit overrated, and it's controversial even by Miles' standards. I like it though. Other than \\"Concerto de Aranjeuz\\". That song, or work, or whatever fails to move me. Now, \\"Will o' the Wisp\\", aye, that be a different cup of tea. It really is moving, emotional, haunting, and so forth; so is \\"The Pan Piper\\", with an eerie flute melody. \\"Saeta\\" starts off like those two, but ends up doing the pompous fanfare thingy, but hey, at least it does it well. And the closing \\"Solea\\" is pretty good too! It sounds almost like the Hollywood version of traditional Spanish music, the kind you'd expect to hear when the charming Spanish swordfighter is having a duel in a ballroom, but again, it gets quite intense during its climax around nine minutes in. I like intense. This is easily the best Miles/Evans album. Just to warn you, though, it's quite rigid; as usual, Miles is put on a pedestal above the other guys. I mostly prefer him in a small-group setting. I do, however, recommend Sketches of Spain in spite of that.

B00008G9JO|4.0|After Aqualung, the critics are pretty dismissive (and downright hostile) to Jethro Tull.  They only had a few hits after Aqualung (a single edit of Thick as a Brick and Bungle in the Jungle), and most of their 70's work is dismissed.  It's really BS, because their work became much more complicated and progressive as the decade wore on.  Here their restless experimentation and complicated songs really come through.  I love the opener ...and the Mouse Police Never Sleeps.  That's a great title for an opening song, something you would probably never hear today.  The song Moths is one of my all time favorite Tull songs, one which I play constantly.  The title track is very poetic and wistful, and is another favorite.  All of Tull's albums are excellent.  There was never one really bad one in the patch.  Critics have always had it in for prog rock, and when Tull went in that direction, the critics took out their long knives and started cutting away.  Despite this, Tull remained popular throughout the 70's (especially in the U.K. and Europe), and have continued to make great music.
0385522401|5.0|I have to confess up front that Ian McEwan is one of my favorite novelists.  \\"On Chesil Beach\\" further solidifies McEwan as a master of prose and the English language.  The story centers on the wedding night in 1962 of Edward and Florence -- fittingly before the sexual revolution and changing sexual mores of the later 1960s.<br /><br />From different parts of British society, McEwan takes us inside the minds of these two characters, both virgins, as they each ponder the impending consumation of their love on their wedding night.  As the night unfolds, it is more than uncomfortable reading the meticulous detail that McEwan paints of the awkward attempt of Edward and Florence to have sex.  While this scene doesn't occupy many pages, one has already sensed a classic cataclysmic moment that is the hallmark of McEwan's books.<br /><br />After that moment, the reader is left to ponder how the inevitable post -bedroom encounter between Edward and Florence will play out.  In the end, the dialogue \\"on Chesil beach\\" is perfectly constructed -- the only thing not perfect is the choice that both characters make that resonates with each of them for the rest of their lives.
0743298020|5.0|I love books. I love books about books. The Thirteenth Tale is one of these books, and Setterfield's own passion for the written word is beautifully evident. She did a speclatular job. The Thirteenth Tale teems with life while recounting stories of shattering loss. Her writing is superb; her beginnings, middles, and endings, deftly and stunningly placed; her descriptions gripping, delightfully shocking, and never too long. I was spellbound by her writing, hungry for her story, and awed by her deep knowledge of me, as a reader. All great writers are readers first. Setterfield knows every true reader's heart through and through. That is what makes her great.

B000PFUA9G|5.0|5th Gear is an excellent new CD from Brad Paisley.  Brad has always been very perceptive about life and relationships.  I like the way he turns his perceptions into songs.  \\"Online\\" is my favorite track.  This is a very funny song about how a person can have an online life and a very different real life.  \\"I'm Still A Guy\\" is another good song about how a man's personality doesn't change when he is in a relationship  There is a lot of truth in this song, and that is why I like it so much.  \\"All I Wanted Was A Car\\" is a very true song about how a car is the most important thing to a young man in high school.  \\"Some Mistakes\\" is a song about how some mistakes in life can be fun.  I like Brad's fun vocals on this track.  \\"Oh Love\\" is a very pretty duet with Carrie Underwood.  I really how their voices blend together.  \\"Letter To Me\\" is an excellent song for any person who feels depressed about being dumped.  This is a very hopeful song,  and I like it very much.  \\"Mr. Policeman\\" and \\"Throttleneck\\" are two up tempo songs that show Brad's talent on the guitar.  This is a very enjoyable new CD by Brad Paisley.
B00005JKBC|5.0|Phenomenally well done spy/suspense film which keeps you captivated the entire film as to what is going on, where the movie is going, and how all the pieces are going to fit together in the end.    You have Robert Redford, playing a veteran field operative for the CIA named Nathan Muir, whom has one last day of work for the bureau before he retires. He's tipped off by outside sources that something has gone wrong with his protoge Tom Bishop, played by Brad Pitt, whom is a another CIA field operative whom has been recruited and trained by Nathan Muir. Muir arrives at work on his last day of work to figure out what exactly is going on.    During the next 24 hours, Nathan Muir pieces together that Tom Bishop has be captured by the Chinese for espionage and will be executed within 24 hours if the USA doesn't claim him. The upper tier of management at the CIA isn't going to claim/rescue Tom Bishop. Instead, letting him be executed by the Chinese because the U.S. President is about to visit China the following week regarding future trade between the U.S. & China.... It is the CIA's take that claiming Bishop will look badly on the US and ruin any future trade with China. To make matters worse, Bishop wasn't on any official assignment to China on behalf of the CIA and the US has no idea why he has broken into a Chinese Prison.... So the real question being asked is by the CIA: Is Tom Bishop a rogue agent OR not?    Throughout the rest of the movie we see Nathan Muir using his skills as a field operative within the CIA's headquarters to find out what is going on with Tom Bishop. During this time, we find out how Nathan Muir & Tom Bishop became acquainted and the nature of their relationship, what kind of man each is, through the course of flashbacks that Muir's character relates to a group of upper management whom want to know more about Bishop's character. Muir only tells them as much as they need to know as he plans to rescue Bishop from China before the 24 hour time period once he finds out from upper management where Tom Bishop is being held.    The twists and turns throughout this movie show us how Nathan Muir rescues Tom Bishop and what/why Tom Bishop was doing in China in the first place. It is one fantastic movie that is great to watch every time!
0385340540|3.0|It's been several years since I last read a book by John Grisham. I liked THE FIRM very much. It was fast-paced and well-plotted. A fun ride. I also liked THE CLIENT. I thought the ten-year-old kid would have been more believable as a twelve- or thirteen-year-old, but overall it was pretty good. As I read more of Grisham's books, however, I became increasingly disenchanted. THE TESTAMENT was the last straw. Recently, though, I had an opportunity to pick up a used copy of THE BROKER gratis, so I decided to give it a try.<br /><br />The book begins with a lame-duck president granting a full pardon to former Washington power-broker Joel Backman at the urging of the head of the CIA. Backman has served six years of a twenty year sentence in federal prison for his involvement in trying to sell access to a secret satellite network. The CIA chief `s plan is to give Backman a new identity, then leak the information and wait to see who kills him.<br /><br />This little tale has a few tense moments, but unfortunately they are too few and not sufficiently tense. Much of the book passes with Backman wandering the streets of Italian cities, especially Bologna, ostensibly trying to learn to be believable as an Italian, but really waiting for the right moment to bolt. It's mildly engaging and I was somewhat entertained, but it certainly wasn't the intense page-turner I was expecting it to be.<br /><br />THE BROKER was, for me, a step up from my last book by this author, but it still left a lot to be desired. I'll probably read more of his stuff in the future, but probably not real soon and I'll be pretty careful about what I pick based on my experience to date. His writing can be very good, but not reliably so. I can't give this one an enthusiastic recommendation.
B000P0J024|5.0|The two original albums,released respectively in 1988 and '90 have been long out of print. This package contains all previously released albums and videos with bonus tracks which were previously unreleased. This all-star line-up consisted of Jeff Lynne,who founded and originally led The Electric Light Orchestra,the late ex-Beatle George Harrison,the late Roy Orbison,Bob Dylan and Tom Petty. Volume One was the 1988 album which opens with the hit HANDLE WITH CARE(lead vocal by Harrison and bridge by Orbison). That one is a nice country-flavored ballad. Dylan takes the lead on DIRTY WORLD,CONGRATULATIONS,MARGARITA and TWEETER AND THE MONKEY MAN. Lynne leads on RATTLED. Petty takes the lead on LAST NIGHT with Orbison again singing the bridge. Orbison's sole lead is heard on NOT ALONE ANYMORE. Harrison leads on HEADING FOR THE LIGHT. On another Top 20 hit,END OF THE LINE,only Dylan does not sing. Since this original release,Texas-born Orbison suffered a fatal heart attack on December 6,1988 at age 52. He had just completed his final all-original album MYSTERY GIRL,released in early 1989. Liverpool,England-born Harrison succumbed to lung cancer on November 29,2001 at age 58. Volume Two was the video counterpart to Volume One(the DVD contained herein). Volume Three was recorded with the ensemble downgraded to a quartet(after Orbison's passing). NOBODY'S CHILD was released only as a single in '90. Del Shannon,famous for his 1962 hit RUNAWAY,was supposed to fill the void left by Orbison's passing but Shannon himself had died by means of suicide.

0618680004|3.0|Richard Dawkins (The God Delusion) is both brilliant and very disappointing. Brilliant because of his knowledge of science, but disappointing because he did not succeed in doing what he set out to do. He did not come close to proving either that God does not exist or that he is unnecessary - as he claimed. It seems to me that what Dawkins has done is replace God with the new god of science (Darwin). He becomes almost ecstatic when he writes about Darwin (the new Messiah??).I was aslo disappointed that Dawkins only spoke favorably of those with whom he agreed - not the sign of fairness at all. Also, anyone with whom he disagreed (even fellow athiests) he labeled as \\"uneducated,\\" \\"unsophisticated,\\" \\"unenlightened by natural selection,\\" or sometimes just plain \\"stupid.\\" that tells us more about the character of the man than about his erudition. I have always felt that extremists on either end of the spectrum (liberal- or athiest, or fundamentalist Christian) suffer from the same disease - that is I am right and everyone who disagrees with me is wrong. Athiests sometimes refer to theists as obcurantist and fundamental Christians refer to athiests as infidels. Neither appelation is helpful. Dawkins defends himself from the label of fundamentalist by saying that he is not, he is only \\"passionate.\\"  The religious fundamentalist is also passionate about what he believes but he is still called a fundamentalist. I enjoyed most of the science of the book and many of the religious anecdotes, and I certainly agree that religions have acted badly over the centuries, but that does not disprove God's existence, or that God is a delusion and unnecessary. I did not enjoy Dawkins \\"Messiah Complex.\\" I am a Christian who enjoys reading well balanced books of all discriptions - including those by athiests. Unfortunately, I did not find Dawkins book well balanced or fair in many instances.
0767817478|2.0|I watched 1998's Godzilla again after nine years and the experience has gotten better with age. I remember that I was hugely disappointed when the film was released but I guess I've mellowed with time. Either that or monster movies have gotten progressively worse.    Yes, the acting is routinely bad all around, even though Matthew Broderick and Jean Reno try. They are not helped by a rather poor script but I'm willing to forvive that now. Indeed there are a few funny (albeit unintentionally) lines of dialogue that produced chuckles.     The premise is as one would expect. Big monster created by nuclear fallout. It  travels to New York in order to nest. Lots of mayhem ensues. Lots of baby zillas hatch at Madison Square Garden. There is a large amount of destruction before the good guys win. Godzilla spends about 30 minutes hunting down a cab. Monster killed. End of story. Great premise for summer blockbuster if your target audience is teenage boys. Bad premise for anyone who actually thinks about the film they have just seen. Sure its illogical but this is Godzilla not Citizen Cane.    I did not view the fairly new \\"Monster\\" Edition but the standard one disc limited edition. The film sounds great and looks quite good. It features a featurette on the making of the film and a commentary track by the Special Effects Coordinator along with some bonus publicity materials.  These special features ar ok but not great.    Like I said I've mellowed over the years. While Godzilla is not great filmaking it can be a rather fun ride. Give it a chance at least to laugh at.
B000F6IOC0|1.0|Oh, me. Instead of listening to the reviews on Amazon, I took a chance and bought this sequel to Underworld. In my defense, I had just seen the first Underworld, and I absolutely love it. I honestly thought that the sequel couldn't be as bad as the reviewers said it was. Silly rabbit. I am just at a loss to see how the writers and director of the first movie could have made this stinker. Everything that was so good about the first movie - the acting, good (simple) special effects, and an actual story - seemed absent from Underworld:Evolution. And what was with the yucky sex scenes? It just goes to show that the best movies are always low-budget. So, my advice is to save yourself a similar fate and just enjoy the first Underworld (which is still awesome).
1932100660|1.0|This book is an incredible disappointment.  The author's prose is dull...perhaps to indicate that this is SCIENCE, but in fact the book is \\"weird science\\".  It suggests that a conspiracy exists to befuddle the American public about dietary matters.  It suggests that much research is bad science, yet accepts the 1985 Chinese cancer study as gospel?  Having seen the way China handled avian flu, and HIV, why should we believe this?    Page after page, chapter after chapter the author drags you through studies going back 50 years arriving at a contrarian position.  Frankly, you have to ask yourself, if vegans were leading amazingly healthy, prolonged and cancer-free lives this WOULD HAVE BEEN NOTED again and again in all societies and throughout history.  The elaborate \\"proofs\\" offered here should not be necessary...it should be an observable fact.    I honestly believe that the people who rave about this book, have not really read it.  This SHOULD be an exciting topic, but even if the author makes it boring...it should be CONVINCING, and this book fails to convince.
6304711891|5.0|I don't like Nicholas cage at all. He is one of the most annoying obnoxious people of all time. I cannot stand his voice or anything else. so I am not talking about the follow up line to the coolest line in this movie or in many other movies.     Do you remember when the man Sean Connery said the following line : \\"Losers complain Winners Go %&$# the prom queen.\\" That was the best line I have heard in a while. That was great. As far as cage's follow up line who cares. Sean Connery is the man.     I know that wasn't much of a reveiw but that was great.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|I was completely astounded from start to finish! At first listen the radio friendly cuts grab you: Leave Out All The Rest, Shadow Of The Day..and while these are supreme LP cuts its the edgier stuff that really takes the cake: Given Up, Hands Held High, Valentine's Day is classic LP and would've fit in place on any LP album. Theres inspiration, innovation, and versatility everything you love about LP is alive and well and dare I say...better. The album is perfect start to finish, nuff said so stop hatin and download: Given Up, No More Sorrow
0060887966|1.0|I picked up The Alchemist because it looked like the kind of \\"makes you think\\" book I enjoy. Besides it's perpetual place on best sellers lists, I was intrigued by the book's name and synopsis. A classic case of judging a book by its cover. Much to my dismay, The Alchemist was hardly the kind of reading material I expected. Far from intriguing, the book was terrible. If you'd like a full blown account of its foibles, check out some of the other reviews. Suffice it to say, the universe and life do not work as easily and as magically as Coehlo's fable insists. The Alchemist provides an easy and uplifting answer for humanly existence - it oversimplifies what it means to live, to succeed, and to fail. No wonder the general public finds something so worthwhile in its message. It strives to reach those who prefer the easy answer over the right one.
0316067598|5.0|After hearing this story on MSN & a course had to buy the book from Amazon immediately. After receiving it I can say I read it less then 24 hours.... I couldn't put the book down! I wouldn't be able to ever thank the seal's or all those men/women who - everday risk their lives for us - thankyou Mr. Luttrell for sharing your story & thankyou for risking your live(s) (your friends) to help U.S. blood! I do now have a much admiration and upmost respect for MILITARY especially any such force like SEALS, GREEN ADES, etc! You are a TRUE HERO & WARRIOR... many thanks & love from us in CALIFORNIA!

B000PFUAO6|1.0|Okay, I'm a huge Dream Theater fan.  I truly think they reached their apogee with albulms like Scenes From a Memory, 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulance, and Train of Thought.  Octovarium had some good songs, but a lot of pedestrian songs too that sounded too \\"dumbed down\\".  I was hoping Chaos would be a return to the Train of Thought days, but it fell way short in my estimation.<br /><br />I've tried to give it several listens, but it's just not clicking with me.  First of all the Christian undertones are so thick it's almost like smacking you with a bible.  Which, is fine if that's what you're into.  I personally am not and if this is the direction they are turning I will most likely stop buying their albums.  I don't believe in doomsday, and if I did there are plenty of dedicated Christian bands for that sort of thing.<br /><br />On the other hand, had this come along 10 years ago, I would probably have liked those undertones.  Perhaps that's the difference now that I'm a freethinker, though I put the lyrics aside and just tried to enjoy the music and I can't.  It just doesn't have that \\"click\\" factor.  It still has complexity, but it's a complexity that seems devoid of form or purpose like they've lost their way and are just going through the motions.
0767802659|5.0|I have never seen the entire movie. I always catch this movie in the middle of it. But from what I have seen this is one of the worst movies ever. But that is what makes it great. Lame monsters and terrible over dramatic acting team up to make a B movie classic. Now if you think this is an actual \\"good\\" movie you have some issues. If you appreciate cheese flowing through your tv screen into your living and down the hall out of the window and down the street then this is for you.
B000OVLBEO|2.0|I'm watching the movie on DVD and the jail scene is on, which prompted me to write this review.<br /><br />Totally against national statistics, this holding cell is full of white guys.  The proceed to beat-up \\"Ghost Rider\\".  The 1 black kid in the cell is of course the nice one who tries to get them to not beat him up.  Go figure.  Then of course he turns into the flaming head Ghost Rider and beats all the white dudes up.<br /><br />Totally blew the movie for me.<br /><br />Not only that, but the whole movie is slow.  Reminded me alot of Blade... but suckier.  It even had Sam Elliot playing the exact same part as in Blade.<br /><br />So unless you want to see a cool flaming Harley, this movie pretty much sucks.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|Ever since I got this CD as a gift from my father inlaw I got somehow addicted to it. It is a perfect east-west blend in during a time when all we see is political-cultural rift between the two.    Much of the melodies are inspired by the region. One is actually a fully adapted turkish theme that my grandmother used to play in her lute, very well known under different names in the middle east (Iraq and Syria it is Mughram wisalak), that is Sacred Shabbat. Other melodies blend in Celtic, and new age with Oriental Instruments in such a magnificient way.    Good for you Loreena and I cannot wait to hear your Night in Al Hambra album. Cannot wait to see you live in Concert here in Dubai.    Actually since I heared this CD I became an avid fan of Loreena that I got all her CDs, but the impression that \\"An Ancient Muse\\" is still unique among the others.
1594489505|4.0|After reading The Kite Runner, I was extremely excited about reading Hosseini's newest book. Although A Thousand Splendid Suns was an intricate story about complex characters, it was confusing having to switch back and forth between the characters narrarrating in every chapter. Other than that, the story was wonderful and really gave a different perspective about the adversities that women face in Afghanistan and the world as a whole.
B000002H4C|2.0|I've been looking for another recording of Elmer Bernstein's grand music called the \\"symphonic score\\" from HEAVY METAL that I once had on vinyl but lost in a house-fire.  Does anyone know where I could find it perhaps on compact disc?
1596912855|5.0|What a creative premise for a novel. It had me laughing from cover to cover. A definite must-read for Austen fans everywhere. Shannon Hale is definitely one of my favorite writers and her first non-young adult novel did not disappoint. Highly entertaining.
B000NA1OXY|5.0|I bought this CD for \\"Girlfriend\\" and ended up loving the whole thing.  I especially enjoy \\"When your gone.\\"  My boyfriend is in Iraq being brave and fighting in the war for his third time and this is the hardest one.  This song comforts me and I am so happy that I bought the cd and found this song.  5 starts definatly.  Go AVRIL!
B000QFCD2W|5.0|In the King We Trust increible disco igual o mejor que su anterior trabajo. Rif bien heavy y uso una combinacion de sus voces q hace del album uno no monotono. Para mi estos dos ultimos album the Diamond han sido los mejores en los pasados 15 años.
0316010669|4.0|Gladwell supplies you with extensive research and reliable sources to convince you of something you may have experienced already.<br /><br />It's called a hunch, a gut feeling maybe even intuition and what's more it can be learned! At least that's what the research Gladwell points us to suggests. Like The Tipping Point he brings experts together to compile the data - his fly-on-wall approach is convincing because he doesn't offer his own opinion so much as offering evidence found by others - it makes him a credible witness. You feel as if you're along for the ride as much as he is.<br /><br />The premise is convincing because anyone can relate to it, but he takes it step further and suggests one can learn how to have hunches and accurate ones too. It also suggests that our intuition may be buried and just needs some coaxing out.<br /><br />One is left fascinated by the human mind and wondering what junk or treasure has found its way in there and if you have used your mind to its full potential. The examples and case studies are interesting and relevant keeping you hooked and wanting to know more. You feel educated and equipped, perhaps even a little academic if you're learning this stuff for the first time.<br /><br />Most of it is explanation rather than discovery, but it is an entertaining explanation. Once again Gladwell found a unique thread to pull on - and the unraveling is worth the read.
0316113077|5.0|Wow...I have TONS of cookbooks as I am a baker as well as a Cookbook collector.  I am speechless at the beauty of each page in this book.  Elisa does a phenomenal job at giving step by step decorations.  If you are gonna try something from the book, I would recommend starting with the cookies first to get your feet wet, the graduate to cup cakes and then mini-cakes etc.  You can do this with time and patience...If you don't have time, patience and SOME skill just buy it for the pictures!  It is a great conversation piece for a table.
B00005JPQT|5.0|What can I add to the earlier reviews? They've done a good job of conveying what this film is like. I'll just add a few thoughts.<br /><br />I've seen the film twice so far but even after the first viewing it was already on my must-buy list as soon as a DVD with extras is available. And I noticed that despite some of the over-the-top action (I really could have done without the silly fight with a jet) I actually liked it BETTER with repeat viewing. I caught a number of details that added to the story and it didn't lose any of the fun.<br /><br />Some have written that they thought Justin Long played his character as too frightened. I disagree. I thought it was completely realistic for a computer geek with little life experience suddenly facing real-world violence and people trying to kill him. Furthermore, it provided a nice contrast to MacClane's calm. I liked it.<br /><br />I don't know how much of the clever banter was due to the script or clever ad lib, but I still find myself chucking over it. There are some really great (and memorable) lines in the film. I suspect people will be quoting the dialogue for years.<br /><br />It should also be mentioned that Kevin Smith does an amazing job with his small, but important role. You can feel the energy level in the theatre ramp up as soon as the Warlock appears onscreen. I loved the scene of him sleeping with his keyboard. It isn't easy to make a battle between hackers tense and exciting, but Kevin Smith and Justin Long both pull it off (and I howled with laughter at the e-bomb scene). Come the DVD, I know that Kevin Smith's scenes will be probably be some of the ones I go back to see the most.<br /><br />At first, I agreed with the critics who said it was probably the best sequel, although not as good as the original film. Then I sat down and watched the three earlier films in order again. And guess what? It's actually better than the original, which memory had added a gloss to. Willis has grown a LOT as an actor and it shows. The story is bigger, the stakes higher. The threat is both timely and frighteningly believable. And although the villain here is no Alan Rickman, I thought the supporting cast all did a great job. Justin Long and Kevin Smith are particularly good in their roles as Matt Farrell and the Warlock (AKA Freddie) and added a lot of fun and interest to the film. I loved the chemistry between Justin (who by his own admission plays something of a damsel in distress) and Bruce. Nor is Justin useless. He's a clever guy when in his element, which is computers. It's delightful watching a friendship grow between the two characters, and there is something of a passing-of-the-hero-torch from MacClane to Farrell during the film. As a friend of mine would say, the story has heart.<br /><br />What can I say? Die Hard was great, but it's a bit dated now. Die Hard 2 was pretty good, and fared well on re-viewing. Die Hard with a Vengeance was mediocre. But Live Free or Die Hard is, to my own surprise, the best of the lot. If you liked any of the others, you have to see this one.<br /><br />Finally, there's talk of a possible Die Hard 5. All I can say now is that I sure hope so, especially if Justin Long is teamed up again with Bruce Willis (perhaps as a son-in-law!). Good chemistry is a rare and wonderful treat. You can never get too much of it.<br /><br />Yippe ki yay!es higher. The threat is both timely and frighteningly believable.

B00000DHZJ|5.0|An excellent Hendrix compilation.  All of the famous stuff still played on the radio is on here, as well as lesser-knowns.  Definitely get this if a Hendrix fan.  20 tracks, over an hour of music.  Great value.
B000QFAJ7S|5.0|Kelly's new CD is probably one of the most underestimated albums that has recently been released. I've heard many people compare this to her previous albums and by doing so, the differences will be made apparent and most people consider it a negative. Sure this album may not have the same sound as Breakaway, but this album is much more personal and musically artistic. Just like Mandy Moore's newest album, I find this album to be another breathe of fresh air from the standard pop and rnb songs that tend to be overplayed on the radio. The lyrics are beautifully written, of all the CD Sober and Haunted are by far my favorites. Never Again, as many have probably noticed, sounds much like a track from Breakaway and the rest of the album is not too similar to Never Again, but this can be a good thing! Overall I would highly recommend this album, it's perfect to just have playing in the background, and I commend Kelly for fighting to put this album out!
B000803CU2|5.0|I need not say anything regarding the album itself. However I once owned a digital remaster of this in 1994. Perhaps it was an Australia only product, but I haven't seen it for sale anywhere since. Hope this helps the other reviewer.
B00005Y1TL|5.0|This Album is an all out classic. It is arguably the greatest Ambient album of all time. I highly reccomend it. Each track although sounding similar are very different. the only track that doesn't fit here(and I am not alone) is green Calx, it's much too abrasive, almost like something from James' other moniker Caustic Window    If you want a piece of electronic history I think it's a must have. If you enjoy BOC and early Autechre and Seefeel work than it is also a must have.
B000F6IOC0|4.0|I love the concept of this story.  Great visuals.  I do think it gets a little sketchy on the details toward the end though.
B000RE1RR4|5.0|So I wasn't too sure about The Closer at first. I like Kyra Sedgwick, but I'm burned out on cop shows. This one, however, hooked me with the basics: great writing, characters I want to know better, killer mysteries and ... a smart balance between personal interactions and crime-solving.    I was afraid the whole \\"Southerner in LA\\" thing would be a wearing affectation. It's not. Deputy Chief Brenda Leigh Johnson's accent and slight fish-out-of-waterness adds to things without becoming a crutch.    The greatest reward is watching how relationships develop over time, how Johnson goes from being regarding with suspicion (and worse) to someone who delivers. Winning over her squad does not happen easily, which makes it all the more real and rewarding. And winning them over doesn't suddenly mean everything's rosy. Also real. Also rewarding.    As engaging as the crime and suspects are the players in the internal political dramas. Brenda's not only dealing with killers, she's dealing with sharks in her own waters.
0440241901|3.0|Reminiscent of Bridget Jones, Emma Corrigan is trying to succeed (albeit, desperately at times)- in life, work, and love.  In her new job as a marketing assistant, she hasn't been asked to do much.  Basically she is a secretary with a glorified title.  Due to scheduling conflicts, she is the only one available to visit a client to close a deal.  All she had to do was work out some minor details.  Needless to says, things don't work out very well and that is despite her valiant efforts.  On the plane ride home, there is quite a bit of turbulence that scares Emma into revealing ALL her secrets to the handsome American man sitting next to her.  Unbeknownst to Emma, that man happens to be the CEO of her company, Jack Harper.  EEK!!!     There are some great, laugh-out-loud moments that result-  Jack enjoys hinting at her secrets, making Emma nervous, even though no one else catches the double meanings...    Though, I didn't enjoy the story as much as the Shopaholic books, it is still a fun read.  My big complaint is that there is a lot more instances of profanity than in Ms. Kinsella's other books- the f-word has no purpose or meaning other than being a horribly crass and ineffectual way of expressing oneself.  A disappointment for me, but others may not be bothered.  Overall a light, breezy, fun, quick read! Great for a day at the beach or a long car ride...
B000F1IQN2|4.0|We have gotten awfully used to the defense of inaction in this country. From Kindergarten on, we are told to turn the other cheek, tell the teacher, sticks and stones... blah, blah, blah. Here, however, is another take on this dilemma, one terribly relevant, it would seem, in this time of arbitrary killings, defended by grinning thugs. We can wring our collective hands or we can act. This film takes on this subject in a time when America's revenge genre, the Western, has gone out of fashion. \\"Munich\\" really is \\"The Unforgiven\\" set in Europe. The killers are hunted down and killed in return. It's more or less as simple as that, but here one is asked to identify with the assassins and to ask oneself if it would be as easy as it may have seemed, in so many movies where the good guys catch up with the bad guys. It's a film built around an ethical issue, a real issue, it seems to me. The film is not fully satisfying, but it is hard to say why. The acting is fantastic. I came away thinking the ending was weak. The entire sequence is New York seemed soft and sentimental suddenly and out of keeping with the film. The screen play by Kushner has other weaknesses. For example, I had trouble accepting that these guys would be so amateurish. Each killing is botched, which, were the assassins American, would seem believable but, given that they are Israeli, the finest intelligence units the world, it seemed somehow contrived. The setting is great, the subject matter thankfully adult, and it is finally a political film, which is a rare and fine thing.
B000005RT8|5.0|Not really. That was a title the great Macca briefly considered for a solo project while he was still in The Beatles.  Some listeners of this CD will most certainly think \\"goes too far\\" is an apt description of some of the music here;I hated it the first time I heard it (on vinyl) many years ago,but the more I listened to it,the more I have grown to love it-just because IT IS so quirky. It sounds like Paulie is exorcizing himself of the trauma of his pot bust and incarceration in Japan by producing some of most extreme and experimental music he's capable of. When he was a Beatle,he was a student of Stockhausen,the avant-garde classical composer of the late '60's and perhaps this CD is as close as we'll ever get to any Macca music that can be traced back to his love of Stockhausen.  Maybe-or maybe not. I could be totally wrong. I like this CD-it is very challenging.
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|All I can say is...you go girl. No, not really, otherwise this would be a really short review. \\"My December\\" is awesome, it shows so much expansion for Clarkson's musical eptitude - and that she's not willing to just be some manufactured pop sensation.  I know there has been a lot of drama regarding this release, and her relationship could have suffered if the music was substandard - fortunately it is not. It's mostly upbeat, and while maybe not as top 40 as Breakaway, certainly it's worthy of repeated listenings, and sing alongs (even if mainly in a faux-angsty mood at times.)  1. Never Again - upbeat, angry Kelly, it took a few listens for me to like this songs at first, but it really has grown on me. 9/10  2. One Minute - even more upbeat, it incorporates funk, and is probably the fastest song on the album. Ironic lyrics in tow Can't wait for this to be a single, if only for remixes, and you know the remixes are going to set the dance floors on fire. 10/10  3. Hole - the loudest of the rock songs, also rather dark, but still manages to get people singing, or screaming....8/10  4. Sober - The best of the ballads, and the best of the lyrics. Should be the biggest hit from the album, and takes a break from being angry Kelly to reflective Kelly.10/10  5. Don't Waste Your Time - Rock/pop fomula song, I guess it's one of two concessions Clarkson made to keep in with what the producers and record label wanted, while it's still got some of her new, rockier sound on it. I see this as being the most \\"in line\\" with top 40 radio today, this ranges somewhere between power ballad and mid tempo rocker. Gets back into the angry Kelly mode, but not as much as the next song... 9/10  6. Judas - Kind of funky as well at the beginning, but takes you on a rollercoaster rock ride. Not made for top 40, but one of my personal favorites. 10/10  7. Haunted - Eeire power ballad, written apparently about the death of a friend. To me the lyrics are great, but the way the verse is sung is somewhat forgettable, but the chorus is very powerful. 7/10  8. Be Still - sounds like \\"old\\" kelly. Not really my thing, its' more of a soulful ballad. If you like old Kelly this may be for you though. 5/10  9. Maybe - Starts of as an acoustic song, but halfway through it kicks into a powerful mid tempo rock/folk power ballad. After a couple of songs of non-angst she starts to show it again. 7/10  10. How I Feel - Like \\"Dont' Waste Your Time\\" this song sounds fomulaic for pop radio. Fast paced and enjoyable, and not as angry as just....well, convinced that how the world is, is how the world is. You have to listen to the lyrics to know what I mean. 9/10  11. Yeah - Kind of country, kind of jazz, and kind of funky soul and rock. Mid tempo. 8/10  12. Can I Have A Kiss - A...weird song, but enjoyable. Kind of countryish at first but it gets into triple A rock sound. A FUN song, very laughable (in a good, fun way) in it's lyrics. 10/10  13. Irvine - Lyrically fantastic, and many are raving about this folkish ballad, but to me..it's forgettable as a song. If only she'd just made this as a poem, but it could be I'm not big on folk or Americana music. 5/10  Total score 8.2 out of 10.    So she's advanced from Breakaway, maybe gotten a little angrier, but you know what, at least it sounds different from the pop Breakaway was..not to say it was bad, BA was a great album, but this is NOT Breakaway Part II, it's unique in it's own sound, even if the attitude is much the same.  Already awaiting album #4 from Ms. Clarkson.
B000S0DDG0|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I rented Dreamgirls (using my awesome Tivo/Amazon Unboxed!).  I was a fan of Jennifer Hudson from my intermittant viewing of American Idol.  She blew me away! I feel that she stole the show! I thought she was just an extra back up singer or something, I didn't realize that she was a main player. Many times during the movie, I was brought to tears with her powerful voice and great acting!  Bravo, Jennifer!  Not to be forgotten, was the other big talent that did not disappoint.  I felt that the movie did a great job to keep your attention with the icing on top of the cake being all the wonderful talent involved with the project.  This was Jennifer's \\"introduction\\" movie, and man did she make an impression!  I will remember this movies as a favorite!
B0000DJZ8R|5.0|To quote the amazon.com editorial review, \\"Ranking No. 21 on the American Film Institute's list of the 100 greatest American films, this 1940 classic is a bit dated in its noble sentimentality\\".  Now in 2007 it drops to 23rd place on AFIs list and a point i find that people don't bring up is the welfare system and how in that respect it is more important today than ever in showing why and for who a welfare system is in place for and how terribly flawed and manipulated it is today.  I know this movie is a classic and won oscars and was directed by one of the great directors John Ford.  Most know the story, or had to read it in high school, and it makes most best lists.  It is a history lesson and teaches unionization, and it is all these things.  The thing that stuck with me the most was the end and what a safe haven the agricultural farm put in place by the government was for the Joads.  It safed there lives.  There were dances and they could eat and help pay there way by helping in the camp.  However the Joads did not want a hand out and even though if work came after all they had been through, starvation, losing family members, treated like pigs, they deserved the right to stay in that safe camp, nobody would criticize them for not jumping at the first job that came along that might turn out to be another nothing.  As soon as 20 days of work came up they packed everything they owned into that car that might not even make their destination and they left the government camp, and happily.  All they wanted to do was work and they basically were taken advantage of and walked on and not allowed to do the one thing they wanted.  In 2007 we have totally healthy and able bodied people in there early twenties collecting social security, or waiting for the end of the month for the welfare check to come in.  Perhaps have more and more children because that check at the end of the month will be fatter.  I knew a kid when i was in the national guard that unknowingly to the government stayed with his girlfriend on welfare rent free while he worked, he actually said he loved the ghetto and he d stay there forever.  I actually liked him barring the last ignorant statement but he was young and i'm guessing didn't have the best influences to think like that.  The Joads didn't have money to eat but you can bet most now a day that are able bodied and can work and choose not to will get there cigarettes.  Say you get involved with drugs mess yourself up and you can't work well then you can get disability.    So with everything this movie is, in this day and age that is the message that rang loudest to me.  I also realize there are many like the Joads today that fall upon hard times and a government assisted program is a safe haven to them also, and i am not judging all, but talking about the one's that are manipulating and taking advantage.  Perhaps before you are allowed to go on housing or welfare maybe it should be mandatory to watch The Grapes of Wrath and the Joads struggle.
B00005JPLW|4.0|Filmed in similar fashion to Sin City but in my view this is a far far better film. Good story, good character's and good acting too. Sin City certainly lacked in those areas to my mind. Anyhow, back to 300. In a nut shell I highly recommend the movie and enjoyed it a lot more than I expected, lives up to the hype and has the edge over the similar movie \\"Troy\\" also.
B000683VI4|5.0|A must have! This is by far one of the best movies I've ever watched. After witnessing a few scenes from this movie I just had to go out and buy it and I don't regret it!     \\"The Notebook\\" breaks away from the typical kind of chick flick and adds a touch of humor. The movie adds more focus to the character's first Summer together, unlike the book which I found to be quite a snoozer. Also, the character's personalities seems more realistic and have more depth to them as you will discover during their heated arguements. Noah's personality is so dreamy and you can't help but fall in love with him over and over again.     I found many differences between the book and movie, but I won't spoil it for you if you haven't seen either. :3 This movie definately allows you to take a step back and appreciate the relationship you have with your loved one.
B000H0MKGK|4.0|While Mayer's first recording was definately in the \\"pop\\" category, this third release after the bluesy \\"Try\\" is much more difficult to pigeon-hole. There are some really great tunes on this one and it would be hard for me to choose a favorite. The blues show their face once again as our poor hero falls in and out of love. The really good news is John's talented guitar playing shines like a beacon in fog-filled musical world littered with so many \\"three chord Johnnies\\" out there. After this disc first came out, I caught some of the songs being used in the background of popular TV shows. I remember hearing Gravity on an episode of House and I think they also used Slow Dancing In A Burning Room as well. Both solid songs from Mr. Mayer. If you have not heard this disc, trust me and buy it for some superb rocking blues guitar work.
B000I5YCCO|5.0|This is the best Debut album ever!! You can tell that every song means alot to her! My favorite songs are: Tim Mcgraw, Cold as you, A place in this world, The outside, stay beautiful and Should've said no. You should buy this cd!
B000PY52EU|5.0|Black Snake Moan sure has a weird hook.  Setting: Deep South.  An older black man who plays the blues keeps a white nymphomaniac on a chain to cure her of her horniness.  About half-way through, my husband turned to me and said \\"And why exactly did you think I would like this movie?\\"  I winced and said I thought it would have blues as more of a central theme.  But guess what, he stayed around and pronounced it a good movie after all!  His summary is the best: \\"everyone has their struggles, and you are never really free of them.\\"<br /><br />The performances are exceedingly strong, the setting of Tennessee bucolic and beautiful.  You really feel as if you are in this small, rural town where everyone knows each other.<br /><br />Black Snake Moan is bold, and really gives you a sense of empathy for the different characters.  Most importantly, it provides hope that if you have your own struggles, someone will be out there for you as well, not to judge you or cure you, but to love you.
B00005JPQT|5.0|It is too bad that Bruce Willis can't crank out this films more often.  John McClain is probably the greatest action hero in all film history and this installment packs a wallop with a slew of action and humor.    McClain is asked to bring a suspected computer hacker to be interviewed by the FBI.  The actor playing this hacker is the guy who does the Apple McIntosh comercials.  It is interesting to note that he seem to prefer a Mac in this one.  Anyway, McClain shows up just as the hacker is about to be hit by the bad guys.  Were it any other movie it would be a guy with a magnum or piano wire, but being a Die Hard movie the bad guys come with ultra modern machine guns.  Of course McClain is able to take some of them out and temporarily get away with the hacker.  Thus we have the makings of a great partnership as good as any to the Lethal Weapons movies.    The movie has you cheering throughout, especially when McClain taunts the head bad guy about offing one of his key henchpersons and then telling him I'm coming to get you.      Kevin Smith has a larger cameo as Warlock, a live at home with his mother computer hacker.  It is a role that seems to have been made for him.    This is the best Die Hard since the first movie!
B00005JPHT|5.0|Sicko is a masterpiece! It left me feeling like I was living in the wrong country. The United States, the \\"Greatest Country In The World?\\" Hogwash! More like, \\"the best brainwashed\\" people in the world!\\"<br /><br />Other countries have their priorities straight, that is Canada, France, and even demonized \\"Third-World\\" Cuba! In the United States, where we pride ourselves for our \\"freedom\\" and \\"fair play,\\" we tolerate a Heath Care system which gives hard-working, medically-insured, middle class people the freedom to die, in order to maximize corporate profits! And, God help you if you don't have Health Insurance in the United States - it's \\"fair play\\" to literally dump you in the front of a homeless shelter in a hospital gown while you're disoriented. I mean, you can't afford treatment so let the Catholic Church, or some other third party, play doctor at an emergency shelter!<br /><br />While we have been brainwashed about the evils of Fidel Castro's Cuba, the vast majority  of the residents of  present day \\"Communist\\" China would be slobbering all over themselves to have  such advanced and universal medical care as Cuba does. For Pete's sake, it took China many years just to get HIV out of their domestic blood supply! But yet, no one in authority, dares demonize \\"Red\\" China. Why? Because our two governments are in bed with each other to such a degree neither really cares what the other does to its own people! But Cuba, which is exporting medical breakthroughs, like vaccines, to the entire world, is Public Enemy # 1! Why? Because they won't obey our \\"American\\" rules with regards to screwing their own people out of benefits such as Universal Health care!<br /><br />I don't for a second think any country is perfect, whether it be Canada, France, Cuba or any other nation, for that matter. But, when a country that is so incredibly wealthy, powerful and technologically advanced, as the United States, lets numerous people suffer and/or die solely to maximize corporate profits, then it's time for marching in the streets! Maybe we all should be taking lessons from the French! They know how to bring their government to its knees in order to benefit the many over the few!<br /><br />[[ASIN:0199204780 Brainwashing: The Science of Thought Control]]  [[ASIN:B000HYXSDU Handbook For Nonviolent Action]]  [[ASIN:0520082982 Healing the Masses: Cuban Health Politics at Home and Abroad]]  [[ASIN:B000FI953A On revolutionary medicine.(speech by revolutionary Che Guevara to Cuban Militia)(socialized medicine in Cuba)(Speech) : An article from: Monthly Review]]marching in the streets!

0060763892|5.0|James Rollins does what many authors fail to do: He continues to get better.  While I still believe 'Map of Bones' to be his best all-around novel, 'The Judas Strain' is certainly no light-weight follow-up.  This is great storytelling, simply put.  While you would be hard-pressed to find an action/adventure oriented novel by almost ANY author that doesn't stretch the limits of credibility to SOME extent, I like that no matter how difficult some of Rollins' stories seem to be, he manages to put enough believable science into the mix to make what would otherwise be hard to swallow right into the What If category.<br /><br />I liked the premise from the first page, which is ALWAYS a good sign in my book.  The voyage of Marco Polo from Asia back to Italy was beset by some kind of major tragedy which nearly wiped out all those who participated on the journey...a voyage which Marco never spoke about to seemingly anyone, even at his deathbed...or DID he?  Yet another fantastic What If scenario begins as we jump to the modern day world where what seems to be a particularly nasty plague is infecting, and then altering the very DNA of those inflicted.  It seems to be originating from the ocean, and after a very short time, scientists from Sigma Force kidnapped by the infamous Guild are working side-by-side attempting to stop what could very well be a planet-wide catastrophe.  As always, those in the Guild may or may NOT be what they seem, and all the while we factor in the Vatican and surprisingly the possibility of an actual language of the Angels being translated which somehow seems to be all connected.  But to what end?  Never fear...Mr. Rollins has control, and he takes us on another thrilling roller-coaster ride that never fails to entertain as well as inform -- which always seem to be the best kind of books to read (IMHO).<br /><br />For those familiar with the novels by Rollins, this is one of those No Brainer decisions: you simply MUST get this book, it really IS awesome...however, for those who may be new to these books, by all means, buy, read and then run to go purchase the complete works by Mr. Rollins.  IF you have the chance, while you do not have to, I would buy and read his books in the order they were released.  Entertainment written by a real master...and definitely worth the wait.  Kudos again to James Rollins boundless imagination.  Now the wait for the NEXT Sigma Force novel begins...for those who may be new to these books, by all means, buy, read and then run to go purchase the complete works by Mr. Rollins.  IF you have the chance, while you do not have to, I would buy and read his books in the order they were released.  Entertainment written by a real master...and definitely worth the wait.

B000FP2OPY|5.0|Awesome set.  Started watching this television show in the middle of season two and couldn't get enough.  I have completed the first season and will probably watch it again I enjoyed it so much.  Definitely purchasing season two which becomes available on 9/11/2007.
0753820250|5.0|Oh to be loved as Julian loved Penelope. This is one of the best fiction books I have read in years. I wanted to read it again as soon as I finished it but I was afraid I would take off on a plane to Barecelona.<br />Bravo!
B000002KAT|5.0|Half the songs on here give me goosebumps. Astral Weeks is probably my favorite Van Morrison album, granted Tupelo Honey and Moondance are a lot more fun, Astral weeks is transcendental. In this album Van seems very in love, nostalgic, or sentimental. Key tracks (really all of them) include:  Astral Weeks- Strong and solid,   Sweet Thing- The strings in this are awesome  Cyprus Avenue- More like familiar Van Morrison  Madame George- It's long, and good. Again and as usual, an awesome arrangement. (for David Gray fans, this is where part of \\"Say Hello, Wave goodbye comes from)    The other tracks on here are all good, no real dancing numbers, but all the songs are beautiful, the kind you put on a mix CD for a new (or not so new) love. Anyone who considers themselves a Van fan had better own this.
B0009X766Y|5.0|I'd been waiting for a long time for a special edition of this remarkable film, and was disapointed when I read that it that it was the inauthentic \\"widescreen\\" version, and that it came with merely a small documentary, and neither commentary nor deleted scenes.     I judged way too quickly.     The cutting off of small parts of the top and bottom of the frame are not dramatic, and having seen both versions of the film, I don't feel I've lost anything here.     More importantly, the documentary is wonderful, including new interviews with Newman, Redford, David S. Ward, Ray Walston, Dimitra Arliss, Charles Durning, and a radiant and remarkably recovered from her stroke Eileen Brennan.    And though I wish there had been commentary, the documentary makes it clear that the script was so tight, there was probably little additional material left to add.    This is one of those wonderful cases where less is better, and I love having it in my collection.
074356619X|1.0|I thought my head was going to explode!!!!  Save some money here is the secret.....Think good thoughts..
0316779237|2.0|I'm a huge fan of David Sedaris' books, but other than the \\"Santaland Diaries\\" and \\"Dinah\\" stories, I couldn't get into it. The other stories weren't funny, the pace was plodding despite the fact that these were short stories, and I was actually somewhat uncomfortable reading them.    I'd recommend most of his other books, just not this one.
1582701709|1.0|I have read a lot of motivational, or self help books over 20 years. It's hard to believe this one is a best seller. It's not worth one star.<br /><br />The premise is that what you think about becomes reality. If you are sick of bills coming in the mail every week, imagine checks coming in the mail instead, and it will happen. Huh? We all have utility bills, credit card bills, and mortgage/rent bills to pay. You can't imagine them away.<br /><br />\\"The Secret\\" also says if you worry about something, you will attract it and it will happen. Hogwash!. I have known people who obsessed about death and especially dying young in an horrible accident, such as a plane crash or car crash. Fortunately, they are still with us and entering their golden years just fine. They didn't attract anything from the universe.<br /><br />There are athletes who think night and day about winning a world championship. Except, only one team can win it each year in any league. Many goal-oriented superstars never achieve their ultimate goal. How can the universe deliver all the thoughts and dreams of all these motivated athletes? It can't. That's the dirty little secret.<br /><br />The best motivational books tell you that you are the captain of your future. No gimmicks. No shortcuts. Put your past behind you and bootstrap. Push through obstables. Never quit. Resolve to become better and start working on whatever it is you need from life.
0312426984|4.0|I enjoyed this book. The unusual, but sophisticated writing style was refreshing.    The plot about a 40 year old woman falling for a 20 year-old college student-a bit hard to relate to (I'm 43- and 20 is way too young for moi) but so what -the writing and plot were strong enough to carry this novel. The unanswered ending was totally appropriate for this one.
0316067598|5.0|I started reading this book on Sunday morning and had to cancel my plans for the day to make time to finish it. It was a great read. I felt like I was actually in Afghanistan being pursued by a bunch of Taliban. The book is about exactly what the summary says it's about so I won't be redundant here. If you like a great war story buy this book.
B0002KVULG|4.0|[[ASIN:0800177177 Bram Stoker's Dracula]]<br />I tried for years to get a copy of this fine movie on DVD and, finally, Amazon has it!  The younger Frank Langella does a fine job of making the monster both suave, sophisticated, and seductive while also being very creepy and scary.  This particular movie leaves out the portion of the original novel which takes place in Transylvania and starts with the shipwreck in Britain.  It is well-paced. I also like how they don't get carried away with the special effects.  Dracula does not morph into monstrous creatures nor are there buckets of blood. The creepy effects are created by fine acting, direction, and cinematography.<br /><br />I didn't give this a 5 as I don't believe the definitive Dracula movie has been produced yet.  Cross this with the Gary Oldman version minus the graphic sexuality and overwhelming special effects (which extensively portrays the Transylvania portion of the novel and also has a fine actor in the title role) and you'd have the perfect movie.
B000OCXFCO|5.0|Let me start off with I havent been excited for a release of a cd in quite a while.  But I could not sleep the night before this cd came out.  Woke up very early and went to get this.    The opening Sleepwalkers: was the first to be blasted in the car on the way home from the purchase The riffs in that song are amazing and very skilled yet catchy.  Catchy and difficult riffs thats hard to come by    Washington is Next: Probably my second favorite on this cd this is a great track again with insane riffs. Great lyrics    Never Walk Alone... A Call To Arms the catchyest track on the cd other than ATLM the chorus is what gets ya     United Abominations: in my opinion the best track on the cd. Lyric wise I would say it defintly is Dave taking shots at the world and political idiots controlling the world, and agianst the UN, what is that any way ? Song is very inspirational and gets you pumped up. \\"The UN is right they cant be any more UN than they are right now ... \\" LMAO great line  Kind of makes you wonder if our allies are really our allies !!!    Gears of War: great track another political stance     Blessed our the dead: Apocalypse    Play for Blood: catchy not one of my favorites but good non the less    ATLM (Set ME Free) A faster pace than the original released on Youthanasia released in 1994 with the added vocals , this makes a great and suprising track on the cd    Amerikastan; another favorite of mine some great riffs in hear    You'Re Dead: good track not a favorite of mine however    Burnt Ice: another solid track     The Drover bro's are a really great edition to this cd. lets hope that they last and Dave doesnt get sick of his cast again     This better win Metal album of the year
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I had rented serenity in HD-DVD purely for the HD-DVD aspects of it. I loved the movie so much that I started researching it and finally got the Firefly Set from netflix. My wife and I fell in love with the cast, the superb editing, the witty dialogues and the overall sense of excellence about the series and the actor-character matchup. When we sat down to watch the last episode, it was so disappointing knowing that there were no more.     I am buying the set now and hopefully we'll learn those chinese slang curse words by heart and keep the legacy alive :-).
B00005JPRT|5.0|It is amazing how such a simple film can bring emotions from a depth that you never new existed within yourself. If only we all took the time to appreciate all of the simpler moments in our lives.<br />Truly a must see movie! If not for the story, then for the music. But mainly, for both. This is the only way I can \\"review\\" this film. I think each person needs to see it and experience it themselves.
0375704027|5.0|Quite possibly the saddest, yet most beautiful, story I have ever read.  Murakami drew me so deep into his world that there were times I had to stop reading and just put my head in my hands, it was so emotional.  I really felt like I was experiencing every detail with the characters.
B000OONQ9O|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars because i love it.This one of my all time fav's.Before i buy it.Can someone please tell me if this is the original cut from '79 or that awful re-issue that came out when the video game came out.Thank you for your time.Oh yeah in case you have not heard,MTV is remaking this movie.This time around it will be set in L.A. with Cryus as the leader.But you know it going to be worse then the comic book version.
B000EXZI14|5.0|\\"One Night Only\\" is a good a masterpiece of live recording as 1977's \\"Here At Last...Bee Gees...Live\\" was. All the great songs are here, plus a few odd album cuts that truly make this set shine. Highlights include, \\"Grease\\" with a thunderous crowd roaring approval; \\"(Our Love) Don't Throw It All Away', a true tearjerker with prerecorded Andy Gibb singing with his brothers and \\"Immortality\\", with a wonderful Celine Dion backed by the brothers. The CD is crisp, clean and clear. It is amazing to hear such fantastic producers who's studio recordings sound the same in concert. This is a classic CD!
0689865384|4.0|I enjoyed this book. It was really interesting to read. It took me a little effort to get into it at first, but after a few chapters I couldn't put it down. I am anxious to read the next two!
B00005JPFE|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />The city of Paris has never looked better - more richly-hued and elegant - than it does in \\"Ratatouille,\\" the latest product from Pixar Entertainment and the umpteenth animated film featuring an anthropomorphic animal as its lead character.<br /><br />Brad Bird`s confection brings two unlikely elements - food and rodents - together in its clever story of a rat with a passion for gourmet cooking who teams up with a newly hired \\"garbage boy\\" to surreptitiously whip up a whole host of savory dishes at an upscale restaurant located on the West Bank of Paris.<br /><br />\\"Ratatouille\\" is somewhat more cerebral and considerably less frenetic than the typical Pixar production, which may prove problematic for some of the younger folk in the audience.  And, indeed, there are times when the pacing does tend to drag a bit even for more seasoned moviegoers like myself.  Still, the action scenes are palpitating in their energy and excitement, and even those jaded by the unimaginable strides made in CGI technology over the years will be properly bowled over by what the filmmakers have managed to pull off here.  The sheer fluidity of movement alone in this film is draw-dropping in its impressiveness.  The story is rather less compelling overall, but one has to admire Bird's willingness to keep the drama at least somewhat intimate and life-sized.  The price of that subtlety, however, is that the movie is also a trifle dull in spots.<br /><br />The film is highly blessed with energetic voice work by the likes of Patton Oswalt, Ian Holm, Lou Romano, Brad Garrett, Peter O'Toole, and, above all, Janeane Garofalo as a high-strung, up-and-coming chef who doesn't take too kindly to fresh-out-of-the-oven competitors encroaching on her territory.<br /><br />But it is the exquisitely designed backdrops that finally make \\"Ratatouille\\" a thing of joy and beauty.  Bon appetit!
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Don't let the blu-ray fanboys deceive you. This is a great movie especially if you enjoy action movies in the style of Gladiator or Lord of the Rings. It has a little bit of medievil feel to it with some fantansy thrown in for good measure. It is a cinematic interpretation of a Frank Miller graphic novel and right now Frank Miller movies are on a roll. First Sin City and now this. If you didn't get a chance to catch this movie in theatres you are in for a real treat. Just be prepared for alot of blood and violence. And the hd dvd version will carry exclusive extras that you will not find on the standard version or the blu-ray version. This is why so many blu-ray fanboys are trying to give this video a bad rating. If this continues I think everyone that prefers hd dvd should begin going to the blu-ray reviews and give all of their high profile movies a bad review. On second thought we probably won't do that since most hd dvd owners have a life. We don't worry about silly stuff like format wars. Hey blu-ray fans go back to your products and stop giving bad reviews of other products just because you're jealous of another format.

0061142026|5.0|I really enjoy Gaiman's fantasy novels, and STARDUST is no exception.  This is essentially a fairy tale story, written in a simple style, but with a lot of grown-up elements thrown in.  The results are quite magical, and this is one of the most purely enjoyable books I've read in a while.<br /><br />If you like STARDUST, you should also try Gaiman's NEVERWHERE and CORALINE, which are both written in the same spirit.  Personally, I believe NEVERWHERE is the best of the three books, but they are all exceptionally good.
0451196716|5.0|The Long Walk is all about thoughts. The thoughts that would go through your mind if you were walking with 100 kids trying to be the last one standing so that you won't get shot. The concept itself is absurd, but it still holds possibility in our messed up world where Ultimate Fighting is becoming a huge sport. This book will stick in your mind for the rest of your life.
B000QQFKYE|4.0|\\"We are like the spider.<br />We weave our life and then move along in it.<br />We are like the dreamer<br />who dreams and then lives in the dream.<br />This is true for the entire universe.\\"<br /><br />These were the opening words that Lynch spoke during his introduction for INLAND EMPIRE at various theaters around the county in early 2007. If we are willing to trust Lynch's choice of words, this quote from the Upanishads opens a small window into the world of this film. Admiring any artists' work, requires a certain amount of trust in the artist. Their job is to ask questions (through their work) and our job is to verify what is true for ourselves. But that process is not necessarily a linear or an intellectual one. Such is the case with INLAND EMPIRE's complex meta-physical web. I consider this film to be a 21st century Alice in (a) wonderland (of hell). And in this film, hungry ghosts abound.<br /><br />Having read the Amazon reviews, I wanted to take mine in a slight different direction. Not since Eraserhead has Lynch had the artistic license and freedom to create a film so free of typical constraints. In this sense, this is his most \\"uncompromising\\" film yet. Having evolved further as a filmmaker, he has established his own distinct palette of colors from which to work. There is a good deal of continuity from one project to another and these qualities can be a clue as to the enigma that is INLAND EMPIRE. Lynch has described that some ideas for this latest endeavor had been with him for several years. This would suggest that there is a definite bridge between this and MULHOLLAND DRIVE. There are striking similarities.<br /><br />Despite our human nature to try to make sense of unfamiliar territory, Lynch is not only aware of this natural tendency, but not interested in explanations. His job is to create something very visceral within the narrative of a story infused by the world of ideals. This is what makes his work so damn challenging - we are so busy hanging on to \\"rationality,\\" we undervalue intuition and our ability to sense what we experience. It is also a testament to the many levels on which Lynch's films work. Rather than grasping at any \\"meaning\\" that may (or may not) be there, it is interesting to see how far we, as viewers, can allow ourselves to be absorbed into what we are seeing and experiencing. Lynch's ability to lay out very effective ground rules is what elevates his work into the realm of Hitchcock, Bunuel, Fellini, and others. And like a Buddhist sand mandala, what appears to be a flat one dimensional thing, turns out to be multi-dimensional house of many mansions. Lynch films are not for the passive.<br /><br />I would have to echo the sentiment that Lynch's work, does not have a \\"center\\" or a set \\"reality,\\" in a typical sense. Not taking this into account and trying to \\"figure out\\" meaning, if not fun for some, will be very frustrating for others. As is often the case, it is here that much unjustified criticism is leveled at Lynch (\\"weird for weirds sake\\") - which totally ignores the extraordinary thing he his doing cinematically. There are deep places he wishes to take the audience and therefore it is  important to understand that in a Lynch film, the only reality is the fact that he made a film and that there is an audience in the theater watching it. Beyond that, as in the dream world, you are on your own.<br /><br />When I first saw INLAND EMPIRE, I knew it was going to be a long movie, and I accepted the fact that I was about to pay money and, as if I was attending a carnival, going to be taken on a little ride (in tandem with a few thousand companions). Before I knew it, the ride was over and I found myself walking out of the theater, a little disoriented and wondering what the hell I just experienced. Woman in trouble, indeed. Amazing film. As Lynch has said: \\"...there is the story and then there is the way a story is told...\\"<br /><br />Uncharacteristically, there are about 40 DVD \\"chapterstops,\\" throughout the feature - though there is no menu nor are these stops named. Perhaps it was done because the film is almost 3 hours in duration, but Lynch addresses this issue during one of the interviews on the second disc. It seems that he has shifted his position on the matter and in doing so created these \\"stops\\" in the least obnoxious way possible. Also interesting to note is that there are at least 3 different cover artwork designs available. Just what we need: more doppelgangers! And some editions of the DVD come with a reproduction of the black and white INLAND EMPIRE movie poster.<br /><br />While premiering INLAND EMPIRE, Lynch spoke about what we could expect in terms of a DVD release mentioning that it was going to be fun and include some really great things.

0446310786|5.0|This book deserves to be called a classic. The story flows wonderfully and produces plot twists and turns that make it very interesting. This book obviously teaches us a great lesson on racism, but hidden is the lesson taught on fatherhood. Atticus is the type of father all men should strive to be. He is truthful, loving, and puts his neck out to teach his son good morals. Take this book for an enjoyable read and come back enlighted without even feeling that you were taught.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Shot in pristine color on location near Salzburg--and featuring that dizzying opening shot of Maria belting out the title tune from a verdant hilltop--\\"Music\\" fully deserves its reputation as one of the most popular films of all time. The daisy-fresh Andrews is simply terrific, whether she's acting or singing, and the songs--\\"Do Re Mi,\\" \\"Climb Every Mountain,\\" and \\"My Favorite Things\\"--have become part of our cultural heritage. Adapted from the Rodgers and Hammerstein Broadway play, the film might be a bit schmaltzy at moments, but in all, it remains utterly irresistible. The hills are still alive--and your singing pipes will be too--with the wondrous \\"Sound of Music.\\"
0385504209|5.0|This well researched book is as much an adventure as it is a compilation of secrets. You will learn things in this book that many people wish to keep from you. Historical facts in this book will make you question your religious viewpoints and your Church. I want to read all of Dan Brown's books. Don't forget to check out his website after you are finished the book. It is one the best author sites that I have ever seen and is a great source for more information on the book. Also don't forget the Webquest. It will take you on your own little race through the internet.
B000I2JDEY|5.0|An often agonizing, hilariously warped study of marital dysfunction, \\"Woolf\\" was the brainchild of first-time director Mike Nichols (who went on to make \\"The Graduate\\") and Ernest Lehman, who adapted Edward Albee's scabrous play. Nasty, vicious, and drenched in venomous wit, this is the ultimate Taylor-Burton collaboration, with plenty of ugly, soul-baring accusations to go around. Segal and Oscar winner Dennis make perfect counterpoints as the naïve young couple sucked into a nightmarish evening of \\"fun and games.\\"
0142004235|3.0|This was a good book but I cannot rave about it. I enjoyed wondering about Adam Trask's life with its ups and downs. The characters were very fascinating and the story line easily fit many of the characters into the events naturally. Yet, in this day and age, there seems little astonishing about the book. The whorehouse and the description of Cathy/Kate are heard everyday from city life. I hear about more unusual lives from the morning news. Yes, I know unusualness was not the purpose of this book. It was written so that we can see how relationships, lies, and love affect the normal and abnormal person (if there is such a thing). Relationships become the corner stone of our lives and build us to our full potential or in some cases break us down to nothing. So, choose your friends and family wisely.
B00000F14B|5.0|This exuberant, energetic adaptation of Meredith Wilson's hit Broadway musical is a bona fide marvel thanks to Robert Preston's virtuosic turn as the ultra-charming swindler. Homing in on small-town America in 1912, \\"Music Man\\" mixes nostalgic sentiment with real-world woes, memorably in the person of Ron Howard, who plays Marian's sullen younger brother Winthrop. Comedian Buddy Hackett adds levity as Hill's goofy sidekick, while Jones is a perfectly prim counterweight to Preston's engaging rogue. And let's not forget the songs: \\"Till There Was You\\" and the rollicking \\"76 Trombones\\" will leave you humming long after the lights go up.
0679437223|2.0|I recently read an article on the origin of Murphy's Law. For those of you that have never run across this law it states, \\"If anything can go wrong, it will.\\" This book seems to embody this thought and nothing else. \\"Catch-22\\" is a long list of things that go wrong with little hope for meaning or plot. Why is this book popular? I believe that many people can relate to a person that is always faced with problems and is surrounded by strange people. When I was reading this book I was able to find one person (I stress the one) who truly enjoyed it. This single person happened to have been enlisted in the Army twice, both times being put up for Court Martial for their resistance to authority. While hearing this person's story I could tell how their similar situations could draw them to a book like this. I haven't experienced any military time, but I wasn't happy by the portrayal of incompetence by the leaders in this book. I have a hard time believing that everyone in positions of authority in a military unit are either looking for advancement or public notoriety.
B000AP04MO|5.0|This smart, knowing romance projects director Donen's signature style, with Hepburn the essence of sixties chic, and Finney (in his prime) the epitome of a salty, rugged leading man. European locales and a memorable Henry Mancini score add the requisite zing to this mature, nuanced love story. William Daniels and Eleanor Bron are also memorable as another married couple who cause Joanna and Mark to examine the state of their own union.
0812589041|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time. An amazing look at gifted children and teaching techniques. An exciting and tactical look at war and military training. A thought provoking idea on the limiting of the World's population and how it could backfire. Look for all of the concepts in this book to be a part of our future as science fiction writers are often our crystal ball.
B0009HKH6Q|5.0|This sleek, stylized movie's chic trappings and star chemistry still comprise a winning formula. It's fun to see the usually scruffy McQueen dressed to the nines in the title role, but Dunaway's the revelation. Stacked up against the wily, macho Crown, Vicky is his match in looks, confidence, and brains, so the inevitable seduction feels balanced and mutual. \\"Crown\\" is a sexy, suspenseful cat-and-mouse game waged between equals, with a nifty surprise finish. Innovative split screen cinematography from Haskell Wexler and a romantic Michel Legrand soundtrack make this one of the top \\"sixties time capsule\\" films.
0440234743|4.0|Ok, so John Grisham continues to surprise me. My lack of interest in law junk is overcome by a well-written story. The characters are very believable and the whole concept is interesting to the bone. It is easy to see that Grisham is not the best of adventure writers as he puts the lead character into predictable circumstances. His return trip to the jungle was much more exciting and left me thinking why they didn't just do it that way the first time. I still give a thumbs up for a good book and great read.
B00008972S|5.0|Adapted by Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins from the long-running Broadway play, this triumphant production combines a brilliant score and jaw-dropping choreography with a heart-rending tale of doomed love. The leads work well together, with Wood particularly effective, but supporting players Russ Tamblyn (as Jet leader Riff), Chakiris and Rita Moreno (as Bernardo's sassy girlfriend Anita) virtually eclipse the stars with their intense moves and portrayals. This vibrant film is also elevated by an unsurpassed, evergreen Bernstein/Sondheim score. Winner of a staggering ten Oscars, including Best Picture.
0380002930|4.0|Watership Down is a classic book of journey, but that is not the best part of this book. The adventures these usually cowardly rabbits have are enjoyable and enthralling. Yet, it is the rabbit culture that makes this book so good. Few have perceived everyday animals as Adam's has shown us the simple rabbit. This book flows well and always leaves you wanting more. The only drawback is that it gives the reader little room for thought. Only a few places in the book does Adam's give us some sort of mystery, but they are small and often predictable. I loved the book and can't wait to read Tales from Watership Down.
B00009NHC5|5.0|Audrey Hepburn ventures into edgy territory in Terence Young's \\"Wait Until Dark,\\" based on the stage play by Frederick Knott (writer of \\"Dial M for Murder\\"). The Oscar-nominated actress excels in the role of a sightless woman fighting for her life in a basement New York flat, and Richard Crenna is solid as her unlikely protector. Still, it's Alan Arkin who really sets your teeth on edge playing one of the screen's creepiest villains. This nifty suspenser starts slowly but builds to a terrifying climax. Just wait.
158234082X|4.0|I never thought that one person could work in so many different restaurants. I found this book to be very informative about the difficulty of running a restaurant. Yet, I found Tony's life and his habits as a cook to be more interesting. It seems like it has taken him years to finally figure out his goal in life; to be as good a chef as possible. An enjoyable read that gives some insight to the enclosed world of the kitchen. Sometimes it is better to just not look in the kithcen, but sometimes curiosity kills a cat or two. This cat will shy away from muscles and dirty bathrooms.
B000PMGNK4|2.0|Ghost in the Shell's success has always been a bit of a fluke, as it was to be Appleseed that was Shirow's magnum opus.  I really wanted to like Solid State Society, I really did, but just found it to be very lacking.    The first season of Stand Alone was amazing, as it managed to capture some of the feel of the comic: counter terrorist ops fighting terrorists and drinkin a cold one afterwards.  Second season was passable, grasping at straws to develop characters meant to be nothing more than a talking head or plot device, plus the inclusion of a Mary Sue villain.    Still, I'd hoped that all the money that the GitS property has made studio IG over the years could've produced something better than what was essentially an almost two hour episode of Stand Alone with at most three minutes of amazing action animation.    Had they simply retold the classic Puppet Master story from the comic using the Stand Alone characters, it could've been a much better movie.  The further GitS breaks from the original source material (specifically the original comic run), generally the weaker it becomes.  I can't help but think that by borrowing more heavily from Man Machine Interface (particularly the whole rogue Motoko and Motoko's split consciousness bit), Solid State Society lost the potential to be an action packed thriller to wrap up the series in a hail of gun-fire and car chases.  It all felt rather unsatisfying.    After the unyieldingly convoluted, pandering, and nearly unreadable debacle that was Man Machine Interface, I hope, as a Shirow fan, that the Ghost in the Shell franchise can be laid to rest with some of its dignity in tact; a solemn procession that should not end with a 21 gun salute, but rather a crudely drawn Batou going colon \\"d\\" while firing a miniature shoulder mounted rocket into the air.
B000P0IW6E|3.0|I've been a fan since the Love at First Sting album was released over 20 years ago and ever since the Scorps have released solid albums. Some of them are perhaps a little underrated (Savage Amusement) and some have had been a little different (Eye II Eye). With the release of Unbreakable (another underrated album) I though the Scorps have returned with a vengeance. Unfortunately, with Humanity Hour-1 Im not sure I can say that. This album has a lot of slow songs that are really forgetable (in comparison to Holiday, Wind of Change or Still Loving you)some that are catchy, but the heavy edge of dueling guitars of Jabs and Schenker are almost non existent. In the past most of the music and lyrics have been composed and written by Klaus Meine and Rudolf Schenker, on this album the influence of Desmond Child and James Michael and several other contributors who are trying to make this album into pop 40 are confusing and the results are subpar. If anything this album really shows how great the \\"Unbreakable\\" was, even though some of the fans may disagree with me. While I'm disappointed with this release I will definitely see them in concert in southern cal...
B00005JPAO|5.0|I think the movie is fair and reasonably balanced. with the exception of Helen Mirren and James Cromwell the rest of the film is horribly mi-cast. I remember in 1997 during \\" that week \\"  wondering how the  British people could turn on the Queen given Diana's antics from 1993-1997. My heart really went out for her when she had to come back to Buckingham Palace and read the silly notes left on flowers by people. After all her years of service from the age of 15 fixing British army trucks during the blitz during WWII to the hard resconstruction years after the war, devoting herself 24 hrs a day to the British people , what was going through her mind as she faced those crowds that day and had to hear their applause for making her come down from Balmoral I can only guess.  I think what Tony Blair says about Diana & the Queen in this film was awesome, How could The Queen lead the world in mourning of a woman who threw everything she offered to her back in her face and in recent years has spent 24/7 trying to destroy all those things she holds dear ?.  I think Christopher Hitchens documentary  \\"Princess Diana: The Mourning After\\",  hit the nail  on the head. One thing I did not like about this movie was the way the Queen Mother was portrayed. Every Royal book written about her portrays her as 100% opposite the way this movie showed her. The producers of The Queen need to read some WWII history.
0316018953|3.0|Good read but too short.  The plot was clever, however, a little far fetched.  I'm not exactly sure why, but I knew the identity of the murderer almost immediately.  This was a fun and exciting read.  Taking into consideration the cost vs number of pages however, I would borrow it from the library.
B000OT6V00|4.0|I'm not a big Del Torro fan (Blade II, Pan's Labyrinth), and this movie leaves a little to be desired at times.  However, I bought this movie on Blu-ray because I knew it would be a feast for the eyes.  I still can't get over how beautiful Selma Blair's character looked consumed in blue flame.  Absolutely gorgeous.  The blu-ray format really allows this movie to shine visually.  Rasputin covered in blood is some of the richest, boldest reds I've seen in a movie.  All of the colors are so saturated that they practically jump off the screen.  Most of the images are not too grainy, which can be typical for HD transfers.  Generally, most images are crisp and clean.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong.  It's not all about the looks.  This movie has some great action and cool monsters.  It also has a nice dichotomy brewing within Hellboy in that he is spawn from hell but raised as a Christian (which should have been fleshed out more in the film).  Some of the fights with Samael (hound of hell) tend to drag on and on and get really repetitive.  Ron Perlman's sarcasm in between punches tends to help it along though.<br /><br />If you enjoy monster movies, comic book adaptations, or action films in general, you will most likely enjoy this one.  It's not the best, but you could do worse.
B00009V7T2|5.0|When At the Drive-In broke up, two bands came out of it, Sparta and The Mars Volta. I have a couple albums by Sparta. They're pretty solid if unexceptional hardcore/punk rock. Despite their more mainstream sound, they're overshadowed by their unique and more eccentric counterparts. There's been a bit of a backlash against The Mars Volta's increasingly weird and meandering music, as evidenced in declining critical acclaim, but if nothing else, De-Loused is a hard-rocking, original creation. They are known for very long tracks that have nothing but strange noises for minutes at a time, but their first full-length keeps that to a minimum as they focus on real music. The lyrics are strange and seemingly strings of random words thrown together, but there apparently is meaning, the whole thing being an obscure concept album about a character based on a friend of the band members who committed suicide after a drug-induced coma.    \\"Son et Lumiere\\" is an atmospheric intro that segues nicely into \\"Inertiatic ESP\\", the only song I've really heard before. It's fast-paced and shows the epitome of what the high-pitched vocalist can do for a song. There's a chaotic sound that permeates most of the songs, and makes it seem more urgent and maybe better than its true, objective quality. \\"Drunkship of Lanterns\\" shows off their more latin-influenced side which is just as interesting as the more progressive stuff. \\"Eria Tarka\\" has one of the more infectious vocal parts. \\"Cicatriz ESP\\" is the longest track and is the biggest hint of what's to come with the band, having an extensive section of jamming and ambience before coming back to finish the song. Flea's strong baseline pulls it forward to the explosive chorus. It's interesting how each song is sufficiently unique to be memorable while still always sharing the same interesting vision of what good rock sounds like. Of the eight real songs on the record, \\"Televators\\" is the least instantly entertaining, but is still a solid, slower song. \\"Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt\\" ends the album in one of the best ways I've ever heard, with an intense climax of starting and stopping guitars backing passionate vocals. It really makes you feel like you just finished listening to something great. It's a bit hard to define, but I think anyone with an inclination towards any of the aspects could like it.
1577314808|4.0|I find his book a great guidebook for learning to live in the present moment.  It's a necessary tool today if we want to stay grounded through the madness in our world.
B000QEILLK|3.0|The Flower Kings (Roine Stolt) take some of their shorter progressive rock tracks and re-mix and remaster them.  The chosen list is pretty good and covers their entire career up to this point.  The extra, never released track \\"Little Deceiver\\" from the Rainmaker sessions is nothing special.    The remixing doesn't seems to improve the songs much and actually seems to make them 'softer.'  I word I could use is 'pillowy'....almost giving some of the slower parts of songs a new-age feel to them (not a good thing in my opinion).  The punch of the original songs is missing, replaced by a broadening effect to fully take up the sonic range.  Another point of dissapontment......should you really mess with \\"Church of Your Heart?\\"  The classic Flower Kings song has been truncated and the dramatic key change at the last part of the original version is gone.  That was the part of the song that got me hooked on the song in the the first place.  Also \\"I am the Sun part II\\" seems to be truncated as well, and again, the best part of the song, in my opinion, is missing.    Songs picked from newer releases (Adam + Eve and Paradox Hotel) are less affected by the mixing and come off much like the originals.    All-in-all, this is a good collection of Flower King songs, but the remixing doesn't seem that great of an improvement of the originals.
B000002UE9|5.0|poison' open up and say...ahh! is a classic metal record.the songs nothin' but a good time,fallen angel,every rose has its thorn,and your mama don't dance all hit the top 20. other good songs were good love, bad to be good,love on the rocks,andyou can look but you can't touch. this is my favorite album by poison. i think you will like it too. ed wilson
B000AL730O|5.0|Someone once said that Paul McCartney conveys his feelings, not through lyrics but through his use of melody. No where is that more apparent than on this album. I bought this cd during the divorce scandal, so maybe my impression is colored by hindsight, but  the melodies and chord sequences on some of the songs are so sad, that it's almost hard to listen. Mind you I've been a fan for 37 years, and maybe this also colored my impression,but I can't listen to songs like 'Jenny Wren', 'Vanity Fair', and 'Friends to Go' without feeling a heavy, sadness. It doesn't matter what or who he's singing about,in fact the lyrics don't even matter. The melodies convey such sadness, that even on upbeat songs like, 'A Certain Softness', and 'English Tea', I still felt that heaviness. I get the same feeling when I listen to Paul's part of the long medly on Abbey Road,ie; 'You Never Give Me Your Money', 'Golden Slumbers',etc. This guy writes the sweetest melodies when he's going through s***. So I love this cd. Before I bought it, I hadn't owned a McCartney album since 'Band on the Run'. I had always been a Beatles fan, but after 'Band on the Run', (which I loved) I got away from Paul for many years because I just didn't like what he was doing anymore. 'Silly Love Songs?'.. yuk.. collaborations with Michael Jackson and Stevie Wonder?...oh come on, what is he doing?, I thought. I concentrated on punk and new wave, alternative, and 60's music (especially British), and of course I never stopped loving the Beatles. Fast forward to 2006, and it's all over the news that my favorite bass player is going through a nasty divorce. I found out that his latest album contains many songs about what he was going through, and I was intrigued, so I bought it. On first listen, I didn't like it, and incidentally a lot of the reviewers who gave it less than 4 stars probably wrote their reviews after only one listen. But the second time I put it on, I was blind sided. Some cynical people who still live in the land of 'Silly Love Songs' and think that McCartney lost it after he lost the Beatles (I was one of those people),will not agree with what I'm about to say but I'll say it anyway...This cd contains some of the most beautiful music he's done in years and some of it is as good as anything he did in the Beatles. 'Jenny Wren' could have easily fit on the White Album, Abbey Road or even Revolver. It's just as good as Eleanor Rigby (ouch, can't believe I'm saying that). 'A Certain Softness' is as romantic and sexy as 'Here There and Everywhere', and that too would have fit nicely on Revolver. You really feel how much he loves the two women he's singing about, but he also seems to be singing about loss, which lends a sadness to this wonderful song. Critics have written off 'English Tea', saying it's trite, and one of the weaker songs. I guess they don't get the ironic humor of it, and they missed the gorgeous melody too...oh well their loss...don't listen to them. If 'English Tea' had been on the White Album, it would have stood up well to 'Martha My Dear'. Some people say 'Friends to Go' is about George Harrison. Did Paul actually say this? Whether he did or not, it does seem to be about a relationship that has been strained, and the author wants to make things right...(before it's too late?) 'Riding to Vanity Fair' is the most foreboding, bitter song I've ever heard from McCartney. Of course the \\"Vanity Fair\\" analogy seems to suggest it's about Ms. Mills-McCartney, and actually that's a pretty obvious metaphor. Who else could he possibly be singing about? Another reviewer said that it's about his daughter Heather, but I don't think that's right. I did an advance Google search of Heather Louise McCartney and a possible Vanity Fair article and nothing came up. But everyone remembers Heather Mills' Vanity Fair interview from 2002.       After buying this album, I came back to McCartney. I bought 'Driving Rain','Flowers in the Dirt','Ram' 'McCartney', a cd replacement of 'Band on the Run', and some of his live albums. I even bought his classical cd, 'Ecc Cor Meum'. I love all of them, and I can't believe what I was missing all these years. With 'Chaos and Creation' the great pop melodist is back. You will love this album. Even the cover photo is brilliant. A class act.
B000OPOANE|2.0|High-res 2-channel and 5.1 DD. That's not a typo.  They couldn't even bother with full-bitrate DTS.    I'll leave it at that.
B000R7GKQE|5.0|Supernatural is one of the best shows on t.v right now!  excellent plot, extremely realistic, awesome acting.  If you are a sci-fi fan you should buy it! If you're not  you should buy it to
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I picked up the album as soon as it was out, and expected to immediately 'dig' the sounds on it. Well, 'Sick,sick,sick' was an indication of what to expect. That's an instantly catchy tune... the rest of the album may not necessarily be so... but thats not a bad thing. This is a very decent album. Better than 'Lullabies...'. After about 3 weeks, i'm pretty hooked on most of the tracks. In my opinion, 9 of the 12 songs are really good. Tracks 1,2,3,4,7,8,9,11,12. Great stuff, nicely mixed up in terms of sound, tempo, feel. The album should not be judged after a couple of listens... give it awhile, you'd be surprised at how good and different it sounds. Kudos to QOTSA for mixing it up. I am disappointed however that the album peaked and debuted at only No. 14 on the US billboard charts... it certainly deserved a top 10 spot.
B0008JFMEC|4.0|\\"Kill Bill\\" was either a disaster-in-the-making or a one of a kind hit -- a sprawling revenge flick that had to be cut in two and released separately. But director Quentin Tarantino serves up entertainingly mindless gore and twisted thrills in \\"Kill Bill Volume 1,\\" a salute to homages.<br /><br />Tragedy strikes the Bride (Uma Thurman) on her wedding day: The Deadly Viper Assassination Squad (DiVAS) attacks and slaughters the guests, the groom, and wounds the very pregnant Bride herself. Her former boss/lover Bill (David Carradine) finishes the bloodbath by shooting the Bride in the head. But despite his efforts, she isn't dead.<br /><br />A few years later, the Bride wakes to find that she has been in a coma for a few years, and has been being used as a sex toy for rent. After recovering enough to move, the Bride gets a sword sharp enough to \\"cut God,\\" and goes on a revenge spree against the people who wrecked her life and killed her baby, including Cottonmouth (Vivica A. Fox) and the deadly O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu).<br /><br />Don't expect cinematic art in \\"Kill Bill Volume 1.\\" If anything, this is cinematic pop art, a loving tribute to cheesy martial-arts flicks and westerns. Tarantino even inserts a stretch of anime detailing O-Ren's background. It's pure Tarantino, untainted by typical directing methods and immensely entertaining if you switch off your critical faculties, refrain from asking \\"How the heck could that happen?\\"<br /><br />\\"Kill Bill\\" isn't for the weak of stomach; over 450 gallons of fake blood are used in both movies. But the blood usage is more \\"Monty Python\\" than \\"Braveheart\\"; it's so over-the-top that it's silly and sick rather than disturbing. So is the violence -- hacking dozens of people down without getting so much as a scrape is impossible, but it's sure fun to watch.<br /><br />Tarantino throws out more one-liners than just about any other filmmaker around. The absurd \\"Trix is for kids\\" line aside, there are a number of great lines like \\"Those of you lucky enough to have your lives take them with you. However, leave the limbs you've lost. They belong to me now.\\" The script teems with impossibilities, but they seem plausible enough in this alternate reality that Tarantino has cooked up. Call it Tarantinoland.<br /><br />Uma Thurman, with her yellow tracksuit and katana, rules the screen as the Bride. Despite the Bride cutting down people by the dozen, it's impossible not to appreciate her. And the best supporting performances come from Liu as the ruthless O-Ren, Carradine in a brief but intense appearance, and the wonderful, underrated Chiaki Kuriyama as evil schoolgirl Go-Go Yubari.<br /><br />It's silly, it's creepy, it's gaudy, and somehow it's vastly entertaining.

B000000OYQ|4.0|When the world appears to be totally messed up, the tough turn on, drop out and tune in to music. Now it sure don't bother me none what gets ya through the night, and it don't make a lot a diff'rence as to what grooves ya, but the blues sure grooves me at times like this. So when I went rummaging through the bargain bin at my local used record store a few weeks ago and found \\"Outrider\\" by Jimmy Page for less that a pint of Jack Daniels, I scarfed it up right away. After stripping the shrink wrap off and plopping the shiny metal disc into my mobile cd changer, I cranked it to five (but what's numbers...it was way loud, dig)?     What I heard is simply the best 40 minutes of blues drenched heavy rock that's gotten my attention in a long time. This record never received much airplay when it was released back in September 1988, because there were a slew of Zeppelin imitators that had gotten onto the radio first. So when the real thing arrived in the form of a Jimmy Page solo album, with special guests Jason Bonham and Robert Plant, the radio folks said, nah, it's not commercial enough. The record charted and then fell like an iron dirgible, or something like that. The result was that the record has and continues to languish in bargain bins all over the Western Hemisphere. But give credit to the wonderful folks at Geffen who released it in the first place and who are now doing us a favor, by cutting the price to, \\"rock bottom\\" to get the, er \\"lead\\" out of their inventory, so to speak.     I had heard some of the record 18 years ago on cassette, but it didn't hit me how good it is until now. Most of the old Zep themes are revisited including wasting time, makin' love, and yes a song entitled \\"Prison Blues\\" (How ironic in light of recent world events involving blonde wannabe celebrities, eh). If you want guitar riffs that totally cut AC/DC, Jimmy Page was the man and on this album he really outdid himself reworking riffs and ideas he carved into rock riff legend on 'Led Zeppelin I' and 'In Through the Out Door'. Sadly, no music this good has been released by Jimmy since, in my humble opinion.     So trip out on this one and be sure to turn it up to really annoy your landlord or your passengers on your way to Chicago, or heaven or Kashmir.
0140277447|4.0|Iris Chang has close personal ties to the Nanking Massacre - her parents narrowly escaped the orgy of violence that ensued in 1938 - 1939.  This raises questions of objectivity, which Chang clearly struggles with, hence the four stars.  However, the book is well-researched and credible sources are cited - a necessary point given the accusations made.<br /><br />Chang begins with a brief history of modern (since the Meji restoration) Japanese history, seeking to provide some explaination for the barbarity that happened in China during the Japanese occupation.  This provides some critical background information before the catalogue of atrocities are presented in gruesome detail: gang rapes, the desecration of corpses, torture - the savagery and brutality of which appalled me.  The primary sources used in researching this are irrefutable to the serious historian.<br /><br />Chang then goes on to talk about the aftermath of the \\"Rape of Nanking\\" begining with the International Military Tribunal for the Far East (the \\"Asian Nuremburg\\" trial) concluding with an excellent analysis of why so few were punished and what the long-term consequences of not addressing the larger issue of Japanese war crimes are, especially in light of her claim that what happened in Nanking was deliberate Japanese policy; in fact, she goes on to write that the Nanking massacre was \\"a metaphor for Japanese behaviour during the war.\\"  The book concludes exploring why the Holocaust in Europe is much more familar than the atrocities committed in Asia.<br /><br />To some Japanese, Chang's claims are exaggerations or fabrications.  (See Tanaka Maasaki's \\"What Really Happened in Nanking\\" for this perspective.)  The historical record, however, clearly supports Chang's account.  What struck me most deeply, however, was the similarity between the accounts of 1938 China and Yugoslavia in the 1990's, particularly the contest over whose story is told (and which history is written) and who is punished.  There are lessons to be learned here larger than a single event.  Recommended reading for armchair historians.d here larger than a single event.  Recommended reading for armchair historians.
1596912855|2.0|The premise was excellent, and I was so excited to finally read the book! Sadly, it seemed more like a rough draft. The characters seemed very poorly developed and the story was a disappointment to me. I've read another book by this author that was excellent, so I wasn't expecting this mish mash of Jane Austen plots with a Bridget Jones ending.
B000E41MS6|4.0|I passionately hated Dr. Who when I was a kid growing up in the mid-80's.  I just didn't understand why anyone would like it.  Couldn't even stand to listen to the theme music 'cause it freaked me out so badly!  I've never been a huge fan of science fiction either.  (Harry Potter books are one of only a very few exceptions to this rule.)        However, when my local PBS station (which I LOVE) started airing episodes from this new series, I figured I'd give it another try.  SO worth it!  The writing, acting, special effects, directing...EVERYTHING about it is excellent, and it's such an intelligent, thought-provoking show which makes you feel so many different emotions!      If one episode alone could completely change my opinion, how much do you think YOU would enjoy it?  :-)      Yes, I'm an adult now and can tolerate scary TV much better than I used to, but I will admit that sections of some episodes still frighten me.  (Great episode, but \\"Empty Child\\" sent shivers down my spine every time I heard this little voice call out, \\"Mummy.  Mummy.  Are you my mummy?\\")  I like to watch this series with all the lights on and the dog curled up with me.  Each episode sticks with me, and I always hope that it won't give me nightmares!
B00004T9VY|5.0|If I had to choose one of Cat Stevens' albums, this would be it.  I prefer the mostly acoustic, piano and percussion emphasis in this one.  Whereas some of his later musical ventures lacked the depth of character and sound space that these songs provided to listeners.  I first hear Cat Steven's voice as the soundtrack to the film Harold and Maude - one of my all-time favorites.  Once I heard his voice, I was hooked.  I looked for a soundtrack, but at the time it was not available,.  Now I think there is one out.  The songs from that film are still my favorite of his works.  Amongst them, Wild World stands out.  My favorite songs from [[ASIN:6305882592 Harold and Maude]]are If you want to Sing Out, Sing Out, and Trouble, which can now be found on the soundtrack to the film.  Does anyone know where to get a copy of the soundtrack these days?  If not, pick up Tea for the Tillerman and one of his greatest hits CDs.
1594489505|5.0|This is a rare occurance. Two major book hits in a row. Normally, anything that follows the magnitude of a novel like \\"The Kite Runner\\" never lives up to the quality and excellence of a fine story. However, Hosseini goes way beyond \\"The Kite Runner\\" with a fascinating and bittersweet look at the mysterious lives of Afghan women.   This book kept me from first page to last as we went through thirty years of the lives of two socially polarized Afghan women. Once their two lives met, it became a rare, yet tragic bond. The characters are unforgettable as is the writing.  Can't wait for his next one!
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|I have seen this film many times and now I have watched the extended edition. This is one of those rare exceptions when a extended edition is welcome! The added scenes are not just garbage that should have never left the cutting room floor,but helpful scenes that answer many question I had in the original cut of the film. This is a worthy purchase because you get both version on this set,plus some interesting extras! The transfer is excellent!
B00005JPHT|4.0|I had written off michael moore after his last 9/11 movie as nothing more than a corporate and/or government proxy used to present information that deflects the left from more damaging information that was presented in other films such as '9/11 In Plane Site'.<br />But I have to give credit to this film.  Even though it is not fair on being comprehensive on the facts and tends to use the best examples of socialized medicine in the world, while ignoring the worst examples (such as Russia), it does point out the inefficiencies and corruption within the insurance industry, and possibly the pharmaceudical industry.  I don't see him also accurately giving credence to some information that points out that insurance companies were the ones that help co-wrote  and sponsor the bill that Hillary Clinton tried to pass through.  Does that mean he has an agenda, didn't point out that information for whatever purpose, or did not know about it?<br />One thing is for sure, Michael Moore is an intelligent individual who knows how to play people's emotions whether for profit or for something good in society.  Perhaps he has turned over a new leaf.  And it could be argued that a truely unbiased film probably would not be as entertaining, nor would serve as well the purpose of pointing out the problems in our own system.<br />The only possible deflection that might could be present here is the exclusion of alternative health remedies out on the market.  Perhaps this was done for practical reasons (to cover his own you know what).  But it is a sad case when some alternative medicine has been heavily regulated to the point of either being censored or only available for \\"research\\" purposes - when they are also potentially a major point if we are ever going to fix the problem.  And problem is that there is huge money to be made by not curing health problems.  But by either treating symptoms or by making new syndromes (in other words, treating the symptoms and pretending that the symptoms are the diseases instead of actually treating the cause of the disease as the disease and treating that)<br />America is corrupt - all the way from the top to the middle, and possibly the bottom as well.

B00004Y87O|4.0|I bought the single disc special edition and found that it has the same transfer as the new 2 disc special edtion. I found this out through another reviewer on this movie. The older 1 disc version stated surround sound on the back of the package the newer one states 5.1. along with some other add ons such a French mono dubbed track amd the reviewer quote \\"Dark and dangerous\\" has been replaced with \\"Riviting\\". If you want a nice print of the movie you can buy the single disc for around $5.00 or pay $25.00 for some extras and commentary. This movie is an early example of Carpenter's music and style. The Thing was released after this movie and is a superior film.
1594481784|3.0|High Fidelity is the third Nick Hornby book I've read. And like About a Boy and A Long Way Down, it features a lot of the insightful, often funny navel-gazing I've found appealing in Hornby's other books. In this case, we get to listen in on the thoughts of Rob, a sort of neurotic, disconnected thirtysomething who's just broken up with his fifth or sixth girlfriend. He's vaguely reminiscent of the Will Lightman character from About a Boy. He can't maintain stable relationships and has obsessions with things that interfere greatly with his social life. My main gripe with this book though is that his observations rarely seem to show some sort of growth or progression of character. Only after a particular, tragic event, late into the novel, do we finally begin to see a different Rob, one who begins to realize that he's got his priorities all mixed up and begins to take responsibility for more important things. It's a refreshing change of pace after a lot of the confused, sad self-centered ramblings, funny and dead-on as some of them may be. It's hard to be too critical of this lack of drive in the novel, because Hornby obviously wanted to develop a fully realized character in Rob, which I feel he has done successfully. It sometimes, however, makes for a tiring read, especially when one can't always rely on the pop culture references for laughter or knowing amusement. (I got like maybe half of them!) More interaction with some of the supporting characters would've been nice too--especially Barry, Rob's co-worker at the record shop, who's even more socially inept and out of touch, and Marie, an underground country singer who Rob has a one night fling with. An enjoyable, readable book about a pretty unsympathetic guy--that's sort of an accomplishment in of itself, but I can't say I'm as enthusiastic of the book overall as the majority of reviewers.
0061122416|5.0|THE ALCHEMIST is a beautiful allegory about following your dreams through the journey of Santiago as a poor boy who dreams of traveling the world. His father buys him sheep to tend in order to give him a livelihood. Still Santiago continues to vividly see a boy in his dream showing him a mysterious treasure in Egypt. His dream in time becomes reality as Santiago finds himself among the pyramids of Egypt with an Englishman knowledgeable about alchemists.    This book is reminiscient of children's tale called THE LITTLE PRINCE. \\"The Alchemist\\" has a child-like feel still it's message is spiritually powerful.    I've recently read another book called NEXUS: A NEO NOVEL, which also prominently features the importance of following your dreams. In that book, Logan is led to a spiritual retreat where he learns to overcome his doubts and manifest his dreams. It's a contemporary book similar to THE ALCHEMIST about love and compassion.
0393061434|3.0|Steve Wozniak gives us his perspective on the founding of Apple, with lots of entertaining stories about the early days when he and Steve Jobs were experimenting with hardware design using the then-new microprocessors. Woz confirms that he bought two 6502 processors from Chuck Peddle of MOS Technologies for $20 apiece at a computer show and it was these that he used to create the first Apple. Peddle recently gave a talk to a group of retro computer enthusiasts and said he had a barrel of microprocessors at that show, but he'd had quality control problems and only the ones on top actually worked. Good thing Woz got two that worked!<br /><br />Woz says he built his first computer, the Apple I, to show off at the Homebrew Computer Club (which he credits with starting the computer revolution) and made the design freely available. He was not thinking about how these designs could become a product that would eventually be a big business. He was just hoping other people would enjoy his design and build their own computer. Steve Jobs was looking to sell the design to a company that might turn it into a product. It was Jobs who got that first order from Paul Terrell, who ordered 100 of them to sell at his Byte Shop. But Woz takes credit for inventing personal computing (the subhed for the book is \\"How I invented the personal computer...\\") He did design the products that made Apple a success, but even the Apple had other contributors. Chuck Peddle was the designer of the 6502 that powered the Apple. Wouldn't he deserve a bit of credit for his contribution to personal computing?<br /><br />In 1977 when the Apple II hit the marketplace, there were two other microcomputers that also went on sale, and, like Woz' Apple, they also had keyboards, rather than the front switches that were the input method of the Altair. One was the Commodore PET, designed by the same Chuck Peddle. This was an all-in-one case model with a cassette tape player for storage and a tiny built-in monitor. The other was the microcomputer that Bill Gates was later quoted as saying \\"set the market on fire...\\". It was the Radio Shack TRS-80. The Model I TRS-80 came with everything you needed, including a monitor. Woz makes it sound like the lack of a monitor for the Apple was a feature, rather than a drawback, by saying how you could connect it to your own TV set. He erroneously states that only the Apple was built for expansion. It's true that the Apple had expansion slots, but the TRS-80 was also designed for expansion; it used a second piece of hardware users had to buy called an \\"expansion interface\\" that let you add more memory and connect a disk drive. The TRS-80 was launched in August 1977 with modest expectations, but it was an immediate success and the company found itself swamped with orders. The TRS-80 had the advantage of being sold through 3500 Radio Shack stores nationwide. It had much more potential for reaching buyers than Apple, which was just a small start-up company.  People could go to a store and actually see a TRS-80 and try their hand at typing commands, using the excellent manual that came with it. For a personal perspective on the creation and  impact of the TRS-80, read my book, Priming the Pump: How TRS-80 Enthusiasts Helped Spark the PC Revolution.<br /><br />Ok, so Steve Wozniak does have a lot of accomplishments to brag about -- his designs for the Apple I and Apple II were brilliant -- but great hardware design does not make a revolution. It also takes software and it takes the vision to see what these products could do and what they could mean to ordinary people. Woz admits that VisiCalc, the \\"killer app\\" that provided a reason for many people to purchase a microcomputer, took him by surprise. While he was looking for a computer that could play games and do fun stuff, other people wanted a computer for its ability to transform the way they did business and VisiCalc, the world's first electronic spreadsheet, gave small business the computingpower they sought. Over the years, computers have filled all kinds of niches, including many that the early designers could not foresee.<br /><br />This book constantly uses the words \\"amazing,\\" \\"weird\\" and \\"engineer\\" as Woz presents himself as the quintessential engineer who came up with amazing hardware designs for weird uses (like stealing phone services). He tells us about the famous pranks he pulled, operating a Dial-a-Joke service, and the whole \\"phone phreak\\" culture, including his search for the infamous Captain Crunch. The book is at its best when Woz is writing about these years, but he is more circumspect about the later period at Apple. We get only hints at his real relationship with Steve Jobs during the time Apple was moving away from Apple II and working on the Macintosh. His information is so sketchy that it likely will not dispel continued speculation that he and Jobs had a falling out.<br /><br />While I do not agree with Woz' assessment of himself as the inventor of personal computing, I do agree with much of his advice in the last chapter. He tells young people to work alone on their original ideas, and persist if they believe in what they are doing. As a refugee from the corporate world, it is my humble opinion that nothing great is invented by committees and that working in teams is vastly overvalued. I too believe that every really important invention or insight into how to do things better comes from one person. Woz tells us that he and he alone built the first Apple, and I also know from personal experience as an early software seller (for the TRS-80) that the early software that fueled the computer revolution was almost always the work of one programmer. Many self-taught programmers brought about the PC revolution with their creative insight and incredible skill at building real applications in tiny amounts of memory and slow storage devices. Microcomputer pioneers, all of them, even if they are not famous.<br /><br />Computers are now everywhere, in so many products and used for so many purposes that they have become invisible, taken for granted. While one person can have fantastic accomplishments (like designing a great computer or a great software application), no one person could accomplish something as transforming as personal computing has been on modern society.

0316067598|5.0|Like some of you, I could not put this book down and finished it in less than a day.  I've been reading novels and non-fiction for 25 years and I've never finished a book in a day.      I'm sorry to see that some people have a problem with Luttrell's ripping of the ROE (Rules of Engagement) and his outspoken opinion of the American media and Democratic party.  Well, despising Democrats and the media goes hand in hand with serving in the military, unfortunately.  My future father in law is a SEAL and served under Clinton's administration.  On a visit to Coronado, Clinton couldn't get any SEALs to go with him one morning on his daily jog until an officer stepped in and appointed someone to go on the run with Bill.  True story.    Lone Survivor should be recognized for the work that it is, the sacrifices of Murhpy, Axelson, Dietz, and Luttrell and all of our fellow Americans.  The fact that Marcus is pissed at liberals is fine with me.  The guy has paid for the right to criticize ignorance and stupidity.  Just read the book and pay homage to an unbelievable warrior and his team of SEALs.
0765348276|4.0|Having read and enjoyed Starship Troopers a long time ago, I found \\"Old Man's War\\" to be a great fast read in the same spirit. I think Scalzi set out to produce a novel for fans of Heinlein, and didn't disappoint. The choice of volunteering of military life, as opposed to being born and bred for it, is a central theme of this novel and will hopefully be explored in its sequels.     It's great that this novel has garnered so much attention - I don't think it's particularly controversial, and the most legitimate criticisms seems to be the rather shallow (or perhaps too familiar) drill instructor, and the difficulty in resolving 75 years of life experience (the protagonist is that old when he signs up) with being a green infantry soldier.  I agree with these criticisms, but it demonstrates that Scalzi did not pick any easy story to tell - neither did Heinlein in \\"Starship Troopers\\" or Haldeman in \\"The Forever War.\\"     I give this novel 3.5 stars, rounded up to 4 since so many on Amazon who bought this book have enjoyed it.
0316018953|5.0|I kept this novel for a vacation-poolside read and am glad I did. What a smooth read. It is the kind of active, entrancing novel that maintains the reader's focus without putting up needless roadblocks. I guess I have read most of the Harry Bosch series and followed him through his trials with the authorities in police administration, other police agencies, and his personal relationships as he untangles complex murders. Like many of the contemporary thriller writers, Connelly has run into the problem of his Vietnam era hero reaching an age that stretches disbelief in some physical activity. Like Hillerman he has found a solution, perhaps even more elegant than Hillerman's mentoring of Chee by Leaphorn: Bosch retires, then returns as the cold case/ complex case specialist. In the previous novel, an old nemesis returned, in this instance a high profile murder, one with the potential to use up endless hours of standard detective work while producing little result - an apparent execution slaying - is revealed as something else. It seems to be a terrorist plot to develop a dirty bomb. But difficulties arise. Things do not quite mesh.    Those of us familiar with this series wait to see what the \\"overlooked\\" item is. Connelly likes his puns, and there is certainly one here. I guess it could be called the\\"don't count your chickens until they are hatched truth.\\" What are the most common reasons for murder? Yup. Where should the detective always look for the murderer? Yup.It unfolds with the practiced skill of a master storyteller. Time and treasure well spent, glad I read it.     By the way, even though this is a continuing character in a series, it really is essentially a rebirth and makes a good place for a newly arrived reader to meet and appreciate Harry Bosch.
B000OVLBFS|5.0|I recently got to watch Night Passage on TV and truly enjoyed it. It has a simple yet interesting detective storyline and nice strong characters (Selleck is perfect in the Stone's role, believably flawed as a womanizing drunk), and an allover simple \\"classic\\" timeless feel to it in the style of many British TV miniseries or films  - and that's a real compliment! (since I believe the British are the best at producing quality work for television.)   Well done!
B000B8QF14|4.0|On the 'Bullet in a Bible' DVD, Billie Joe Armstrong says that some bands worry about how they would create intimacy in front of a crowd of 65,000, but said that for Green Day it was irrelevant as they weren't trying to create intimacy, they were trying to create an event. Ultimately that's what 'Bullet in a Bible' is, an event, a fantastic spectacle.    The band open with a spine tingling version of their newer hits with 'American Idiot' and 'Holiday' leading the line. They also show how well 'Jesus of Suburbia' works when performed live. After these songs, Green Day bring their newer, more uninitiated fans through some of the earlier Green Day catalogue, with quality performances of, among other songs, 'Longview', 'Basket Case' and 'Minority'. These performances should give an electrified jolt to all Green Day fans, new and old.    During the encore, Billy Joe brings the only moment of the before eschewed intimacy to the concert, with his closing rendition of 'Good Riddance'. This brings a beautiful close to another fantastic show by the boys from California.
078401213X|2.0|If you are not into movie making or into the exciting world of mathematics don't even bother to watch this movie. Actually i found the making more interesting than the movie. The movie gives you severe headache and most probably that was intended for. I like low budget cult movies but this is not among them. You can feel the \\"movie making 101\\" everywhere in this movie. But I can tell its a treat for people who are fond of movies and their skeleton. If you don't care about behind the scene and only interested in a good, eye pleasing and entertaining movie this is not for you. My head still hurts thinking about Pi.
B000GRUS22|4.0|1st album of Enigma was a masterpiece. Second was not as good, but great. The rest were not worth listening to (in my opinion). After about 15 years of producing, frankly, junk Cretu is back with a new album I enjoy and listen to a lot. It is not the classic Enigma - this horse has been beaten to death already - but rather a new, more electronic direction with some Enigma sounds and hints. I think this is the right direction for Cretu - there simply will never be another \\"MCMXC A.D.\\". This album proves that he does not need another \\"MCMXC A.D.\\" to give his fans wonderful music to listen to. Cretu should go and explore new worlds - we all know he can!

I was thinking \\"another Meryl Streep's melodrama\\"; but this crazy movie tickled my brain and belly through out the play time. This is one of a kind movie with great star cast and they all are very very funny. Buy yourself a copy because you will never get tired of this movie.
B00005JPM0|4.0|Director Paul Verhoeven returns to his native Holland after more than 20 years (his last film there was 1983's The Fourth Man) and the result is a cinematic treat, probably his best film since Robocop. Both outrageous and exhilarating, Black Book tells the story of a Jewish singer (the excellent Carice Van Houten) and her improbable travails in occupied Holland during World War II. After spending a great part of the occupation hidden by some anti-Semitic farmers, her hiding place is bombed by the British towards the end of the war. She decides it's time to reunite with her family and escape with the help of some dubious people to allied-liberated Belgium. But there is an obvious betrayal during the escape and her whole family (along with other refugees) are killed by the Germans (she escapes miraculously by jumping into the water,007-style). After that, she joins the resistance, and a series of improbable situations occurs. When the son of one of the resistance leader is arrested, she is encouraged to seduce the German SS bigwig (whom she had met earlier on a train) so as to install a microphone inside the Nazi headquarters and help the resistance liberate the young man (the idea of a Jew becoming a lover of a high Nazi officer is, of course, highly offensive to many; the Nazi, by the way, is played by the fine actor who was the playwright in The Lives of Others). Many improbable things happen after wards, with incredible turns of events to the story happening at about every ten minutes, punctuated by deadly shootings between the Nazis and the Dutch resistance. The movie is 2hours and 25 minutes long, probably half an hour too much (it should have ended when Holland is liberated and she receives a less than stellar reception). It's impossible to take the movie very seriously (the movie claims to be based in true events, but this is almost certainly not true), but is extremely entertaining, and it shows Verhoeven at the top of his game.
B000OPOANE|4.0|For the MVI DVD, it's difficult for me to give the points of description since I don't count myself very techy, so this might be for the ordinary non-techs.<br /><br />The reason I gave it four out of five was for the fact it took so long to get it.  I'd pre-ordered it from Rush's website, but the DVD underwent different versions that I didn't truly get to hear some of the songs until they performed in Charlotte.  Such is sort of something asked for, given it's a new format.  The other side that could be a negative is the unused features, but the details about it was pretty obvious, so it can't be faulted.<br /><br />Per the features, this seems largely to be a response to people going more digital with their music, and this is a good alternative for folks who don't really listen to physical CD's anymore.  Songs were all ready to be saved on the computer at 196kbs MP3s, which I listened to from laptop speakers to my Sennheiser headphones to the small earphones to my MP3 player (SanDisk Sansa), and the sound quality retained a full, crisp sound to it.  Such could also be programmed to ringtones, though I don't own a phone for that.<br /><br />The video documentary of the recording of \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is probably what I enjoyed a little bit more.  It was about 45 minutes long, and presented specific interviewed segments about the story of the album in general, and stories behind a few songs in particular.  It was nice because, although some of the things expressed echo \\"The Game of Snakes and Arrows\\" Peart writes (also included in electronic form on the MVI DVD), it simply felt more personalized.  Given the more personal views of the band being expressed on religion in light of current events, that was also helpful in case anybody is left feeling uneasy about Rush doing \\"a religion album.\\"  It seemed like the guys really enjoyed making this album, and it definitely showed when I saw them in concert.<br /><br />Other features include accommodations to the electronic mindset, having the booklet, lyrics, photographs from the recording/promotions, wallpapers, and even a poster among the additional things included electronically on the disc.  Again, even though the booklet and its lyrics are included in hard-copy with the MVI DVD case (which doesn't fit in conventional CD case holders), this is a move towards a more soft-copy approach.<br /><br />Whether Rush makes the things available on their MVI DVD also on the band website may or may not undermine the exclusivity of the MVI DVD (and the price and wait time for it), so it's a matter of waiting to see how they handle the features in the future.  Myself, despite the wait, I'm glad for it.  I've already put the disc away, as it's on my computer, in my MP3 player, and recorded on a CD-RW (and CD-R soon; my car CD player is older).<br /><br />Aside about \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" musically:<br />Apart from technology, I'll just say some things about the album itself.  I think there will always be those groups who prefer specific points in Rush's career over others (70s vs. 80s vs. 90s vs. 00s), and the album itself has already been categorized as a throw back to older times.  However, that can be a bit deceptive if one only likes a specific time in Rush's career, which can be murky now that you can almost say \\"a throw back to WHEN?\\"  In a way, that's true for the 70s:  you hear Alex play on \\"Far Cry\\" the trademark guitar chord from Hemispheres from \\"Cygnus\\" (I'm a bassist so the actual chord eludes me; Alex notes it on the MVI DVD); Alex also plays a distorted guitar part during \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" that is strongly reminiscent to a distorted effect on \\"The Necromancer\\" (I think it's that song) from Caress of Steel; songs like \\"Workin' Them Angels,\\" \\"The Way the Wind Blows,\\" and even \\"The Larger Bowl\\" (taking a slightly folksy, retrospective note) have more classic rock elements to it; Geddy plays his mellotron on \\"The Good News First\\" (presented on the MVI DVD); and Alex echos \\"Broon's Bane\\" from Exit Stage Left with \\"Hope,\\" though that can only be said because it's a solo acoustic instrumental.<br /><br />Past the echos there, Rush can almost be said to have redefined even themselves here, as they've also brought into the tightness they've developed over the now 30 years together.  It's not an album to try and hear their sound from a particular point in their career, but it remains a continuation.  Neil's drumming continues to be tastefully polyrhythmic and technical while maintaining musicality; Alex remains strong with his guitar playing, mastering new and old to add to the melody of songs; and Geddy remains strong vocally and on the bass, even to taking on experiments with a fretless Fender Custom Shop Jaco Pastorius model in \\"Malignant Narcissism\\" (also on the MVI DVD; I also need to say that I personally like the way his singing voice has gotten warmer come the 90s onward; has a nice resonance to it, especially on \\"The Larger Bowl\\").  For those who've tracked their development over the years, this isn't anything startlingly new.  They've not remained static musically, perhaps ever.<br /><br />With the lyrics, I'll leave it plain because I like what initial and repeated listenings reveal, but it's definitely an album exploring issues of religion/faith/values.  Peart has been honest about his views in the past, and this is unique in it's being the focus for them.  With my being someone who believes in and walks with Jesus, this was an album I'd been wanting for awhile.  The antagonism, pointedness often present with fanatical segments of major religions is what typifies religions in general nowadays.  I was happy to hear Peart articulate his concerns.  My only hope is people are able to distinguish between fanatical majority between actual beliefs.  Such is maybe the question I would have for Peart:  what about the non-violent, armorless and swordless faithful remnant?  Wait and see/hear/read, perhaps.  Either way, I remain a fan.\\"Hope,\\" though that can only be said because it's a solo acoustic instrumental.

B000Q6GUTI|5.0|SHOOTER (DVD).<br /><br />Shooter is based upon the novel Point of Impact by Stephen Hunter.  I enjoyed the novel some years ago; I enjoyed the movie last night.<br /><br />Gunnery sergeant Bob Lee Swagger( Mark Wahlberrg) is a sniper.  He's been recruited by Spooks to a special mission that only he is good enough to do.  He gathers up his trusty .50 caliber Barrett sniper rifle and takes a couple of practice shots, then agrees to do the mission.  Of course since Spooks are involved he is set up for something that he didn't do, Spooks are notorious for weaving a web of deception and double crossing.<br /><br />The  movie follows Swagger across the country making one outrageous shot after another.  In the end Swagger pulls off a twist, gets the girl and saves the day.  All in all a very satisfying movie.<br /><br />Gunner  July, 2007
B00000JNJ1|1.0|I can't even begin to say how bad this compilation is. Just another piece of evidence against any rock and roll post 1971 or 2. If this is what gave Rod Steward \\"credibility\\" then he can go to hell. That's my opinion.
B0000DJZA5|4.0|A lot of people don't want history messed with, but I, for one am glad that this has come out.  I bought the original album in the 70's and as a Beatles fan was very disappointed.  It just didn't sound like them to me. I replaced all my Beatles albums on CD when the time came--except for this one.  You know from other reviewers the tale of this album's creation, but let me say that this is probably the closest we will get to hearing these songs as they might have sounded if The Beatles had stayed together long enough to actually finish this project. This sounds, to my ears, much more like the Beatles.  The greatly improved sound quality is reason enough to buy this cd. I don't miss \\"Maggie Mae\\" or \\"Dig it\\" which were nothing but useless filler.  All the banter being gone, makes it a much more polished album. Including \\"Don't let Me Down\\" makes perfect sense, since it is in the film, backs the \\"Get Back\\" single and strengthens the collection of songs. I can't imagine why it wasn't there in the first place.     A minor complaint would be that it would have been nice to have a few bonus songs such as \\"The Ballad of John and Yoko\\", \\"Old Brown Shoe\\", \\"You Know My Name, Look Up the Number\\" and the single version of \\"Get Back.\\"  The first two, though not part of the \\"Let it Be\\" project, were comtemporaneous with the other songs and have the same sound. The Latter two were from singles related to the album.  It would have also been more in keeping with the traditionally generous song selection on other Beatle albums, and these songs have never properly been put on an album(and this would be the one).  Only eleven songs seems a bit stingy. The inclusion of these songs would have made this a killer album at the time, on par with their other albums, instead of the sad affair it was. I also dislike the flippant title and art work.  In hindsight (always 20/20) it would have been much better to do a deluxe release of the original \\"Let it Be\\" that included these recordings. A double CD that probably would have made everyone ecstatic, since they would have what they want and could make the comparison. The Fly on the Wall bonus seems pointless and could have probably been much more substantial. Oh well.    In summary, greatly improved over the original in terms of songs and sound quality, but could use a few more songs for the money.  Get this one and forget the original.  If you have a need for the Spectorized versions for completeness or sentimentality, you can find them on \\"One\\" or other repackagings.

B0000DIJO2|4.0|I love the Bee Gees, always have. The DTS version gives you that fantastic Bee Gees music as it should be heard ... no problem there, loved it.

B0000AC8N4|5.0|This 1963 album finds Dexter Gordon in sparkling form. He is backed by Bud Powell on Piano, Pierre Michelot bass and Kenny Clarke drums. Its one of the best sessions Gordon ever recorded and is an essential purchase for any Jazz fan.<br /><br />Dexter Gordon is in fine form throughout the album. Just take the opening Charlie Parker classic 'Scrapple from the Apple'. The theme is stated and Gordon takes the first solo. Three and a half minutes later he finishes. Theres no apparent repetition here, or use of a stock of standard riffs that you might hear with a lesser musician. Throughout this solo he is inventive using the full range of the Saxophones marvellous palette. The other stand-out track on here for me is his version of 'A Night in Tunisia'. Whether he's throwing in a quote from 'Summertime' or bending notes on this form Gordon was up there with the very best. On a few moments in his solo on Tunisia I was reminded of Coltranes Soprano solos. Whilst there is no doubt that in his early career Gordon was an undoubted influence on Coltrane I wonder if at this stage Gordon was actually being influenced by Coltrane.<br /><br />Its worth mentioning the appearance of Bud Powell on the album. He was the most important Jazz pianist before Bill Evans arrived in the late 1950's. Sadly he suffered from mental health problems and his playing later in his career (from the late 1950's onwards) could be erratic. On this recording he isn't the whirlwind of 10 years earlier, but his playing is mostly consistent and considered of sufficient standard for 'Like Someone In Love' to be put out as a bonus track on the CD.
B000E5KJEI|4.0|The movie is definately good.  The tear for me is that I thought the story/plot isn't very deep.  But...but...as a film, it was well done.  I'm a sucker for visuals and this movie looked beautiful.  I loved the intro and ending and the score and of course the great acting.      Now, the HD-DVD is about as good as you can get it for a movie of its \\"age\\".  It's not an old movie but not a super new one either.  I loved the transfer and the actual landscapes looked amazing even at 56\\".  Granted, dark shots have grain because that's the way film (even digital) works but when there's beautiful outdoors shots, this disc definately takes advantage of them.  A great transfer unlike a few early bad ones I've seen out of the HD & BD camps.

B00003CXCT|5.0|While I Love the remakes as much as the originals, I think my favorite part of this collection is the bonus disk. There are interviews and lots of \\"making of...\\" footage where we get to really see them putting together the original \\"low budget\\" films. My favorite part was when they were filming the ultimate destruction of the death star and you hear some guy in the background go \\"boom!\\"<br /><br />The \\"secrets\\" behind the making serve only to add to my enjoyment, no matter which version I am watching....
B000QFCD2W|4.0|The King Is Back!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Wow, what a freaky album. Pure Diamond! I think it is some of his best work. It gave me chills! You have got to love the cover, too!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get IT!
B000QFAJ7S|4.0|I don't think she lived up to her full potential... but than again I dont think that about any of her past albums either. I'm not saying this cd was bad in any way. I kind of like it actually... alot actually. It reminded me sort of Hole (pre courtney in rehab) and a little of Veruca Salt. It is a very different sound for her and if she should so choose to remain in the harder genre. It may take a while for her to gain acceptance and a \\"rocker\\". But she has shown she's got it in her.. she has a beautifuly emotional voice.<br /><br />I have to admit I love how there is not one hook in this album.
B000N4SHOE|5.0|I rented this DVD for my wife, thinking it was the kind of thing she'd enjoy.  She loves period films and adores Renée Zellweger.  I'm not typically fond of either of those two things so I didn't figure on watching much if any of the movie. But as the film started, and I happened to be in the room, I realized quickly that this is a charming and warm movie built on a strong character.    Notably, Renée Zellweger seems to nearly disappear into the role of Beatrix Potter and you quite forget that you're watching her act. It's rare to see that kind of skill but when it is captured in a movie like this it's magical.    Ewan McGregor is every bit the modern leading man but with a respectful nod to the dashing gents of yesterday's Hollywood.  He is easy-to-like and doesn't for a moment feel as though he's trying to 'star' in this movie.  He's more than happy to let the movie become its own entity in which he is but a part.    I began by saying that I wasn't sure I'd even sit down and watch this film, so it's worth noting that I sat entertained straight through to the end as was glad I did.  This is certainly something you can watch with the kids, though the romance and the character development might be a bit slow for some of the younger ones.    One very odd thing to mention is that the DVD cover art is quite strange in that it shows Ewan McGregor clean shaven.  But when you watch the movie you'll realize that he sports a moustache throughout.  Not sure why the difference in appearance from one to the other but it was something that caught my eye as I navigated to this page to leave this review.  It hardly matters though... this movie is about so much more than just a moustache.  :)    5 Stars!  Highly recommended!!
B000021Y77|5.0|What a great movie? I've loved it since the first time I saw it... eight years ago or so. The sound track gets repepetitive at times .. but it's still a wonderful film.
B000083C49|4.0|A commercial and critical success, 1986's \\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\\" has a simple premise: The principal crew of the starship Enterprise must travel back in time to retrieve a couple of whales in order to communicate with an alien probe that is causing climactic devastation to Earth.<br /><br />The actors, after having known their respective characters for over a quarter century (at the time of the film's production), could perform these roles blindfolded.  They immerse themselves into them and are believable, although Walter Koenig's Russian accent, as Chekow, has always been a bit forced.<br /><br />That said, the second disc is filled with something for the fan, non-fan, and the individual interested in a film's production.  Two fond tributes are offered: one on Trek creator Gene Roddenberry and another on character actor Mark Lenard (\\"Sarak\\").  On the former, Gene's son Eugene recalls times with his dad and these recollections are quite revealing and entertaining.  The latter is a loving homage to the multitalented Lenard by his surviving wife and two daughters.<br /><br />Fascinating info on the science behind the film's storyline, a \\"Vulcan primer,\\" and a look at the special effects are also presented.<br /><br />But, the most \\"insightful\\" bonus is a look at \\"Kirk's women.\\" Four actresses (Louise Sorel, Celeste Yarnell, Katherine Browne, and Catherine Hicks) recall what it was like to appear on the series or the theatrical films.<br /><br />They also talk about working with Shatner and Nimoy, which makes for some interesting comparisons.
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|I'm typically not a big Mark Wahlberg fan.  That whole Marky Mark thing still haunts me.  I saw this movie at the theater because there was nothing else showing.  I did so reluctantly at a friend's request.  I was pleasantly surpised by how good it actually was.  This movie just rocks along.  There was never a slow part that made me lose interest.  This is one of those rare times where Hollywood didn't drop the ball and deliver something purile and geared for the socially-retarded moviegoer.  Non-stop action with a clever plot and good actors.<br /><br />Mark Wahlberg is Bob Lee Swagger, an ex-marine scout sniper that ended his military career after a botched mission in Africa left his partner and friend dead and him to fend for his life.  Holed up in the mountains for the past three years, Swagger is visited by a mush-mouthed colonel (Danny Glover) with a mission.  Seems like there is going to be an attempt on the President's life, and they want Swagger to figure out how they're going to do it.  Pure recon mission.  Right!  Well... Swagger gets set up after the attempt on the President goes down, killing an Ethiopian Bishop instead of the President.  On the run and wounded, Swagger has every law enforcement agency in the nation howling for his blood.<br /><br />This is great entertainment, pure and simple. Wahlberg is cool and calculating and detatched in the way that reminds me of the early Dirty Harry movies with Clint Eastwood.  He is brutal and it rocks! Michael Pena does great as the FBI agent roped into helping Swagger and Kate Mara is pretty and tough as Swagger's dead partner's widow who helps him when no one else will.  Ned Beatty plays the creepy Senator behind the whole dark mess.  Great action and smart script.  Training Day director Antoine Fuqua directs.  Excellent!<br /><br />Dig it!

B000NVIGC0|4.0|I think that this is a great album.  Its a little more jam than previous albums but I still like it alot.  The title song Sky Blue Sky is awesome.
0790742780|4.0|This is easily Michael Douglas's best ever acting performance. In Falling Down he is a man on the very edge of a complete breakdown. The problem is that anybody who upsets him is likely to come off badly.<br /><br />At the start of the film we see 'D-Fens' (Douglas) in his car in a non-moving traffic jam. Its a boiling hot day, his air-conditionaing has packed up and everything is annoying him. Eventually he just walks away and leaves the car saying hes going home. Home it turns out is where his estranged wife and daughter live. To get there he has to walk miles and its his journey home that the core of the film revolves around. The set-pieces in this film are very well done. In particular his visit to a store to buy a pair of hiking boots is brilliantly done. Robert Duvall plays the Policeman (who is retiring that day) who realises that De-Fens is very dangerous indeed. Duvall as always is excellent and in an under-stated way matches Douglas's very edgy performance.<br /><br />The film isn't without its faults. The message that D-Fens is cracking up is hammered home over and over, uneccessarily in my view. We can see this from D-Fens actions, so the frequent shots of people carrying placards emphasing this point weren't needed. However overall this is a well directed and very well written film.
B00002ND77|5.0|The end of this movie closes with a bunch of people (mostly children) from around the world boldly declaring \\"I am Malcolm X\\". The symbolism was not lost on me. Malcolm X spoke to more than just a generation. He speaks to us from the grave even now. The fire and passion that colored his early religious segregationist speech died out shortly before he was murdered, tempered by a tolerance the world would be forever denied.<br /><br />It is unclear what sort of mark Malcolm X WOULD have made on society had he lived, but what IS clear is that the influence he held on the civil rights movement is undeniable. His fire and the passions of men like Martin Luther King paved the way for some of the most historic moments in American history.<br /><br />But this movie doesn't stop with painting that well-known picture of Malcolm. We see Malcolm in his early days as a street hustler. We see him courting his beloved Betty and eventually fathering some four children. We see him as the protector and provider for his family. We see him as inquisitive and stern. Self-assured with a desire to know everything. Curious but confident. Influential but, at times, easily influenced by circumstances in which he found himself.<br /><br />Malcolm X was undoubtedly a profoundly flawed human being. But it is that same humanity that allowed him to reach such greatness. It is that humanity that we celebrate today, regardless of our own skin color.<br /><br />While I'm certain some literary license was taken where necessary, I do believe this movie was about as accurate a depiction of Malcolm X as you can make, without running the risk of being disrespectful to the memories of Malcolm and his beloved Betty.
B00005JPFC|5.0|You know that feeling after you see a really good film that makes you feel all warm and fuzzy inside, and you laugh because you just spent the last two hours laughing at some real smart comedy, and you smile because you actually care about the characters? Ratatouille is one of those films.    Pixar is, and will always be, number one in animation, storytelling, and filmmaking. If all major Hollywood studios made films as good as Ratatouille, I'd probably be broke right now from seeing all of those movies. I don't know how Pixar does it. They seem to score every, single time. And that's what I love about Pixar. They win, and they know how to make good films.    Ratatouille scores a creative, funny, heartfelt, and genuine script from director Brad Bird. I had the opportunity to see him at San Francisco's Wondercon a few months ago, and I could see his passion up close in his eyes and how much he cares about Pixar's films.    Each scene has a purpose in Ratatouille. Remy, the rat hero of the film, dreams of becoming a chef, inspired by his hero, Gusteau, a French chef who just died. Remy meets Linguini, the klutsy garbage boy, and together, they become the greatest chefs in Paris. With the help of Colette, the only female in the kitchen; Emile, Remy's rat brother who eats anything; Anton Ego, the premier restaurant critic of Paris; and Skinner, the greedy head chef who wants to bask in Gusteau's fame, Pixar creates some of the most memorable characters. Laugh out loud scenes reveal new details about the plot as Linguini interacts with Remy. And to top it off, the finale of Ratatouille may be the most satisfying finale of a Pixar film ever (but I shall not spoil it here). For such a simple plot, some may think that Ratatouille scores low. But the heart and genuine humor bring Ratatouille to rival the greatest films ever created.    The look and sound of Ratatouille is incredible. Ratatouille boasts one of the most visually brilliant films, animated or not animated. Streets of Paris are marvelous as Remy gets chased from the chef. The kitchen of Gusteau's is full of energy. The sewers, from human perpective, are dark and gloomy. But when the camera turns to the rats' perspective, the sewers look and feel like heaven. And let's not forget the incredible score, which should and will get an Oscar nomination for original score this year.    In some ways, the story of Ratatouille mirrors how Pixar runs its company. Gusteau, I would imagine, is Brad Bird and all the geniuses at Pixar, because Gusteau carries those values of being able to showcase your talents. Gusteau addresses the mediocrity of society but also reminds us the importance of finding our talents and passions saying, \\"Anyone can cook.\\" Remy, I assume, is Pixar, because Remy has a dream to be the greatest chef, just like Pixar is the greatest film studio. Just like how Linguini uses Remy to help showcase their talents together, Disney uses Pixar to gain fame and fortune.    If you ever get the chance to meet someone who has already seen Ratatouille, go strike a conversation with them. I bet you a free movie ticket that the person only has things to rave about the greatness of Pixar's Ratatouille.    \\"Anyone can cook, but only the fearless can be great.\\" Ratatouille is a winner!
B0001L3MI0|5.0|This movie as off the charts with the special effects. Not to mention some of the best lines in any movie of the decade in which it was made.<br /><br />Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, Adam Baldwin, Judd Hirsh, Bill Pullman, Mary McDonnell, Vivica A. Fox, Harry Connick Jr., Brent Spiner and an ensemble cast too numerous to name have come together to create an \\"end of the world\\" story that triumphs in the spirit of the American Revolution. (And on July 4th nonetheless).<br /><br />I'll never forget these words from the president's young daughter...<br /><br />\\"Is mommy sleeping now?\\"<br /><br />Yes, Mommy's sleeping.<br /><br />if that exchange did not make you cry, you have no heart.

I cant think of one type of person who will not benefit from reading (and doing what it says) this book:)
B00005J6UP|5.0|This movie was little more than your typical 80's \\"Teen angst\\" movie, starring Sean Astin, Josh Brolin and (we hope) a sober and drug free Corey Feldman. A search for pirate treasure, a trio of bad guys who keep their deformed brother locked in a basement and an Indiana Jones-like trek through tunnels, caves and booby traps takes this from a campy 80's kid flick to an enjoyable Richard Donner film.<br /><br />I just watched it again this past weekend with my 9 year old. He sat wide-eyed at the tense parts, laughed his toosh off at the funny parts and raised a freaked out brow at the first sighting of Sloth...<br /><br />And when it was all over, he asked me a very simple question... \\"When's part two coming out?\\"<br /><br />I didn't know what to tell him. After 20 years, if they haven't made one by now, they're not likely to make one. \\"Chunk\\" at 35 just wouldn't be as funny.
B000P2A256|4.0|This album has floored me, just as much as the last one did. I'm loving the way he expresses himself in each song, using profanity when it is called for. If you have not bought it. BUY IT. It's one of those \\"i love every track\\" type of album.
076790382X|4.0|This book has a charming premise.  Bryson is an American writer who lived in Britain for over twenty years, marrying an Englishwoman and raising two children.  He moved back to the States with his family, where he wrote a series of essays about America for a British audience.<br /><br />Bryson is a keen and witty observer of life.  How many of us could write an entire essay prompted by the existence of a 24-hour help line on a dental floss dispenser?  The essays are uniformly amusing, sometimes side-splitting.<br /><br />Thought not as consistently funny as Dave Barry, Bryson goes further by adding a healthy dose of thoughtfulness to it all.  Throughout the book he ponders what it means to be American, comparing and contrasting it with what it means to British.  Every so often the question of Canadianness pops in as well.

B00000AFWZ|5.0|This is a fantastic collection. Precisely what rock'n'roll was meant to be in the 1960's: Raw,snotty,youthful-and not necessarilly \\"great artistic\\" music or \\"classic rock\\", whatever the hell that garbage is,  like it degenerated into after the Sargeant Pepper album came out and ruined everything about real '60's rock'n'roll. While many of these bands were indeed influenced by The Stones (not to mention The Yardbirds,Kinks, etc.), it is completely unfair to compare them to British bands, since they had an attitude and sound that was distinctively American and all their own. Sure, many of these bands were one hit wonders or no hit wonders, but so what? Most of this is great music.    And in response to some reviews saying how this can't compare to The Rolling Stones, etc., in my humble opinion, most of this is far better. Anyway, I've always thought The Stones were one of the most overrated bands of all time. Real rock'n'roll isn't supposed to be great art nor take itself all that seriously.     Anyway, I suggest buying this collection if you like raw, unpolished, sixties punk. And I also recommend the \\"Back From The Grave\\" compilations.
B0000025RI|5.0|I had to inquire about who in his right mind would give this a \\"1.\\" It was obvious that one reviewer alone, who clearly never liked MJ, gave Thriller a poor rating four times using the term \\"hype\\" to clearly identify him/herself. The others who gave Thriller 1s were annoyed with the sound quality of the CD. Fact is, few albums can top this off: Dark Side of the Moon comes to mind, which says a lot about how perfect Thriller is. MJ may be a weirdo, but he sure made history here. I recently heard \\"The Lady in My Life\\" on the radio. I completely froze from its beauty.
B00006AVRK|4.0|You have to have a certain taste for Wodehouse's made-up world of total dodo-aristocrats. I find the plots quite funny albeit a little formulaic. Having watched a few of these, it is impossible to read the original stories without hearing Stephen Fry's voice as Jeeves. (For example, \\"No, sir\\" now acquires his unique intonation.) Separating Jeeves from Fry is like trying to imagine Rumpole as someone other than Leo McKern, that is, impossible. And reconciling Hugh Laurie's Wooster with his House is an interesting exercise in suspension of disbelief (which I happily engage in weekly).  This set contains a lot of Jeeves and Wooster. I figure to watch it over a period of a year or so.
B000P2A256|5.0|\\"Songs about Jane\\" was just a tough act to follow.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, this is a very good CD, (I did rate it 5 stars) and if it was their debut album, it would have been a solid way to come out. But if you are deciding between this CD or \\"Songs about Jane\\", I'd buy the other one and then pick up this one once you fall in love with Maroon 5.<br /><br />It's a great CD, but will be appreciated more by the fan than the newcomer. Thanks to Maroon 5 for keeping their style intact.
B000NQRWRU|5.0|Who would sell or--what's worse--buy, a DVD at that price?  $399.99?  This has to be a joke or a misprint or sheer insanity.  No movie is worth that much.  Heck, it isn't even in Hi-Def.  I've been waiting for this film to become available again on DVD, but I will certainly wait a lot longer until someone produces this title again at a sensible price.

B000AMJG4Y|2.0|First of all let me just say that my expectations were not too high for this movie.  I, as we all should, have considered that this movie is a sequel to one of the most renowned games of our time - Final Fantasy 7 - and as such I didn't expect it to surpass any such kind of sparkling record.    However, even with my lenient expectations for this film, I found that I was thoroughly disappointed with it.  And anyone should be, because the simple movie fundamentals that we all would normally expect to see in a film (i.e. feasible plot, character development, sensible dialogue, ...) were not to be found here.  One should always be concerned when the dialogue seems to be more about getting to the next fight sequence than about the actual plot or related to the plot.  And when the preceding plotline of Final Fantasy 7, which this film is supposed to follow, is taken into consideration the more complex, series-related inconsistencies add a deeper confusion to the already fundamentally underdeveloped film.    The combat, which this movie prides itself, is uninventive and unstylistic.  Usually the camera will be flipping around the battle so quickly and without any dramatic direction that you won't really be too sure what exactly just happened other than combat took place.  Everything else we've seen again and again - a mixture of combat styles taken from certain films like the Matrix and applied to a completely irrelevant story/world, creating a world lacking in style and uniqueness of its own.    As I feared would happen, this movie most seems like a final attempt by Square to squeeze all the money from the Final Fantasy 7 fanbase.  In other words, this film resembles the infamous \\"filler\\" episodes that we all fear, but even worse since it is a poorly developed filler.  This is because this film neither develops or builds upon the characters or world.  And even worse, this film doesn't provide any new perspective on any themes or ideas.  In fact, the only theme that reallyexists in this film is 'good versus evil.'  This may have been a satisfactory theme back when I was determining my personal values (Say... age 6) but now, as a mature adult, they feel more and more infantile each day.    As you will see, this film captures its audience purely with it's magnificent graphics.  While I too agree that the graphics used to render this film are very well done, I am inclined to remind the human race that there is more to life than the 'shiny shiny.'  Might I also remind that Square already released a movie with this quality of graphics - \\"Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within.\\"  With this in consideration, this movie needs to offer more substance than graphics simply alone.  We've seen this already!    Additionally, I expected at the least to enjoy some original, and generally absolutely beautiful, masterpieces of music from famed Final Fantasy 7 game composer Nobuo Uematsu.  But even here I was surprised to find such a disappointment.  The music in this film, again composed majorly by Nobuo Uematsu, did not reach or even resemble the quality of the classic compositions from the Final Fantasy 7 game.  An entirely new sort of emotional quality was present in the Advent Children soundtrack - one which resembles a typical poor quality action movie.  In this I mean that it is void of artistic quality, emotional presence, and dramatic significance.  Even worse, select tones in the soundtrack are hardly even varied, creating a sort of dull, monotone feel to the whole lot.  The only tracks that actually show creativity and artistry are too poorly placed in the film to evoke any emotional connectivity with the plot.    Folks, I'm sorry to break it to you, but this is why Nobuo Uematsu is leaving Square.  In his own words, Mr. Uematsu has revealed that the company is moving too quickly for his taste.  And to that, I salute you Nobuo Uematsu.  Always revel in quality, not quantity.

033041836X|3.0|After reading some of the other reviews, many of them positive, I decided to rate this book at a 3.  For those reviewers that thought this book was uplifting, I greatly disagree.  For those who rated this book solely on the grammar and mistakes, I disagree with that as well.<br /><br />This book was not uplifting because, while she came through her tragedy and had a lot to live for, she didn't convey that.  After the traumas in her life, she turned to drugs, alcohol, and various men to try to stifle the pain, rather than turning it into something that could inspire others to rise from the flames even more beautiful than before.  I realize that such an event as rape is a hard reality to face, being a victim myself.  I also understand that it can be so difficult to move forward, especially at a time in your life when the world is at your feet and anything seems possible.  I don't think this book could be considered uplifting in the least, but I hope for her sake that it was cathartic for her to write it.<br /><br />As far as the editing goes, it was completely terrible as some of the other reviewers have said.  There were incomplete sentences, run-on sentences, and more fragments you can shake a stick at.  I didn't find spelling mistakes, but I also wasn't looking for them.  It was really hard to follow and get through the book, especially the first chapter, with all of the incorrect grammar and editing mistakes.  I'd thought about reading \\"The Lovely Bones\\" but will not at this point.  I can't handle another editing nightmare, as was this book.<br /><br />I thought the themes through the book were good and I am one to really enjoy a biography - that is the reason why I bought it.  I'd hoped for more learning experiences and less focus on how terrible a rape can be.  We all know how terrible it is and we all know how hard it can be to bounce back.  I don't think she ever really did.  Unfortunately for her, she's made a choice to let tragedy haunt her life and overpower her, just as it did that night in May of 1981.  It is sad and while I hope she moves on, I'm not sure she will.<br /><br />My recommendation would be for someone interested in potentially reading this book, don't.  If you want a good biography, read Alan Alda's [[ASIN:0812974409 Never Have Your Dog Stuffed: And Other Things I've Learned]].

B000LC55F2|5.0|I thoroughly love watching The Prestige.  Once in a while a great movie will come along that I can watch over and over and be entertained continuously.  This is one of those films.  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are great as the main characters and the plot is just wonderful. I imagine the book is just as great and I think that the film makers did a really nice job with the material. It's innovative, deceiving, thought provoking and overall excellently put together.  Enjoy.
1400063515|1.0|I picked up this book thinking that the premise was interesting.  Sadly this book is horrific.   The author is encumbered with an unchecked ego and his sense of superiority drips disdain on his readers and the rest of the world.     He decries editors, yet could have used a good one.     The book is rambling, poorly organized and his points aren't that interesting. One of his main arguments uses the story of an author whose unconventional book becomes a best seller only to have the sequel flop. This is complete fiction though--there is little to no real science in this book, just the ramblings of an egomaniac. His main points are neither new nor particularly exciting. This book seems just to have been written to show off how smart he thinks he is.     Overall it would be mildly interesting if he didn't write so poorly, but alas there is little to be gained from this book other than frustration and the loss of a few hours of your life.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This is a great film! Edward Norton is incredible as usual.  A lot of people have been comparing this to The Prestige since both were released around the same time and are about illusionists, but that's about it.  I think both movies are excellent but each has a life of its own.  The Illusionist is a modest yet extraordinary love story that happens to be centered around true magic.  Definitely worth a look.  Enjoy.

This is a movie that brings new meaning to the expression \\"Chain her to the kitchen\\".<br />Samuel L. Jackson has to fight the temptation to guzzle demon whiskey and play even more demonic slide guitar, Christina Ricci has to fight the temptation to bang anything in pants and Justin Timberlake has to fight the temptation to act badly.<br />I enjoyed the silly Jim Thompson-styled pulpy vibe of the film and loved the dirty electric slide guitar playing in the bar scene. Jackson isn't a bad blues singer, not bad, he's alright. I thought this was one of the best films with blues taking center stage. Excellent!

0321344758|5.0|I love the fact that this book practices what it preaches. It is a book about good design and making things simple and it does exactly that with a simple layout and clear narrative. This may seem like a small thing but it most definitely is not. Making things very clear and concise is much more difficult than just writing and rambling. This book was designed to be read in a single airplane ride so it is fairly light weight. But this does not mean that the content is not deep.    As a web developer, the information in this book in invaluable when attempting to see your work though your user's eyes. Do youself a favor and take this book to heart. The chapter on how to do usability tests for cheap is worth more than the price of the book on its own.
B00005JPFC|5.0|Before I saw The Incredibles all I knew about Brad Bird was that he was a character designer and animator for The Simpsons and he made the very underrated The Iron Giant. After I saw what he could do with CGI animation I became a Brad Bird believer. You can guess that I was excited to see Ratatouille. Bird is a writer/director that doesn't dumb down animation. For some reason it's believed that animation is for kids only. Television has proved that there is an audience in the key 18-49 demographic for animation. Brad Bird makes movies that can be viewed by anyone, and Ratatouille is no exception.<br /><br />Ratatouille is the story of a rat named Remy who lives with his father and brother and their colony. Remy enjoys good food while his family enjoys eating trash. He wishes one day that he could leave the gutters and go out in the world to cook and create different flavors. After a near-death incident he is separated from his family. While he is alone he conjures up in his imagination the spirit of Chef Gusteau, his idol. Gusteau basically acts as Remy's conscience for the duration of the movie. When Remy discovers he actually lives in Paris he accidentally gets trapped in Gusteau's former restaurant. Linguini is our human protagonist and was just hired as a trash boy for the kitchen. When Remy creates a brilliant soup it is Linguini who gets credit for it and now the two team up to become the best thing to hit Paris. The film is full of colorful characters that are not empty or dull. Every character is developed and completes some journey in this film, which you don't usually see. Usually only your hero goes through the journey, but we come to terms with every fantastic character in the film.<br /><br />The great thing about Ratatouille is that Brad Bird does not dumb the story down just because it's animation. He plays everything for real even though his main character is a talking rat. You see other movies like Meet The Robinsons which have clich&eacute;d characters and humor dumbed down for kids because it's much easier that way. What Brad Bird does is he crafts a story that is simple enough for children to follow and enjoy but he delevopes it in a mature way that an older audience can watch and relate to. During my screening I heard countless of kids asking their parents \\"what is going on\\"? So, there are things here that may fly over a child's head. Things like flashbacks to the childhood of an evil food critic that awakens the life inside of him, blossoming love between two co-workers, or Gusteau's replacement hiding from Linguini that he is the biological heir to the restaurant. The way I saw it is that Remy's story was for the kids. He is a rat who wants to cook and has to overcome society's view of him in order to make it. Linguini's story is for the older audiences as it deals with more real life things kids can't relate to yet. Overall this is a brilliant animated film that makes me love Brad Bird as a filmmaker even more.<br /><br />Another aspect that has to be admired is that the animators have done a wonderful job creating a believable environment. Character design is one thing in animation, but it's the stuff that you don't notice that is the most important. The design of the interiors, the walls, the doors, the floor tiles, the clothing on the characters, the streets, the way the light falls and everything else. I was just amazed at how much detail went into this film. I tried to imagine this as a small budget romantic comedy and felt like the sets were real. The majority of the film takes place in the one restaurant, but the restaurant feels like a world in itself. The film was just simply amazing to watch.<br /><br />One thing that I still remember about The Incredibles is Michael Giacchino's incredible (no pun intended) score. Giacchino has come a long way from scoring video games and thanks to his work on the show Lost he is finally getting some recognition. The role Giacchino's score plays in this movieis indescribable, and it should be since its music and music needs to be heard. It completes the atmosphere that Brad Bird has created. It gives it that French flare that makes you believe you are in France. The score is quiet at times but will kick it up in a jazzy way from time to time. Giacchino composed a song with singer Camille that plays halfway through the film and during the end. It is a perfect incorporation of the themes and gives the film that perfect flavor. I don't speak French so I don't know the vocals, but it's a beautiful piece.<br /><br />We also get some great voice acting. Patton Oswalt was a delight as Remy. Ian Holm played the evil cook, Skinner and you would never know it was him hiding his British accent with a French one. Brad Garret plays the spirit of Chef Gusteau while Janeane Garofalo plays the voice of Linguini's love interest. Linguini himself is played by voice actor Lou Romano. Rounding out the great cast is Peter O' Toole as Anton Ego the evil food critic.<br /><br />The film was a delight. It was beautiful and heartwarming featuring a brilliant story about finding one's self, but most importantly it was original. It wasn't like the rehashed crud you usually find in theaters, and I'm speaking on behalf of both animation and live-action.

067003830X|5.0|This is the most interesting book I've read about brain science . . . and the most relevant.  I highly recommend you read it!<br /><br />If you haven't been following brain science, you may wonder what all the fuss is about.  Recent experiments have overturned a long-held tenant of brain science:  That specific mental and bodily functions can only be directed from one location in the brain.  Destroy that section and physicians have told you that you were out of luck.  This conclusion doomed many who had suffered strokes and other brain injuries to having no hope of improvement.<br /><br />The good news, as described in this easy-to-understand popular treatment, is that the brain can actually relocate functions to new areas if the primary site is destroyed.  As a result, stroke victims can gain control over movements by therapy designed to disable their abler body areas . . . forcing the brain to establish new circuits to control the areas with little or no control; the blind can learn to \\"see\\" using sensor inputs from other areas of their bodies; those without balance can relearn balance through using other feedback mechanisms; and those with \\"phantom\\" pain tied to missing limbs can trigger elimination of that sensation.  The only continuing limitation seems to be that some areas of the brain are only open to maximum flexibility during short periods of life.  But promising research suggests that biochemical tools may be able to reopen those pathways to progress.<br /><br />Chances are that your physician won't know about all of these advanced therapies.  If you or someone you know has neurological disorders, you should read this book to see where to send them for help.<br /><br />Be sure to check out the sections on how psychoanalysis can be used to rewire the brain to change sensations, reactions, and behavior, and the appendices on cultural impacts on the brain and the potential for perfectibility.
B00005JPQT|4.0|Die Hard is considered by many film buffs as the greatest action movie ever made. There is just something about the character of John McClane that attracts movie goers. Is it his spunky attitude or is it the fact that he is known for having really bad days? It's both. There have been action franchises that have run out of steam in the past, but all three Die Hard films were great fun. Usually I'm not a fan of dipping into the well one too many times, but if Batman Begins and Casino Royale were able to re-spark the magic then why not give Die Hard another go?<br /><br />Live Free Or Die Hard takes an old fashioned cop and throws him out of his element, which leaves room for a supporting character. Justin Long steps in as McClane's frazzled and tech wizard sidekick. Timothy Olyphant plays a cyber terrorist who decides to shutdown the entire nation in order to systematically collect hundreds of millions of bank account numbers in order to show the government that the system can in fact be broken. Now it's up to John McClane and his sidekick Matthew Farrell to save the day.<br /><br />What follows is high octane action that one expects from a Die Hard movie. An important thing to point out is how director Len Wiseman stayed true to the Die Hard style and kept CGI to a minimum. Die Hard movies were great because they did action using real stunts and real explosions. The one thing I was afraid of was that this new Die Hard would go with the trend and use CGI as a crutch when in fact it used it as a tool. There are plenty of stunts that are real sets and real explosions. A few scenes fallback on CGI, but only because doing them for real just wouldn't work. Bruce Willis also keeps the spunk that is John McClane. You'll laugh at the one-liners and the witty remarks that Willis adds in the tensest situations and of course Justin Long is just great with sarcasm. They make a great on-screen duo. I also think that the humor in the Die Hard series is what makes it such a great action series. It's the fact that the filmmakers realize they are making an action movie; a movie in which nothing could ever happen in real life. Lots of action movies take themselves too seriously and they become laughably bad, but Live Free Or Die Hard keeps that spunk that makes it laughably enjoyable. Don't get me wrong though; there are some amazing action scenes that will make you tense up. This is by no means a comedy. The elevator shaft scene was one that stood out and reminded me of the trailer hanging off the cliff in Spielberg's The Lost World.<br /><br />Moving onto the score this brings up Marco Beltrami. I can state here that I am not a Marco Beltrami fan. The only score of his that I liked was his score to The Three Burials Of Melquiades Estrada. I always feel like he never does anything thematic at all and which is why I was worried when he was selected to fill Michael Kamen's shoes. Michael Kamen was the composer of the first three Die Hard films, but sadly he passed away in 2003. He was a greatly respected composer and his work on the first three Die Hards were iconic. Thankfully Marco Beltrami rose to the occasion and did a wonderful tribute with his score to Live Free Or Die Hard. He touches on some themes that Kamen wrote and gives it that Die Hard feel and atmosphere.<br /><br />Overall this movie was great. I had a great time watching it and felt like it was better than most of the high budget stuff I've seen this summer so far.

0394818237|5.0|This was a favorite book of mine when I was a child and I was glad to see it still in publication.  I purchased it for my four year old who loves books.  I think it is great because it not only shows a variety of occupations but also shows a great deal about how things work.  It shows wiring and plumbing for a house, how they process grain into flour which becomes bread, etc.  My child is still trying to grasp where food comes from (since we don't live on a farm) and where water comes from (out of the tap) and where it goes (down the drain).  I also reccommend his Busy Town book which is in a large format also.

1594489505|4.0|\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" by Khaled Hosseini  is a book that the author researched while visiting Kabul.  It is a story of friendship between two very dissimilar women who were ages apart in background and in education. They became close in order to survive and to endure the environment that they were forced to live in.  The reader grows to understand that there existed between them a closeness like that of a mother and daughter.  This intimacy was built upon much mutual respect and much love which these two (2) stunning characters generated for each other.  The novel is really the story of the lives of Laila and Mariam.<br /><br />The title for this novel comes from a 17th Century poem by Saib-e-Tabrizi which was a beautiful poem written in praise of Kabul.  The excerpt from which the title originated goes like this: \\"One could not count the moons that shimmer on her roofs, or the thousand splendid suns that hide behind her walls.\\"<br /><br />But the beautiful poem begins its praise of this city with these lines:<br /><br />  \\"Ah! How beautiful is Kabul encircled by her arid mountains<br />  And Rose, of the trails of thorns she envies<br />  Her gusts of powdered soil, slightly sting my eyes<br />  But I love her, for knowing and loving are born of this same dust<br /><br />These lines above symbolize so much of this novel.  It is the understanding of their fate and the knowing and the loving of each other; it is the sticking by their heritage and their people which clearly demonstrates how Mariam and Laila were also \\"born of this same dust\\".  The thorns in their lives which they both had to endure did not silence them and in their own ways they each made a contribution to each other to contribute either to each other's life or to the other's legacy.<br /><br />In reading this novel, the reader will be stymied by what the women of Afghanistan had to endure in the face of oppression and in some instances complete domination.  Mariam's and Laila's story is not, I imagine, the story of every woman, but it is their story, told so eloquently, by Hosseini.<br /><br />Reading the novel will make you sad, it might make you feel uncomfortable and in some parts you will wish that you could do something; even though you realize that this is a book of fiction.  But literature that tells a story as powerful as this one, and possibly with as much truth about circumstances in it...cannot always be happy.  The reader must be willing to look into the window of these women's lives and realize that the spirit of these women will not be broken and that both will be able to make decisions that they are strong enough to endure.  Giving back to others \\"born of this same dust\\" is the ultimate gift that both women can give to Kabal, its people and to each other.<br /><br />A worthwhile book.<br /><br />Bentley/2007<br />[[ASIN:1594489505 A Thousand Splendid Suns]]eir story, told so eloquently, by Hosseini.

B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|This rating system is so stupid. Half of the people are rating this movie a 1 just because they are HD-DVD fanboys and are mad because HD-DVD is on its last leg and on its way out. They rate it a 1 without even seeing the movie on BD, just because they are anti-BD. That is not a review, its just some moron commenting on stuff he doesnt know anything about
B00006I53S|5.0|I just recieved this lens and quickly shot some photos to test it's proformance. I went from total darkness to bright sunlight and produced excellent photos. The image stablizing feature was remarkable in low lighting situation without flash. I am very pleased so far.
B00003CXB2|5.0|I have every edition of this much watched movie.I have the \\"super bit\\" edition which sparkles  with nice color. The blue ray does not quite sparkle but it has the great sound I have come to expect from blue ray, and it is not finicky to play like the super bit edition. One can hear every bit of dialogue. This is my go-to edition from now on as of march 2013.
B00003CXDD|5.0|It doesn't get any better than this.  The imagery in this film is so wonderful that it runs through your mind for hours after watching it.  The colors are so bold, the scenes are beautiful, and if you ask me, the story is very enjoyable.  Plus, if there are fairies, it always gets five stars.

Banksy is unarguably a massive egotist and shameless self-promoter, and one may argue with his approach to what a street artist can do (anything he wants, according to Banksy). But those are mere quibbles compared to the amazing vision and wit that he possesses.

B00005JPLW|5.0|It was one of those weekends where my girlfriend and I wanted to go to the movies but didn't knew which one to see.<br />Out of being totally uninterested in all the other ones showing we went to see 300.<br />After seeing it I felt like the entrance fee was totally paid back to us in entertainment, we were rocked, thrilled, it was one of those movies were everything just clicked from the visuals to the sound track and the action... whoa, the action of the movie... awesome. Even my girlfriend kept talking about it for weeks...<br />After that day I measure how much I enjoyed a film comparing it to 300.<br />Pirates 3, Shrek 3, Spidey 3, transformers, the simpsons... they all pale in comparison to 300, the real winner of this movie season.<br />Don't listen to people that talk about how it is not historically true, or that just complain about smaller stuff in the film.<br />It is just pure entertainment, you will hardly take your eyes of the screen, buy it...<br />I know I will.
0060578793|5.0|In my youth I was a trained Green Beret and I wanted to see how this book educated one for survival. I found it to be well done with many interesting techniques and ideas  I had not been exposed to. The identification of edible and poisonous plants was extensive and too much to remember. It would be best to have the book in an actual emergency if that were possible. Overall, if you think you might remotelt thnk you may someday find yourself in a survival mode, do not hesitate to get and read this book.
B000R7HY0K|5.0|I hope they release them separately, because then I don't have to own Robert Rodriguez's umpteenth tongue in cheek action movie, Planet Terror, a joke that was pretty funny and nothing more. All I want is the real thing; Death Proof, Quentin Tarantino's more than respectable follow up to Kill Bill, a film that satisfies the foolish exploitation criterion, and then blows Planet Terror into oblivion by taking things into reality and satisfying serious dramatic criterion. Just give me the special editions of Kill Bill and Death Proof and I am set.

0609000195|5.0|I just finished reading \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" which was the author's first book, and my mother recommended that I read this one.  It was also a first book and a Booker Prize winner to boot.  They were similar in some ways.  Both books were about twins and disfunctional families, and the harm that causes.  But this one was set in India in the 1960's, so a much different setting.  This one also delved into racial and class dissention, and even touched on political dissention with the bits about the Indian Communist party.  This was a dreamlike book that wove in and out from when the twins were six or seven to when they were eleven to when they were grown up.  It showed how a catastrophic event can forever change a family, and it showed how difficult it is for children to grow up normally with families that are disfuntional and families full of issues that are never dealt with.  Ms. Roy's dramatic sense of prose is quite wonderful.  Her characters are full and rounded and descriptions are magical.  She is a wonderful writer and uses words like a tapestry to outline the pictures that she wants to create.  I recommend that you read this book and \\"The Thirteenth Tale\\" by Dianne Setterfield.  Each is quite wonderful in its own way.

0553582461|5.0|This book may cause me to never read another fantasy novel, because well, how can anything else compare?  OK maybe I am being a little melodramatic, but this fantasy series is one of the best Ive ever read. It saddens me that my adventures with Fitz and the Fool (and the other incredible characters) may have come to an end (well except for any re-reading I will do). The ending was excellent, with plenty of book left to wrap up the plot lines. It is rather uncanny how Hobb somehow closes all the story line and it fits so perfect.     Please, Ms. Hobb, give us some more..... There is still plenty to see and do in the farseer universe

1843104954|5.0|excellent and very thorough-I learned a lot more than I did from Atwood's prior books, because I think that in the years Tony Atwood has been studying Asperger's syndrome, he has significantly deepened his knowledge.  My 14 year old daughter, who has Asperger's, also found it helpful. If someone is just going to buy one book providing a detailed overview of Asperger's Syndrome, this is arguably the book I would recommend.     I  found his section on cognitive abilities especially helpful, because my daughter has some of the problems described in this chapter. When her IQ was tested, there was a 40 point gap between two parts of the IQ test, namely verbal comprehension and working memory.  (Working memory,which is very different from long term memory, is the ability  to recall and manipulate information relevant to a certain task, such as an academic assignment).  Understanding this helped me understand her frustration with certain academic assignments, such as research papers.     I hope you find my review helpful!

Asi que concluyendo es un album que necesita digerirse y al final nos va a gustar a todos...
1401207529|3.0|I neither loved nor hated this book. After having it recommended to me from various friends, I decided to get it. To be frank, (no pun intended) it wasn't spectacular on any level. The art was decent, but not that great. The writing was alright, and overall plot was enjoyable, but just not that interesting. It seems like Batman Begins - great movie- was highly inspired by this book, and yet, the book version just didn't quite feel so rivetting.  The ending, was simply unsatisfying. I understand why it ended the way it did, but it just left me caring a lot less about the character and his exploits. It's actually so plain to me to make me wonder whether Begins would've been anywhere near as enjoyable without such a superb score(soundtrack).    I thought Catwoman's involvement in the story was completely pointless. She did have one good line but that's not really enough to justify her being thrown into this story.    Ultimately, I can't think of much to say because it wasn't memorable enough for anything to really stick with me. It was just.. ok.
B000PGTPE6|4.0|When I purchased the product, I believed it was a audio AND a video dvd. I received only the audio.  Excellent buy, but I was mislead on the purchase of two items not just the audio..  Entire selection (audio) is teriffic.............
B000OHZL1C|5.0|I have been captivated by this movie for many years now so the \\"HD DVD\\" purchase was just a foregone conclusion. With each viewing I'm totally moved by each actor (even you Quince;) and enthralled that this 3 hour marathon feels shorter than many 2 hour action flicks (like the new Die Hard). Brad Pitt surpasses anything I could have hoped for in the role of Death and this is one of the few times ever in the history of cinema I have seen Anthony Hopkins equaled in a film (but not bested:). The movie 5/5    Sadly, there are (again) no special features that weren't already on the standard def version, in fact the extra's here ARE in standard def which to me is like a slap, with a twenty and a fiver. However since we are dealing with a movie already clocking in at the 3 hour window I can overlook it. The extras 3/5    In closing, the tears are real, the performances are jarringly raw and all this is only heightened by one of the better looking HD DVD releases. Yes, all that glitters is not high definition gold.. or Blu, but in this case an upgrade is not only worth your money it's worth your Kleenex as well. Stock up. The conclusion 5/5
B00000634J|4.0|and two or three that are not.  This is the most complete collection of Lennon's solo work I've heard.  Lennon reminds me of the old poem about the little girl with the curl in the middle of her head.  When he was good, he was very, very, good (\\"Imagine\\"), when he was bad, he was horrid (the primal scream stuff he did with Yoko, which fortunately isn't included here).
B000GIXEIG|5.0|I cannot recommend this movie enough, or it's companion piece Wrath of God for that manner.Accepting the limited resources of independent film, I still can't get over how breathtaking this film looks. Going to icelannd nearly killed everybody but the results are up their on the screen.  I also loved the sympathy generated for Grendel, and felt it was a clever narrative decision on the film maker's part. Don't mind me babbling on, just watch it, it's great fun.

B000MXPE7O|1.0|The Good Shephard was one of those movies I had no desire to see in theaters so I rented it with a friend instead. I love movies that involve your complete attention and have to be watched more than once to catch everything- but this movie was terrible.  It jumped around way too much and left little explanations for any actions that were performed.  Unless you knew exactly what was going on during which year, and I'm assuming most people don't, then you become confused and aggravated trying desperatly to figure out what they are talking about.  My friend was even more aggravated than I was.      I don't recommend the movie if you are looking to be educated on the birth of the CIA.    Also, there is violence and sexuality in this movie so it may not be appropriate for kids.
B000PFUA9G|4.0|I have to give kudos to Mr. Paisley for the fantastic 5th GEAR, which just may be 2007's very best country album.  Prior to 5th GEAR, I'd never even heard any albums nor songs by Paisley.  I'll admit, I'm not as avid a country fan as compared to other genres of music (though I'm a `multi-dimensional' music listener as I like to put it), but I've been trying lately to truly cover all the bases of music aside from my comfort zone.  Honestly, Paisley's album truly excited me with his nearly pitch-perfect vocals, his adventurous songs, and his kick-butt guitar riffs.  Let's face it, if I were a musician, I would call Brad Paisley just to come and play electric guitar on my album because the man is so sick at it.  Sure, I've listened to a number of country albums including fine releases by Miranda Lambert (her CRAZY EX-GIRLFRIEND is also in the top echelon of releases in 2007) as well as the good, if somewhat bland underrated third release by Gretchen Wilson (ONE OF THE BOYS), but Paisley's 5th GEAR just feels more genuine in a number of respects.<br /><br />I could run down every song on the track list, but with an album this consistent, I don't think that it is necessarily in the least.  The album starts with the rousing \\"All I Wanted Was a Car\\" in which Paisley reminisces about how the other boys (in his teenage years) were looking for a slew of other things and he was simply searching for a car.  \\"All I Wanted Was a Car\\" turns out to be ultimately a simple song with poignant, telling lyrics that really make it more complex.  It is a personal favorite of mine with Paisley wailing on one of country music's most bluesy guitar solo of 2007 or for a couple of years for that matter.  The refrain is perfect for singing with Paisley and with the catchy nature of \\"All I Wanted...,\\"you will definitely be singing along.  First single \\"Ticks\\" is just as great and shows off Paisley's great sense of humor, something that Paisley and contemporary Joe Nichols seem to be exceptional at.  Again, the guitars are sick and the groove is definitely \\"in the pocket\\", as jazz musicians would say.  Mentioning in passing, the third straight consistent number, \\"Online\\" shows off Paisley's experimentalist tendency by featuring a tagged ending that includes a marching band.  Now how many country albums in 2007 have featured a marching band?  It's a rhetorical question, don't answer.<br /><br />\\"Letter To Me\\" slows things down while, \\"I'm Still A Guy\\" features sound-effects that transcend country music.  It is one you don't want to miss with bluesy fiddles, rollicking piano, and of course that signature guitar sound.  Moving down the track-list, \\"Mr. Policeman\\" is a true standout track that brings a traditionalist country feel out with a very liberal tempo filled with complex guitar riffs from Paisley.  For musicians, the track modulates several times as Paisley sheds through some sick guitar riffs.  At the end, none can deny how funny the tag is when Paisley sings \\"I'm in the jailhouse now\\", after all the singing and instrumental breaks.  \\"If Love Was A Plane\\" is certainly the most sweet song from 5th GEAR, while his duet with Carrie Underwood, \\"Oh Love,\\" is fantastic as well.  I don't usually mention interludes, but the interlude \\"Previously\\" leads into the phenomenal \\"Bigger Fish To Fry\\" in which Paisley reminisces how he used to cuss and do bad things as a child.  The moral of the story is that he bad things, which would be consider miniscule in today's society,  aren't a bad as other things and he resolves it to the fact that God has \\"bigger fish to fry\\".  After his rant, he follows with the appropriate \\"When We All Get To Heaven\\",  a very good interpretation on the church hymn and concludes the great album with an instrumental (very appropriate considering his musical skills), \\"Throttleneck\\".<br /><br />Face it, 5th GEAR might actually earn Paisley a Grammy nomination because it is nearly the perfect country album.  The tracks I didn't mentioned are asgood or nearly as good as the ones I did mention.  I highly recommend this fine album; it would make a great addition to any country fan's musical library or any fan of good, solid music.  4 stars Mr. Paisley.good as the ones I did mention.

0671027344|5.0|All of my friends read this during high school, so finally I bought it over the summer and read it in 3 days.

B0007P0LPC|5.0|i hv own this swan lake dvd for three yrs, but never thought about writing a review until now, why?  after i bought the dvd ( margot/rudof ), and watching it almost a dozen times either by myself or introduce it to a female friend, it ALWAYS made me cry at the end of act IV, never fail.  so,last week, i spent 40,000 of my precious united award miles, flew almost 12 hrs ( two stops, delayed 2 and 3 hrs here and there,etc)from california to new york to see ABT's ( american ballet theatre ) swan lake procuction at lincoln center.  boy, I WAS SO DISAPPOINTED!!!!!!!!  why? as usual:  act I's folk dance, i can tolerate it like everyone else,  act II ,III  i wasn't very happy with it already,but, i still have hope for the final act,but then when it comes to   act IV, the production has cut it almost into half !  what a shame.  hence, i recommand margot/rudof 's \\"swan lake\\" to anyone who is interested in purchasing a good dvd,never an \\" ABT \\" swan lake :)

B000QEILLK|3.0|First off, I absolutely love the Flower Kings and anxiously await their next release. This one though.....  OK, let me get this off my chest first - why, oh why would you play with the perfection that is the original \\"Church of Your Heart\\"? When I saw this on the CD's pre-release playlist on the TFK website, I was counting the days until it arrived just to hear a remastering of this song. (I think all TFK fans can agree that while \\"Stardust We Are\\" is one of the best albums of all time, it is also one compressed sonic mess). But instead of a nice clean remastering, we get a complete remix, and, gasp - an entire section of the song - a critical section in my eyes - is totally gone! Disappointed hardly covers it.  And therein lies the problem, for me. Most of these songs weren't just remastered, they were remixed as well. Instruments are added or taken away, changing the complexion of the songs in someways good but mostly not. For the most part, the new productions just don't stand up to the old. Several tunes, like \\"World Without a Heart\\" sound lifeless, are missing key instrumental parts (where is the lovely piano part in WWAH?) or have had the sometimes rough edges dulled down until they don't have the same impact the originals did.   Roine evidently has disdained the use of reverb for the new mixes, and for me, this new \\"dry\\" sound doesn't serve this type of music well.   Overall, it WAS a somewhat fun first listen, and of course the songs are pretty much wonderful anyway, but while there are great moments, I can't imagine listening to this one again anytime soon.  Having said that, thanks Roine for the effort - the liner notes are indeed exceptional, and maybe there is hope that you'll find time to go back and remaster (but NOT remix) the classic TFK albums like Stardust We Are, Flower Power and Rainmaker. Wouldja, please????
B000002GW5|5.0|A great album...I haven't any doubt. This album may be considered as a crossroad of the seventies' life of many artists (such as The Eagles). For first, the touring life, wich means to travel along many thousand miles away from home and family. For second, the drugs (problem already reflected in the Eagles' album \\"Hotel California\\" of 1976). For third, the emotional mixture of happiness and pain. This album reveals an important message: To enjoy as much as possible the life's best moments, wich are usually very short and pass very quickly...Think about a live concert. When the live concert of your favourite artist is over you can always remember it as an emotional experience, you can listen to the records and watch videos...\\"and you wake-up in your town\\" (the final verses of \\"the load-Out\\"). By the artist's side things are different. He moves through many towns wich begin \\"to look the same\\". When the live concert finishes \\"is just another town along the road\\". The only moment of relax and happiness is when the artis plays his songs on the stage, like a dialog between him ad his public, his fans, his friends. The touring life has its lightly moments during these meetings with millions of friends through the world, who love his music \\"tonight the people were so fine\\"...\\"We just pass the time in our hotel rooms and wander'round backstage...TILL THOSE LIGHTS COME UP AND WE HEAR THAT CROWD AND WE REMEMBER WHY WE CAME!\\" (from the song \\"the load out\\"). The same aspect it may be found in te song \\"the road\\", wich reflect a static moment of the touring life, when \\"the load out\\" reflects a dinamic, a traveling aspect (driving all night to another town)of a rock band's life. The indicated songs are the main guideline to enjoy the album...The other songs speak by themselves...specially by guitar, piano and vocal performances. One thing is for sure: Jackson Browne in this album sings by his heart.  I own it on CD and recently I recovered my uncle's 30 years old vinyl, wich I cleaned as best as possible and this one actually I use to play, to sense the past nostalgic seventies feeling.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|I first heard Sara Bareilles in a free song of the week on I-Tunes, the song was \\"Love Song\\".  Well, it blew me away.  It was instantly one of the best songs I heard this year and I was impatient for the rest of the album to come out.  Well, I was well pleased to hear the rest of this album.  She has a great talent, the songs fit together well and her voice is incredible.  She is reminiscent of Fiona Apple in her voice style but builds on that with the instrumental accompaniment to the songs, which complement her well.  If you want real new music, this is it.
B000IU3XTM|5.0|worth getting it indeed but the best experience from this artist I believe are the live performances. So if its possible, go to one of his shows.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|If you ever wondered what the Beatles would have sounded like if they had made an album after Abbey Road, pick up this album. Yes, it's that good. This album is simply amazing. It's just like The White Album -- a Paul McCartney song here (Either Way), a George Harrison song there (Impossible Germany), a Ringo Starr song here (Walken) and a John Lennon Song there (Please Be Patient With Me). It's an insanely fantastic record. And I wouldn't classify myself as a Wilco fan at all. I thought Being There was pretty good, Yankee Hotel was fairly good, Ghost is Born was not so hot... but Wilco have pulled it all together here. This album is addicting, infectious and absolutely stunning. I can't get enough of listening to this. Belive me... if you like Beatles' later work, you will absolutely love this album.
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Minutes to Midnight was an awesome release from LP, however I don't think it will receive the true respect it deserves.  The problem with popular bands is that when they change a style, they tend to get flak from fans.  If I was a band, I honestly would not want to do the same thing over and over again, but expand what our group was capable of.  Minutes to Midnight was that album; it changed the face of LP.  They evoked powerful lyrics as well as fresh new ways the group played as a whole and created this whole new world of music for us.  This album is less \\"techno\\" and more melodic in nature; which is a rather big change for them.  It does them justice, as they pull this off with great results.  Linkin Park is showing the world they are capable of more varied musical styles, which should be true, since they have great artists of all backgrounds playing with them.  A good testament of their new style would be \\"The Little Things Give You Away\\" since Chester is still belting out great vocals and the band is at their peak of melody.    Mike Shinoda also makes a great lyrical song called \\"Hands Held High\\".  The song is purely and simply vocals, drums, and an organ.  However, his lyrics are so powerful that it transcends the rapper aspect and goes more for a universal message, that all of us can understand and appreciate.  This album is a gem.  It's not the Linkin Park you've grown up on, but a testament on how well they perform together.  If you look up all the individual player in LP, you'll see there is a huge array of talents, and to see an album like this is not unusual.  I've never lost faith in LP and I'm always anxious for their next release.
B000P2A24W|3.0|I love the song on here Memory of Us, but I am sorry I just dont care for this Bon Jovi album as a whole. It is way too much country for my taste. Jon and the guys need to get back to their rock roots. Sorry Jon, I love you but please no more country.
B000G8NY4U|5.0|If you come across a better performance and production quality than this DVD, please let me know. After watching this DVD several times, I become paranoid that I may not be able to enjoy another DVD if it's not close to the caliber of this one.

B000QFAJ7S|5.0|I am a huge fan of Kelly Clarkson since her first time on AI. Have all her cds and I like them all. But I must say I LOVE this new music the best and I am VERY happy she stood her ground and did what she wanted and came out of the \\"Idol bubble\\" The songs on this cd are rocking and even the ballads have a smoking kind of Evanasence-\\"ee\\" sounding. Her voice is perfect, the music is perfect. I cant say enough about this cd and everyone (Kelly C fan or not) should definately pick this one up. You wont be sorry!
0671027344|4.0|I can usually tell if a book is good if it elicits some sort of emotional feeling from me. This one did, although it wasn't a great feeling. Made me kinda reflect on my own life. Very entertaining read. Kept me involved, loved the style.
B000P2A256|4.0|Another great cd from Maroon 5. I have no complaints. They are one heck of a talented band and I can honestly say that I love this whole cd. Do I love it as much as SAJ? No, and thats why I gave it four stars. But its still a really great cd. I recommend everyone giving it a spin.
B00006AUIG|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite movies.  One of the best psychological thrillers that I have ever seen.  The creepiness factor never diminishes for me.  Even on repeated viewings, I am still captivated by it.
B000SO7OMA|5.0|No exaggeration, the best I've ever watched.  Loreena Mckennitt is, to me, a Goddess.  Her voice goes right to my soul and seeing her face while she sings in HD makes the package perfect.  And it's not just her, the accompanists are excellent also.  I just can't say enough about this video.
B000NA28IE|1.0|I had high expectations after reading the book.  Far too many important concepts and ideas were left out of the movie which made for a lack of empathy for certain characters.  The flat out lack of characterization destroyed the quality of viewing for the movie.    After 10 minutes i had already realized i would be dissapointed and tried to watch the film without relating it to the book.  It was far to obvious though that there was major editing done that cut out sections of storyline.  There were times i thought \\"hey, how did the characters get to this point from nowhere?\\" and there were scenes in the movie that merely wasted time.  If they got rid of some of the pointless special effects and put in the simple important concepts then this could have been fantastic.    The acting was just plain horrid though.  I consider myself lucky i did not pay the outrageous prices of a theatre to view the movie with friends.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|One might call me a musicholic.  Okay, I am a musicholic!  I'm always searching for the ultimate unique musical experience and McKennitt's \\"Ancient Muse\\" delivers on the highest level.  If you enjoy ballroom dancing try \\"Kecharitomene\\"; it is a beautiful Bolero.  If you just enjoy listening then you will be swept away by this mystic tapestry.  The musicianship on the album is incredible.
B000NVIXDW|4.0|Buble's \\"Call Me Irresponsible\\" is a fine set with some real jewels.  He obviously idolizes Frank Sinatra & shines on \\"That's Life\\" with a punchy arrangement, \\"I've been up & down & over & out & I know one thing, each time I find myself flat on my face I pick myself up & get back in the race.\\"  Of my very two favorites are the opener \\"The Best Is Yet to Come\\" with its cheerful anticipation, \\"Wait till the warm-ups are underway, wait till our lips have met, wait till you see that sunshine day, you ain't seen nothing yet!\\"  \\"Me & Mrs. Jones\\" is a tale of an affair and was a startling Gamble & Huff soul track for Billy Paul.  Buble milks the jazz out of the track, while sounding quite soulful.  Harold Arlen is one of my favorite songwriters; so like other reviewers, I question the lisp on \\"I've Got the World on a String.\\"  It's probably supposed to be funny, but it sounds like he's making fun of the song.  Joel Peskin's sax on the track blows deliciously.  This set has some great gems.  Enjoy!

B000M3452Y|2.0|Why is everyone lauding this second effort from LCD Soundsystem so much?  It sounds like his first album.  I own his first double CD album and this, \\"Sound Of Silver\\", just sounds like a rehash of that.  It's well produced, fairly nice to listen to, but it just seems as if LCD Soundsystem realizes they have a hook, something that people will buy, so that's what they'll put out.  And unfortunately, I was duped into buying it.  I wasted money on an album ('Sound Of Silver') that I basically could have heard by listening to his first album.  All of the songs on this album sound like songs on his first, and the lyrics on some of the songs are laughable in the least, which I would quote verbatim from the lyric sheet, had I already not gotten rid of this CD, due to its taking up space in my CD rack.  'New York...', is a riot, anyone who produces a track like this cannot expect to be taken seriously.  I hope for his next album that he does better, although I'm fairly certain I won't be buying it anyway.
0060899220|5.0|I found this to be primarily an autobiography mixed with an expose of the restaurant industry which was interspersed with some more general culinary wit and wisdom. It was a highly enjoyable, quick read (he writes pretty much the way he talks). I highly recommend it, especially for fans of his Travel Channel program.

B00000I3JO|5.0|I was introduced to The Blue Nile from a friend. This album is like nice moody synthesizer music that reminds me of cloudy days and late nights alone. Unlike New Age, it isn't melodramatic, just nice and easy. Every track on the CD is ambient, cool, and relaxing, but once \\"Headlights On A Parade\\" starts, the album really takes a turn for the better I think. \\"From A Late Night Train\\" has a cool funky synthesizer sound that makes me want to smoke just listening to it. Great album to listen to when you want to be alone and watch the rain.
B000PHX4VA|5.0|The Police were and still are my all-time favorite band. But the last thing I need is another hits collection. I think we're up to four greatest hits packages with this band. C'mon guys! Break out the rarities and unreleased stuff. I know there's a ton. Perhaps this collection was put together to help booster this summer's reunion tour - like they needed any help with that. I still give it 5 stars - these songs are some of the best ever recorded in my opinion. Andy, Stewart and Sting will always rock!
0975309331|4.0|It was advertised to be an exact copy of the edition printed prior to 1933, 1918 I believe. There were a few times that analogies were put into the book that were not possible during that time. For example, a description was put in about bringing things into clarity like focusing your video camera.  This happened a few times and made me wonder how many other times the book was changed. Other than that it was awesome.
B000003BF1|5.0|A bit of rock, a bit of blues, a bit of soul, a bit of raunch... just what you need to make a classic Rolling Stones album! Some will say this is the group's best, and if it weren't for Country Honk (a fiddle-driven parody of the contemporary #1 Honky Tonk Woman, which is infinitely better), it would be. Now it'll have to settle for being prime Stones. I'm sure it won't mind.<br />Is Gimme Shelter the best opener the Stones or anyone else ever recorded? Possibly. It's a terrifying song, in a positive way: the best fade-in known to man, wailing harp, one of the best guitar solos known to man, and Mary Clayton's chilling vocal. Cool! And that guitar solo... Keith Richards is better known for his rhythm guitar, but his leads all over the record are excellent. You can hear more of that great playing on the hilarious, sleazy title, country-blues title track (Stu really gets down and boogies!), the creepy classic \\"blues opera\\" Midnight Rambler, where Charlie plays the drums of a lifetime; the sneering Live With Me, which is also pretty funny (and Bobby Keys plays a cool sax!), and the underrated blues Monkey Man, which is again quite funny (listen to Mick's monkey impression in the fade! And the guitar/drum tradeoff thing they do in the instrumental break! And Bill's vibes! What a SONG!) While we're talking about Keef Riffhard, alias the King of Cool, we must mention You Got the Silver. This was the first Stones song he sang lead on, and he sings it well - not a bad little country-folk tune either!<br />The Stones do the soft as well as the loud (an acoustic take on Robert Johnson's classic Love in Vain - love it!) and the philosphical as well as the sleazy (the multipart classic You Can't Always Get What You Want, my favorite Stones song ever - just listen to all the stuff they managed to layer into this one! Their best lyrics, too). What's not to like? Oh yeah, Country Honk. We'll just pretend that it's Honky Tonk Woman, shall we?<br />Oh, and a little message to anyone who thinks this is a rip-off of the Beatles' Let It Be. That's just proving you know nothing about either group. Let It Bleed was released before either the album or the single Let It Be. Besides, listen to both albums side-by-side. Pretty different, no?this is a rip-off of the Beatles' Let It Be. That's just proving you know nothing about either group. Let It Bleed was released before either the album or the single Let It Be.

B000P0J02E|4.0|I love this CD, in my opinion it is the best of the three movies and it certainly benefits from the full orchestral treatment.      I have no knowledge of musical theory but very much enjoy the way that the differing themes appear throughout the soundtrack and how, when they are played on varying instruments and to changed tempos, they present such different feelings. It is also fun to be able to recognise themes that have appeared in the soundtracks for the first and second movies.    If you are a fan of movie soundtracks I would definitely recommend Pirates of the Caribbean: At World's End
B00004VWAF|1.0|Okay, first off I'd like to say I have a lot of respect for this record. This is a mix of rock, funk, jazz and Indian music - I can't think of a single album that sounds even remotely like this one. It's a daring move. It's totally unique. It was very avant-garde, and well-performed. Some people see this is as a masterpiece, and judging by those terms, it's hard to argue with them.<br /><br />It just isn't very good. In fact, it's my least favorite Miles Davis album.<br /><br />Miles was a genius, of course. The Coltrane years and the Shorter/Hancock/Carter/Williams years are very rewarding. And while I'm not a huge fusion fan, I do LOVE In a Silent Way, and I like about half of B*tches Brew, half of Jack Johnson, bits of Live-Evil (What I Say rules!) and all of Pangaea. I do not, however, even remotely enjoy On the Corner. I don't hear any melodies in this at ALL. In fact, I don't hear much music in this at all. It's like Miles told his band, \\"Okay, we're gonna forget songwriting... more guitar! More keyboards! More drums! More percussion! More overdubs! More bizarre noises! No, no, MORE of it! Let's try to make this the loudest, nastiest, least listenable record of all time!\\" And when it came to \\"least listenable ever\\", they didn't QUITE pull it off (that title would go to the Byrds' Dr. Byrds and Mr. Hyde). Black Satin is just awful. It's not a song. It's just a mess of noise panning from one speaker to the other. And it's the BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM! Now, that's only because it's the shortest: I'd much rather hear it than On the Corner or Mr. Freedom X, which both do the same thing for twenty minutes. And I like longer songs, if they're done well (B*tches Brew itself, Shh/Peaceful, In A Silent Way/It's About That Time, Right Off, What I Say, Zimbabwe, All Blues, Sid's Ahead and Walkin' being examples from the Miles catalogue). What I don't like is twenty minutes of what my ears consider equal to the audio recording of a monkey mud wrestling match. That doesn't fly.<br />Let nobody say I don't like Miles Davis, because I'll tell you right now, Kind of Blue, 'Round About Midnight and In a Silent Way are three total essential beautiful masterpieces. I just don't like On the Corner. I hate it with a passion, in fact. I've heard it described as a love-it-or-loathe -it deal - in fact, by 1972 Miles' audience was already cut down to fusionheads and devotees who would praise anything he put out, and this managed to hack some of them off. I hear this as everything that could've gone wrong with fusion going wrong.<br />Just so you know, I'm not a jazz purist - I like rock and funk, among other genres, quite a lot. And I think that In A Silent Way (along with the good halves of Jack Johnson and B*tches Brew) were the only times that Miles succeeded in doing good things with those two genres.say I don't like Miles Davis, because I'll tell you right now, Kind of Blue, 'Round About Midnight and In a Silent Way are three total essential beautiful masterpieces.

B0007Y89ZM|5.0|This DVD has been rented from my local public library many times within my family so I finally decided to just go buy it!      This show is quite something especially when you consider it was made in '94.  The Eagles were a solid group before and as Joe Walsh brings out, they still \\"show they can rock\\" on this DVD.  There are multiple audio selections and the visuals are all very appropriate.  The camera angles allow you to see much of the group throughout and you never really miss seeing the solos.  That's something I particularly enjoy after seeing a lot of recorded shows where the camera switches to the drummer when the guitar player is noodling, or vica versa.    All around I give this DVD five stars because of how truly clean, entertaining, and even relaxing it is.  If I were to relate the quality of this to any other DVD I own it would be to the Diana Krall: Live in Paris DVD.

0525948023|5.0|We become self- and earth-destructive, by clinging to and defending our ego-based interpretations of who we are. The price we pay for identifying with our past, our roles, our things, our relationships, he says, is frustration, addiction, conflicts and, ultimately, wars. He bemoans the loss of the joy of \\"just being,\\" and suggests ways to begin the hard work of shedding the falsehoods of the ego, beginning by naming them.  As always, Tolle is readable, challenging, alarming.
B00006RCNW|5.0|The Shield is without a doubt one of the best TV drama shows ever made.  The ensemble cast is extraordinary.  In addition, several superstars, such as Glenn Close and Forest Whittaker, were on for an entire season.  The writing is excellent, with many plot twists and turns that makes for an engrossing storyline.  The character development gives each member of the cast a very complex persona.  There are very few television shows I am addicted to and The Shield is one of them.
B000R7I3LY|5.0|Sara Bareilles' CD, 'Little Voice,' is one of the best CDs my ears have had the pleasure of listening to.  Every song is flawless, a task which I thought impossible because I had become so attached to all of her old renditions of these songs.  For those hesitant in how the new sound is, don't be.  She takes these songs and changes them, they grow and morph into (while not necessarily better) amazIng works of art.  'Love Song' is one of the best 'jump-around-summer-songs' I've heard of late, and 'Gravity' will put tears in your eyes with its beauty and simplicity.  'Vegas' is a song I can play over and over, while 'Between the Lines' (the only song I had not heard before buying the album) is a somber and tragic song.  And while 'Fairytale' may never sound as good as it does with only Sara and her piano, this new version fits very nicely with this perfect album.  Sara's words are strong, her voice phenomenal, and her piano skills abundant, and this album is the perfect testament to the sheer beauty of everything that is Sara Bareilles.  Is it too soon to be anticipating her next album?

B0000542D2|4.0|Having not watched this film in about ten years, getting reacquainted with it recently was almost like discovering it for the very first time all over again.  The cinematography is beautiful (the early Beatles just seem to exist in black and white; it's very hard for me to picture them in color at this point in their career), the songs are terrific, the film really brings to life just what Beatlemania was like, with those hoardes of screaming young girls chasing their idols, and in spite of not having that much of a plot, the story is carried through very well by its young stars.  In spite of not having been professional actors, The Beatles just have so much charm, wit, and vibrancy in this picture, back before they became weary of so much touring and all of those screaming fans, back when it was still all new, fun, and exciting to them.  They were all so young and good-looking in this film!  And being from this early stage of their fame, one gets a genuine sense of them being almost like four brothers who care about one another and enjoy one another's company, a far cry from the tension and acrimony present in LIB.  At times it doesn't even feel like they were using a script, but that they were just ad-libbing most of it and acting like they would have in real life, four crazy, fun, and ultimately caring good young men dealing with the pressures of fame as best they could.<br /><br />However, this DVD release leaves a whole lot to be desired.  Disc one has a documentary of sorts, which is nothing more than a collection of interviews from people involved in the making of the film, and disc two is entirely taken up with interviews from all sorts of people who were involved in the making of the film.  While there are some genuinely nice interviewees, such as George Martin, Klaus Voorman, David Jaxon (who played the young boy), and director Richard Lester, most of them aren't from such high-profile people; indeed, some of the interviews can be rather boring, and don't give us any real new information.  Who, for example, wants to see an interview with Betty Glasow, their hairdresser, over, I don't know, an interview with an actual Beatle?  Some of the interviewees mention deleted scenes, but we're not even shown any of them.  While they're interesting to watch once, they're not something that most fans are going to want to see over and over again.  Where are actually substantial bonus features like trailers, newsreels, the making-of documentary \\"You Can't Do That,\\" the aforementioned deleted scenes, photo galleries, galleries of PR material, or an audio commentary?  It's inexcusable that such a wonderful and famous film gets the short end of the stick in this rereleased format.  The lacking bonus features aren't the only downside, either; the film is shown in phony widescreen, with the wrong aspect ratio, and therefore portions of the picture are cropped out.  And while I normally find excessive complaints about audio quality to be sheer pedantry, complaining about relatively minor things that normal people don't really notice or care about to such a huge degree, even I noticed that there was something a bit off about the sound, particularly when it came to the songs.  Additionally, the front cover almost looks like the cover of a bootleg.  Whatever happened to the original cover design?<br /><br />This is still a fun charming film after all of these years, but it really deserved better packaging and treatment.  One would be better-served searching out the original DVD release, which had better bonus features, sound, and aspect ratio, or, if one can still find it, the older CD-ROM which I feel lucky to possess, which also gives the film the respect it deserves.

B000002UAR|5.0|This has been my favorite Beatles' album for years and years and years, as well as one of my top favorite albums overall.  While of course some of the techniques used on certain of the songs aren't going to seem as revolutionary or current as they were back in 1966, that doesn't change the fact that at the time, they were very radical innovations, helped to change the face of pop music, and really marked the beginning of The Beatles' mature period.  By this point they'd finally fully graduated from doing just love songs and simplistic pop to dealing with weightier subjects, and using a greater amount of studio experimentation, such as the backwards guitar in \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" and the tape loops sounding like exotic birds in \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\"  Overall, I'd have to say that it's quite possibly their best album, maybe even the one that's stood the test of time the best (even allowing for how some aspects of the music may seem dated to some people today, it doesn't come across like some horribly dated period piece either).  Every song is just so great; it really just seems like the epitome of perfection, the type of album one could listen to several times in a row or every day and not get bored of or skip any tracks on (though I must admit I don't really care for \\"For No One\\").  As great as they were, how many other albums did they make that one could say were truly as perfect as this one?  One can also easily understand why this has been called their acid album.<br /><br />Another great thing about this album is how balanced it is.  While on some albums, one Beatle predominates (such as how John sings lead on 9 of the 13 tracks on AHDN and half of the songs on RS), here it's much more distributed.  John and Paul each sing 5 songs, with the requisite Ringo song (\\"Yellow Submarine,\\" one of his most famous), and the remaining three songs, including the opening one, going to George.  Apart from the White Album where he had 4 songs, such a relatively generous amount of songs would never happen again.  One can tell from these three songs that he was really growing and maturing as a songwriter even this early into having become the band's third songwriter.  The musical styles themselves are also rather balanced; there are soft songs like \\"Here, There, and Everywhere,\\" fun meaningless pop like \\"And Your Bird Can Sing,\\" social commentary songs like \\"Eleanor Rigby,\\" the Indian-influenced \\"Love You To\\" (one of my favorite tracks), partially autobiographical songs like \\"She Said She Said,\\" and songs with a strong psychedelic influence, like the hypnotic \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\" (probably my favorite track) and the closing track \\"Tomorrow Never Knows.\\"  I won't even get into people who are genuinely wondering why this isn't the Capitol repackaging they remember from childhood; I can't imagine this album without such key tracks as \\"Dr. Robert\\" and \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" and am baffled as to why anyone would find the repackagings to be superior to the authentic British originals other than sentimental reasons.<br /><br />Overall, this album is the perfect midway point between their early, more innocent period and their later, more serious period, a transitional bridge between the two eras.

0143038419|1.0|Being absurdly coy about the reasons surrounding her spectacular divorce flameout, Gilbert makes it impossible for the reader to empathize or sympathize with her desperate need for self-discovery. Mostly, she just sounds like every woman who's been through a bad time and obsesses about a guy. And yes, it can be bad but hardly worth a book. Worse, however, is her insistence in romanticizing the non-Western Other--Indians and Balinese are reduced to stereotyped portals to her self-awakening. In the end, she may have achieved perceived enlightenment but she certainly seems just as blinkered as she was when she started.
1594489505|5.0|I have been awakened by \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns.\\"  If one is able to read this book without transforming in some way, that particular person is without a pulse.    This story is about oppression, terror, bondage, love, and friendship. It is a story of two women, who find one another in the midst of chaotic circumstances, and in those circumstances, discover a glimmer of hope, discover `a thousand splendid suns.'    Muriam and Laila are married to the same man or should I say the same devil.  In a place where women have fewer rights dogs, I found myself thanking God for my freedom, and at the same time feeling guilty for that same freedom and guilty of my ignorance of not knowing about the traumatic struggle of Afghan women. When one knows - one must do, or this is the greatest sin of all.    When the Taliban rule Afghanistan, these are some of the rules they decide women need to abide by:    1. Women will not be on the streets without being accompanied by a man.  If they are, they will be beaten.  2. Women will not work. If they do, they will be beaten.  3. Women will be covered from head to toe.  If they are not, they will be beaten.  4. Women will leave all colleges and schools.

B000059Z8J|3.0|I've never really been that fussed about seeing this film before - as a child (OK, and now) I was mad about Lois & Clark: New Adventures Of Superman, with Dean Cain & Teri Hatcher, and am now collecting the DVDs. (I've never seen Smallville yet - probably not a good idea to get started on that one, I've still got loads of others to watch.) People have always said, the first actor you see playing a certain role, will never compare to anyone else. Up until now, I didn't think anyone but Dean Cain could play Superman.<br /><br />How wrong I was. After watching this film (and buying Superman II and Superman Returns), I have to say I love Christopher Reeve as Superman. Not only does he fill the suit rather well, he's hotter than Dean Cain (can't believe I once spent a \\"Bring Your Daughter To Work Day\\" trawling the internet at my Dad's work looking for photos of him!), and he brings a whole new dimension to the character of Clark Kent. With Dean, he was just a guy in glasses, with almost exactly the same hair. Christopher turns Clark into a bumbling idiot, who seems to be out of sorts with everything around him, and parts his hair on a different side, whether he's Clark or Superman.<br /><br />I certainly hope the second movie starts with more of a bang than this one did. Just over an hour before we actually get to see Christopher as Superman. I hated the beginning, and really was going to switch it off, but thankfully, I didn't. It was just way too much, and what Marlon Brando got paid was absolutely shocking. He got paid $3.7 million, and as if that wasn't enough, he also got a percentage of the profits for playing Jor-El for 12 (TWELVE) shooting days. The fee (plus the percentage) also covered the sequel, which was being simultaneously shot with the original. He didn't appear in the sequel however, as he was involved in a lawsuit over non-payment of his profit-participation for the original movie. He ultimately received about $14 million for his ten minutes on film. ($14 MILLION).<br /><br />I wasn't keen on Margot Kidder's interpretation of Lois Lane. I loved Teri Hatcher's version of the character, but wasn't so keen on this one. She seemed to scream at every opportunity, and certainly played the traditional damsel in distress character, which was very grating. Teri certainly didn't do that - she gave Lois Lane (to put it politely) balls, who didn't need a guy in tights to save her.<br /><br />The film was excellent, and I was shocked at the quality of the CGI, during the flying sequences - but in a good way. I seriously expected the CGI to be worse than it was, particularly for a film made in 1978. I only noticed the CGI a couple of times, but I've seen it a lot worse in other films. I was very impressed, as I was expecting to notice it a lot.<br /><br />Christopher Reeve certainly had talent, and it showed in this. He's so hot too! It's such a shame what has happened since, and it still makes me sad thinking about it. In my opinion, he's definitely the best Superman, and I doubt that will change when I watch Superman Returns. (Although Brandon Routh could have been his twin, they look pretty similar!)<br /><br />Overall, I was really impressed with this film, although I think it could have been better in parts, but Christopher's performance more than makes up for that. I look forward to seeing the second, and then I might make a decision about the third & fourth. But then again, I might just buy it for Christopher. He's definitely hot. Even if he does wear tights, and his underwear on the outside.I wasn't keen on Margot Kidder's interpretation of Lois Lane.

0385340559|5.0|There are very few books I pick up and can't put down... read 'em in a day. This one, like the other Jack Reacher books, is a hit. It is a great thriller, keeps you guessing, and pulls you in to Jack's character. Highly recommended. I also like Douglas Preston/Lincoln Child's Pendergast books! Great characters and great writing. Lee Child and Preston/Linc.Child never disappoint.
0753820250|5.0|This novel is one of those queer modern European gothics where the supernatural is explained away at the denouement, but never quite to the reader's satisfaction. Meanwhile through the bulk of the novel, supernatural devices are applied with a lavish hand: a haunted house; a man with no face; a cemetery of forgotten books; and characters who might or might not be dead.<br /><br />If you like novels that explore horror without giving themselves completely up to ghosts, vampires, and werewolves, \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" is a walloping good read. It is of the same old-fashioned genre as Ann Radcliffe's \\"The Mysteries of Udolpho,\\" a type of novel that I thought had been parodied out of existence by Jane Austen's \\"Northanger Abbey.\\" However, with \\"The Shadow of the Wind,\\" Carlos Ruiz Zaf&oacute;n has succeeded in bringing the gothic back to life in the twenty-first century. It creaks ominously along, subplots resurrecting within plots like the multiplying corpses in \\"Night of the Living Dead.\\"<br /><br />The first-person narrator is a ten-year-old boy whose father changes his life by taking him to the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. The boy, Daniel has already had a difficult life, as his mother died of cholera during the Spanish Civil War, and his home town of Barcelona has still not healed from that bloody conflict when this book begins in the summer of 1945.<br /><br />Along with the usual problems puberty brings, Daniel's choice of book from the Cemetery of Forgotten Books, titled \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" brings him unwelcome attention from a man whose face has been burned beyond recognition.<br /><br />The characters in this book are finely drawn and totally ingratiating. I was so afraid my favorite character (a man who had spent some very non-quality time in Franco's prison system) was going to be killed, I almost didn't finish reading this book. However, the friend who pressed \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\" on me swore she'd never give me another book if I didn't finish this one, so I kept on reading.<br /><br />It was a totally satisfying experience. As is said about the book within this book, \\"...the tale sinks into a tragic, darkly perfumed gothic denouement.\\"<br /><br />At least my favorite character experiences a happy ending.It was a totally satisfying experience.

B00005JN2Z|5.0|Tom Cruise does a fantastic job as a hired assassin who travels to Los Angeles to do some people in.  The key to this tactic is that he holds a cab driver hostage so that he can be carried from target to target with relative ease.  Within the film the cab driver named Max (Jamie Fox) keeps his wits about him while at the same time getting into some psychological and philosophical discussions with Vince (Cruise), as Vince almost seems like a friend at times to Max.  Mark Ruffalo is also good cast as Detective Fanning, a perceptive investigator who can view the pieces of the puzzle but not quite put them all together, although he is farther ahead than the Feds, who realize too late that witnesses related to a case they are working on are being killed off one by one in a single night.  Jade Pinkett Smith is also in the film and has a key role, so just fasten your seatbelt and crank the volume as Max and Vince roll out into the night!  What can I say; director Michael Mann sure does know how to produce an action packed crime film!

B0000028M7|5.0|While other people were noting the rise of bands like Pearl Jam and Nirvana, the band I felt that was the new great \\"rock\\" if you will, was Alice in Chains.  Dirt was the 2nd album they had and it has so many songs on it I like I could talk about them forever.  With Dirt I just felt like it was good in all aspects, but especially songwriting.  Staley and Cantrell are in sync here till the end, and despite the death of Layne a few years ago I still think they had enough albums to solidify themselves for a higher status than so many other bands that seemed to be riding the grunge train later in the 1990's like Silverchair and Creed.  Rooster is my favorite song; it is so dark and powerful like most of the material found here, but also because it was a tribute from Cantrell to his father who fought in the Vietnam War.  I still go back and enjoy listening to this album often, I just wish Layne could have stayed with us but I am happy for the great material this band produced during their tenure.
B000A88EVE|4.0|The Man Who Fell to Earth is a science fiction cult film from director Nicolas Roeg (Walkabout, Don't Look Now).  It stars David Bowie as an alien who visits Earth seeking water for his home world which is barren.  It is based on the Walter Tevis novel of the same name and this Criterion release of The Man Who Fell to Earth comes with the book as well.  There are significant enough differences between the novel and the film that the novel is a worthy supplement to the experience of watching this movie.  You will also want to check out the DVD extras in the same regard.<br /><br />David Bowie is the title character in his only feature role. He is Thomas Newton and he only has to adjust his appearance a little bit to look somewhat human.  That is if you think David Bowie even looks human because I don't, but I do realize he is...I think?  Anyway, Thomas Newton rises to great wealth due to his society's advances in technology and his ability to create enterprises based on his patenting compilations of ideas that his world produced, nonexistent on Earth. He is trying of course to fund the shipment of water back to his home world.  Thomas soon meets Mary-Lou (played by Candy Clark).  Mary-Lou is your typical girl who introduces him to many of Earth's temptations.  Thomas is soon inhibited by his aberrant consumption of alcohol and his fixation with television.  It all has a very negative effect on him.  Mary-Lou and his friend Nathan (Rip Torn) both eventually discover separately that Thomas is indeed an alien.  After being revealed and after the government imprisons him, Thomas's inevitable downfall becomes apparent.  We see him gradually accept failure in his task and grow increasingly negative in his disposition.  He has truly fallen to Earth I suppose.<br /><br />The big strengths in this film are primarily its cinematography.  I like Nicholas Roeg's other films a lot so I'm aware that this is to be expected.  I like the idea of a science fiction art film and overall I can really appreciate the fact that The Man Who Fell to Earth is not as in your face as most science fiction is today and was even back then in the mid 70s.  However, this is almost too surreal and sedated for me.  It was convincing but there were some long and boring stretches and I couldn't figure out why exactly, beyond the photography alone.  It just seemed a lot longer than the story warranted.  Also, I think I can draw the line between gratuitous nudity and appropriate nudity and I'm grown up enough to accept both.  The Man Who Fell to Earth has much gratuitous nudity, but that was a sign of the times I guess so it's partially forgivable. There is more emotion and drive behind Newton in the Tevis novel and it seemed a bit more controlled as an existential piece of work.  It doesn't matter though because with the Criterion release you are getting both and if you like to collect interesting and unique films that will have you talking then this set is worth owning.  The film itself would probably get three stars from me but the Criterion release justifies four.  It really is an exceptional package.  The extras are outstanding and should help answer most questions you will have.  Provoking movies like this one, whether they be good or bad, deserve the royal treatment so kudos to Criterion once again.appreciate the fact that The Man Who Fell to Earth is not as in your face as most science fiction is today and was even back then in the mid 70s.

1594489505|4.0|I had anxiously awaited this book because I enjoyed THE KITE RUNNER so much.  I was NOT disappointed.  Khaled Hosseini tells this story with such rich images, tempo and insight.  A THOUSAND SPLENDID SUNS intrigued me because it told the story of women in Afghanistan and how so many are still treated as mere possessions.  Women of Afghanistan remain such a mystery to many of us in the Western world that this peek into their society was both fascinating and disturbing. Hosseini managed to take the reader through some horribly violent scenes and still bring us around to appreciate the number of love stories he  intermingled from start to finish.  Enjoy this splendid book!
B000Q6GUTI|4.0|Mark Wahlberg is great in this movie about a sniper who worked for the government being called out of retirement, allegedly to do a job in the interests of national security. Something goes awry, and suddenly Wahlberg's character (Swagger)is a fugitive. There is a nice plot here with a well-timed twist.  There is also plenty of action with car chases, gun fights and explosions galore. It ends in a most satisfying way. Danny Glover and Michael Pena also star, and give solid performances.

B000OYC3J8|5.0|After skipping the White Stripes last album, because of its apparent lack of guitar, I was eager to hear the new one. Having read that Jack White the guitar hero was back in full force, I eagerly picked up Icky Thump. I was not at all disappointed. The album is fantastic. Yes, Jack's guitar is back! The album is loud, it rocks and the songs are great. All of them. There's nary a weak track here. In addition to guitar, the songs also incorporate bagpipes (!!!), old-school Univox synthesizers and a mariachi trumpet. If you like the White Stripes or just good rock music in general, Icky Thump is very worthwhile.
630587493X|4.0|All of you testosterone junkies beware. There is NO action in Bicentennial Man. None whatsoever. My guess is the action buffs would call this movie a chick flick because of the lack of violence and focus on emotional development. I pity you poor slobs for being so narrow minded. Bicentennial Man is like an autobiography. With that in mind the movie makes perfect sense and achieves what it sets out to do.     First lets get to the sci-fi stuff. The movie is supposed to open in the year 2005, which is roughly five years after the movie was made. No idea why they decided on just a short time. Obviously we never developed positronic brains and fully self-capable robots, but that's just nit picking. Add a couple of decades to the movie's timeline and all is well. The android technology was well done and believable. Also the 'upgrades' that Andrew (the android) does during his lifetime tend to be believable as well. Not much other tech stuff in the movie. You'll see a hover car here and some fancy tools there, but for the most part the technology in this movie is focused on the androids.    Because the movie's timeline covers about 200 years (thus the movie title) character development for the humans have been sped up, but not to the point to where you don't see it. There are a few one dimensional or static characters in the movie. The important characters fortunately aren't. Bicentennial Man is about character development by the way. It's about how Andrew becomes more and more human and how the humans around him adjust to how much he evolves.     The acting was well done of course. I have to give notice to child actress Hallie Kate Eisenberg for doing a great job as the youngest of the Martin family children. The movie is full of beautiful scenes both natural and technological. One thing that bugged me was there were some breathtaking futuristic cityscapes in Bicentennial Man, but they don't show any of them until much later in the movie. That tends to make the movie unbalanced as far as imagery is concerned.     If you like dramas then Bicentennial Man will hit the spot. If you like epics then you should be able to get something out of this movie too. It also makes a good date movie since it also involves love and relationships and all that mushy stuff. For the average science fiction fan as long as you're not all freaky about things having to blow up or anything like that then you too will enjoy Bicentennial Man.

B0000042GM|5.0|It's a good thing I waited to write this until I'd heard these CDs a few times.  I would have been guilty of understatement.  Katchen's work grows on me in much the same way Brahms' music itself does.  It is rich in nuance and insight, and never fails to please.<br /><br />I'll confess, I bought this set to fill the gaps in my piecemeal collection.  What a delightful surprise to find my \\"stopgap\\" set more than holds its own against recordings by the likes of Richter, Rubinstein and Gilels.  To help the reader overcome any reluctance I offer a few comments on the few \\"downsides\\" mentioned by others:<br /><br />Yes, Katchen does play fast, but not always, and certainly not out of inability to hold the listener's attention through more artful means.  Katchen's track times are often slower than Rubinstein's or even Gilels'; but where the spirit moves him, he can go like a rocket.  He's generally fastest in the earlier works, where a case can be made for playing them with youthful ardor;  Katchen does this to a T.  This applies to the first 2 sonatas, the Paganini variations (why would anything associated with Paganini lack splash and dazzle?) and to a much lesser extent, parts of the Handel variations. The main thing is, it works.  The very few places where I felt Katchen was rushing the music are heavily outnumbered by places where the added energy seems to \\"fit\\" like a glove.<br /><br />Yes, in an exhaustive set you inevitably endure the \\"bottom of the barrel.\\"  I'm surprised how little of this 6-CD set strikes me as anything less than indispensible.  Every track is worth hearing. Katchen has been surpassed here and there, but he doesn't put in a bad performance in the whole batch.<br /><br />Yes, the recordings are more than 40 years old. They will not satisfy the most jaded audiophile (there's not quite the \\"presence\\" of a good recording today).  But they are amazingly clean and lifelike for their age (even the 3 tracks that are mono). They sound noticeably better than the popular Rubinstein recordings of equal vintage. At first I thought I heard a touch of bass-heaviness, but now I just think Katchen gives us a strong, clear bass line.  Once again, it works.  The sound is simply not a problem for a normal listener.<br /><br />Finally, there's the small stuff.  Getting the CDs out of their tight-fitting sleeves without putting your fingerprints on the playing surface is well-nigh impossible, unless you give in and apply a letter opener to solve the problem once and for all.  Is that any reason not to get this much wonderful music at such a low price?  London has even revived the old practice of offering different program notes in different languages, so that multilingual readers can benefit from more than one set of comments.  All around it's a winner!

I highly recommend this CD to anyone - Irish or not.
B00005JPFE|3.0|Here's the thing - I couldn't get past this movie's premise of humans lapping up delicious dishes dished out by a rat, that too when the rat looks no where like a sanitized Mickey Mouse but is as living and breathing as the ones that run amuck in some cinema halls' aisles. As Remy, the rat, says in his own words quoting a famous chef that is, \\"Anybody can cook, but that doesn't mean anybody should cook\\". Not definitely rodents, right? But if you manage to look past this inconvenient thought, all kind of possibilities to enjoy the movie open up. The animation is first-rate, the voices are very good and the story is feel-good.    Remy teams up with Linguini, a former garbageman, to become a chef; Linguini takes care of the most important thing a chef needs, the human look, while Remy takes care of the next important thing, ability to cook. What helps is the fact that Linguini is a human puppet, his hair strands fill in as strings helping Remy make him do the right moves. Enroute to becoming a famous chef, there is an evil boss to be taken care of, a redoubtable food critic and a girl to please.     And the scene that takes the cake is when Food critic is to be pleased. The rats forming an assembly line, Remy giving Ratatouille his touch and its delicious look, Linguini doing a roller-skate serving, the food critic with the first bite remembering his mom's cooking and dropping his critical ink-pen on the floor - all of it, is pure magic. Brad Bird knows how to keep animations animated to keep the viewer glued to onscreen happenings, he did it admirably well with The Incredibles, and he does it again - though not to the same degree- with Ratatouille.    While I never wondered in earlier pixar movies as to whether fish, toys, bugs, cars or monsters could do the things they wonderfully did, somehow in this movie the question 'can rats do all these?' kept coming to me. If that didn't happen, I would have enjoyed the movie much more that I did.

1594489505|5.0|I thought this book was great. I was skeptical as to whether it would live up to the drama and emotion of Kite Runner but I will have to say it most definitely did.  Hosseini is such a great story teller.  Once you think one thing is happening there is a complete twist within the next paragraph.  I thought the author did a great job in developing the characters while also giving a good backstory detailing the hardships and difficulties of living through war in Afghanistan.      I love a book with strong female characters and Mariam and Laila proved to be two exceptional heroines.  I strongly recommend this book.

Probably not as well known as other Genesis work, but still, for me, evocative of a different time.  Definitely enjoyable.
B0006L16N8|3.0|This is not a bad album.  However, it is not a great album either.  I am a Coldplay fan.  I thought both Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head were very good albums, particularly a Rush of Blood, which didn't have a really bad track on it.  X&Y is not of the same caliber.  I admit that I really liked some of the tracks on X&Y--particularly Fix You, A Message, The Hardest Part, and Til Kingdom Come.  However, it had at least one track that I absolutely hated, Twisted Logic, and a number of others that just seemed like filler and all blend together for me.  I can't say exactly what went wrong with this album--only that something did.    Encouragingly, some of the best songs associated with this album are the B-sides, in particular Proof and The World Turned Upside Down. So, I have some confidence that Coldplay can right the ship with their next album.  I give X&Y a half-hearted recommendation, but if you don't own any Coldplay albums, don't let this be the first one.  Purchase A Rush of Blood and Parachutes first, and if you absolutely love them, go for this one.    Finally, I would simply ignore all of the Radiohead fanboys who constantly rip Coldplay.  I love Radiohead, in my view one of the best bands of the past 20 years.  But I'm not so foolish as to think that no other band can make great music, including a band that is heavily influenced by Radiohead.  There is no doubt that Coldplay's music, especially Parachutes, was influenced by The Bends and OK Computer.  But if you can listen to OK Computer without hearing the influence of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds, Miles Davis or the Beatles, then you haven't listened to enough music in your lifetime.  The short story is, Coldplay stand on their own just fine without being accused of being completely derivative of Radiohead.
0312323867|4.0|`Something Blue' is fantastic!  As we all know, sequels are generally pretty lame, but not this one. `Something Blue' picks up where [[ASIN:0312321198 Something Borrowed]] leaves off, and through the fabulous, witty writing of Emily Giffin, we get to again enjoy the lives of these vivid characters.<br /><br />As it begins, we are re-introduced to Darcy, the self-absorbed, spoiled rotten, manipulative friend of Rachel's, who is also Dex's ex-fianc&eacute;. Initially I thought, \\"How am I going to make it through this book listening to her tinny whining?\\" But Emily Giffin's shining narrative moves so seamlessly, you suddenly realize after reading for a few hours that you're halfway through the book. The story line impeccably flows to all the right places, and I was amazed by how fresh it was. Giffin gives Rachel relatively little voice in this book, and I think Giffin was brilliant in writing her first novel from one person's perspective and the second from the other's, because NOW we have the full story- one from each side. None of the writing seems hackneyed or old; it is all very inventive and original. Not giving a thing away, Darcy's character does change into something more appealing, and even though the story might not go where you think it is going to go, there is a wonderful ending, packaged in a big box with a beautiful bow. Emily Giffin really is asserting herself as a dynamic new writer of \\"chick-lit\\" and someone to be reckoned with.

0743454537|5.0|I picked up My Sister's Keeper due to the subject matter of adolescent cancer.  As a pediatric nurse who works with teens with cancer, I can first of all say that the medical details in this book are quite authentic.  The emotions of the character with cancer and her family are ones I have heard expressed numerous times.  The book gave me an even better picture of what these people must be going through.  Although in most cases, a sibling is not asked to make the sacrifices that Anna does, too many times, siblings of kids with cancer get pushed to the background while their parents focus is centered on the sick child.  This book touches on those issues without trying to fix the problem or offer any answers...it just makes the reader think...and to recognize that so much is so far from black or white.    The book make me smile and made me cry.  But more importantly, it made me think....oncologists and nurses are gaining an increased awareness for the need to treat the entire family when a child is sick.....My Sister's Keeper drove that point home poignantly.    This was the first Jodi Picoult book I read.  I have since finished Perfect Match.  The author has a gift for bringing up difficult issues, presenting  the reader with a depth of information and feelings, and then letting them decide what they think and how they feel.  I look forward to reading more of Ms. Picoult's novels
B000002LFZ|5.0|This is an excellent Fleetwood Mac compilations.  I won't bother listing good songs, because most all are good.  The album as a whole is in the vein of lite rock or pop/rock, so somebody who likes their music a bit harder might find this a bit fluffy.  Because of that, I was actually fence sitting between 4 and 5 stars but was feeling generous and went with 5.  Because the album is just so listenable.  Very good collection.

I like David Caruso and think he is a great actor, but why he signed up for this I don't know.  Obviously once again I missed something with all the good reviews this film got, maybe I fell asleep again !!
0316018953|5.0|Michael Connelly is simply the best in a field with very few hacks these days.I write in this genre, too, but I do not compare.  In addition, I have been a federal agent, a criminal investigator, as well as a public defender investigator. This is a preface to remark on how accurate Connelly is (rarely so in fiction), and how close to the actual \\"feeling\\" of the real thing he comes with his characters. I know he was a crime reporter, but this guy knows people in the life who trust him, and who inform him from the most ragged center of those in the business. And last, this guy can write. It may be a genre, but this is also mainstream American Novel writing.    Philip Shelton
0812971825|5.0|I've just read Abide with Me a second time to see if I still loved it three years later.<br /><br />I do!  Perhaps you have to live in a small town to really appreciate these characters, with their fragility and opinions and intrigues, but having just come from a church planning luncheon, they all seem delightfully familiar to me.<br /><br />Minister Tyler Caskey has lost his wife, and struggles to regain his faith and footing during the increasingly troubled days of a New England winter.  The members of his congregation don't make it easy for him.  The omniscient narrator shines a glaring light on each of the central characters, laying bare the troubled pasts and emotional needs that motivate them.  You have the kindergarten teacher who calls a conference to discuss Tyler's troubled daughter, expecting to be lauded as a saint for putting up with the child, and who gossips endlessly about Tyler when he reacts defensively.  You have the counselor who, lit with her new discovery of Freud, attempts to explain the child's \\"infantile grandiosity.\\"  You have the choir leader, who uses her campaign for a new pipe organ to mask her heartache over a troubled marriage.  You have the church deacon who wrestles daily with his obsession over a shocking sexual relationship outside his marriage.<br /><br />You may come to dislike some of these characters, but in the end, they come together in such surprising ways as a lifeline of grace.  Perhaps it's almost too much to hope for, that flawed people could discover and act on their best natures, but it's certainly what I hope for in my own life:  that in the end, as Tyler explains it, love will be served.<br /><br />Abide with Me is a graceful, lyrical, and sometimes shocking little book.  You'll be riveted by Book 3, wondering how these threads can all possibly resolve, and I promise that you will find quite a few surprises in those last chapters.<br /><br />Highly recommended, and if, like me, you come away worried about one unresolved story thread about the Slatins, come back to this review and drop me a line.tins, come back to this review and drop me a line.

B000E41MS6|5.0|The new Doctor Who series has a bigger budget and better writing than the past generations and it's tons of fun!  Christopher Eccleston in the 1st series as the Doctor is FANTASTIC.  Great action packed stories that are lots of fun to watch.  If you never understood the British cult of Doctor Who previously, this new series will hook you.    In the second series, David Tennant's Doctor is just a bit melodramtic nutsy with a tinge of mushy humanism (a few too many diatribes about the magnificance of the human race).  But still worth watching!
159562015X|4.0|This book was spot on in 'getting me'.  I did the analysis and my wife said, 'wow, they got you perfectly.'  The book is relatively short, and I would have liked more learning, but I would definitely recommend it.

1416523359|5.0|The first fifty pages, I thought maybe this book was going to be a dud.  It started with zero momentum.  The second 50 started to revive my interest.  But by the end of the book, I felt that this one one of the author's finest works.  Maybe it's the pairing of a more mature author and an experienced reader that allows for a book that does not rush things, that takes it's time and savors the journey.    It is a book not confined to single genre.  Those wanting only the adrenaline of terror and thrills may be frustrated, but for those who enjoy a well told tale of any kind, it turns out to be a wonderful blend of realtionships, retrospective, interior exploration and, yes, of course, imagination and suspense.  To weave such a diverse, wonderful pattern in a single narrative is a high acheivement.  Bravo!
B000NA28I4|1.0|I got this DVD in the combo deal for preview DVDs of Blockbuster: buy 2 get 2 free. I got this together with Pirate 2: Deadman's chest, Ice Age 2, and Happy Feet, all for $30 before tax. Had I read reviews here, I'd not waste time on this. The only thing I can say about this is BAD, BAD and BAD. If you want to view it, better rent it than buy. The actings were horrible, especially the main character Eragon. The guy smiled so much that it's annoying. If you saw Dragon's heart, and LOTR before, you will see a poor immitation in this flick. The special effect is not very much special. The directing is really poor. Remember the grand battle in LOTR: 2 Towers? You'll find something similar here but in a smaller scale and dumber. Why dumber? You'll find a scene when Eragon let his dragon fire everywhere on the ground as she's flying. Of course, lots of enemies are destroyed, but what about the allies engaging in the battle? Not only the screenplay was bad, the ending is really disappointing too! You'll ask yourself, \\"That's it?!?\\", since it does not end with an answer or a mystery that leaves a big question mark in your curiousity. It's more like the end of part one, and there'll a sequence (I hope not!).  The DVD was poorly made, not much special feature. I use closed caption of my TV not the DVD, but it did not cap right. This film is only worth for Sci-fi channel. Actors in this films will be in my No-No list.

B0000A02TZ|5.0|I have a dirty little secret.  I hate to admit it, but I will just for you folks:  I only recently finally watched ANIMAL HOUSE for the first time.  I realize it's been on T.V. a zillion times, but I always deliberately missed it because I have a serious issue with censorship.  If I'm going to watch a movie, I want to watch it EXACTLY the way it was supposed to be shown as opposed to some watered-down version that has been edited with a hack-saw.<br /><br />So, finally, I got around to watching it  /  buying it.  And, it was GREAT!  Like a fine wine, it was worth waiting for.  This is one of the pioneering movies of the party movie genre.  In fact, it could even be considered the grand-daddy of them all!<br /><br />ANIMAL HOUSE set the standard for everything that the best party films have to offer:  raunchy humor, lots of males flunking out of college, an eccentric professor (or two), a sneak-peek @ the frat house milieu, an utter dis-respect for authority and (most importantly for me), lots of gratuitious nudity!  If you watch pretty much ANY party movie today, you will readily see the influence of AH.  The best ones took the best parts of AH and went off into different directions, while the worst party movies merely tried to rehash aspects of AH in a generic fashion.<br /><br />There is no question that party movies are not for everyone.  If any of the above offends you, you most assuredly will do best to skip over this flick.  Nor would I recommend movies like AH to be used as didactic films.  Rather, party movies (to me) are kind of a catharsis in that the characters do actions which I would never do myself, but secretly have wanted to.<br /><br />On another topic, the cast contains quite a few actors who would become big names, such as John Belushi (this is the role he's typically most known for), Kevin Bacon, Donald Sutherland and Karen Allen.  For the sake of nostalgia alone this film is worth a look.  Just remember:  it's OK to visit Animal House every so often - just be sure you don't decide to live there!on't decide to live there!

B0009IW9DE|5.0|Lonesome Jubilee is my favorite Mellencamp CD. I turn it up loud and and lose myself in the Americana, the earthy every-man stories that blue collar folks can relate to immediately. John's ability to tell stories of real people that you can actually visualize is his best talent. Whenever I listen to this CD, I am struck with the emotional depth and musical expertise of every musician playing in every cut.  I wore out my first copy, so I bought another one. IF you think you don't like Mellencamp, but have never heard this one, give it a real listen. This one and Scarecrow might change your mind.
B0000070QN|5.0|I somehow had overlooked this band,as have most people in the states.But,after trading cd's with a friend from California,he turned me on to these guys as well as Gotthard.

B000002AGN|5.0|This is a reissue of the 1959 studio session. Although Blue Rondo and Take Five are the signature pieces for the Quartet, the other tracks are in keeping with the innovative time signatures 5/4, 6/4 and variations of 4/4 and 3/4 time.  What else can you say except it's a classic and belongs in evryone's collection.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|A wonderful new album from Loreena. If you like her previous recordings, you will not be dissappointed.
B000OCXMAE|3.0|It's such a shame that LP had to go and tinker around with some new stuff like they did on the second half of this album. The 2 through 6 songs (Track #1 is better off in a video game or something), although different from what I've come to expect LP to sound like, are really good. I like the melodies, the catchy beats, fun choruses, etc, but it's definitely quite a bit softer than their standard fare. Maybe they're trying to break into the radio scene - on pop stations! I can listen to it, but it's not what I want to hear when I think \\"Linkin Park\\". Maybe movie soundtracks or something similar will be their 'raison de'tre'. I hope not.    5 Stars: \\"Given Up\\" and \\"What I've Done\\" are some of their best songs I've heard to date. On \\"Given Up\\": From the catchy opening clapping sound, then the rocking heavy metal beat that comes in, then to the screaming lyrics, this song reminds me of what Linkin Park would sound like if they melded with The Offspring. Cool and catchy all the way through. \\"What I've Done\\" is slower, but has a haunting Michael Myers' Halloween sound to it. Completely catchy and feels like Linkin Park to me.       4 Stars: \\"Leave Out All The Rest\\", \\"Bleed It Out\\", and \\"Shadow of the Day\\" are all good songs, but slower, and not as memorable as the 5 Stars.    The rest of the songs fall into that pit of \\"songs that I just don't want to listen to anymore\\" that keeps getting bigger and bigger from bands I like. It's depressing to me that so many bands think I want to hear their political views on various topics. At least if the music and/or lyrics are good (eg: Disturbed's \\"Ten Thousand Fists, or System of a Down's insanely addictive sound), I won't skip them when they come on. And it's not just the views that are different from mine. I am tired of hearing them ALL!! Wake up bands: You're losing fans because you can't just sing. Sing the music, sing the words, just stop politicking.     I've got my Windows Media Player set to skip Tracks 7 through 12; something I don't normally do to a CD, but there is nothing for me in the last 6 tracks. I hate to do it, but LP is now on my \\"Research before I buy\\" list. I won't make the mistake of buying another of their albums without knowing the whole story again. It's sad, just sad. That's all I can say.
B00005MP58|1.0|I will forever love the story of Mr. Darcy and Miss Bennett, but, sad to say, the poor quality of this film made it distracting. I have a beautiful bedside Toshiba television set. The color is superb, yet this film was so colorless. No tone, depth, downright pale. I didn't even bother watching the second disc. It was the price that lured me. If you don't mind colorless, and you just want to hear and vaguely see the story, then by all means ...

B0000AQS0F|4.0|I am a fan of Joss Wedon's work so I confess to being somewhat prejudiced towards liking this dvd set.  I also like sci-fi and westerns so merging the two not only delighted me but made this dvd set a must have for my collection.  I did not get to see Firefly on television because the network kept changing the schedule so I missed all but one episode.  I was very disappointed when the show was canceled before I had a chance to really get to know the characters and almost didn't buy the dvd set because I wasn't emotionally invested in the idea.  But because I am a fan of Wedon's work I did and I am glad I did.  I would recommend this set to anyone who has enjoyed Buffy The Vampire Slayer and/or Angel.

B000025H06|3.0|MOSTLY UNISPIRED INSTRUMENTALS.<br />THIS REALLY ISN'T A CARLOS SANTANA SOLO ALBUM.  IT IS A SANTANA BAND GROUP EFFORT (EXCEPT FOR 2 TRACKS).<br /><br />Released in 1987, this is a collection of odds and ends.  There are alternate takes, live tracks and a few tracks of Santana fooling around.  It is 44 minutes long and the sound quality is very good.<br /><br />I don't konw why this is listed as a Carlos Santana solo CD.  All but 2 tracks were performed by the \\"Santana\\" band during that time.  And the remaining 2 tracks were performed by about the half the group.<br /><br />The 1980's was not the best decade for Santana.  His studio albums had a stripped down sound that conformed to the tastes of the time.  His music was more pop oriented.  There is nothing wrong with that, except that many of the songs were not very good.  But, he continued to be very good in concert.<br /><br />The music on this album, has the same feel as the rest of Santana's 1980's output, only it is better than most.  This is partly because some of the tracks are live. Other tracks are studio reproductions of jams they did in concert.<br /><br />Much of the music reflects the sound of the eighties.  There is the sharp drum notes that were popularized by Dire Straits on Money For Nothing.  It was the beginning of digital recording and people were playing around with sonic improvements and wider dynamic ranges.  There is also the annoying synthesizer sound that populated much of the New Wave and Disco music.  I like synthesizers, but they were poorly used in the eighties.<br /><br />Two of the tracks on this CD are alternate takes of done during the recording sessions from Freedom and Zebop!  The version of Deeper, Dig Deeper here is much better than what was on Freedom.  Here it is an instrumental with some manic and funky guitar work from Santana.<br /><br />The best track on this album is Mingus, which has some interesting synthesizer work from Chester Thompson.  Unforntunately, it is less than 2 minutes long.<br /><br />There is nothing bad on this album (unlike the rest of the Santana albums from the eighties), but most of the music is bland.  On the Santana albums from the eighties, I have been pulling off the 2 to 4 good tracks and have been getting rid of the CD's.  With Blues For Salvador, I will keep the whole CD.  But, if I were ever to lose this CD, I probably would not bother to replace it.<br /><br />I don't think Santana fully recovered from Festival (1977) until 1990, with Spirits Dancing in the Dark.an 2 minutes long.<br /><br />There is nothing bad on this album (unlike the rest of the Santana albums from the eighties), but most of the music is bland.

0385340540|5.0|Not only does Grisham write a fascinating tale, but he bases the bulk of it in some of Italy's beautiful towns and describes the customs, scenery and history in detail, working it all into the story... making this book one of my personal favorites.
B000MV8AE0|5.0|This movie portrays a very unique perspective to Ludwig Van Beethoven's musical genius through the relationship we see between Beethoven and a young, aspiring female, composer, Anna Holtz, (Holtz is a fictionalized character) who becomes Beethoven's copyist for the debut of his 9th Symphony.    Copying Beethoven opens in Beethoven's life when he is already middle-aged, deaf, egocentric, already very well know in the music world for his earlier musical masterpieces, difficult to get along with and can be intimidating if not down right rude on purpose. Nonetheless, this doesn't stop Ms. Holtz from becoming Beethoven's copyist and actually giving her opinion on changing/enhancing a section of his 9th Symphony!     Ms. Holtz even helps Beethoven conduct his 9th Symphony for the first time before a live audience. This is a highly anticipated event as to whether it will be great success or be an atrocious failure as there were doubts about how this symphony would play out because no had ever heard of a choral being performed along with a symphony.    However, the performance of the highly anticipated 9th symphony was a huge success. Beethoven and Holtz continued their relationship after the performance of the 9th Symphony when Holtz shows some of her musical compositions to Beethoven in hopes of having him help her with her musical style. At 1st he rudely mocks her musical style, but then in turn helps her with musical compositions--- thus becoming her mentor.    I highly recommend watching this movie. It is very well acted and very well done plot/story wise.

B000OZ2CZW|5.0|Instead of Good Girl Gone Bad, a more fitting title for Rihanna's third album in as many years would be Mediocre Girl Turned Awesome. Okay, so it's a bit wordy, but that sums the startling discovery that this teenager who hardly looked ripe for longevity with 2005's bumping-yet-forgettable \\"Pon de Replay\\" has suddenly transformed into a powerhouse singles artist. Monster hit \\"Umbrella\\" is refusing to leave the top of the charts on both sides of the Atlantic, and though it's not the best track here, its staying power is undeniable. Better yet is current follow-up \\"Shut Up and Drive\\", one hell of a club tune if you ignore its \\"Blue Monday\\" sample as a lazy attribute. Another noteworthy tune is \\"Breakin' Dishes\\", where the Barbadian beauty swears she'll fight a man over a stomping beat and synth stabs not too dissimilar to Nelly Furtado's \\"Maneater\\". Listening to the nature of Good Girl Gone Bad's upbeat moments, it seems like Rihanna took a hint from the electro stylings of last year's incredible \\"SOS\\" and applied it to the urban-pop format she was already aiming for. The results are scorching. \\"Push Up on Me\\" works over a skittering electronic groove, and \\"Sell Me Candy\\" is just plain, breezy fun. Even if her voice is still a weak point, Rihanna proves that she is riskier and far more entertaining than her pop peers who actually can sing (i.e. Christina Aguilera, Beyonce). A fine evolution for a singer who is turning into one of the most consistent hitmakers of this decade.
1594489505|4.0|I found this book particulary helpful in understanding the people and the place where we are fighting.  Lots of intercultural conflicts and good insights into the people and conditions within the country.  Some sad instances and word usage makes you wonder what the author meant when he made the statement.  But you begin to wonder, and I believe that is important, to wonder why the nation is so against American values when they seek many of the same things within their own country. The use of the title meaning finally came into play in the last third of the book and I found that extremely helpful to understand how it fit into the book.    Great book.  I would recommend to anyone wanting background and culture problems within that country
0670038040|4.0|I was a little disappointed in this later novel of my favorite character, Rumpole, and one of my favorite authors, John Mortimer.

I imagine it must be difficult to think up new and hilarious plots after all this time.
0375759174|4.0|Northanger Abbey was one of Jane Austen's earlier works, and, reading it , you can definitely see her gift of writing in its infancy. While this work is not perfect by any means, it is a fine-tuned effort that any Austin fan will enjoy and appreciate. Basically it works as part comedy/drama of manners and part parody of Gothic literature, taking many of the elements of Ann Radcliffe's work The Mysteries of Udolfo, and slightly satirizing it. The ending's closure--where Austin ties everything together nicely--is something seen in many of her other, more popular works, where all loose ends are tied and questions are answered.     The first part of the novel focuses on Catherine Morland, her family, and her acquaintances. Catherine goes away from her family and stays with the Allen family. While there, she meets the Thorpe family, and becomes an acquaintance and friend of Isabella Thorpe. She has to fight off the advances of Isabella's brother. Later on, at a dance, she also meets Henry, a man who she will eventually fall in love with. She finally gets the opportunity to stay with the Tilney family at Northanger Abbey. Because of her love of novels, and her chance to become better acquainted with Henry and his sister, Catherine is excited to go. The second part of the novel begins with Catherine staying at Northanger Abbey.     One of the funnier aspects of the novel is the 2nd part, when Catherine goes to Northanger Abbey and immediately becomes entranced with the many Gothic elements she seems to have read about. This is when her knowledge and love of Gothic literature tales runs away with her imagination. At one point, she believes that Henry's father has murdered or imprisoned Henry's mother, or that he is keeping her stowed away and doing malicious and evil things. There is also a moment when Catherine is alone in her room late at night and sees a chest, and fears that it has something awful inside it--so naturally she goes to investigate. It seems that all her suppositions and fears are well-founded to her, but we see that she clearly has taken some things too far in her mind, and perhaps there is an anti-climax in her not finding anything noteworthy.     What makes Catherine a likeable heroine is that there are faults to her, so she is perfect by no means. For one thing, she is oblivious to many events that are seemingly obvious to others, namely the romance that begins with her brother and Isabella. She also has some trouble expressing herself in the earlier parts of the novel, but as time wears on she becomes more assertive and mature. Also, her love for novels can be seen as a weakness because she tends to over dramatize and fantasize about them--this seems to be Austen's way of lightly poking fun at reading novels, something you have to admire from a great writer. Over all though, she is a character that is fun to read about and follow around in her adventures.     While the story does have moments where it may drag a little, it still is a fun and adventurous read and is a must for Austen fans. This review is in reference to the Dover books version of the novel.
B000NDIAWO|5.0|I'm a fan of Beyonce and I liked the original version of this album from the moment I heard it. I could identify with alot of the songs and they are great to dance and work-out to. I watched the videography and decided that I would buy this cd with the added songs mainly because of the song Flaws and All. This songs speaks to me in a very personal and lovely way and that's why I love Beyonce..lol..So I gave it 5 stars, and stamp that it's a very good cd, but I'm a fan.
0374105235|5.0|Like any good piece of first-person lit, A Long Way Gone is a sometimes tough read, just knowing that Ishmael was a young boy when this was happening is sad enough. He is so resilient it's incredible. This is a worthwile, gut wrenching story. I would recommend high school and college age kids to read this absorbing account of real life. I'm sure similar tales from the same decade could be told from children in Bosnia and other war-torn countries. It makese one appreciate peace in a world blighted by wars of choice (Iraq) and civil wars tearing civilians from their villages and creating refugees by the millions (Darfur, Iraq, Lebanon).
0689865384|3.0|Well, I don't enjoy reading or watching anything with a futuristic setting, so I'm not really sure why I bought this book. The truth is I haven't finish it, I can't get myself to. There are too many things going on, and that really throws me off. The whole name calling, living away from parents, Uglieville??? Pretty Town??? OH MY GOD!!! And the hoverboard annoys the crap out of me. But not all was bad, I just can't remember the good parts =/
B000NVIXDW|4.0|I like it, I really do. I don't love it like I loved It's Time, but I like it. I know I'm being a bit redudant, but such is life. There were a few songs that in my opinion could've been produced or arranged a little better, but overall it's pretty good. I'm a great fan of Mr. Buble so he's one of the few artist that I'll buy a cd just because he's on it, and especially any cd that he puts out because it's sure to have good music on it. So once again I don't love, but I definitely like it..

0307275639|2.0|My biggest beef with Albom is that all his novels are the exact same. His structure is kind of abstract, but always in the same way. And, besides the characters, so is the content. I gave \\"Five People You Meet in Heaven\\" 3 stars out of five just because it at least felt more imaginative and creative to me.<br /><br />I really enjoy literary fiction. I want a story that doesn't tell me outright there is some lesson to be learned. It should be the same with non-fiction as well. In this story, the message is one of those direct, sappy ones: surround yourself with loved ones and know what is important, and don't get caught with money and business. WE HAVE HEARD THAT A MILLION TIMES! Just because Albom writes it doesn't make it any different. The problem is that \\"Teusdays with Morrie\\" seems like some kind of self help book. Albom needs to learn to give only the story and let the reader make of it what he or she wants. I don't want him preaching to me, \\"I traded lots of dreams for a bigger paycheck\\" (p. 33). Come on. That is why his work comes across so sappy. There are also a lot of sappy one-liners in \\"Five People...\\" too.<br /><br />Also, the content is always the same. A character (Eddie in \\"Five People...\\" and Mitch in \\"Teusdays...\\") have a lesson they need spelled out for them...and they cry...A LOT. They don't just live the story. They take on, what I call, the empty-headed-learning perspective. The characters don't bring anything to the table. They seem so naive and ignorant and without common sense that they turn me off as a reader. Plus, no character, and I mean NO CHARACTER, in good literature can just be told a lesson and then live it. For example, would A Christmas Carol really have been much of a story if the the ghosts would have just sat down and talked to Ebenezer Scrooge--who is highly comparable to Mitch in this novel--and said \\"Hey, you work too much and you don't really enjoy life\\", and then Ebenezer just did it. No, Ebenezer had to live through the consequences of his lifestyle AND THEN CHOOSE FOR HIMSELF. The best part of a great and lasting character, and the part that Albom severely misses out on, is the growing. A good character doesn't just get told and then accept. Albom's characters are spoonfead qoutes and lessons like children..and they buy it! Well, I don't. It makes me feel like I am supposed to be an inexperianced little child rather than a sophisticated reader.<br /><br />To jazz this up, give us more of Mitch's life as a reporter. Not just glimpses of and COMPLETE SUMMARY (which is a no no I learned in beginning fiction) of his life as a business man. Albom needs to take the time out to develop the friction between Mitch's life in Detroit and his life with his old professor. The true beauty about this conflict is that there is an allure to making all that money and living it up as a great sports writer as opposed to living with less money and for what only what makes one happy. That is the dynamic to develop and it is much more interesting than Albom's premis of the \\"classroom environment\\".<br /><br />If Albom has grown as an author, it is simply to write in such a sappy dramatic way that the general public eats it up. As he says in his own book: \\"Yet they gave up days and weeks of their lives, addicted to someone else's drama\\" (42). I feel that he really doesn't contribute to any form of the spohisticated and artistic literary community at all.<br /><br />Albom needs to read some Hemmingway; I mean REALLY dig in to some Hemmingway.<br /><br />***The reason I slammed this novel so hard is because I really believed that Albom wanted his audience to think and learn from the piece. I don't believe it achieved that objective effectively. It was too sappy to be taken seriously, or as a reality to learn from--which is even worse considering this a NON-FICTION book.is lifestyle AND THEN CHOOSE FOR HIMSELF.

B0001LJC2K|5.0|Every single song on this cd is amazing! They are all deep, emotionally charged, and beautiful. You can feel the emotion as you listen to them. Completely breathtaking. Muse is one of the best bands ever created. This cd only adds to that.

B000JRYNXE|5.0|Excellent CD.  Just about every song is enjoyable.  Saw her in concert after purchasing it and loved the CD even more.  Not to be a prude, but definitely prefer the edited version.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|Muse has always been my favorite band. Black holes & Revelations is just the latest addition as to why they are my favorite. The lyrics are beyond deep and they have no problem expressing exactly the emotion intended with both their soulfilled singing and emotionally charged music. The entire cd is fantastic and almost breathtaking!
038572179X|1.0|I've slogged through Tolstoy, Dostoevsky, Hardy, and a host of other lengthy, meandering classics, but I could not get through this.    Many, many people have praised the writing in this novel. It read like a high school sophomore's stab at Very Important Writing--lots of pretentious descriptions about whatever caught a character's eye, but not much else. When the Briony character immersed herself in the fountain to get the pieces of vase that were broken in there, I had to put the book down. Had Briony ever heard of bending over and reaching into the fountain? Did this job really require a total-body immersion? This plot \\"development\\" and so much else in the book strained credibility to the breaking point.     In short, Mr. McEwan seems to have confused writing copious detail with providing a substantive plot or believable characters.
0312330537|4.0|He is a doctor, a gangster , a writer, an ex-convict and a whole bunch of other things all in one. He is the highest epitome of manhood - a guy tough enough to escape a maximum security prision but soft enough to feel compassion even for his enemies. He is Shantaram - mumbai's own superman.<br /><br />Then why did I give it four stars - its the only novel that reads like a bollywood movie - full of emotion and the perennial good vs bad war - so if you like bollywood movies ... this is the book for you. But if flowery language and shallow philosophies is not in your taste, skip ahead.
B00000K3D4|4.0|This is a great movie specially for the kids. It also has a great soundtrack as well and excellent graphics.  Also a Must own for any David Bowie Works Collecter.  Also not bad for those capturing that era of time and those young at heart. thumbs up.
0975991477|5.0|I stumbled on this incredible book shortly after returning from The Mayo Clinic in a wonderful bit of synchronicity.  They said there wasn't anything that could be done but Bruce's book said that EVERYTHING could be done, and he's right!  From Bruce I discovered Rob Williams and PSYCH-K and eventually I found the best health I've had in decades.<br /><br />If you want a book to open your eyes to the newest scientific research and what it means, this is the place to start.
B000E6ESL2|5.0|This is a great movie and takes on a different view of the movie making style.  Just when you think you know what is going on, you find you don't. Loved every second of it but don't recomend it for minors.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|After watching several episodes of the show with my 4 year old son, it is clear that this series is suitable for all ages and engaging as well.  Attenborough's narration is soothing and well paced, and the photography is simply stunning.  The behind the scenes vignettes that complete each episode are facinating.  Highly recommended.
0316548189|5.0|It is not very often that I set to read non-fiction. This book, however, was originally recommended to me by a Rwanda refugee and so I made an exception. What a good decision that was.<br />Although I was familiar with Mandela's life and South Africa's struggle against the apartheid regime, this book provided me with much more profound understanding of the struggle and the historical events leading to the eventual overthrow of the racist regime. This book, however, is much more than an account of a dark time period in the history of humanity. Above all, this book is an amazing portrayal of a life of a man, an exceptional man who is much too human. We are taken through time, from Mandela's childhood to his presidency, blessed with a unique view of a man marked to die in a secluded prison. His struggle to become a \\"first-class\\" citizen and the brutal force with which the then government crushes the hopes of the young men and women is only but a part of the story. Most importantly, we are allowed a unique window into Mandela's psyche and his philosophy, for this book, to me, is mostly about human spirit, its strengths and its weaknesses. Mandela's contemplations regarding the social order, humanity, law, schools and his personal approaches are fascinating and profound. He delves into the depths of human behaviour in a fluid, understandable way; his words flow on the pages from one event onto the next, while maintaining a uniform message. Although he did engage in securing financing for a possible armed conflict, his hopes and faith reside in a non-violent solution. Mandela's life is, after all, one giant wound on the face of mankind. Neglected and abandoned by the superpowers of the world, the people of South Africa never lost hope and Mandela is a fascinating and shining example of a man, stripped of everything, who, no matter what life threw in his way, maintained his dignity and his sight not only on the problems, but also on the solutions. An amazing read I am happy to recommend. This book should be read by everyone.o recommend. This book should be read by everyone.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|After seeing the series on the TV, we knew we just had to have the complete series to see over and enjoy, but also to share with family and friends not fortunate enough to see it.  The photography is simply amazing, and the diaries at the end of each segment are very educational re: how much effort by very talented and brave photographers and crew was needed to put this all together.  Every student (K - college) should be required to see this to fully appreciate the beauty of this planet and its inhabitants.[[ASIN:B000MR9D5E Planet Earth - The Complete BBC Series]]
B0001GOH6Q|4.0|I liked this movie a lot. True to the book, but smartly changed when it served the visual medium of film. One bit in the book I was hoping Tim Burton would discuss why he didn't take was the thing that really kept people in Spector, the imaginary town. In the book, there's a fierce dog that bites people's fingers off if they try to leave. Very Burton-esque. Couldn't figure out why in the film it was about the shoes.    However, I loved the relationship between Edward and Sandra Bloom - both as young people and as older folks. The simplicity of their love and complete acceptance of the other was touching. I thought William struck exactly the right tone, trying to come to terms with his father before the latter's death. All in all, the movie was an interesting juxtaposition of 'real life' and fantasy.
B0000DIXDR|5.0|What else can I say.  I have the VHS, DVD, both soundtracks, I love this movie.  It's a simple story, girl meets boy, girl falls in love with boy, boy takes a little time to fall in love with girl, it all works out in the end.  What's not to love.
B00005JPAO|2.0|Everyone seems to truly love this movie - I was bored to tears.  Although it gave a nice overview of the events of the week of Diana's death and was very informative, I found the acting to be dreadfully boring and the direction was lacking.  James Cromwell is one of my favorite actors and even his performance was abrupt and overall did not flow well.  This movie could have been a million times better if it had a better director.
067003830X|5.0|Few times have I been as impressed with a book as I am with this one. The author upsets many old notions about how the brain operates, which is immeasurably practical for anyone who has a brain. Many of the case studies explained by Dr. Doidge, the author, deal with learning disabilities, stroke patients, and other abberant brain conditions, yet the insight provided by these special cases will illuminate anyone's knowledge of personal growth and potential from a neurological standpoint. Best yet, the text is written in an entertaining style, rather than the stiff prose of academia. Many friends have already thanked me for recommending the book to them.<br /><br />Patrick Plaskett
1594489505|5.0|I loved this book.  Mr. Hosseini has the unique gift of making the reader feel \\"in\\" the story.  I feel as if I know more about Afganistan after reading this book.  I would have liked Mariam to have been avenged in the end but that isn't reality. SHe was marked from her first day.
1400064287|5.0|As a business owner, I am bombarded with techniques on how to get my marketing message across.  This book, Making it Stick, is my favorite.  It is a funny and effective approach to creating a message that gets remembered.<br /><br />The authors (two brothers!) break it into easy to rememeber peices:  SUCCES(s) - Simple (Core Message), Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional and Stories.  They give great examples all along the way and of course they use their own model so it really is memorable.
B000LC4ZF8|5.0|This is hands down Tom Hank's best movie to date... followed close by Forrest Gump.
B00006I53S|5.0|I recently purchased the EF 28-135mm f/3.5-5.6 IS USM while on vacation in New York in June. (I hit all the \\"big boys\\" and came away from B & H with more than a few bargains).    I found the use of the lens to be more than adequate on my daily \\"shoots\\" during my walks thru the city. Since I take some time to frame my shots  (I used full manual), I was pleasantly surprised when 99% of my photos came back totally \\"in focus\\"  Even when I purposely \\"shook\\" the camera.  The lens was incredibly responsive, even when I shut off the IS during a night Yankee/Mets game. Color return was vibrant.     I do recommend purchasing the following Canon items (don't cheap out with this lens):  a good UV-HAZE Filter (L-39 Sharp Cut),  Circular Polaring filter (PL-C)and the Canon Lens Hood (EW-78BII).
B00005OAE6|5.0|If you like Bob Seger, you'll LOVE this one. It brings me right back to the late seventies and I crank it up.  Not even one bad track. Enjoy!
B0002B55WA|4.0|This is similar to all the other Beatles movies. The camera work is not great although there are some terrific special effects. The trac of \\"I am the walrus\\" is particularly fun to watch. The DVD does not have subtitles or captioning. Altogether, the movie is a an interesting psychedelic trip with the Fab Four, and a bus full of passengers, through the English Country Side.
6305897786|3.0|A deep, yet entertaining movie that will leave you baffled and bewildered at first; however, don't give up on this film.  Good solid acting, incredible directing, and a story with so many questions it leaves you wondering what it is you just watched!    I have always liked Polanski films, as well as Johnny Depp's acting, so this movie (for me) was a must see.  I'll admit, the first time I viewed it I was left confused and I said to myself that I regretted purchasing it.  Giving it another shot recently, I was able to really sit and watch the movie for what it really is, an intellectual masterpiece.    It may leave you with many questions, but again I urge you not to give up on this movie.  It has a message that really blurs the lines of good and evil and shows that there may be both good and evil inside us all.  How it ends is really up to your interpretation.

The best asset of the book is that it can be utilized so well across the curriculum. It is trememdous for education classes.
B000E5N684|4.0|After years and years of hearing about this movie, I recently purchased it at a local Wal*Mart.  Let me say this, do not underestimate this movie!      Although it may not be as shocking or cutting-edge as it was back in the day; this movie still provides a lot of substance from the original intention.  The acting is superb.  There is honest chemistry between Douglas and Stone; each play off of each other's strengths making it come off as genuine and not forced at all.  The supporting characters also add essential realism and help develop the story even further.  Within the characters, each has their own distinct personality and the viewer gets to know them pretty well by the end of the story.  The characters are dramactic when called for, but also provide subtle comic relief when needed as well.    The directing however, is what makes this movie so well good.  Everything from the script (kept relatively in its original form) all the way to the lighting and the way that affects how the viewer reacts to certain scenes.  As for the nude/sex scenes; I believe they were done in a way that enhances the story and/or develops the characters further; not done just for the sake of doing them.    As I mentioned don't let this movie fool you.  It is very well crafted and provides some good suspense and entertainment.  After years of avoiding it, I'm glad I finally own it!
B000066C1N|5.0|I really like this CD. It has some fun songs as well as a few orchestrated songs. Alot of the tunes sound very similiar, but all and all, its worth it.
B00012BD0S|5.0|Thanks to s friend at my college for constantly bugging me to check out Symphony X, I have become a pretty big fan.  I was able to get my hands on a copy of what many call their masterpiece \\"The Divine Wings Of Tragedy!\\"  I'll be honest, this album in my opinion is one of the most epic pieces of art I have ever heard; and for me, ranks right behind \\"The Odyssey\\" as my favorite Symphony X album.    1. Of Sins And Shadows -  This is just an amazing way to begin an album.  Harmonizing vocals of heavy and rough, mixed with a higher tone make for a very melodic feel.  The backing choir vocals also give it a very Bohemian feel (very Queen like).  Awesome guitar work, tying the whole song together.  Amazing! 5/5    2. Sea Of Lies -  Keeping right with that feel, this track kicks in and pulls no punches.  Again just awesome seemless instrumental work by the band fully harmonizing with the vocals. 5/5    3. Out Of The Ashes -  I love this song.  To me it seems to have a very deep meaning, but has an upbeat rocking way of making that message prominent.  The backing vocals really add the element of having an \\"epic\\" feel to it, and again the guitar work is top notch.  So far the band keeps the perfect score going! 5/5    4. The Accolade -  This is the song that sold me on the album.  After hearing part two on \\"The Odyssey\\" I knew I had to hear what they called part one.  I was not disappointed in the least.  Starting off slow and melodic, the song picks up steadily throughout.  Awesome vocals and powerful lyrics, mixed with amazing instrumental work, make this song alone a classic! 5/5    5. Pharaoh -  This is the first song on the album that took me more than one listen to really get into.  A heavy tune to pick up where \\"The Accolade\\" leaves off. Heavy riffs and deep vocals make this song very prominent.  May take a couple listens to like, but is a very cool song. 4.5/5    6. The Eyes Of Medusa -  This track keeps right on pace with \\"Pharaoh.\\"  Heavy riffs mixed with very soft, yet very vibrant instrumentals.  A lot of what the band does well is seen in this track.  Like the previous track, it may take awhile to get into, but this song rocks.  Very heavy and very dark! 5/5    7. The Witching Hour -  This song is another very melodic output by the band.  However, to me it seems just a bit rushed and cramped with a lot of material.  Not a bad song at all, but a bit off kilter with the rest of the album. 4/5    8. The Divine Wings Of Tragedy -  Ah, the epic of the album.  A song in which the rest of the album was merely prepping you for.  This song is a journey all its own!  I love the beginning of the song esspecially, it is very different from any music you hear today.  Very melodic and somewhat soothing!  Than, enter the heavy power of Symphony X!  Overall, a seven-part epic that will make you stand at attention and truly appreciate hat a masterpiece this album really is! 5/5    9. Candlelight Fantasia -  I would call this a bonus track after the masterpiece beforehand.  Again, the band shows no signs of slowing down in terms of having a lsting impact in their music!  Love the melody and overall tone this song has, adding to an already steller album! 4.5/5    Overall, this album is a MUST HAVE for any and all fans of both Symphony X and/or Progressive Metal!  In my opinion this album is one of those rare masterpieces that come along once every 10-12 years!  Just pure brilliance!
B000FP2OPY|4.0|This series is an excellent noir fantasy show. It is well plotted and funny in all the right spots.  The actors hit their strides about half way through the season and it really takes off.  It is a refreshing change from the sugar coated Angel and Buffy (both also good tho). It is very much like watching a 22 hour horror movie.
0618680004|1.0|I read the book (most of it) hoping to find some new insights about atheism. After all, Dawkins is being touted, honored, crowned with glory for his \\"ideas\\". I want my money back. These are the same arguments I heard 40 years ago in the school yard. There is nothing new in the book (though he writes well, I must say). If I were an atheist, after reading this book, I would immediately join a church and get baptized.
B000A59PMO|5.0|I have only recently gotten into Veronica Mars.  I happened to catch most of the third (and last) season and have now rented and seen the first two.  I was disappointed to hear that it has been cancelled.  It's a very unique, witty, and highly addictive series.  The first season introduces us to sassy Veronica who has recently been unceremoniously dumped by her high-class boyfriend Duncan; her best friend, Lilly, has been murdered; her father was ousted as sheriff; and she was sexually assaulted.  Geez!!That's a LOT for anyone to deal with.      She's going into her junior year of high school pretty much alone, an outcast from the rest of her classmates.  That is until Wallace shows up, a new kid to Neptune- he isn't aware of her \\"sordid\\" past and comes to like Veronica for who she really is.  The chemistry between Veronica and Wallace is fun to watch- they really come off as great friends, and show a lot of spark and mischief in just a twinkle of the eye.  The same is true with Veronica and her father, Keith, now a private investigator.  They have a very unique father-daughter relationship.  I'm kinda jealous... They have great rapport- their conversations are always fun, playfully combative and witty banter, the dad is funny/silly/goofball but ultimately cares for and protects Veronica.    The season is a fun, roller coaster ride of mystery, intrigue, romance, friendship, and \\"normal\\" high school drama.  My one complaint is how something is mentioned or happens and then is not resolved (or even brought up again) until a few episodes later.  The season ends on a very suspenseful, stressful, and hugely climactic note.  I couldn't wait to get my hands on season two.  A wonderfully entertaining show that unfortunately was cut short way too soon.    It's amazing how much can happen from four little words- \\"I need your help\\" and how many times Veronica hears them.  But also how many times Wallace (who works in the school office) hears \\"I need a favor.\\" lol...  Don't miss out!  It's a highly addictive show; so have all seasons ready to go.
B00005JPHT|5.0|Michael Moore's left-wing credentials have been clearly established by his previous films, but his latest documentary, SICKO, just might create some common, non-partisan ground.  After all, who among us, conservative or liberal, would deny that the health care system in America is sick and in need of help?<br /><br />Although Moore does briefly address issues facing the uninsured (be prepared for a man stitching up his own wound in one of the opening scenes), he focuses his film on the problems facing average insured Americans like you and me.  Personally, I believe that I generally have received very good health care services, but I've also never faced any type of major illness.  If you weren't already afraid about the potentially catastrophic impact of a serious health problem, Moore will definitely scare you.  One of the case examples I found to be the most compelling was that of a middle-class couple with good jobs (she was a respected newspaper editor) and a nice home where they had raised their children.  But after he suffered several heart attacks and she battled breast cancer, the high costs of their health insurance deductibles left them impoverished, forcing them to sell their home and move into their daughter's basement.  And this horror story is just one of countless cases that occur in the US daily, tragedies that could happen to any one of us at any time.<br /><br />Moore's solution is one that every other Western nation has already discovered:  universal health care (AKA socialized medicine).  Virtually the entire second half of the movie consists of Moore's visits to Canada, Great Britain, France, and Cuba; in each new locale, he provides plenty of persuasive evidence to convince his viewers of the numerous advantages that accompany government-provided health care.  Although Moore's methods are sometimes a bit over-the-top (e.g., he sails to Cuba with a group of Americans needing health care, including the woman mentioned above and several 9/11 rescue workers), it is difficult to argue with his main point--namely, that every man, woman, and child living in these countries receives high quality health care completely free of charge.  As Moore notes, it's certainly worth giving up your \\"Freedom Fries\\" for that!<br /><br />Moore himself seemed to have less screen time here than in his past films.  As always, however, it is his disarming, in-your-face style that makes his movies so riveting; he has a real knack for presenting information in a way that makes you believe in his message.  And believe in it I do--it is simply a travesty that the richest, most powerful, and arguably the best nation in the world does not meet the health care needs of ALL of its citizens.  Hopefully, Moore's latest film is a step towards increased awareness, and even better, a step towards change.e workers), it is difficult to argue with his main point--namely, that every man, woman, and child living in these countries receives high quality health care completely free of charge.

B000FL7CAK|5.0|Though I didn't enjoy the second season quite as much as the first, it is still great entertainment.  This season the mystery surrounds a school bus crash.  There are many suspects and red herrings but the ultimate perpetrator is a BIG surprise.  The chemistry between Veronica and Wallace is still great fun to watch- they really come off as great friends, and show a lot of spark and mischief in just a twinkle of the eye.  The same is true with Veronica and her father.  They have a very unique father-daughter relationship.  I'm kinda jealous... They have great rapport- their conversations are always fun, playfully combative and witty banter, the dad is funny/silly/goofball but ultimately cares for and protects Veronica.    The season is a fun medley of mystery, intrigue, romance, friendship, and \\"normal\\" high school drama.  Veronica graduates from high school and you're left to wonder just what is to come of the feisty detective next... The season finale isn't quite as stressful and suspenseful as the first but it's still a heart-pounding roller coaster ride of emotions.  I can't wait to see what happens next!!
0812550706|5.0|I first read Ender's Game when I was 12 and it opened my eyes again to reading, a hobby I haven't given up to this day. Orson Scott Card shows us a stark future inside this book, putting us in the setting of a world with population controls, extensive testing for our children, and a world temporarily united to fight an off world menace, called the Buggers. They have attacked Earth twice before and we only barely survived the last attack. The book's main character, Ender, is one of the best fictional characters I have ever read.    The book does more than most science fiction books, this one has a stronger sense of morality. It explores both the future, and dilemmas of conscious.   I have loved this book since the first time I read it, and reread it at least once a year. I recommend this for anyone who loves a good read and is tired of simple science fiction, Orson Scott Card and his Ender series books are truly diamonds in the American writing rough.
0800141849|5.0|I read a review on this site where the reviewer - obviously a man - said that the entire film is dedicated to the characters telling Barbra Streisand she's beautiful.  Spoken like someone who has never felt - or been told - they are ugly, only to realize later in life that they're beautiful after all, even if just to one person.  That's the premise: what is beauty, after all?  Does inner beauty trump the external?  (Goodness, we hope so!)  How much does physical appearance matter?  What is the nature of attraction?  How can sex mess up a perfectly great relationship?  The dialogue isn't a barrage of people telling Barbra she's beautiful at all.  She looks in the mirror, trying to think of herself as beautiful, and fails.  This is something that echoes the literary classic Jane Eyre (the book) that I relate strongly to.  How many of us have looked in the mirror and seen only the flaws?  I love this film.  It makes me think about these issues.  In a world where Paris Hilton makes headlines on less than zero merit, the questions this film asks are as relevant as they were when the film was made.  And let's face it, we ALL want to dance in the street with Jeff Bridges!  NOTE:  Finding this film in widescreen format is a Herculean feat.  In fact, amazon accidentally sent me the wrong disc to begin with, and I had to exchange it.  (The guy who said that the film was all about Barbra Streisand's ego was also wrong about the DVD containing both formats: it does not.)  If you're cool with pan-n-scan, the full screen might do for you, but if you're like me and want your movies in their true original format, make sure you are getting the widescreen.
0553383663|4.0|Reading this book helped me to realize just how fascinating Google is; it is unlike anything produced in the information era.  I use Google everyday and can't even imagine what life was like before it. I enjoyed reading of the insights into the founders and of the rise of Google from a simple idea of creating a better search engine to titan of the technology industry it has become. In the few short years since Google started we all now have a super library, phone book, calculator, reference guide, dictionary and much more all available with the stroke of a few keys.  I have come to greatly admire how Google has become so amazingly proficient at what it does and so profitable, I greatly anticipate their next advances.

0307346609|4.0|The common nerd enjoys yarns about alien invasions and zombie uprisings. The truly dedicated nerd, however, likes to pore over the details of the public policy response to such events. I have far more tolerance for Independence Day than anyone sensible person ought, largely because I find thinking about the aftermath of the attack an enjoyable intellectual exercise. With most urban areas and industry destroyed yet the population largely unharmed, the technical problems associated with food distribution, health care, and disaster assistance would have been staggering. Moreover, the destruction of most of the world's infrastructure, combined with the abundance of battered alien technology lying about, creates a fascinating set of political problems. Frankly, I doubt that Bill Pullman's administration would have the policy chops to handle these problems, but that's really a question best left unpondered.<br /><br />World War Z is Max Brooks' follow up to the successful Zombie Survival Guide which detailed the strategies and tactics that individuals should use to identify and escape zombie uprisings. Max is the son of Mel Brooks and Anne Bancroft, and has a remarkable comedic ear for questions of public policy. World War Z: An Oral History of the Zombie War, is a Studs Terkel style retelling of the major events of a large zombie outbreak. The details of the outbreak are interesting but not particularly important; rather, what gives the book its strength is the plausibility (an odd word for a zombie novel) with which the tale unspins.<br /><br />A zombie uprising represents a series of public policy problems that touch on virtually every role that the modern state plays. It is a health care crisis, a contagion control problem, a threat to social order and property, a threat to local police and legal institutions, and finally a problem of military capacity. Brooks traces the zombie uprising through all of these facets of state power, starting with the first outbreaks and the ineffective state responses. Institutions governing international trade and transit fail to contain the contagion. Social disruption in urban areas exacerbates the problem and overwhelms local authorities. Panic ensues, and public confidence in governmental institutions collapses. Military forces attempt to restore order, but lack the doctrinal and technical tools to solve the problem. Utter collapse and extermination threaten. Brooks describes most of these stages in realistic detail. I was especially impressed by his discussion of a military effort to destroy a zombie horde in Yonkers, New York. Anti-personnel weapons that rely on the destruction of part of the enemy's body fail to seriously damage zombies. Tactics that concentrate on fire support, cover, and concealment are of no use whatsoever against a foe uninterested in its own survival. I spoke about this chapter with a seargeant in the Kentucky National Guard who had also read the book, and he said that he found the setup remarkably compelling; he had no doubts that officers would indeed order the men to dig in and construct useless field fortifications over the objections of the non-commissioned officers.<br /><br />But, as we know from the movies, a zombie outbreak is an essentially soluble problem. Zombies are slow, dumb, and can be killed (Brooks holds to the traditional slow, mindless zombie, rather than the quick zombies of the new Dawn of the Dead or the learning zombies of George Romero). Local governmental authorities develop ways to detect infection and means for cordoning off and clearing certain safe areas. Brooks gives the most credit (both technical and political) to the Israelis, a decision that I found kind of interesting. He then gives an entirely reasonable account of how the major military organizations rethink their operations and restructure their tactics and procurement decisions based on the new threat. The zombies are eventually defeated, although they cannot be exterminated andthe cost is extremely high.<br /><br />Although I doubt I would ever be able to pull it off, I would love to do a policy simulation of a zombie uprising at my school. Brings new meaning to \\"thinking outside the box.\\" In any case, be sure to read the book even if you don't have a zombie obsession. Brooks takes a very few missteps, but the narrative is solid throughout.igh.

B000089RVX|5.0|Fans of bands like Nightwish, The Gathering, Lennon Murphy and Lacuna Coil are either rejoicing or cursing Evanescence.  Their brand of atmospheric gothic rock / metal is quite comparable to all bands mentioned above yet they are the ones in the Billboard Top 10 Album chart.<br /><br />\\"Bring Me To Life\\" is a stunning track on its own merit that could stand to lose the male pseudo rap-rock vocal yelling \\"Wake Me Up\\".  (If you hear the demo version without the male vocal you will understand)  I find it amusing that fans of bands like Linkin Park and Limp Bizkit are buying this disc just on the basis of this track alone only to realize that the rest of the disc is moody, dark journey into the belly of various beasts. Nevertheless, Amy Lee has a haunting voice that layers beautifully over gothic rock/metal passages much like Tarja, Anneke, Christina, and Tori Amos.  \\"Haunted\\" is a short, but remarkable track that allows Amy's vocals to breathe chilling words of despair.  Just read the cold words to \\"Imaginary\\" and you wonder what exact demon tortures the writer's (Ben Moody) soul.<br /><br />Overall, this disc is way too deep and thought provoking for its target audience.  For those of us that have supported this style of music for years, please don't pass judgment against this disc until you have experienced the overall enchantment within its 11 tracks.

1596912855|5.0|All this time I thought I was alone.  I thought my secret heart patterings for Mr. Darcy were mine alone.  Oh, and the smoldering moment in the BBC's Pride and Prejudice when Mr. Darcy gazes at Lizzie over the pianoforte?  Remember that one?  Shannon Hale does!  She knew exactly how I felt when I saw the way he gazes at her, face it - don't we all wish someone would look at us that way?  God - yes!    Shannon Hale has written some very well received young adult books - I loved the Princess Academy, but I love Austenland more!  It is my book - it is your book too if that above mentioned scene stopped your heart and made you long for that moment to happen in your life.      Jane is given a surprise vacation to Pembrook Park - a place where Jane Austen's England is played out for paying tourist to experience.  A living history manor and though she has reservations (ha!) Jane goes to try to cure herself of her Darcy longings.  Through her life Jane has measured every romantic and non romantic encounters with Mr. Darcy's image.  Naturally, no one ever measured up to such lofty expectations.  During her stay Jane must sort out what is real, what is not real and what she really wants.  Beginning each chapter we are given brief history flashes of Jane's love interests and what she learned from each.      This book is going on my keeper shelf destined to be reread again and again!
B000Q6GXW2|5.0|Don't listen to the negative responses from the Bluray fanboys, the HD DVD combo disks are a great deal. For those having both HD DVD and standard DVD players, you can watch the movie in all your players! You fanboys need to get a life!    To you Bluray fanboys: Stop spreading your garbage about a dying or dead format..

The Bluray fanboys would have you believe that Bluray is superior in every way... that is just NOT TRUE! HD DVD is a fully supported and finished format PLUS with the HD DVD version, you will have many interactive features such as choosing your own endings and web connectivity. The Bluray version is, well, just the movie.     This is not an HD DVD fanboy rant, it is telling the truth.

An exceptional piece of documentary filmaking, Planet Earth is beautifully filmed - much of it just breathtaking -  and never feels like the \\"educational experience\\" it is. Often funny, and sometimes quite touching, it presents every facet of our living planet. This is absolutely essential viewing.
1592402690|4.0|I am a producer in the SouthWest and I am always looking for fresh and innovative ways to record artists and musicians.  Though this book has many interesting tidbits about the dynamics between the members it lacks in the recording process.  There is no groundbreaking information here, but, I must add that it was groundbreaking then.  I am still glued to the book, though, and recommend it if only to get a feel of the mentality of the members during these important years in the history of rock music.
B00005R24K|4.0|i bought the vhs version from a friend because i thought it was a zombie movie. it has somewhat of zombies but the main thing in this movie is an  evil spirit is awaken when 5 teans want to spend a few days in a forest in  a cabin but  they find a book that is supposed to awaken the spirit  and the spirit is in the trees. this spirit can also turn the people into   these possesed zombie things that are controlled by the spirit. after a  good hour of the movie only one person is left (if i told you it would be  a spoiler)and that person is trying to kill the zombie things and try and stop the tree spirit. but anyway the movie is surprisingly good and is worth a watch once or twice and the ending couldve been a little better  but that is why there is a sequal i guess. also one more thing is that i wasnt really scared but there are a lot of scenes where something would jump out of nowhere but i like a good scare.

Rhys Meyers is outstanding as the young King Henry VIII, as are Maria Doyle Kennedy as Katherine of Aragon, Sam Eliot as Cardinal Wolsey, Jeremy Northam as Sir Thomas More - the list goes on and on.  The production values are impeccable - costumes, sets, all are first class.  It's fascinating to see Henry from this viewpoint, as a young man.  He was indeed the \\"rock star\\" of his age.
B000AWYOGE|2.0|I found this film to be more depressing than scary. The bulk of it seems focused on the soul numbing daily problems faced by a recently divorced young mother. I wish to forget the \\"rat-race\\" part of life when I am in that darkened dream arena, not be plunged eyeball deep in another's. For the most part, whatever few scares there are can easily be explained by natural causes, provided by the film's storyline. The music and overloud/overdramatic sound effects try desperately to drum up the suspense...but grow tiresome when there are no payoffs in the story. It's got a group of good actors that need a story with an arc that includes tension and release, ups and downs of human emotions, scenes that instill dread and suspense...drama. Not unrelenting depressing existence.

0143038095|5.0|You know, it is funny, I have read Amy Tan's The Bonesetter's Daughter and The Hundred Secret Senses, adoring them both beyond words--why it took me this long to get to her first work is nothing short of inexcusable. Not unlike Louise Erdrich's first novel, Love Medicine, this debut of Tan's is absolutely spectacular (it boggles my mind that first time authors can produce such seemingly flawless, multi-voiced narratives). Given the fact that Amy Tan was so young when she wrote this book blows my mind simply because the wisdom and expertise inherent in her storytelling go far beyond her years. In fact, I think this is my new favorite Tan novel, and not only do I believe she is the best Chinese American novelist out there, but at the top of the list of all authors, period. True storytellers are few and far between. Tan straddles the line between academic literature and pleasure reading, which, unfortunately, is not often accomplished.<br />I have been a devoted student of literature for over six straight years now (specializing in American minority literatures), and the other day, I was talking with a fellow colleague and classmate about this book. When she told me, in her \\"yawny\\" way, that she felt it was boring, I realized for the first time, that regardless of \\"smarts,\\" there are actually literature students out there without one iota of literary taste. What a shame.<br />This book is truly phenomenal and speaks volumes about what it means to be a woman, for better or worse. I cannot recommend this book, or this author enough.
B000OCXF0Q|5.0|This is a different approach for Avril compared to her first two albums. It sounds like she has been listening to some Toni Basil, because there is a good bit of cheerleader like musicical influences in the sound she is putting out now. Combine that with the more raw punk attitude of the skate parks and a large amount of teen angst, and you get this album.    Originally I purchaed the censored version of this album, but realized I could not stand the censoring that was going on. The blanks in the singing just threw me off. Within two weeks of listening to the censored version, I ordered the uncensored one, and haven't gone back since.
B00005JLKN|4.0|Reading all the novels, this one back in 1986, I recall being so scared, having to leave my father's apartment, walking to the nearest coffee shop to finish the story. This killer thought about his prey, nothing spontaneous, everything planned to the minute's detail. Harris's tale brought me out of a world of insulated `safety\\", to the knowledge of evil.<br /><br />A few years later, came across \\"Silence of the Lambs\\" to read the tale in one sitting. The serial killer in this case, a mutant cross dresser gone mad, making dresses from his victims skin. \\"Buffalo Bill\\" imprisoned his victims in a deep hole, feeding them just enough to ensure their skin, once at the correct weight, would be added to his \\"dress\\" and the body thrown away. Mr. Bill is not sophisticated in his motivations, in fact absolutely mad...but throughout the film...and novel, is Hannibal's relationship with Starling. There is a connection: something more, something absolutely diabolical.<br /><br />\\"Hannibal\\" the novel, hits the world and the story is good but overrated by the critics because it is making so much money.<br /><br />Dr. Lecter has disappeared from the scene. After travelling to Venice, he attempts to settle himself amongst the beauty of his imagination.<br /><br />But this is another film.<br /><br />Red Dragon is well constructed and well planned.<br /><br />Director Brett Ratner rose to the occasion and gave us a great instalment.<br /><br />The first time seeing Red Dragon thought it was too plain, didn't like it, the second time, once putting the film in perspective, noticed it followed the novel and now, enjoy the film for its continuity, and presence overall.<br /><br />Well done.

0751532711|5.0|No exaggeration - this is the kind of book that can change someone's life, and apparently it's already changed tens of thousands of lives.It all begins with the right outlook, the right perspective on financial things. This is stuff they just dont teach in schools, but I wish they did. If these principles were taught to every American teenager, America's financial mindset would be so much different, as far as personal finance, wealth-building, and retirement are concerned.     One of the most valuable things we can give to our kids is knowledge of financial things. I'm grateful to Robert Kiyosaki for writing this book. It can not only change the thinking (and the financial future) of those who read it, but it gives the reader valuable knowledge and insight that they can pass on to the next generation.     Personal finance was something I was never taught while growing up. Looking back, I wish I had been taught it, instead of having to learn some of these things the hard way. Many of us have decided that it's going to be different with us; that we'll make sure we give our kids a solid foundation of financial knowledge that we never really got. This book helps give that solid foundation, the benefits of which can last a lifetime and beyond.     I feel that Robert Kiyosaki has done a public service by writing this book.
B000068OCS|5.0|Shot in the late 70's and early 80's, this film has aged quite a bit from its introduction.  This, as it turns out, only adds to the works splendor.  I first saw this work in a live performance at Symphony Hall, Boston in 1990.  Then, which seems like yesterday, it was less then 10 years old.  Never-the-less, it made a deep impression on me and the audience as it received a tumultuous standing ovation at its end.  In the 17 years that have passed since I first saw it, it has only grown in its meaning and complexities.      For me, the films ultimate meaning resides in the depiction of God's creations and man's futile attempts at that same act.  Looking back at the nearly 30 years since it was first shot, the scenes of the Grand Canyon, clouds, deserts, Niagara Falls, etc., look as wondrous as ever, while the clothing, cars, haircuts, etc., seem hopelessly dated and tacky.  Is there something to be said of nature being perfect and timeless and man's efforts being inherently flawed?      As for the music, this remains to me Glass' masterpiece.  It is his best composition and his finest overall artistic achievement.

Once again, not a bad song on this album and really a companion to 'The Grand Illusion'.  You have to have both.  The only song that I thought never really fit and I owned it on vinyl when it first came out was 'Lord of the Rings'.  I don't know why.  It was the last song on side A of the album and always seemed out of place.  Just my opinion, but I always wondered what the heck it was doing on this album and not on a tribute to Tolkien's 'Lord of the Rings' instead.  Maybe, that's what the band was doing, I'm not sure.  Radio staples like 'Blue Collar Man' and 'Renegade' keep the band going and keep the pressure building to churn out hits.  The sappy ballads are yet to come from DeYoung;  they're just not here yet.  A must have for any Styx fan, old or new.
B000MV8ABS|5.0|Phantasm is a classic! I loved this film.  I wish they could add the footage from Phantasm 4 with all those deleted/left out scenes and put it back in the first!! That would be awesome!
B00005JA2B|5.0|Kansas had to prove it big with this release.  After 4 very medicore albums with really no radio hits (other then 'It Takes a Woman's Love' from 'Masque), the band needed a big hit very desperately.  The band delivered.  The hit, 'Carry On Wayward Son' propelled them into super stardom.  To this day this song is a radio staple that when a block is played you're sure to hear it (which can sometimes be irritating because you have to wonder if the radio station even knows the band has made a lot of other music.  Every song on this album is classic and still maintains the sound that Kansas had developed over their past four outings.  Maybe, they're striving here to make a commercial sound, but for this album they succeeded in combining the best of both worlds.  If you're not familiar with Kansas other then the hits \\"Carry on Wayward Son' and 'Dust in the Wind' from 'Point of Know Return' start with this album and you won't be disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|I watched several episodes of this series. I wanted to give it a chance, seeing as I've been a SF fan for over 40 years. I've seen bad and good TV series, great and really, really bad.  Firefly falls in the later. Let's see.  It's the future.  Does humanity speek a primary language or group of languages? A mixture of any two languages? Nope.  A hodge-podge of alien dialects? Nada.  In his \\"wisdom\\" the series creator (I can't be bothered to remember his name) went with - Bonanza-eze.  Yep, pardner, That thar's one of dem dare space shap thingies.  Gee Wilickers! For some reason he imagines that since man is now on the space frontier, they genetically revery to old western Amercaneze.<br /><br />Ship design? Lame. They look cartoonish and designed by a 9 year old. SFX? Poor, no budget, pre 1970's.  Acting? These are graduates from the Keanu Reeve's acting school. With honors.  Gnarly! Wooaaaaa. Darn toootin'!<br /><br />Fans of this series are so over the top it's crazy. Move out of your grandma's basements guys - this series stank worse than four day old dead fish.
0385340559|5.0|I am constantly wondering when Child will fall off his game - but I have to wait longer as this one is one of the best of the Jack Reacher novels - and I re-read them all prior to reading the latest.<br /><br />Reacher is in rare form on this outing as we learn a big chunk of his back story. Each book truly just get better and better - and after \\"The Hard Way\\" I didn't think he could do it again. I was way wrong!!
B000000W5L|5.0|You know, I haven't visited this album in a long time; it has been one of my very favorite works of art since its release in '72, but it seemed like one of those things that might have been played out for me.  I've been helping my wife load her iPod with things I think are essential, and naturally this came to mind, so in the process I gave it another spin. To say that I am reinfatuated is an understatement, which gives rise to this review.  \\"Exile\\" is just such a work of uncommon depth and maturity and desperation and joy and carnality and the whole nine yards that it is nearly staggering.  Plus it rocks harder than you ever will.  Don't listen to haters who bemoan its lack of hits; it flows like nothing else...best digested as a whole.  And anyways, \\"Tumbling Dice\\" was a certifiable hit back in the day; I know, I was alive then, and it was an indelible part of the soundtrack of the summer of '72.  This listen brought me back to my very first needle drop on \\"Rocks Off\\" in '72 when I was 13 years old.  From the first whomp of Charlie's drums I remember it as being a life-changing experience that gave me some idea of what adult music and life was all about.  And the power and glory of this record is such that I have always been mystified over the critical response alluding to the allegedly murky mix, etc.  To me it simply sounds like the perfect example of what rock and roll is supposed to sound like, and when words and phrases emerge from the mix they're almost always a surprise, even after thirty-five years.  This record is proof positive of the enduring greatness of the Stones, and is to my ears their finest hour, and then some.    Quick question:  My CD version of this is an original CBS era iteration (bought it like in '87-88), and it still sounds pretty good to me, even with the undoubted advances in mastering since then.  Is this relatively newer Virgin version a BIG BIG BIG sonic upgrade, or just a sonic uptick?  Thanks!
B000MNP2KI|5.0|The James Bond spy film franchise is reborn with this movie.  Lets you forget all those awful Bond films with   Roger Moore.  Not just a first rate acting performance by the new Bond but a much better and more credible story line.  Truly a worthy successor to the Shawn Connery classic Bond movies.  Definitely worth the money.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I fell in love with this movie from almost the first moment and continued to enjoy every minute to the end. I found it to be wonderful, heartfelt and genuine, with superb acting from every member of the cast. This movie is for viewers who appreciate quirky, understated, charming and very funny.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|An amazing nature series with images that have to be seen to be believed.  Awesome!  This from someone who doesn't generally like nature shows.  This one is different and in a class by itself.
B000002GZ1|5.0|I echo anybody that says this is one of the great albums ever.  Butter and Bloomer are transcendent.  This album and any good Muddy Waters anthology belong at the top of any blues collection.  Can't say enough about it.  But there is one important point.  Online there is a petition to get Paul into the R&R Hall of Fame.  It has a lot of good groups in it, but also some one hit wonders and other mediocre selections.  Here is a guy who was hugely influencial at his time, who's impact is hard to measure, who was so important to the evolution of the music we listen to, who's artistry is incomparable and indisputable.  He belongs in the Hall.  Find the petition online please.  Give a little back to Paul.
B000N6TX1I|3.0|Interesting film but wildly overrated by the critics.  Confusing and ambiguous story line trips up a pretty good cast and produces a mediocre science fiction film.  I am afraid that all this film really foreshadows is more bad movies to come.  This film does not, by any stretch of the imagination, compare to Sci-Fi classics like Blade Runner.  Save your money and watch it on cable.
B000C20VPA|5.0|We received our purchase in a timely manner and it was is good shape.  This was a pleasant experience.
B000BW7QWW|3.0|This is a pretty good story with pretty good acting.  Not great by any means and not as good as an average episode of Battlestar Galactica or Star Trek Deep Space Nine.  Shows you how far down the Sci Fi movie franchise has fallen that some people think of this as a classic.  Not a waste of money but it wouldn't hurt to wait to see it on cable either.
B000NQR7KM|4.0|Why i do not give 5 stars ?<br />- I wish I could enjoy a completed cinema show video.. WITHOUT CHARLIE CHAPLIN movie..<br />- I wish I could enjoy a completed super's ready videw..

B00005JMYI|5.0|My husband and I both LOVE this movie!  It is laugh out loud funny from beginning to end.  Everyone I have recommended it to says the same.  You can't beat Will Farrell!
B000J103N4|5.0|This is one of the finest albums of the late sixties early seventies. The remastering is beautiful, the DVD sound amazing. When the engineer had Crosby in the studio about the time that the Dead's American Beauty was being recorded, he ran the recording tapes a double speed. You can hear with a clarity unparalleled for the time.    The band includes so many of the best (look up PERRO, the Planet Earth Rock and Roll Orchestra). The songs are meditations. \\"What Are their Names\\" is one of the most powerful antiwar songs ever written. The vocals and instrumentals are flawless, mellow, strong. Crosby is to be revered, for this gem alone.     You will not regret.
1591841666|5.0|Listen, I have ghostwritten for some of the top online marketers and have also been at the helm of many corporate endeavors for years. I think some people may assume thi sis common knowledge, but it isn't followed!    Seth shines light on a simple way to recognize when you need to quit, push past, and rev up your momentum for bigger and better things. If you're an online marketer, I especially recommend this book because more than any other industry, we're caught up in \\"multiple streams of income\\" and every hyped up buzz factor that gets driven into our paths on a regular basis.      I'd consider this mandatory reading, to be honest with you.

0740748475|5.0|I waited eagerly for this to arrive.  I had originally tried to order this last year, but the shipping costs to Nigeria was huge, so i backed out practically weeping.    I came back to it a month ago, ordered it and it got to me in 2 weeks!  Sitting down with some small chops beside me, I reverently opened the first of the books, and ........... Words betray me.  It is .......beautiful.  Calvin reminds me of me and at the same time, frightens me about my kids.    For those that have not tried it, allow me to introduce this volume to you.  I'm sure you will not regret it.  For those that have, get this. It guarantees a lifetime (almost) of fun.    As for me, my evenings and weekends are booked.  Cheers Bill. For creating an epic. Calvin & Hobbes are a delight to me and my friends in faraway Lagos.
B000OYC3J8|5.0|To be brief, this album is simply brilliant.  Jack White, once again, restores my hope for the future of the music industry.  Give this record a listen; you will hope as well.
B000ASATWQ|5.0|I really like this album, because Damian throws in a lot of different styles and techniques, which can uncommon with some reggae artists.  I believe that these different styles are an advantage, because it keeps the songs varied and diverse.
B00000JXVK|4.0|This is a good bike documentary that spans several different categories such as off road, flat track, some road, and endurance.  Its nicely done, and features Steve McQueen, an avid motorcyclist and auto racer himself.<br /><br />Its somewhat dated as it was made in the 70's but I like that era so it made it a little more special for me.
B000AL730O|3.0|I first listened to this album when it came out in 2005.  It took me til 2007 to really understand and appreciate this album.  I had to listen to it a number of times before I started to like the songs.  I had to understand that this Macca is not of Beatle fame already.  One can't really detach him from the Beatles because they were such a famous group in the 60's.      Paul still writes with the poppy feel that he often used when he was still with the Beatles.  The melodicism and the melancholy in past Beatle albums are still there.      Here are a few points that I have noticed:    Jenny Wren--- very Blackbird style  A Certain Softness---- still remember 'And I love her'?  English Tea--- flashes of Eleonor Rigby  This Never Happened Before--- basslines akin to basslines from Rubber Soul album and upward albums  Riding to Vanity Fair--- can pass for a track in Abbey Road    For me, to really appreciate Paul now is to not really look back with his past Beatlse work.  We should understand that his inspirations change through time but his talent for writing songs is still there.  I still like him now and I am thankful that he still writes today because there's way too much groups that churn out songs that can be passed for noise these days.
B00003CXRM|5.0|This is a classy release of an all-time-favorite classic. George Clooney played Batman, and here he's doing a hillbilly chicken dance in a fake beard. Great writing, great acting, great music. What's not to love? We wore out our VHS copy!
B000PKG6TE|5.0|I will admit I am somewhat biased. I am a MASSIVE Queens of the Stone Age fan. However I don't let this get in my way of subjectivity. I didn't find their last album Lullabies to be as flawless as they normally are. However this is different, their music is the hardest they've ever played. Much more heavy rock influences than in the past. Josh Homme has made a masterpiece here, whenever a song gets monotonous or when you would love a quick change in tune, it's there. I have never seen such good timing in any album ever. It is as if Josh predicted any shortfalls and shut them down accordingly. Don't get me wrong this doesn't beat Songs For the Deaf (which is an absolute must own, really no questions asked). However it is their most in depth, in tune, and insane album to date. And falls just short of SftD, and falls into their number two slot for their greatest albums. They aren't a legend in the music industry but if you ask any big time musician such as Dave Grohl (Nirvana, Foo Fighters), Trent Reznor (Nine Inch Nails), Julian Casablancas (the Strokes), Billy Gibbons (ZZ Top) and even P.J. Harvey, they will all tell you they should be.
B0009UC810|5.0|This 25th Anniversary Edition is a great way to say \\"Happy Birthday\\" to one of the all-time great movies. Well worth the wait!
B000MG1YC0|5.0|Of much more consistent quality than their earlier albums, Nine Destinies and a Downfall is a solid example of innovative contemporary gothic metal. A great album overall. Highly recommend it!

A Gothic style of romantic mystery really well written.<br /><br />When a world famous best seller author decides to tell \\"the truth\\" on her life, the world of Margaret will change forever. Ghosts, misterious children and haunted masons will thrill you and seduce you in a timeless tale.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the book and the style of Diane Setterfield. This book is the ideal for your rainy evenings and a good gift for friends that love books.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|The original \\"party animal\\" teen movie (despite its \\"R\\" rating), Landis's outrageous feature-length prank has enough gross-out humor, slapstick yucks, and all-night beer chugging to put a drunken smile on anyone's face. Matheson and co-stars James Widdoes, Peter Riegert, and Bruce McGill bring sheer lunacy to their roles as leaders of a riotous frat house for rejects, losers, and academic failures. But it's Belushi's gonzo portrayal of Bluto that remains iconic, and helped make the former \\"SNL\\" cast member a bigtime comic star. Irreverent, subversive, and totally inappropriate, \\"Animal House\\" depicts the college experience most of us never had, but kind of wish we did. Watch for Kevin Bacon in a small early role as a young pledge.
B000002UAU|5.0|Good to hear this again after so many years. So many familiar songs on one album.
B00009Y3L4|5.0|Fosse's groundbreaking \\"Cabaret,\\" a Broadway musical-turned-showstopping film event, was itself based on a novel by Christopher Isherwood. While the film considers Germany's dark, historic slide from Weimar decadence into fascism from an intriguing angle, it's the effusive, stylishly choreographed song-sequences that elevate the film to classic status. Minnelli was never better as the brash, electrifying Sally, especially belting out \\"Money\\" or the Dietrich-like \\"Tomorrow Belongs to Me.\\" And who can forget Joel Grey, the Kit Kat's eccentric, ghastly master of ceremonies? Winner of eight Oscars, \\"Cabaret\\" is a flamboyant knockout.
B000002LBH|5.0|Looking at the list of songs on this album, I am overwhelmed at their brilliance. I don't know how they did it, but Morrissey and Marr had some connection that allowed them to create some of the most magnificent songs ever written. The Smiths are comparable to U2 in talent and song-writing ability, they just were never quite as popular because they never sold out to the mainstream. Although Morrissey can be a bit pompous at times, he has always stayed true to his art. I dont need to tell you that this album is worth buying because every review gives it 5 stars.
0783225725|5.0|Eastwood's eerie, magnificent \\"Drifter,\\" his second effort in the director's chair, turns the final showdown clich&eacute; of the Hollywood Western on its head: Instead of confronting the killer posse alone, for money or out of brute contempt, The Stranger teaches the cowardly townsfolk how to defend themselves--then promptly disappears. And where else but in an Eastwood flick would the protagonist, for the purposes of intimidation, have a town literally painted red and renamed Hell? Such flashes of dark humor animate the story, as do The Stranger's haunting flashbacks, the austere sets, and the cast of irregulars. Enigmatic and violent, \\"Drifter\\" reworks the Man With No Name persona into a mystical folk hero, and the effect is riveting.

B000FSME1A|5.0|Though both the original and \\"Redux\\" are worthy, they suffer from director Coppola's narrative excesses, the longer \\"Redux\\" even more so. Still, the new version includes new scenes which clarify some loose ends in the original. Either way, it's an epic, mesmerizing acid-trip of a war movie that melds together the savage themes of Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness\\" with the inherent waste of Vietnam. Grand spectacle, augmented by brilliant use of music. Acting is superb, from Sheen, Duvall and Hopper in particular. Even bald, bloated, incoherent Brando fascinates. Once seen, never forgotten.
0800141660|5.0|Yes, yes, if you are an Austen fan Mr. Darcy is dashing and bold to be sure, but the quiet gentleness and honorable love of Edward Ferrars for Elinor Dashwood is a delight to partake in, in this adaptation of Jane Austen's \\"Sense and Sensibility.\\"  This film was quite faithful to the book, and the actors and actresses were suberbly chosen, as were the costumes, setting, and dialogue.  It's such a lovely story with very good lessons to take to heart, as Emma Thompson (Elinor Dashwood) learns to hope that what is lost, is not lost forever, and Kate Winslet (Marianne Dashwood) learns how sensibility can prevent a broken heart.  So, if you are craving the delightful romance, agony, humour, and hope of love in Jane Austen's England, this film will not disappoint.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|Still under age 30 when released, wunderkind director Spielberg hit the big time with this runaway box-office hit, based on Peter Benchley's novel. John Williams's unforgettable score and Spielberg's clever mounting of suspense recall the best of Hitchcock, and Scheider, Dreyfuss and Shaw make up an unlikely but appealing trio of protagonists. What \\"Psycho\\" did for the shower, \\"Jaws\\" does for the ocean. Be sure to get the new 30th Anniversary edition- the movie looks flawless.

B0001US8FI|5.0|\\"Dragon\\" breathes fire for purely one reason: the riveting presence of Lee, whose personal charisma and particularly ferocious brand of martial arts made him an international star. Part James Bond-style thriller, part Hong Kong chop-socky extravaganza, \\"Dragon\\" was Lee's last film, and quite justifiably his most popular. His battle with the gargantuan fighter Bolo (Sze) is a head-turning highlight, as is the scrappy brawl between real-life karate champions John Saxon and Jim Kelly, playing shady ex-pat Americans. But the film's climax, a harrowing confrontation between Lee and the deadly, claw-fisted Han in a hall of mirrors, turns this kung-fu classic into an extravagant Asian treat.
6304981635|5.0|Probably the best known of Bruce Lee's films, this one has a great cast of supporting actors who were skilled martial artists in their own style.Lot's of great action and a great display of Bruce's unsurpassed skill.

B0009HLD0K|5.0|Peter Yates's heartfelt, life-affirming movie will prove a winner for older kids and adults. Christopher is appealingly quirky in the central role and the film showcases the budding talents of future stars Quaid and Stern as two of Dave's buddies.

B000G8NXYQ|5.0|This stunning Criterion edition features a newly restored high-definition transfer, along with a grab-bag of first rate extras, including \\"Fellini's Homecoming\\", a new documentary exploring the director's complex feelings about his origins. \\"Amarcord\\" itself remains unabashedly lewd but also deeply sentimental.Fellini's surreal film memoir won the Best Foreign Film Oscar, and it's easy to see why. With its circus-like feel and an engaging cast of cranks, fools, fanatics, and horny teens, \\"Amarcord\\" is a splendid homage to the director's hometown and misspent youth in pre-WWII Italy. But there's also a dark undercurrent, as we sense the Fascist menace slowly impinging on the lives of Titta's relatives. Set to Nino Rota's winsome score, \\"Amarcord\\" is a marvelous melange of indelible anecdotes by one of the world's great directors.

B000QUUD60|5.0|Peter Watkins's fascinating biopic about a troubled, nontraditional figure is itself iconoclastic, as it approaches telling Munch's life story through a mosaic of re-enactments, personal diary readings, and faux documentary footage, often repeated for effect. Distant from his father, Munch finds sustenance in a short-lived affair with Mrs. Heiberg (Fraas), a married woman from whom he draws inspiration. Using a variety of sound and color elements to convey Munch's state of mind, Watkins's engrossing film mirrors the inner turmoil of its talented subject.
B000002UA0|1.0|First, let me say I love this album. Its beautiful, lovely, piquant, quirky, ripping, gripping, insane, rock n roll. Yeah! redgrevillea's review got it right when he mentioned this is art and the rest of the Pink Floyd albums are architecture in comparison. Its one of the few records from this time that has stood, and will continue to stand the test of time. It lives and lives up to it's reputation.     Fans of the later big budget corporate albums will be confused by this record. Seek corporate rock elsewhere you niny brains, there is plenty of that stuff out there. Tons of it. You are obviously in the wrong place.    Unfortunately, REALLY UNFORTUNATELY, this is a textbook example of how to screw a reissue up. Its hard to understand their decisions.    FIRST off leave off the best cut on the original album \\"See Emily Play\\" which is a psychedelic classic and maybe THE psychedelic classic of the era!!! DUH! ??? Its the first song on the original and sets the tone for what follows. SECOND change the order of the cuts putting the long instrumental cut that is more like later corporate Pink Floyd RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE... for no apparent reason??? I like Interstellar Overdrive. But it is probably the song that most original Pink Floyd fans will skip EVERY TIME and it shouldn't be right in the middle. Sid got it right the first time when he put it last. It works much better that way. The idiot who decided to reorder the songs is just that, an idiot. You ding dong, you know who you are.    The inclusion of out takes \\"Bike\\" and \\"Flaming\\" which are not on the original is a good thing. I wish they had included more out takes. There is certainly room for more of the songs from that era. Oh well I guess I'll just have to DOWNLOAD them if I want to hear them. Dumb. The original order should have been preserved and as many of the outtakes as they could fit should have been included at the END after Interstellar Overdrive, to differentiate them from the originals. If they had done that this would be a 6 star CD. The music is great despite the production.    One last thing. Syd's problems, contrary to popular UNINFORMED opinion, were NOT due to drugs. If they were, EVERYONE in Pink Floyd, most of their original fans, and a good percentage of this generation would have succumbed too. Think about it, 90% of the people who built the personal computer industry dropped acid and listened to music like this. Syd had organic mental disease. Every review that mentions that Syd was taken out by drugs should be suspect, because it doesn't take much insight to understand that's just TOTAL NONSENSE.     One star for this reason - so people who are searching might be able to find this, one of the few reviews that makes sense. However its still a great album. I'd want to own a vinyl original before I'd want this but if you don't have a turntable, then buy this and DOWNLOAD \\"See Emily Play.\\" Maybe just download it all.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Romero's ghastly sequel to his legendary \\"Night of the Living Dead\\" is equally brilliant and perhaps even more unsettling than the first installment. It is also spine-chillingly funny, making blunt comparisons between the dead-eyed, gore-loving zombies and vapid American consumers. (Next time you're at a mall, the impression will be hard to shake.) But for all its satirical wit, \\"Dead\\" also features riveting action sequences, culminating in the final showdown involving soldiers, bikers, and endless waves of the undead. Tom Savani's ghoulish effects are not for the faint of heart, so be sure you're in the mood for explicit slaughter.
0440238609|4.0|Phillip Pullman fires a provocative shot across the bows of the religious right with his fantasy story of Lyra's quest. She wanders between parallel worlds, each different to 'our' earth in sometimes subtle ways, but all permeated by a pervasive dark matter \\"Dust\\". In some worlds, the church labels this Original Sin, in others an Inquisition does its divine work; all the while secularists and atheists recognise it as little more than a manifestation of collective human intent. The flow of this matter between worlds is a destabilising influence that must be stemmed, hence Lyra inevitably finds herself embroiled in a thinly veiled Revelations scenario that pays homage to CS Lewis' Last Battle. Witches, talking warrior bears, angels and a hero braver than Frodo Baggins (and more fallible) lead us through this rollicking tale that will be hidden from children in places where theories like Intelligent Design are not dismissed as nonsense. Had he similarly creative genius, this is the kind of story Richard Dawkins would have written for his grandchildren.
B000022TSH|5.0|Cynical, brooding, and knotted with mystery, Polanski's \\"Chinatown\\" is not just one of the best films ever made about the City of Angels, earning a dozen Oscar nominations--it's also one of the most superbly crafted, post-`40s noirs you'll ever see. The cast, of course, can't be beat: Dunaway is at once jittery, seductive and impenetrable, while Jack is at the top of his game as the Chandleresque former cop Jake. Real-life legendary director John Huston also delivers a titanic performance as the arrogant Cross. Watch for Polanski himself as a knife-wielding thug with a grudge against nosy people.
B000PY52EU|5.0|From the writer/director of \\"Hustle & Flow\\" comes \\"Black Snake Moan,\\" the best film I've seen in 2007. It's a unique film that features two terrific performances by Samuel L. Jackson and Christina Ricci, both delivering their best performances in years. It also features another star-making performance by Justin Timberlake (who recently impressed me in \\"Alpha Dog\\"). The film stars Ricci as Rae, that girl that lives in every city in America and is usually referred to as \\"the town slut.\\" After her boyfriend Ronnie (Timberlake) leaves her for a stint in the Army, she begins getting more and more destructive; eventually, she is almost raped, beaten, and tossed out in the road. Lazarus (Jackson) has recently been left by his wife for his brother and when he finds the young girl lying in the road he takes responsibility for curing the \\"sickness\\" she has.  So, naturally, he chains her to his radiator. When she finally wakes up, she's shocked at first but eventually grows to love Lazarus...And soon, they realize that Lazarus is not just helping her but they're helping each other. This is a great film and, as a result, it's been hailed around the world as such...But it hasn't quite garnered commercial attention and this is sad. It may not sound like the kind of movie that will appeal to a massive audience, but it's a movie that I think people will find themselves enjoying. It's a fable about love, redemption, and sex...The story could've gone in many different directions, but writer/director Craig Brewer keeps it all together and takes what could've been a completely meaningless story and makes it almost life-affirming. Jackson is an actor who never fails to impress, but he's an actor who has made more bad movies than good ones. Here, I'm not going out on a limb by saying it could be his best performance (and maybe even his best film) since \\"Pulp Fiction.\\" Ricci has always been an actress that's impressed me, but she hasn't done much worth noting over the past 5 years. That makes her comeback here all the more impressive. She combines all the right notes of vulnerability and sexual animosity to make this performance incredibly believable. As for Timberlake, he didn't impress me as much here as he did in \\"Alpha Dog\\" but he definitely leaves me asking where he got his acting chops? If he chokes a pretzel and ruins his vocal cords or something, acting could definitely be a fall back for him. Brewer is quickly joining the ranks of great writer/directors and his 2nd film is even stronger than his first.    GRADE: A
B00005K3NR|5.0|Based on Stephen King's book, this horror outing finds director de Palma at his twisted best. Spacek is perfect as the diminutive blonde bombshell set to detonate, Laurie causes involuntary shudders playing Carrie's deranged Mom, and you can't wait to see all those nasty adolescents at school get what's coming to them.( This group includes future stars John Travolta, Nancy Allen and Amy Irving). The concluding prom scene is one of the great sequences in all horror films. An inspired choice for Halloween.
B000OYC3J8|2.0|When I first heard them I liked the White Stripes because of their Led Zeppelin sound but after a few listens it's apparent the Stripes are not up to par with Zep. Maybe they are aware of their limitiations and that is why they maintain that playful aura or maybe that is the realm they prefer to play in. In their early years, when Heart would channel Led Zepplin they really rocked. I don't see that here. But I do give the Stripes credit for not doing a straight rip-off like Lenny Kravitz does.
6305546789|5.0|John Carpenter's first and best entry in a long series, this movie gives the slasher pic a good name (that is, until you sit through all those pale re-treads). This lean feature works because it's both original and daringly basic: Laurie is a young teenage girl up against a monster, with only her wits and her two feet to protect her from the wrong end of a large butcher knife. Will Laurie and her young charges make it to Thanksgiving? You'll remain on the edge of your seat finding out.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This is one of the best WWII depictions I have ever seen. So many stars in many great roles.
0688172377|5.0|I might have seen Waris Dirie in many magazines over the years, advertising make-up or clothes, a stunning supermodel.  Flicking through those pages, without a second thought, really shows how many times we can be fooled by appearances.  There's a story beyond any of us and who would have thought that that lovely, proud African lady had such an incredible, painful one to recount.    This is a difficult book to read, not because of its prose, but for its contents, especially the ones related to the female genital circumcision.  What Waris had to endure and her accomplishments in life later on, after her escape from native Somalia, are something quite amazing.  She is currently an Ambassador for the UN, focusing on the fight against FGC in Africa and in the Western World.    This is a book that will often make you stare into space, trying to come to terms with the reality that Waris describes.  It is not, however, written in hatred or spite.  The love for her native country and for her family is there, so strong, despite everything.  This book is an eye-opener and an educational one, as well as an autobiography.
B00003CXB4|5.0|This classic story is filled with important life lessons presented with appropriate viewer language.  My kids have been introduced to how all life is connected on this planet.  It is a great resource for kids to associate how life works between species.  The family story is also important.  All of this packaged with great songs and enchanting performances from the actors.
0743454537|4.0|I don't know what any of us would have done under the circumstances which surround this particular, unfortunate family of five.  One cannot but sympathise with them all, trying to stay afloat, each in their own individual way, despite a terrible illness constantly tarnishing any daily normality and threatening one of their daughter's life.    I think this book is extremely well written.  I particularly liked the way each character is given his/her own space and voice, often describing the same event/circumstance under a different point of view.  I found the character of Sarah, the mother, the least likeable but perhaps the most challenging-for ensuing conversations-.  Her attempts not to lose her sick child, often obliterating everything else, is very well described.    The courtroom drama, the twists and turns surrounding the main event, connected with the loving younger sister/donor, i.e. the core of this book, are also well described and often very moving.  This is certainly a book that poses questions most of us don't often think about, moral choices so harrowing that there simply isn't an easy or correct or incorrect answer.  In the end, one is left wondering about the unpredictability of life.....
B000BW7QWW|5.0|It's unfortunate that the series was as short lived as it was. This movie wether familiar with the series or not was a spectacular end to what could have been an even better story. I hope they inted to do a seqeul in the coming years!
0753820250|5.0|I think this was an excellent read.  There's a lot to get acquainted with in the beginning and the events are so strange, it takes a while to put things into perspective, but everything makes sense in the end.  I also appreciated the sense of drama sometimes alleviated by a humorous situation/dialogue, giving the reader a small \\"break\\" from such an intricate sequence of dramatic situations.<br /><br />The Spanish feel of this book was not at all spoiled by its translation, which in my opinion is excellent too.
1582701709|1.0|Positive thinking isn't going to get you a new car or pay your mortgage. This book and the film assumes that the law of attraction governs all aspects of your life. The philosophies pointed to in this book can be helpfull but to believe you can get something for nothing (which this book promises) can be a huge set back. You want a new car or to pay your mortgage? Work hard.
0316067598|5.0|This is a must read.   It gives you a new appreciation for what our men and women in uniform are up against every day in the war against terror.  I hope all the arm chair liberals read it.  We are fighting people who hate us with all their being and don't have any rules of engagement.  As Marcus points out, it's costing American lives.    The story is very well written.   I have not read in a while and I could not set this book down.  It begins with Marcus talking to the families of those who died that day.  That hooked me immediately.   It then takes you through Marcus' experience at Seal training at Coronado.   Initially I thought the authors spent too much time on this part as I was familiar with BUDS training.   However, it gave me a new perspective on the actual training and really made me appreciate how the training prepares SEALs for their jobs - there can be no quit in them.   The actual operation Redwing details don't start until about page 160 and they are gripping.   The actions of Danny, Axe, Matt and Marcus are incredible and border on the unreal.  They are true warriors.      Marcus says he died on that mountain. I would say this book changed me forever, and I myself am a veteran.   The end left me in tears - sadened by the outcome and eternally grateful to those who serve.   A special thanks to all those in SPECWAR who live to put their lives on the line for us every day.  And thank you Marcus for sharing this story.   God bless you.
B000EOTAM6|3.0|This film fell short in many categories. It was a simplified, stupified, redheaded step child of the original series. It lacked finesse and the sexuality you would expect from a film emulating the AEON FLUX series. Charlize Theron is hot though.........
0374105235|5.0|The amazing, heartbreaking and triumphant story of this extraordinary boy is a MUST, MUST read.  Couldn't put the book down even though my heart was aching.  It changed me and let me know that no matter in what way or how small, I have to contribute to helping children in need.
1582701709|5.0|This book was a marvelous review of information I already was familiar with but was not applying as well as I could!  I also got the DVD and have shared viewing it.  I read the \\"Secret Summaries\\" before going to sleep.
0385522401|4.0|\\"They were young, educated, and both virgins on this, their wedding night, and they lived in a time when a conversation about sexual difficulties was plainly impossible.\\"  This is the opening sentence of Ian McEwan's short, heartbreaking novel, On Chesil Beach.  The virginal protagonists are Edward and Florence.  McEwan is at great pains to show that these are two \\"normal\\" people.  Edward is not a closeted homosexual - he's actually something of a he-man.  Florence is not unenlightened.  It is not even religion that has caused this state of affairs (they both seem to be atheists).  It may be hard for people in the twenty-first century to believe, but there was a time - and not so very long ago - when it was the norm for people to be virgins on their wedding night.  McEwan is also at pains to point out that, if they had been born but a few years later, they might not have had these problems.    I knew from the advance press that this book was about \\"the worst honeymoon ever.\\"  Even that seems to be an understatement, once you read the book.  In true McEwan fashion though, it is impossible to predict exactly where the story will lead.  McEwan seems to be focusing on increasingly smaller intervals of time in his novels - Saturday was about one day and this novel is (more or less) about one evening.  There is very little \\"plot\\" per se, but that isn't the point.  On Chesil Beach is a character study - the reader spends very little time in the \\"present.\\"  Instead, we get to know these people and why they are the way they are.  One of the main selling points of the novel is, of course, McEwan's prose - even though this isn't a plot-driven novel, I was riveted from the beginning.
0375713751|1.0|I was expecting a totally different book, to be quite honest.  I wasn't expecting a mother who \\"juggled\\" work and housework and all with help and plenty of money.  She has a nanny and a housecleaner!  Granted, her housecleaner for some reason can't clean hardly anything beyond what's directly in front of her, but she can still afford help nonetheless.  And the ending?  I thought it defeated the entire purpose of the book.    Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone.  Thank goodness I borrowed it and didn't waste my money on it.
B00005JPCF|1.0|I'll try not to say much, because I don't want to waste much time on this terrible film.  First, let me say that this is the worst movie I've ever seen from start to finish.  Usually if a movie is this bad I simply get up and walk out.  I saw this at the theater with my 4 year old son, and he even asked if we could leave halfway through the film (and he loves movies)...  for some stupid reason, I insisted we stay (probably the $15 bucks I'd spent)    The problem?  Weak character development and a terrible story line.  The characters are simply forgettable and the story is regretable.  The environmental agenda while commendable, comes across as pathetic (this is a kid's movie, right???)   I've read in other reviews that the animation is good, even amazing - but that's not really true.  It's average if you compare it to today's standards.  If this movie had been released ten years ago, yes - the animation would have been amazing - but at this point it's completely average.    So - the only reason I am wasting more time on this film is to beg those of you who have not seen it - please take my advise and skip it!  It's not worth the time it'd take you to watch it - really, it's that bad!!!  (if I had the option, I'd give it no stars)
B000003N89|5.0|Its so good to hear a musician who doesnt force the music but rather lets it flow, lets it just drift out from within.  Beautiful, soft and mellow; this is definatly chill out music.  Hard day at work, in need of something to take your mind off the rat race?  Just slip this CD into the player and sit back and listen to a wonderful gifted jazz musician.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|I've always loved horror movies growing up.  When I first saw the previews for this show I knew it would be something i'd like - a mini horror movie each week.  What I didn't count on was being drawn into the relationship of the 2 main characters to such a startling degree.  While the premise drew me in - its the chemistry and history of the brothers that keeps me coming back each week.  Jared and Jensen compliment each other very well as brothers Sam and Dean.  Not only are they nice to look at - they boys can actually act.  Sam is the younger and more sensitive of the two - often wearing his heart on his sleeve.  Dean is the older, more stoic, protective brother.  Jensen Ackles as Dean is able to convey so much emotion in the smallest of facial expressions. It's amazing to watch.<br /><br />In this first season, not only do you get a monster of the week storyline, you get to watch the learn more about the boys as they search for their father and about the strange life that they grew up in.  Of course the show has it's own mythology as well and explores it subtley at first - tied in with all that is supernatural that they encounter.  Towards the seasons end it gets more prevalent and we also get to meet Jeffrey Dean Morgan as Daddy Winchester.  The actor is a wonderful choice for that role - he's got an awesome voice and presence.  The season finale for this show is one of the best i've seen - one hell of a cliffhanger.  I loved it.  If any of the above is of interest - you will likely enjoy Supernatural season 1 on DVD.
B00007BH3Y|5.0|I have seen the movie. Certainly liked it. Great leading roles for the three ladies but the star of the movie is the musical score. As one of the reviewers described it: the perfect marriage between a film and its soundtrack.<br /><br />The music is so transparent and clear. I remember watching the movie and being drawn into it mostly because of the beautifully crafted soundtrack. Philip Glass who I had never heard of before has managed to pull all diverse sides of the movie together. I can remember the scenes while listening to the soundtrack without watching the movie.<br /><br />Most memorable are the scenes of the three lives of the three women being shown in the begining of the movie married with \\"morning passages\\" and the scene between Niicole Kidman and the little girl with the dead bird married with \\"dead things\\".<br /><br />Such a glorious work of art composed with great insight ans honesty. I still play the CD when I need to relax and mostly when I need to be transfered and transformed from this world and its harsh reality into the magic of Philip Glass.<br />A word of thanx has to be said to the director of the movie for chosing Philip and magically marrying his music to the beatiful scenes in the movie.<br /><br />You must get this but do not indulge too much into the meanings of the movie or its messages but rather medidate in the skies of this very talented artist.
B000P2A24W|2.0|I have been a Bon Jovi fan since 1986 when I was 11 years old and heard You Give Love a Bad Name I was hooked.  Since 1986 I have bought every album they have put out <even in solo ventures>.      For the most part I have been pleased I enjoyed the direction they taken the music has progressed wonderfuly and grown up alot.  In a sense I have aged and matured with the music that Bon Jovi has put out.    Although Bon Jovi had shown country roots, until now they had never let it grow into the weed it is today.  Some songs would sound like they could be played on a country radio station but until now we were always garunteed several tracks per album that was rock in the true Bon Jovi form.    WIth Lost Highway we are given no such track.  The closest thing we are given is the track with Big n couln't cut it as rock stars Rich.    The lyrics on this album fell terribly short.  They don't even hold a candle to his previous albums Have a Nice Day, Crush ect. Jon sings the lyrics with little or no emotion     This only leaves me with one question how can a rock band that has always done well move to a genre of music that is populated today by a bunch a failed rock stars some admited some not.  Garth Brooks, Shania Twain, Dixie Chics, Big N Rich, Little Texas, Faith Hill just to name a few.    This leads me to believe that they are just cashing a check, they got the grammy and are taking there money to the bank.    Well I guess like me they have to plan for retirement.    Lets Live on a Prayer and hope the next Bon Jovi album is actualy rock. It seems These Days he is doing county.  Me personaly I am going to Keep the Faith that his next album will Bounce back and not be as weak as this.    On a good note if you get the Target exclusive track 13 is pretty good not a good rock song but a good Bon Jovi song.    HAVE A NICE DAY
B000268QB2|5.0|The first time I heard \\"somewhere only we know\\", I was blown away as never before. Actually, the last time that happened, I think I was a little kid and \\"Careless whisper\\" by George Michael came out!<br /><br />Anyhow, back to Keane and hopes and fears. Such a solid album with out of this world melodies, lyrics and production and a beautiful voice of Tom the lead singer.<br />Every song on the album is very special and the album is the longest staying CD on my CD player I think I listened to it endlessly and religiously for nearly 8 months. No wonder it won the most prestegious and most coveted award in England \\"Best album, BRIT awards\\" in 2005.<br /><br />\\"Somewhere only we know\\": Keane's best song. A painfully beautiful song with touching lyrics and melodies. It still brings tears to my eyes.  They will always be remembered for this and I think it will haunt them to the end of their career as the song they wrote and couldn't out do!! One of my favorite songs of all time.....<br />  \\"And if you have a minute, why don't we go<br />  Talk about it somewhere only we know<br />  This could be the end of everything<br />  So why don't we go<br />  Somewhere only we know.......\\"<br />  Breaks my heart everytime!!<br /><br />\\"This is the last time\\": A tower of glory.

I relate very much to this song and its strong painful lyrics and soring music go straight to the core of me. It reminded me of one of my best friends who is in Seattle at the moment and I'm sure we share the same sentiments about a town we lived in for a good while!!<br /><br />\\"She has no time\\" Don't even get me started on the painful hurt voice of Tom in this. Very honest and tender!<br /><br />Won't bore you anymore but I promise you, every song on the album is worth listening to. A very mature yet accessable crafty art work.

B000QGE75C|5.0|How often do we get a new CD release by an artist issued in a special edition with a bonus disc of  FULL LENGTH club mixes of almost every song on the album from the uptempo tracks to the slow jams, remixed by some of the biggest names on the dance charts? That's exactly what you get here. Naturally, the big attraction is the full length version of the Haji & Emanuel mix of Umbrella, which was in an edited form on the CD single. But you also get mixes by Soul Seekerz, Steve Mac, Moto Blanco, and more of plenty of other future singles from the CD, as well as a remix of the past hit SOS. Remixes range from an electro house feel to disco influenced, to tribal and hardhouse, to latin influenced. Also, on the original CD you get the bonus song \\"Cry\\" (track 13 though it isn't listed here on Amazon), which is also in remixed format on the bonus disc. Track list and times for disc two are:<br /><br />CD2<br /><br />1. umbrella (haji & emanuel mix) (6:27)<br />2. shut up and drive (wideboys mix) (6:36)<br />3. breakin dishes (soul seekerz mix) (6:04)<br />4. don't stop the music (wideboys mix) (6:37)<br />5. question existing (wideboys mix) (6:12)<br />6. hate that I love you (k-klassic mix) (7:41)<br />7. push up on me (moto blanco mix) (6:37)<br />8. good girl gone bad (soul seekerz mix) (6:35)<br />9. haunted (steve mac mix) (6:25)<br />10. say it (soul seekerz mix) (5:48)<br />11. cry (steve mac mix) (7:23)<br />12.

0060763892|5.0|I have read all Mr. Rollins books (Jim Czajkowski).  The author has excellent attention to technical and historical detail.  Similar to earlier works by Michael Crichton but with a historical twist.  It is a pleasure to read an author that clearly spends time doing his research.  If you like this book I would also recommend Year Zero by Jeff Long.
0316018953|3.0|A good quick read with little charactization.  The ending, which some say is a surprise, was no surprise to me.  All along I knew the FBI was barking up the wrong tree.  But,  Michael Connelly is such a good writer that's it's always a pleasure to read him....especially on the treadmill.
B000P0IW6E|5.0|Actually, more like 4.5 stars! I will have to admit that I was a little apprehensive when I learned that the newest Scorps. release was a concept album.  However, I have been pleasantly surprised from what I have heard.  What I am glad to report is that the songs on this CD \\"stand alone!\\"   Some of my favorites include \\"Game Of Life,\\" \\"You're Lovin' Me To Death,\\" \\"321\\" and \\"Love Will Keep Us Alive.\\"  I have no problem with the ballads as Klaus' voice sounds crisp and clear.  \\"We Were Born To Fly\\" reminds me a little of \\"Wind Of Change\\" (although certainly not as good)  \\"Humanity\\" is a great way to end the album with the intro. somewhat similar to \\"Still Loving You.\\"  This is my 5th favorite Scorps. album of all time behind Love At First Sting, Lovedrive, Taken By Force and Blackout.  A little concerned also when I saw that the 80's hitmaker for Kiss and Bon Jovi (Desmond Child) co-wrote and produced the CD.  However, he did so with what I would consider \\"admirable restraint!\\"  My favorite rock CD this year!
1582701709|3.0|Interesting but no cigar! This is a excellent re-packaging of several previous books without the spiritual uplift.
B000N3SRRC|5.0|Yep, this is one of those rare, good, rock n' roll blues albums. Clutch have seamlessly combined their own unique 'rawk' sound with the sounds of old.... the blues. Damn, this album's actually made me get into the blues and look at it in a whole new light. This is a great album... different to their previous efforts, but great none the less. And you can't go wrong with an unique voice like Neil Fallon's. This is the type of album that spits in the face of those sucky emo bands that are all over the place now... This is the real deal. Nice bluesy rhythms (drums and bass), good slide guitar every now and then... and ofcourse the harmonica. All fit in very nicely. Without exaggeration, almost all the track are brilliant... been listening to the album since it came out and it stills sounds great. Stand out tracks - Black Umbrella (the bluesiest of the lot), The Devil and me, Electric worry, Power Player, When Vegans attack, Shiny Mr Cadillackness.... good stuff.
1569242739|5.0|I have made at least six different kinds of cupcakes so far from this book and they all have been wonderful and blown most people away. The agave nectar cupcake is awesome especially if you want to avoid refined sugar. The smore cupcake is definitely one of my favorites. I HIGHLY recommend this cookbook to anyone considering vegan or not.
B000P2A256|5.0|Maroon 5 went out of their way to make this album harder, less adult contemporary.  More pop-rock, less jazz-pop.  That's OK with me, because my favorite track on \\"Songs About Jane\\" is \\"Harder To Breathe\\", the hardest, loudest cut of them all.  This album shows influences ranging from Prince to 80's Police & U2 to 90's Club music to Justin Timberlake, and that's OK too.  Hard dance music is always good.  But I have to say that the central, necessary element here is Adam Levine.  Without him, there's no show.  It's like removing Sting's voice from \\"Every Breath You Take\\" and slipping in another vocal.  Good music, but, oops, where's the magnetism?  Adam is especially good in \\"Not Falling Apart\\", in which he sings in a much lower register than usual.  And \\"Kiwi\\" is very hot.  So is \\"Can't Stop\\".  As for the album as a whole, even though I liked \\"Songs About Jane\\", I think this album was a necessary evolution for the band's sound.  \\"Songs About Jane\\" was very unique, and that's why people were drawn to it, but to repeat it would have been a mistake, in my opinion.  The music on this album won't change the world, but it is very enjoyable, well-produced pop music, and it just could be the album of the year.
0823013626|5.0|This long awaited book sure lives up to (and even exceeds!) what we'd expect from Donna Kato!  The book is meticulously and concisely written and photographed, and the projects are simply _gorgeous_!  Each unique and classy technique is more intriguing than the last....every turn of the page brings added excitement about trying out her projects.  Donna's writing style and the formulation of the book are reader/clayer friendly, and the instructions so clear and easy to follow.  I'm fairly picky about polymer clay books, and this one definitely ranks at the very top of my collection.    In this book, Donna shares with readers her unbelievably unique, creative and stunningly beautiful techniques and shares her vast knowledge.  Even this avowed 'caner' is excited about trying the many surface techniques from this book (steering me away from caning isn't easy to do!). I highly recommend that clayers from beginner to advanced add this latest of Donna's books to their libraries.  I don't think I can praise it highly enough! It's a beautiful book...a 'classic'.

B000OZ2CZW|2.0|I love me some Rihanna! I truly love her style of music. This album has really not grown on me like I thought that it would. I didn't like her first album but her second album was excellent. I mean I guess you got to grow but her music had went from bad to excellent to horrible!! I mean there are a couple of great songs like Umbrella, Push Up On Me, and Good Girl Gone Bad but the rest of it sucks!     I hope she comes out with some new material ASAP!
B00003CXAA|5.0|What clown complains about picture quality on a film that was shot in the 70's??? Come on...guys and gals...these movies are amazing and all you have to say is the picture had nicks and hairs and imperfections...This is not 300 or finding Nemo, this is not a film that was shot on a digital camera...in 2007! Get with the times and enjoy this classic film.    As Michael leaves the restroom, he pulls the trigger...pumping rounds into the people responsible for his fathers failed assassination...and all you can do is gripe about picture quality and ish.    Perfectly written, amazingly shot, these films will go down in history as one of the greatest cinematic achievement of all time.     So I beg of you, and deplore you to shut up and enjoy these films in their original, grainy and imperfect formats...you might just enjoy them that way.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|Nature stuff makes me drowsy after a while, even though I appreciate nature.  However, this stuff is just beyond words.  I'm glued to my HDTV! Go get this.  It's also great as background playback for parties.
0790729644|5.0|This is a great western. With Clint and Gene at the helm on this one, nobody can deny the quality film that this movie became. I am an avid fan of Clint's and many other amazing western films and this is up there in the top ten. People who gave this film less than 5 stars do not know what a good film is...and can go on complaining about quality films because their bad taste blinds their senses and minds to the truth that is the greatness \\"Unforgiven\\". And truly you will not be forgiven for your bad taste.     The vengeance is epic...true to old spaghetti westerns...this is a very good film.

If you are a fan of Saving Private Ryan, Letters to Iwo Jima, Flags of our Fathers, Schindler's List, Tora Tora Tora, Enemy at the gates, or any other classic WWII movie (Kelly's Heroes, ahem!), and have not seen Band Of Brothers...than you need to stop what you are doing and order it right now and watch it...If you can't get it fast enough, still order it and rent it while you wait for your very own copy to come in the mail. I like Saving Private Ryan, but this smokes it out of the water. Smokes it people, smokes it....puff puff glub glub...

The book really shows the breadth of talent and subject matter Rackham mastered, as well as his superb use of composition and imagination. An excellent book for any collection, for children and adults alike.

0385522401|2.0|As an Ian McEwan virgin, I was eagerly anticipating my tryst with this book--but it turned out to be as disappointing and unsatisfying as Edward's and Florence's wedding night (well, maybe not quite).<br /><br />McEwan does not merely ignore, but actually reverses, the wise \\"show, don't tell\\" advice about fiction writing. In his expository chapters about Edward's and Florence's backgrounds and courtship, he doesn't let us see much of them interacting and conversing with each other and their families; instead of fleshing them out in these sections, he gives us their inner thoughts, a panoply of geographical place names that won't mean much to readers outside the U.K. and a list of gourmet vegetables that Edward tastes for the first time at his future in-laws' dinner table: courgettes, aubergines and mangetouts.<br /><br />Conversely, in the play-by-play account of the wedding-night bedroom activities, McEwan \\"shows\\" each frame of the encounter with exhaustive, sometimes clinical detail. In this area, less is often more, and although it requires greater effort to write about physical intimacy with subtlety and allusion, it can still evoke the same intense reaction in the reader--without getting the sheets so messy. Do we really need words like \\"perineum\\" and the focus on the lone pubic hair that has escaped from Florence's knickers? Since I've already given away my copy of \\"On Chesil Beach,\\"  I can't use exact quotes here, but suffice it to say that the description of Edward's sticky, gummy ejaculate adhering to Florence's knees and chin is over the top--almost as if the author is trying to turn off the reader as well as Florence.<br /><br />The story could have ended effectively and poignantly after the couple's hopeless, near-tragic postcoital verbal battle on the beach, perhaps with a few closing thoughts from the author on the sadness and might-have-been-ness of it all. But instead, there is an anticlimactic final chapter consisting of what sound like afterthoughts, hurriedly recounting Edward's meanderings over the next 40 years. Somewhat mystifyingly, McEwan does not mention Florence's personal life after the traumatic wedding night, although he has paid equal attention to both characters until this last chapter. He does, however, offer an oblique but important clue. In a recent review of \\"On Chesil Beach,\\" Christopher Hitchens concludes dismissively--and erroneously--that \\"Florence, a classically trained violinist, devotes the remainder of her life to a rather spinsterish role in a string quartet.\\" Not at all. In an admiring newspaper review of a triumphant performance by that string quartet at Wigmore Hall in Oxford, the fictional reviewer singles out the exceptional playing of the first violinist, who is Florence. \\"She is obviously in love,\\" writes this critic (to the best of my recollection), \\"not only with the music and with Mozart, but with life itself.\\" Surely McEwan is implying that Florence, unlike Edward, has ultimately found fulfillment and happiness.g Edward's meanderings over the next 40 years.

1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini's second novel, A Thousand Splendid Suns, is as intense as his first international bestseller, The Kite Runner, and lived up to my every expectations.  A Thousand Splendid Suns is as equally well written as The Kite Runner, with an excellent story line, characters, and with insight into Afghanistan's cultural mores and expectations.    The women in his latest novel, Mariam and Laila, are brought together within two generations of family and friendships. Their lives are intertwined during thirty years of Afghanistan history. From love story to friendships, family connections and discord to struggles to survive within the confinements of society, marriage, and life in general, this is an intense novel, with characters that leave you shaking in anger one minute, and crying in sorrow the next minute.     That Hosseini wrote this story from the perspective of a woman, is incredible, and he accomplished it so accurately and precisely.    I don't want to divulge too much story line, and this review might sound sparse and lacking substance, but it is the type of book that one must read for themselves in order to grasp the dark, and often heart-wrenching story.  The ending is fully realized, and emotionally evokes what one will do in order to gain emotional and physical freedom.    Hosseini's writing is done with sensitivity to the cultural expectations, and he writes with word paintings that continually flow throughout the book, both with beautiful images, and images that leave one horrified. To say that A Thousand Splendid Suns is a major accomplishment, would be undermining and underplaying the brilliance and beauty with which this novel is written. It is a story (like The Kite Runner) that will stay with me, one I will never forget.
B000OY8NII|5.0|I started watching the episodes after my father started buying them off of Itunes. I Love the series; it is very well done with cool gadgets, great hummor, a good cast and interesting plot lines for each episode. I can't wait for season two to come out.
B0002IQEHI|5.0|An unfortunate aspect of growing up in America is that the turnover in culture is so fast that many older classics are almost unknown to the modern generation.  This is especially so with old movies, which, outside of holiday fare like the Ten Commandments or The Sound of Music, do not make comebacks once a decade or so, unlike clothing fashions.  This is why so many young people have never seen an Alfred Hitchcock movie.  For the longest time, I was one of the ignorant masses, until my mother told me about this great movie-maker.  I picked this up at the local library and watched it, and was amazed.  This is probably one of the best movies I have ever seen.  Part thriller, part romance, part suspense and part action, this movie presaged modern Hollywood fare such as The Fugitive, National Security, and Enemy of the State for example.  There is gunfights, chase scenes, set-ups, cliffhangers (literally), and of course the famous cover shot of Cary Grant getting chased by an airplane in an open field.  And like many modern action movies, this one has the climax right at the very end, followed immediately by a cut to the closing kiss of hero and heroine.<br /><br />This DVD restoration is great.  The film and audio quality is flawless.  The special effects are also top-notch and comparable to anything seen on network TV today.  And most importantly, a great storyline.  I highly recommend this movie.

0060589469|5.0|When I was a kid, I'm sure that I read some of the Star Trek books several times -- The Making of Star Trek, the original novel Spock Must Die by James Blish, to name two.     As an adult, one of the books I come back to again and again is Robert Pirsig's Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance. This book is quite unique. It is a narrative about a father and son taking a motorcycle trip circa 1968. A real trip. You can even see pictures taken on the trip on the web, so now a reader can see the actual characters in the story. I don't know if the story was altered much to fit the design that Pirsig intended, but the trip serves as a metaphor for a rambling lecture on the nature of reality itself and our interaction with it.     It is a metaphysics book. The motorcycle trip narrative is interspersed with talk of Greek philosophy, calculus, Poincaré, Pirsig's own descent into madness and return to a brittle sanity, flashbacks to Pirsig's years as a student and a teacher, and his musings on the concept of \\"quality.\\" Loosely speaking the viewpoint is Buddhist, though Pirsig's metaphysics is really his own creation. I suppose one might say that he attacks a purely mechanistic view, that this way actually leads to madness. He demonstrates that there is at least one logical flaw in the scientific method, and shows why following that method slavishly cannot lead to solid, certain truth.    It is very heady stuff. Not having a photographic memory, it does not stay in my mind. One can reread and marvel at the revelation of one subject after another, pulling it into his lecture (or \\"Chautauqua\\" of the mind as he calls it) about reality and quality. As the voyagers ascend the Rocky Mountains, he gets more and more abstract. In the high rockies they stop for a while, look around, rest, and then they head down to the west coast and sea level, where he tries to bring the discussion into a more down to earth, everyday realm. What does this mean for living on a day to day basis?If you are a Christian, you might wonder, how does a Buddhist book apply to me? Why should I even read this? While Pirsig aims for a combination of intuition (feeling) and experimentation, the Christian must rely on the Holy Spirit for revelation, and the Scriptures for grounding. That is for his moral life. But for everyday things like... oh, fixing a motorcycle, for example, there is not a moral or immoral way to fix it. There is a right way and wrong way. There are effective ways and on the other side there is failure. Here is where Pirsig might be more practical, for everyone. And as another reviewer pointed out below, this book might be more social commentary than philosophy anyway.     Mostly though, the book is an intellectual thrill ride, a roller coaster for the brain. People ride roller coasters again and again. Or jump out of airplanes. Or climb mountains. This is a mountain climbing book -- where physical and philosophical and scientific mountains are scaled, and then you come back down, exhilarated and exhausted. And then you say, \\"We gotta do that again sometime!\\"
B000OVLBEO|3.0|Ghost Rider certainly isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it is just about the most disappointing. I have to commend the advertising team, though, because they really sold me on the movie, and I went to see it despite the horrid reviews.<br /><br />The movie ended up making $$$M in the US alone (according to Yahoo! Movies), so I'm obviously not the only person who went into the theatre expecting the movie to live up to its previews.<br /><br />The movie started of strong; gripping opening credits and score. From there on out, it went straight to average. And I mean AVERAGE. It's almost as though they made an extraordinary effort to make sure that this movie would be as un-memorable as possible. Every time there's a scene that excites you about what's to come (the arrival of the three elemental bad guys was quite sweet), there's a reciprocating let down (I won't give away what happens, but let's just say that their encounters with Ghost Rider were less than impressive).<br /><br />But there's great special effects, right? Hhhmmmm, yes and no. What was in the previews was pretty awesome, and all that stuff is in the movie, but most of the CGI looks half done, as though they ran out money half-way through post production.<br /><br />I don't think anyone was really expecting a great plot, and I certainly wasn't, so the predictability of the film isn't one of my complaints, but the dialogue did suffer from a certain amount of cliche-itis.<br /><br />So the bottom line: For what it is, it's not bad. There's no nudity and very little bad language or innuendo, so I'd say that this would be most appreciated by a younger audience looking for a neat action flick (under 16).
B000002OX5|5.0|Review after review has said it, and I agree that this is a wonderful, unique album.  It's the first \\"old\\" rock album I \\"discovered\\" free of peer influence, and (along with \\"A Quick One\\"), I couldn't get away from it.  And this album continues to intrigue and amuse me to this day.     The songs are a diverse, interesting, and fun lot, to say the least: \\"Tattoo\\" has in recent times become more relevant than ever ... \\"Our Love Was\\" is as good as power pop gets, with an absolutely stunning studio performance that steamrolls it along. Moonie was definitely at the top of his game, and his multi-tracked drums are composed, arranged, and recorded phenomenally well on tunes like \\"Rael\\" and \\"I Can See for Miles\\".  And I love those lyrics and ultra-cheesy jingles ... nobody else has ever done stuff quite like this.      As for the bonus tracks, they just go to show that in 1967 The Who was leaving better stuff in the can than most bands were putting out.  \\"Hall of the Mountain King\\" is the best rock-n-roll thrashing up of a classical piece I've ever heard, hands down.    If you enjoy classy British rock and power pop that REALLY has some power ... and the occasional moment of shimmering beauty ... The Who Sell Out will have you grinning from ear to ear.
B000003JBM|4.0|Any hardcore fan of Gang Starr should consider this essential. If not, then any fan of laid back hip hop will find this a nice find. Sure it isn't Premo but Guru definitely keeps the Gang Starr attitude kickin' on this smooth release. Just beware, this is certainly an album relegated for the bedroom or living room with a little cheeba use and not in your fly whip. It's very laid back but then again so was Gang Starr, right? If your favorite Gang Starr song is Discipline or Moment of Truth then you're good to go.
0553804677|5.0|What can be said about The Lies of Locke Lamora which has not already been said? In many ways, this is THE fantasy novel of 2006 and certainly THE debut of that year. All respects given to Naomi Novik and His Majesty's Dragon (the other major debut), but THIS is the one ring to rule them all. Yes, The Lies of Locke Lamora is just that damn good.<br /><br />Unlike many novels, fantasy in particular, we are being asked to root for a criminal. Locke Lamora is a thief in the city of Camorr. He is a young, clever, talented, and extremely audacious thief. In short, if you or I wished to be a thief, we would dream of being Locke Lamora. Most fantasy novels which feature thieves will tend to feature a wisecracking sidekick of a thief. I'm looking at you, Jimmy the Hand, entertaining as you were. Or, you, Silk. You know who you are.<br /><br />This brings an entirely fresh perspective to the storytelling. Scott Lynch bucks another fantasy convention and to great results. More often than not an epic multi-volume fantasy will begin with several hundred pages of introduction to the protagonist as a boy and before the big adventure begins. Scott Lynch does not do this with The Lies of Locke Lamora. Lynch gives us a bit of an alternating pattern. We do get the childhood forming of a thief which we would expect where Locke is being trained by a thief / priest named Chains. But, in semi-alternating sections we are given Locke as a young man running a con on one of the rich nobles of Camorr, Don Salvara. Through this con we see Locke and his group of Gentleman Bastards and how Locke has grown into an amazing thief leading something of a double life. We also get hints of something bigger going down in Camorr with mentions of a Gray King. This is important.<br /><br />The Lies of Locke Lamora is a wickedly entertaining novel, let alone a debut. This is a fast paced, action packed, clever, funny, dangerous, sad, beautiful piece of fiction and a novel which I did not want to put down. Not for sleep, not for food, not to go to work to pay the bills, not to bathe. Reluctantly I put the book down for each, but when I wasn't reading The Lies of Locke Lamora, I was thinking about The Lies of Locke Lamora. This is outstanding fantasy in the greatest sense of the term. It is the work of a wicked imagination and one thing that Scott Lynch has apparently figured out which other authors have not is how to end a novel. As great as everything was throughout the novel, Lynch has a nearly flawless ending to the novel.<br /><br />I would normally groan a bit at the thought of another seven volume fantasy series, but Lynch wrote such a strong opening that I am relieved he is writing more novels about Locke Lamora. Red Seas Under Red Skies is officially my most anticipated novel of 2007, and yes, this includes A Dance With Dragons even should George Martin finish the novel in time to publish this year, which thus far he has not. That is how excited I am about The Lies of Locke Lamora and the future work of Scott Lynch.<br /><br />Any questions?<br /><br />-Joe Sherryod, not to go to work to pay the bills, not to bathe.

B000OYC3J8|5.0|For a band that exists based on constrictions, the White Stripes increase their versatility with each album. Yes, there are blues stompers and rockers, but Icky Thump has bagpipes, mariachi trumpets, and an ethereal spoken word number by Meg.   For those looking for traditional White Stripes blues rock, you have Catch Hell Blues, I'm Slowly Turning Into You, and the stand outs Bone Broke and 300 MPH Outpour Blues.   And then there's the title track, which, while rocking, ventures into oddball territory with one of the first synthesizers ever made, with a deep Moog-ish sound, and some politically-minded but slightly inscrutable lyrics.   The bagpipe \\"suite\\" Prickly Thorn But Sweetly Worn/St. Andrew is, according to Jack White, a nod to both Stripes' Scottish heritage, the first which would have been in good company on the Cold Mountain soundtrack, the second a noisy ditty featuring Meg's spoken word, which fortunately improves with multiple listens.   The other standout tracks are Conquest, a Patty Page cover which mixes trumpets with Jack's pounding guitar riffs, Effect and Cause, the fun Loretta Lynnish closer, and Rag and Bone, a blues track that sums up the ideology behind the Stripes and this album in particular- Jack and Meg go searching for other people's junk to \\"give it a home\\" and \\"make something out of it.\\"     For her part, Meg's drumming has never sounded better.   And Jack, in this humble reviewer's opinion, is THE songwriter of our generation. Even some of the lesser tracks are better than almost anything else out these days.     With each listen I'm finding something new to love about Icky Thump, and more to love from my (obviously) favorite band.
0385486804|5.0|Who was Christopher Johnson McCandless?  After graduating with honors from Emory in 1990 he dropped out of sight.  His quest took him to Alaska.  He died in 1992.  He had been an obsessive taker of risks.  He had been drawn to an ascetic existence.  In Alaska he sought Tolstoyan renunciation.      Chris McCandless sought to explore a portion of the Stampede Trail situated several miles from Denali National Park near Healy beginning April 28, 1992.  In September 1992 he was discovered in an old school bus by hunters, two and a half weeks dead.      Earlier he had assumed the name Alexander and had traveled extensively in the West by rail, by foot, by hitch-hiking, by automobile, (his old Datsun), and by canoe.  He survived deserts and being washed out in a storm.  He ate berries and attempted to hunt.  He faced starvation and experienced elation.      One of his friends was a talented jack-of-all-trades headquartered in North Dakota who gave him employment from time to time.  He met people he knew at the Slabs, an old Navy air base.  It is the capital of an itinerant society.  Jack London's books reflected Chris's passions.  He told people to read THE CALL OF THE WILD, WHITE FANG.  While staying at the Slabs he talked about his great Alaskan Odyssey.      McCandless lacked common sense, but he wasn't mentally ill.  In temperament he resembled Everett Ruess, a seeker who disappeared somewhere in the canyon lands of Utah and Arizona in 1934 or 1935.  Chris's qualities of monomania and self-absorption had intensified during his college years.  Chris McCandless suffered from a skewed relationship with his father and agitation of the soul.  He had been green and overestimated his resilience.  To live completely off the land is very difficult.  After July 30th his physical condition declined.  The ingestion of toxic seeds hastened his demise.      The book is engrossing.
0316018953|5.0|This shortened novel is the completed serialization Connelly did for the NY Times. It is a short but entertaining look at Harry Bosch after Echo Park. New situation, new partner. And it does not fail his readers. Harry's character still acts with his own sense of honor and duty. Never taking his eyes off of the goal - first and foremost a murder - a scientist who was coerced to steal radioactive substances to save his wife's life, is murdered after he comes through with his part of the deal. With a quantity of radioactive materials not accounted for, the FBI and National Security are called in. Piecing together the actions and the facts are what Harry does best, and he doesn't fail us.   From start to end, the book covers about 12 hours real time - and that was fascinating to see Harry in action under time constraints.   While this book may not have had the time for the usual complexities, Overlook comes through for us - until we get the next full length adventure.
1860498833|4.0|Clever, but not to be reviewed in too much detail, it will simply spoil the plot. Loved the main characters, miss them already now i've finished reading. Waters writes a proper story, with a proper plot, which seems complicated for a while, but at the end is surprisingly simple. Attempting to predict outcomes throughout the novel, i found myself quite stumped on several occasions; my entire bi-weekly swim was dominated one morning with vainly figuring a way of solving the outcome of one particular section of the novel...the things we do! It is in many ways Dickensian, but again, i don't want to say too much there, for fear of spoiling things. Suspense, romance, thievery, deceit and more,in a most persuasive narrative.

I'm not just giving this a 5 because they are my favorate band. Another thing I would like to add, The Clash aren't just punk, they hit every single genre out there including reggae and jazz. If your a jazz fan, you will LOVE this album. EVERYONE WILL LOVE THIS ALBUM! LOOK HOW MANY 5 STARS THIS HAS!! ANYONE will love this album I guarentee It. Just to let you know I am 19 and being young, I bet even younger kids will like it. Or else they have no clue what music is.

B000P2A24W|1.0|I was never a big fan of Bon Jovi, but when I heard they did a country cross over album I was intrigued.  I love southern rock and I figure maybe Bon Jovi could excel in that type of genre.  But of course, Bon Jovi is still Bon Jovi and this album is awful.  It sounds like over produced dribble.  The music at time can be catchy, but more in the way of a used car commercial.  The lyrics are absolutely painful to listen to.  Whoever is reviewing this as a good album really has no business offering opinions on music because clearly this is not a good album.
B00009ZYC1|1.0|Well, I think that I've pinpointed the reason I hate this movie: I hate the main character.  He's boisterous, rude, mean, disgusting, and that \\"soft side\\" of his that's displayed later doesn't even come close to redeeming him.  In fact, if anything, it's awkward to watch because no one likes a whiney lovesick person, and they're even worse when you already hate them... that and Mike Meyers is a bad actor when it comes to displaying angst.  I'm not saying that it's because Shrek's ugly.  In Shrek 2, when he's handsome, I still found him annoying and repulsive.  I have no idea why Fiona fell in love with him.  Not that I was that big a fan of Fiona either, mind you.    Oh, and I agree with the people who said that the film contradicts its message by making Fiona an ogre at the end.  If they really wanted to be subversive to the fairy tale movie genre, they should have had her stay pretty and marry the ogre anyway.  Shrek's message is the same as Beauty and the Beast's, only it's two ugly people (or ogres) instead or two beautiful ones.  Way to stick it to Disney... not.
0743496728|5.0|I found this novel incredibly moving and incredibly sad.  Picoult dealt with what is most certainly an issue that is very fresh in many people's minds and she did so without making it melodramatic and without making things too simple and neat.      I liked how the story was presented from multiple points of view and how the setting jumped from past to present and back again.  This enabled me to really get into the heads of the characters and to understand what it was that was motivating them.  It also enabled Picoult to sometimes turn things on their heads so that what once seemed obvious and ideal turned out to be something much more complex, just like real life.      I felt her handling of Josie and Matt's relationship was especially representative of this.  As a parent of a young child, reading this book often made me want to just hold and cuddle her and keep her where she is because I know what's coming for her.  The struggles of Josie and Peter were very authentic for me, their high school world very reflective of what exists out in the real world.      Picoult also did a superb job of detailing the parent/child relationships.  The parents in her book were not superhuman and sometimes did things that were petty and repugnant.  Picoult remembers that parents are people too and that they do and say things that they later really regret.  They are sometimes so fixated on their own problems that they're not attuned to those of their children.      In the end, I think Picoult makes no apologies for the actions of any of her characters.  The things they do are often incomprehensible and sometimes downright wrong so that the only thing left to do is to strive for acceptance and understanding.  The realities of Picoult's world are those of our own: life isn't always pretty and it isn't always fair but it is always full of possibilities.

B0002J4ZWS|5.0|If you've not seen this movie, you're long overdue.  It's a wonderful movie with moving performances by terrific actors.  There are lots of good extras on this Special Edition.
B0007Q6PBK|3.0|Bear with me here, I'll get to La Boheme in a minute (and I will also admonish my fellow reviewers).<br /><br />I've seen a lot of live operas and listened to a lot of opera CDs (and LPs), and one big, difference is that in a live production, it's only the singers' belted-out notes that the audience hears well. The softer notes leading up to and following those notes often are just barely audible above the orchestra. I think it's because one voice, no matter how well-trained, simply isn't as loud as a collection of instruments. And it seems that even the belted-out notes require a little cooperation from the orchestra in backing off a bit. On a CD (or LP for that matter), all sung notes are audible, because the singers have their faces inches from a good quality microphone. Call me corrupted by technology, but I like the CD sound better, except for whatever sound quality is lost in the recording process itself. The balance between the orchestra and the singers is better.<br /><br />Now, let's understand something about opera DVDs generally. You can't have opera singers holding microphones on camera. So there are two choices in getting the singers' voices recorded, neither of them perfect. One can try to record as they're performing, either live or on a set and in costume, using either a parabolic or shotgun microphone. This gives you perfect lip-sync, but sometimes gives you the out-of-balance sound typical of live performances (but not the clear distortion-free sound of a live performance).  I'm not sure why this happens; I think it must be because the microphone operator's aim isn't as good as it should be. The other option is to lip-sync, even if that means with the same person. This yields a more balanced sound, but sometimes the lip-sync-ing is not perfect, and sounds emerge from closed mouths. Personally, I prefer the latter, as I prefer the better sound balance, and can tolerate a little imperfection in the synchronization.<br /><br />This La Boheme, recording, like all the live @ the Met recordings, uses the parabolic or shotgun microphone  technique, with all the shortcomings that that implies. Pavarotti and Scotto are (well, were) among the best in the world, of course, and live up to their reputations--when you can hear them. All the minor-role singers are excellent too. The important duets toward the end of in Act 1 are mostly ok, but much of the singing-over-singing in Act 2 suffers from the poor-aim problem and is disappointing. You turn up the volume and just barely hear the lead-up, then are somewhat satisfied by the punch note, and then the following accompanying chord from the orchestra flattens your lampshades. Act 3 is OK, since there are fewer people singing at one time. Act 4 is pretty much the same for the same reason, with only a few faded sung notes. The last part of Act 4 was not a great turn-on for me, although I have to admit, I have more problems with Puccini on that issue than any singer, conductor, microphone operator, or recording engineer. I guess I just don't think drawn-out death scenes are amenable to great music. I feel the same way about the last parts of Traviata, Norma, and Carmen for that matter.  I find them tedious, but that's just me, I guess.<br /><br />The fidelity of the sound is ok, considering the age of the performance (at least on my equipment, a pretty good Klipsch 2.1 system--better than Bose but not really hi-fi). They must have cut the DVD from a pretty decent master tape.  They got a separate grant for \\"restoration,\\" so maybe that had something to do with it. However, throughout the opera there is some sort of a growl on the soundtrack that sounds a bit like muffled speech, as though there was a little leakage between the main microphone signals and the instructions from the director to the camera or microphone operators.<br /><br />The performance is really quite good, even if somewhat staid Met standard. I think I like the applause after the arias, duets, and at the ends of acts, although they let it go on a little too long. I have the DG Cosi (lip-synced) and, while it has excellent sound quality, it doesn't have applause, which I must admit, I miss. But I really could have done without Tony Randall's synopses--I just skipped over them (I'd have preferred Walter Matthau, but probably would have skipped over him too).  Of course, La Boheme doesn't really lend itself to the lavish staging that is so typical of Met productions, but, the sets are well done, and it's as good a Caf&eacute; Momus as I've seen anywhere.  The acting is as good as you'd expect. One minor goof that I was expecting was that Murphy's law would decree that among a bunch of actors complaining about being cold but singing their hearts under hot lights in a warm theatre, someone's bound to start sweating visibly. Indeed, it happens in Act 4 where, in the coat aria, Colline's face has quite a sheen on it.<br /><br />Well, OK, now to my admonishment. All you reviewers out there, you're not giving me everything I want. TELL ME ABOUT THE SOUND QUALITY! It's really important. When I read reviews, they tell me about everything else, and I'm getting tired of reading every review twice looking for something that isn't there. As far as I'm concerned, sound quality and singing artistry are the two most important features. Even if you do have the latter, you won't enjoy it unless you also have the former. When I pop that DVD in my machine and crank up the volume, I want to hear something close to a live performance in terms of crispness and frequency balance and not a distorted and/or muddy mess, as I have in so many opera DVDs. And I'm counting on you to tell me which I'll get. For example, this Boheme is a little turbid, spotty, but generally not muddy or too distorted. So, to summarize, despite a few shortcomings in the sound, there're still a few goosebumps in this DVD.<br /><br />Ciao<br /><br />Waylandlittle too long.

B000NVIXFK|5.0|My wife and I have been Rush fans since the 70's and we could not be more pleased and impressed with the latest CD from our favorite band.  We have every studio release and both of us believe Snakes and Arrows is one of the very best in a long line of top performances.  The music is excellent; the lyrics are meaningful and thought provoking.  Alex truly is able to show his superstar form with the various guitars used throughout the album.  Neal remains the absolute best drummer making new music today.  Geddy is able to show that a bass is much more than just providing a strong bottom end!!    For true fans of quality rock, you will not be disappointed.  Just play and enjoy!  This is a band that is unique in today's music world.  Rush deserves a place in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame.
B000O77RL4|1.0|Watched for 1hour 14 minutes in disappointment. The script is terrible. Don't make the mistake of watching this movie. Why all the hype? How can this be a Clint Eastwood directed movie? Firstly, this movie makes fun of sacrifice. It makes fun of the Japanese commitment to Japan. For sure I do not know precisely what happened at Iwo Jima, all I know is that 22000 fought till only 216 remained. That is a victory. As big as the firefighters of 9/11. It is something, it seems that Clint Eastwood, that willingly directed this movie, will never understand. Having no choice in life but to die honorably.    Iwo Jima was a last-stand before the enemy reached Japan, much like the Alamo. Soldiers don't harbor anti-war sentiment when your home and family is threatened - you pull together. Fight and die together. I didn't get the idea that there were 22000 soldiers on the island. The American forces were realistically depicted. This is a clear anti-war movie - only problem is that it makes fun of the commitment of a die-hard enemy facing destruction.

I did not like it when I saw it on fox because I never saw it in order. when I saw it on DVD I could not get enough. It all made fantastic sense. It was great fun. It also helps to have fun people to watch it with.

It seems Merchant was breaking out in her own way.  After all the 80's were over and they didn't do \\"My Mother the War\\". . .
B000M5AJQI|5.0|This may be Martin Scorsese's crowning achievement.  It did, after all, finally bring that elusive first, and very much deserved, Best Director Oscar.  The Departed goes straight to the top of my favorite Scorsese movies, ahead of [[ASIN:B000R8YC18 Taxi Driver (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]] and [[ASIN:B000286RKW GoodFellas (Two-Disc Special Edition)]].    The film centers around two men- one an undercover cop who infiltrates a Boston crimelord's gang, and the other a Massachusetts \\"Statey\\" who is secretly in the employ of that same Boston crimeboss.  Leonardo DiCaprio as the undercover, and Matt Damon as the crooked cop, are outstanding in these roles.     Both sides of the law soon discover that they have a mole in their organization, and efforts are made to learn his identity.  That's the main plot line, and Scorsese does a masterful job of building the tension to an almost unbearable level.  You will find yourself almost holding your breath as DiCaprio and Damon try to function in their respective worlds without being found out for who they are.    Supporting the leads is an all-star cast led by the incomparable Jack Nicholson as the kingpin of the Irish Mafia in Boston.  It's typical Jack, which is to say it's brilliant.  Mark Wahlberg received an Oscar nod for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of a sargeant in the Massachusetts State Police.  Also present are Martin Sheen and Alec Baldwin as police captains, and they do good work here.  But the rest of the cast is outstanding, too, as they play the balance of the cops and Irish Mafia members convincingly well.  There are no weak performances.    The movie contains strong, brutal violence and coarse language, but it isn't gratuitous.  It is necessary to the story and character development, and the stark, in-your-face manner in which it is presented pulls the viewer emotionally into the lives of those men perpetrating the violence and suffering it.    I enjoyed everything about this movie- even the musicis a joy- and repeat viewings further my appreciation of an expertly crafted piece of film making.  The Blu-ray disc is of course beautiful, and has good extras included, but any version of this movie is going to make you happy you bought it.  It is an instant classic by one of the greatest American directors ever.

B0007XT87G|5.0|Where is prog rock today?  Just listen to this CD and you'll find out.  PT, along with Dream Theater and some select others, are paving the way to new heights in \\"Prog Rock\\" - a term that most would relate to 'boring' or 'dead' stuff today.  Thankfully, there are a legion of fans that don't exactly want good Prog Rock to go away!!    PT stretches into new territory with Deadwing.  Some heavy, some soft, and all beautifully composed.  The overall flow of this CD seems to come together better than the brilliant 'In Absentia', more like a heavier 'Stupid Dream'.  My main frustration with 'In Absentia' is that the masterpiece moments were injected with 2 or 3 tracks that should have been left in the studio - not so with Deadwing.  Mind you, there is no 'Even Less' or 'Blackest Eyes', but this CD grabs you from start to finish, bending new curves into the prog rock landscape.    If you enjoy this CD's mellower moments, check out the Wilson's 'Blackfield' side project - it's great stuff!!  In the meantime, add this gem to your shopping cart NOW!

B000MXPE7O|1.0|Wow - I like all kinds of movies, and thought the combination of story, DiNiro and a great cast would make this a great flick...NOT.  This is one of the most boring, overly complex and simply crappy movie I have ever seen.  I thought the Larry the Cable Guy disaster 'Health Inspector' was the bottom of the barrel - we just found a new bottom with this one.      The main problem I find with this movie is the total focus on the dedicated, dull character Matt Damon plays.  Mind you, there are a few great moments (especially when he talks to Pesci), but just no enough to make this 'compelling'.  Acutally, when I see that word describing a movie on the box, I tend to think that this is really the only verb one could use because 'good' would be a stretch!    With all the really great and even mediocre movies out there, pass on this one...you'll be glad you did.
B00005JPFC|5.0|Pixar has knocked a lot of them out of the ball park: [[ASIN:B0009MAO46 Toy Story (10th Anniversary Edition)]], [[ASIN:B000B8QG0O Toy Story 2 (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], [[ASIN:B00005JKDR Monsters, Inc. (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], and several others.  I felt though that Pixar had over reached itself this time.  The trailer for Ratatouille felt crampy and superficial.  I said I wouldn't be seeing it but sort of accidentally wound up watching the film.  It has a depth and scope which is impressive.  It moves between the sewer and a classy restaurant, smoothly weaving together the tale of a boy and a rat.  It has a lot of emotion, and more impressive animation than [[ASIN:B00005JM02 Finding Nemo (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]].  I would highly recommend this to any Pixar fan; don't be scared off by the trailer.
B000056VPD|2.0|Unfortunately on this DVD, Benson seems to have been an addition to the BBC Big band /Orchestra rather than the other way round. The male drummer and 2nd guitarist are the only backing singers and are absolutely useless at it, completely unable to reach the highs most notably in \\"Give me the night\\" which just sound ridiculous. Bizarrely it looks like someone thought it would be a good idea to have middle aged women dancing in the front, one of whom cringemakingly gets up on stage bumping and grinding while Benson struggles to carry on not knowing what she is going to do next. Benson looks like a fish out of water throughout the whole thing and just plays completely unenthusiastically, looking like he can't wait to finish it. AVOID this, get the Montreux DVD and hope for a new tour and accompanying DVD a LOT better than this one!!

0345347951|5.0|I am simply not a science fiction reader. But a friend whom I respect very much gave me his copy for summer reading. My only previous contact with Mr Clarke's work was seeing the film \\"2001\\" some years ago, and it left me somewhat baffled, but intrigued. This book was a real page-turner for me. I stayed up half the night to finish it, because the story pulled me in so deeply. It's rare that I find a book so involving. Clarke's visions and descriptions seem so natural and real that the story simply doesn't seem to be work of fiction, but more an account of actual events.<br /><br />Needless to say, I intend to put more of Arthur C. Clarke's works on my \\"to read\\" list.
0618711678|4.0|Positives:  Detailed, readable history about Belgium's Scramble for Africa in the Congo.  Hochschild does an excellent job of introducing key figures who aid King Leopold in getting 'his colony' in Africa as well as those who fought against the Belgian King's enslavement of the Congolese people.  In addition, Hochschild intersperses the general experience of the colonizers and the Congolese with personal stories from sadistic colonizers, missionaries, the King's lobbyists, and most critically, some of the 10 million people devastated by King Leopold II's obsession.     Negatives:  Hochschild often distracts from the history he is so effectively telling through tangential introductions of more contemporary history and through personal analysis of historical events being presented.  His personal analysis interrupts the pace of the history being told, and causes suspiscion about how the author chose to use the facts he researched.

B000062X90|5.0|We all have those cd's that sit forever next to the player and never make it back onto the rack.  Ever since I discovered Argus it has taken on a prominent place in that frequently played pile.  My discovery of this album while browsing Amazon was quite by accident and up until that moment I had never even heard of the band.  But after reading the reviews I decided to give it a shot.  What I found was an early 1970' gem that's equal parts bluesy and progressive with great vocal harmonies and a guitar duo that should be ranked amoung the best that rock has ever seen.  It can be held up as a perfect example of \\"the album\\".  Not just a collection of songs, but one of those rare moments in history when everything clicks, the material, the performence, the recording, the packaging, everything sits tightly and flawlessly together.  The three live bonus tracks are a little more raw than the studio material, but when compared to other live recordings of the day, they bear witness to the fact that Wishbone Ash was just as capable on stage as in the studio.  It's certainly the place to start if you're at all interested in this band, the only downside being that their other albums-as great as many of them are-all have to live up to this recording.

She doesn't act here like she did with \\"Pretty Woman\\", \\"I Love Trouble\\", or for that matter: \\" America Sweethearts\\", \\"Sleeping With The Enemy\\", or \\"Hook\\". There's one thing missing that's in all the movies I mentioned, and that's Julia's laughter. That laugh of hers as far as I'm concerned has become her trademark. Actors and Actresses all have a trademark as far as I'm concerned. George Burns always and forever had a stogey in his mouth, Groucho Marx always with those wire-rimmed glasses, and Julia Roberts with her laugh. However, don't think because she doesn't laugh in this movie that means it isn't good, on the contrary this shows her ability to drop her Georgian accent, and trade it for an almost Irish accent, but it also shows her ability to act in crossover films which prepared her for an I believe an Oscar nomination for supporting actress for the film \\"Stepmom\\". The story line I will have to look into this further, and see if Robert Louis Stevenson had a character named Mary Reilly in his story \\"Dr. Jekyll and Mister Hyde\\". If it's not it's still a good suspensful flick.

0061191981|5.0|If you are seriesly into cooking and striving for the next step, but need some inspiration READ THIS BOOK.  It is way past him humilulating some accountant on FOX so they can win some cash or get there 15 minutes of fame.  This is Ramsay the Chef.  From his humbling back ground to him being apart of the biggest thing to hit the British Culinary scene ever with Harveys. Think hes a maniac and no one would work for him with that attiude.  Read about him leaving to open his own place and TWO complete reastaurants walked out on their jobs to work for him.  It is a great book if you are in the field or not.  It also sheds some light on his colorful manor we have all seen on TV.  So maybe it is time for us to hear his side.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|Despite lots of misgivings regarding the non-improvement of image quality by som reviewers this is a pretty essential purchase. All 3 seasons of the original Star Trek series. Ok it is not a complete bargain but it is not overexpensive. The packaging is based on the European boxed sets that were produced for the other Trek series. One main advatgae is that since they are made out of hard plastic, they do not damage as easily as other current DVD boxes. Having never seen all episodes, this was quite a revelation. In the beginning of series 1, as has been written, all the characters have not come into place into what would become the classic series. The acting is also quite wooden at times. However it is the screenwriting that is quite good. I had never seen The Menagerie for example and I am not sure that that double episode was the best way to salvage the footage from the \\"lost\\" pilot The Cage. However all the trademarks of future ST adventures are to be found and it is a pleasure to watch. I do not find the picture quality as bad as some say. I found it worse on the first Next Generation DVD for example. The sound is great also and there are some nice features also so one cannot really complain. It is beautiful and I finally get to see the whole series.

The author and publisher are getting rich because people think that it contains the \\"secrets\\" that will give them what they want.

This book is truly tragic,romantic,and endearing in Sparks' signature style.<br /><br />The relationship of John and Savannah was truly wonderful to read about.  I loved reading about how a boy finally became a man and the steps it took for him to get there.  I thought that John and Savannah were gonna get married and just grow old together but of course,there's always a curve ball that Nicholas Sparks always pitches to his readers whether you see it or not.<br /><br />This book is another awesome read from Nicholas Sparks.  I can't wait to read his next novel.
B000NVIGC0|5.0|I don't know what else there is to say about this album except that it's simply incredible.  This is Wilco at it's finest form, and together they have created a flawless piece of work.  The songwriting is strong as usual, the band is very tight (having recording the album live-in-the-studio with few overdubs), the production is great, and even the packaging and presentation are well done.  There is not one thing that I would change.  That being said, I want to comment on any other reviewers who might call this album \\"dull,\\" \\"boring,\\" \\"a step back,\\" or \\"uninspired.\\"  Sure this is more like the Wilco of old and lacks the experimental sounds prevalent on \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" and \\"A Ghost is Born,\\" but the result is equally awe-inspiring and worthy of praise.  I love both of those albums, but Wilco has managed to strip down the layers of sound to reveal the core of their talent.  Only Wilco can do so much and say so much in one song.  You can hear everything going on musically, and can sense Jeff Tweedy's thought process.  Wilco is growing up.  They are not trying to appeal to the trendy or \\"indie\\" crowd that popularized their most recent two albums.  They are just doing what they do best, and I wouldn't want it any other way.    If you have a few extra bucks, make sure you buy the Deluxe edition with the DVD.  It's worth the price of the album alone.

B00002SWEM|5.0|I'm a fan of old Cuban music, and I found it amazing how this incredible talent was reawakend to full bloom instantaneously when Ry Cooder put it together in this documentary. I had enjoy the CD, but had not had the opportunity to watch and enjoy the old timers in the video. Compay Segundo has been a Cuban legend since he first appeared in the scene in the '30s. I had no idea he was still alive. Thanks to Mr. Cooder for giving him a few days of happiness, and sharing him with us one more time. The greates revelations for me though was Rubén González at the piano who seemed to have not lost one ounce of his brilliance after all these years even with arthritis and little practice, and Ibrahim Ferrer whose voice kept as fresh as when he was a teenager. Simply amazing!

B00004VVND|3.0|I believe given the limits of special Fx at the time it was made, this was a good film with an intriguing premise. I doubt we will see any remake of it for the simple fact that we dont have any actor who could convincingly play the iconic gunslinger brought to life by Brynner.   I had not seen the movie in years. I was mistaken in thinking that Delos was set up to be a vacation fantasy land set up for the super rich and powerful. We're told early on that the guests pay about $1,000 per day for their time in Westworld and the two main characters are obviously well off (One is recently divorced, the other's marital status unclear)  The first reviewer gave a well beyond adequate explanation of the difficulties of animatronic robot technology. I wont steal his thunder here. I think if a remake were to be done I'd have many changes.  Upon arrival at Delos-- but prior to changing clothes and getting into character/role playing mode-- guests would get to see a robot assembly and design area. Seeing technicians go from a steel framed skeleton with movable, programmable limbs and digits all the way to a semi-convincing character (cowboy, saloon hooker, medieval knight etc) would be neat. The guests would get the same type guided tour as the Attenborough character gave the guests at Jurassic Park, only at the end I'd have the guests discover that their tourguide narrator was in fact a robot as well. So far the only convincing robots actually in existence are in japan. (I saw the \\"girl\\" and she looked convincing at least from a distance)  Instead of the one deranged cowboy gunman, I think I might have multiple character robots go nuts, but I'd have them ea confined to a particular zone where they would receive programming signals from miniature cell antennas or something similar. That the gunslinger could go all the way to the Roman World seemed a bit far-fetched; seems like you'd engineer him so that he'd only go so far until his tower reception quit.     It might have also been better if robotic machines had been the repairers of the \\"killed\\" machines, that could have been the origin of the virus.  I'm a little incredulous that synthetic beings could ever be designed and built with which a man might choose to have sex. I think I would rework the saloon girl hookers part of the film as well.
B000O75F7C|4.0|If Porcupine tree were prodigal musicians, we'd have perfection on our hands. But let us not forget... there's no such thing as perfect. Within the context of Steven Wilson's vision, it's an A+. So you can't touch him - he knows what he is after, and I'm convinced that he gets it. But to insert objectivity into a review, it must be from the global perspective. How does this perform on a broad musical spectrum?     And again I find myself yearning for just a bit more musicianship - not much - but a bit. Perhaps this is made obvious when viewed against the more definitive perfection of the lyrics. In my book, lyrics have always been about 40% the weighting, with the music being responsible for the 60%. So lyrics alone don't carry an album (do you hear that Bob Dylan????). But they damn near do on this one.  What is so amazing in Porcupine Tree's music is that it truly takes you on a journey, on an adventure. The careful attention to detail in the ambient soundscapes enhance and solidify the legitimacy of Wilson's exploration of mental disorder, topics of isolation, depression, and... well just count how many times he returns to address \\"pills\\". Quite a bittersweet and brutally realistic testimonial on life's effects on the human condition. I relate 100%.     So again, perhaps it is this complete identifiability in the subject matter that gives me the feeling of mild let-down musically. Lines such as \\"It's no fun to be told that you can't blame your parents anymore\\" beg for a rollercoaster of melody, a cacophony of crashing chords, something....     But rather, strictly musically speaking, there's a wanting. And maybe that's the point. But I've always held the Tree a bit higher musically, dare I say, than even Pink Floyd or Radiohead themselves. This album finds good company in such idioms, but doesn't quite truly transcend. It's an hour of similarly repetitive ideas that too often recall the monotonous drones a la U2, and not often enough does it break out. It's greatzone-out music, but nothing Floyd hasn't taken to glorious heights some 30 years ago. A little more distinctiveness and identity to the songs as individuals would give the album more contrast and as a result, more impact. It's a body of work that gets deeper with each listen, but you have to want it.    Which I do.

Okay, then I found a copy in a used record store and grabbed it to keep in the car.  That's what happened with me and \\"Heavy Weather.\\"     \\"Birdland\\" drew me into the CD, but there's so much more than this one song to listen to.

B0009A1AS2|2.0|Where is my METAL? I have to admit I'm not a long time fan of Dream Theater.  I do like Heavy Metal and Progressive Rock.  I heard \\"Pull Me Under\\" off Images and Words on the radio and was quite impressed.  I bought that first album and liked it.  Picked up Train of Thought also, very good and similar to I&W.<br /><br />I am continually researching bands/music on the internet, and then buying that music, mostly off Amazon.com  When I saw Dream Theater was coming out with a new album, I thought \\"Great, can't wait to pick it up.\\"<br /><br />Well, was I ever disappointed!  The first couple of times I tried listening to it, I think I must of fallen asleep.  Each time I would come away with the same impression: A bunch of Symphonic crap!  What happened to the Progressive Metal band known as Dream Theater?  Now, I know bands \\"evolve\\" and change over time, but come on.  This was ridiculous.<br /><br />Octavarium starts off OK, the first track rocks just enough to put the listener to ease, makes you think \\"OK, they still have it, this sounds pretty cool, but I hope it gets better.\\"  Next thing you know they go into a full Ballad.  Nothing but a Piano and Orchestration!  It just goes downhill from there.  By the 4th track I'm having visions of Dream Theater being featured on late night TV programming for one of those Faith-based, Christain Rock music programs with shots of hundreds of people singing in unison with their hands in the air!  I do realize (now) that DT is considered a Christian Rock band, but it used to just be no more than an \\"undertone\\", now it's up front and \\"in your face\\".<br /><br />Panic Attack is a little more heavy, pretty close to the Dream Theater of old.  Never Enough is OK.  But, by track 7 they're letting me down... again!  Too much orchestration, just mindless and repetitive.<br /><br />Finally, we get to the great Octavarium, a four part, 24 minute epic.  The first few minutes evoke memories of Pink Floyd's - Wish You Were Here.  This just isn't the type of DT that I want.  This stuff has already been done, by other (better) bands!<br /><br />This is Definately my LAST Dream Theater album.  Systematic Chaos - NO Thanks.  I've already read enough reviews that say it is simply \\"more of the same\\".  What a Pity.  At least I still have my Porcupine Tree cd's to enjoy.f has already been done, by other (better) bands!    This is Definately my LAST Dream Theater album.  Systematic Chaos - NO Thanks.

0143038419|2.0|A few folks in my office sang this books praises- and I thought it sounded interesting and wanted to see what the fuss was about. And the fuss and praise was right and good up to a point. The point where I grew tired of it. I got through Italy, just barely- because I got fed up with the weeping and carrying on about the non-commital artist (He's Just Not Into You) and part of India and put the book down because honestly I stopped caring, not about the journey, but the self absorbed overwrought and pathologically needy person making it. She must be exhausting to be around for extended periods is all I could think somewhat guiltily because America seems to be in love with her and I just wanted her to shut up and show some backbone.   The Ex husband must have gotten some good lawyering because as much as she talks about telling the truth, there a huge chunks of it left out and if you listen closely enought to the prose and story line you can hear a whole orchestra playing the song of the story that got away.   So anyway..I did read a couple of other books and then said, c'mon finish it- you actually went to a bookstore and paid for this, with money..so pick it up let's see where she goes. The problem is not with the writing- it is funny, engaging and voluminous. She captures aspects of depression and faith brilliantly. I had a problem with the narrator. She exhausted me with her weeping, crying, tantruming, weeping, fretting, obsessing over men. men. men. (She reminds me of one of those folks- you know the kind- they are always around for awhile for laughs, to drink, light your cigarette, talk on the phone for hours, talk for hours about their problems usually, their issues but when, but when fortune in the form a relationship knocks they vanish.) She went to Indonesia for a guru but met a father, I mean fella and it was sayonara Guru, I'll catch you after my UTI clears up.   After a while- I found myself saying. Elizabeth, for Christ sake get a hold of yourself. Enough already. Meditation must have been difficult, she had to move her third eye away from her self. I loaned the book to my friend Margaret. She said she read some of Italian section but found it too taxing and has abandoned it.

B00006L7XQ|5.0|I honestly can't say I like country music. I just don't care for most of the genre. The only artist from this genre that I do listen to is Johnny Cash. Of  all of the American recordings Johnny has worked on with record producer Rick Rubin, American IV: The Man Comes Around\\" is easily my personal favorite. As much as I like Johnny's last album American V, I just didn't think the material held up as well as the fourth volume.<br /><br />What I love about American IV: The Man Comes Around is the sparse, haunting melodies that lingers through out the album. Secondly I love Johnny's deep baritone vocals on this cd especially on his covers of \\"Hurt\\" and \\"I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry\\". One of my personal favorite tracks is Johnny's cover of the Nine Inch Nails' track \\"Hurt\\". The emotions he puts into the song really moved me. I also loved the Sting song \\"I Hung My Head\\". Johnny does a great job at storytelling through this song. His voice is so warm and deep on this track. Johnny's duet with Nick Cave on the Hank Williams' classic \\"I'm so Lonesome I Could Cry\\" is absolutely stunning. Both men really compliment each other with their own deep vocals.<br /><br />While I do like Johnny's other American recordings, they weren't as perfect to me as American IV: The Man Comes Around is. I can listen to this cd without skipping a single track.
B000M341QE|4.0|There are things I liked about Martin Scorcese's The Departed - it's grittiness, the tough, Irish Boston atmosphere, the dialogue, most of the performances (particularly Alec Baldwin, Ray Winstone, DiCaprio and MATT DAMON) and the plot which, despite some holes, is engaging.  Having said all that, The Departed is good but far from great.  Why?  It's shallow, none of the characters have any real depth to them, it's flabby and bloated, Jack Nicholson is basically on over-the-top , one-dimensional cruise control, and the closing shot of the film with the rat is completely unnecessary and possibly one of the clumsiest attempts at symbolism I've ever seen in a film.  I also think the camera work was good, but wasn't up to par with Scorcese's previous work, and the quick editing bothered me after a while.  I think the most disappointing thing about the Departed is that after you finish it you're entertained but at the same time you're left feeling that the film should and could easily be a lot better than it is. 3 1/2 stars out of five.

Rush is the only band that I know who have changed their style with each and every CD. Take for instance, ROLL THE BONES, add a little bit of this, experiment a little bit with that, and there you have SNAKES AND ARROWS.    Rush are musically consistent with this CD. A continual sound of, to me, quality thought in both lyrics and musicianship. There are four stages of RUSH's career, mix all four, and it turns out to be this excellent CD.   SNAKES AND ARROWS is a breath of fresh air. I purchased this, and did not waste my money. Neither will you.

0385522401|5.0|It takes a specially gifted author to present a young couple on their wedding night as an intriguing subject for a whole novel.  McEwan has achieved this with this short, intense and engrossing tale.  For many readers above a certain age it will trigger memories and reflections of their own first love, first kiss and physical intimacy. Younger readers might take a different approach to the events. By placing the main event of his story into a precise time and locale, he gives his characters a high level of credibility.<br /><br />The novel centres on Florence and Edward, both virgins, who have been waiting for months with great anticipation and anxiety for this, their wedding day. The emotions, however, are very different for each. Edward has been holding back his desires and the pressure is almost too much to bear. Florence, on the other hand, is close to panicky and doesn't know how to handle this first sexual encounter. Until now she has withdrawn from every intimate approach that Edward attempted. The tension in their wedding suite is palpable.  While their go through the motions of their formal dinner with mediocre food served by uncaring waiters, their minds are clearly on what will shortly have to happen in the bedroom next door.<br /><br />The narrative alternates between his and her thoughts and expectations. Through flashbacks we learn about their backgrounds and upbringing and what brought them together to this eventful evening. Florence and Edward, while both middle class, reflect the very wide spread that this encompasses. Florence comes from an upper middle class family where, importantly, the mother is also an academic and Florence has everything she needs, except family intimacy. Her own professional ambitions are aimed at performing successfully with her own classical music quartet.  Edward is a future historian with little serious interest in music. His upbringing has been marred by his mother's brain damage after an accident, leaving his father as the sole caregiver for the family.  Rural and urban environments add to the gulf between the two lovers in all but their attraction for each other.  What do they have in common?  Since their chance encounter, their romance flourished gently and slowly.  Both have their standpoint of what their marriage will bring: freedom at last from the restrictions of family and social custom. Unfortunately, neither has learned how to share their dreams with the other and too many things are left unsaid.  But communication is essential in working through differences and to create harmony between lovers and couples. Will they ever learn?<br /><br />McEwan is a master wordsmith. He creates atmospheres and landscapes that mirror the emotional state his characters find themselves in.  His economy of language and precise descriptions bring out all we need to know about the two characters and their backgrounds. The flashbacks flow easily into the narrative of the wedding night. Hinting at actual political events, such as through radio news downstairs in the hotel, the author establishes a realistic context for this time period, the early 1960s. McEwan extends his story to briefly outline what happened in the couple's life over the next decades, seen from Edward's perspective.

B000LC4TJ0|5.0|One cannot say that the majority of the reviews here are wrong, but that they--like this one--are merely opinions.  Interestingly, many of the reasons they give for not liking the production and conducting are the same reasons I would give for it being quite overwhelming.  As usual, when Harnoncourt reverses expections, it produces shcoked reactions.  This, surely, will gain the reputation as THE Figaro production that shows up the superficialities of most other producitions: the one that all the others will have to take into account.  Harnoncourt has always argued (rather than merely believed) that the tempi adopted in most productions of Figaro are usually taken too fast, especially taken in relation to the other two da Ponte operas.  Not only that, but that most productions ignore the specific relations of tempi within this particular opera and arbitrarily decide the tempo of each piece without taking into account the tempi of all the other pieces in the work.    Harnoncourt has also pointed that NONE of the da Ponte operas end happily; rather they open up chasms in the intertwined relationships between the characters that will hardly disappear after the curtain falls at the end.  Desparate (in the sense of despair) is his word for it.  This production takes these ideas to heart and provides the antidote to all those productions that think of Figaro as a proto-Rossini comic opera.  Translating these ideas into theatrical terms, Guth's production comes over, in fact, as visually very beautiful.  The characters are more like ghosts haunting this deserted oversized empty house, and who constantly play out the \\"desparate\\" relationship games that da Ponte and Mozart and Guth and Harnoncourt have designed for them.  They are frozen in time at the beginning, and at the end Cherubino, the Count's doppelganger who just wants to love but who is the catalyst for exposing the emotional chasms both within and between the charaters, falls down dead.  The music is directed withsuch intensity and, indeed, with a much greater variety of tempi than usual so that every moment counts.  As usual with Harnoncourt the lines are very cleanly articualted and he brings out elements of the orchestration largely ignored heretofore.  All five leads are among the best of contemporary singers, and deliver their performances--both musically and theatrically--accordingly.  And the Vienna Philharmonic is, of course, sans pareil.

My estimation of KWS as a performer  and good guy increased by a quantum leap after seeing the show.  He may be one the best guitarists I've ever seen live, and he   respectfully kept that fierce talent in check when the others were   stepping out. He seems a real gentleman as well as lover of the   music and the people.    The package is excellent, a real gem. The interviews and background  materials are touching, especially of the folks that have since passed.    BUY THIS CD. THESE GUYS ARE THE REAL DEAL. YOU WON'T BE SORRY!

For example, Gore claims that Himalayan glaciers are shrinking and global warming is to blame. Yet the September 2006 issue of the American Meteorological Society's Journal of Climate reported, \\"Glaciers are growing in the Himalayan Mountains, confounding global warming alarmists who recently claimed the glaciers were shrinking and that global warming was to blame.\\"    Gore claims the snowcap atop Africa's Mt. Kilimanjaro is shrinking and that global warming is to blame. Yet according to the November 23, 2003, issue of Nature magazine, \\"Although it's tempting to blame the ice loss on global warming, researchers think that deforestation of the mountain's foothills is the more likely culprit. Without the forests' humidity, previously moisture-laden winds blew dry. No longer replenished with water, the ice is evaporating in the strong equatorial sunshine.\\"    Gore claims global warming is causing more tornadoes. Yet the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change stated in February that there has been no scientific link established between global warming and tornadoes.    Gore claims global warming is causing more frequent and severe hurricanes. However, hurricane expert Chris Landsea published a study on May 1 documenting that hurricane activity is no higher now than in decades past. Hurricane expert William Gray reported just a few days earlier, on April 27, that the number of major hurricanes making landfall on the U.S. Atlantic coast has declined in the past 40 years. Hurricane scientists reported in the April 18 Geophysical Research Letters that global warming enhances wind shear, which will prevent a significant increase in future hurricane activity.    Gore claims global warming is causing an expansion of African deserts. However, the Sept. 16, 2002, issue of New Scientist reports, \\"Africa's deserts are in 'spectacular' retreat . . . making farming viable again in what were some of the most arid parts of Africa.\\"    Gore argues Greenland is in rapid meltdown, and that this threatens to raise sea levels by 20 feet. But according to a 2005 study in the Journal of Glaciology, \\"the Greenland ice sheet is thinning at the margins and growing inland, with a small overall mass gain.\\" In late 2006, researchers at the Danish Meteorological Institute reported that the past two decades were the coldest for Greenland since the 1910s.    Gore claims the Antarctic ice sheet is melting because of global warming. Yet the Jan. 14, 2002, issue of Nature magazine reported Antarctica as a whole has been dramatically cooling for decades. More recently, scientists reported in the September 2006 issue of the British journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society Series A: Mathematical, Physical, and Engineering Sciences, that satellite measurements of the Antarctic ice sheet showed significant growth between 1992 and 2003. And the U.N. Climate Change panel reported in February 2007 that Antarctica is unlikely to lose any ice mass during the remainder of the century.    Each of these cases provides an opportunity for Gore to lead by example in his call for an end to the distortion of science. Will he rise to the occasion? Only time will tell.    Above is from the Chicago Suntimes.    Gore said he invented the internet and made many other typical-of-a-politician claims.     The earth's climate has fluctuated for thousands and thousands of years. Are we to suppose that today's climate is THE perfect range for us humans as opposed to the climate of 500 years ago or 1000 years ago?    Global warming has been occuring since the end of the last ice age.    Buy an electric car and save the planet. If it makes you feel good about yourself...  Postmodernism at it's finest.     The Global Warming movement has become a religion with it's followers blindly following their leader(s). Take notice of how defensive and emotional people get when their \\"religion\\" is questioned.     Whatever happened to critical thinking??
0743298020|4.0|Two minus one equals zero.  Two plus one equals two.  This is the arithmetic of twins according to Diane Setterfield's [[ASIN:0743298020 The Thirteenth Tale: A Novel]].<br /><br />This novel is an homage to [[ASIN:0451526554 Jane Eyre (Signet Classics)]].  Three characters (the tutor, the author, and the biographer) take turns playing the role of the literate, lovelorn heroine.  And as in Bronte's masterpiece, the climax of the novel is a fire that destroys an extranumerary family presence.<br /><br />This is a very low-key Gothic novel, with uniformly shallow characterizations, a cozy ghost-scape, and a very mild sense of foreboding.  Setterfield adds a superficial exploration of the psychology of twin-ness.  It seems that if you take away one (or add another) the remainder is always two - or noone at all.
0385522401|4.0|His timing for the debut of this book is perfect, I think. Even if it wasn't planned to come out now, I think it is the right time for people to reflect on the Sexual Revolution and the time just before it reached its peak. Why? Because it has had unexpected consequences and a comparison between then and now might be enlightening. This novel provides some basis for comparison.<br />  The couple at the heart of this novel aren't lucky enough to meet when<br />sexuality is a common topic of conversation. It is worth a look back to see how far we've come (or have we?) when it comes to sex, love and marriage.<br />  I haven't loved all of McEwan's books but I did like this one quite a bit. I also recommend Atonement. Even when I didn't relate to one of his books, I found him to be a superb writer. He is so multi-faceted and covers so many subjects that it is hard to relate to  EVERY book he writes, but I always look forward to his next, wondering what subject he'll explore next.
0743464117|4.0|The Band of Brother book is the more complete story of Easy company focusing much more on the personal details of the idividuals as they journeyed towards the occupation of Germany.  Anyone who was intrigued by the movie will enjoy this book as it expands on many of the details of battle from the personal point of view of the soldiers who experienced it.  The book weighs heavily on LT. Winters who commanded Easy company and much on Pvt. Webster due to his eloquence with desribing war despite the fact that he was not in the Bastogne campaign for which the 101st became infamous.    Over all it is good and captivating read but if you are looking for the ultimate story of battle for the 101st read the Donald Burgett series of books (4 in all) that describe his personal exploits in A company of the 506th.
0553208845|4.0|This was an amazing book. Siddhartha's journey was intense, and he experienced more in one lifetime than most could ever even dream of. The only thing that would have made it better is if there was a more concrete ending. Then again, maybe the abstract ending fits with Siddhartha's personality and beliefs.....
B000002UB6|5.0|And I don't really know why.  It has some of the Beatles' better songs on it, and it's a pretty cohesive album on the whole.  Yes, it does seem that Spector can be accused of overproduction; it would have undoubtedly been better if Martin produced it.  Don't pass this album  up--it's essential to anyone's catalog.
B000P0J024|4.0|This is great news for the recording industry. At last, after so many years being in my wish list,  the Traveling Wilburys CDs are available to everyone in a wonderful remastering version by Rhino. The first day this box came out, the Deluxe version was selling by only $24,99 at Amazon. I did not buy it right away, and after a couple of weeks, it was already sold out. Big mistake. Then the Digipak version came out for the same price. The Deluxe version was gone and only available at other websites for no less than $50,00. After doing some research, I decided to get this version and the first thing I felt when I had it in my hands was 'Is that it?'. Honestly, I was expecting a bigger box, a 'bigger piece of a cake'. If you look at the images available here on Amazon, the one in the right depicts exactly what this box looks like. After that very first moment, I eagerly opened the box, took out the third disc, and play it on my DVD player. Another surprise! I thought the third disc was the DVD, but no! The third disc is the second album Volume 3. Well ... that one made sense. So I played the second disc and watched part of the movie and the videoclips 'Handle with Care' and 'End of the Line'. That is all I needed!!! Those two songs are a masterpiece. They also bring me so many great memories from the eighties. Just for those two songs, this Box Set is worth the price. But then there is the music, which is what this is all about. I am giving this Box Set 4 stars for a reason: the music -all of it- does not deserve 5 stars. It is true that there has been a lot of expectation over this set, and I strongly recommend it to anyone who wants to complete his/her discography. But after listening to the two CDs, I think 4 stars is a fair rate. For example, the song 'Margarita' in Volume 1 is below average according to my standards. Also, only the two songs I mentioned above are 5 stars to me; the rest go from 3 to 4 stars. So I could not give the music in here 5 stars. Volume 1 is overall, and in my opinion, better than Volume 3 (Orbison passed away in December 1988, so he does not appear in this album). The first CD includes two previously unissued bonus tracks: 'Maxine' (Beatles sound), and 'Like a Ship' (Dylan sound?). Volume 3 also includes 2 extra tracks: 'Nobody's Child' (country sound), and 'Runaway' (a song that sounds so sixties that you would not believe this is sung by the TW).<br />The Traveling Wilburys were one of those magic bands very hard to put together. The five members of it were great stars on their own, so in these circumstances is very remarkable they were all able to leve their ego by the door and give themselves completely to the music. It is true that we all have our preferences, and Lynne may not be the favorite one, but I still have great respect for him since he writes, plays, sings and produces this music (and actually 'created' the band with Harrison by recording the B-Side 'Handle with Care' for Harrison's single 'This Is Love'), so he must be given the credit as well as the other four members. The combination of their voices is just magic. When I hear Dylan and Petty singing together the chorus in 'Handle with Care', I am absolutely mesmerized and transformed by the magic of R'N'R. And the majesty of Orbison, the mastery of Harrison ...<br />The DVD is a must. Fiver stars at least. It includes all five video clips the band recorded and the documentary 'The True History of the Traveling Wilburys', which is pretty good and gives us an insight of the band at work. I can't tell you about image quality because I don't know anything about it, but to me this DVD is more than what I could ask for and it satisfies all my needs.<br />This Digipak includes a booklet titled 'The True History of the Traveling Wilburys', which contains an introduction by Mo Ostin (he says this album was in the list of the Top 100 Albums by the Rolling Stone Magazine, which is half true; it appears in the Top 100 Albums of the 80s of theRS magazine, not in the list of the 500 Greatest Albums ever published by RS 12/11/2003), two articles about the history of the TW (which is of course all fiction and I did not particulary like), credits (in Volume 1 the bass player is missing), an article on how to dance the Wilbury Twist, and several pictures of the band. The lyrics are not included, which would have been nice. If you find the Deluxe edition and can afford it, go for it! It includes a 40-page bound book, a numbered certificate of authenticity, a backstage pass, photos and postcards.<br />Bottomline: At last this CDs becomes available.

B000MRAAJM|3.0|I fell in love with this series when I saw it on Discovery HD this year. It is visually spectacular. I thought Discovery simply re-aired this BBC version, but there are 2 major differences between these versions.    1. The narrator on this blu-ray is David Attenborough, not Sigourney Weaver. I've read many reviews of people preferring Attenborough, but I must say I find Sigourney much easier on the ears, and I found this version disappointing.    2. The video quality on this blu-ray pales in comparison to what Discovery HD aired. Discovery's version is noticeably sharper and pops out of the screen (better color/contrast etc). It's clear that Discovery did a lot of re-mastering before they aired it. While the content is mostly the same, this video does not pack the same \\"punch\\" that the Discovery HD version did. It's soft and washed out by comparison.    I also noticed some other differences, like different music and some editing changes. These are less important but worth noting.    In summary, if you fell in love with the Discovery HD version, then wait until they release it on blu-ray.
B00005JPHT|5.0|First of all, let me just say that I am 13 years old. Yet, this does not mean that I am so ignorant as to not know what goes on in the business of healthcare. I stay on top of political issues, and I read the news regularly to see what's going on in our world.<br /><br />So, naturally, I've grown accustomed to Michael Moore's ideas and, when I heard of his new film \\"Sicko\\" that would exploit everything wrong with America's healthcare system, I got excited.<br /><br />I saw Sicko last night and let me say right now that it does not disappoint. Michael Moore has created a painfully truthful documentary that seriously opens your eyes to yet another thing America lacks: true care for people who are sick and can't afford it. Moore takes us on a 2 hour long trip interviewing people and discovering their horror stories about their health insurance companies refusing to cover their necessary health expenses, and for incredibly shallow reasons.<br /><br />Now hang on a second. Don't we already know all this? The answer is yes. But Michael Moore takes everything we know and magnifies it 100x so we can view it in full spectrum. The result is clear: depression about how awful our country, the land of the free and home of the brave, is on healthcare.<br /><br />Next, Moore takes us along on journeys to Canada, the UK, France, and even Cuba to show us how amazing their healthcare is. Moore talks to the locals to find out their stories and then compares them in full force to the horrifying tales of injured and/or sick Americans who don't have--or can't reason with--health insurance.<br /><br />The painfully truthful documentary is accompanied by Moore's special, dry, tongue-in-cheek humour that we know so well from his other films. You'll be laughing at one moment, and the next moment staring in absolute sheer horror at what is being exploited right before our eyes.<br /><br />Whether you are young, old, sick, healthy, with health insurance, or without health insurance, Sicko is definitely worth the high admission prices we pay these days for the movies. See this film, in no way will you be disappointed.these days for the movies. See this film, in no way will you be disappointed.

0307237699|4.0|Towards the end of this book Barack Obama recalls a press conference he held as the newly-elected United States junior senator from Illinois in a packed basement office at the Capitol Building in Washington.    \\"It was my first day in the building; I had not taken a single vote, had not introduced a single Bill - indeed I had not even sat down at my desk when a very earnest reporter raised his hand and asked, `Senator Obama, what is your place in history?'\\"    Two-and-a-half years on and that question seems increasingly less ridiculous. Barack Obama is running for the Democratic Party's nomination for president of the United States. He is behind front-runner Hillary Clinton, but not as far behind as he once was; his campaign is gaining financial momentum; he is being described as the most inspirational American politician to emerge since Robert Kennedy and as one who remembers those fateful days in the early summer of 1968 that is a very big wrap indeed.    The speed with which this young man, the son of an American mother and a Kenyan father who has lived in Hawaii and Indonesia, has risen in both the national and increasingly international consciousness, can be demonstrated by his experience at the two Democratic Party conventions he has attended in his still relatively short political career.    In 2000 he was an unknown, unsuccessful candidate for a seat in the House of Representatives who could not even get a pass to the convention floor and was forced to watch most of the speeches on television screens. Four years later he delivered the keynote address.    The fact that at his third convention he stands a good chance of delivering an acceptance speech as the penultimate step on the road to leading the greatest power on Earth, means we should all be paying attention. Obama gained prominence in Australia when Prime Minister John Howard said the senator's policy on Iraq meant that Al Qaeda would be praying for his victory. This book is an excellent opportunity tomake a more balanced assessment.    Al Qaeda has no reason to rest easy. The senator affirms the right to take unilateral military action to eliminate an imminent threat to US security \\"if a nation, group, or individual that is actively preparing to strike US targets...has, or will have the means to do so in the immediate future. Al Qaeda qualifies under this standard\\".    However, as a general rule he believes it will always be in America's strategic interest to act multilaterally when it comes to the use of force. \\"Nobody benefits more than we do from the observance of international `rules of the road.' We can't win converts to those rules if we act as if they apply to everyone but us.     \\"When the world's sole superpower willingly restrains its power and abides by internationally agreed-upon standards of conduct, it sends a message that these rules are worth following and robs terrorists and dictators of the argument that these rules are simply tools of American imperialism.\\"    Call me a weak-kneed, liberal surrender-monkey if you like, but I can't find much wrong with that reasoning for American foreign policy initiatives in an Obama Administration.    This book was written for a purpose. Ever since his outstanding speech at the 2004 Convention - followed by his sweep into the Senate with 70 per cent of the vote against what was then a strong Republican tide - the pundits have been linking his name with a presidential bid. Since it was written Obama has declared himself a candidate and the fact it has sold more than 1.3 million copies in the US suggests it has served well as a carefully stage-managed introduction to the American people.    However, he does not shrink from addressing divisive domestic issues (gun control, the death penalty, abortion) and if at times his anecdotes verge on the syrupy, this is an essential element in winning American elections.    What emerges is an essentially fair-minded, compassionate man, disturbed by the course his nation is taking and ready to offer an alternative. In the midst of a deepening quagmire in Iraq, a drifting foreign policy in almost every other area and the Lewis `Scooter' Libby affair demonstrating that there is one law for the Bush White House and another for the rest of the nation, an alternative is clearly needed.    Is it audacious to hope in America in 2007? Barack Obama thinks not and it will be a good thing for the United States, and the world in general, if he is right.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am not, and have never been, a sci-fi fan (my favorite show is Grey's Anatomy). I finally watched this show at the urging of friends and family- I finished the DVD's within days. The show is amazing- action-packed, hilarious, suspenseful, but most of all the charatcers are the best I've ever seen in a TV show, from the first episode you fall in love with the crew and want to know what happens to them. So much so that when you're done, all that's left to do is curse Fox for cancelling the show so early and hope (unreasonably) that perhaps it will be resurrected. IT IS A MUST SEE FOR ANYONE!!!!
B00005Y7AW|5.0|Wow! What a rich experience.  Rufus Wainwright's voice is amazing.  He has a classical voice but in this popular medium he makes his vocals very accessible.  He clearly benefitted from being raised by his musical McGarrigle mother [[ASIN:B00000DCWD The McGarrigle Hour]] and also from his talented singer songwriter Wainwright father [[ASIN:B000P6R82C Strange Weirdos: Music from and Inspired by the Film Knocked Up]].     This is the best cd to start with if you are introducing yourself to Rufus Wainwright's music.  Each song has a distinctly different feel to it and uses different musical talents.  Although I think of \\"Poses\\" as his best cd, the song \\"Going to a Town\\" on his new cd \\"[[ASIN:B000O78LH8 Release the Stars]]\\" is one of the best songs of 2007, reflecting on the impressions one gets lately from spending time in America and anywhere else in the world.
B000OVLBGC|5.0|While some out there are still bitter about Pan's Labyrinth losing its thought-to-be destined Academy Award to this film, I would like to argue that The Lives of Others presents a wholly more memorable and moving experience while still adhering to a very attractive style. Writer-director Donnersmarck's cinematic debut not only pulls at our heartstrings, but he also brings us to the verge of tears without becoming overly sentimental or preachy.    Every element of this film is worthy of praise. The acting is superb. Ulrich Mühe stands out as the loyal STASI official, Wiesler, who finds himself questioning whether his duty is to the people, or to the party. The writing is wrought with beautiful moments of characterization and heartfelt but realistic dialogue. Wiesler reading poetry to himself, fantastic moments of dramatic irony, or the poet's, Georg Dreyman's, comments on his friend's gift, a piano piece entitled \\"Sonata for Good Men.\\" The direction and cinematography seem to work in tandem to provide a slow and careful look at each set and location, further describing the characters without having to muddle with exposition. The pacing is perfect. Scenes unfold and Donnersmarck takes us to the next one with seemingly no transition, but enough synergy to keep a flow going throughout. Even at two hours, the engrossing plot and splendid pacing keep you riveted.    So, The Lives of Others is, as a film, well done, all around. But why did it deserve its Oscar? Why is it not only very good, but amazing? The answer is in what its message is and how said message is presented. One might expect that even though the film has been lauded on countless occasions for its poetic beauty, cynical filmgoers might only expect the tired message that communism is bad. Of course, communist states are very much police states will be bad. Donnersmarck knows that people who watch his film will know this. What we see is unlikely protagonist, Captain Wiesler, not only loyal to the party, but to its ideals and enforcer of its laws. However, a disparity between loyalty to the state, to its people, and his loyalty to his fellow, affluent party members arises. This film does not argue against communism. It argues against overbearance by a government against its people. Wiesler's values are not shaken, but his viewpoint is broadened. In the end, it isn't about a rebel or an anarchist. This story is about someone who realized that his ideals were being twisted and decided to work towards what he thought was right.
B000OVLBEO|5.0|I'm a comics fan. I started reading comics in the 1950s.<br /><br />I wondered how they could pull off this one... The more I thought about it, the more Nicholas Cage seemed perfect for the part. (He's a comics fan.)<br /><br />I loved the story & special effects.<br /><br />This was a good portrayal of a man who finally discovered the consequences of his deal with the devil. Nicholas did a good job of a man slowly discovering his abilities, coming to terms with them, and doing his best to make his own relationship with the devil.<br /><br />It's not easy to make such a movie. You must deal with \\"old fans\\" like myself, and with new ones who are not familiar with the character.<br /><br />I loved the movie.

B000B58D1C|5.0|This thin little volume is an excellent supplement to the popular Harry Potter series. All of the magical species mentioned in the series are covered in this book, along with many more. Each animal is described physically, with notes on its temperament and magical ability. Also included are \\"Beings\\" such as Merpeople.<br /><br />The book is arranged alphabetically. Each creature is also classified by the level of danger that it brings: Expert Wizard Needed, Competent Wizard Should Cope, etc. Harry's notes, handwritten of course, pepper the pages. Example: On the page where Chaemera eggs are mentioned as being an Untradable Good, Harry notes that \\"Hagrid'll be getting some next.\\"<br /><br />All in all, a worthwhile purchase.

B000OONQBM|5.0|THE WARRIORS. Now that is one of the coolest titles ever for a film. You really don't need anymore than that. It just works.    This film tells the tale of a street gang, wrongly accused of murder, having to fight their way back to their home turf. That's the whole film. You would never think that this simple premise could fill a 97 minute movie's running time, but it does, and does so well.    I loved this film from the first time that I saw it. It was, in fact, the very first film I ever saw on VHS (waaay back when). It seem somehow fitting that I should be writing a review of the Hi-Def.    THE WARRIORS' simple plot is full of great visuals and good fight sequences, well executed (but slightly dated) synth music and a sense of fun that keeps you watching to the end.  Who could forget the freakish BASEBALL FURIES when you first see them? By the end of the film you feel every bruise, cut and scrape that they have endured through their long night, and you want the baddies to 'get theirs' totally. The actor who played the rival gang's leader (THE ROGUES) was really creepy.    If have the chance, see this film. you will not be disappointed.    Warriors....come out to play-yay, Warriors...come out to PLAY-YAY, WARRIORS.....COME OUT TO PLAY-YAY!!!!!

0553208845|5.0|I first read Siddhartha when I was nineteen years old. I became more and more enthralled as I read this book.  It opened my eyes to the idea that the spirituality of life was more important than commercialism and materialism.  I have since been on a spiritual journey which has taken me far beyond the ideas of Herman Hesse. But I will always be thankful to Hesse for giving me the \\"jump start\\" which encouraged me to look and find a perception of higher awareness.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|If it's way less than $300 for the entire series, you need to buy it.<br /><br />From 2002 to 2006, I bought each season of Friends as they were released. I just want to encourage anyone who is \\"iffy\\" or uncertain about buying this set of all ten seasons. Do it!<br /><br />Grab it while you can. This is one of those sitcoms that has such re-watchability, like Seinfeld and Frasier and The Golden Girls. I still laugh out loud at these characters and the writing.

B000PFU7OO|5.0|Let me start out by saying that the whole singer/sonwriter genre does not usually appeal to me. That being said, I found myself blown away by this film and its integral soundtrack. Having never heard the Frames (or even seen The Commitments, for that matter) this is my first exposure to Hansard's work. The music features outstanding emotional delivery and execution with lyrical content that is both poignant and catchy. Irglova's voice is unique and hauntingly beautiful. The track \\"If You Want Me\\" where she provides the lead vocals was the highlight of the album for me. Even if you don't like singer/songwriter stuff, you may enjoy this one - i did.
B0002IVN9W|4.0|Some people seem to be turned off in a big way by Win Butler's voice. Other bands around these days make me nauseous for the same reason even when their music is OK, the prime example being Modest Mouse, who I can't bloody tolerate for more than two seconds after \\"friends\\" insist on playing it. They, the Shins, and all the rest of their sorry bunch make up the new category of \\"Not-Rock\\". --Anyhow, for some reason it never occured to me that Butler's voice is in the same camp of the whiny/girly/limpwrist vocal style so sadly prevalent on the radio nowadays.    Therefore I write this simply to announce that Arcade Fire is the best band in the world right now and that's really all that needs to be said.
B000002C1W|4.0|I don't know why some people didn't like this album.  I Love it.  The Dog of War pays the whole money!!!!!!!!!
B000003493|5.0|One hit wonders?  Sure (for the most part).  Great music?  You bet!<br /><br />I have always been drawn to the music of the 1960s, particularly the late-1960s, and the three \\"Nuggets\\" CDs really whetted my appetite for more of the same.<br /><br />While The Beatles, The Doors, Jimi Hendrix, The Rolling Stones, and others ruled the charts with hit after hit, the groups featured here were majority one-hit wonders, \\"garage bands,\\" call it whatever you want, but it's those one-hit wonders that people love and fondly associate with this time period (I know I do with stuff from the 1990s, so I can relate to the nostalgic feelings from \\"dinosaurs\\" here).<br /><br />As one listens to the tracks, you can feel the youthful energy of the times, the protest against all the so-called norms, and of young people wanting to find their own way in life as opposed to having it predetermined for them.  Other songs are about drugs (oh me, oh my!) and so what?  That doesn't make them any less enjoyable.<br /><br />I listen to this CD from start to finish everytime and enjoy every song, but \\"Open My Eyes\\" by The Nazz and \\"Journey to the Center of the Mind\\" by The Amboy Dukes are two great tunes that keep me jamming.  I find that the more I listen to it, the more I appreciate some tunes I didn't pay enough attention to the first six hundred times around.<br /><br />It's wise to buy all three \\"Nuggets\\" CDs as opposed to buying just the compilation.  You'd be cheating yourself out of some great music if you did.  - Donna Di Giacomo
B000001EXR|5.0|This album is an underated gem. It captures a different side of Kiss that has never been captured before, dark and gritty. I wish they would've continued this course. A lot of the songs on tis album put me in the mindset of Alice In Chains or Sound Garden, which Kiss pulled off this much better in my opinon. If you like Kiss dark and heavy then go ahead and indulge in this treat
B000MGUZM0|4.0|Lots of fans seem to think that Neon Bible is a letdown from Funeral. I disagree. Neon Bible is just as terrific, if not moreso. Of course Funeral was more upbeat but Neon Bible is, for all its gloominess, just as exhilarating, -- inspiring, -- magnificent, -- O yes and damn hard not to dance along with! And who would have thought that Win Butler & co. were listening so much to The Boss?     Arcade Fire puts everyone else out there (in the contemporary pop/rock/etc. arena) to shame. What is Arcade Fire to me? Arcade Fire for me is the sole reason that I believe that good music is finally BACK. Lord knows the radio has been nothing but pure sniveling cripe (Modest Mouse, Shins, etc. etc.) for too long.      Why the four stars? I don't like the new version of \\"No Cars Go\\" too much. I also don't like any album having 11 songs of standard length. 47 minutes? Campaign for a double album anyone? Also, reviewers on Amazon toss 5 stars at just about anything.  --But don't get me wrong. This record is the business.
B000002B35|4.0|Finally I decided to bought this cd.  First to say I had listened it a time ago and didn't care about it.  So I decided to give a second chance. (Ten years after!!!) I must to say I love it!!!!!!!!.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|It took me a while to actually sit down and watch CASINO ROYALE, but I finally got the chance to see it.  Now, I wish I would have saw it in the movie theater and I would have gotten a better effect.  This one, I would have to say ranks up there as one of the best BOND films.  Just love OCTOPUSSY and THE SPY WHO LOVED ME.      Daniel Craig shines as the new 007.  He's edgier and charasmatic.  This Bond is pretty good.  After hearing that he will be in the upcoming new BOND film (that will be directed by Marc Forster), I think it's safe to say that people are going to slowly embrace Daniel as the new Bond and CASINO was a great jumping off point.  He carries this film with ease and it's fun everytime that he is on the screen.    My only trouble with this film was the female lead, Vesper Lynd (played by Eva Green).  She's beautiful and all, but I felt that she wasn't a strong choice as a Bond heroine and not to mention there's another female character that looks just like her in this film and there was no uniqueness about each woman.  The acting was one dimensional for me.  But, then again, this is mostly an action film and he delivered on the action.  It is definitely an edge of your seat type thriller.      Overall, this film is great - there are some parts of it storyline wise that I wish were stronger, but it still delivers on all levels.
B000002H33|5.0|This is one of Metallica best albums ever, I remember buying this album when I was 12 back in '86, I was hooked on Metallica ever since then. The title track is a true classic, but the instrumental \\"Orion\\" has been and always will be my favorite  song on the album. Great guitar work and melodies make this album pure gold. I hope the next Metallica album can recapture the old school sound, buy this album I highly recommend it!!!
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a wonderful writer as anyone who has read the Kite Runner would know.  One would also know how powerful his books are and how relevent they are to current world affairs.  Hosseini character development is excellent and the story he weaves makes one care deeply about the people and situation in Ahganistan.

0061122416|5.0|This book ranks among the more memorable along with Siddhartha, The Way of the Peaceful Warrior and Jonathan Livingston Seagull. a thought provoking read that makes one smile and shake your head comparing the story with ones own life! As with the great books, the end being very similar... it's not about what you find at the end of the journey... it's the journey itself...I bought a copy on line from Amazon, because I live in Prague, Czech Republic and had it sent to my Dad in FLA...he never reads... he glanced at it, then got sucked right into the story, finishing it extremely fast...afterwards we talked about the story...also a new enlightening event for us... he now has read most of the books I have and is still going...thanks Paulo
B00005KHEU|4.0|This is a terrific follow up to the amazing 1978 double disc \\"Out Of The Blue\\".  It has been said that this collection is on the \\"Disco-very\\" side.  I disagree.  That being said, I admit there are some dancey numbers included, but most of all the music is delicious.  By that I mean it is indulgent and very recreational.  Nothing too serious to weigh it down it is magical thinking at it's best.  The first track \\"Shine A Little Love\\" has a seamless rythm and ultra catchy chorus.  Next up, \\"Confusion\\". Interestingly kooky.  \\"Need Her Love\\" is light and slightly moody.  I never understood the next song, \\"Diary of Horace Wimp\\" and I actually despised it growing up.  Finally, many years later, I get it.  I have read that if the Beatles were to have continued, this would be their 'sound'.  ?  Other tracks include the riveting \\"Last Train To London\\", the Beach Boyesque \\"On The Run\\", \\"Wishing\\" and finally the over hyped \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\".<br />All of the songs on Discovery are wonderful to hear-especially through a headset as their are many ingredients in this soundscape.
B000BKVQTS|2.0|Sure, I had read the reviews when this film was released, but who can trust the critics these days? I figured that if Terry Gilliam directed it, it must have something going for it. How wrong I was. Aside from some very nice cinematography and special effects, there is little to recommend here.     The problems begin with the premise itself: Jacob and Wilhelm Grimm are charlatan \\"exorcists\\" traveling about Germany and collecting local folk legends in order to dupe the locals into hiring them to rid their towns and forests of various supernatural specters, actually created by the brothers themselves. Not only is the viewer immediately reminded of \\"Ghostbusters\\" (a far superior film), but he must certainly be asking himself why on earth did the film makers choose to present the protagonists as two loathsome con-men instead of simple wandering storytellers/actors. The con-man angle really adds nothing to the plot.    The next thing I found irritating was that most of the actors were speaking with a British accent. None of the characters are British, as the story takes place in French occupied Germany. The French Soldiers all speak with heavy French accents and one character, apparently intended as comic relief, is Italian. So why British accents for all the German characters?    Another irritation is that the various fairy tale characters and events are jumbled together somewhat haphazardly and out of context with the original stories. I guess the film makers were thereby implying that the brothers were later to write individual fairy tales based upon each of the characters they encountered in their \\"real life\\" adventure. Not a bad idea, but poorly handled, with some characters being two or more fairy tale characters in one: Red Riding Hood's woodsman is also the Big Bad Werewolf, as well as Sleeping Beauty's father; Sleeping Beauty's Wicked Witch is also Rapunzel; etc. Putting characters from various Grimm fairy tales into one story is one thing, morphing them into one character is another. If you want fairy tale creatures out of their original context, I suggest watching any of the Shrek movies.    Maybe the biggest obstacle to enjoying this film is that none of the characters is particularly likable, not even the brothers themselves. Sure, there have been movies made about likable con-men, but they usually center around revenge plots against some scurrilous villain. In this film, the two con-men brothers prey upon poor superstitious villagers, not wealthy landholders or other stock \\"villains\\". What's to like about that? The mortal villain of this film (as opposed to the supernatural villains) is played by Jonathan Pryce, in a role highly reminiscent of his character in \\"The Adventures of Baron Munchausen\\". Pryce is good, but this is getting to be a stock character in Gilliam's films.    My final criticism is that the film simply went on too long. I found myself wishing it would just end, but every time I thought it was about to end it kept going on. And to top it off, after Sleeping Beauty is awakened by Heath Ledger's kiss of \\"true love\\", she's rolling in the hay with Matt Damon not 30 seconds later! Well, at least Heath didn't kiss Matt and whatever threesome may have transpired later was not shown on screen.    I can only recommend this film to those who love special effects and mindless action without regard to coherent storytelling.
067003830X|5.0|What a great book!<br /><br />In this insightful book, Norman Doidge explores the amazing concept of neuroplasticity.  In other words,  how chemistry changes behaviour and how behaviour, also, alters chemistry.<br /><br />Through simplified personal examples and clear language he makes it easy, while still fascinating, for the everyday \\"layman\\" to understand and follow this interesting concept of neuroscience.<br /><br />A must read!!!
B00007KQA3|4.0|Like most reviewers, I read Orwell's novel long before I watched this film, and I think this is the crucial point.  This is a film that clearly stands on the shoulders of the book, a film that lends visual authority and power, really, to many of the themes (and overall mood) developed in the book.  If you watch this movie without first making any headway against the novel, I am afraid you will walk away with the impression that you have just watched a rather peculiar, (but on the whole) rather forgettable film about a time-worn man searching for a way out of an absolutely pulverizing totalitarian state.  But if you watch this movie with the cheater's advantage of knowing what to look for, then the film, in my opinion, rates much better, because then you will be able to use it to sharpen and refine your appreciation of certain Orwellian themes.    What stands out about this film?  To start, I was mesmerized by the film's masterful rendering of the tone and appearance of a totalitarian state.  The air is cold and caustic, the buildings gray, cracked, and obliterated, the entire scene a rubble, like a society that awakens one day to nuclear fall-out.  The only signs of human life in this smashed landscape are the ever-present telescreens that dispense state news alerts or triumphant reports of production goals for raw materials being met.  Main character Winston Smith reflects the wider, societal degradation and decay in his deeply-lined face and burned out gaze, a twiggish man who coughs and hacks his way through daily, state-mandated calisthenics.  In short, the visual aspect of the film was, to me, the obvious highlight.    Second, I think that, thematically, the film is rich and provoking.  As with any film adaptation of a classic novel, the film has to condense its menu of ideas and its analysis of those ideas, and it is for this reason that people often mistakenly criticize a film for falling short of the book's grandeur.  But the filmmakers here raise a bundle of interesting questions, and certainly they raise the questions that deserved to be raised.  The film asks us to ponder 'By what means and measures does the state maintain its crushing grip on power?'  'How are people and society warped, physically and psychologically, when denied the power to choose?' 'How is the effort to preserve one's language and history relevant to the effort to sustain freedom and opportunity?'  'Are there any fissures in the edifice of the state, or any escape routes that provide hope for a different future?'  'Could this happen anywhere today?'  Etc.    In the end, the film provides suitable depth for most of these themes but falters with others.  Terrifyingly, the film suggests no route of escape for Winston Smith, nor anyone else.  The school-age children are indoctrinated with the lies and false logic of the state, and their youthful, bouyant loyalty surpasses even that of their parents, some of whom seem to sense somewhere in the farthest recesses of their minds that they've been made to worship a false idol, though they will never admit it.  And for those like Winston Smith, who suspect just this, the state employs ruthless techniques of coercion and re-conditioning.    One final note.  I've read many reviews of the novel and of the film, and for some reason, many people feel compelled to discern striking similarities between what Orwell wrote and what the world looks like today.  \\"Look at what's happening in the US right now,\\" they'll say, or \\"This stuff is already happening\\" etc.  Nonsense.  Orwell's warnings demand our attention, sure, but I notice today that in the good old USA, I got up at a time of my choosing, ate what I wanted for breakfast, decided not to run in a local 5k race, booted up my computer instead, checked a baseball box score, then typed a review of a film about autocratic rule.  Thanks, Big Brother!
