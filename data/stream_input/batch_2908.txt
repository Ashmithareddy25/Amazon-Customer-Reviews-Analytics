B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Loved this product, it was cheap, high quality, and very comfortable. I found myself playing around with the mouse for hours more than my other mouse and the sensitivity button it extremely helpful, because switching the sensitivity for different games was a pain because I would have to go to settings and do it, I would highly recommend this product.
B003DZX44I|5.0|As my wife's all time favorite Disney movie I've been counting down to the Blu-Ray release of this film, and this does not disappoint. As the first ever animated film to be nominated for Best Picture, the movie itself doesn't really need me to say how great it is. This disc is top notch, with a truly amazing look at the making of the film. This includes some very indepth material on what the film almost was before it was decided to make it a musical, including storyboards. It's a fascinating look into the process of creating a masterpiece. All of the special features are well produced and well chosen. A must have for young viewers or adult fans.
B005S9ELY4|4.0|great movie, even though its not original very entertaining especially in crystal clear blu ray format. but does not include the original theater shooting scene in the that they cut out of the original film because of the aurora shooting in the deleted scenes section =/
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I have been on an \\"end of the world\\" kick lately and was totally caught by surprise with this take on it. I was spellbound from page one. Fast paced and never wanted to put it down. Love that the \\"hero\\" is actually a heroin!
B006ZWLXZ8|5.0|great album by a bad ass singer.  Vinyl version is nice and  looks cool ass hell. Recommend it if you like Lana Del Rey and vinyl
B005HV6Y84|5.0|Soundtracks are my favorite, I can just listen as I work or drive, but picture the movie/book in my head as it plays.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Great book, my son really enjoyed it. He has read other books in this series and liked this one the best. I would highly recommend it to anyone with kids.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Used this app for about a year and it is very useful, giving times for all sorts of functions on my kindle fire HD
B00DJWV11I|5.0|I have to say this book was one of the most entertaining books I have read in years, maybe ever.  I absolutely loved its whit and charm.  I laughed out loud several times and truly enjoyed getting into the male brain! :-)  I loved being a part of this story and couldn't wait to get back to it each night to read more. Emma is a genius writer, I will be looking for more of her books to enjoy!<br /><br />What a great read, I'm sad it is over!
1439152810|1.0|I have read some wonderful Kate Morton books- The Forgotten Garden being my favorite.  This is my least favorite.<br /><br />The story itself is not interesting, and the text is verbose and flowery, I felt it was padded.  Oh the excitement of a discovery- mid conversation, we switch to how someone feels, some more history and then back to the conversation and discovery.  This book was maddening. Endless minueta, repetitive descriptions.<br /><br />Potential Spoilers:<br /><br />The characters were unlikeable... especially Dolly.<br /><br />Dolly- Who could like someone that seems to have two personalities, vain, and potentially bi-polar?<br />Jimmy who was extraordinarily nice and blind to realities<br />Vivian who was no voice until towards the end of the book, and then is the victim.<br />Laurel-  Wishy washy character<br />Flower Sisters- extraneous and unlikeable<br />Gerry-  If we have to hear how smart his is, brilliant and irresponsible again.... and again.<br /><br />The whole beginning of the book, the details of Dolly's life, really just did not belong in this book.  It was a sidewinder and it took up most of the beginning of the book.<br /><br />The ending - with the flip flopping between years- I generally like, in this book it was used as a way to thicken the book.  Why did she finally roll Gerry into it, so she could receive a phone call from him on a payphone, but wait, its a payphone, and Gerry can't tell her all that he found out because he has not enough coins on him.  CLICK-  So that discovery will come up later, with lots of language about Gerry and him being so brilliant but irresponsible.<br /><br />This book was a disappointment, although I will definitely read the last Kate Morton book, so I can say I've read them all.  I am holding out hope for it.
B00DBSZJRM|1.0|I just watch the first ten minutes of the movie, if that much.  I wish I could have gotten my money back.
B0089MXRII|5.0|Twelve Months of a Soviet Childhood is a charming collection of twelve short stories, one for each month of the year, completing a cycle of time that harkens back to the author's childhood in her homeland, and to her rich Russian culture. To enrich our experience and make it even more vivid, the author, Julia Gousseva, offers not only the stories but in parallel also the reference material for them.<br /><br />For example, she precedes the story 'January: A New Year's Party at the Kremlin' with tidbits of historical notes about the Czatina Alexandra Fyodorovna, who brought the idea of decorating a pine tree from Germany. From this the author pivots right into the story as seen from her eyes as a young child. The dialog with her older cousin Dmitry is quite telling about the regime at the time: &#34;There are hidden cameras behind that mirror,&#34; he whispers, &#34;to watch for stuff. And I don't like when people watch me. Or control me. &#34;I like to be independent.&#34;<br /><br />Each one of these childhood memories is told in a refreshingly honest manner, and you can get a feel for the Russian soul simply by the temperature and locale of these vignettes: &#34;February: Sunshine above the Clouds,&#34; &#34;March: Meeting My Best Friend,&#34; &#34;April: Swimming in Gorky Park,&#34;May: The Swamp Spirit,&#34; &#34;June: A Real Gentleman,&#34; &#34;July: The Hedgehog,&#34; &#34;August: The Music Box,&#34; &#34;September: The First Day of School,&#34; &#34;October: The Witch Club,&#34; &#34;November: House Repairs,&#34; and &#34;December: New Year's Tree,&#34; which brings us full circle to the beginning of the year. To offer any more than these titles would be robbing you of the delightful experience and of the Russian soul, which is celebrated in this book. I highly recommend it.<br /><br />Five stars.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Sounds a lot like Dylan, but this man had great insight into his world.  Great listening and watching the move about him was really interesting.

140006922X|4.0|Zealot digs deep. The first half of the book is focused almost entirely on the socio/political climate during which Jesus lived and very little about the man himself. This is important because it really gives a clear idea of the hierarchy of power and how cheap life was for those at the bottom of the totem pol during such turbulent times. The latter half puts Jesus into this context based on historical evidence. Instead of repeating much of the other reviews I will point out interesting things I did not realize beforehand.<br /><br />Pontious Pilate's role in Jesus death was likely not nearly as hands on as the gospels indicate. Jesus was hardly the only person claiming to be messiah and crucified for sedition. It would have been surprising for Jesus to have been in the presence of Pilate at all. Given how Pilate had a formal complaint lodged against him for sending Jews to death without trial by Jerusalem, It's more likely Jesus would be a name checked off on a list. The idea of Pilate being reluctant to crucify Jesus and putting the choice in the hands of the Jews is an anti-Semitic version of events from the author's imagination meant to quell tension with Rome and vilify Jews shortly after the great revolt.<br /><br />Nobody really disputed Jesus' ability to cast miracles and heal the sick. Though it is interesting that other people who did the same during his time tended to be labeled as performing \\"magic\\". While there was an intentional effort to avoid using that terminology with Jesus in an effort to promote his divinity. It's also interesting that Jesus was reluctant to heal gentiles. The book itself argues a strong case for Jesus' exclusivity towards Jews and Israel alone. As illustrated by Matthew 15:24 \\"Then Jesus said to the woman, \\"I was sent only to help God's lost sheep--the people of Israel.\\"<br /><br />While Paul's gospel was not the first to recognize Jesus' divinity, Jesus himself used the terminology \\"Son of man\\" vs \\"Son of God\\". Whether this wasto avoid attracting Roman attention or because he truly did not see himself as divine is difficult to know for certain. Only Paul's gospel written after Jesus' death really emphasized the divine aspects and shaped the way Christianity is seen today. I find this ironic as Jesus and Paul never actually met each other. Thus his message already appears to be manipulated not long after his death. Even reading about how Paul was treated by the elders for spreading a new message of Jesus the Christ is contradictory. I wished Aslan had spent more time delving into Rome's adopting of Christianity through Constantine. I see that being a pivotal moment where a much larger group of people began to take on the religion as their own. I suspect Jesus' message becomes even more blurred from his original intent and motivations at this point.<br /><br />While so many questions still remain unanswered, this is still a great book. If one is to truly want to understand his real message, I would highly suggest this as your starting point.<br /><br />One thing that baffles me are the one star reviews from people who have clearly not read the book. This is a huge concern in any context. Attempting to have an opinion on something you've not taken the time to educate yourself about is the most blatant form of ignorance I can think of. Ignorance that seems to run deep through the general American collective.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|I started watching this movie and instantly I thought I wasn't going to be able to make it through to it's end. Much to my surprise I actually saw the ending.
B007IXWKUK|2.0|The idea behind 50 shades is brilliant. The writing is awful. So much repetitiveness and dull moments. I'm sad to admit that I am dissapointed.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|From start to finish, this CD is strong. Boz puts his &#34;touch&#34; on each song. A must have for any Boz Scaggs fan. My favorite next to Other Roads.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|Not at all what I was expecting.  A great read with excellent insight into the world of a drug addict in denial.  Told with humour and honesty.
B0055G9L9U|5.0|I first saw this movie when I rented it on iTunes, but, later, when I wanted to buy it, it was'nt available thru iTunes. But, thru the app.&#34;Amazon instant video&#34;, I can watch it anytime I want on my iPad.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|I got this for my daughter's kindle and tested it on my phone first. After playing with it for a couple of minutes I knew she would love it. She goes and snuggles up on the couch or bed for at least an hour sometimes and all I hear is giggling and laughing. She found out that when taking a photo, if you wait until they start to smile, you can get some pretty cliche school photo type shots.<br />I would suggest more accessories, and maybe be able to rotate them as well? And of course, I hope we see more characters with a future update. (Did I mention that I love their goofiness?)<br />Also, I'm not going to deduct a star for this, but the S-pen on my Note 2 didn't work with this app. This it's the ONLY app it doesn't work with. I didn't even think that was possible. So maybe we can see that fixed in the future as well.
B005H9B2CE|3.0|the movie isn't as action packed and exciting as i thought it would be. The love story between thor and the scientist is not very compelling.
B000J5XS3C|4.0|I bought this mixer to use on a podcast and while it works great, there is a slight hum when I plug my computer's headphone jack into the  RCA input on the board using an adapter.  It's actually not in the recording, but I hear it in my headset. I'm still testing different configurations so there may be a way to change the input to another channel and get rid of the hum, otherwise it works fine.  I'm not a fan of the plug as others have noted, and there's no off/on switch but for the money, I think it's going to work fine for me.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|WOW...something different, catchy, and addictive. I could throw out a few bands and say they are a combo of those, and if i did they would be world class bands.<br />Go to utube, listen to the cheesy low resolution versions, and if you like what you hear, buy the album/CD. The actual CD is a different animal from the web resources. It has crazy mid range, and I think its used artistically. For those battling the volume wars, this is a loud album. I would like to have it toned down some, for quality playback concerns. But, the material over shadows this concern.<br />The videos for the songs are amazing, and a little strange. Again, they are on utube.<br />Hiden track, if you play out the last song past 11 minutes or so.<br /><br />RECOMMENDED RELEASE
B002QYSZBO|5.0|This is one of my favorite Robert Downey, Jr. movies.  I had this movie saved on my DVR until I bought it.  Even though I had it on my DVR, I still watched it when it was on TV.
B005I64U5C|4.0|Ahhhh, Green Lantern. You have been ripped apart by fan boys and backed by the nerds. This is a movie that you usually stand to either love or hate. The regular release I saw in the theater and owned on DVD to be played when doing stuff around the house, to have on in the background, and never really thought bad of it, but never stood up to the recent quality of superhero movies that have been washing ashore, although it is leaps and bounds ahead of those that came before. (Lookin at you Punisher: War Zone) Renolds, and all of the cast really, do a great job bringing the roles to life, some even offer quite poignant pefromances. The CGI is mostly well done, and nothing really seems to cut the movie down per se, but the somewhat flat plot and overall &#34;non climax&#34; feeling, just give it that, &#34;It was OK.&#34; I would give the base film a 3 star rating, but for the 3D version, I am bumping it a star up as it really was well done. It added enough to make me WANT to watch, brought life to some scenes that were otherwise unflattering, and makes an improvement to the overall experience, and that is what 3D should do. Love it or hate it, for the price and value you get, I would still give this one a shot.
B0063IH60K|5.0|As near to the real thing as possible.  Graphics are top notch.  I would and have recommended it to several other people.
B001TH16DI|5.0|A nice set with all the Original Series films. The packaging is sleek and attractive, you know all about the movies themselves, so lets not kid ourselves, if you do not own these already, pick this up. If buying this and the Next Gen set seperate, it is still less cost than purchasing the Stardate Collection, and the packaging and access to the discs is much better, so choose what is best for you!
006091307X|2.0|This is one of those books that you read, then wonder what the hell all the talk is about. Perhaps footnotes would be good. It's more than just dated, it's just not that good. Okay there is some good prose here. But that makes this whole novel that much less excusable. He has the talent to write something beautiful and chooses this? Sure there's a conspiracy, there are some funny moments, but that does not make a classic.<br />I'll try Gravity's Rainbow and see if that's any better.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|The cast from the first film return for the all new adventure of the starship Enterprise. Being the next reboot of the series on events from the first films, this one will strike the hearts or hatred of Trekkies with its retelling of ***SPOLIER***  The Wrath of Khan. Personally, I thought they did a fantastic job turning Sherlock's Benedict Cumberbatch into the representation of Khan as a more sane, plotting, and devious enemy over the somewhat meddened version from the original film. The casting remains excellent with all the key roles filled by ample talent and good performances, Quinto does a better performance as Spock, letting his more human side show both through attitude and action, letting us see an improvement to his character through more freedom in not being tied to the original Spocks emotional restrictions. Karl, Simon, Chris, and crew all do well, and the only issue with casting I have, is in Alive Eves role as the admirals daughter. First off, she is absolutely gorgeous. She also is an accomplished and skilled actress. However, her addition to the film struck me as uneeded. It felt she was placed here to eek by in an underlying role with just enough ties to the plot to make her relevant long enough to get a &#34;for no reason&#34; underwear shot.<br /><br />As a red blooded male, it was... well fantastic, but for the film, seemed like a juvenile attempt at pulling the Geek and Gamers to the film by being able to use it in the preview and using her to sell extra tickets. Everything she did in the film, every relation she had in it, could have been removed completely, or replaced by existing cast, and it in no way would have impacted the film. For the Record, THIS IS A STAR TREK MOVIE, you had every self respecting nerd, geek, gamer, trekkie, and Sci-Fi fan preordering tickets before the first teaser finished playing. Do not insult us by thinking we need the blond bomshell in a skirt to compete the film experience. I found it rather distastefull of the franchise, and insulting to Ms. Eve, and hindering to the movie. I in no way dock the film for it, as it is not like I will not enjoy her scenes, just did not appreciate the lowbrow approach to her characters inclusion into the series.<br /><br />Other than that small huge rant, I felt just about everything was improved over the first installment. Experiencing it in 3D boosts the enjoyment to new heights, and there is no shortage of CGI Eye Candy, the look at the rebooted Klingon was well done, with a happy medium between the original envisionment of them (if you do not know, go look that up lol) and the &#34;classic&#34; look most are used to. The characters meld and bounce off each other much smoother and the time they spent together through the first tale has really bonded them better both in dialogue and action, making a smoother film, with each being able to bring out more of the nuances of each individual. Things that friends do with each other that creates the familiarity with the characters and invests you more in the film.<br /><br />I have no qualms about recommending the new reboot films to anyone, and see them only growing better in time. I would love however, to see them allow a new non-rebooted tale for the cast to stretch out with and make their own marks on the franchise instead of restricting them to follow in very big footsteps. Good Film, Worth the Money, Make it So!franchise, and insulting to Ms. Eve, and hindering to the movie.

0763644765|5.0|The book gets the point across well to my 1 and 2 year old. They love to celebrate after the baby finally goes potty, and it is getting them more interested in the potty waiting for them in the bathroom. The potty book is not pushy, it just peaks their interest.

B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|I love these stories. I could read them all day. I've read and loved many folk tales over the years but I've never come across African folk tales before. They remind me of parables from the Bible but they are more quaint reasons for why something is like it is rather than a moral message.<br /><br />They will be great little tales to read to the kids at bed-time. I'll certainly be watching out for books in the future. Such a refreshing change from other children's books
B00AHQNHSY|2.0|It won't play the video files it says it will on Kindle HD.  I had to convert my files to MP4s.  It does allow me to organize my videos in folders which is why I didn't rate it even lower.

I've colour coordinated day/week/month/task/ event columns, so it's easy to see at a glance where you are, what you need to do, and what happens next.<br /><br />Definitely worth trying out.

B00DQVSTCG|3.0|I love Madonna, but holy mother which high school AV club did she hire to edit this DVD?  This is the worst editing job ever!  There are parts where the video and audio are not synchronized.  You can tell that her lips are singing something else while the audio is 3 seconds behind.<br /><br />With 11 cameras filming this performance, you would imagined that the high school AV club that worked on the editing had ample footage to put together a decent DVD.  However, the picture quality is horrible; because it was filmed in digital.  First time that this is done for any Madonna tour.  You can tell that the image quality is lacking and not near Blue Ray.  But in the span of 5 seconds the high school AV club that edited this will show you six different camera angles.  So you get a really annoying constant flash of images that make no sense and completely destroy her performance.  At times, you see more audience and more dances than Madonna.<br /><br />At the start of just about every song, when Madonna should be on your screen, the high school AV club that edited this shows you the audience or some crazy faced backup dancer spazing out on stage.  Just take a look at Vogue.  When she comes out, the high school AV club that edited this shows you something else...over and over...but barely any Madonna.<br /><br />I do like that she chose to use the audio track feeding from her microphone.  So you actually get to hear her and not some auto-tune box.  Without a doubt her performance is beyond phenomenal and no one comes close.  But the editing is so horrible...so painfully horrible.  Which is sad considering that this is the last tour that we will ever see.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Collecting all the seasons!  Shockingly outrageous biker series- not for the easily offended or faint of heart!  They continue to surprise and shock.
0679437223|5.0|Read this book in high school, now 20+ years later I'm reading it because I want to.  Now that I've got a little more life experience under my belt, I understand the book.  Loved the sarcasm, irony, and twisted humor of this book.  Entertaining and thought provoking read.
B000QRIGLC|4.0|incredible story written by Marcus Luttrell. It is absolutely incredible what he went through and it made for a gripping read.
B00DB624GS|5.0|This is the Fleetwood Mac that endures.  If you don't have this version, it's a must buy as it includes the missing songs from the original sessions and is sequenced as originally intended.  One of the best blues albums ever!
B0002KPIQY|1.0|I know the movie is terrific but the product I bought was not as good as described. First of all dvd disk was used, and despite of that was not working properly and it is freezed several times during operation. I don't believe that the product like this(most likely inoperative) released from Amazon.com. Thanks,<br /><br />Sincerely,<br />Abdullah Olomi
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|the rich history of star trek means there is a treasure trove of references to the original series, but, even if you have never seen any of the TV show, this movie stands alone as great sci-fi adventure. the villian is rich with depth, well acted by cumberbatch. the extravagant sets lend themselves well to 3D with out distracting from the story. its actually quite beautiful. i highly recommend this film.
B0088W2QCM|3.0|I love this series, although It's not nearly as good as the original Sg-1. Perhaps it's just nostalgia that makes me say this, but I felt a much greater sense of exploration and discovery in the original as well as more comedic moments.<br /><br />Like several shows I've tried to watch streaming on Amazon prime, the closed caption subtitles are sometimes (recently on episode 7) off. I don't mean they are out of sync but that they apparently belong to a completely separate show. This is extremely irritating because I often like to watch shows with a friend who is deaf.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I prefer the old version of your app.  It was easier to read and more informative up front.  For instance, the maps were easier to navigate and more on point, than the new format.  Am so disappointed with the changes, that I will be uninstalling the app.
B003TTNYF2|1.0|When this series originally was on television, I was in a time of life where I just did not have time to watch these shows. Now in retirement have time to find out what all of the fuss was about.  And am puzzled.  Grey's Anatomy, is it about a hospital or a highschool? Being old and having a lot of experience in these matters, I must say that this series is a serious slap in the face to all of the people in the medical profession. I realize the paycheck is important, but a lot of the main characters must have had a hard time to keep from gagging when asked to say some of their lines. Have called a halt in the middle of the 6th installment as just cannot take any more creepiness.  So much disrespect for the people saving lives every day. Am glad I did check it out though, as it has made me better informed about the entertainment media and what they are up to. Which ultimately is the crushing of our country and way of life.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|This book was incredible! I had no idea what to expect, but let's just say that this was everything I didn't expect. It almost seemed like three seperate books.

B00EVCD9HY|5.0|OHHHH YEAHHH!! I've been waiting for her cd to come out since the first time I heard Q.U.E.E.N. I love Janelle Monae's style both fashion and music. I bought this cd at 1:40 this morning, started listening to it at 6:00 am and continued to play it throughout the day. Thank goodness I can listen to music at work lol.<br /><br />Currently, the song that I am jamming to for sure is Electric Lady with Solange..This song gets me moving just like Q.U.E.E.N does. Primetime with Miguel..It's Code...Ghetto Woman..I absolutely love love love the rap verse OMG!Can't live without your Love..I love Dorothy Dandridge Eyes with Ms Esperanza Spalding...What an Experience... I can not forget about Give Em What They Love with the legendary Prince.<br /><br />This music isn't for twerking and any other ratchetness. It's written so lovely and the sound itself is awesome. It has a nice 70/80s groove. I don't know what else to say is that it's the BOMB.com. I haven't given anyone 5 stars since SWV's latest cd. If you enjoy good good real R&B, you will definitely enjoy this.

B004X80QNG|4.0|I've been trying to find a replacement for Astrid (RIP) and I had yet to find a calendar or contacts app I really liked. Now I have all 3, in one app.<br /><br />I haven't had any issues at all with PI and my Kindle Fire HD, the interface looks fine and there have been no crashes or glitches. The calendar gives me an option for scheduling things on, say, the 2nd Sunday of every month or every other week, which was big for me - everything else I tried had one or neither option. It's not too hard to find your way around.<br /><br />The only drawbacks I've seen (and maybe I just can't find it) are an inability to edit/delete templates after they've been created, and I can't seem to group my contacts. But I can live with this. Nice app.
B006X08FDA|5.0|Great album!  Love every song!  Amazingly diverse group with attention given to all participants.  Can't wait to see them again.
B009WUAK2M|3.0|If you want to watch a no-brainer movie with oldtimer actors fighting together to right the wrongs of the world, it's fine.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|Wanted to see this in the theaters but missed it.  Only bought the Blu-ray because we have our own theater now.  Otherwise, I probably would have stuck with just DVD.  Also, it wasn't much more than the Blu-ray by itself.  As a bonus, the price went down from the time I pre-ordered it, and got some money back.  Anyways, back to the movie.  The quality is good.  The CGI is very transparent with the only borderline effects being those scenes with the water reactors in them.  The film is cut together well with the story flowing pretty seamlessly.  Overall, a well executed production with good acting.
B00DQAM5LI|5.0|I don't think it would be going out on a limb to say that Avenged set out to pay homage to some of the greatest metal bands with Hail to the King.  Amazing musicianship as always, and the new drummer is a great fit.  We all know that Avenged doesn't need to rip off anyone, so it's obviously intentional, and it works!<br /><br />\\"Doing Time\\" sounds so much like a Appetite era Guns N Roses song that I actually checked to see if it was a B-side that I wasn't aware of!<br /><br />\\"This Means War\\" could have been on Metallica's Black Album.<br /><br />\\"Coming Home\\" could be on any number of Iron Maiden records, including twin guitar leads and harmonies.<br /><br />And there's no denying the similarity to the very Angus Young lead from AC/DC's \\"Thunderstruck\\" that runs the length of Hail to the King.<br /><br />There are other similarities to some of the greats from the 80's and on as well, but those are the real standouts.<br /><br />This is SO WORTH THE MONEY!  Go out and buy it!
B00AZMFK3K|3.0|Expected 3 discs, but expected to download the digital copy, which did not work despite following flyer included. I think its false advertising!
B009HUB40Y|3.0|The game itself was ok but Lookout Security warned me it was adware and I was forced to delete it from my Kindle HD.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Just so much fun!!! I am always waiting to see what happens next. I just it doesn't freeze so often.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved all the books.  I believe this one was the best. I highly recommend it and hope there are more to come.
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|I own other seasons and added this to my collection.  I love the series and will get the other sets.
B00B7VZN76|2.0|Please note that these are not widescreen and certainly not 1.85:1. While the video and audio quality are greatly improved compared to the DVDs, the aspect ratio is still 1.33:1. I thought that I had read a year or so ago that they would be 1.67:1, but that turns out to be not correct.
6305511055|4.0|Good movie, but no big deal. The acting is good, the story just OK. I was expecting a better story line, but I was disappointed.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Now you See Me is a movie about a FBI agent and an Interpol detective who attempt to track a team of illusionists who pull off bank heists during their performances and reward their audiences with the money.<br /><br />The movie does a decent job at leaving you in the dark for most of the movie as to the purpose of why these 4 magicians are doing what they are doing throughout the movie. This movie is a kind of \\"The Prestige\\" meets \\"Ocean 11\\" combination with some elements from both.  The elements of each for the most part works well.<br /><br />The action and a strong soundtrack keeps this movie paced well and keeps you interested throughout.  Although the finale does end in a predictable and at least to me not so surprising way but never the less I enjoyed the movie and thought it was a bit different than the norm. It's a worthwhile rent.
B0053KWDES|5.0|for 50 bucks there is no other. i bought this to power my DT 990 PRO 250OHMS,  first when i had that headphone my laptop wouldnt power it because the jack doesnt provide enough  this amp does the job right perfect. the dial is awsome and the 2 mode bass boost is nice. it also has a treble button where it turns it high or low. this thing comes with the BAND for putting the ipod or phone with the amp, a aux cable, and a use charging cable. also come in a nice metal case. for the price it cant be beats.. sounds really nice and goes well with ur headphones  go for it
B004DLPXAO|2.0|The app is ok for reading on most laptops.  I give it two stars because my experience with it has been on my Ubuntu laptop.  Yes, I know I could just dual boot into Windows, but that's a pain.  I also don't want to deal with the drag on my system of using VMware. If they can get it to work on Android it's not that much trouble to at least get it running on Ubuntu.  However, I have managed to get it working on Wine and it works reasonably well.  It actually behaves a little better there than it does on my wife's netbook running Windows 7 Starter edition.  Of course the main problem there is probably Windows 7 running on an underpowered processor (as is the case with most netbooks), but it does freeze if there's much else running at the same time.
B0058SNKNS|5.0|Comfortable. But these run a little big. 7 is too small. 8 slightly too big. Shoes sometimes make sucking noises as I walk. (I say they have a flatulence issue).  BUT I love them!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Excellent read with great characters, she ties them all together. Could not put it down. Very real and good flow.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I felt the book was disjointed with no real connection between the caracters.  It lacked the depth of his other works
1442359315|5.0|Such a great story and written so well. I got the CD version so I could listen on my commute, which made it quick to get through, but I think I may be getting a hard copy so I can really read through it sometime. Working in the medical field, I was able to digest a lot of what Dr. Alexander was saying, but I can relate to some of the other comments stating it gets a bit confusing at times (again, another reason I would like to read it instead of listen to it). Overall, a great find and I will be sharing it with friends and family.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Condition of movie was great, I should have read the reviews closer, too much cursing and rotten language. Not good.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|Saw this in theaters and loved it so much I bought it. Kept you engaged from start to finish without profane words or uncomfortable sex scenes!! Story line is great and not easy to anticipate. Well worth the purchase and you can watch it with teens without squirming!
1250030951|5.0|When Cath and her twin sister Wren get ready to head to college, Cath takes for granted that the sisters will room together. But Wren doesn't want Cath for a roommate. In fact, Wren thinks that it's time that Cath gets over her shyness, her obsession with the Simon Snow book series, the Simon Snow fan fiction that Cath writes, and the fact that their mother left them as kids. Cath's fan fiction has been her entire life for so many years--how is she supposed to get over the only thing that has been a refuge for so long?<br /><br />Fangirl is possibly one of the best novels that presents an homage to nerdom of the early 21st century. Cath's story will resound with anyone who has ever preferred the company of books over people, and with those that willingly dressed up in costumes for midnight releases--multiple times. Cath's uncertainty throughout her first semester of college is palpable--she won't go to the dorm cafeteria because she doesn't know how it works--and her acerbic wit helps get her through all of the awkward moments. Roommate Reagan and her shadow Levi are endlessly entertaining and great friends, even though Cath is cautious of their kindness at first. The relationship between Cath and Wren is both complicated and simple; Wren isn't always very nice to her sister, but Cath loves her no matter what happens. Over the course of their first year of college their relationship changes a lot as each girl learns a lot about herself and each other before coming back to their shared love of Simon Snow. Rowell sprinkles excerpts from this fictitious series and Cath's own fan fiction throughout the novel to give a context to Cath's fandom, and they're a nice addition as long as they aren't taken too seriously. Complete with a tender, tentative romance that is just as memorable as the one in Eleanor & Park, Fangirl is an excellent coming of age story, hysterically funny and delightfully nerdy.<br /><br />Cover Comments: This cover surprised me when I first saw it--itreally reminds me of a graphic novel with the cartoon-like drawings and the speech bubbles. I don't think I'd ever seen anything quite like it on a YA cover (although it does resemble the cover for Eleanor & Park). I really like it, though! The colors are cool, but I hope it doesn't deter any male readers.
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|This game is great , lots of fun but on the nabi2 the tilt does not work ! I connot tilt the screen in this game and idk why . Please fix this !!!!!!!!
B006YTTVHO|3.0|The book was not bad for a free book. It focused a little too much on what we do wrong ( almost 60% of the book). However, the advice on what you should do was pretty practical. I wish there were more exercises for getting better.
B008200LHW|5.0|Received this receiver to replace my older GlobalSat that wouldn't work with Windows 8.  Loaded the drivers, rebooted  the laptop and in a short time was using my map program again.  Excellent product!
B00BCZU8WM|5.0|Justin Timberlake said, \\"I think there's probably a little bit of what was reminiscent on the first album and then a little bit of what's reminiscent of the second album, and then some new stuff,\\"  in regards to his highly anticipated third album, \\"The 20/20 Experience\\", and that statement couldn't be anymore accurate.<br />There's songs that sound like they could've been on \\"Justified\\" (Second single, \\"Mirrors\\", and funnily enough, this song also reminds me of Beyonce's 2009 hit, \\"Halo\\"), songs that could've been on \\"Future Sex/Love Sounds\\" (\\"Tunnel Vision\\", a great up tempo that's classic Timbaland), but thankfully, Timberlake also decided to experiment, and the results are wonderful.  Most of the album's songs start out one way, then morph and twist until they sound like an entirely different track, which is much appreciated, as most tracks are well over five minutes long.<br /><br />The most stunning composititon is the album closer, \\"Blue Ocean Floor\\".  It's the most experimental track and doesn't really fit with the sound of the rest of the album.  The use of ocean sounds and seagulls, along with ethereal synthesizers, strings, and piano make for an incredibly beautiful song.  Add in Timberlake's surprisingly evocative lyrics and earnest vocals and the song becomes otherworldly.<br /><br />Other highlights are the tribal sounding, \\"Don't Hold the Wall\\", the Latin-flavored, \\"Let the Groove In\\" (the latter sounds like a mashup of JT's 2003 smash, \\"Rock Your Body\\" and Jennifer Lopez's 2000 hit, \\"Let's Get Loud\\"), the mellow R&B cut, \\"That Girl\\", and the funky album opener, \\"Pusher Love Girl\\".<br /><br />The album is not without its flaws.  First and foremost, is Timberlake's voice.  It's quite weak and thin and is easily overpowered by the superb production, for the most part.<br /><br />I was also disappointed with Jay-Z's contribution to lead single, \\"Suit & Tie\\"; it mars what is otherwise a catchy and good song.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fantastic R&B album.  9/10.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|To be honest I was never the kid who always had their nose in a book. Sometimes I would fake read, Although when I found a book that was interesting I would of chores read it. My friend started talking about the sires Pretty Little Liars. I thought what a stupid book. But as far as peer pressure goes I finally gave in and read the book. It was terrific.I read this book and never stopped. Whenever I told myself next chapter I'll stop, something would keep me from putting the book down. Before I knew it I was racing with my friend on who could finish the series first. Did I tell you I was a slow reader. Well now I'm reading above average. The book got me engaged in reading. When you ask me whats my favorite book I reply The Pretty Little Liars series. some will say this book is not interesting and inappropriate. Yes this book is for those who are mature, and yes some people don't have the same taste as I do. So I would recommended this book not to be judgmental but I would recommend this book to teenage girls. So yes try this book it is VERY GOOD!!!
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|Kanye West's latest release, \\"Yeezus\\", may be his most polarizing album yet, if not the most polarizing album of the year.  The prolific rapper mixes industrial, hip-hop, and R&B beats with rabble-rousing titles and lyrics, impassioned vocals, and of course, a copious amount samples.  It's bound to be off-putting and offensive to at least a few people, but let me just say that right now I'm for the album and it's definitely my favorite of his releases thus far.<br /><br />The standout tracks are \\"New Slaves\\", where Kanye lashes out against how the establishment is keeping us all in debt; \\"Black Skinhead\\", in which Kanye rages against all the injustices he feels he has suffered as a black man;  \\"Blood on the Leaves\\" delves into a relationship that's turned acrimonious due to fame and money;  \\"Send it Up\\", a club banger that features a pulsating siren throughout; and \\"Bound 2\\", an R&B groove that has the album's best use of samples, although my favorite sample from the album is \\"Strange Fruit\\" from \\"Blood on the Leaves.\\"<br /><br />The only truly bad song is \\"Hold my Liquor.\\"  The beats are good, but the lyrics are lackluster and the autotune on the sung vocals is quite irritating.  Another complaint I have isn't necessarily about the album, but about all of Kanye's work: he relies far too much on samples.  I know he isn't the only one, but, seeing how boastful he is about himself (in \\"I Am a God\\", featuring \\"God\\" AKA himself, where he brags that he's the only rapper comparable to Michael, as in Michael Jackson, and that he brought real rap back), it'd be great to see what he can come up with all on his own.<br /><br />Overall, I'd give the album an 8/10.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|First of all the sound. Terrible. It was like someone placed a microphone in front of the stage and recorded all audio. This is not what I'd call HD master audio. Loads of echoes, reverberation, lack of dynamics and bass.  Sounds like it was in Mono.  It seems like they had to bring down the whole audio for Madonna voice to be heard.<br /><br />I have never heard anything this bad before.  As bad as you hear it from your TV speakers.  I was shocked.<br /><br />PLEASE DO NOT buy this concert.  I am trying to get my money back.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The intricate knowledge of the author of the methods and protocols and lingo our brave men and women that serve make his stories all too believable. Once you pick this book up... You had better have the time to finish it... Because its very hard to put down once you've started.
B001DU8T6I|4.0|CD WAS IN GOOD SHAPE. LOVED IT CANNOT WAIT TO LISTEN TO IT IN MY CAR. NO SCRATCHES THAT I CAN SEE.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so awesome!! I love it!! The only thing I have to say would be plz make a minion rush 2!!!!!!!!!!!
B005XUC398|5.0|I thought this was a great weeknight movie.  While it wasn't something I would have been raving over had I spent (ridiculous) big screen theater dollars on, for a free couch potato session at the end of the work day- this movie was great.  The actors are all on point with their emotions and reactions to situations.  Kevin Spacey's angst over his various life situations comes through the screen and makes the viewer identify with his character despite the clear situational differences from a big firm exec and an amazon.com weeknight streamer.  The ending is both abrupt, off-putting, and perfectly executed.  The themes of big businesses brining the 99% down is far from overwhelming, but actually presented in this round about fashion that draws the viewer in at just the right points.  Great movie, give it a watch....
B00BXLU1EU|3.0|This  app is great for every hacker on the move. Hack wifi and not get caught, i mean, i have not got caught yet
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game, you really have to use you thinking skills. I beat this game,  I really like this game! Wish there were more levels!
B00EPL4PBK|5.0|Bad ass. So different, so awesome, so insane. Love it. 3 new favorite songs on it. Solid drums, syn and Zack deliver as always, and shadows sets the bar a little higher this time.
0345803493|5.0|These were great books. Opened my eyes to a whole new way of looking at this type of behavior. Kept me wanting more. Zipped right through the series. Looking forward to the movie.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|My friends have this game, but we cant seem to connect with each other. Other than that glitch, its fun...if you dont mind playing with strangers. Also, wish I could change my avatar but there doesn't seem to be a way to do that either if you are connected through facebook.
B008602KQI|5.0|Much better than the movie. Recommend to anyone. A lot of action, unity on some of the characters and more.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|If you loved lemmings, you will love this. Great puzzle/strategy game for the young and old. Just wish you could make those bunnies move a little faster sometimes.
B0000AUHPB|5.0|The Italian Job. I know it has been remade with Mark Wahlberg and that is a great film, but this is the original, simpler, no CG effects and wonderful. Noel Coward as the criminal mastermind, Benny Hill as a computer whiz, would you believe and Michael Caine at the peak of his form. A fabulous caper movie with terrific set pieces, a fantastic car romp, an amazing advertisement for the original Mini. Did you know that Mini makers BMC weren't interested ? and the Italians happily offered Fiats for these scenes but the producers wanted British cars and the Mini's were immortalised. And the film's ending is one of the most inspired pieces of (forgive me) cliff hanging that has ever been put on film.<br />I recommend The Italian Job.
B005L38QK2|1.0|In the beginning, this mouse worked great for me and I was really happy with it. about a month in, it has started to have terrible tracking issues. I believe part of the reason is the cloth mouse pad I have been using which is by no means dirty, but does get a cat hair or 2 on it every now and then. apparently this mouse requires a pristine cloth to function well. I am now using it on the steelseries HD plastic mouse pad and it seems to work better but still has tracking issues every now and then and gets jumpy and innacurate. very disappointing. I assumed this was the same as the sensei but I have my doubts that the sensor in the diablo version is \\"tournament grade\\" like the other sensei's. Stay away imo steelseries engine I also believe is part of the cause to this poor performance. it's not a good design all around. to top it off, the braided cable is a dumb idea. it is very hard to straighten it out.... It came squiggly and I doubt i'll ever get it straight without breaking it. the cable makes a weird noise and creates friction when moving the mouse on the steelseries HD plastic mouse pad. i'm sorry I bought this thing. buyer beware, seek out a different company if you look on google there are plenty of people who have this jumpy cursor problem like I do. The combination of cheap sensor and terribly designed steelseries engine make this a bad choice. I will be submitting this review once I am able to hover over the send button after about 2 or 3 mouse jumps..... DO NOT BUY THIS CRAP PRODUCT
B006BXTOFC|5.0|from the minute you start this album, to the last few seconds of the last track, you will not be disappointed !!well worth the price, for years of listening!!
B009GEDP26|5.0|Season 5 is the best season so far.  Look forward to season 6 and the ever developing storylines.  Best hour of TV available today.
B008C1O8CA|5.0|I love the way Green Day has reinvented themselves since 2004 with American Idiot and 21st Century Breakdown, but this album brings me back to Nimrod!
B00EUIO8Y2|5.0|I saw the MDNA Tour in Cleveland, Ohio. Dont know what half of the people are talking about regarding the sound of the live recording. I got the digital version and sounds like a live album should sound like. People stop being so friggin' picky! if you want a studio album then get that...this is a live recording! my favorite tracks Vogue, Candy Shop among others.
0156027321|5.0|I finally finished this book. I read some reviews on here saying that the beginning was long, drawn out, and boring. They couldn't have been more right. I basically had to force myself to read it but it was well worth it. This book got exponentially better and I'm glad I got through it.
0810993139|5.0|This is a good book for young readers who like cracking up about dumb things.I liked this one the most out of the series.
B000WN60NG|4.0|This movie had a great plot, interesting, and great Blues music.  My husband had watched it years ago, and was happy to find it on Amazon Prime.  I ordered the original motion pictures sound track online at Amazon.com after watching, as a Birthday gift for him.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|LOVE DOWNTON ABBEY!!  The characters, the plot, the entire story is genius!  Thank you Masterpiece for bringing this story to life.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|It is easy to figure out the husband's secret but it is good reading anyway.  The ending is a bit vague so the author leaves it up to you to determine what happens after the secret is out.
0375842209|5.0|One of the best books/stories I've read in a long time. I'm recommending to all my friends and  my family!
1475143389|5.0|I read this book in one contiguous sitting... yeah it was that good.<br /><br />I have studied quite a bit about fitness, diet, exercise, etc. including being a level 1 certified CrossFit instructor. I view this book as capstone level reading material on the subject (the final piece of an arch that holds it all together).<br /><br />He starts off by breaking down and defining all elements of the human body, from muscle to organic foods to minerals he talks you through it all in the first 3 chapters (15 min. read time ~). He continues in that same vein throughout the rest of the book giving you specific and actionable things to do with your diet and exercises based on the best and most current science around.<br /><br />I wish I had this book years ago as an introduction to the subject of fitness! I don't really think I can recommend it highly enough!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The primary thing that bugs me, as a horse person, is the conformation of the horses, but otherwise it's really a pretty good app.
B0083GQVOC|5.0|I read the book years ago and loved it. Considering how the book is written (as a series of letters from Kevin's mother to his father), I had my doubts about how well this could be adapted for the screen. Color me impressed. In a rare occurrence for screen adaptations, I think they nailed it!
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I bought the first & second season to catch up on a show, I've always wanted to watch but came on late at night for me.  I enjoyed them!!  The DVD's played well in my MacBook Pro.  Hopefully I can get season's 4-5 once 5 is done.  Good price also!
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If you enjoyed the first season, give this one a shot! This is a masterfully done show, and I loved seeing actors from the first season take on new roles!
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Plays well in my MacBook Pro!  Loved the show and have been trying to catch up with it!  The show is in its last season and I will surely buy the rest!  The actors & acting is great!!  Sorry it took me so long to catch up to watching!

B002UZ5J72|5.0|This book was pretty good it was cool when Aslan came back to life and Susan an Lucy found out
B0017VG69U|5.0|I've been a fan since this came on back in the day.  If you're a fan of the original series, do yourself a favor and get this-or all three seasons if possible.  Remastering is amazing-allows you to see so many things that were not visible when the series was first televised.
B007HO392S|5.0|Bought it for myself for Christmas.  Haven't opened it yet.  That would be cheating and get me in trouble with Santa Claus
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Being a DJ I need that quick power nap. This is perfect for just those times. Works like a charm and very very easy to setup and use. Great app....well done.
B00CZF8B68|5.0|Pharrell is really doing his thing! Listening to this track puts me in the greatest mood! It's a simple song and just coooool. I have yet to see part 2, but the original movie was so cute and funny. A+++
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I have known about this app for awhile and finally got it. My sons play it all the time. Great app to pass the time and keeps them occupied. I love to hear them laugh.

B00D2HTRVQ|5.0|My almost 3 year old son loves &#34;fixing.&#34; Sorting and puzzle games are good. Art and color mixing are educational. Many games for the price.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|This is one of the best games out there,but by far the poorest managed.  It takes forever to get the games up and running.  The screens frequently freeze up.  Today I Was playing the five free tournament games. I was disconnected from two of them.  I wasn't given credit or a chance to replay the rounds.  I had 12 power bars left, but none of them would play. It just said I had to buy more power bars.  This is a cheating way of getting the player to spend more money. Unfair and unethical. Maybe we should avoid this game!
B00EDF43MY|4.0|Good games for helping the animals around the airport. In my opinion not as good as the grocery store and handyman Dr. Panda games but still fun and educational.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I bought this for my girlfriend and she loved it. Nothing to really complane about this product, but more choice of color could be much appreciated.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For those without smart TVs, it's fantastic.  I plugged it into my receiver and was up in minutes.  I have decent wifi and I've never had an issue.  I was finally able to get the Wii out of the livingroom and put it in my daughter's room to watch Netflix.
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|This app is better than any GPS you can buy. It gets me every place I need to go at the shortest distance and time possible. You can find a lost friend and help them. You can find out where problems are because waze tells you long before you get there. You can help other drivers too. I recommend this app to everyone I know and now to you.Best part, it's FREE!!! By far my favorite app!!!
B00DGNOMB6|2.0|Not really all that good.  Not bad, not good.  Guess I was under-impressed with it.  Expected more.  Ok if you are watching for free.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|good game. keeps you on yr toes. never know what to expect. makes sure you swipe fast. levels keeps updating and keep it interesting.
B00407PNY2|5.0|This is a classic DVD with Steve McQueen as his best in a town that is to die for-San Francisco. My cousin loved it as a gift from me!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Although there is a plethora of books that have been written on Nazi Germany, The Book Thief is an unforgettable story about a Christian girl's plight in a German town.  Definitely one of my top 10 all time favorite books and I would rate it a 5+ Star book.  I had a hard time putting this book down.  The author has chosen \\"Death\\" as the story's narrator.  Death provides interesting descriptions as well as foreshadows several of the events.  He  would often talk about life in colors and what he as well as the characters were feeling at the time of death as well as during the events leading to death.<br /><br />The book opens in 1938 with Liesel, her brother Werner, and her mother on a train.  Liesel's mother is taking the children to an orphanage when Werner dies on the train.  Within the week, Liesel loses her entire family and is struck with nightmares for years to come.  She is placed with a foster family and grows very close to her foster father, Hans, who is a painter.  Rosa, her foster mother, is a tough, rough around the edges, woman who takes in laundry to help support the family.  They have Jewish friends and after the Jewish people are swept from the town, Hans has less work than others because he never joined the Nazi party and is seen as a Jewish sympathizer.  However, the family has enough to survive.<br /><br />Because of her upbringing, Liesel has never learned how to read.  Hans teaches her to read each night after she is awakened by her recurring nightmare where she relives the death of her younger brother on the train.  She is initially put into a class that is well below her age, but within a few months gets moved to an age appropriate class.  She loves to read, but books are rare.  She takes to stealing them from the mayor's wife library one by one.<br /><br />Liesel's best friend, Rudy, is both smart and a gifted athlete. Rudy comes from a large family and he helps Liesel steal books and he steals food.  The two have many adventures and clearly share a love for one another.  Liesel brushes off Rudy's attraction for her in the beginning of the story, but recognizes that she indeed loves him by the end of the story.  Rudy is respectful as well as protective of Liesel throughout the book.<br /><br />Max is the son of a man who Hans fought with in WWI.  The man died in WWI and Hans promises the widow that if her family ever needed anything, that he would be there.  Hans is called upon 20 years later (after Kristal Nacht) as the family is Jewish and Max is hiding in need of help.  Hans takes in Max and hides him in the basement for several years.  He is the family's secret.  Liesel takes to Max and the author creates a touching relationship between the two characters.<br /><br />As the war progresses, Liesel's town is often subjected to air raid sirens and the neighbors are forced into basement shelters.  During these times, Liesel will read to the neighbors to pass the time in the basement.<br /><br />The story is full of family sacrifices from Hans/Rosa, to Rudy's family, Max as well as the crotchety next door neighbor.  The story has a very dramatic ending and not what I was expecting.  I did like that all of the characters stories were woven together very well and that at the end of the book, each character/sub-story line, had a defined ending (no hangers).  The last line of the book was just a few words spoken by Death: \\"I am haunted by humans\\".  It is an excellent read, a touching story of humanity, and a reminder of the horrific attrocities brought on by Hitler in WWII Germany.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Good story.  Good acting.  Only complaint is that it was a little long.  I wish I could find out where that island he was hiding on is located.
B004CFAWK2|5.0|Great book! The movie has some quotes but didn't stick close to the book. Keeps the reader interested! I would recommend this book!
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Patrick Rothfuss has created an amazing series with a highly entertaining lead character. The story, while it didn't progress much was engaging and left me wanting more!

B00A1XOPE8|5.0|I wasn't too keen on picking this one up, but Sanderson did a great job writing this story. For a light read this was well thought out and the magic system was interesting (as always).
B003H4I4JU|4.0|I have to say it's pretty good. It's not as good as the first o e but I mean it is the second book. I was kind of confused throughout this book because there were a lot of Brazilian and Portuguese words that I could not pronounce or understand so watch out  for that. Otherwise this is a great book.
1400052181|5.0|This book was purchased for my son that is in the eighth grade for the summer reading list. My son really enjoyed the book and so did I.
1609611543|5.0|I found the book to be informative.  Not only are there listings of what you cannot eat on the diet, but also, the author included some recipes to try.  Also,  I liked the examples of what happened when different people tried the diet.  I am a diabetic, so I was encouraged by the stories of those that were able to take less medicine after they lost weight and that some people were no longer diabetics once they dieted and lost the weight.  The author was a doctor so he left no stone unturned and told the reader everything they needed to know and expect.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A sad and realistic story that keeps you glued to the pages. I cried a number of times while reading.
B000V6BE6C|5.0|This CD got me into Avenged Sevenfold. The CD came out in 2007, but I discovered A7X and this specific CD right when I began High School in 2008. I had a few issues dealing with your standard teenage drama, and there was not a song on here that could not make me feel better. Now, onto the review...<br /><br />Top notch lyricism and instruments here. This album marks a huge departure from the A City of Evil era, which marked an even huger departure from the Waking The Fallen (also an incredibly good album) era. Upon first listen, I remember being ecstatic about the entire album. It was around 2006-2007 where I began to notice more and more original metalcore bands shift from metalcore over to a softer style of music. This album stood out and separated itself from the other bands that made this huge change. Why? I'll tell you why:<br /><br />Vocals:<br />M. Shadows is an incredible singer! I will agree that his voice is not THE BEST out there, but his method of delivering his voice really makes him unique. His method of delivery is a combination of shouts and soft singing throughout this album. Critical Acclaim and Dear God both highlight this unique talent. The vocals on nothing short of superb on here. There is not a song on here where I feel M. shadows underperforms or falls off.<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />Lyrics:<br />Well thought out. Deep. Powerful. Just a few ways to describe the lyrics. I can definitely relate to each song on this album. The lyrics are direct. They make a hard hitting statement that instantly delivers the message to the listener after the first listen. Nothing short of perfect<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />Instruments:<br />Although Avenged Sevenfold does not have the best guitar players in the entire genre of Rock, they definitely do deliver and bring something new to the table. From soft ballads, to hard hitting heavy metal anthems, Synyster Gates and Zacky Vengeance shine. Each solo is memorable, with Dear God being my all time favorite.<br /><br />The Rev (RIP) outdoes himself, as usual. Although I'm not a huge drum guy, I can appreciate his style and effort. He also contributes some much wanted vocals (Critical Acclaim, Afterlife, A Little Piece of Heaven, to name a few).<br /><br />5/5<br /><br />As far as bass goes, I feel that a lot of modern records have the bass mixed out in the mixing process so you can barely hear it. I've never listened to A7X for the bass skills, so I can't comment on that. Speaking of the mixing process, let's talk about the production.<br /><br />Production:<br />This is where I feel the album falls flat. The production, by no means, is terrible, but it can be better. I listened to this album in it's entirety in FLAC, and I felt I had other CD's from other artists who had better sounding records in MP3 format. I'm not an audiophile, but I like to listen to my music in it's highest quality. This, by no means, ruins the album listening experience. You probably won't even notice.<br /><br />4/5 as it's not terrible, but it's not something I'd expect from an album that's otherwise perfect.<br /><br />There is not a single song on here I don't like. My favorites? All of them. Every single one. If I had to pick my favoritest favorite, it'd be Dear God, followed by A Little Piece of Heaven, followed by Gunslinger. If you are a new fan, pick this up. It won't disappoint.
B008JFUO36|4.0|While not a Tom Cruise fan, I found Oblivion to be a film that engaged my mind and raised questions of Identity and the nature of what it is to be human. If I disregard the rather schlock ending, I must say that I enjoyed the film. The points raised were nicely nuanced and not presented in such a way as to cause blunt force trauma to the viewer.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Simple,easy,free and colorful! I saw it liked it and got it. It had good reviews. What could I lose? Try it.

B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|Enjoyed every second of it, a little over the top in places, but generally awesome. Girlfriend didn't even fall asleep! Rent/Buy this movie.
B0036EH3U2|5.0|You can really notice the difference with this Blue Ray, as compared to what you can watch on Netflix and tv reruns.<br />If you're a fan of dramas or science fiction, I recommend this series. While not for everyone, it manages to pack the emotional punches of a well written drama series, as well as the intellectual and moral quandaries of classic science fiction television. If you're looking for a straight remake of the original series, you may be disappointed, as this is a fair bit darker and just a bit more twisted. The characters are all lovable or hatable, and the climax is something I admit to not expecting.
0061950726|5.0|This is a great story that reads like really compelling non-fiction...It will have you googling away to learn more about the orphan trains.  The two parallel stories run seamlessly together and both main characters are interesting and totally believable.  This is a book that you will be recommending to friends!  It's a wonderful example of historical fiction with just the right amount of history intertwined with an amazing plot!

B00AZMFK3K|3.0|This is a very good movie and I thought a great deal:  Blu-ray, DVD and Digital copy for $19.99.  I followed the digital download process which includes me having to download iTunes (which I don't use).  It took over an hour for the download to finish and when it did I received a series of messages saying that none of the downloads worked.  When I tried to start over, my download code was no longer valid as it had been used.

B00AZMFK3K|2.0|A film adapted by--to paraphrase Monty Python--placing a old copy of the earlier films script on a piece of wood and banging a few nails through it.<br /><br />When the film \\"...Into Darkness\\" was released into theatres, I was bedridden with a spine injury and deliberately and successfully avoided reading or watching reviews or similar spoiler-y material.  Now that I own a copy, I really wish I hadn't.  I already own a copy of Star Trek II, enjoyed it on VHS, and bought it again a few years later when the DVD was released.  Now, I have another version, but this one occurs in an alternate universe with new characterizations that I mostly do not care for, lots of eye candy SFX that doesnt add a tinkers cuss to the storytelling, and scenes designed merely for their appeal to puerile impulses by a director and studio/franchise holder that has given up attempting to tell a NEW story and is merely trying to extract more money from a cash cow.  There is no reason that comes to mind to see this film over the original version of Star Trek II.  Fortunately for Benedict Cumberbach, he unlike Tom Hardy (the unfortunate from Star Trek Nemesis) will not likely suffer a serious career setback.<br /><br />Next time a Star Trek movie is released from JJ Abrams & Co, I will give it the exact care and consideration that I would a new Trek series headed by Rick Bergman and Brandon Braga; ie., none.
B0033TJATW|5.0|I had the original VHS recording and made a huge mistake by loaning it out.  Needless to say, I never got it back.  That was back in 1987 or 88, I think.  I have always searched for new copies but it was out of circulation for a while.  So, when I saw this DVD, I had to have it in my collection again.  I mainly ordered it for my 8-year old son.  We went and saw Beyonce in concert this summer and he was tremendously amazed.  I then wanted him to see Michael Jackson in concert and this DVD was a good introduction.  He has fell in love with Michael Jacson so much that I have started collecting all of his CDs to include HIStory.  I plan to buy them soon.  My son's favorites are Thriller, Smooth Criminal, Man in the Mirror, and Leave Me Alone.  Thanks to Amazon for this amazing offer that has impacted my son's life immensely.

B0055MBQOM|5.0|This is my 1st monitor calibrating equipment, have used it for about 6 weeks. Easy to install but do read all the directions first.  Prior to using this when I viewed my photos on a website they all had a greenish cast to them which I did not see on my monitor - now they appear as I see them at home.  There is little or no tech support but if you read/follow directions you should not have a problem.  I got the mid-level unit - wanted more than basic but did not need the highest end one.  Very happy I got it.
B007K3JCAE|4.0|Really enjoyed this 3D movie. Not in my opinion one for children under 12 years old. A fair bit of violence in this one but one I'll watch again.

B00DBQ0AV4|5.0|I got surprised to read the bad reviews. Well, perhaps when Callas and the other sopranos a reviewer recommends recorded this stuff, there was the same controversy. In first place, Netrebko was brave to pick-up a wide and demanding catalogue of arias. Macbeth is the most difficult one: Verdi needed a cruel voice to perform it and Toscanini, who considered this the most challenging opera scored by Verdi found it in Callas. They almost performed it together in La Scala, but the usual intrigues gave the podium to Victor da Sabatta. The arias that Netrebko recorded had in my Collection Callas as exposer, in the Verdi arias albums she left as legacy, mainly under Nicola Rescigno in the podium. Are Callas the best ones? Well, I should say yes. even taking into account the aria \\"Arrigo! Ah, parli a un core\\" in I Vespri Siciliani that was a recording Callas made in the sixties with a voice that was no longer what it was. How do we put Netrebko? As a great performer who visits the arias Callas immortalized (those of Macbeth and Don Carlo and Il Trovatore) in perfect shape. One thing that got my heart was that she recorded the cabaletta \\"Tu vedrai che amore in terra\\" that Callas recorded, I guess by the first time, for Leonora in Il Trovatore. This piece is rarely played after the Miserere Leonora sings and I could bet that Callas, under Karajan, were the first to leave that pretty piece recorded. I rarely hear it in any performance after and Netrebko takes it and sings it terrificly. The arias from Giovanna D'Arco are a revelation and I guess they are from  the earlier Verdi in his \\"gallera\\" period. The dramatic power of Netrebko is convincing and touch me. She was included in the Hall of Fame of Gramophone Magazine and I must say this is the first record I buy from her. I am one of those who thinks that there is nothing interesting after Callas, Tebaldi, de los Angeles and Sutherlad and I am starting to give new chances to the contemporary singers. I felt very well impressed about Netrebko. She has an outstanding colour and personality in her voice and it is in top shape. The orchestra is not the main issue,  but it is a very solid support actor under Noseda in the podium and even you have a brief intervention of Rolando Villazon in the Miserere of Il Trovatore. I get relief to see Opera carries on in the 21st century with great \\"singer actresses\\" as Netrebko. I was about to give 4 stars, but the cabaletta in Il Trovatore and the courage to go after Macbeth convince me: she deserves the five stars.

B004MPESSY|4.0|I wish the writers would've wrapped up the ending a little tighter.<br />Up until she shows up to meet the cops family, no one knew it was her killing the rapists-<br />now the cops wife and daughter can point her out.<br />I think the ending would've been better if she has called him and tricked him into believing she was in his house- then the cop rushes home only to find his wife watching the video- just as he walks through the door... then, in the background, you see tons of blue flashing lights and sirens from cops there to arrest him. Although the shotgun up the a$$ really made me shudder!

B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|Unlike European and Asian folktales, that have been recorded in books for centuries, stories from Africa have been passed down by word of mouth until very recently. That would explain the rarity of African folktales on our bookshelves; and also the uniqueness of the stories, for a story changes just a little bit with every retelling. It is, however, important to preserve these tales for the future generations with no further corruption from the outside world. Such writers as King Samuel Benson, who record these stories for posterity, are, indeed, doing all us a great favor. However, it is only fair to note that the writer mentions that he has \\"carefully re-written them to suit a modern audience.\\" Still, while the tales might have some of the modern references, the core morals and lessons remain intact.<br /><br />This particular collection contains three stories: \\"Why Newborn Babies Can't Talk,\\" \\"Why the Tortoise is Bald,\\" and \\"Why Pigs are Attracted to Refuse Dumps.\\" These are morality tales, each teaching a lesson in concise form. These are mostly short animal fables, with the greedy Tortoise, with whom we became familiar in the first tome of Tales \\"by Twilight\\" making an appearance in the two of the stories. The first story, \\"Why Newborn Babies Can't Talk,\\" is of particular interest, because unlike in the majority of African folktales, it talks about humans, their perceived morals, and how a divine consequence can follow a seemingly correct action.<br /><br />Both \\"Tales by Twilight\\" books are a delightful read and recommended to those who enjoy folktales.
B001WCN232|5.0|Thank you for the CD. Arrived on time and as described. I will look for more music from your site in the future.
B00F2ZL8H2|5.0|In WHY NEWLY BORN BABIES CAN'T TALK and Other Stories, King Samuel Benson has once again brought together a small group of classic folktales, interpreted and retold for our modern ear. The author has a warm and gentle way in telling these tales. One of my favorites begins, \\"Many, many years ago when animals could still talk, there lived the first clan of animals in a remote village in Africa.\\" This was an enjoyable read filled with lessons and culture. It makes a nice companion to Tales by Twilight (A Collection of African Folktale).

B00E5Q1LTY|2.0|While I enjoyed JJ Abrams first reboot of the Star Trek franchise I found the second to be totally lacking although I did enjoy the opening sequence. This so called summer \\"thrill ride\\" is all 'thrill' and very little 'ride.'  Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan is still my favorite of all the ST movies. This movie is a travesty of that one. If there is to be a third film in this series, PLEASE Mr. Abrams go back to ST's original strong point: good writing. In my opinion Gene Roddenberry would not have Been pleased with this film.

B00000JSJC|3.0|This was a very ambitious film that cost 40+ million dollars, but only recouped something like one sixth of that. You will see many familiar faces, something like an ensemble cast. The set design seems quite elaborate, and I am sure they studied Bladerunner extensively for not just the set design, but to a lesser degree perhaps even the plot. In some ways, James Cameron's story is in fact even more complex than Bladerunner.<br /><br />So, why is this movie corny as hell? Well, it's hard to say exactly. It is deserving of cult status for the most part, and I would have really liked it for it's campy dated appeal, had there not been one (almost two) horrific rape scene. There have been many much worse rape scenes in other movies before, but not many I sat through. In fact, I wish there was a warning on any movie containing rape; had there been in this case, then I would have certainly avoided this movie.<br /><br />Otherwise, this is a perfectly decent schlocky and unintentionally tongue-in-cheek type of film with many hilariously outdated references to the year 2000 being the end of the world, $3 gas prices being the beginning of the end, and Minidiscs being the preferred medium of the not-so-distant future. You can tell that the director was excited about the project, surely thinking it would fall somewhere between Die Hard (IE: the balcony scene) and Bladerunner, when in fact, it reads on the screen more like Robocop 3, with absurd costumes, characters, and peculiar film dialogue cliches thrown around right and left.<br /><br />Had the rape scene never happened, it's likely I would recommend this to friends as one of those awesomely bad films you just have to see, but as it stands, it's just a touch too sadistic in a scene or two, that make the camp harder to laugh at and enjoy. I loved the horribly designed and acted \\"rapper,\\" and Bassett's very En Vogue 90's hairstyle...it makes 5th Element look like one of the great wonders of the world, by comparison.<br /><br />\\"Is this movie any good though?\\" I don't know, could you handle a particularly sadistic rape scene in the middle of Johnny Mnemonic or Bladerunner? You probably could, but I think we can all agree that those films were better without that. I have to suspect that, while this event is pivotal to the film's plot, it also may have been the barrier that prevented it from coming anywhere close to making it's money back. Too bad, after all the success Kathryn Bigelow had with Point Break before this, and several successful ones after this, this film at least had cult classic potential. I'm sure some people see it that way./>\\"Is this movie any good though?\\" I don't know, could you handle a particularly sadistic rape scene in the middle of Johnny Mnemonic or Bladerunner?

He sits in the corner of the couch and tells us, \\"I'm gonna read to you\\" and then he proceeds to tell us a made up story about the pictures. When we read the book to him at bedtime, he always says, \\"Whoa! That's awesome.\\" He says it no matter how many times we read it to him. All-in-all, very happy we got this book.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Wonderful games interesting app makes you think absolutely love this game  So neat  fun I could play for days and days
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King's writing style draws you in and takes you for a real Carolina Spin in this non-horror thriller. :)
0446547638|5.0|Good story that relies on the characters and their conflicts rather than sex and violence to engage the reader.  The ending was sad yet provocative and spiritual. A very thought provoking story.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|This is a great album. I don't have a favorite song because I listen to them all so often. If you haven't seen her music videos you should be sure to check them out.
057809665X|4.0|The book's goal is to teach you how to talk to other people, in particular to strangers, in a way that will make them share information that they may not otherwise share. The book describes 10 methods, one per chapter, and gives abundant examples and exercises to practice.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Ready to use methods with clear explanations.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- The advice is sound but the book felt a bit like a random bag of tricks involving body language, listening skills, psychology and generosity. If you are interested in a deeper coverage or a more thorough treatment you are better off looking for specialized books.<br />- The ratio of content to examples is too unbalanced towards examples. Without the examples you could easily summarize the contents of the book in a couple of pages.
B003F46RVO|5.0|Great movie, pretty funny, has some gore, it is an old movie but it has all types of scary scenes
B008JFUUIA|5.0|I've watched this movie many many many times and I never get tired of it.  So funny so entertaining.  It always lifts my spirits.  And I'm excited to hear that Pitch Perfect 2 is in the works.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I was glad to get in on the first day and get this with 2 day shipping from Amazon rather than pay Google $9 to ship it to me. It took a little longer but I did get in on the Netflix 3 month trial which is great. Took only a few minutes to setup and I was off and streaming HD YouTube and Netflix to my 37&#34; Insignia. Looking forward to Amazon Prime video support in the near future...Amazon, are you reading this?!
B001DJLD1M|5.0|All are the original dvd release. Special features and all. Must have if you are a Matrix fan. If you do not like the Matrix, move ojn, nothing to see here.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The first Neil Gaiman book that I have read.  A great sci-fi fantasy novel with fascinating characters and an imaginative plot.  I plan to read a lot more by this author.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I actually did not start watching The Big Bang Theory unitl a few months ago. Within that time, I have purchased all six seasons on dvd. So yes, it is that good. The combination of the science geeks trying to find love and fit in with their definition of what is cool gives it a unique spin. I love the way that Sheldon insults his friends at every opportunity about their intellect, or lack thereof. Raj who is always afraid to speak to women, but looses all inhibitions with a taste of alcohol. Howard, the inappropriate mommas boy, surprisingly is the first to actually commit. Leonard still trying to win Penny's complete devotion is sometimes sad, but often endearing. Oh gosh, Amy, you are not sure what direction she is coming from most time, but be sure it ends up with her trying break through Sheldon's walls. Hilarious fun.
B00DKY4LBW|5.0|Don't bother writing a review that says \\"Why don't they go back to Whatever People Say I Am\\" or \\"I prefer Favourite Worst Nightmare.\\" This is one of those rare bands that changes a lot from record to record, and AM is no different.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great app for children, teens, and even adults. It is beautifully made, and one can easily lose track of the time playing it.
B005L38QK2|4.0|And I dont even play much diablo 3 anymore.  Only downside to this mouse is 112233222, i just wrote that with the extra buttons and the mousewheel is only one button, not side to side.  but hey its a gaming mouse and its precise and relatively cheap
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Hands down one of the best movies I have ever seen!<br /><br />Dont watch the first half hour and give up on it. Stick around and everyrhing starts to flow so well and by the end all your questions will be answered.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Why do I have to write a paragraph about why I rated it the way that I did. That's my business. Just let me give a movie five stars if I wanna give it five stars. I had a blast watching this.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I love this book and can't wait to read the rest of this series I will be getting them Friday. Once I started reading this book I had a hard time putting it down until I finished it. Each page was better than the last one this book was about lose getting your life back learning how to find happiness and trust I recommend this book.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Survivalcraft is awesome but I want to have more time to play the game like since the demo is free why can't the REAL game be free some parents don't have enough money to go out and put money on their card so we can get this game or go out and get an Amazon card and I'm not lying or exaggerating but this is the forth time I've downloaded this game cuz every world has a limited time period and then all of the world's run out of time eventually now don't get me wrong,survivalcraft is addicting to me at least but I want more tome to play this game. Thank You.  :)
B007LGPSX0|5.0|Gteat series from the 1990's. It was on the air for over a decade. Just dont mind their clothing choices.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|Oh, Taylor Swift - you melt my heart with your music. I don't think Taylor is capable of producing a bad song. Her voice is incredible and she writes all of her own songs. Truly talented artist.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Honestly, the dynamics in this book. I can't even express how much of a page turner this was. I ignored my boyfriend multiple nights to read !
B00BQLSB3A|3.0|Christine is a John Carpenter film based on Stephen King's great novel. It's about a demonic car and it's much better than it sounds. It is fairly loyal to the novel and one of King's more enjoyable screen adaptations. Overall, I would say the picture quality is very good and the audio is decent on this Blu-ray when compared to the DVD. Christine comes with over an hour of bonus content, an audio commentary and an isolated score. However, there is no exclusive content for this release. My only real complaint is that this Limited Edition Blu-ray is selling for $120 due to it being out of print now. Fans will have to decide for themselves if the upgrade is worth it. This Twilight Time release has managed to hold its value more effectively than Body Double.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />Audio Commentary featuring John Carpenter and Keith Gordon.<br />Deleted Scenes (480i; 26:02)<br />Ignition (480i; 11:52)<br />Fast and Furious (480i; 28:55)<br />Finish Line (480i; 7:17)<br />Isolated Score is presented via DTS-HD Master Audio 2.0.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy Baldacci books.  This one was full of suspense and intrigue.  Surprise ending was amazing.  I have given it to other people for a must read.
B001ECQ6E2|4.0|Christians will love this 1951 epic. It is about a Roman army commander (Marcus Vinicius) who is struggling to find himself in Ancient Rome. He meets a woman (Lygia) and is influenced by the apostles of Jesus. St. Peter travels to Rome to meet followers in caves during a period of early Christianity when the religion was not accepted by Roman society. The picture quality is great (much better than the DVD) but the audio is average (mono only). There is roughly an hour of bonus content (all ported over from the DVD) and an audio commentary. The amount of language and subtitle options is very impressive.<br /><br />Audio Formats: English Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono, French Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono, Castilian-Spanish Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono, Latin-Spanish Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono, German Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono, Italian Dolby Digital 1.0 Mono<br />Subtitles/Captions: English Subtitles, French Subtitles, Spanish Subtitles, Chinese Subtitles, Danish Subtitles, Dutch Subtitles, Finnish Subtitles, German Subtitles, Italian Subtitles, Korean Subtitles, Norwegian Subtitles, Portuguese Subtitles, Swedish Subtitles<br />Special Features: Behind the Story, Commentary by F. X. Feeney, In the Beginning: Quo Vadis and the Genesis of the Biblical Epic, Theatrical Trailer, Teaser Trailer<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game but almost has to do too much to get tickets. And don't like how you can't change screen view, take the new goals off screen or move around to all areas of screen.
B0097A2LTW|3.0|Starring Sarah Jessica Parker, Paul Reubens, Veronica Cartwright, Cliff De Young, Matt Adler, and Robert Small.<br /><br />This is a wonderful Disney film about time travel. A boy leaves Earth unknowingly in 1978 and returns to his family eight years later when his perception is he was only gone for a few hours. He befriends an alien with a spaceship to devise a way to travel back to his own time. Oddly, this film often gets overlooked as many people haven't heard of it. It never seemed to get much promotion in the Disney library despite being a very good movie. It is perfect for the entire family (there is nothing objectionable about it except one or two curses). The story is interesting, the performances are good and the music is enjoyable. The special effects are also fairly good for its era. It hasn't lost any magic for me but teenagers may find some of the ideas cliche now. It is similar to ET but better (in my opinion). The plot has more substance then you might expect for its intended audience. My only complaint would be Pee Wee Herman as the alien's voice does get old after awhile but young kids will find it funny. A remake is in the works so a new generation of fans can appreciate the story. It has only one bonus feature (audio commentary by Director Randal Kleiser). Subtitles are English SDH only.<br /><br />This Blu-ray must be imported so ensure you have the appropriate equipment to play Region B/2 discs. Most US Blu-ray players can play discs from other regions (unlike US DVD players) but if you haven't purchased an imported Blu-ray before some people do have the occasional problem with them. If that's a concern then check out the US DVD version of this enjoyable flick. This is a 4 star film in a 3 star release.
0762445262|1.0|no it did not meet my xpectations i ordered 2 batman signal lights and received only 1 i am very frustrated
B000089RV6|5.0|I bought this to replace my 90's version of the CD.  The old Cd's just don't have the volume of today's newer Cd's. This remastered version sounds awesome on the iPod and is a must for AC/DC fans.
1416955070|5.0|Daughter loves it, wants the series. Maybe another Hunger games, or twilight thing. Better her read than watch tv, so I supporting book buying, or renting

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I am completely obsessed with these books!!!!!!! I can not wait until catching fire comes out on November 22-2013 and I will die!!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|A super- Super Hero movie!  Tons of action!  Twelve more words, how stupid is this?  Waste of time, mine and yours
0385340990|5.0|I admire the use of letter correspondence dialogue to tell the tale. Once you got used to it, it seemed like the only way this story should be told. Everything wrapped up at the end to a reader's satidfaction.<br /><br />if you watched the Canadian tv-miniseries (6 part) &#34;Island at War&#34; production, you would recognize much of the plot material in this book. Different characters and somewat improved German occupier conduct, but at the same time so reminiscent of this book's little story.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|Great book....finally the world makes sense again. Like all the puzzle pieces fit together again. The history of how the \\"extrovert\\" has been groomed in America was fascinating. Yes, will everyone please shut up! Worth every penny!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Not going to spoil anything! Lots of plot twits & turns. Hero's saving the day. Certain folks getting their comeuppance, and rightfully so. Happy tales, sad tales. Cast is as witty as always... Love Maggie Smith! Season 4 will bring w/it some unexpected changes & I just can not wait for the start of it all in Jan. 2014.
1577314808|1.0|Worst book ever sounds like the guy was relaying a trip on LSD. I wish I could have rated it zero stars!!!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|This movie had an interesting twist on a zombie themed movie.  It allowed zombies a way to become normal again and provided a reason why zombie liked to eat brains!
B0007PLLQ0|5.0|Just as good as I remembered it from my childhood. Kind of a dark scary side to it, but also a bright, cheery side. Love this movie!
B0042U94UQ|5.0|What a great movie! My daughters and I loved this movie! Great movie if you need a giggle!I would highly suggest buying this movie!

1451695187|5.0|This is very well written and intriguing.  Whether you believe his experience is real, or not, the way he weaves the complicated medical details with personal history and the fantastical experience itself makes it a great read.<br />Highly recommend the book no matter your religious affiliate or personal belief.
B003O86FMW|4.0|No way did I see that coming. Great change of pace while holding on to the story at the same time.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|Of all of my games, this is my second best.  It is a great way to pass the time with  enough strategy to ward off boredom.  I keep coming back to The Call of Atlantis!
0812993845|5.0|This book is hilariously funny! I listened to the audio version on playaway from my local library. I was laughing at loud as I listened to Lottie & Fliss' escapades. Definitely a fun read or listen. This is the 2nd book that I have listened to of Sophie Kinsella and I would recommend the author to everyone.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Works great even in our rural area where it's tough to get signal. My son actually is principle user of this kindle and he can't wait to show off how he can see the weather.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|It really makes you think about disease, death, and life after death.  Death shpuld not be a morbid topic...but one to understand and not fear.  I liked the openness of the author and the quality way she expressed her experiences and feelings.  Very excellent read!
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|Daniel Radcliffe is an extrodinarily good young actor. this movie was a very dark and at times creepy movie but it kept your interest. recommend it for anyone who like Radcliffe and enjoys a movie that keeps you interested.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I was not convinced when my sister told me to read the book.  But I finally I decided to go ahead and download to my kindle.  So glad I did because I think in all honesty it is the best book I have read in a very long time.
B009RX8MQ0|5.0|I ORDERED THIS TV DVD SERIES SET ONE DAY AND IT CAME THE VERY NEXT DAY! IT CAME OUT 8/20/13 OF WHICH I KNEW AND I ORDERED IT THAT DAY. NOBODY ELSE HAD THIS SERIES. FROM NOW ON I WILL DO MOST OF MY SHOPING WITH AMAZON.COM. OH THE SET CAME IN SPOTLESS CONDITION AND NEW. I'VE JUST NEVER HAD THAT FAST A SERVICE! IT'S A SHAME THAT ALL OF AMAZON.COM'S ORDERS AREN'T THE SAME WAY?
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|If you like action and you like comedy, but tend more towards action, then this is the movie for you.  It doesn't take itself too seriously, but it's a lot of fun.<br /><br />It's your typical super-agent genre, featuring highly trained (former) operatives with insane levels of skills and abilities and some humor thrown in for good measure.  This movie is cut from the same cloth as &#34;This Means War&#34;, &#34;Mr. & Mrs. Smith&#34; or TV's &#34;Burn Notice&#34; so, if you like those, there's a good chance that you'll like this.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I can't stop playing. It is what i was looking for, you feel like a mayor of a city and you can modify the land at your preference. I recomend it.
B00ECU2RGY|1.0|The download showed it completed but after viewing 1/3 of the movie...it just froze. Couldn't get past that one picture of Tom Cruise. I can't find any place on amazon to file a complaint, request a re-download or a refund. Totally unwatchable.
B00881PTRC|5.0|Love using this app. I love the pre-made categories and I love that I can make my own categories. So fun and cute graphics!
B0042J6VUS|5.0|The Mini Adjustable Tripod+camera stand is an excellent device.  It hold my iPhone 5 great with plenty of adjustments that work right.  I also bought a 2nd unit for my sons iPhone 4 as he makes videos often.
B008YKGQR4|4.0|It lets me keep in touch with what's happening,but none of the games will load up. Not complaining however, after all it is free and I do appreciate it.<br />I get it on my kindle fire Hd so Thank you.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Very nice graphics and a fun game to play. I hope everyone enjoys our as much as I do.  It's a simple time killer.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Show kept you going.  My wife, son, and I guessed until the end but were wrong!  When you add magic into a thriller, that doubles the effect.  One of the best shows we've seen in awhile.
B009LQKHIO|5.0|I didn't want to put book down. Goes along like most &#34;I am not looking for a relationship&#34; deals but the characters pull you in and hang on to you. Few errors here and there but doesn't distract. Will be getting the next book ASAP.
B000OLROWC|5.0|Although the movie is geared more toward the juvenile audience, it has such a good plot as to attract anyone. Unique and good plots are scarce with so many movies churned out of the same old cookie cutter. I watch a lot of movies and throw out many, many of them before even getting to the end. I watched this one all the way to the end knowing what was going to happen. So I was right and happy it had all the ingredients of a good story.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|What  stars what a cast  I am very happy this was restored  It is one of the greatested film's to own
1400069289|4.0|This book is so interesting and really explains marketing trends and why we buy what we buy. I loved it.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|great for all occasions, chill and fun, easy listening.  listen to this all the time with the whole family and love it.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|The book was disjointed and very difficult to follow.  The Arabic names of at least 50 characters were extremely hard to keep track of without writing them down as each was introduced into the story.  A very hard read.  Totally unlike Mr. Hosseini's &#34;Kite Runner&#34; unfortunately.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This seemed to take entirely too long to read, often I found myself having to walk away from the book for a day or two. As with the other books, I would grow interested with a character only to have the chapter end and not hear from them again for many more chapters, sometimes 100 pages. Oddly, near the end of this book, I realized how brilliant a tactic this was: how many characters did I fret over wondering what happened to them? We're they truely dead, would I hear from them again in this book? I felt very connected to their fellow characters in their own doubts.<br />I did not truly get into the book until after page 600 where up until then it was only a few characters. After that point Martin branched out more causing the story to speed up to the point that end actually took me by surprise.<br />Despite the fact that I will be taking a much needed break from the series I'm pretty sad the next book isn't out yet.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Fantastic! Can't wait to read them all. The movie is also great, fantastic actors, they brought the book to life.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|Alittle slower moving than I expected. Slightly disappointed after hearing the reports of others. Just isn't in my top 10.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Easy to use and just enough features to make me happy. I use it as my bedside clock &amp; alarm clock. Love that I can use my own music to wake me up. Paid for the ad free version with a few extra features and no problems so far.
B002ZG99QS|5.0|I loved the original Tron movie and when this came out on DVD I had to get it. I was not disapointed. The purchase was excelent and the movie was great. I'm not the least bit sorry I bought it.
B00DQVST76|3.0|I'm actually happy to read that some people are having different problems than me because it means that things must be working right for somebody else! The DTS 5.1 audio track plays on all channels except right-front, and I actually had to rip the DVD to get it to play properly on my Windows 7 home theater PC. A couple of players were able to play the DVD just fine, but some of them (eg. Windows Media Player, Windows Media Center) had scrambled video after the copyright warnings. In all media players, and on both the ripped and standard DVD, the 5.1 audio track was missing its right-front channel. And yes, *I* know how to fix the issues, but that doesn't mean everyone will.<br /><br />That said, I was surprised how grainy some of the footage was, especially compared to her previous tour videos. I also agree with a great many fans that these videos are getting way too overproduced, because the performance here is truly one of her best and her sound is coming through much cleaner than her last few tours. Perhaps an extra \\"angle\\" track just showing a variety of steady shots would appease both sides? Thankfully I was able to watch the \\"Madonna MDNA Tour Full Concert (Europe Version)\\" on YouTube which was a surprisingly well-edited sequence of mostly camera-phone footage (and audio) which actually seemed more impressive in terms of depicting the performance at hand, despite the abysmal quality. That said, this entire performance will certainly be near my list of her best, it's just a shame that the overproduction of the video takes away from some of the genuine magic her amazing crew pulled off this round.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Some parts are tough to wade through as the section on sewers but the expounding on the ways of humans and how we treat one another is good food for any soul wishing to bring peace on earth to all men.
B003E20ZQA|5.0|This is one of those biographies that feels real.  This is Patti Smith telling you directly about her experiences and her memories of those experiences.  It is what every good book is, like listening in to a really good conversation.<br /><br />And for all those old hippies, those of us who were around in the sixties, it will jog some of your own memories too.
B00CT5NDHQ|3.0|This was a blind buy for me. I bought it based on my expectations and I did no prior research before purchasing. Now I have a Sliver blu-ray that to me is no better than the unrated DVD. The video and audio quality is better but I hate that it is not unrated. This is my fault though as I should have researched myself.
B00CATSONE|5.0|This is the first actual mini biography i found about the father of electricity. What a remarkable book. I couldn't stop reading - it was so well written, thank you so much for ths great book. Thank you!
0439023521|3.0|I had few preconceived notions about \\"The Hunger Games\\" when I started reading it because I'd managed to avoid a lot of the hype that surrounds popular books. (I know: Figure that one out.) Most of the details I'd come by had been related by a friend, who said the book was interesting and worth reading. She was right on both counts and I did enjoy it.<br /><br />However, it wasn't the ubertome I'd expected from what buildup I'd been exposed to. The plot is engaging enough, but I kept finding myself thinking of Stephen King's \\"The Running Man,\\" with a little bit of \\"Logan's Run\\" thrown in for good measure. When I tried to put my finger on why I felt that way, I concluded that the book had originality but didn't quite manage to break the mold of dystopian commonplace.<br /><br />The main thing that kept me from being unequivocally enthusiastic about the book is this: I didn't find it believable that the people of Panem accept their fate unquestioningly, behaving uniformly like sheep patiently awaiting their turn in the abattoir. They have the ability to get outside the Seam's electrified enclosure and flee their prison because the electricity rarely works and there's a hole in the fence. Why in the world don't they take advantage of it and escape the district? There are no armed forces keeping the residents in check, no tracking devices on the citizens of the districts. Anyone with a modicum of sense wouldn't hang around long enough to undergo the reaping and chance being forced into the Hunger Games, or watch their loved ones be slaughtered in them, or expose their children to that risk. Gale actually suggests leaving, but Katniss thinks the idea is preposterous. We're never told why it's such an outrageous proposition, however. It seems as though she should jump at the chance because her little sister, whom she loves very much, is now eligible for the reaping.<br /><br />If you're fond of dystopian tales or simply a likeable story, you'll enjoy this book. It was entertaining and at times engrossing, and I plan to read the rest of the series.<br /><br />I was surprised by the careless editing. The Scholastic imprint used to mean that the book it graced would be well edited, with hardly an error. Not any longer. Examples of the many mistakes include subjunctives (\\"Better he does [do] it in the woods\\"), word choice (\\"skinny arms around me like a vice [vise]\\"; \\"I hear the anthem that proceeds [precedes] the death recap\\"; \\"the others will be honing [homing] in\\"; \\"trying to staunch [stanch] the flow\\"), verb inflection (\\"the front bakery bell rung [rang]\\"), comma splices (\\"I have Peeta to clutch for balance, he is so steady\\"), and spelling (\\"the blood bath [bloodbath] at the\\"). The number of errors was jarring but not enough to ruin the book for those who pay attention to such things.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|So I think I'm in the minority here, but it took me quite a while to get into Wool.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I was listening to the audiobook for a lot of it, and the reader had a slower voice than I'd prefer (I know you can speed it up on the audible app, and I tried that but it didn't sound right). She was a very good reader, very expressive with lots of voices for the different characters, she was just slow.<br /><br />Or maybe it was because (spoiler alert) the viewpoint characters kept getting killed off. I had a hard time investing in anyone after that.<br /><br />I'm also a bit tired of dystopian fiction, though this is more original than a lot of the YA stuff out there. I did appreciate the varied cast of female characters, and the thought that Howey clearly put into the ecosystem of the silo. The writing was usually tight, though it occasionally drifted into self-indulgent description. The plot took a while to get going, probably because it was a series of novellas, but it did pick up steam and became quite compelling. I may continue on with the series, depending on how much dystopian fiction I think I can continue to take.
B005F9CPG8|5.0|Will we see 4 guys with so much talent and music genus. While I bought this cd elsewhere I will buy more here for xmas presents. While this just there number one hit there could be several number ones. There were that good. I am a audiophile(on a budget) and am not crazy about cd's. There are good for the car and not for quality. Music is a wave. not 1's and 0's. But this is better than not hearing anything all, especial for young people who never heard the Beatles.I just listened to yellow submarine on the cd and then played it on the record. The difference is huge. So if can get the ORIGINAL records you hear them the way they were meant to be. Some early records sound a little simple. but the music is great.No fancy overdubs and tricks. Just great music from the most talented group that ever played there style of rock and roll. I really don't know how with all the fame they stuck together for as long as they did. I do know I am happy they did.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Absolutely phenomenal!  Beginning to end,  incredible writing and storyline. Had a hard time when reading the ages of the main characters. They were so young. Don't be fooled this is an excellent book with mature issues. Looking forward to reading Losing Hope.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|My 3 daughters (2 x 6 yr olds and 1 x 4 yr old) love this movie. They always want to watch it. It's nice to have a cute, clean movie for them to watch. Great Job Disney.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Perfect! So many awesome characters with so much action and plenty of story line to keep you thinking. Each of the main characters had plenty of screen time and did their part.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Can find most popular songs from any era, great sound quality. Great music downloader. This app is my main music source
B00B7VZN76|5.0|I previously owned the non-blu-ray version, and the new blu-ray version is so much better quality viewing, especially with the modern TV's. Of course, season 3 was when the cast and the whole production really came together. It was an excellent season, much better than the first two seasons. There were a number of really good episodes, such as Who Watches the Watchers, The Enemy, The Most Toys, and the Best of Both Worlds (part 1).

B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I bought this thinking that I would finally be able to watch Amazon Instant Video on a big screen. AFTER I bought it, they changed the code and BLOCKED video from \\"non-approved\\" sources (e.g., Google's own websites like YouTube). So, the things you can use it for are extremely limited -- they are things I can already cast from my Tivo.<br /><br />(Speaking of Tivo, I can BUY or RENT Amazon videos through my Tivo, but I cannot watch content that I have already paid for with my Prime subscription...which is another source of Amazon frustration.)
B00E3VTR1K|5.0|This collection of sci-fi and fantasy short stories transported me not so much into the future as back into the heyday of the genre when pulpmeisters like Heinlein and Van Vogt and Sturgeon and, yes, even L. Ron Hubbard were cranking out their Amazing and Fantastic Tales. Rossi's title gets it right--these stories overflow with galactic energy and possibilities. A vampire domme sucks the will and blood out of a starship captain; a startup software team takes over the world, or appears to; an innocent solar scientist is hunted down and imprisoned in a Kafkaesque nightmare scenario, never knowing why; a mutant bounty hunter falls in love with his sexy-shape-shifting captive. Rossi possesses a unique style and voice, combining dreamlike imagery and surreal situations, with--a word of caution here--frequent dollops of kinky eroticism.

B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Was really surprised at how little historical fact was known about John Wilkes Booth.  This movie really summarized the times historically and presented both sides of the conflict in a more understanding way.
B00CATSONE|4.0|Rather than a strict biography, there is also a message of personal achievement. The biographical information helps<br />illustrate how each of us can achieve greatness in our chosen field. Well done, Mr. Patrick.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Incredibly well researched, follow it and beat the sugar/sweet addiction that starts in our baby days with well intentioned parents and their &#34;If you are good I will buy you a chocolate/ice cream/ etc&#34;. This eating with its high protein intake actually works and best of all it kills that gnawing hunger that defeats all our best efforts with more conventional &#34;diets&#34;<br />This menu style worked fantastically with many of my overweight/obese clients.<br />The hardest hurdle is getting used to the lack of white flour and actually believing this weight loss and lifestyle regimen.<br />Try it for a month, you have nothing to lose but your weight and cravings!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|This is a really good movie. Why did it get a low ratings from others? Because it's not cheesy hollywood flicks like total recall.

B00E3D7WGU|2.0|This is the WORST of all the Madonna tour videos (and I have them all). I saw this concert live in Medellin, Colombia (where it was supposed to be recorded). This Miami concert is sooo bad. The sound is horrible, the people are pathetic (remember Buenos Aires and juxtapose the two audiences) and it is rather painful to watch when it should be just a lot of fun. I was so disappointed with this tour video.
0345472322|5.0|Loved the concepts and I think it might help to resolve conflict on the job and assist the young adults in my family as they launch the rest of their life.

B005XZHQKY|4.0|This is an ABSOLUTE must have!,if you have a 3D TV,The 3D is some of the best,I HAVE EVER SEEN FOR THE SMALL SCREEN!, I DO NOT advise paying more than $22.00 US for it, and you can find it cheaper than that, also if you don't have a 3D TV , just rent it, trust me.
B00003CXA6|5.0|The true story of the Gettysburg Battle.  This film gave you a true feel of what it was like during this horrible battle of brother against brother, North against South. After visiting Gettysburg this past year and seeing the film once again, gave me a better understanding what it was like on the day of the battle.

B0087IT8FK|5.0|At first I was a bit hesitant to view this movie because of the subject matter...big mistake!  So glad I watched and then later purchased this gem of a move.  It is wonderfully entertaining, funny, witty, charming, and serious as well.

B007N85POS|5.0|This is my 4 year old grandson's favorite game. So simple to use he does not need my help. I purchased this app to prevent the pop up ads which get him confused and off track in the game. Well worth the .99 cents. I let him play when I need to talk to someone without interruption. Nice!
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|great movie my son loves it. we watch it over and over. i will never tire of the Ice Age movies
B004SBX112|5.0|I purchased the ad free version because the free version has lots of pop up ads which confuse my grandson and interrupt the game. Angry birds is his favorite game and is so simple to use. He loves it!
0142501123|5.0|Julia Donaldson is so very clever.  My Grandaughter just loves her books  The graphics are splendid and the words when read out loud just roll off the tongue. Room on the Broom such a lovely tale.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|What can I say? It works great and has lots of alarm tones to choose from. Gets me where I need to be on time. I love it!
B006CHML4I|5.0|This is a great watch for an active person.  I needed a watch that was water proof (ok, resistant) and would actually stay that way.  I have ruined 3 timex watches because once the battery is changed, even by people who are certified and pressure test, my watches are never water resistant again.  This watch won't need a battery change and it isn't hard at all to keep charged.  Setting time, day, date, is easy.<br /><br />I really love the blue face, I am not one to wear a basic boring watch and the blue gives this a nice kick.  The band is a little scratchy on the outside, it doesn't slide well under sweaters with tight sleeves.  I just changed the band out for a nice blue one that I got from JCrew which is easier to get on and off (I need to wash my watch bands fairly often because I wear the watch in the barn = stinky) and it complements the color of the face very nicely.<br /><br />All in all it's a great watch.

B00E8KLWB4|4.0|its a fun game.l other then having to wait for your energy to restore, but I guess it lets you play a little longer then most games.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I like it so far as it is a new game for me. Time will tell. but so far so good.
0812971825|5.0|As soon as I finished this book, I immediately re-read it just to pick up and further &#34;digest&#34; the story. Initially I thought I would be put off by the main character, and idea of a &#34;tragedy&#34; that needs to be overcome, but I was immediately drawn into this very well written novel.

B006BFK5DK|5.0|It's always been a fascinating journey to see Earth Wind & Fire continue to redefine themselves musically as they continue to make music,comeback after comeback. It's so creative minded and refreshing to see this approach. I realize it's difficult for Philip Bailey,Ralph Johnson and Verdine White to keep going on stage and in the studio the way they do. With Maurice White now likely permanently absent,they are also confronting a whole group of music lovers who continually pit them up against the music of the 1970's funk era (of which they were a key contributor) up against what they are doing today. It's a ridiculous standard to be sure. Also if the layers of one's musical trepidation is peeled back,one glimpses that EWF have never in fact strayed from that standard. Not in the studio anyway. They've tried new approaches,some more successful than others. But Maurice's vision for them was so strong that Philip Bailey is still able to exude that unique mixture of coolness,spirituality and heavy duty groove power this band has always had. And no less than that occurs here.<br /><br />  The album opens with the percussively bumping and highly danceable funk of \\"Sign On\\",with it's earnest lyrical plea to basically \\"get up,get into it and get involved\\":the very core of their encouraging philosophical aestetic. \\"Love Is Law\\" is an equally uplifting lyric which accompanies a deeply grinding melodically crafted funk jam of the highest order. Three songs here deliver high octane dance-funk of different colors \\"My Promise\\" zeroes right in on the gospel inspired joy of the Phenix Horns' and the richly harmonized falsetto/mid-range vocals. \\"Dance Floor\\" pulls out the heavy funk with Verdine's classic grinding bass throwing down that ever important brink and mortar foundation. \\"Night Of My Life\\" adds a splash of rockier guitar to the occasion and a slight pop inclination. All of course are supremely funky from the bottom up though. The dynamic \\"Guiding Lights\\" and \\"Got To Be Love\\" are strong examples of the locked tight funk ballad style in the \\"Can't Hide Love\\" phase-a style they've always kept true to and expanded on strongly.<br /><br />  There are two instrumentals here. First is the light and breezy Brazillian jazz of \\"Belo Horizonte\\" and the other is the amazing \\"Splashes\\",a number that strongly emphasizes the bands early fusion jazz roots with Terence Blanchard's amazingly calling trumpet solo. Might very well be my personal favorite here. \\"The Rush\\" concludes the album with a shuffingly funk Kalimba led groove. With the more than welcomed re-visitation of keyboardist/producer Larry Dunn back into the fold-especially on his dynamic solo improvisation on \\"Splashes\\" is not the only draw for this album. In many ways this might qualify as EWF's most jazzy recording since their [[ASIN:B00000250L Head To The Sky]] days. And although this album isn't quite as intensely spirited as their previous date [[ASIN:B000B5QWK6 Illumination]],actually their strongest album in years,this is very close to that especially in that it doesn't rely so strongly on guests from the rap/hip-hop world as that album tended to. This finds a contemporary and mature EWF being themselves and relying only on the occasional guest instrumentalist such as Gerald Albright to enhance their sound. There's a strong band flavor here. And all the music is top-notch. Whatever some may thing,it's always great to know that Earth Wind & Fire are still alive and kicking. And I am personally very glad to have them back again.\\" are strong examples of the locked tight funk ballad style in the \\"Can't Hide Love\\" phase-a style they've always kept true to and expanded on strongly.<br /><br />  There are two instrumentals here.

B007WCJSWA|5.0|Mike Stern is one of the most prolific and creative composers out there and his guitar playing is a wonderful blend of deep jazz line building finesse and rootsy blues-rock.  A great CD laced with wonderful creative tangents from the likes of Esperanza Spaulding and Richard Bona just off the top of my head.<br /><br />Buy it!
B00DNDR29I|5.0|It actually took several listens to Janelle Monae's full length album debut[[ASIN:B002ZFQD0E The ArchAndroid]] to fully grasp it's musical virtues before even being able to review it in my head,lead alone here in black and white. That was several years ago. And the review I did do here only came after seeing her live in concert a year after that. It was a truly captivating experience: \\"united funk\\" all the way-meaningful grooves,messages and an enormous amount of involvement and communication with the audience. Strangely enough after that,a certain level of cynicism began to sink in on my part. Attitudes like...what if Monae's intense creativity was a gimmicky fluke? Would she become a generic artist pimping the pleasure principle like so many the next time,to sell more albums? And had the early 1990's style critical negativity gotten to me at last? How selfish of me. Here was the very fulfillment of the musical desires and imaginative ideas I'd had since adolescence manifesting itself before my eyes. Why reject that for the sake of psychically numb realism? When I heard earlier in the year her follow up was about to arrive,it was a summer of waiting with baited breath to here the musical fruits of her passions. With no hyperbole intended,I am astounded with what was heard!<br /><br />  Beginning with \\"Electric Overture\\", Suit IV a swirling blend of cinema and surf rock guitar we go into \\"Givin' Em What They Love\\"-a thudding and minimal funk-rocker featuring of course Prince himself. Having heard a version of \\"Q.U.E.E.N\\" during the summer,this Erykah Badu duet is a superbly realized Minneapolis style rhythm guitar/spicy boogie funk synthesizer. \\"Electric Lady\\" slows the groove right down to a crawl with this heavily texturized electronics bubbling up from an heavily reverbed drum and bass line-Monae and Solange Knowles's voice blending into perfect harmony. On \\"Primetime\\" Janelle and Miguel's male/female duet is set within the musical framework of another spare,lightly beat heavy (and therefore very funky) mid tempo ballad. \\"We're Only Rock 'N Roll\\" jumps right into a sleeker interpretation of the classic James Brown groove than on the previous albums \\"Tightrope\\"-as well as having a more melodically constructed song craft about it. \\"The Dance Apocalyptic\\" goes right for the heart of this uptempo Caribbean-type funk jaunt while \\"Look Into My Eyes\\" brings in the Spanish tinge with a sensually flamenco inflected tango.<br /><br />  Suit V begins with the beautifully cinematic orchestral 60's type next part of the \\"electric overture\\" before going into the early 70's Chicago soul inspired \\"It's Code\\" which,along with \\"Can't Live Without Your Love\\" and \\"Victory\\" bring out that \\"sweet funk\\" sound of that specific musical ethic. With it's theatrical blend of synthesizer bass and intense rhythm \\"Ghetto Woman\\" is complexly melodic electronic funk like you've never heard it before-asking for sympathy for it's character rather than the derision of society.\\"Sally Ride\\" is a tight,slowed down foot stomper of a jam that's full of honesty and a little attitude. \\"Dorothy Dandridge Eyes\\",with the equally talented Esperanza Spalding,is absolutely amazing-with it's thorough understanding of jazzy style keyboard textures and sensual,truth telling rhythms. Not to mention melodic and harmony suggestions that are alternately passionate and paranoid in the best heavy on easy sophistifunk fashion before ending the album with the slow and dynamic boogie funk of \\"What An Experience\\".<br /><br />  Many of the songs on this album feature interludes such as \\"Good Morning Midnight\\",\\"The Chrome Shoppe\\" and \\"Our Favorite Fugitive\\",narrated by DJ Crash Crash that illustrate this albums concept. Cindy Mayweather,the space faring  archandroid has arrived at the threshold of an apocalypse-with only a group of Mayweather clones called the Electric Ladies providing a degree of satisfaction. Is it another P-Funk like conceptual tract? Not at all. This album is full of many different variations of what actually turns out to be a very important message to the listener. In an environment where a culture itself is almost entirely ruled by fear of one thing or another without realizing it,the best way to live life is to be aware and gain knowledge. But also to be in a position where you can change things for the better. This theme isn't illustrated by mere preaching. There's a theatrical storyline just as with her first two releases,as well as a set of characters with their own situations. The stage was set,the players were in place for this album and Janelle Monae more than showed she could dance-literally and figuratively. She has affirmed her place as the much needed innovator of the funk/soul/jazz/R&B spectrum and did so by diving head long into the funky gumbo of Stevie Wonder,Prince,James Brown,Gil Scott Heron and Curtis Mayfield that she channels into her musical orbit. An amazing piece of music that,on many levels,words may not be able to adequately describe.f many different variations of what actually turns out to be a very important message to the listener.

B00006JKON|4.0|I really enjoy Jethro Tull, but I don't think this is one of the best albums, and part of me feels that the major reason I bought it is because I wanted to complete my Tull collection. Good, and I am pleased I have it, but I have better Tull albums.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|I love the bluntness of the main character [Charlie]. I heard so much about this book, I went on to read it and I've read it about 4 times since, then went out and bought the actual movie at target. I really can't compare it to much, but it got me through a few rough spots.

B00CC9P99E|5.0|I have been listening frequently to \\"Standards\\" since I received it directly from shop.lloydcole.com a couple of months ago.  It has some of Lloyd's best songwriting ever, and it's fantastic musically too.  If you've enjoyed Lloyd's music before, either with The Commotions or since going solo, \\"Standards\\" is a must-have.  Personally, I think it's his best album since \\"Don't Get Weird On Me, Babe\\".  Here's what the critics say (from lloydcole.com):<br /><br />What the critics are saying -<br /><br />\\"Cole has come up with what may be his best album\\" The Independent<br /><br />\\"A Masterstroke\\" The Mirror<br /><br />\\"Captivating\\" Mojo<br /><br />\\"Cole's elegant pop pontification is required listening\\" The Scotsman<br /><br />\\"Pop Gold\\" Scottish Daily Express<br /><br />\\"Gloriously, pertinently verbose\\" Record Collector<br /><br />\\"A timeless classic\\" Classic Pop Magazine
B00CTT9646|4.0|Did not find out ahead of time about the fact the phaser is a QmX Phaser. In fact I didn't realize it was from QmX until I opened the box. (My fault as I did not read the description...lol) I am content with it, they do nice quality pieces.<br /><br />From QmX:<br />\\"The hero props in the movie have a servo-powered spinner to change the intensity setting from \\"stun\\" to \\"kill\\"; our replica is spring-loaded with an active locking mechanism that snaps the spinner neatly in place.\\"<br /><br />Snapps... kind of but not really, it stops in Stun position but is loose in the Kill position, there is a magnet and detent in the Stun only. you must use your hand to swivel it from Stun To Kill. It is a Hero type prop with no electronic sound or action other then the manual swivel, the energy level dial is cast and does not move. The buttons are cast in place as well. It is a nice weight and looks well crafted. It comes with a nice display base for book shelf presentation, for me thats where it's going to go.<br /><br />it is not a toy at all!!!
B008CLI4N4|5.0|very condensed from the books  but it took all of the major points and you could follow the story lines.  I also liked the commentaries from some of the actors and writer of the book etc which were very eye opening and you get more of the background story.  Now on to the 2nd season
0307887448|4.0|This is review is for those people who, like me, don't care about the 80's.<br /><br />I don't dislike the 80's, I'm just indifferent to it. It's just another decade and I see no reason to get extra excited about things that existed then.<br /><br />It doesn't matter, not knowing all the references made little difference to the enjoyment of the book. Eventually, when the author would spew a list of names and references that I had never heard of I would read them as \\"mumble mumble\\". The one of two references I did understand gave me a slightly better picture of the scene, but the difference was slight.<br /><br />So if you don't care about the 80s don't let that stop you, it doesn't harm the book at all.<br /><br />Now a bit of a review:<br /><br />The story was exciting and fun. The message not so much. The obsession with the 80s struck me as one of the worst wastes of human potential I had ever seen and the story read as a cautionary tale. The lack of resources in the world could be directly attributed to how much time people were wasting on useless things - it's not like they actually enjoyed it (like most entertainment), they just wanted to be able to solve the puzzle, and worse they were doing it as their main activity, rather than on the side like a hobby or entertainment.<br /><br />The first chapter (0001, not the introduction 0000) was one of the worst chapters I have ever read (in any book) - I recommend people skip it and go directly to chapter 0002. The complete lack of realism and sanity it displays were astonishing and the author would have done better to leave out all his political and religious views and just stick to the story. Luckily he confines himself just to that chapter. (There's a small bit later with a completely unrealistic description of a nonsensical energy crisis. Or maybe it does make sense if people are spending all of their energy on a game.)<br /><br />Overall it's a great book and I recommend it. Just because the characters in the book are acting in a stupid way doesn't make the book (the story) itself bad.
0694013013|5.0|The book is loved by my kids and my daycare kids.  This was a gift for my daycare girl who loves reading it over and over!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This was a great read. A little heavy on the Microsoft/Apple debate but, that is one of the defining aspects of Jobs' legacy. I loved learning more about the man and his creative process. Very inspiring.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Seriously, if you enjoy music at all this is a must see. It is a very well done documentary involving people who truly love it themselves. It's sad that this studio had to close down, especially after all the amazing albums they put out. The album they made along with it is also phenomenal.
B004KRQFI0|5.0|Take one good listen of any song on this album and you'll know exactly what makes Skrillex one of the most revolutionary names in music!<br /><br />It takes an immense amount of effort to produce something this amazing, and Skrillex's meticulous attention to detail can be heard in every beat. One could only match the fantastic quality by strapping a dying cat to a broken washing machine running on full throttle.<br /><br />Featuring memorable and original lyrics such as \\"I\\", \\"am\\", and \\"Skrillex,\\" along with a neurotic screaming kid mixed in occasionally, this album offers not only catchy beats, but heart pumping passion and deep soul!<br /><br />Are you ready for a new century of music that will make your mouth gap in awe? Buy it today!
0988178532|5.0|Stop reading my review and start reading Outview...no seriously!<br /><br />This book will take you on a wild ride from beginning, and won't stop along the way.  Legg has taken parts of his personal life and interwoven them into a mystical tale of a young boy coming of age; except this boy's coming of age is very different than most of our real-life experience.<br /><br />Follow Nate on his learning experience as he tries to come to grips with his new found abilities and the task he has ahead of him.  Some would wish for the powers he possess, but would we want to responsibilities that come with those powers?<br /><br />Young adults will love delving into the world Legg has created.  As a not so young adult, I enjoyed the trip myself.  On to book 2 for me!
B001P5HI4A|5.0|I would recommend this product to high school people, college people all over the world!  There is alot of information missing from their lives that no one will teach them, tell them until they get OLD and gray and this is just not fair to them.  They should be taught alot of this info in Junior High School and even High school!  I missed out on alot of growing-up info that I wished I knew when I was 50 years old.  I could have even been more prepared for retirement and not just have to receive regular, state given SOCIAL SECURITY MONEY and no PENSION!!
B005LAIHSG|4.0|i liked the movie.  i wanted to see kristen stewart in a differant role.  she is a good actress.<br />it's not like snow white
B005ZOBNOI|3.0|Nice Read. Well written. More suited to a young adult audience. I enjoyed it although I am a more mature reader.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Cute way to kill some time here and there.  Yay for horses. Go team go. I love writing reviews so much.
B00ERP55NQ|1.0|It is hard to use and it does not show everything. I wanted to use to find ship wreaks but the feature was not there.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is my favorite TV Show.  It's a great show with good actors and good writers.<br />I can't wait for the newest season to begin.
044024630X|1.0|This is my second Reacher book and it will be my last. \\"A Wanted Man\\" was interesting, suspenseful and different, right from the start and all the way through to the end. \\"The Affair\\" is just idiotic! The actions are so implausible, the female lead character such a total male fantasy woman, the \\"bad guys\\" stereotypical, the dialog wooden, and the violence intolerable. As someone else posted, Reacher is judge, jury and executioner to four people in the story, killing with brutality, abandon and a smug superiority that is more chilling than anything else in Child's book. Puerile, offensive, but, apparently, profitable.
B008XG1X18|1.0|There are some good ideas on here, but I can never find what I am looking for.  Too much worthless stuff.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|I am not really sure why many have rated this film so highly. It really isn't that good, although the character is slightly better than tha Stallone rendition, I can see why this flopped at theaters. It was only good as a time waster.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Looking at the book from a very closed minded perspective; it is an intense science fiction story. However Ender's Game's messages cannot be looked away from. They give such different perspective on the world. Card exploits topics that need to be addressed but rarely are in society. He questions our society and the ethics of war and our world. Brilliant.
B00AC8ZJPQ|4.0|Forget Starship Troopers, which was terrible. (Although I loved Heinlein's book!) This movie was actually good. I was kind of expecting a cross between Starship (per the reviewer who stated as much), and something to do with the actual gaming experience. I am glad I watched it, because it was NEITHER of those things. However, I wish they had unmasked Master Chief- that would have been penultimate if M.C. was actually the mother of the main lead male cadet. Too much of a cliffhanger, but then again, if selling games or a sequel movie, then this was perfect......I wanted MORE!<br />It was that damn good, even after the slow start.<br />I am not a Halo nerd, although I am familiar with the genre. I am just rating this as a stand-alone scifi movie/thriller/shoot-em-up. Cliffhanger aside, I gave 4 stars for keeping my attention riveted, would have been 5 if the start wasn't as slow and they had actually unmasked Master Chief toward the end.
B00004T0P1|5.0|Loved this soundtrack so much, I ordered the DVD! Great sound and images of the Dinosaur clan moving from one area to a distant other. Definately a movie for kids and adults! Great price at Amazon too!
B005LAIGPU|5.0|Dane's first big movie. Watch this kid...he is going to be big. Movie is more for the younger crowd, however.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I like that it doesn't give you hints when you don't want them . I like to work it out for myself. And the layout is very clean.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|its all good except when I put in the charger it goes to the app and exits out your program
0062073478|5.0|At first there were ten and then there were none....<br /><br />There are some books that are timeless and never grow old.. And Then There Were None by Agatha Christie is one such book which though written some seventy years ago still has the power to shock the reader and leave him at a loss of words!!<br /><br />Ten ordinary people are invited, each by their supposed friends to spend a week on the famous and much discussed, Indian Island. Although these people seem ordinary, each has committed murder and got away with it!! Once on the island, they learn that their host is held back and wont be joining them. Cut off from the mainland, one by one they start dying all according to a nursery rhyme &#34;Ten Little Indians&#34;..<br />In a race against time, they have to find the murderer (who it seems is one of them) and also get off from the Island before any more deaths occur..<br /><br />&#34;One of us in this very room is in fact the murderer.&#34;<br />This book was first published by the name &#34;Ten Little Niggers&#34; which was then changed to And Then There Were None because of the racist nature of the first title. It also has the distinction of being the best selling mystery ever. Definitely the best work of Christie and supposedly her favorite too, it has everything namely suspense,mystery,tragedy,drama, psychological reasoning, emotionally packed scenes and also some bone chilling and nail biting moments.<br /><br />Agatha Christie spins a tale that is unusual and definitely never heard of before. The treatment of the story and its ending is entirely new. Every tool is used to heighten the tension, terror and suspense in the story.<br /><br />Each character plays his/her part to perfection whether it be Rogers with &#34;fright in his eyes, dry lips, twitching face&#34; or Vera Claythorne, who was &#34;frightened of the dark&#34;!!<br /><br />The description of the house on Indian Island is exquisite and very admirably done using comparison as the tool to heighten the drama.<br /><br />'If this had been an old house, with creaking wood, and dark shadows, and heavily panelled walls, there might have been an eerie feeling. But this house was the essence of modernity. There were no dark corners-no possible sliding panels- it was flooded with electric light, everything was new and bright and shining. There was nothing hidden in this house, nothing concealed. It had no atmosphere about it. Somehow, that was the most frightening thing of all.'<br /><br />The nursery rhyme, &#34;Ten Little Indians&#34; is expertly and very beautifully used in the book as a blueprint to the murders that happen. Its an ingenious plot that leaves the reader spell bound and speechless with no clue to what might happen next!<br /><br />&#34;I don't know. I don't know at all. And that's what's frightening the life out of me. To have no idea....&#34;<br /><br />“In the midst of life, we are in death.”<br /><br />All through we are shown the reasoning of the murderer but still I couldn't make out his identity till the very end and then also I was shocked because as it says in the book, the murderer was totally unexpected.<br /><br />&#34;Many homicidal lunatics are very quiet, unassuming people. Delightful fellows.&#34;<br /><br />A brilliantly designed and executed book with a plot that leaves its effect long after we have finished reading it. Its a once in a lifetime book. I have no words to explain everything that I am feeling after reading it but hope that my rating says it all.<br /><br />I give And Then There Were None a shining 5 on 5 and highly recommend that everyone read it. Books like this come once maybe in a century or more and are not to be missed at any cost.<br /><br />This review is also available on my blog Njkinny's World of Books & Stuffighten the drama.<br /><br />'If this had been an old house, with creaking wood, and dark shadows, and heavily panelled walls, there might have been an eerie feeling.

B000LTAY1U|4.0|Nice, simple, un-pretentious, and functional watch.  Reminds me of the green wind-up Timexes that we used to get through U.S. Army supply channels.
076790592X|5.0|As the cover rightly states, Tuesdays with Morrie is a book about an old man, a young man and life's greatest lesson.<br /><br />Morrie Schwartz was no super hero, no celebrity either rather he was a<br />\\"small man who takes small steps, as if a strong wind could, at any time, whisk him up into the clouds\\",  who had been a Professor when the author Mitch Albom was a student at the Brandeis University.<br />Then the question arises, what was it about him that made Mitch think that he was worth writing a book about?<br /><br />The answer to that question is that he didn't think any such thing. Morrie's only claim to fame had been an appearance on a show called Nightline and it was through this that Mitch came to know that his old professor whom he had not met for some twenty years was dying of ALS. It saddened Mitch and he decided to meet him. What was initially a reunion of an old professor and his student became a final lesson on life's complexities.<br /><br />I was touched by Morrie and his optimistic approach towards life. He was brave, lively, sensitive, compassionate and someone who knew how to break life's complexities into simple steps.<br />Morrie had been a grandparent, a teacher, a colleague, a friend. He had been someone who could listen patiently to all that you had to say without passing judgement. He made you see the world as a more profound place, and guided you whenever you faltered. \\"You\\" here being all his students especially Mitch and all the people who came to him. But most importantly he was someone who was dying and therefore had become more interesting to people.In his own words,<br /><br />\\"People see me as a bridge. I'm not as alive as I used to be, but I'm not yet dead. I'm sort of... in-between.\\"<br />\\"I'm on the last great journey here - and people want me to tell them what to pack.\\"<br /><br />His appearances on TV where his way of reaching out to people all over the world and giving them hope.<br />His mantra \\"When you learn how to die, you learn how to live.\\" was something that he wanted people to know. Morrie was a brave man, a compassionate man who knew the value of time and even in his last moments chose to make himself an example where others could see and take his lead to live fully even in the face of death like he was doing.<br /><br />Mitch and Morrie subsequently spent the next sixteen Tuesdays together exploring many of life's fundamental issues like Death, fear, aging, greed, marriage,family, forgiveness,society,a meaningful life. Morrie was giving his last lecture while Mitch was writing his final thesis. Even when dying Morrie was imparting his wisdom to people around him. He was truly \\"A Teacher to the Last\\".<br /><br />Mitch has captured Morrie's deteriorating condition, his courage and his zest to life in a simple yet captivating way. The reader feels myriad emotions while reading the book from happiness to acute sorrow, from evaluating one's own life to planning the future on Morrie's principles.<br />The scene that specially stuck with me was the one where Morrie tells Mitch about the place where he has planned to be buried and asks him to visit, telling him to make it a tuesday as they are \\"Tuesday people\\".<br />As for talking, he has a simple solution for Mitch<br /><br />\\"After I'm dead, you talk. And I'll listen.\\"<br /><br />The final class with Morrie changed Mitch and as he says<br />\\"I look back sometimes at the person I was before I rediscovered my old professor. I want to talk to that person. I want to tell him what to look out for, what mistakes to avoid. I want to tell him to be more open, to ignore the lure of advertised values, to pay attention when you loved ones are speaking, as if it were the last time you might hear them.\\"<br /><br />He also accepts that he cannot \\"undo\\" the past but one thing that he learned from his professor was that there is no such thing as \\"too late\\" in life. Morrie was changing until the day he said good bye!!<br />The book left me wiping my tears and left me with an acute sense loss and of re-evaluation of my life. The things that we take for granted like a normal day was something that had become just wishful thinking for someone like Morrie who could not even wriggle his toes at his will!<br /><br />Life is short, make the most of it.<br /><br />The book, Tuesdays with Morrie deserves a 5 out of 5 and Morrie is someone who will always remain in the memories of thousands of people to whom he gave hope and introduced them to a path of happiness and contentment. I respect him and hope his message reaches far and wide. Do read the book for Morrie's class is a success!!<br /><br />This review is also available at njkinny.blogspot.ing my tears and left me with an acute sense loss and of re-evaluation of my life.

1455508977|4.0|\\"How far would you travel to find love?\\" is the question asked on the cover and this was what made me pick this novel and I am so glad I did that !<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed reading The Lucky One which is a touching story of hope, belief, luck, love lost and found but most of all the secrets of the heart that guide us in our life.<br /><br />Logan Thibault has seen it all in his 4 or so years career as a Marine and, now that he is back from the war, is haunted by the deaths of his friends in the army and the horrors that they faced at the battlefield. Logan survived numerous close encounters with death and came to be claimed as lucky. His friend Victor, believed that a certain picture of a woman that he carried with him was his lucky charm and though he had never met her, it protected him from harm.<br />Now back safe, Logan resolves to find this mysterious woman and travels across the country in pursuit of her.<br /><br />Why does he feel the need to find this woman?<br />Does he owe her something as Victor said?<br />What happens when he does find her?<br />How will he explain the circumstances surrounding the picture?<br /><br />All these questions are what Logan has to find the answers to and also discover his destiny which he feels is somehow connected to this mysterious woman.<br /><br />The journey to find the woman in the picture , though he doesn't know it at the time, is one that will bring meaning to his life.<br /><br />The book is simple in style but written in an engaging manner. I was  hooked from the start and felt part of the story line. The tragedy of war, the injustice of life is effectively brought to life by Sparks and left me with tears in my eyes. The love that grows between Logan and Beth is shown beautifully via emotions and circumstances that bring them together. There's is a love that blossoms in the backdrop of menace, conspiracy and difficulties. Set in the humid North Carolina, there is everything to keep us interested with nail biting scenarios, unexpected turnouts to events and a humorous touch too to the story.<br /><br />All in all, a gripping page turner with an ending where I constantly feared that this could also be one of the books with unhappy endings. (I am not saying that the ending is unhappy or happy. You gotta read the book to find out ). After all you never know with Sparks, he thrives on the unconventional and has no qualms about killing his protagonists if he so wishes.<br /><br />The book was successfully made into a super hit movie by the same name<br />The Lucky One. :)<br /><br />I give the book, The Lucky One,  a 4.5 out of 5 and highly recommend it. Its a keeper which encourages us to believe and never fear the unknown. You never know..your destiny might be just round the corner!! :)<br /><br />This review also available on njkinny.blogspot.initing scenarios, unexpected turnouts to events and a humorous touch too to the story.<br /><br />All in all, a gripping page turner with an ending where I constantly feared that this could also be one of the books with unhappy endings.

B00AZMFJYA|4.0|we liked the movie it was not as fun, funny as the last one but was glad to see all the characters were on there even the old spock made a show again. They included a couple of old star trek movies updated in the new timeline.<br />Was disappointed that Netflix actually sent this faster then our pre-order on Amazon.
1781162646|5.0|Joyland is a joyride for readers.  Think of an amusement park where young kids work at summer jobs as carnies. This North Carolina park is a place where sometimes scary and creepy things happen when you least expect it.<br />I think Stephen put most everything in this one. You name it - Joyland has it -a ghost, sexy girls, a killer (a serial killer at that), love gone awry and a young boy trying to figure out life as well as other interesting characters.  Stephen must meet a lot of interesting people because he sure knows how to write about them. As always, getting to sit beside Stephen is a good ride. I also like it that this paperback book was reasonably priced. Thanks Stephen!<br /><br />Jeannie Walker Award Winning Author - \\"Fighting the Devil\\" - A True Story of Consuming Passion, Deadly Poison, and Murder
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Following the WoT has been a great read. So sad it is done. Mr Jordan would be proud of you, Brandon Sanderson, for completing his series. I still wish there was more.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It doesn't have the functionality that other streamers have in terms of the variety of supported application but for $35 + tax you get a nice compact device that can play netflix, Google Play (online movie rental/buy service, similar to iTunes), Google Chrome and youtube. The 'cast is also an open platform so they say the final word is far from being said here, and there's a lot more to come.<br />There is no remote or some on screen interface. The device is controlled via mobile devices or pc/laptop using the chromecast mobile app. I have the app on my iphone and Nexus 7 (android). Integration with the devices is OK but can be improved in terms of interface however playback for Netflix and Google Play was flawless for me.<br /><br />Setup is super easy and simple. You basically don't need to type in almost any information other than naming you device (optional but useful if you have more than one). Just plug it in, and let the app on you phone/device set up itself. Note however that the chromcast turns off when not in use so you have to turn on your tv and switch to the chromecast to wake it up so you can set it up (say on another device).<br /><br />I hope this device will support other apps in the future, like Amazon for example. But for now I'm extremely happy for the price I paid.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Is a very stimulating game. Love how it keeps mymind always expecting the next move. Great. You'll have a wonderful time.
B00E6D4HHO|4.0|Honestly the only issue I have with the item is the collection itself. I truly wish that they would have waited until after Days of Futures Past comes out and included it in the collection.
B008JFUO4U|4.0|This film's special effects are amazing. The story plot twists the mind as the action is not disappointing. A good sci-fi film of the summer.
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|Tennis in your face is tons of fun to play. I have lots of fun playing this game. I would recommend to anyone...
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|Great film that keeps you guessing to the end with its twists and turns. The special effects alone is worth watching this one! Visually stunning, great acting, riving plot a must see!
0547884591|3.0|This book is beautiful and there's some good tips.  But Tim's style in this particular book seems more geared toward his fans, mostly men under 30, rather than the general public - which is absolutely fine.  After all, you just need 1,000 fans, right?  I'm a woman who is not in his age demographic, and just read 4 Hour Work Week for the first time.  I can say that it's probably THE MOST influential book I can remember reading, because it was motivational, and I learned some things in it I'd never heard of before that have already improved my husband's and my life.  I almost always borrow books from the library first, to try it out, which is what I recommend for everyone.  I'm definitely buying the 4HWW to refer back to.  But the 4HC is going back to the library.  It's just too big/heavy, too scattered, too \\"look at me\\", too much of things I could care less about, personally and would never refer back.<br /><br />Summary: I really like Tim's energetic,positive personality and I follow his blog.  Each of his books are different, but the Chef book is probably the most confusing because we are all used to one main focus in each book.  If you're a Tim devotee you should definitely buy it, but he already told you that.  (P.S. Happy Day of Remembrance to all)
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Have been impressed by this gadget.  Works fast and doesn't stream as some others do.  Clear and simple instructions to follow for an easy setup .
B003VANOFY|5.0|You can hear the unheard song backgrounds and also extremely clear voice chat.<br />It is an amazing headset.<br />I highly recommend it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I have been looking forward to seeing this at home. It was delivered today, the day of the release. So, no complaints about delivery. However, when I put the Blu-ray disk in my PS3 player it doesn't play. After what seems like the Internet connection the screen seems to freeze with a black screen, and that's it. I'm not sure why this happens. The regular DVD disk does play, however, but, of course, all the special features are on the Blu-ray disk. If anyone knows what to do to fix this, please let me know. Until then, I would have to say I'm disappointed.<br /><br />Update: After trying several things and researching on the Internet, I eventually tried cleaning the disk, and voila! it works fine now. I suppose I should have tried that first, but I thought coming right out of the package it should be alright. So, now I change my 1 star to a 5 stars. Life is good once again! :)
B005SV9X22|5.0|Yes I like Lady Gaga but that wasn't the reason I gave it a five star. The beginning of the show was a bit slow but it picked up very well. She really entertains not just with music but with an on stage performance. She even got me interested in the songs I didn’t care too much for. The imagination behind each performance was just brilliant. It was so good I want to see her live on her next tour.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|It's clear and concise.  It repeats things and puts things in an orderly fashion.  I felt his suggestions were true and good and I believe I will recommend it to friends.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was skillfully written and very emotional and you will have many conflicting emotions. The characters were very well developed. VERY good read but very sad.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great alarm love the different types of setting different tones and being able to wake up to my music is the greatest love it
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|Absolutely fantastic! That is all that needs to be said! If you don't know now you know! Buy it or be boring.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|couldn't even figure out how to get into the game. I took it off my apps don't like this at all
B00CHRBANK|5.0|Just a good fun album. I rarely purchase new albums in vinyl but I bought this one specifically for the purpose of playing at a party. Just positive fun uplifting music with a good beat. Also good for doing chores. : )
B008469DGY|4.0|I LIKE IT! Fun but do not like lack of progression other than going to the next hole for shots at holes in one. Wish it were at least half course.
0811879542|5.0|My 11-year old daughter brought this home from the school library two days ago and we haven't stopped playing with it. She's read it to everyone in the family and even my parents. The best is when she reads it to her 4-year old sister. Listening to them clap and giggle has been wonderful. I wish there was a kindle app. They'd play it for hours if I'd let them.
006114665X|5.0|Gave very good information on the personalities, and general screw ups that led up to a great slaughter. It was as if they were all looking for war, surprisingly Germany not so much, but that's what I gathered. Other than fact they thought unless they struck first, they might loose superiority to the Russians. Which no one really had to worry about militarily.
0307279189|5.0|Not only is this an incredible story of a practically undiscovered tribe of super athletes, but the book is chock-full of interesting characters and information. I found myself Googling just about every character in the book. I enjoyed learning about the history of ultra marathoners, and the evolution of man into a long distance running machine. The Leadville Race kept me rapt with attention. The aspects of the Tahramura were magical. And finally, I think this book captures the spirit of running: pure joy. I slapped on my sneakers and ran thirteen miles after finishing it, my longest run ever.
B008Y7IP0S|5.0|I liked this movie when it first came out and had owned it on VHS.  When I saw Amazon had it in HD I just had to watch it again, and it was almost like watching it for the first time, but much better video detail with surround sound.  I also like the music.
B0058UXHHK|5.0|At first, I wasn't sure I was going to like this book. Rose seemed like such a wimp, never standing up for herself. As another reader put it, she seemed weak. That was a necessary part of her character, however, or the story wouldn't have unfolded as it did. The author has created characters that the reader can easily care about and identify with. The story has some predictable moments but, none the less, is exciting enough to keep me up late into the night reading. I bought the second book before I read this one because the premise was intriguing. I can't wait to start it. I think mystery/romance fans will love this book. There is even a little paranormal thrown in but it is not overwhelming. I hope you enjoy meeting Rose as much as I did.
0439023513|3.0|I will admit that I did not particularly care for The Hunger Games. The story, itself, was amazing, but I didn't like the fact it was written in the first person. There were things I needed to see that I was unable to, due to the fact that Katniss was not present. Not one to give up, I read Catching Fire and absolutely loved it. In fact, if I didn't know better, I'd swear they were written by different authors altogether. I had been given some spoilers, some warnings about Mockingjay, but I decided to read it for myself. Can't say I enjoyed it. It's not an enjoyable story. It's a sad, tragic story that never, ever gets happier. Katniss does not have one enjoyable, hopeful moment in this entire book. It was a let-down for me, the ending completely un-satisfying. I don't for a moment accept the relationship between Katniss and Peeta, and I don't for moment accept the fate of Gale. I feel a little cheated, to tell you the truth.
B000NYT1M6|5.0|This is by far one of my sons favorite toys. He plays with it all the time! It was a good decision to buy.
B00ET7EON4|5.0|I am a big Arctic Monkeys fan - I over played both of their first two albums, \\"Favorite Worst Nightmare\\" and \\"I am whoever you say I am\\" to death.  Then, unfortunately, I did not enjoy either of the next two album \\"Humbug\\" and \\"Suck it and See\\", too much vocal reverb and soft singy songy lyrics that had no bite.  \\"AM\\" brings them back to me, back to the great guitar riffs, heart pounding drums and witty creative lyrics. There are hints of the last two albums, but overall, they are back. This album is a joy to listen too.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|My family plays this together and we have a fun time sharing our gifts.  We all enjoy it very much.  Thanks for making this so much fun!
0143124544|5.0|This novel is funny, poignant, and smartly written. I didn't want it to end because I wanted to continue to spend time with these two characters in this special world that was created by their friendship. Read it!
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Tried it out a couple times. It was fun to play, but without hints got annoying fast. Hints would make this game better.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love this app, it does just what it says and more. Accurate weather forecasts even for the small island in the Caribbean where I live. The forecast for today was rain and we got rain. Many thanks to the developers!
B008JJM88Q|1.0|Requires an Internet connection at all times. Was interested in seeing if it was as good as 20 questions. I only like games that are not as Wi-Fi dependent.
B00447G2PM|2.0|For a giant screen (IMAX) production it is a very disappointing that the image quality on all underwater shots is well below the old worned out VHS tape! Severe geometric distortions and colour aberrations aroud peripheral parts of the screen cause eye strain. As the camera pans on all wide angle shots (most of the film) the distortions makes the viewers dizzy.<br />It seems clear that, despite high cost and recording format of this production, the underwater optics (flat port) compromised the end result to less than standard definition quality, which is not what viewers are expecting from an IMAX film.<br />Like other viewers, I find the story pretty dumb, aimed at 5-year olds. It's a shame because the underwater world offers some of the most amazing and captiviting stories that audiences would love to hear.
B00992CF6W|5.0|These hotdogs are amazing but minecraft is even better this is the best app ever<br />If you don't have this app you are not cool<br />It is not cool to not have this app
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|This was a great read. It had a lot of twists and turns. I found myself routing for the least likely of characters and the most appalling behaviors. I am going to look for more books by this author. I like the way she writes.
B007SYWFRM|2.0|it dose not fit my kindle fire without extra &#34;stuff&#34;.  Don't know what to do with it.  It's just setting there
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book is full of characters, that are alive and vibrant they draw you in to the book making you apart of the scene. It is a very good read.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Nice puzzles with several options available.  Additional puzzles are available for purchase; however, there are many puzzles available at no cost.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun game passes time. Kids seem to like it. Could teach some responsibility and how to care for a pet
B00992CF6W|5.0|I have minecraft on my computer it is super fun but so is this game u don't have to kill sheep just use the shears there should be a limit on how far away another person is to play i love to play this game i have a three story house and a backyard that i keep my sheep in this game is worth every other penny
B00000251N|5.0|I used to play the album to death, and one day just recently saw the CD in a collection of Neil Diamond's works and it all flooded back. I loved the movie and I love listening to the soundtrack. It's has such a soothing effect. Some folks might not like the repetitive nature of all the compositions sounding like a variation on the theme, but I find solace in the simplicity! ^&#60;&#62;^ I have just been drawn to the whole work and loved the book, too!
B008DM4OTA|4.0|great game. wish there were a few more healings to be performed because she got bored after awhile.<br />Otherwise it was a fun game.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good game. But have ads that pop up. And if you do not have Wi-Fi on tablet you can't play.
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|this is a great racing sym app. very well executed, the controls and races are customizable. graphics are great! get it!
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|Minion Rush is a wonderful idea for a running game. The Despicable Me minions are excellent and the environment is interesting and detailed. Sadly the execution has gone from bad to worse.<br /><br />The game runs slowly on my Asus TF700T, and this should not be. The graphics, while nice, are not as crisp or vibrant as those used in Temple Run 2, for example.<br />In fact, after the latest update the speed was so low that the game was unplayable. OTOH, Temple Run 2 is slick, fast and beautiful; everything that Minion Rush could and should be.<br /><br />The cost model is also more expensive. When I looked at the price of the coins/gems the cost/quantity worked out similar between the games. However, in Minion Rush to carry on a game costs 20 coins, while in TR2 it has a climbing scale, 1, 2, 4 etc. so you can carry on easier at the lower levels and is therefore cheaper, at least at the beginning. Also, the gems are much more common in-game in TR 2 than the coins are in Minion Rush.<br /><br />I've uninstalled and will give the developers of TR 2 my money.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I love the clock format that gives weather by hour, and especially the doplar radar view. A friend said that an app he uses shows lightening strikes. This might be a nice future addition to this app.
B00004TH7Z|4.0|I had to buy the disk.  There are no mp3 available for this album.  You can't go wrong with Maiden
B0036G8IQS|5.0|Loved it. Would recommend it to any young or old avid reader! Especially if the reader enjoyed the Harry Potter series.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|The game keeps me very entertained!  I enjoy games that require you to use your brain which this game does!
B001I9B9I4|5.0|It seemed normal & natural, not pretentious. It was a beautiful love story. It was the way I would like for the first family to act.
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|It's like Tron in terms of beauty, but the story is much better indeed. Beautiful, Rich, Intriguing with great performances from some talented actors.
B0059XTUXQ|1.0|Not happy that I can't load the digital copy. Perhaps it should be mentioned prior to shipping to Canada that the digital copy can be loaded to U.S. iTunes accounts only (that info is not available until you open it). The dvd also says that it expires in April, 2013 and I bought it in August, 2013. Again, a little piece of info that would have been nice to know. If I just wanted the dvd without digital copy, I would have bought it in Canada for much less.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|If you like someone repeating everyone of your words, or thoughts. How about a talking animated character doing it. Why not. Why not fill the quiet times with, an animated talking fat alley walking, lack of dignity, cat. What could be more fun out on a date, along the water front, or on the beach, or out in the field hunting Wild Turkey, Raccoon, or Bear hunting. If you like someone telling you what to do, why not Talking Tom Cat Free. Oh, and it will, most of the time, have a pop up for another app.
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|Let me just start by sayin I don't care to be on FB!But the 1 thing I do like about FB is some of the games! So I was so happy to find a game that I always enjoyed playing on FB.So I got the App!Played for a bit waited for my crops to grow went back and had to start all over! Got going again and this time nothing would post to FB!Things have been working great up til now! went to play a bit ago and its not even my farm!!!!!!!I really want to keep playing BUT the problems are starting to tick me off!!!!Wish I could have given it 5 stars!

B007MB5OCE|5.0|The 100-year-old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared is a wonderful book -- funny, often touching, and a crazy ride of a read!!  The story starts out with a 100 year old man escaping from a nursing home -- on his 100th birthday.  And that is the beginning of a fantastic journey that intertwines seamlessly with his 100 year long life.  Of course it didn't happen -- but, oh, how you wish it were all true and that the stories would never end.<br /><br /> I am now reading this for the second time around -- and am enjoying it as much, if not more, than the first time.<br /><br />I'll be watching for this author's next novel - and his unique way of celebrating life.

B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it. A sweet love story pleasantly mixed with the right amount of kink. Definitely added to my list of favorites.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|The DVDs are very high quality and the price was very reasonable. The whole family enjoys watching them. It's was a great purchase experience!
B00CY0JY88|5.0|I really liked the story line to this. Something I would read more of if she released more soon. :)]
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I love this series! It's been years since I watched it, but I thoroughly enjoyed it all over again!! Highly recommend buying it!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Every since I had this game, I have played almost every day I am hooked on it. I have other bingo games, but this is my favorite.
1401324649|5.0|The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared is a delight to read! The book traverses back and forth between the present day of Allan Karlsson (the 100-Year-Old-Man) and his adventures over the course of his fascinating and amusing life.<br /><br />After reading the first two chapters, I found myself ever anxious to read more. Jonas Jonasson is a masterful storyteller. More than once I laughed out loud at the hilarity of the store. And the vivid portrayals of the various characters who converge are a delight to read. This is one of those rare books that builds upon itself, weaving a gripping and quirky series of tales that culminate in a brilliant climax.<br /><br />I cannot wait for Jonasson's next English-language book to come out.
B0012GMVDK|5.0|One of his more interesting CD's.  This one was used as soundtrack in a movie... and those are usually better picks.
B0091REZMW|4.0|This game reminds me of a game that I played 29 years ago on pc. I love it!this game is also child friendly,so I don't have to worry about what they might see or hear unlike some other games.
B0016492BW|5.0|If you have had a bad day and need a good laugh, this is the move for you.  Get it now for your collection.
B007N6ZH5M|5.0|A difficult subject put across in a simple to understand way. The author has kept to the basics and without claiming to be an expert really given some in-depth insights on  emerging markets and what he believes the future holds without sounding like a fortune teller. At times the book does get a little repetitive towards the end but the benefit of it is that it will help novices like me gain a better understanding. I would highly recommend this book to any one who wants to understand the financial and economic dynamics around the world without needing to get into any technical aspects. Well done Ruchir!!
B002VECM72|5.0|This is a good and heart warnng story of love, trust and acceptance.  This should be in everyones movie collection.

B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Movie was well made but the story was straightforward It is worth a watch not for the suspense/thrill but for the special effects and the topography
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|My three year old son LOVES this movie from start to finish. I cannot tell you how many times he has watched this movie...even I know most of the words!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|That my 5yr old granddaughter loves this game she even loaded it on her grandpa tablet and taught him how to play it and she is good she will play this game every day if her mom would let her.
B0091XRPTQ|5.0|Every child needs to see this movie. My three year old is now obsessed with the Polar Express. Our family enjoys this movie.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Its fun to play that's all I can say I play it with my granddaughter and she wins everytime because my arm gets tired
B009AY04A8|3.0|Pirate Adventures is not a bad game but it's not great either. It's a pretty simple game with a very shallow story line in which you find objects among several pictures. It also has various other puzzles of the likes. It's a good time killer but nothing really all that special. If you are a die hard fan of hidden objects game feel free to buy it. If not I&#34;m sure there are better alternatives out there. It is a good time killer though.

B001152TL6|1.0|This is why David Lynch should always work alone and have unbridled resources and great unknown actors! Because when he doesnt this kind of trash happens. Sorry to see this garbage come from my favorite crafter of surreal quasi occult and paranormal artist of visual media. It does have its moments though... When tye main character receives a call from his house and the being in front of him it is engaging. Too short for Lynch to shine, its waters were too muddied by name brand actors whos fame allowed them a place to showcase their wooden performances. Save yourself some time and buy Inland Empire instead and watch it twice... Youll be twice as happy<br /> then if you watch this movie.
B0014NDXGA|3.0|This is my second golf laser rangefinder and I can honestly say this one is much easier to use than the first (some generic model I got cheap).  The rangefinder is nice and compact, plus the Pinseeker technology works as advertised.  Here's the catch...after owning this product for just a few weeks, I noticed that there is a stain in the viewfinder.  It's not on the outside, because I have cleaned all the lenses and it is still there.  It doesn't affect the way the rangefinder works, but it is distracting.  This is where the 2 stars comes in.  I sent email to Bushnell support about the problem.  Their response is to have me send the item to them for &#34;evaluation&#34; (no guarantee of repair or replacement) for 4-6 weeks.  In addition, I have to send a check for $10 to cover return shipping!!  Unfortunately, I have several important tournaments during the next few weeks and don't want to be without a rangefinder.
B002ECQQZU|1.0|Heard the stories about people walking out during this movie. Well I just turned it off. This movie is not worth your time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can not wait for the movie to come out in November. It is going to be AWESOME
B000001EHS|5.0|Since I Tunes doesn't carry them. I bought the CD and put it on my i phone and computer. It has all the hits I listened to growing up and this is one of the best 80's rock bands ever.
B002NXOQF2|5.0|Although this was recommended reading when I was MUCH younger, at 60 years old and an avid reader, this book held my attention from beginning to end.  Always a treat for me when a book is written in a way that I feel like a fly on the wall and can easily visualize the place and overhear the conversations.
B00B2JSRAS|1.0|This book really is for those who believe in UFO and non sense. This book was just a bunch of ideas stolen from the secret and other books.<br /><br />I want a refund. None of the exercises worked. It all failed miserably
B00868AF9O|5.0|This book should be read by EVERYONE.  Excellent.  A true fell good all over book.  Lessons to be learned.  Situations to be simplified.  Love and kindness to be recognized and shared.  Little things in life with so much meaning.<br /><br />I purchased my book through the Cambridge Glen Bookstore via Amazon Books.  They were efficient and fast in the process of the sale.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I love her writing! She makes you feel involved and keeps you on the edge of your seat! I now plan on reading more of her books!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm on the last book and could read many more.  The story is gripping and is hard to put down to get anything else done.  I will be reading everything else that Hugh Howey has done.
1416972250|5.0|I am hooked.  Ordering the next installments to this series.  Vamps, magic, my kind of fantasy.<br />This is right up there with Kenyon, and Hamilton.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|The Notebook is the type of story that makes you believe in love and commitment in the sense of it being unconditional.  Time is gift and a curse for Noah and Ally but they endure several obstacles to be with one another.  The movie is predictable but not in the way that one would expect.  So if you're wondering if the two wind up living happily ever after I will offer you this, they do wind up together although it is not the life you expect.  It is a must see.  I have to read the book since the movie was so well done.
1781162646|5.0|\\"A merry heart makes a cheerful countenance,<br />But by sorrow of the heart the spirit is broken.\\" -- Proverbs 15:13 (NKJV)<br /><br />I know many Stephen King fans, and I'm fascinated by his writing methods and style. Yet I find his books hard to take due to the ghastliness involved in many of them. Consequently, I don't read many. I'm glad that I made Joyland an exception. It's a superb book with only the tiniest aspects of what normally repels me (and obviously attracts many others).<br /><br />Characterizing this story according to genres is a challenge. It's clearly an homage to the carney world. There's a murder mystery. It's also a coming-of-age novel. And, of course, there's a non-Biblical supernatural element. Ultimately, the book is perhaps best understood as being gracious and full of charm, upholding the idea of doing the right thing. If that's the kind of uplifting book that appeals to you, consider Joyland. The book is written from a male perspective in every sense, so don't expect the kind of cosiness that a book with a woman's perspective often brings.<br /><br />Mr. King does a great job of adding many appealing, and unforgettable characters, the kind that you might like to have as friends, coworkers, and neighbors. I can't remember many novels of this length that succeed so well in this regard. Excellent!<br /><br />Perhaps the best thing to say for capturing this book is that while many of Mr. King's books start from fragments of a nightmare he has had, perhaps this one story started with a daydream while sitting under a pleasant apple tree as summer retreated into fall.<br /><br />Nice going, Mr. King.
B00004TH83|5.0|You feel every word that she sings! A magnificent talent; she can sing in any language.  I'm loving this cd!!!

1451624468|2.0|I was very much looking forward to a book about cosmology and physics and I got it in part. I learned a few new things, but not a lot. The book is certainly easy to read and I blew through the first half in under a day, but I think this was very poorly done. The book starts a bit with a brief history of cosmology. It was really condensed and wouldn't help anyone who wasn't already familiar with the history. There are other books that do a much better job of this. The rest of the book became a bit of a mess.<br /><br />I have two major issues with the book. Firstly, there are too many editorial comments about creationism and intelligent design. The author is clearly an atheist as am I, but I didn't really want a book about why creationism is stupid; I already know that. The other problem I had was that the author constantly inserts himself into the story unnecessarily. I get the impression that rather than trying to tell the story behind dark energy, he is trying to write the history and take as much credit as possible.<br /><br />I have about 3 more chapters left to read and based on the other reviews here, there is very little of scientific interest here, so I doubt I will put in the effort to finish it.
0525478817|5.0|Life is not fair; it never has been.  It never will be.  But life is what you make of it.  It is what you do with it.<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is about Hazel who has cancer.  She will never be cured; her life will just be prolonged.  Her life changes when she meets Gus, a cancer survivor.  Gus is full of life and reenergizes Hazel.<br /><br />Hazel's favorite book is An Imperial Affliction, and Gus comes to love it too.  The book's only flaw is it ends in mid-sentences.  Who would end a book like that?  Together Gus and Hazel seek out the author to discover the real ending.<br /><br />What I loved:<br />* John Green does not sugar coat long-term suffering.  His details are sometimes too overwhelming.<br />* Long-term suffering and friends.  Green pegged people's reactions to illness.  Most people disappear; most people cannot handle being the friend of a \\"sick person.\\"  Those that matter stick with you to the end.<br />* The caregiver.  When people think about terminal very rarely do they think of the caregiver.  Is their whole life taking care of the ill, or is it something more?  Will they have a life after the ill is better/gone?<br />* Gus.  He is a hilarious character full of life.  I can picture him driving in an abrupt stop-and-go manner with his prosthetic leg.<br />* Van Houten.  He was a sad pathetic man.  Green does not sugar coat his pathetic state.  In fact I wavered between anger and pity.<br />* Hazel.  I loved that she found life and the inner strength to go on.<br />* John Green's accurate portrayal of characters.  I laughed.  I cried.  I lived through them.<br />* Hope/support.  Though I long to be independent, I know that we cannot live life alone; we need each to survive.  I was happy that Hazel and Gus found each other to lean on.<br /><br />What I questioned:<br />* Eternal hope.  Though I depend on other people to help me through tough times, no one can replace my God.  The comfort and trust I have in Him is nothing to compared to human comfort.  \\"38 For I am convinced that neither death nor life, neither angels nor demons,[k] neither the present nor the future, nor any powers, 39 neither height nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God that is in Christ Jesus our Lord\\" (Romans 8: 38-39).
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|I've always felt that Sheryl's work has always had elements of country and pure Americana sound that was given a final coat of pop.<br />Sheryl has spent quite a bit of time hanging with country greats and was inspired to give us a full country album.  Sheryl moved to Nashville in 2006 following a breast cancer diagnosis and explained in an interview that as just a singer/songwriters she felt that there may not be room for her type of artistry in mainstream pop anymore, and that country music would be a natural fit for her.<br />Im impressed and expect to see this album make some waves for her! Glad she's back!!  I may add more to this review when I have finally picked a standout or fave but for now its an overall good effort.  Try \\"Easy\\" for now.  It's a feel-good type of track like \\"Soak up the sun\\" was but with a stripped country feel.

0451419243|3.0|Fall of the giants (my review [1]) was simply marvelous.  Mr. Follett lays out the pressure points, the rivalries and the treaties to clearly enunciate why World War I occurred.  The characters are lush and the prose poetic.  In short, an excellent book.  I was expecting nothing less from Mr. Follett with the second book in the series.  Needless to say, the book is disappointing.<br /><br />Why?  Well, a couple of reasons.  The prose here is prosaic and the characters that we grew to know so well in the first novel are still here, but marginalized by their offsprings.  The latter would not be a cause for concern, but the descendants of the Fitzherberts, Williams, Peshkovs, Dewars, and von Ulrichs are not given the time to develop fully.  The children of the parents are quickly assigned to their rote roles and I am afraid to say that not all of them rise above the fray.  Of all the children, the one that strikes a chord is Carla von Ulrich.  Besides Carla's, I did not find the trajectories of the lives of the children as exciting and invigorating as the adults were in the first book.  The adults in this book are relegated to their required roles: Grigori remains a good Bolsehvik amidst a rotting core, Woody becomes a prominent senator, Ethel morphs into a parliamentarian and Fitz remains, well, an earl.<br /><br />The prose in the book is mediocre; unlike the beautifully crafted sentences in the first book we get punctuated abbreviations here.  Somehow, the writer's craftsmanship does not show.  Maybe Mr. Follett was in a hurry to finish his book, I do not know.  But the result is that you are left wanting more.  There are places in this book where Mr. Follett's penmanship starts to assert itself, but soon enough it is lost in the aforementioned punctuated abbreviations.<br /><br />Unlike the first book, this book does not provide a historical context for the conflict.  Perhaps Mr. Follett is assuming that most of his readers will have a reasonable amount of contextual information for the rise of the Third Reich.  But as good a writer that he is, this could have been dramatized more than the pedantic \\"brownshirt\\" scuffles that percolated through the early part of the book.  That said, the description of the Russian army invading Berlin and the aftermath was poignant.  Of course, this must be understood in the context of Germany's invasion of Stalingrad.  But that was not covered in sufficient detail in the book to warrant a comparison.<br /><br />In the end, I think that the book is worth a read.  Although I suspect that Mr. Follett is capable of producing a much better book than he has delivered. (July 2013)<br /><br />[1] http://www.amazon.com/review/RFR9IU3UKEIU9/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|Okay, I'm gonna get slammed for honking my own horn here, but it seems like I just wrote a book about something along these lines a few months ago. The first time I caught this one, it was at the fifteen-minute mark. The second time was from the beginning, and it was hard to believe I was watching a docudrama. Then again, I did know all about Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, but wasn't Barack Osama claiming he was closing all that stuff down? Of course, Obama Bin Laden does warrant an exception...but that may be what The Standard and Zero Dark Thirty have in common.<br /><br />The flick itself is a quality piece of work. Maya (Jessica Chastain) is a CIA agent reluctantly transferred to the Middle East after 9/11, and she is paired with expert CIA torturer Dan (Jason Clarke) to find out who knocked our lights out at the WTC. It doesn't take long for Dan to get burnt out on the job, but Maya starts following some quality leads and soon gets a laser focus on Bin Laden himself. Despite frustrating nay-saying and spineless vacillation from CIA chief Joseph Bradley (Kyle Chandler), she finally runs the ball straight to the White House where Bin Laden's namesake gives the Navy SEALs the go-ahead to plant Global Enemy Number One six feet under. You got to give Chandler a lot of credit here. Nailing both King Kong and UBL onscreen in the same decade is no mean feat.<br /><br />I suppose the soliloquy here would be about how much is too much as far as human rights goes. In The Standard, you've got Jack Gawain hacking baddies to pieces to get information in foiling a mini-nuke terrorist strike in the USA. In Zero Dark Thirty, Dan restricts himself to near-drowning the perps, ninety-six hours of sleep deprivation, and shoving them in cubicles slightly bigger than a breadbox. I mean, don't we have some kind of drugs that get these jobs done? We're all aware that sodium pentatol doesn't work well on super-geniuses like Hannibal Lecter, but that flick's almost two decades old. Street dealers have improved their products by quantum leaps in comparison. Plus we question making an exception for baddies, UBL or not. Now the Psycho Sheik's gone, who do make the next exception for? The top guy in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan or Mexico? When will it be okay for us to zap the top drug dealer here in KC? A few healthy doses of electroshock can save a lot of lives, y'know...well, you get the picture.<br /><br />Speaking of getting the picture, Zero Dark Thirty joins Argo and Life of Pi as three of the best picks of the year. Like Jarhead and The Hurt Locker, they won't be the kind of flick you'll watch a dozen times, but they sure as heck are worth the Amazon price for a popcorn Saturday night.alers have improved their products by quantum leaps in comparison.

B00BSBUZPK|5.0|Very interesting to get the &#34;real scoop&#34; from ALL of the bandmembers as to how they came to be, why those that left the band did, how they found &#34;the replacements, etc. LOVED seeing the old footage of Linda Ronstadt, James Taylor, Jackson Browne. Very cool DVD!
B00DB624GS|5.0|This review is up to date with the 2013 Deluxe Edition release.<br /><br />This is one of my all-time favorite rock albums.  I remember hearing it the first time around 1974 when I talked my parents into buying my first stereo receiver from Radio Shack (model made by Pioneer at the time) for Christmas.  They couldn't afford (nor could I at the time) speakers but I bought some headphones.  In the early days of FM radio, it was mostly free-format and they often would play entire sides of, or entire LPs on the radio, with FEW commercials.  I used to listen to the headphones often when I went to bed at night and listen to FM until I fell asleep.  One night late, they played this whole LP. I was floored by it.<br /><br />This LP provides a snapshot of the entire spectrum of rock and roll at the time (OK not psychedelia, nor Blue Cheer-y, though).  It goes from hard to soft, blues to rock, and some folk here and there.  Peter Green and Danny Kirwan were the best and most melodic & pretty call and response team in the business.  They really show it on this first truly whole LP by the band.  Before this, their LPs were collections of singles.  They show their roots & hearts and the playing is magnificent.  They also show what a great band they would have continued to have been with this lineup, had it survived.  Oh Well.<br /><br />Everyone who owned the original LP and original CD release knows how awful it sounded.  The LP had the most tape hiss of just about any LP ever released.  It was hard to listen to at high volumes, especially in the quieter passages.  Still sounded better than the original CD release, though.  It was self-produced by the band; too bad they didn't hook up with some better technology or equipment.<br /><br />So now here we are in 2013 and out of the blue comes a remastered \\"Deluxe Edition\\" release, which is actually the original British LP song cycle (better than the U.S. which differed except included \\"Oh Well\\") plus bonus tracks.  That's a bit of a stretch to call it \\"Deluxe\\" when just a few bonus tracks are added, but oh well.  What we get now is the best sound ever heard by these ears of this LP, with the best track running order, and it just shines.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are Oh Well (Pts. 1 & 2), The Green Manalishi (later covered by Judas Priest and others), and World In Harmony (a beautiful duet between Peter & Danny).<br /><br />They've filtered out most of the tape hiss and the instruments and mix can be heard very well.  Beautiful playing and melodies abound, and it really can be appreciated more, now.  Oh Well can now can be listened to without cringing on the tape hiss and distortion.  With the essay in the new booklet, we now know that Peter Green actually played a DOBRO on the track!  Whodathunk?<br /><br />If you have any appreciation for the original lineup of Fleetwood Mac, want an introduction, or just a general rock fan of the period, this is essential listening.<br /><br />I say this Deluxe Edition, with the much-improved sound, the original British LP song list with the bonus tracks, is essential to any serious rock collection.<br /><br />Good liner notes which tell the story of the days of the recording of this LP.<br /><br />My only gripe is for a true Deluxe Edition, they should have included (or have an additional release) which includes a DVD-Audio with a 24-bit/96 kHz stereo mix.  Or, include an entire concert from the Boston Tea Party concert recordings (or other if available).  THAT would have been nice.  But this is still the most definitive version ever released up to now.<br /><br />Enjoy!a stretch to call it \\"Deluxe\\" when just a few bonus tracks are added, but oh well.

B00DNDR29I|5.0|\\"The Electric Lady\\" is truly a story. A continuation of a story...one that should not end for  a long time to come. This album strikes emotion, thought, and spirituality. Who else, but Janelle Monae and the Wondaland Art Society can perfectly infuse messages of hope, overcoming pain, and love? I can name few in today's music scene. To fully understand this great work, one would have to listen from track 1 through track 19. Listen without the intent to \\"jam\\" on every song. Each song is individual and independent of the song that comes before and after. And yet, all are needed together to get the full story.<br /><br />Janelle did an interview stating she is \\"possibly OCD and controlling...I thought I had to become a person who could handle everything\\"...with this cd, I feel she let go and let the mood of Wondaland lead her.<br /><br />Simply put, \\"The Electric Lady\\" a phenomenal artwork. A timeless classic.<br /><br />One day, we will all appreciate Jane.
B00A2H9OZS|5.0|Running time approx.(2hrs)High Definition Pic and Sound. A Stunning come back and return of Riddick. This movie picks up were the last movie finished; however they still leave you with more questions than answers. This movie is hardcore and cut throat from start to finish. Once again Riddick finds himself abandoned on some unknown desolate barren planet were he must utilize all of his cunning might and true survivalist skills to escape this horrible planet filled with stunning and dangerous creatures. I'm amazed by the consistency and attention to detail Riddick producers seem to get right every time. They know how to take you to another place and time, and create stunning futuristic (sci-fi) fantasy worlds that will put you in awe.  My compliments to both writers and producers for accomplishing this.  All acting, props, sets, wardrobes and effects were to (A-list) standard, and monies well spent. This movie is very impressive and there are (no) dry-boring areas; its action all the way through. However, it's not surprising that producers left this epic series open for a (4th) installment in the near future. Thank you.
B009FAQ9JW|4.0|Marlon Brando did a good job on this movie early in his acting career. The movie has a love story hidden in it.

B003K1EYM6|5.0|I just got a iPad and hated the thought that I would have to lug it around to,take pics so I could post them to FB. Then I saw this adaptor kit. Sooooooo easy to use! Worth the low price! Love it!!!
B00ET7ICEQ|2.0|I've liked some of Sheryl Crow's Music in the past, however, if this is the direction her career is  taking, she's moving to the mundane.  This could be any one of a dozen nameless female country singers.  Nothing special.  It is is exactly the kind of music that makes country one of my least liked types of music, just slightly above rap.  Boring, sappy, uninspired music.  Next she'll do a duet with Scotty McCreary.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|I am really shocked at how people underrate this movie! Because of their mindless reviews I missed the opportunity to watch this masterpiece in a movie theater - I read their \\"reviews\\" and decided this movie is not really worth my time and money. HUGE MISTAKE!!!! Watched it FIVE TIMES already and will watch again! And for some people: if you just not able to comprehend something - don't reduce us to your level...
1400069807|5.0|I found the content to be sound and based on journalistic premise.  Sometimes such books are not grounded in research (whether scientific, journalistic, etc) but instead are prone to fear mongering.  Easy read, enjoyable and enlightening.

B00AECDDYY|5.0|This is pretty cool game for anyone who enjoys strategic games. It wold be nice if players can play together online,too. For now, it is only possible to play against the computer
B001HNE3NO|5.0|While reading Sarah's Key, it was hard to go on with errands and chores. I wanted to keep reading and when I wasn't reading, I was constantly wondering what would happen next and how I would feel if I was in Sarah's shoes.<br /><br />My grandfather was a Holocaust survivor and this book gives even more perspective to what other victims had gone through. While reading Sarah's Key I appreciated how fortunate I am to experience the small joys in life and that is why I love this book so much. I believe this book really does honor those Holocaust victims in the fact that it helps educate and keep this part of history told.
B004XWLN20|3.0|when I received this - last disc of season 5 was glued into the case,,, so it isn't able to play,,, how do I get a new one?
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Bought Season 2 on Amazon;could'nt wait for it to come On Demand! Everytime i take a break from the episodes can't wait to get back to it
B00846REIS|4.0|At first it may seem like you are reading a copy cat of fifty shades but once you get past that you will see that it's completely different. The storyline will keep you wanting more.
B00DSTBMMU|5.0|Feels Like Home, the highly anticipated new album from Sheryl Crow, is this year's Album Of The Year!!! Sheryl Crow brings classic back to country!!!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this. Its very helpful to a forgetful person like me. You can set an alarm up for any time. You have so many options of ring tones and you can choose your own music. It has a stop watch too. You can make it any of your favorite shades.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|I watched this movie with my 10 and 3 year old daughters and love it.  I like the fact that the message is to be yourself and follow your heart.  I am always telling my girls that girls can do anything boys can do and it was nice to see that reiterated in this movie.  Reminds me of Grease mixed with Beach Blanket Bingo and extremely kid friendly.  Though the characters are a couple, they don't even kiss in this movie.  It's a nice pure relationship and sets a great example.<br />Definitely a must have if you have kids.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|I like the story lines that continue throughout the series . The law issues seem to be accurate. The guest stars are a hoot and I find myself wanting to see them more.
1455526959|3.0|The book was farfetched but it did help me to understand how much investigation and work it takes sometimes to solve a crime plus his boss wasn't at all helpful. How it all came together at the end was unrealistic.
B000PC1JKS|5.0|Should have had this in my collection long before now. Only listen to about 5 on a regular basis. The transition from the end of #2 to the beginning to #3 is a momement unto itself.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm happy that there will be another book in this series! I can't wait to read it. I like both lead characters and the supporting ones just as much. I found that I liked that the female lead wasnt some sacrificial lamb that gets de-flowered by the lead male. Eva is a wounded victim trying to recover with the equally wounded gideon. Its more realistic in my opinion.
B00004XPPB|4.0|Interesting movie that I was a little disappointed in overall.  But not disappointed in the quality of the video which was fine.  I received the movie about a week after I bought it.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|It is a fantastic book that teaches you about yourself, and others.  I have learned more about myself, and how to love me which in turn will aid me in my relationships.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This movie is about the funniest animated movie I have ever seen. Definitely not just for kids! My husband and I enjoy it too, great for everyone in the family.
B00CTT9646|5.0|As a lifelong fan I was happy to see the series re-booted. Abrams and crew did a great job keeping the franchise alive and relevant nearly 50 years after the original episodes aired. A lot of people complain about changes, and don't give the film a chance. There are great gems hidden for fans of the franchise, and the film is action packed and a first time viewer can enjoy as well.
B000W10AEI|4.0|As with the rest of the series it kept you in suspense and very much on Harry's side in his adventures through the myriad of minor adventures within the plot. This is an excellent series and well orth procuring for young and old.
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|It's one of the most frequently played CD at my home. I like it very much. It's a pity we missed his show in summer.
B00C2IL7SC|4.0|I think Robert Downey Jr. did an excellent job in portraying Sherlock Holmes in this movie. It was full of suspense and action and kept you on the edge of your seat during the length of the film. Well done.
B000002UY5|5.0|I've loved this cd since it first came out and I haven't heard it in a while. It sounds as good as I remember.
0143117564|1.0|Where was the plot?  Where was the suspense?  If u wanted a history lesson of how much drugs and sex happened in the era he writes about, go right ahead.  Just terrible.  Completely wasted a portion of my life because I can't stop reading what I started.  No true developing story at all!!!
B005FISBTO|5.0|I've read reviews about the previews having spoilers.  I have not had that problem. I received season six within a week of ordering great quality no complaints!
B009KS4XRO|1.0|I Can not find a way to get into the Bingo game.  Any icon in site gets me back to opening.  Slots payout are pitiful.  Looks like  freebie is NO bargain.

B0081KZ20E|4.0|Very methodical old-fashioned buildup but it turned into a ripping read with a great twist at the end. More dated than early Le Carre.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|I love Star Trek and have been watching since the Original series started back in the 60's (yes I am that old). I just did not find the new Khan as believable as the original Khan from &#34;Space Seed&#34; in the Original Series and &#34;Star Trek II&#34;. Maybe no one will ever make as good a Khan as Recardo Monteldbon (spelling suspect). I know he is no longer with us but they could have found someone who at least looked a little like him. Other than that I thought the movie was fantastic and I anxiously await the next installment.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|enjoyed the movie, had me on the edge of my seat. just the right touch of suspense excellent plot and ending
B007THA4FI|4.0|The character development was great. The people in this book were unhappy but very real. The small town politics were well developed.
B0011NVCSO|5.0|I had only heard Skinny Love by Bon Iver before I bought this album and, I was not dissapointed. Buy it, you won't be sorry.
B00ESZZOCM|4.0|An interesting movie that deserves a special spot in sci-fi history. This movie was a little ahead of its time. This movie was little like A L I E N and a little like RED PLANET. It looks like it was filmed on the set of OUTLAND and A L I E N. Played out with an all star cast Farrah Faucet, Kirk Douglas and the unstoppable Harvey Keitel. There are movies of this time period with much bigger budgets that really didn't even come close to this nostalgic gem. The story was very simple and could drag but in the context of the decade it was filmed it was an &#34;okay&#34; film. I own this on Prime streaming and look forward to watching it on Blu-Ray. This movie is worth $10.00 on DVD and $15.00 on Blu-Ray and I wouldn't spend much more but with the combo pack maybe $18.00. In any case rent it first and enjoy the thriller and suspense of it all. Enjoy.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Very easy show to get involved with the characters are so multi-dimensional. There is a surprising amount of action in each episode. I highly recommend this series.
1452000247|5.0|This book was an enjoyable read. Characters were likeable and the story had good flow. It keeps you on the edge of your seat wanting to see what is coming next. This author knows how to weave a story. I loved this book and highly recommend it all people.

B00BE97ONM|5.0|I loved reading this psychological thriller. Ben, the lead character, was in a dark place and I felt the author described his anguish perfectly. The troubles in his head led him to do crazy things, which made for an exciting read.<br />The other characters were interesting in their own way, notably Natalie, the devious girlfriend, and the plot was twisted but not over the top, so it's a thumbs up from me.
B0053O89IS|5.0|I love this series and the Seventh Season is one I have been waiting to purchase. Amazon had it for a great price and  I received it in perfect condition. Both my husband and I enjoy watching Bones together for the great humor and character relationships.  It makes you laugh, cry, get angry and be grossed out all in one episode.  To top it off the new serial killer is the most diabolical and devious villain ever.  AMAZING!
B006BFK5DK|4.0|Whether you've been a fan of EWF since the early-70s, or are a part of the new generation of fans, you have grown to appreciate their unparalleled instrumentation and uplifting lyrics.  It's been a few years since we last heard from them, but truly good music takes a while to create.  That is indeed the case with Now, Then & Forever.<br /><br />The album kicks off, appropriately enough, with \\"Sign On\\".  While it lacks the urgency of say, \\"System Of Survival\\", the message of being actively involved in the social and political events that affect your life is loud and clear.<br /><br />The album then settles into the mid-tempo groove of \\"Love Is Law\\", where those trademark EWF horns punctuate gospel-tinged vocal harmonies, led by the incomparable Philip Bailey.  The amazing thing about Bailey's vocal gift is that it actually seems to be growing stronger as the years go by.<br /><br />As for \\"My Promise\\", the horns step to the front and drive the song from start to finish.  The vocals punch on through just fine though, and this track reminds me a lot of the \\"I Am\\" album from 1979.  Heavy on the pop, but an unmistakable foundation of funk anchors it all.  Speaking of which, check out \\"Dance Floor\\".  Think of it as \\"Boogie Wonderland:  The Sequel\\".<br /><br />\\"Guiding Lights\\" has a smooth jazz feel, with keyboard master Larry Dunn leading the way.  The laid-back groove intertwines with words of positivity that recall previous EWF years:  \\"So keep your head to the sky / And let the clouds tell you why.\\"<br /><br />As for me, my favorites are actually the instrumentals, which include \\"Belo Horizonte\\" and \\"Splashes\\".  Both have a Latin style, with the latter featuring a REALLY cool flugelhorn solo.  If you remember the South American influence on the albums \\"All 'n All\\" and \\"Faces\\", then you will certainly enjoy these tracks.<br /><br />Let's face it . . . it is simply impossible to be in anything but a good mood when you hear the sounds of Earth, Wind & Fire.  Their music has been a solid rock of hope and healing for many, many years.  Several years from now when music historians look back, the contributions of EWF will be fondly remembered.as been a solid rock of hope and healing for many, many years.

1250030951|5.0|Where do you start when you love a book so much you want to live in it? That's how I felt at 1:30am when I finished Fangirl. Rainbow Rowell has a way with words and dialogue that paints a vivid picture of her characters. They seem so real to me. I really felt Cath's worry for her father, who suffers from mental illness. I really felt Cath's conflicted feelings about her changing relationship with her sister and the anxiety of figuring out simple things as a college freshman, and how even small things can be really scary. I really felt Cath's passion for a book series that was much more than just a book to her. Since Cath was so real, the people that came into her life seemed real to me, as well. That wonderful way of making the characters come alive was contrasted against passages from the Simon Snow book and from Cath's fanfiction, which was an essential part of who she was. I really loved the way that the book passages and fanfic was used within the story to set the tone and give you a window into Cath's love for those books.<br /><br />The thing about Cath is that she is happy with her life, her fanfic, her sister, and she doesn't understand why things have to change. There was just so much about those feelings that I related to, and it doesn't just apply to the college years. The thing that sets this book apart is how change is presented in the story. Things do change, yes, but I can't say that Cath changes. I think it's more that Cath opens up and lets in new experiences and people without losing the things that make her so very Cath. Rainbow Rowell navigated some pretty complicated family dynamics in this story and she did it so beautifully and artfully that I fell in love with everyone in this book. Everyone is talking about Levi, and let me make this clear, he has been put on the list of incredibly awesome book guys, but I think the person I loved even more was Reagan. She was part mentor, part fool. When I say fool I mean that she was able to deliver some truths to Cath, but in a way that was blunt, hilarious, and palatable. We all need a friend who will be there to tell you to get over yourself, but who will also back you up when you need support. I also found Cath's relationship with her sister to be interesting and very well done. I loved how Cath was able to become her own person but with the acknowledgement that she and her sister would always, always be there for each other even when things got bumpy. I'm really just babbling now and I think I've pretty much used my quota of the term \\"I loved\\", so let me just say that if you read this book you wont regret it. If you read this book, you will love it, you really will. If I win the lottery, I am buying thousands of copies and handing it out on college campuses until they kick me out for being the creepy book lady. That's how much I love Fangirl.ruths to Cath, but in a way that was blunt, hilarious, and palatable.

If I win the lottery, I am buying thousands of copies and handing it out on college campuses until they kick me out for being the creepy book lady. That's how much I love Fangirl.
B00CTT9646|5.0|I'm going to skip the movie review and concentrate on why you bought this expensive set - the Phaser! It is really cool. The quality is really good and the detail is great. It is heavy and could be used in a re-enactment costume without hesitation. I have it sitting on my desk in the display stand that it comes with and can't help playing with it. Worth the money in my opinion!
B00DH4BL8Q|4.0|I fully enjoyed this book and felt satisfied at the end. The only thing that could have made it better if the spinoff/sidebooks(son of sobek, and side demigod books) had been put with it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Must be one of the best books ever written! I could not put this book down, I even cried a little at the end
B00EAH3EQG|5.0|For her sophomore album, Natalia Kills turned towards a more introspective, personal series of songs, and as a result, we are left with an album which needs more than just a first listen to understand it.<br />Perfectionist, Kills's debut, showed the world that she was a radio-ready pop singer, but with Trouble, Kills elevates this title to unique, self-aware pop artist. Perfectionist had a pretty consistent set of good songs driven by electronic beats and synthesizers, but it seemed to be missing a sense of individualism and sensitivity. With Trouble, Natalia Kills brings an incredibly amount of these two elements. She reveals emotion honestly and provides us a window into her world. Her lyrics have become far more grown up and meaningful, with some of them almost shockingly honest.<br />With regard to the musical aspect of the album, it is far less electronically driven and more inclined towards a rock-pop sound. The songs are driven primarily by drums and guitars, with some other percussion and/or keys showing up occasionally, as on \\"Saturday Night,\\" the second single from the album. Some people have said the music isn't as catchy as that on Perfectionist, but I would argue that it is just as catchy, though maybe not upon first listen.<br />The other big difference with this album is Natalia's voice, which sounds far deeper and heavier than it did on her debut album. I personally think this lends more power to her voice and to the music, and this part of her voice balances well with the complex arrangements.<br />Track-by-Track:<br />\\"Television\\"- A strong electro song with an AMAZING spoken intro with a strong musical background. Somewhat like Perfectionist, but a little more heavy sounding. Standout. (5/5)<br />\\"Problem\\"- Obviously a great song. It's not strongest lyrically, but it is incredibly catchy and well-orchestrated. (4.5/5)<br />\\"Stop Me\\"- A fast-paced song about running away and being wild. Catchy and well-done. (4/5)<br />\\"Boys Don't Cry\\"- Driven byguitars and claps, this song recalls a somewhat retro sound (80s?), but with a very modern twist. (4/5)<br />\\"Daddy's Girl\\"- This song stands out to me. Relates her feelings of love towards her father, despite having lost everything he gained for their family. Great song. (5/5)<br />\\"Saturday Night\\"- Still one of my favorites, released as the second single from the album. The lyrics are heartbreaking, and Natalia's deep voice lends a greater sense of emotion to the song. (5/5)<br />\\"Devil's Don't Fly\\"- A song that Natalia stated is about her suicidal thoughts at seventeen. Once again, very emotional and clear in its message. (4.5/5)<br />\\"Outta Time\\"- Released as a free single on iTunes, this song is very simply done, which lends it its uniqueness. (4/5)<br />\\"Controversy\\"- The buzz single from this album... deals with the influence of media on humanity. Very heavily driven by the bass, this song is not the best but is an interesting listen. (4/5)<br />\\"Rabbit Hole\\"- A song Kills previewed a long time ago live. Once again not the best, but still a catchy song. Like \\"Controversy,\\" heavily driven by bass. Very reminiscent of Gwen Stefani's \\"Hollaback Girl.\\" (4/5)<br />\\"Watching You\\"- Written about Natalia stalking her ex-boyfriend, this song doesn't stand out initially, but after a few listens, I have been \\"converted\\" to this tune. (4.5/5)<br />\\"Marlboro Lights\\"- Another song about suicidal thoughts, this song, driven by the piano, floats in the air and displays a very vulnerable Natalia. (5/5)<br />\\"Trouble\\"- This song is already one of my favorites. Between the dramatic music and the deathly beautiful lyrics, this song screams with emotion. An incredible step forward for Natalia and a real standout from all her songs. (so incredible it's not worth even rating)<br />Overall, this album is a really incredible one (DEFINITELY no sophomore slump), and I would recommend at least giving it a listen, because it is truly fantastic.
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|I could live with the picture quality (even though there is grain, and lots of it), but the quality of the audio almost makes this DVD unwatchable. It sounds really bad. This is a big slap in the face to fans who have waited all this time to buy this DVD/Blu-Ray. I hope they start offering replacement copies fast.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This app has all the features that are needed in an alarm clock. Perfect for traveling. I am very satisfied with this app.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This story grabs hold of you and doesn't let go!  I look forward to other books written by Kathleen Grissom.
B00BN3DPQ4|3.0|I grew up watching the films Arnold Schqarzenneger made and I enjoyed almost all of them.  This one is just okay.  While there is good action to be had, Arnold's part in the film seems a bit disjointed.  On one hand he wants to be the action hero of the film (which is awkward given his age), and the other he is like a mentor to the other characters, which I think works well.<br /><br />The premise of the film is also unbelievable and plot holes abound.  It's a good popcorn flick, but not one of the man's best.  I look forward to checking out his future projects.
B004SUDQE0|3.0|This movie is funny but campy.  I think only certain people will get it's humor.  The preacher reminded me of a relative so I enjoyed that character a lot.  It is just silly fun, good for a night when there's nothing to watch on TV.
1612185495|4.0|If you are collecting James Bond novels like I am, I would say this is one to skip.  Watch the Dr. No film instead.  While some details are changed, overall the movie is a much better execution of the novel's concepts.
B00BWLKTOS|4.0|This CD is a lot more mellow than their first CD which was amazing.  I hope their 3rd CD is more like the first.
B005LFQRTC|5.0|The show needs no introduction to fans.  The packaging is superb, balancing small size with great function.  My Dad and I were both really pleased with this purchase.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This CD is super fun.  Such a variety of music from upbeat to melodic, really interesting arrangements.  It is better than Piano Guys 2.  I am hoping PG 3 will be more like this CD.  My favorites are tracks 2 & 7.
B00B1EEKM8|4.0|The quality of the blu-ray was excellent and the film is just as good as I remembered from my childhood.  I didn't care too much for later films in the series, so I've been waiting for a chance to get just the first film.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|Action scenes an the characters were excellent and still funny kept your interest also saw the sequel.  Would see it again.,
B009KS4XRO|5.0|AWESOME bingo game. Really enjoy the collection items they keep the game interesting and worth working towards.<br />I haven't played any other bingo games after this one.
B00000JNO1|3.0|Without being cruel, the album title says it all. After the first 2 albums, it was always going to be something of an uphill battle to keep the momentum rolling. The curse of constant touring, rushed contract and album negotiations will do it to even the greatest rock bands (yes, AC/DC, Led Zeppelin, Rolling Stones, Queen, The Who - all have dipped at one point or another) but still one the fans will keep listening to.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|Violent, single-minded, no-nonsense, heartless (almost).  Judgment:  guilty; Sentence:  death.<br /><br />I first encountered Judge Dredd in the 80's.  If you have ever read a Judge Dredd comic from the early days this film is very close.  Not for the faint of heart.<br /><br />If you put yourself in the world of Mega-City One you can enjoy this movie.  If you try to relate it to your world or sense of justice, you won't.<br /><br />A great film it is not; a great Judge Dredd it is.
B00CL0J99K|1.0|If you have never read the comic and only care about RDJ making jokes, this is the movie for you.  If you like a good story and actually care about Iron Man, avoid this movie at all costs.  This movie ignores its predecessors and throws every thing that made Tony Stark such a great character out the window.  Being one of the biggest fans of Iron Man, Iron Man 2, and The Avengers, I wish this movie had never been released. I try to be general  so if you still want to see this movie, at least I didn't list any spoilers.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|I paid extra for a version of this movie that includes the digital copy, so my daughter could play it on her iPod. The package says it will play on iPod or iPad or iPhone. It will not. I followed the directions and redeemed the digital copy. It started to play once in my iTunes on my computer, but will NOT allow me to load it to her iPod, which is synced to my computer. I can't compress it or do anything to the file to make it iPod compatible, and now the digital movie won't even play on my computer! Nor will iTunes allow me to re-download it to repair it. This is theft. I understand piracy, because I'm an author, but this is ridiculous. I can't even get what I paid for. I don't own a BlueRay, but paying for this version was--so I thought--the only way to get the digital copy for iPod. I am returning this as soon as the replacement arrives, because this was a birthday gift. Make the digital copy work, or don't charge for it at all!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Bingo Blitz can be very addictive, so beware!  There are options for in app purchasing, but there is plenty to do without spending a dime.  Just be careful with children.  It is also a great way to socialize with other players all over the world.  Generally great people, and the app censors inappropriate language.  Be aware that people who want to be rude will find ways around the auto censors.<br />All in all a fun diversion.  Reminds me of the times I went with my grandmother to the bingo hall, just cheaper!
0374531269|5.0|My son (age 13) had to read an autobiography from a non US author.  He selected this book.  We both read it.  The story is captivating, gruesome and sad to hear the accounts of Ishmael's childhood.  But I am glad I got to read it.  It's so hard to believe how &#34;safe&#34; we are in the US and there are children out there who are fighting to live like Ishmael did.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I am currently in the process of slowly replacing my DVD library to BluRay (better late than never, eh?)...I christened said trilogy with one of my backyard movie nights.....a roaring success, undoubtedly!!
B00ATPVA78|5.0|I Love mystery games, and this is one that exceeds my expectations! Plus, I can get hints throughout the game. It's easy but yet challenging. I'd give it 5 stars:)<br />If you like mystery games, you will want this one.
0679746048|4.0|Halfway through it and it is great. Very real and understandable. Its like insanity was brought into a better understanding by stepping into this girls shoes and watching the show.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Nothing flimsy about this watch. Well made , accurate, and nice looking but practical. Will never have to buy another watch battery!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Fun fun, what more can I say, it's the best bingo game out there and I've tried several. Keys for treasure boxes, power ups, instant wins and that are always adding new rooms
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so much fun. the husband and I love it. kids can't wait to try it out. I'm being stingy with it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|AMAZING!!! I just love this book. I can't wait to read the next one. I wonder what will happen to Thomas.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you've read the second the darkness, terror, yearning for a light at the end of the tunnel continues to the end. I couldn't put it down. If you skipped the middle book because middle of trilogies are usually a space filler. SUPRISE. The capitol and rebels are more sick and twisted then you could have dreamed and you didn't get to ease into it like the rest of us. Go back and read it if you want but I think you've got the picture. It was tied in wonderfully to mockingjay without give me a boring recap of something I read yesterday.
B00DJ735KI|4.0|I read a lot of books on this belief thing and they are pretty much the same, that isn't wrong but just show's more than one person believes in this and I think it is a very good book for anyone to read if they want to do some changing in their life, however, change take's time so one time reading isn't going to do it.
B00BJ9VBLI|1.0|What is up with this??? Once you complete several levels, you cannot continue unless you PURCHASE the 'rest of the levels'. It was entertaining while it lasted, but there was nothing noted in the app download, that stated, uh, you can only play a few levels then you have to pay! I believe that is deceptive! Will be deleting this app to free up space.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Star Trek Into Darkness was movie I was expecting a lot from. This movie spectacular, it lived up to everything I hoped for.
0321344758|5.0|It's a great book for those who are introducing in web usability. Easy to read and understand. I highly recommend this book for designers & developers.

B008BQ8VOC|5.0|Can't wait to see what happens next. Started watching the series last week and I've caught up to season 3 already!
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|This was a Exciting re-imaging of the Khan back story. The action, effects, humor and pace were all well done. I still prefer the first Star Trek 2: Wrath of Khan but this was a a really good movie.
B0057UAE54|5.0|This album was the bull in the china shop of all live albums. These songs still reach back over the expanse of time and get your memories flowing.....
B00EDF43MY|5.0|My daughter loves this app.  It really holds her attention unlike many others. I like how it has actual countries in it so she is learning something new.
B009AY04A8|5.0|This is a fun game and is very addictive. Has kept me up many of nights. Caution: Will cause insomnia.
B002BWP49C|5.0|Great DVD in the series.  I think this is the best of all the 5 DVDs since Bella gets married, have a child and dies in this one - more action than in any of the others.  She really seems to go through a lot in this DVD.  My favorite out of the series.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|A fully engaging game. Nice graphics. Fun to play and challenging at the same time. Looking forward to other games as well.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Neat graphics...nice story line...my new guilty pleasure!  The different types of puzzles keep it different all the time.  I can't wait to see what happens next.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|Reds II came out, but my husband and I decided we needed to watch #1 before seeing it.  It was well worth the price.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love my Marware Case for my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34;.  I already had a red one but it was wearing out so I chose the purple one<br />this time.  I will buy more in the future.<br />Betty
B003G4W49C|5.0|When I read the blurb, I thought not another 'the government says there is too many kids in the family' story.  The book was terrific.  Better than the movie.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I really like it but it keeps taking away my  coins that I have earned...and can't figure out why...so frustrating when I get like 7000 then my next round I lost all but 1000
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|This game has become an obsession with me and I don't get into any kind of games!  Can't put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome and most of the time I get addicted this game rocks I highly recommend it.deitrich out
B001NAT05W|3.0|Sadly this version was not as good as many of the other superhero movies. I felt the big problem was the story lacking excitement, and suspense.It does not measure up to other superhero movies. I blame the story more than the actors.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|I love this collection.  Susan Boyle has a master's voice and intonality.  I'm so glad she was finally discovered and everyone can enjoy her marvelous voice.
B0035WTJFW|4.0|Good film raising important questions about an unknown future.Can actions be forecast and judged before they even occur?Since the actions have not taken place, what if the projections are wrong, then innocent people will be convicted of crimes they,will never commit.Compelling question which the film tries too deal with.
1401324649|5.0|I was so sorry that this book had to end.  It was absolutely hilarious and unpredictable. Now one of my favorite books.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Enjoyed catching up with Christian et.al. tremendously in the Freed episode.  Felt at a loss when the story ended. Would appreciate one more episode in the series immensely.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Mr. Abrams can do no wrong in my book.  The second Star Trek for JJ and it just get's better.  I have the good fortune of having a home theater with a 3d projector and 7.1 dolby surround.  My neighbors are still pounding on the walls I'm sure wanting to come over and view it with me.  The sound is glass shattering and the big 3d picture is off the wall.  Really it comes right at you.  The new cast now in their second feature is outstanding and I hope more are planned.  Now for my headline &#34;Cumberbatch for Batman&#34;.  Benedict Cumberbatch is more than excellent.  He has the looks, the voice and an excellent villainy made me stand up and yell &#34;HE SHOULD BE THE NEXT BATMAN&#34;, not Mr Affleck.  I must say the Ben Affleck did an excellent job with ARGO and was perfect as George Reeves in HOLLYWOOD LAND.  I recommend both films.  But &#34;Batman&#34;??? what are they thinking? Let me know if you agree.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled takes us once again to Afghanistan. We learn about the Afghani culture in Khaled's books. The book begins with an Afghani fable. We are dropped into the life of a young country girl Pari. She has a deep love for her brother Abdullah. She is torn from him and her family and becomes the daughter of a woman that her uncle works for. She doesn't remember quite what happened when she gets older, but she senses that she was adopted. The book goes on to tell us of Kabul and of characters loosely woven into the lives of Pari and Abdullah and the family that she became a part of. The end was the best part for me, when the story came around full circle. Abdullah and Pari are reunited, but sadly Abdullah has Alzheimer's and doesn't remember her or the past.<br /><br />I think that this was an emotional tale of the harsh realities that life sometimes presents. The ugly side of life that sometimes must be dealt with and how people handle it. There are some heartbreaking scenes and some little pearls of hope scattered through out. There is a contrast of the people who have things and those that have not.<br /><br />The middle of the book seems to meander around. I wasn't sure what the point of the story was when all these different characters were introduced with their own stories. Half way through the book I still wasn't sure what I thought of it. The ending made the book for me and everything came to together. I think that I liked A Thousand Splendid Sons and The Kite Runner just a little better than this one. The story is presented in a much different manner this time. In spite of all that I have to say that I still love his writing style and that I feel that this is an excellent book. I read it last week and I am still able to vividly recall parts that touched me. Not every book leaves a lasting impression! I give this book 4.5 stars out of 5.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I wanted something that would let me stream Netflix offerings to my TV in a simple way and at a reasonable price. This device does that, but with a couple of stumbles along the way.<br /><br />First, set-up didn't work properly the first time, which was a little alarming for a device that is highly touted for its simple installation. I suspect it was a local network problem. I repeated the process and got the connection working on the second try.<br /><br />I set up device control on both a recent Android phone and on a year-old iPad. Since you control the TV display from your wireless device (pause/resume, forward/back, subtitles and so forth) rather than your standard remote, there is lag time in making changes because you have to wake your controller up and let it figure out the current state of your Netflix stream before you can, for example, pause the stream. A couple of times my iPad has lost all playback control completely, and I had to power-cycle the device to get it to connect with the Netflix controllers correctly. Maybe I am unwittingly doing something that messes up the connection, or maybe not. Still, a properly designed control system should make it impossible for a new user of the technology to march in the wrong direction.<br /><br />A caution: if your HDTV is an older one (say 2007 or before), it may have only one HDMI port on the back. If so, and if that port is given over to a cable box connection, you will need an HDMI switch to accommodate both your cable feed and the Chromecast device. Or you can use a set of standard cords to get the cable signal into your TV, freeing up the HDMI attachment point. In the worst case, you can just unplug the one and plug in the other when you need to switch feeds.<br /><br />You can't beat the price, but I'm wondering if I will end up with something better (Roku?) to replace this as time goes by. We'll see.<br /><br />[Edited after posting to correct typos.]
B0036EH3UC|5.0|One of the best television shows of the early 21st century (so far). Battlestar Galactica does away with the hoary tropes of cheesy sci-fi and instead confronts the very human issues of power, politics, love, war, acceptance, betrayal, faith, hope, and survival. Watch and think.
B00DHHWXYY|5.0|Saw this at the movies in 3D.  Stunning! It will probably never be as good on the home screen, but the sets, the clothes, and the jewellery will be wonderful no matter what. I was never a great fan of Leonardo DiCaprio until I saw this, and I have to say he was fantastic. It's a wonderful story, and if this was directed by the same guy who was responsible for the dreadful Australia movie, he has been redeemed.
B009C7JS14|5.0|This application is a great help to me in keeping track of weather in my city where I live. I am updated to all aspects of the current situation.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I really like the show Suits.  I have finally gotten caught up with the series.  It is refreshing and I enjoy the story lines...
055358894X|5.0|Scott Lynch is at the top of his genre. His writting is fun and clever. I am currently awaiting his 3rd book in the series (Repubic of Thieves). Think medieval con-man/rogue with all the accompanying humour and violence. Similiar to Joe Abercrombie with more humour.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Good book.  I recommend.  Only gave it four stars because it wasn't until halfway through that I became interested.  Worth reading.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Was very enjoyable going through this game/app but...I think it was too short.<br />I enjoyed this and recommend it to anyone with the mindset that needs to be challenged....You will enjoy it as much as I did...
B0071T4BVC|5.0|McCartney provides more evidence of his wonderful ability to entertain. I'm 63 and remember my father singing these songs. The Ink Spots would be please with his \\"My Echo, My Shadow and Me\\". His song choices and his voice are exquisite. Backed by Diana Krall's band, this is more than could be expected. I love it
B000F8O2PG|5.0|I love SG1 it is my favorite television show of all time. I love the cast, the characters, and the storylines. Richard Dean Anderson is  great as Colonel O'Neil, he is fun and witty, Amanda Tapping honors womanhood, she is beautiful, smart and compassionate. Michael Shanks Daniel Jackson is right on the mark for anyone who saw the movie, he is also compassionate and a real genius.. And last but not least Christopher Judge brings honor and dignity to the show in the role as Teal'c. I would recommend it to anyone who likes Sci-Fi.
B0043JEA14|5.0|It's great to hear the DB's on their latest album. The sound is both fresh and familiar. Easy to listen to, and in total keeping with their old standards that we all know so well. If you get this, you won't be disappointed.
B00BKTFABE|2.0|If You Have A Facebook You Can Easily Look up on the staus bar there will be a picture of a camera click it will pop up to take pictures on the left click it and there it will switch to recording videos<br />  I Think It Works Way Better than This app but if u dont use facebook This App IS okay And Free.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|So funny and relatable!  It's witty, catchy, and perfect!  Men and women, teens and tweens - all can appreciate it the same!
B00E5C3AJM|5.0|I had the first Star Girl, and I absolutely loved it! Then I found this and WOW! All new designs, and Italia Moda! It's even more glam than before!
B00EI6E17A|5.0|I love this song! It's catchy and fun to sing along to. Definitely looking forward to hearing more of Gaga's new music.
B001H1SVO8|1.0|I heard so many people saying this is a great movie. I don't see it. Acting was great, but the story line and theme is too abstract, making interpretation with shrugging shoulders. How deep does a viewer have to go to make an attempt at understanding what the script writer is really trying to convey. Too cryptic in my opinion. Is it a dream or is it schizophrenic experience? Didn't care for the violence and destruction to make social changes.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very easy to install and easy to use with iOS or android device.  Turned my phone into a remote. Very glad I bought it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Loved the complex story, the balanced rendering of the disparate characters.  Wondered a bit about the fate of the family that lived in the large house in the village and the legal owners. Am hoping more will be revealed in the next book.
B00006CXSS|5.0|This was offered at almost 2/3 of what the retail price for this set sells for.  Always look for &#34;Like new&#34; .
B00D8HNR2K|4.0|After announcing that Nine Inch Nails would go on hiatus, Trent Reznor spent his time on his side project, How To Destroy Angels.  After releasing their first full-length album, Reznor returned to NIN for a long-overdue greatest hits record and recorded two songs for it, \\"Everything\\" and \\"Satellite\\".  Then it seems the floodgates opened, and more songs came out.  Now we have Hesitation Marks, the blessed return of Nine Inch Nails, and it's a damn good record.<br /><br />It's clear from the outset that Reznor was heavily influenced by his days with How To Destroy Angels.  Despite the artwork purposefully bearing a strong resemblance to The Downward Spiral as well as having that suicide-themed album title, Hesitation Marks actually has no resemblance to Spiral at all.  In fact, it can best be described as the mixture of HTDA and NIN's The Fragile and Ghosts I-IV albums.  The mix is pretty interesting, and the result is a Nine Inch Nails album that sounds nothing like its predecessors.  Much more electronica than rock, much more melody than noise, the album swirls along at a fairly brisk and satisfying pace.  With only 12 proper songs and two short instrumentals serving as the beginning and end, it feels like a pretty tight effort.  Lyrically it's classic NIN, however.  Long time fans really won't find any new territory there.  Take that as you will...some will love the writing on Hesitation Marks, but I wouldn't be surprised at anyone who may find the lyrics to have a bit of a \\"been there, done that feel\\".  Plus, while some songs are brilliant in their musical construction, there are a couple of tracks that sound a little too close to past songs for comfort.  First single \\"Came Back Haunted\\" is as formulaic as they come.  As someone else pointed out, you could almost sing \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" perfectly to it.  The song also closes with the now-familiar two-note-at-a-time melody that Reznor's loved using since The Downward Spiral.  Another track, \\"Various Methods of Escape\\" sounds like a sort of sequel to With Teeth's \\"Sunspots\\".<br /><br />But despite those, there are some real defining moments on this album.  \\"Copy of A\\" is by far one of the most interesting songs Reznor has done for NIN, and I'm so glad it was released as a single as well!  Purely electronic in nature, the song moves at a frantic, rhythmic pace with synths laced throughout, weaving in and out.  The amazing \\"All Time Low\\" is easily one of the best Nine Inch Nails songs ever recorded.  It goes from slinky, funky guitars during the verses to a deep pulsing beat for the chorus...all before ending on an ethereal shower of chiptune and synths.  \\"Everything\\", which has so far been a love-it-or-hate-it affair with fans, is pure bliss in my opinion.  Sounding more like a lost Pearl Jam song, it's the grungiest song on this album, but also has the happiest sound of any NIN song.  \\"I've survived everything!\\" sings Reznor triumphantly, then you even get multi-layered harmonies before the song darkens up a little.  The very experimental songs \\"Disappointed\\" and \\"Running\\" are the ones that most-closely resemble Ghosts I-IV, only with vocals, while the quiet \\"Find My Way\\" hearkens back to How To Destroy Angels.<br /><br />I have to give props to Trent Reznor for also doing deluxe edition albums the way they SHOULD be done.  I have to say that this is a trend in music today that I find abhorrent.  I loathe this, \\"be cheap and get part of the album, or pay almost double to hear the entire thing!\\" mentality that's somehow become the norm.  Hesitation Marks' deluxe set only has more elaborate packaging and a bonus disc with remixes rather than full-on new songs.  This keeps the integrity of the album, but gives fans a little something extra.  The remixes, however, are superb!  I'm not the biggest fan of remixes, but these are noteworthy in that they're incredibly well-done.  The remix of \\"All Time Low\\" takes an already-perfect song and makes it an eargasm with the harmonized \\"stretch across the sky\\" line.  That remix is worth the extra cost alone.<br /><br />After the experimental Ghosts I-IV and the hastily-crafted freebie, The Slip, it's nice to hear Nine Inch Nails put out a consistent and high-quality proper album!
B000T2KGEY|5.0|Can't get much better than this for straight-ahead jazz.  Great solos, good sound and very swinging.  I think I've owned this recording in every format: vinyl, CD and now MP3.
B00EPQQ2PW|5.0|This album is definitely one of my best music purchases ever.  I cannot say that this is my favorite type of music, nor that the album contains one of my favorite songs of the year, but it is absolutely one of the best complete albums I have ever purchased.  Every song is different, and every song is good.  I am absolutely awestruck at Dan's chilling vocals and the fantastic rhythmic variation and harmonies that accompany them.  This is pure talent (and creativity!).<br /><br />As a side note, I'm completely baffled by the mediocre critical reception of this album.  If that's holding you back, don't let it!  This should be album of the year.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really couldn't put it down. Once you begin this book I hope your schedule is clear. That really goes for the entire series. The books are far superior to the movies. Please do not skip reading to go to the theater. You'll miss a lot. This particular book in the series was gripping because it really explored the inner struggle of the main character and her role as figurehead for the cause. I don't want to give away too much. Just read... you won't be disappointed! This book appeals to many different people who typically enjoy various genres, this is based solely on people I have spoken to about their reading experience.
B005IS56CG|5.0|5FDP has become one of my favorite bands, thanks in large part to this CD. If you haven't heard them and you love hard rock, BUY THIS ALBUM!!!
B00D8HNR5W|4.0|Here's where Hesitation Marks falls into my top 5 NIN albums list. I've been a NIN fan since the early 90's. Take it for what it's worth.<br /><br />1. Pretty Hate Machine<br />2. The Downward Spiral<br />3. Hesitation Marks<br />4. With Teeth<br />5. (tie) Broken/The Fragile<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first 6 tracks...the second half of the album, while it may still grow on me, is not really my cup of tea.<br /><br />**UPDATE**<br /><br />I've now listened to this album about 20 times over. The second half of it HAS grown on me! (Except for \\"Everything\\". That track could be deleted from the album and I wouldn't miss it. Not a pop fan.)<br /><br />My top 5 tracks from this album:<br /><br />1. All Time Low<br />2. Came Back Haunted<br />3. Copy of a<br />4. In Two<br />5. Disappointed<br />6, for good measure: Satellite
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I have read every single book he's written and he never ceases to completely enthrall me and leave me wanting more.  I've said time and again that he is the best and my very favorite author.  Pillars of the Earth is my favorite book of all time.  Fall of Giants was given to me and my dad as a joint Christmas present. He read it first, then it was my turn.  He died two and a half years ago and I felt him with me throughout this whole novel.  I wish he was still here so we could talk about it.  My only criticism of Ken Follett's work would be that there's just simply not enough.  I read this in one week.  I need more!!!!  Seriously, it was wonderful.  Thank you Ken!  Keep 'em coming.  When's the next one due out?!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this game the graphics are great the levels are progressively harder and it is extremely addictive. I would recommend this game to anyone. It works great on my phone (moto-razor Max) and my phone sucks.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|it;s  like playing the &quot;seek and find&quot; puzzles, brings back memories of waiting rooms with the highlights magazines. it can be frustrating trying to find the items in the short time frame.  good time killer
1446301583|5.0|So many ideas...I need ideas for my sewing room and decorations.  Friendship and Fairy gifts...so much, cannot wait to make these projects.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Great app it works just like it says now I don't have to worry about packing a sound machine because of the white noise feature
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|Its funny how immediately after an established band that's been around for a while comes out with a new album all the fan-boys give reviews saying it's the greatest thing ever.  I am a Nine Inch Nails fan too and have all their albums, so I'd thought I'd give my review which I hope is a little more fair.<br /><br />It's an electronic based album with some guitar, bass, and other instrument overlays, similar to \\"Year Zero\\" but with better song writing and not as much experimentation.  I'm fine with that since it's different than what you usually hear, except I have a hard time digesting the electronic drums.  I just don't like the drum machine sound, especially when it consists of clap along beats which are prevalent throughout the album. Fortunately some of the songs also feature someone hitting the toms.<br /><br />Getting past the drumming, the music's pretty cool although there isn't a lot of variety to it.  It would be nice if they mixed it up a little like they did on their earlier releases with some fast rocking songs like \\"Wish\\", \\"March Of The Pigs\\", or \\"Survivalism\\", or with some slow songs like \\"Hurt\\".<br /><br />After listening to it a hand full of times, my favorite songs are \\"Copy Of A\\", \\"Everything\\", \\"Came Back Haunted\\", \\"Satellite\\" and \\"All Time Low\\".  The most controversial one is \\"Everything\\" which a lot of people have said is a pop song.  I would say it's more of an 80s style New Wave song, which makes it the most unique song on the album.  I don't see it as much more pop then previous songs they've done like \\"Only\\", \\"Down In It\\", \\"Sin\\", or even \\"Closer\\".<br /><br />Overall, I think this album is better than their last few albums, but not as good as the ones before that.  So I would recommend it if you are a big Nine Inch Nails fan or like electronic music.  Otherwise I'd wait to hear some of the songs and/or listen to the samples before getting it.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This game at first glance seems boring, but it is addictive, the higher the level, the more challenging and deceptive....great app
B001U7B4T8|1.0|The DVD was about one-third short of the whole concert.  That it was abbreviated was not stated in the listing! I would not have ordered a shortened version.
1439192812|5.0|Beautifully written and illustrated. Dawkins delivers as always.<br /><br />a must have for the free thinker and the media driven zombie alike.  nothing but facts, philosophy and beautiful illustrations to bring it all to life.  a book everyone should have in their home.  great for adults and children
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I didn't care for this story. If you are looking for erotica there are many authors that deserve your attention. This is not one of them. It's a story of an emotionally and physically abusive relationship thinly veiled as a love story. As a side note you can start a rousing game of keeping track how many time the author uses the word &#34;baby&#34;.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show. Well made, good acting. I highly recommend. There are a few flaws, but highly entertaining and well worth the watch
B009NY43NY|5.0|Great book in the series. Really adore the characters and story line. I typically read them in one night. :)
B001EBWINQ|5.0|Yeah, he is tough...tough as nails...when you are dealing with Nazis you have to be, but, his love conquers his tough-guy veneer and he allows his one true love to slip out of his life for good because it is the right thing to do in the dark days of 1941.  Humphrey Bogart is at his best in this classic!  A truly great picture!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Really like this s game! Lots of fun! Only complaint, no way to earn&quot; virtual cash, you HAVE to buy it
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|I saw the original version with S. Stallone. It was bad enough.  This one really stinks........  I'm sick of the violence and hate!  Is this what we have come to???  What a sad time in Man's History............
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|I got excited for this movie every time I saw the movie trailer somewhere online. It started out great and interesting and it kept that pace through the movie until Brad Pitt goes to a research facility to share a theory about a possible cure.<br /><br />From there all the suspense and excitement went out the window. I could tell that everyone in the theater lost the grip of suspense the movie had on them when people started snickering at some of the zombie acting.<br /><br />There is never any exciting answers or battles once Brad leaves the facility. No memorable story or grand finale scenes to leave you thinking. So the movie ends and you are left with the idea that the story is not over. Then comes the credits. Lame. So I was let down by the amazing trailer.<br /><br />Not a title worth owning but something worth watching on a movie night when there is nothing better to watch.
B00DPY95D6|5.0|I was hooked from the first page At first I thought the girl was having mental break down, but as time went on I thought differently. The mix of super natural and court drama was amazing. Can't wait to read more from this author.
B0073LWEXK|3.0|where is it.  not where its supposed to be.  I must have passed by it first time around and now I cant finish the game.  trying to decide if I want to erase the game and start over or just move on.  and now I cant submit my review.
B00EOFIYZA|4.0|I already own Halcyon and am not going to dock stars for that. Its just childish especially with so many Ellie fans who'd split the cost.<br /><br />Songs I'd HIGHLY recommend:<br />Tessellate<br />Burn<br />Under Control<br /><br />Great tracks, smooth, powerful, and they flow perfectly. I purchased all the others I could as singles and its nice to hear new Ellie tracks however I'd highly recommend getting remixes of the others (if they come out or ever even exist).<br /><br />I was a little disappointed that her cover of 'High for This' wasn't on the album or even on amazon as I refuse to give apple a dime.<br /><br />For those three tracks you'll pay less than you would for a sandwich and hear all the extra tracks worth hearing.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This book was extremely insightful made me aware of some things, validated others and gave me motivation for the rest.
B00EOFJAT4|5.0|This is easily the most powerful and exceptional track on her new addition to Halcyon. Highly recommend as its one of the few I've left on repeat for a few hours.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I thought this would be something great, but i guess im wrong.  If you already have a PlayStation or Apple TV then what is the benefit of this device?  I dont use NetFlix and if i did i would use it on my PS3, or even my TV (it has the app built in).<br />Once you plug the dongle in the TV you MUST also plug the other end into USB or DC power.  I was under the impression you could just put it on the back of your TV.  Many of my TV's are new and none of them have a USB port on back so the only option was to run the separate power cable.<br />So now i can beam YouTube over to my TV set, well, yay i guess, if i really want to see YouTube content, for that I typically just sit on my computer.<br />I guess this would be great for a dorm room or tiny one bedroom apartment or someone with no cable etc... but for the average user with a computer and other media devices like Apple TV or PS3 i don't see the use for this.<br />I guess if i had a video of some sort on my device that i wanted to send to my TV instead of just showing the person directly i could do that but ive never had the need to do that.<br />I dunno, i used it once tonight when i got it, probably won't use it again.  Good thing its so cheaply priced or i would probably return it.

B00AC8ZA3M|3.0|An ok movie.  I haven't played the game so maybe that makes a difference.  I think my 13 year old grandson would have liked it better than I did.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Because the fire is heavier then the other Kindles you need this cover. I have had mine over two years and it still looks like the day I bought it. I love that it holds my book up so I can read hands free. The cover is very sturdy. Great buy.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|I had read the series several years ago and it is great, I wiibe getting the rest of the series
B00BC24NT4|4.0|Outsourcing foreign policy has consequences, none good.  This is a book that needed to be written and I wish it were kinder to US motives and methods but what is, is.  It is well written as Le Carre always does, but it's hard to stomach the British disdain for Americans and America. Le Carre would have a German pen name rather than French if the US hadn't saved his country's bacon so he needs to get off his high horse about the US and show some gratitude.  That said, we need to stop letting born again ideologues fund our misadventures and stop with the mercenaries that are running amuck in our name.  It's a good read, well crafted.  Didn't like the end though.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I like the quick read, perfect for a summer holiday.  A bit of a different plot, which makes it an enjoyable read.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|Don't get me wrong. I can't stand his egotistical and acting tough as always but he's musically genius. He takes a risk with the sound and everything that he's done. In my opinion, Yeezus is one of the best work that I've heard if only you like good music and not caring about success and biggest hit at all. It's all about good music and able to play it persistently for days. It's way ahead of game so possibly years later, people will go back to this album and change their mind. If I have to pick a favorite track, it's hard to choose so I would have to say 'Guilt Trip'.
0786891416|3.0|I found this a little boring...so I gave it to someone else to read and they loved it.  Perhaps I wasn't in the right mood for reading this book.

B00BEZTMFY|4.0|I loved this movie, just as much as the Lord of the Rings trilology. It would definately be one that I would recommend
0307460444|4.0|I love this book.  Not all of the recipes have worked for me, since some of the chocoalte ones produce a dense cake which I am not a fan of, and success can vary based on your oven, elevation above sea level, and climate; but there are a lot of great ideas in here.  Most of the recipes are simple enough that even a new baker can follow them, but there are some that are more technical than others if you're looking for a challenge.<br /><br />Make sure you follow the instructions to a \\"T,\\" like making sure you let your ingredients come to room temperature fully before you begin - it really makes a difference.  Some of my favorites include the Cream Cheese frosting, Chocolate Ganache, brown butter glaze, carrot cupcakes, spice cupcakes (these were super tasty but a little dry, so use a nice moist frosting or glaze), snickerdoodle (also a tad dry, but loved them anyway), red velvet, and apple spice.<br /><br />Even if I don't have time to scratch make a cake, most of the frostings use six or less ingredients, are very easy, and only take minutes to whip up. Plus, they taste much better than the canned stuff at the store!  I have used this book dozens of times and will use it many more.
B009RX7IX8|4.0|I regularly watch this show although not as faithfully as in the past, and I own all the previous season DVD sets. For those interested, this set is not available in high definition or Blu-ray. There are five DVD discs and the box also includes three unimpressive trading cards. Available subtitles in the set are English, French and Spanish.<br /><br />Since viewing the episodes is readily available in a number of ways, usually the extras are a compelling reason to buy the season, but when I checked, everything appeared to be available for viewing on-line including the bloopers, deleted scenes, Your Home is Your Castle about Castle's penthouse and Beckett's loft sets hosted by interior designer Vern Yip, Ryan and Esposito's \\"Lot Cops\\" humorous piece about tactical training, Martha's Master Class about acting including an amusing behind the scenes view of Lives of Others.<br /><br />Even the audio commentaries are available on-line which was done for four episodes, Target (Bill Roe - director, David Amann - writer, Susan Sullivan and Molly Quinn,) Hunt (Andrew Marlowe - creator/writer, Rob Bowman - director, Nathan Fillion and Molly Quinn,) Lives of Others (Andrew Marlowe and Terry Edda Miller - writers, Marta Evry - editor and Robert Duncan - composer) and The Final Frontier (Jonathan Frakes - director, Luke Reichle costume coordinator, and Nathan Fillion.) This year, Stana Katic, Jon Huertas and Seamus Dever were not included.<br /><br />Of the four commentaries I learned the most from The Lives of Others. Having the insight of the writers, editor and composer added a level of understanding to the behind the scenes creation of the episode that the actors simply can't provide. Unless revealing background information like it was really hot, or I hurt my wrist in that scene, the actors rarely have much of interest to add, which is why the technical people, if they are articulate, can provide a wealth of information.<br /><br />The Final Frontier commentary was my next favorite but only because the players seemed to be enjoying themselves. And although there were annoying pauses because they forgot themselves and started silently watching the episode, at least it wasn't awkward.<br /><br />During the Hunt commentary, the conversations between Marlowe and Bowman were the most interesting and enlightening. The Target commentary was largely forgettable with Susan Sullivan valiantly trying to gracefully draw the writer and director out of their reserve.<br /><br />Martha's Master Class is an entertaining piece. And, as watchable as Ryan and Esposito's training segment is, it seemed a little too long. The blooper reel isn't quite as funny as last year's compilation and sometimes dragged, but it is always fun to see the actors at work flubbing their lines and goofing-off. And, finally the tour of the Castle penthouse and Beckett loft was interesting. The extras while not overly generous, were also not stingy.<br /><br />The show has a terrific cast, and when everything is working it is a unique blend of loose, often outright sloppy police procedural and light comedy with important romantic elements and witty, snarky dialog. It can be quite entertaining, but when the balance is off, which I felt it was this season, the comedy serves to undo a scene rather than contribute to it leaving the viewer struggling to recapture equilibrium.<br /><br />Although definitely better than season four, I felt there were many missed opportunities. These moments, created by the leads finally getting together, were largely left unexplored or hastily touched upon in a manner I found unsatisfying. And, the chemistry between the leads is a given and an incredible asset for the show, but oddly the pairing was approached with noticeable caution and the actors sometimes seemed uncomfortable together.<br /><br />Diehard fans may automatically purchase this set, but if unsure whether to buy, check out the extras and episodes first.favorite but only because the players seemed to be enjoying themselves.

0525478817|4.0|There's a moment in Shakespeare's Julius Caesar when the Roman nobleman, Cassius, says to another nobleman, Brutus, \\"The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves, that we are underlings.\\" The context of Cassius' statement is that his and Brutus' unjust destinies are not the result of anything supernatural (something \\"in the stars\\"), but of their own poor choices.<br /><br />This is a statement that has held its place in culture, but author John Green's latest book seeks to dismantle this philosophy.<br /><br />Green  himself, in response to a reader's question, writes, \\". . . that's ridiculous. There is plenty of fault in our stars. Many people suffer needlessly not because they've done something wrong or because they're evil or whatever but because they get unlucky. I wanted to try to write a novel about how we navigate a world that isn't fair, and whether it's possible to have a full and meaningful life even if you don't get to play out your life on a grand stage the way Cassius and Brutus did\\" (The Fault in Our Stars: Collector's Edition, 4).<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is a book starring Hazel Grace Lancaster, a 16 year old cancer survivor whose physical life has been left in shambles from her battle. Her lungs, as Hazel herself describes, \\"suck\\" and she is subjected to toting oxygen around wherever she goes. To say that she lives an abnormal teenage life would be a grand understatement.<br /><br />The novel takes off when Hazel attends a support group and meets another cancer survivor named Augustus Waters, a quick-witted, humorously-cynical 17 year old boy who quickly falls in love with her. The two embark on a philosophical journey together as they share their deepest emotions concerning the unjust landscape of their lives.<br /><br />POSITIVE ELEMENTS<br /><br />Augustus Waters is arguably one of the most lovable characters in modern day fiction. I recently told my wife that \\"I wish he were real, because I would love to know him.\\" He is the rare personality that brightens up life because he sees it from a unique angle. Some of the more humorous portions of the novel exist when Augustus sacrifices his video game avatar to save nonexistent, pixelated innocents. In so doing, his character naturally dies and he himself loses the game. But this is how Augustus plays the game, because it's how Augustus plays life. He is obsessed with the concept of dying an honorable, meaningful death, and has a difficult time reconciling how that is possible when one dies of cancer.<br /><br />It is Augustus that helps bring life to the dying protagonist, Hazel Grace. The friendship and relationship they foster is certainly a positive element to the story and although they both live on the diving board of death, together they are capable of standing firm on that slippery, flimsy board.<br /><br />SPIRITUAL CONTENT<br /><br />Much of The Fault in Our Stars is spiritual. A quick Google search will reveal that John Green considers himself a Christian, although he allegedly doesn't like boxing himself in with this title. The support group takes place in a church, God is often alluded to, and Bible verses even appear here and there, albeit out of context.<br /><br />To say that the book paints an accurate picture of biblical Christianity, however, would be far-fetched. In fact, I would go as far as to say that God is often recreated and mocked. Augustus and Hazel would be what I consider nominal Christians. They seem to understand the basic concepts, like most Americans would, but they certainly don't live by godly standards. It is assumed that everyone goes to heaven and that those that die of cancer might even have a special place there, although, to be fair, the protagonists seem to deny this claim.<br /><br />The novel's title, in and of itself, suggests that there is fault with God's sovereignty in creation, and that mankind isn't responsible, or at least as responsible, as Shakespeare's Cassius alleged. Spiritually speaking, this is simply not the case. The fault is not in God (\\"the stars\\"), but a result of the Fall of Genesis 3. This is arguably my largest contention with the novel. Green assumes that all people are good and that things like cancer are unfair additions to life. While I would agree that cancer, and other evils like it, are horrible and devastating occurrences, we cannot ignore that such things are the inevitable result of mankind's decision to disobey God. Thus, Cassius was right. The fault is in ourselves.<br /><br />There are other claims about God in the novel, one being a fictional father in a fictional novel that the fictional author, Peter Van Houten, claims represents God (which isn't in good taste). But one of the more revealing aspects of Green's spiritual claims might be in an answer he gives to a reader in the Collector's Edition of his novel. Green writes that \\"books belong to their readers,\\" which, contextually speaking, was Green's way of saying that readers have the freedom to interpret elements of the story to their own desires. If this is a block of Green's foundation to his worldview, then it might explain how he interprets the Bible, which consequently affects much of what he believes it means to be a Christian, which affects his view of \\"the stars.\\"<br /><br />SEXUAL CONTENT<br /><br />There is essentially one major sexual episode when Augustus and Hazel engage in premarital sex during their trip to Amsterdam. There are other episodes of various characters, including Augustus and Hazel, kissing.<br /><br />VIOLENT CONTENT<br /><br />The book is inherently violent insofar as it is about kids with cancer, and Green pulls no punches in relating the facts about what a kid might go through when dealing with such a disease. In preparing for this book, Green spent time serving as a chaplain at a hospital with terminally ill children and wanted to convey the painful reality of death, not the graceful death often painted in other novels.<br /><br />CRUDE LANGUAGE<br /><br />The novel includes various uses of \\"s-t\\" and \\"d-m.\\"<br /><br />DRUG AND ALCOHOL CONTENT<br /><br />No drug content, but the characters, underage, do partake of champagne. To my recollection there are no scenes where the characters get drunk. Augustus often has a cigarette in his mouth, but he  never lights it. It is a metaphor that he is in control of his life and that this tool of death has no power over him.<br /><br />OTHER NEGATIVE ELEMENTS<br /><br />The most negative elements of this novel rest in the influence it will undoubtedly bring to its young readers. Because it is such an engaging read and because the characters are so lovable, I can see many students learning from much of the fictional elements involved, treating them as truth. There are false concepts of mathematics (specifically claims on the philosophical understanding of infinity) and medicine, as well as misguided claims of biblical Christianity. There are also logically fallible philosophical claims that have little, if any, warrant. Green opens the book in writing, \\"This book is a work of fiction. I made it up,\\" but this does little to clarify what is real and what is not real in its claims.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is a very enjoyable read. It's hard to put down and it can be read quickly. I would not personally recommend it to any person younger than 16, and even with that (given my Christian faith), I would be cautious. It makes a variety of philosophical claims about life and can serve as a tool for philosophical discussions concerning gratuitous evils, which are conversations parents should have with their children. But it is my conviction that these conversations should be rooted and cultivated by Scripture, not fiction. Although, fiction is a fun way to add to the conversation after a firm foundation has been built in God's Word.<br /><br />I give the book 4 out of 5 stars.peaking, this is simply not the case. The fault is not in God (\\"the stars\\"), but a result of the Fall of Genesis 3. This is arguably my largest contention with the novel. Green assumes that all people are good and that things like cancer are unfair additions to life. While I would agree that cancer, and other evils like it, are horrible and devastating occurrences, we cannot ignore that such things are the inevitable result of mankind's decision to disobey God. Thus, Cassius was right. The fault is in ourselves.<br /><br />There are other claims about God in the novel, one being a fictional father in a fictional novel that the fictional author, Peter Van Houten, claims represents God (which isn't in good taste). But one of the more revealing aspects of Green's spiritual claims might be in an answer he gives to a reader in the Collector's Edition of his novel. Green writes that \\"books belong to their readers,\\" which, contextually speaking, was Green's way of saying that readers have the freedom to interpret elements of the story to their own desires. If this is a block of Green's foundation to his worldview, then it might explain how he interprets the Bible, which consequently affects much of what he believes it means to be a Christian, which affects his view of \\"the stars.\\"<br /><br />SEXUAL CONTENT<br /><br />There is essentially one major sexual episode when Augustus and Hazel engage in premarital sex during their trip to Amsterdam. There are other episodes of various characters, including Augustus and Hazel, kissing.<br /><br />VIOLENT CONTENT<br /><br />The book is inherently violent insofar as it is about kids with cancer, and Green pulls no punches in relating the facts about what a kid might go through when dealing with such a disease. In preparing for this book, Green spent time serving as a chaplain at a hospital with terminally ill children and wanted to convey the painful reality of death, not the graceful death often painted in other novels.<br /><br />CRUDE LANGUAGE<br /><br />The novel includes various uses of \\"s-t\\" and \\"d-m.\\"<br /><br />DRUG AND ALCOHOL CONTENT<br /><br />No drug content, but the characters, underage, do partake of champagne. To my recollection there are no scenes where the characters get drunk. Augustus often has a cigarette in his mouth, but he  never lights it. It is a metaphor that he is in control of his life and that this tool of death has no power over him.<br /><br />OTHER NEGATIVE ELEMENTS<br /><br />The most negative elements of this novel rest in the influence it will undoubtedly bring to its young readers. Because it is such an engaging read and because the characters are so lovable, I can see many students learning from much of the fictional elements involved, treating them as truth. There are false concepts of mathematics (specifically claims on the philosophical understanding of infinity) and medicine, as well as misguided claims of biblical Christianity. There are also logically fallible philosophical claims that have little, if any, warrant. Green opens the book in writing, \\"This book is a work of fiction. I made it up,\\" but this does little to clarify what is real and what is not real in its claims.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br /><br />The Fault in Our Stars is a very enjoyable read. It's hard to put down and it can be read quickly. I would not personally recommend it to any person younger than 16, and even with that (given my Christian faith), I would be cautious. It makes a variety of philosophical claims about life and can serve as a tool for philosophical discussions concerning gratuitous evils, which are conversations parents should have with their children. But it is my conviction that these conversations should be rooted and cultivated by Scripture, not fiction. Although, fiction is a fun way to add to the conversation after a firm foundation has been built in God's Word.<br /><br />I give the book 4 out of 5 stars.

B008YECFUW|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this graphic novel. Its bald faced truthfulness was sometimes hard to read, but overall I felt a strong kinship with the author and her experiences as a child and young adult. Essentially this is a therapy session and a coming of age story mashed together. Entirely worth a read.

B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|I cried again when Spock watches Kirk die. The tribbles really made this movie imho. It was and is very logical.<br />I wanted to point out (pun intended) that Spock from the original series was Nimoy IRL and he played on a show called Mission Impossible, so it would only be reasonable to assume some of that show carried over to ST. The original series also had Kirk and Spock dress up in disguise and sneak around places incognito, very happy to see that in this movie. I also think JJ Abrams did something that so many sci-fi nerds overlook, he included a woman's view. I bought the amazon version because it never gets lost or stolen, etc. This one is worth keeping for future viewing.

034580709X|4.0|I toiled over the 4-star rating, as this is what you expect from Jo Nesbo, if not more.  On it's own it probably deserves 5 stars.  However, this book would have been so much better if I hadn't read most of the other Harry Hole novels first.  The character of Harry is so much stronger with this important initial introduction -- including the correct pronunciation of his name, which always struck me as a rather odd (and dirty) name when pronounced in the western style, better suited to a porn star than a Norwegian detective.<br /><br />Having read the other books first, much of this introduction grated against my misconceptions, detracting from my ability to fully enjoy the book.<br /><br />I know this isn't the author's fault, but the out-of-order publication dates of these books has always bothered me.  As an author myself, I hate it when I get criticized for something my publisher did, but hopefully Mr. Nesbo will forgive me since he's doing rather well, regardless :-)  (And I'll make it up to him by buying the remaining two novels in the series, if they're ever available in the US)<br /><br />For those who are new to Harry Hole, I recommend this highly.  Typical of Nordic Noir, the novel is approachable and readable by a western audience -- other than some umlaut-laden place names with more constants than we're used to, this is an easy read.  At the same time, the characters are extremely well developed, and the plot is sophisticated enough to keep regular mystery readers guessing.<br /><br />I'm an American but have spent some time in Oslo, and so I usually find the settings of Nesbo's novels especially fun.  The Bat took me a bit by surprise by taking place almost entirely in a place very far away for Norway.  Still, The Bat is sure to appeal to anyone who loves a good thriller, and I welcomed the nuances of Aussie culture just as much as the nordic culture that's prevalent in Nesbos other novels -- it's another finely crafted, exotic texture on an already fabulous story.<br /><br />Read them all, but READ THIS ONE FIRST if you can, because The Bat provides a welcome exposition of Harry that (I imagine) will make the remaining books even more enjoyable.lous story.<br /><br />Read them all, but READ THIS ONE FIRST if you can, because The Bat provides a welcome exposition of Harry that (I imagine) will make the remaining books even more enjoyable.
B004IPPINW|1.0|Having reaped all the advatages this wonderful country (U.S) had offered the author he has the gall and audacity to feel empathy for the awful terrorist for the 9/11 tragedy. This gentleman's priorities are all screwed up. He dosen't know the first thing about gratitude, and bless his lucky stars to have lived in a free world, where  freedom of thought,and speech are regarded as one's fundamental rights. I was thoroughly disgusted with the author's thought process and his embittered conclusions. I would not reccomend this book to anyone.

B005S9EKCW|1.0|Les Mis is emotional enough without the added overdramatization of this movie. It actually turned me off (and the play always makes me cry). The play is much better. I think Les Mis is something that belongs on a stage whereas The Phantom of the Opera needs the grandeur of the cinema. Les Mis failed in the filmed and excells on stage and the opposite for Phantom. (Check out the Gerard Butler version.)

I am a trained sexuality educator and can support sexual behavior between consenting adults,  However, depicting violence against women, especially &#34;punishment for disobedience&#34; in the context of a romantic relationship, only serves to condone domestic violence.  Not only is this book not entertaining, it is dangerous.

B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|They did it again.  I was there for the original Star Trek.  This series, and especially this movie capture the excitement and adventure that the original series strived for.  Wonderful acting.  Magnificant special effects. Terrific ensamble cast. Great story line.  Lots of twists and turns.  Couldn't have asked for more.  I'll watch it again and again.
B00AHHODH2|3.0|This was interesting.  It was kind of simple and then ended a little too fast - was interesting to see how fast they wrapped it up.  All very obviously trying to be unpredictable.  Not sure if I would read this author again.  Certainly a book that required little attention.  You can read without worrying about paying attention.

0812982622|3.0|Enough folks have already reviewed this book that it seems to do no harm to provide a spoiler.  Unlike many readers, I had little trouble following The Orphan Master's Son.  The format is peculiar; but it worked for me.  However, I cannot rate it higher than 3 or 3 1/2 stars; because of what I consider an ending, lacking in credibility.  Why did one character sacrifice himself to \\"save\\" another who really had no interest in being saved? The \\"savee\\" was indifferent and even rather hostile--a less than attractive character.  The message was lost on me.  After all that sturm und drang, to say nothing of the hard work of reading through it, one would like to have  had it all mean something.
0425263924|5.0|Very good read...would recommend to all adults. Besides the steamy scenes, there is an actual story line as well. Anxiously waiting for book 4 to come out.
B00EV4F5TC|4.0|Director Daniels' film is about the real life butler, Eugene Allen who served 7 presidents beginning with Eisenhower in 1957.  For whatever reason, his name was changed in this film to Cecil Gaines (Forest Whitaker).  The film opens in Macon, Georgia where Cecil (Isaac White) and his parents are sharecroppers on a cotton farm.<br /><br />In the south, things hadn't changed all that much from the Civil War.  Cecil's mother (Mariah Carey) is raped on a regular basis by one of the land owners (Alex Pettyfer).  When his father (David Banner) says something, he is gunned down in front of the boy.  The young boy is taken in to the \\"big\\" house and is trained to be a server to the family.  Once he has grown, he strikes out on his own and heads north.  He catches a job at a large Washington, D. C. hotel and gets a call from a White House staffer to come in for an interview.  He is hired and so it begins.<br /><br />Cecil's days at the White House, while at times interesting, are but a backdrop for what the film is really about.  The relationship between Cecil and his oldest son, Louis (David Oyelowo).  The heart of the film takes place during the civil rights struggles of 1960's and `70's.  As Louis gets older and heads off to college, he becomes more and more active in the civil rights movement, eventually becoming a \\"freedom rider\\" and then a member of the Black Panther Party.<br /><br />As Cecil struggles with his son's activism, his marriage to Gloria (Oprah Winfrey) is on the wane thanks to his long hours and her struggles with alcohol.  These are 3 terrific performances and they certainly carry the film, although I was admittedly curious to see how the various presidents and their wives would be portrayed by the line of celebrity actors who quickly step on and off the screen.  Most were just short of awful.<br /><br />I will also give a mention to Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carter Wilson, one of Cecil's co-workers.  He manages to add a bit of levity and humanity to many of the scenes.  Note also that there are some brutal portrayals, some staged for this film and some historical newsreels that provide viewers with a reminder of the struggles of the era.  This is a very strong film, more about family relationships and historical injustice as it is about Eugene Allen's distinguished career.e scenes.

B004U8VWLE|5.0|I think there are a lot of parts of the movie that some people don't understand, and people who do not like dark films definitely should not even try to watch this movie. But I have watched it many times. I love the details in it, I love all of the mirrors/reflective surfaces and other things about the way the movie was made, and I love the story in general. I often notice new things when I watch it and understand more of the story. I think it's beautiful and I also think Natalie was a great choice for the lead.

B006Q2LTRO|4.0|This book clearly describes the five love languages: words of affirmation, quality time, receiving gifts, acts of service, and physical touch. So if he believes he is showing her love by cooking dinner, and all she really wants is to hear the words \\"I love you,\\" a misunderstanding can begin....and a relationship can veer off course. Communication is the key to all healthy relationships, and this book can help a couple to build understanding and fortify their commitment to each other. A worthwhile read, for sure.

B00CTT9646|2.0|To begin with, this rating concerns only the phaser that is included with the collector's edition.  The blu-ray itself is the same as is sold separately, and the reviews for that product can be seen elsewhere.<br /><br />Frankly, the phaser that came with my collector's edition is of fairly poor quality.  It may be a fluke, others may have a different experience, but I'm badly disappointed.  To begin with, the magnetic spinning barrel has no mechanism to cause the spin other than manually spinning it with your fingers.  I expected the spin to be triggered by a trigger pull or a button press, but that was an assumption on my part so I mention it merely to inform others who may have thought the same.  Secondly, the paint that is used on the red barrel is applied unevenly and the silver shows clearly through it on one side.  Lastly, and most importantly, the various pieces of the phaser seem to be glued together without any real care taken to get the alignment right.  As a result, the top and bottom portions of the barrel guard do not line up correctly, multiple pieces appear to be twisted oddly off axis, and the spinner doesnt spin freely.  Instead the larger of the two barrels catches on the top barrel guard and has to be forced into place, rubbing pieces together with considerable force.  Additionally, the magnets that hold the barrel into its resting positions are misplaced such that the barrel appears to pointed considerably left of center by default.<br /><br />The whole thing looks reasonably decent if you leave it on a stand and view it from a distance, but considering the additional cost of the collector's edition I would have expected a much higher quality item.  I will be returning this and getting the blu-ray on its own.

B00EVLU2F2|5.0|Not everyone is looking for record to dance and party to.<br /><br />If you're looking for another \\"Supernature\\" than this album wasn't made for you. I don't really get why people get confused or shocked when Goldfrapp reinvents themselves and produces a sound so different from their more widely-known releases. That is one of the greatest stengths of this musical duo. They're so incredibly versatile and have talent and imagination beyond the scope of what people usually expect from musicians these days.<br /><br />That said, I appreciate the fact that they don't stick to some formula that appeals to mainstream audiences. Leaving behind the tribute to chunky uplifting 80's synthpop in \\"Head First\\", Goldfrapp returns with \\"Tales of Us\\" a cinematic dreamscape of hushed tones, soft pianos, rushing strings, and moody synths. It's not as disjointed and lively as \\"Felt Mountain\\" and not as warm and mercurial as \\"Seventh Tree\\" but it's a still return to form in a way. A return to sophistication and sensuality. Although, this time, in a much darker tone. The cover itself is the moodiest yet with Allison walking away from a collection of headlights hunched over as if she doesn't even want to be seen.<br /><br />This albums is a fascinating collection of stories all accompanied by mononym titles with the exception of the curiously titled \\"Stranger\\". It opens with \\"Jo\\" a mysterious lullaby about murder peppered with a piano that sounds somewhat like raindrops. \\"Annabel\\" follows a young boy exploring gender identity through his dreams. The livelier but distant \\"Drew\\", a song that I took as a man reminiscing about an orgy, features Alison practically sighing as she sings \\"feel the cold arrive in my bones\\". My personal favorite, \\"Thea\\", is the closest anyone will get to a dance track although the layered synths and the stomping beat evoke a desperate feeling of grasping for someone rather than the need to shake my hips or something. Then there's \\"Stranger\\" a breathy song with light guitars that sullenly coo's \\"you'd be killing me tenderly\\". The albums closes with the uplifting \\"Clay\\" a warm and gentle song about a soldier's words to his deceased lover, another male soldeir.<br /><br />In closing, \\"Tales of Us\\" is without a doubt a dark and beautiful entry into Goldfrapp's discography. I was somewhat disappointed with their last album \\"Head First\\" as it felt rushed and lacking in depth despite its overall positive demeanor. This is an astounding comeback and I look forward to what they will do next in the future.t guitars that sullenly coo's \\"you'd be killing me tenderly\\".

B005D9MUWY|5.0|Two years of using it and I won't go back to any other. It is chief amongst many reasons that I would never switch to an iPhone
B00E5INZ82|3.0|There is game's that's free that's better then this game .thay should pay you to play it r make it free
B00008S7KC|1.0|It wasnt a dvd I could play on my device.  It had some weird code or something.  Don't buy!!! Bad
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Inhaled the first book and purchased the second and third without hesitation... Can't wait for the movie to come out :-)
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Despite the irritating loop of the beautiful background sound, the game is good. Could improve the story and how it's narrated thought.
0446581356|5.0|I came across this book in Neiman Marcus a couple years ago looking to enhance my photography by doing my own makeup. The Bobbi Brown Makeup Manual gave me insight and proper techniques to achieve some of the looks i desired. Vivid color images and good technical writing. I like the book so much i purchased my sister who is a beautician a copy. I think you'll enjoy
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Addicting and challenging, yet easy play! I can play this game for an hour easy and wonder where the time went!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Amazing.<br />Captivating I finished this book so quickly and I'm rushing to buy the second one now... is this unhealthy? I'll probably lose whatever social life I had.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Well well well well well It's very so cool and you can never mind I didn't even play it yet
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a great game, it's fun and relaxing. I enjoy it so much that I have it on all of my devices!
B008ALAHA4|5.0|Works perfectly!  I upgraded to the new Macbook Air, but have an extra power cord, as well as older Macbook Air computers at home.  This inexpensive adapter saves me money (I don't have to buy new power cords) and space ( I don't have to store and carry extra power cords)
B00008RH3L|5.0|Great Cohen Bros. film.  Gabriel Bryne, Marcia Gay Harden, John Turturro and Albert Finnney are all wonderful as well as the story and snappy dialouge.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|The special features have been split up, the audio commentary doesn't even exist on a physical format, you can get it on iTunes instead, terrible.<br />The original aspect ratio for the IMAX sequences are not preserved and the \\"Hollywood Teal and Orange\\" make everything look horrendous.  The '09 Trek has normal tones, while this one just falls right into the fad of putting whatever was originally filmed into a color blender.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|I would not watch it again, but it was entertaining. Not as bad as the critics said. Good mindless shoot up flick.
B008200LHW|5.0|Works well with Windows 8 and both Microsoft Streets and Trips 2013 and Delorme Street Atlas 2012 Plus.  In order to get it to work with Delorme Street Atlas 2012 Plus, I had to first go to the GPS tab in the Options dialog and do the setup.  Specifically, I checked all the boxes in the \\"GPS Options\\" group and the first four boxes in the \\"When tracking...\\" group.
B00AC8ZJPQ|2.0|I am a big scify fan with a wide taste. This movie did not make me want to see any more Halo
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Very good and wait for everything new and I hope to communicate if there is anything new and thank you
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|It's not free they are liars and if you like the game it's just a waste of your time and download space
B00785P2QC|4.0|I have not been able to put t he game done sine I turned it on.<br />It is worth the time to check it out.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Good game nice challenges- but still not free and after this long after release date it should be or cheaper.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Fair warning there will be some slight spoilerish material in the review so if you have not seen it yet proceed with caution...<br /><br />Movies that are reboots of a franchise are always tricky, and then taking it a step further and making the reboot a franchise of its own can be even trickier. That is probably even more the case when the franchise is Star Trek. This does what all sequels strive to do (yet which many cannot) actually improve on the original movie.<br /><br />Like the first movie it blended action, drama, and humor. There was not a lot of character development in this movie since it was already done in the last one, but if you saw the first movie this one does not require a lot of set up. While all of the actors did remarkably well in their various roles the standout performance was Benedict Cumberbatch. They kept his role as much as a secret as possible when filming but  it is well known that he played Khan, the most formidable villain in the original series. He stole every scene he was in and brought presence to the screen every time he was on. As good as he is in the BBC series Sherlock, he as just as good playing one of the ultimate bad guys in the Star Trek universe. Zachary Quinto's portrayal of Spock continued to be very well done, and he does a great job playing homage to the character that Nimoy (who has a small cameo in the film) created, but making the role his own.<br /><br />Like the first movie this one has twists on the events from the original series show and movies. Even though some of the scenes were similar to things that happened in the show and the movies (some in a joking way, and others as major plot points)since the timeline was changed in the first movie things do not play out exactly as expected. In fact in more than one instance the roles of Kirk and Spock are flipped in situations that occurred in The Wrath of Kahn.<br /><br />The movie definitely sets up themes for the next movie, including introducing the Klingons andleaving open the possibility of Khan's return. The &#34;main&#34; events of this movie are all resolved by the end though so there was no definitive set up for what is to come, just hints. While it is inevitable that the movies will run out of steam at some point, J.J. Abrams has done a great job with the franchise so far, and if he maintains this quality and can keep the main actors on, then he can definitely get a lot more out of it. Personally I would love to see him introduce the Borg into this timeline, but that remains to be seen.<br /><br />The A/V quality of the blu ray is great, and the special effects are as good or better than in the first movie. As many have pointed out the extras you get depend on where you buy the movie. Different retailers discs have different special features. There will almost inevitably be some ultimate edition kind of release down the road that will combine them all, so if you are really into getting as many bonus features as possible, then you may want to wait. The stuff that is included in the Amazon release are fine, but there is more out there.<br /><br />In all I think your enjoyment of the movie itself will come down to whether you are a fan of the Star Trek franchise or just like sci-fi movies in general. If you fall into the latter category I think you can definitely find this enjoyable. If you are in the former, and can accept that the movie does change things that happened in the original story you will like it. Whether you want to shell out for the discs will probably depends on where you fall on the issue of the special features.  I think it warrants knocking the overall rating down a star because of the decision to split all the bonus material.  The movie itself is worth seeing but if the special feature issue bugs you then you probably want to stick with a rental or streaming.
143911000X|5.0|It's really funny me and my friends had a lot of fun sitting around and laughing about it!!  I would Definitely recommend it, very funny.
1476734941|5.0|I like this Diet it seems to work for me more then the other ones I tried over the years.
B00EL8JCGU|5.0|Would love to see the original ending to this movie to compare the changes made.  Did they give a semi-happy ending to appease the studio-heads?  Think this movie warrants a Director's cut that would be more detailed and have more scenes that must of been cut from it.  A great new twist of the zombie genre even if it did not follow the book much. I agree with another reviewer who said the Israeli soldier steals the film with her acting and the character's silent, tender strength.  I wonder if the hoodie the actress(soldier) wears  in the last several scenes were the re-shoots they did to please the studio heads?<br /><br />Really hope the alternate ending is included on the DVD, or will be part of a special release to come.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|This is an older movie that I learned about not too long ago and wanted to see it, and I'm glad I did. it was delivered on time and had no flaws
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|I saw this show last year and thought it was incredible. WHAT HAPPENED? The 5.1 sound does not work on the right front speaker or the surround speakers. What a disappointment after waiting for so long to come out. I will be returning it.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I am a huge Star Trek fan and I loved this movie.  I went to buy it today at Walmart as I knew it was the same price as Amazon only to see they are selling both Blu-Rays of Star Trek and Star Trek Into Darkness for $19.99.  I was kinda surprised and thought it was worth mentioning to people looking to buy the DVD's especially if they are going to buy two.  Why pay the same price for one DVD when you can get both for the same price?
B005LF9OCE|4.0|I liked it cause it makes me laugh, the only thing I didn't like is to much sexual talk.<br />cant watch it with the kids.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Excellent book, I never imagined it would be such a great story. I will definitely read the other books related to the silo saga.
B006WJ0332|4.0|I choose this rating because some of the episode was a little boring.<br />But other than that love watching it, too bad its all done and over with.<br />I would recommend it to my friends.
B003W04434|5.0|i wish this book was avalable when i started to learn to play . just outstanding and right on point .
B0073COMUW|3.0|Brightness is very good and at least equivalent to 60W but not too harsh.<br />Feels well built.<br />Too Blue for my taste--AND my Wife's but this is really my fault--it clearly states 6000 Kelvin which is on the blue scale.
1604595647|5.0|I must say this has to be one novel I won't forget.  I loved this story and I loved the way it was written - a true Victorian novel. It has it all, mystery woven all through it.  It was hard to put down - and you had to put it down because it was very long.  I did read mine on Kindle however.
0345803493|5.0|I love it so much I read the whole trilogy twice already. I hope E.L James continues the story line. It was an excellent book. I would read it again!!!!
B009LDD1X0|4.0|I really enjoy the Big Bang Theory... but to be honest with this season it really feels like the show is on auto pilot. Some of these episodes here are rather inconsequential in the scheme of things where as in previous seasons almost every episode felt like the piece of the overall puzzle. They really need to come up with something to goose the show out of it's somewhat submissive state. Again, it's not bad but the previous five seasons are just way stronger.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|The digital remastering is just wonderful.  The color and picture quality was supurb.  I watched the movie numerous times over the years but with the new details it is almost like the first time.  I am so happy I purchased the Blue Ray version.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I had already read &#34;Introverts in the Church&#34; (a different author), so this was a wonderful follow-up secular book.  I agree with so much of what the author says.  She does refer to evolution, but it is only a small portion of the book.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|The issue I have with the app is that the text is way to small and the pictures are way too large and overlap the viewing frame.  I have to slide the pics around to entirely see them and I've been all thru settings looking for a way to enlarge the font but, so far, I can't find anything that enables me to do so.  Is anyone else experiencing this type of problem?  Any helpful suggestions would be appreciated.
B000FBJFSC|1.0|This book was very depressing. I did not find the humor helped make the book an easier read. So sad.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|great show and I will buy the next season. It is enjoyable to watch when nothing else is on tv
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Finally a Steven King novel that doesn't end up with a clown in a sewer pipe in Derry. He flirts with the clown and Derry thing, but doesn't dwell on it.  I know it is fiction, but it is a well told story and will keep you entertained throughout.
B009K916ZK|5.0|I have used this adapter in my class for 2 years. Connects my MacBook Pro to any VGA projector with ease. The screen resolution is lower quality, but for presentations it is perfect.
B00BSZZA3I|5.0|This case is exactly what I was hoping it would be. It is authentic HTC product that fits the phone perfectly. The built in stand is absolutely wonderful. Only thing I'm not too thrilled about is there are no color options.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fantastic. I'm waiting for more levels!!! This escape game it's perfect, fun and not frustration during the game... please more levels!.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|This case fits perfectly. I am very pleased with it. My only complaints are that there is no obvious place to grab it that is comfortavle for long term holding. Also, and this may just be me that notices, my fire seems to get extra warm when i have it on for an extended amount of time. Maybe because it fits so well it doesn't vent like other generic cases do.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|I really dont quite know what to writ, yet I feel really pressed to do so after just finish that incredible film.<br />I'm no trekkie, but I truly enjoy Star Trek and have been for several years, and I believe J.J. Abrams recent Star Trek films are incredible additions to the franchise and do them the utmost justice.<br />Both the reboot films have made me cry early in, which I was not expecting upon beginning wither of them, and thats not something the older films did easily or often.<br />Suffice to say, I rather hope these can be continued to made with as much care and consideration as they have been.<br />Also, looking forward to J.J. Abrams direction of the 7th Star Wars film coming in a few years. I think, after watching these films, he will do an incredible job with it.<br /><br />EDIT: This review applies ONLY to the movie, and not the controversial dividing of special features going around.<br />I am disappointing in the fact that I cant see all the special features, especially the commentary.<br />The movie itself is 5 star, and a must buy, if you don't care about extra features. If you REALLY want extra features, then this version is not likely for you, as it only includes some making of sets and sequences clips, some prop design, little specific character talk, only relevant interview material about the sets and such. No bloopers, commentary, or much special effects here, mostly practical stuff. Not to say the included features aren't good, as they are, they just may not be the ones you are interested in viewing.
B00936A0RU|5.0|I bought this dvd used and not a scratch was on it when i recieved it. Thank you i love it!
B007SGM084|5.0|I love this story! I read all three books in just three days. I did not do anything else I feel sorry for my husband and the three days I was on vacation. but it was soooooo nice.
B0000524E5|5.0|Just another addition to the collection! I love movies! And I like to have them on DVD...it's where all the special features are!
B00CS74W0C|4.0|the ending of the story I wish was better it was a really great read but now I am thinking there may be another book. it was like the story ended but had so many unanswered question that you could not believe that that was the ending. I thought that something was wrong with my kindle but no that is where the book ends. Weird.
0812981448|5.0|I bought this book for my son's required summer reading for school. He had it read by the middle of June. It really made him think about how he could do things that matter for others. I feel it is a perfect book for teenagers to read. Most of his other required reading books are full of trash!!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I enjoyed all three books of the Crossfire series very much. But I was disappointed that there was no ending the fantasy ended so sharply and without .
B00A3NQNUU|1.0|Okay so I had a great dragonvale but then someone reset My kindle and I couldn't get it back. I was logged into facebook but it wouldn't let me sign back in. It did on my phone but not on here. Like I said,horrible!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My son loves this game. He plays it all the time and had previously played it at the sitter's house so he was so excited to have it at home.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|No movie is perfect although a lot of people expect them to be. I watched the trailers, read the reviews, then watched the movie....twice.... Great movie! So back to the reviews. The less stars a movie is rated, the more ignorant and sarcastic the review. Most people do not understand that a movie is not an exact visual dramatization of your treasured comic book. Comics have their place. Movies are a retelling with added fluff and certain license to create new thoughts, emotions, flaws, and each actor/ actress brings their own to the part. So... my advice, which to you one stars would be worthless, is quit screaming at your television trying to influence your quarterback to pass instead of handing the ball off for a loss of yardage. Instead of coaching from your couch, let them tell you the story they want, not what you had planned out in your head or wished would happen. You cant control life fully. Some things just happen. Tony's story just happened. Of course feel free to attend film school, sell your soul and move to Hollywood, then maybe someday you can produce your greatest work and have someone call it a flop.
B00C3UUZVE|2.0|The game didn't work on our Nabi Jr very well and it was just very hard for my 2 yr old to understand.
B00E3BK0QQ|2.0|This genre is my favorite. I've played ALL the games in this category. This one was good but definitely not worth 5 bucks. The graphics weren't very good. There ALOT of dialogue. And the inventory items were difficult to find and repetitive. I believe I had to find a hammer on 3 or 4 different quests. It's a decent game, but their are way better ones for less money. Plus, it only took me about an hour and a half to complete. Sorry G5, but y'all can do better than this!!!!!
B007JWKLP6|5.0|A detailed look at the life and personality of a beloved character to us Baby Boomers.  Loved it, think you will too.
B00AREIAI8|1.0|it sucks and i am going to delete it it is the worst game i have ever had and wont play it ever i mean ever again this is the first game i have had that sucked so much
B0034G4OYA|5.0|It is a great movie for kids and adults. My kids have watched it over a hundred times and they still like!
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|This game crashes all the time.  Very frustrating to play because it randomly freezes and I have to uninstall the application and start all over.  Please fix this game.
B008JFUO4U|5.0|wow this flick is gtreat I wish more were out like thses moives and it kept me at the tube
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I love Sudoku, and the best part about this is when you &#34;pencil&#34; in a number, it puts in order 1 2 3 - 4 5 6 - 7 8 9 in the boxes. Then, when you say, place an 8 in the correct spot, it immediately eliminates all your &#34;penciled&#34; in 8's that would conflict with that one. Genius, I dont have to go back and do it myself!
B002OSXDAU|5.0|I have read Atlas Shrugged when 2008 financial crisis was on its peak and amazed what Ayn Rand portrayed about the future world from 1950s. Now, I decided to read the Fountainhead and enjoyed every word of what Ayn Rand wrote. I think that this should be one of the must-reads for everybody.
B000I0XLYO|4.0|As long as you like \\"stupid funny,\\" Zoolander will entertain you. There are a few laugh-out-loud moments for me, even after having seen it several times. It is a parody on the fashion industry, but if you are looking for an intelligent take on making fun of the industry, you won't find it here. It doesn't reach the intelligence level of, say, Austen Powers. If you just want to laugh at silly jokes and the stupidity of the main character, this is a fun movie with a great ensemble cast for that purpose.
B000E5N62U|5.0|Typical Donald Fagan......Fantastic! Fantastic is the typical type of album Donald Fagan produces, so he's again come up with his typical offering.....Fantastic!!
158234082X|5.0|what an amazingly good, funny, and intriguing book. Anthony Bourdain really nailed what it feels like to be a cook and with plenty of hilarious and jaw dropping stories
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Such prose. I fervently enjoyed this classic literary work. Would highly recommended it to everyone. The story told from the po ok by of t he wolf is outstanding. Jack London is an exquisite writer.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|It's the movies in your living room.  Everything is cool about this movie--it shows how the Avengers got together and decided to become a team instead of individual heroes with all that ego.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Easy to learn and lots of fun.  Helps me to relax at the end of the day, thinking only about the game.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Funny New with twist keeps you on your toes. Great for busy time with the kids. It's a problem slicing game
B00935KWWO|1.0|I found it to be Multiple account-friendly, but NOT kindle-friendly. It causes routine crashes/ freeze regardless of latest update. The customizable face is a plus.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game on my computer and on my kindle. Now I can play anywhere and anytime.  My son likes to play bingo on here as well. I'm glad I found this app.
B00079FUI6|5.0|I give this 5 stars, because I not only LOVE the show, but everything (delivery, s&h, etc.) was perfect.<br />Anyone who buys this (or has watched it when it was still on tv), will absolutely fall in love with this hot guilty pleasure.<br />&#60;3
0307719774|4.0|My sister bought this for herself with the intention of filling it out, but once she received it, realized she had no desired to do so.  So I was the lucky recipient of her waning desire to track her years with words in this book.  I love it!  It's a quick little way of recording the days over time.  What would make this book absolutely PERFECT would be if it had one of those ribbon book marks that was attached to the book, so you could keep your place easily.<br /><br />I plan on getting my boys (ages 10 and 12) the Q&A for kids three year journals for Christmas, knowing full well that I will probably be the one writing in them each night as I chat with the boys before they go to bed.  I'm wondering if maybe the company will read this review and decide to put those ribbon book marks into the kids version before I buy them!?!
B0091REZMW|5.0|I love this game, keeps me busy in my free time. Graphics are really good and is very challenging and addictive.
B004UFEJS0|5.0|Very imaginative movie. My son and I really love this movie. We've watched this move a dozen times and still continue to enjoy it.  Movie night is here to stay. Popcorn please.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|it is a great game . I rate it a 4 star because it is not like the regular slender game but it is still a great game. buy this game.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|I really enjoyed watching UP with my son, who is 6 years.  We laughed, cried and enjoyed the movie.  I highly recommend this movie on a Friday night or a family night movie.
B00E9PXI3S|2.0|I love Rachel McAdams so that is why I was interested in this movie.  Well I am just glad I didn't pay to go see it in the theaters.  I actually was going to fall asleep mid way through so I turned it off and finished it when I woke up.<br /><br />I didn't follow the story at times and I found the ending confusing.  Perhaps I am just not familiar with this type of film, but it w disappointing.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|This was much better then first one. Some if the tasks I had to start over as there were glitches. I also didn't like the lights that went off around objects even if you had already used the object. Story line not very good but just skip the narratives
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I saw the film that was based on this novel. Then I read the book. While the  film adaptation was OK, and who doesn't want to look at Bradley Cooper for 90 minutes ?! (he gave a very good performance, btw),  the novel is much more satisfying.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I would just like the BBC to keep giving us great Masterpiece productions. The actors are great , camera work and lighting is beautiful.
B0039YZPZ4|5.0|I have seen this movie a few times, my daughter just watched it for the first time. Great flick and fun to watch.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Good book. Well written and hard to put down. We read it in book club but I think it is better suited for a younger audience.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Product was described as used but it was really packaged as brand new. Great value. Would definitely recommend and purchase again.
0061438294|5.0|The title sums it up. This is an excellent, in-depth work on observing body language, with real-life examples where the ex-FBI agent turned author describes how reading the body language of suspects both prevented and solved crimes.
B004X80QNG|4.0|Very helpful to have everything in one place, makes the work case easier to handle .I don't leave home without it.
B00CTT9646|1.0|I am a big fan of the movie and pre-ordered it once it was available. However after receiving my copy of the special edition and reviewing all the contents I feel a little cheated. Lets discuss what you get...<br /><br />The Movie: The actual movie itself looks beautiful and sounds amazing. You get a digital copy, 3D Bluray, Standard Bluray and finally DVD. I like when vendors include all copies in one box.<br /><br />The special features: Or rather lack there of. It comes with only a fraction of all the content available for this movie. Paramount purposely gave different vendors different content. The only way to get ALL of the extras is to buy it three times from BestBuy, Target and iTunes. This is extremely annoying because I purchased this \\"special edition\\" in hopes that it would be the end all be all version but you get more bang from your buck buying a normal edition.<br /><br />The Phaser: The phaser looks good from a distance but on closer inspection it is really flawed. It has some nice weight to it but there are many unrefined edges and details. When you look at the phaser head on you can tell its crooked in several places. It does not spin from stun to kill automatically, you have to turn yourself and it doesnt turn smoothly nor does it lock into place. The ends of the barrels are warped and just dont look crisp. You can tell that this was mass produced and slapped together to ship out and sell as much as possible instead of being a collectible built for fans.  I love movie props but this really left me feeling cheated.<br /><br />Over all I regret the money spent on this and would have probably enjoyed a standard edition from one of the other retailers more. Eventually the special features will be uploaded to the net somewhere and I'll watch them that way. Then movie studios wonder why customers would rather download something instead of paying for it.
1250030951|5.0|Ever read a book that you want to read again as soon as you are done? In fact you want to read it again so much you have to physically stop yourself and keep repeating over and over in your head that you have a million other books to read? No, never happened to you? Well then you have not read Fangirl. Because OMG did this book ever give me all the feels! Feels, feels, everywhere.I loved it so much I don't even know where to begin with the amazingness of Rowell's imagination and untouchable writing.<br /><br />Fangirl is the story of Cath, a college freshman with a love of all things Simon Snow, a popular book series she loved as a kid. Cath has been a fan of Simon Snow for so long she really doesn't know what life would be like without him. She reads the books, has the posters, is completely immersed in the Simon Snow fandom. So immersed she actually even writes fanfiction for the fandom. And through all the Simon Snow ups and downs Cath has had one person by her side and that was her twin sister Wren. But suddenly Wren is pulling away just as they are ready to hit college and Cath needs her around more than ever. Now Cath is on her own at school with a roommate that may or may not like her company and a boy that seems to always be around. Cath has always known where she has fit in with the Simon Snow crowd, has always had her place, but now she is out of her element and she must find out how to stand on her own and how to be herself.<br /><br />Seriously I don't think this book could have been better in any possible way. The story was perfect, the setting was perfect and the characters were perfect (in their flawed ways). Everything just flowed so naturally that the book was really hard to put down. Cath was such an interesting character that was stuck between growing up and staying in that weird place between when you aren't a little girl anymore, but not an adult either. She had had Wren to rely on for so long and then she was no longer there and Cath was, for alack of better words, lost.  The only thing she could rely on was her love and writing of Simon Snow. She was weighed down with such anxiety about everything she was pretty much paralyzed with fear and truly one of the most remarkable things about Cath was watching her blossom and break out of the shell she had put herself in. With the help of Reagan and Levi, oh Levi!, Cath was no longer Wren's twin sister or Simon Snow super fan and author, or daughter of a wayward mother and bi-polar father. She was finally just Cath, a girl that has a lot of layers that just needed help in showing them.<br /><br />Like I said Reagan, Cath's roommate, and Levi, Reagan's guy from high school, were hugely instrumental in Cath becoming the amazing person she was by the end of the book. Reagan and Cath couldn't have been more different. They were night and day. But even with these differences they completely complimented each other and had a really great friendship. And then there was Levi. Sweet, adorable, completely charming in a goofy, sexy way, Levi.  How I heart that boy. He was the absolutely perfect person to counter Cath. He was just so at ease with himself and his life and what he wanted. And the sweet things he did. SWOON! He is now on my list of book boyfriends, right at the top with Etienne St. Clair and Jonah Griggs. That right there says how much I love.<br /><br />Although there isn't much about this book I would complain about, there were two things that bugged me. Honestly I thought all the fan fiction was a tad over the top. I completely understood its place in the story and the need for it. It helped Cath be herself and to stop worrying about everything. It let Cath express herself in a way she just couldn't in real life. But I also found it last a tad too much throughout the book. I wanted more Levi and Cath or Cath and Wren or Cath and Reagan.  And I also hated the way Wren treated Cath sometimes like she was beneath her.  That bugged the heck out of me becauseit wasn't really called for. Was Cath clingy when it came to her sister? Sure. But she also was only trying to help her and do the right thing. Wren was way too mean. You could feel the love between them but I just didn't like her attitude.<br /><br />But even with those two minor things this book is still 5 stars and I loved it to the moon and back. Rowell is a master story teller. She gets her characters like almost no other authors in YA and she gets it down on paper in a way that is laid back and easy. I've read 2 of her books and fell in love with each one a little more. Rainbow Rowell is officially a member of my author auto-buy group. Welcome to the club Ms. Rowell.

B00F0N7JUG|5.0|The Collector's Edition of Pacific Rim looks amazing and the movie is \\"2,500 tons of awesome\\" as promised.<br /><br />The Plot: It is consistent and conducts the story's events very well. The writer, Travis Beacham, clarified some doubts in his Tumblr blog, but the movie show us everything we need to know to understand it.<br /><br />The Characters and acting: Likable and charismatic. Rink Kikuchi and Idris Elba steal the show but Charlie Day and Gorman Burn deserve a special mention too. They are incredible and funny.<br /><br />The Effects: Perfect. Both monsters and machines are as real as possible. Amazing in 2D and even better in 3D.<br /><br />The Soundtrack: Epic. Even if you didn't see the movie, its music will sound impressive.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect but any minor problem is easy to swept aside due to the visual spectacle presented to you. It is still in theaters as I write this review. If you have a chance to see it in the big screen it is a cinematic experience you deserve to appreciate.
B00ET7ICEQ|4.0|Although there are some songs on Sheryl's other post millennial albums that grabbed me on first listen  more than anything on here I think this is her most consistent work since her career highlights \\"Sheryl Crow \\" and \\"The Globe Sessions\\" in the '90s.There are several strong cuts and nothing is an embarrassment.She actually has some authentic country cred hailing from Missouri's bootheel.A stand out for me is \\"Waterproof Mascara\\" in which she seems to be channeling the late and great Tammy Wynette.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Well it is interesting. The power adapter looks exactly like the one for my phone. Which I kind of neat. I guess if I loose one I should be able to use the other but I have it plugged into the usb port on my blueray player. Which works fine. When I stream from my computer the audio does not go through my surround sound but when I stream through my ipad it does. Which I find extremely odd. Before I tried the ipad I thought my surround sound was not even working. I kept turning up the volume until I decided to try switching the tv to the Dish hopper. The sound was so loud I had to quickly switch back and keep trying down the volume. After that is when I tried the ipad and the chromecast was able to send the audio through the surround sound. I then went back to the computer and again no audio through the surround sound. No matter if I tried a youtube video or a netflix video or even a amazon prime video with silver light uninstalled. It does work though. I would just love it to work through the surround sound when using the computer with it.

140006922X|5.0|The book looks at the historical events of Jesus' time helping the reader understand why the gospel writers focused on what they did.

1416955070|3.0|I loved the book almost entirely. There were grammatical errors and run-on sentences. The book in itself was a different type of supernatural uniqueness. Altogether, I could hardly put it down, that is, until the ending plot twist where Clary and Jace turned out to be siblings. This to me ruined the entire book. It's bad enough that you could tell the main characters were falling in love with each other and had PDA involved as well. I couldn't stomach the ending knowing there was incest in the book. The author should have written that Valentine kidnapped Michael Wayward's son and changed their identity. I was so disappointed and I doubt I will read the series. thats really my only complaint and theres only so much incest I can take.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|The best Star Trek movie to date.  Edge of your seat action.  An all around great film!  A new twist to an old franchise, that still manages to stay true to the TV series.

B00CTSDDVO|3.0|Star Trek Into Darkness is a fantastic sequel to the 2009 film Star Trek. All of the actors do an amazing job, and if you are a fan of the 09 film then you will probably love this as well. The shipping was fast, the product arrived a few days before I expected it. I have yet to view the special features or the audio commentaries but I am sure they will be as fantastic as the film itself.<br /><br />The movie itself, is great, but what sucks is that I have 2 versions of this film (this and the Villain Steelbook) and neither have deleted scenes, and both are apparently missing a few special features.  This makes me upset that Paramount thought it would be a good idea to do this because I will not be buying another copy of this film just to get their bonus content.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|As an AP literature teacher, I was interested in this work as a recent Pulitzer Prize winner and because of its ambitious attempt to treat a challenging setting.<br /><br />As many readers suggest, getting through the early going takes a little patience and may even require you to retrace your steps once you become accustomed to the nature of the narration. Yes, the point of view shifts, but this is hardly a new concept. Cormac McCarthy recently did something similar to this to great acclaim with No Country for Old Men. Again, not a work for everyone. But not as difficult as some make it to be.<br /><br />There is sadism, abject violence, and an unrelenting sense of oppression that permeate this work. That sort of thing appeals to me, but I admit, as many reviewers confirm, it is not uplifting in the conventional sense. It is often gruesome. Though, I think there is a remarkable redemptive element to the work.<br /><br />One of the negative reviewers raised an impassioned and thought provoking complaint from the perspective of a Korean American. What right does a white author have creating a portrait of North Koreans and their culture? He suggested the author Americanizes his characters. I honestly cannot say for sure if he is correct about this, but it gave me pause. That said, it is a work of FICTION. As the author admits when describing his research, he had difficulty penetrating what may be the most sheltered and restricted culture on earth. The citizens could not even look at him, let alone speak with him, when he visited. But doesn't that reality resonate in the \\"storytelling truth\\" (Tim O'Brien) of the novel? This is not the REAL Kim Jong Il or the agents of his regime. It is a fictional character who bears his name. The novel offers a take on the mysterious cult of personality of the man who bore that name and ponderous burden that his party's ideology imposes on a nation. I thought he, the fictional character, was fascinating. On a side note, I frequently found myself putting this portrayal up against his parody in the South Park film satire, Team America, from several years ago.<br /><br />Put aside judgments about the \\"correctness\\" of the presentation of N. Korea and focus on the transcendent storytelling truths and you will find the essence of human nature stripped bare in this work. I found it increasingly engaging as it progressed and finally came together in the end. On the whole, very satisfying to me, and I think I will give this work a go in my AP class next year. I'm curious how students will receive it.

B009LDD54K|5.0|I've watched this show since the very beginning, and I LOVE it!  I loved the third season, especially the season finale -- &#34;Margate Sands.&#34;  Was glad when it finally came out on DVD.  I had the season finale on my DVR, and I must have watched it about 20 times since last December.  Watched all 12 episodes within a couple of days.  (I also own the first 2 seasons on DVD).  This is one show I will NEVER get tired of watching, and I hope season 4 is just as good as the others.  This show ROCKS!  Awesome cast of characters!  I'M HOOKED!!!
B005LAIH54|5.0|As mentioned by other reviewers, this movie is better than it's prequal, Clash of the Titans.  The actors are a little over-blown and over-act, but the action scenes and the animation are stunning.  If you like greek mythology and adventure, you will like this movie.  If you are looking for Science Fiction, you may find this movie corny.

B00AZMFJYA|2.0|J.J. ( Mini-Speilberg ) has done it again.  He has taken the original Star Trek episodes and some Next Generation, put them in a blender, and spilled out another movie that is more of a spoof than a serious attempt to stay true to the original vision.  I feel sorry for Star Wars fans, as I am sure he will fail there as well.<br /><br />Some movies that are ripped off : Raiders of the Lost Ark, Godfather 3, Matrix, True Lies, Revenge of the Sith, many others.<br /><br />Things that don't make sense:  Tribbles are common instead of some exotic lifeform found much later ( well apparently Tribbles are now the rats of the universe<br />thanks to 'Enterprise', so I stand corrected ), Khan can beam himself all the way to Klingon home world from an exploding ship ( wow! he's smart ), magic seatbelts, shooting phasers at warp is no longer a problem, and cold fusion apparently can freeze a volcano.<br /><br />All the attempts at some scientific explanation for all the things that happened in every previous episode of Star Trek was just thrown out the window.<br /><br />I watched the movie again and found more things, like how is Khan 300 years old in 2259?  I guess mathematics in this country is a serious problem...<br /><br />If J.J. and his crew had taken the time to just make the movie fit within the Star Trek universe, I would have rated it better than average.<br />But, I guess when the money starts flowing, nothing else matters!  He should have stuck with television.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|It is a wonderful series that would be an added bonus to my collection. I really appreciated the opportunity to start watching my purchase without any problems or issues. Love, love, love Downton Abbey.
B00BRUQ3PS|5.0|Echoing other reviewers, I too found it a satisfying end to the trilogy and a more gentle book than I expected. I looked forward to its release for a long time and it more than fulfilled my expectations. I can understand why some readers found it less powerful than the first two books but I absolutely loved it. All the dots were connected and then some.
B000059GEI|5.0|Don't be thrown off by Marilyn on the cover although she does have a significant role in the plot I wouldn't necessarily say she is in the main cast. The true gems to this movie are Ethel Merman and Donald O'Connor. Ethel Merman was the queen of Broadway that adds awesomeness to the film.
0984725113|5.0|Definitely sees automation displacing workers.  Good, economically valid set of recommendations.  Notes on content:<br /><br />(p. 31)  Growth in productivity (using GDP) does not count free services like Google, Facebook, Wikipedia, YouTube.  Nor does it include unmeasured quality of life increases, such a gains in human welfare from telephones, etc.<br /><br />(p. 74) When Bill Clinton convened a panel of experts to discuss the economy in 1992 no one mentioned the internet.<br /><br />Economic recommendations<br /><br />See concise list p. 65 on.  Some examples:<br /><br />(p. 53+)  Race with machines, not against them.<br /><br />(p. 56) Foster organizations which team unemployed, mid-skilled workers with machines to create value.  Example:  Amazon's Mechanical Turk, which allows people to sign up for jobs to be done online, and gives small companies and researchers an inexpensive and easy to recruit source of labor.<br /><br />(p. 61) Invest in education to create people who can innovate with machines (art, creative writing, leadership roles, team building, etc.)<br /><br />(p. 66) Teach and set up structure to learn entrepreneurship throughout higher education, e.g., teach practical business creation and management skills using today's technology, etc.<br /><br />Good ideas, only thing I would add is that the internet will provide solutions we cannot foresee to problems we can't foresee!

0786838655|5.0|The Lightning Thief by Rick Riordan would be easy to critique from a mythological point of view, as it is a modern retelling of the well-known Perseus myth. Yet the very fact that Riordan has managed to capture mythological antiquity in such a popular story for the modern child-reader begs itself to be studied. This can be done best, not by studying the adult myth on which The Lightning Thief is based, but by studying it through the Generationalist lens of its own cultural geography, and child-centered voice and language.<br /><br />Cultural geography can be described as the physical representation of a culture through the use of environment in artistic media. Geography professor Peter Jackson said in Maps of Meaning: an Introduction to Cultural Geography, \\"... [culture] is the level at which social groups develop distinct patterns of life and hence are `maps of meaning' through which the world is made intelligible\\" (Jackson 2). In Cultural Geography: A Critical Introduction, Professor Donald Mitchell adds, \\"The degree to which landscapes are made (by hands and minds) and represented (by particular people and classes, and through the accretion of history and myth) indicates that landscapes are in some important senses `authored'. Hence landscape can be seen as some kind of text\\" (Mitchell 122).<br /><br />The literal landscape of The Lightening Thief is modern-day America, with New York City being the primary setting. As a metaphor of American prosperity and might, no city is better suited than New York, the self-declared hub of the western world. Furthermore, the emblematic landscape of the story is based in the ancient Greek culture, an undeniable historic model of supremacy and prosperity. Like New York, ancient Greece has a reputation of decadence and power. As an historic metaphor of the western ideal, no culture is better suited than the Greeks, from whom modern-day western civilization received much of its innovations and philosophes.<br /><br />This landscape-union of two cultural giants is not an accident, as Riordan explains within the story:<br /><br />\\"You mean the Greek gods are here? Like... in America?\\"<br /><br />\\"Well, certainly. The gods move with the heart of the West.\\"<br /><br />\\"The what?\\"<br /><br />\\"Come now, Percy. What you call `western civilization'. Do you think it's just an abstract concept? No. It's a living force. A collective consciousness that has burned bright for thousands of years. The gods are a part of it. You might even say they are the source of it...\\" (Riordan 72)<br /><br />Children are taught of the prestige of ancient Greece in both history and English classes, and shown over and over again in popular media the might of New York City. The power-hub metaphor of the cultural landscape of The Lightning Thief is not lost on the child-reader, even if they cannot yet explain it in logical terms. However, what they do understand is the largeness of these landscapes. New York City is enormous and mazelike, both physically and as a lofty vision of \\"the big city\\"; the ancient Greeks are mystical and far-away, towering images of gods, goddesses and dueling heroes of old. Thus, the theme of chaos is personified for the child-reader within The Lightning Thief though the use of its cultural landscape. It dwarfs the child-reader; it is chaotic and huge - much like child-culture views the wider world of adulthood.<br /><br />Yet the voice and language used by Riordan in The Lighting Thief roots the child-reader within this world, so that it is navigable and relatable. It is simplistic, sarcastic, and often mixed with slang - a safety-jacket to hold on to through the chaotic \\"big\\"ness of its cultural landscape.<br /><br />The Lightning Thief is written in first person, with twelve-year-old Percy Jackson as the narrator. He pulls the reader in right away, speaking directly to them as a fellow member of child-culture:<br /><br />If you're reading this because you think you might be [a half-blood], my advice is: close this book right now. Believe whatever lie your mom or dad told you about your birth, and try to lead a normal life...<br /><br />If you're just a normal kid, reading this because you think it's fiction, great. Read on. I envy you for being able to believe that none of this ever happened. (1)<br /><br />Riordan directly pulls the child-reader into his world by making them a part of that world right from the first page. Percy himself is the safety-net. He is the gatekeeper and guide. Like the child-reader, Percy feels lost and confused in his world, even before he finds out that it is far larger than he ever thought:<br /><br />Am I a troubled kid?<br /><br />Yeah. You could say that.<br /><br />I could start at any point in my short miserable life to prove it... (1-2)<br /><br />Like many modern children, Percy lives with one of his biological parents, and doesn't know the other one at all. His stepfather is abusive, and he himself is awkward and always getting into trouble. By way of his character and voice, Percy tells the child-reader that he understands them, that he knows how hard it is to be a kid. Percy is searching for his identity, wanting to know who he is, and where he fits into his enormous, chaotic world. Finding out that he is \\"special\\" within that world doesn't make things any easier, as now on top of confusion and doubt, Percy is inundated by very real danger:<br /><br />\\"Nobody mentioned the hellhound, but I got the feeling they were all talking about it behind my back. The attack had scared everybody. It sent two messages: one that I was the son of the sea god; and two, monsters would stop at nothing to kill me.\\" (127)<br /><br />The metaphor of the child-culture fear of becoming an adult - of navigating through that chaos all alone - is apparent within Percy's larger-than-life cultural landscape of monsters and tyrants and evil gods, all who want him dead. Percy is understandably afraid. He is also sarcastic, often weak and small -just like the child-reader to whom he tells his story. Yet in the end he wins the power of self-discovery, a power which every child must use to successfully navigate the often terrifying, mysterious world of adulthood:<br /><br />Ares came toward, grinning confidently. I lowered my blade, as if I were too exhausted to go on. Wait for it, I told the sea. The pressure now was almost lifting me off my feet. Ares raised is sword. I released the tide and jumped, rocketing straight over Ares in a wave.<br /><br />A six-foot wall of water smashed him full in the face, leaving him cursing and sputtering with a mouth full of seaweed... I... lunged to the side, and stabbed Riptide straight down into the water, sending the point straight though the god's heel.<br /><br />Ichor, the golden blood of the gods, flowed from a gash in the war-god's boot. The expression on his face was beyond hatred. It was pain, shock, complete disbelief that he'd been wounded.<br /><br />... I was five steps away when [Poseidon] called, \\"Perseus.\\"<br /><br />I turned.<br /><br />There was a different light in his eyes, a fiery kind of pride. \\"You did well, Perseus. Do not misunderstand me. Whatever else you do, know that you are mine. You are a true son of the Sea God.\\" (330-346)<br /><br />By defeating the god of war - another allusion to adult-culture - and winning the pride of his true father - acceptance into adulthood by a revered adult - Percy proves that he is the ultimate hero in child-culture: the child who steps through the mystical portal into the vast cultural landscape of adulthood and survives triumphantly.<br /><br />Works Cited:<br /><br />Jackson, Peter (1989) Maps of Meaning: An Introduction to Cultural Geography: London, Unwin Hyman.

0375869026|5.0|The universal theme of Wonder by R.J. Palacio is acceptance. Social life is an enormous influence in child-culture, with children taking from it everything from their own self-identity to assumptions about the larger world around them. To Generationally explore this theme in Wonder through Palacio's use of literary devices such as Characterization, Point of View, and Tone is to explore the vitality of community within child-culture.<br /><br />Ten-year-old August Pullman, the protagonist of Palacio's story, is a child who stands outside of that vital aspect of his culture for reasons he has no control over. The story opens with his own point of view, explaining in a matter-of-fact way that he looks different than other kids: \\"I won't describe what I look like. Whatever you're thinking, it's probably worse\\" (Palacio 3), and his nervousness about entering fifth grade in a brick-and-mortar school for the first time after being homeschooled his whole life:<br /><br />I can't say I have always wanted to go to school because that wouldn't exactly be true. What I wanted was to go to school, but only if I could be like every other kid going to school. Have lots of friends and hang out after school and stuff like that. (Palacio 4)<br /><br />Wonder takes the reader through many of the basic storyline arcs of Middle Grade books before it, such as Beverly Cleary's \\"Ramona\\" books, and Judy Blume's Tales of a Fourth Grade Nothing. August goes to school, makes friends, makes enemies, dresses up for Halloween, goes on a field trip, etc. But because of his unique look, his everyday life becomes a stark metaphor of the inner-life of the child-reader, all of whom have felt \\"different\\" from one time or another:<br /><br />... suddenly it was my turn to talk [in front of the class].<br /><br />\\"My name is August,\\" I said... \\"I, um...have a sister named Via and a dog named Daisy. And, um... that's it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Wonderful,\\" said Ms. Petosa. \\"Anyone have questions for August?\\"<br /><br/>...\\"I have a question for August,\\" said Julian, raising his hand. \\"Why do you have that tiny braid in the back of your hair? Is that like a Padawan thing?\\"<br /><br />\\"Yeah,\\" I shrug-nodded.<br /><br />...\\"Who's your favorite character?\\" Julian asked... \\"What about Darth Sidious?\\"<br /><br />... maybe nobody else got the Darth Sidious thing, and maybe Julian didn't mean anything at all. But... [his] face gets burned by Sith lightning and becomes totally deformed. His skin just shrivels up and is face kind of melts.<br /><br />I peeked at Julian and he was looking at me. Yeah, he knew what he was saying. (Palacio 43-44)<br /><br />The fear of being the new kid, the terror of speaking in front of the class, the worry that you're different - all of these highly-relatable trials in child-culture are magnified in Wonder under the hyperbolic lens of August's obvious physical deformity. Thus, the child-reader relates to August on a deep, psychological level as being one-in-the-same.<br /><br />But then Palacio takes the story beyond the mind of the ostracized victim of societal prejudice. Wonder is unique as a Middle Grade book in that the original narrative voice changes throughout the story, as Palacio switches viewpoints from August himself, to those \\"normal\\" people effected by Wonder's place in their own lives: his sister, his friends, even his sister's boyfriend. With each change in point of view, the child-reader is given a glimpse into their own prejudices. After showing the child-reader a relatable protagonist, the story offers this new idea to children -- who often think in terms of their own sometimes imagined or overinflated slights: what do you do when you aren't the one being ostracized? This question is perhaps the most apparent when August, dressed in a mask on Halloween, overhears a conversation between some of his classmates who don't know he's listening:<br /><br />Julian... was talking to two mummies who must have been Miles and Henry, and they were all kind of looking at the door like they were waiting for someone...<br /><br />\\"... Actually,\\" said the mummy, \\"what he really looks like is one of those shrunken heads...\\"<br /><br />\\"I think he looks like an orc.\\"<br /><br />...\\"I've thought about this a lot,\\" said the second mummy, sounding serious. \\"and I really think... if I looked like him, seriously, I think that I'd kill myself.\\" (Palacio 76-77)<br /><br />It turns out that the second mummy is August's best friend Jack. August is, of course, mortified, and as a member of the socially-dependent child-culture, the child-reader feels this keenly as well. But later in the story, Palacio gives Jack's point of view on the situation:<br /><br />...And then all of a sudden this picture flew into my head, this memory... Someone in homeroom had dressed up as a Bleeding Scream costume on Halloween...<br /><br />Oh, man. It was August!<br /><br />...I was so mean. I don't even know why. I'm not even sure what I said, but it was bad. It's just that I knew Julian and everybody thought I was so weird for hanging out with August all the time, and I felt stupid...<br /><br />...I felt like I was going to puke. (Palacio 152)<br /><br />Jack has done something horrible and he knows it. He can't take it back, and he can't give excuses for it. Just like August, the child-reader has been angry with Jack up to this point. Yet when Palacio shows Jack's thoughts on the subject, the child-reader is faced with their own actions and reactions to those who may be different in their own world. Would they do what Jack did? No, of course not. Except maybe that one time...<br /><br />By tackling the ever-present theme of acceptance in child-culture through the use of established literary devices, Wonder epitomizes the vital role of literature as a mirror to our own world, the thoughts that guide us, and the emotions that spur us.<br /><br />Works Cited:<br /><br />Palacio, R.J.

B005XQLBU4|5.0|it is really fun and keep me moving... one thing is that they are cheap with giving repair points... hopefully an update version will be more attractive
B007JF87VS|3.0|I saw season 1 and 2 so far.<br /><br />Season 1, was great with a good story.<br /><br />Season 2, is waste of time. The group sits around the farm all season and cries about their personal problems. It is an extremely boring waste of time.<br /><br />Seson 3, I'm told season 3 is as good as Breaking Bad. I sure hope so, because season 2 sucked.

B00D8HNR5W|5.0|I never much enjoyed old NIN like a lot of fans, really beginning to be a fan myself with Year Zero. Much like Year Zero, this album is extremely listenable as a whole, from start to finish. Unlike Year Zero, as well as all of Trent's work since The Downward Spiral, this album is deeply personal, reflecting on his feelings about his fanbase, the music he makes, the confusion over the need to live up to his own past accomplishments, and his journey through life. Utterly beautiful and fantastic album.
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I didn't  think I would like this game but I do. I can't seem to put it down. It makes me want to compete with my friends, to se if I can pass them.

B002FQOI0A|5.0|an great book for 10 and up this book is about a girl who is gettiing some mistirius notes from an anonomous person
B002MQYOFW|5.0|im not a reader but i could not put this book or the rest of the series for that matter down!
B00A0HQ7H8|5.0|I am in love. I have never heard music like this. I get chills with some of her songs, while driving. Her music is that good.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|I do not know what genre you could place her in. She can stand on her own, I feel the music is that great. The music takes me away and gives me goose bumps. It makes me happy to know there is still imagination and talent out there such as Lana Del Rey.
B00EOFJAT4|5.0|I feel the song, her voice is amazing, and it has a unique sound. Every one I know that has heard this song loves it.
B00BRUQ7ZY|2.0|Silly me!  I thought there still might really be an original word to be written about this very special man who inspired a &#34;religious cult&#34; of his own.  But -- while this book DOES present a lot of historical insight into what was going on in the wider world during Jesus' lifetime, the author constantly reminds the reader that Jesus was such an insignificant blip on the radar during his life (no surprise there, he was a carpenter who made very little impact on anyone or anything until he hit the road & started preaching his gospel) that NO-ONE knows much of anything about him.  This piece of work presents nothing new by way of speculation, educated guesses, or even wild imaginings about Jesus of Nazareth.  Worse yet, there are many segments that get so deep into the writings of the gospels that they are almost mind-numbing.  My view of Christ is that he DID exist, that he DID preach & teach & touch many hearts & lives, & that he was, at rock bottom, a rabble rouser who irritated the pants off the people in charge but had a VERY serious impact on the nature of world religion.  This book would SEEM to back that up -- but it does it in the most prosaic, non-dynamic fashion.  In fact, it's a bit of a bore.  VEry little new here, & so far as I can see, NOTHING new about Jesus the Zealot.
159514188X|5.0|I received my book fast! Just in time for my class work. No damage was made to the book. It is brand new.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|I found this book to be amazingly unique and devoid of the sluggish pace and lack of excitement found in other fantasy works. The characters seem pretty real and the book is a joy from cover to cover.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book is fantastic.  The story is gripping.  It makes you want to keep reading until you are finished.  I love all the characters and how the story develops.<br />Great read.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Blu Ray Post Production on STID was done so well, my 10ft wide projector screen looked liked the quality of my 55\\" Sony LED TV.  Image detail and depth was jaw dropping, beautiful saturated colors with easy to see dark image detail.  I can see every blemish of a Blu Ray movie on a 10ft screen and I was mesmerized by the quality and the attention to detail they did in post production.  Finally, a post production effort done by people who really understand movie envelopment.  Must buy.  The acting was very, very, very good.  This is the first movie where I've seen tear drops from all the leading actors (protagonists and antagonists) eyes timed to the crescendo of various emotional scenes ... looks real ... could be CGI ... nonetheless, very effective.  6 (yes, six) stars out of 5!  J. J. Abrams Rocks!!! looooooool!
B000002NIW|5.0|From start to end, all killer songs, very melodic and heavy. One of the best albums to come out of the 90's.<br />If you are not familiar with Deftones they were discovered by Korn. They have a similar low tuned guitar sound but are more metalish and have a more straight forward approach. Very original band. killer cd!
B002U0KHMY|5.0|Really like how they  start the series. It leaves you wanting to know what happens next. I recommend this series.
B005CRQ4XI|4.0|Entertaining as well as thoughtful and soul searching. Cheryl tells an honest account of how much the human spirit (and body!) can endure and over come if we would only \\"stray\\" out of our \\"comfort\\" zone.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Always enjoyed Uno and this app makes me love playing even more. You need go earn or buy gold coins to play or wait 45 mins to Scratch for coins. Otherwise a fun, exciting game. I love it.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Awsome. Cant stop playing. I love playing this game. You just keep going in order to do better. If you want fast pace fun?? This is your game then.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Of all I've tried, this is the BEST. I most like the voice alert feature notifying battery % level. I recommend it highly to every and anyone.
B004GYY714|5.0|This is a great app. It does what it says it will do, and it does it well. Highly recommended.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Preparing for a trip to visit my southern roots,  I took on the reading of this novel.  It was easy for me to picture the plantation setting from memories I have  of southern plantation homes I remember visiting in Arkansas.  I did not want to put my iPad down, hoping for some thing positive to come to the heroine. I enjoyed the anticipation to the final conclusion but disappointed the author left much to our imagination on what happened after the story ended. That is another book.  Recommended to those interested in history of plantation life in the south, pre civil war.
B003EYVXSW|2.0|I wasn't sure what to expect when I decided to give this a view, only that it was going to be some kind of sci fi movie that had to do, by the obvious title, with genetic engineering.  Brody and Polley are two scientists at NERD (no it really is called that) who are working on an experiment having to do with genetics.  After literally splicing all sorts of DNA under microscopes and growing them in petri dishes, a new creature is made.  After their experiements with the two worm protoypes, Fred and Ginger, go horribly wrong, they end up with some other creature thing which Polley names Dren.  Attempting to keep her existence and her rapid growth a secret from others, she is hidden in an abandoned barn while Brody and Polley fight over the morality and legality of their creation.  It turns into kind of a humanoid thing with occasional wings and a stinger tail, and they're not quite sure what to do with it.  And, inevitably, things will go horribly wrong.<br /><br />It's the same kind of Frankenstein story that's been around for the last two hundred years or so in literature as well as movies, the ending was predictable.  That one scene (and you'll know which one I'm talking about with Brody and Dren) is disturbing, but not quite as disturbing as those of Species I or II.  It was ok, not great.
B000Q99EAC|5.0|Rocky films tend to get a back rap, and that is not altogether undeserving.  The first film, by itself is a classic, and that is perhaps how it should have remained...as one film.  Yet, more were made, and II compliments the original enough and III pretty much rounds out the story in an exciting way, but then the error occurred.  They went all in with IV and made a superhero film, and V was a mess - trying to put all the formula of the original film together, and it is horrible on so many levels.<br /><br />Then, years and years and years later out comes \\"Rocky Balboa\\" and it is a wonderful film, with its harshest critics being those persons who have never seen it.  This is age appropriate Rocky - old, retired, running a restaurant, still a part of his neighborhood and beloved my many, who, after a computer bout with a modern day contender is able to enter into a \\"let's see what will happen\\" match.<br /><br />The beautiful aspect of this film that it fits well both as a sixth film, but even more so as a direct sequel to the original.  It has that same quieter feel of the fighter finding his way back into the show biz spotlights.  The story is told in a believable enough way that one does not have to stretch too far to see how the old guy could fight the young one.  The character of \\"Little Marie\\" is back (though a woman now for sure) and becomes the love interest.<br /><br />If you are looking for superhero antics, this is not that kind of Rocky, but if you want a great film, with good pacing, characters, and a look at state of boxing today, I recommend \\"Rocky Balboa.\\"  Since it was released it remains one of my favorite films.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|This App is will give you the best sound on the Kindle Fire. I love the fact that you can use the equalizer and the other settings to always get the best sound and when you do, you can save it and name it for reuse. It works when playing from the device internal storage or from the cloud. Buy it, learn how to use it and enjoy yourself. I know, I listen to classical music and all my MP3 recordings sound so sweet.
B00C5WR6JE|3.0|I WAS DISAPOINTED WITH THE MATERIAL CHOSEN FOR THIS ALBUMTHERE WAS NO STANDOUT TUNES,VERY FLAT AND BELOW HIS USUAL GREAT WORK.
0802473156|3.0|As with all relationship books, BOTH parties have to buy into program. I would replace 5 loves with 5 places: one on each side of bed, one in bathroom, one on breakfast table, and one in the car.<br /><br />Unfortunately, my other couldn't decide what language she was, or changed it, forgot about it, couldn't be bothered [denial] or just didn't want to go along with mine.  It requires an everyday awareness -- like exercise. Should be able to explain what you want in 14 words or fewer-- or never succeed ...<br /><br />Nice ideas, easy to understand, &#60;200 pages ... but requires serious daily effort/awareness by both parties to work.
B001NLL93W|5.0|Good book. Keeps you turning the pages to see what is coming next. Enjoyed reading this book and the rest of the series.
B0058BI896|5.0|Fun, funny, cute, and silly! Several of my favorites are in Season Four. Here is to the geek in all of us!!
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I like this book as well as I did the rest of the series. Keeps my interest and wanting to keep reading till the end.
B00AAQVSDW|5.0|I purchased this album last week for my husband. We have both listened to it none stop in our vehicles. Most of the time you but an artist album and listen to one or two songs, NOT THIS ALBUM. This album is so good, you will be listening to every song on it over and over again! I really like 'Tell me how you like it' ;)!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I started it and couldn't put it down. Had to get the rest of the series and keep reading them all.
B00C061I3K|4.0|Purchased largely on the basis of a couple of songs and was pleasantly surprised how enjoyable the entire CD is.

B0001I561E|5.0|My grand daughter and her mom loved the movie. It was a present and she wanted to watch it. Great price too.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I am a prolific reader, one who will read just about any genre. However, I still am quite picky and if a story does not grab me within the first few chapters, you could say I'm pretty much done.  I don't rely on reviews and I have never felt the need to write one until I read the very last word of \\"Orphan Train\\".  For the life of me, I can not tell you the last time a novel has sucked me in the way this one has and for once I was not disappointed to come to the end of a story - it was that satisfying and a truly \\"full circle\\" ending.  I will not go into the details of this novel because others have done so, probably much better than I can, but I will say that if I were to name the best book I've read in who knows when, upon pain of death (well, maybe insurmountable pain), I'd have to name this extraordinary novel by Christina Baker Kline.  I'll be sure to try her other novels, but I'm afraid I've been spoiled...
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Piper feels like a best friend as you read her book. You feel for everything that is happening to her.<br /><br />I truly enjoyed this book!
B000LN7HUC|5.0|I bought this stove back in June. I have used it on a couple of camping trips so far. It performs great, consumes little fuel. I was using soda can stoves but wanted something more sturdy. This thing is built to last and performs better than my homemade stoves. I have introduced it to a couple of friends who have ordered there own after seeing how it performs. Not much more I can add with all the other reviews here.
0399159347|2.0|When an author needs to write an epilogue to justify book's raison d'être, it's a sad state of affairs. Skip it
B0060MYM7O|5.0|The picture quality is superb. I also thought there were some very nice special features in the set. I can't wait for Season Three!
B00005N6KG|3.0|I buy one of these every year.  They are cheap, but effective.  Recommended for light use, but they are pretty fragile.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I often don't play this unless I need a stress realized. This is a great game to relax. You need to like slow paced games.
B000002HO3|5.0|Simple Red is one of those 80's groups that will never grow old. Mick Hucknall's soulful voice is right up there with the great legands of all times. All the tracks on this album are awesome, so I cannot single out a favorite, but if pressed.... I'd say \\"Fairground\\" one of the least known songs. Every CD collection needs this album to make it complete!
1426308469|5.0|This book is just amazing. My son has got into dinosaurs watching Dinosaur Train on PBS, and this book perfectly complemented that program. He was able to name some of the dinosaurs from the program when he saw then in the book.<br />The book has the dinosaurs organized by their size, reserving the gigantics for the end. that kept the excitement going until we reached the end. now he wants to start all over again.<br /><br />well worth it! pictures are amazing too!
B008IJT0CE|5.0|great control the only that would make it better is if they allowed you to import. your own music as it can get repetitive at times
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Hate how you have to upgrade to get more things! I use this every morning to get up.<br />One of the best alarm clocks ever!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I loved this book. it was on of the best books i have ever read!!! it has shocking moments but are amazing!!##
B005544V6A|5.0|A cut above the rest in every way.  You can't help admiring these two rascals and wishing you were there with them for the kill.  Their greedy adversaries never see it coming.  I pays to think out of the box.
B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Come on, you can't expect this to be as good as the original, but if you're a die hard fan, you must watch them all. I recommend it, because I love John McClane!
B0067Q42BY|4.0|Mahjong with an adventure. More interesting than a regular mahjong game. Pretty fun! Good for kids too. Something different to enjoy.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|Come on, how do yo not like Ford? This is a great set of movies. I highly recommend them! Love!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This Game is totally worth it I only bought it at 3.99 but it is still worth getting it now
B002OR0RP0|5.0|This is a great series. I haven't watched the newest, but this one was great. Good for kids and adults.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Great for doing something when your spouse is driving cross country and you're the passenger. Fun time for little money.
141659521X|5.0|This was one of my favorite of his series.  Stayed up well into the night, I could not put it down.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Author has a lovely writing style and gives great advise and tips on proving to yourself that you control your own life experience.  Highly recommend to anyone interested in gaining more understanding about the idea of co-creating your experience.
1594135851|5.0|Just like the first book in the trilogy I could not put it down.  Can't wait to watch the movie. Love the ease of reading and hope to read more from this author!
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This book was filled with descriptive emotions, real feelings and at times frightening depictions of what is next.  Felt like I was having a conversation with the author in person. Loved her detailed accounts of her various acquaintances and bunkies. A story of meeting your punishment head-on and accepting the consequences for the crime committed. Wondering how this experience can make for a better person; however it was all in the attitude and doing what had to be done in the best way!
B00F3LDAQM|5.0|\\"Persuasion\\" was Jane Austen's last completed novel.  Like her other books it is, on the surface, a romantic comedy, but the underlay is an acute social analysis of class and gender.<br /><br />Her novels are not really feel good stories at all but subtle and sharp analyses of these more complex themes in middle-class society in early 19th Century England by an enormously talented exponent of great writing and wonderful dialogue. All this enhanced, in this edition, by well chosen vintage illustrations
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great, easy to use......and u don't have to search for your calculator :) I needed an app like this to use while doing daycare paperwork and this is perfect for  my needs!
B004TMPJP6|4.0|This is one of the best apps I have ever gotten. It took a little getting used to the various functions, but once I got it, I loved the versatility.  And it's great to have this available on multiple devices so if I need to add or show an item complete I don't have to do it for each device, it syncs up with all the changes. In my case I have this on my Kindle Fire and my Android phone. So I can create or edit a list at work on my phone and have it on my Kindle completely updated.  I strongly recommend this to anyone that likes to stay organized and wants it to be simple. Many thanx to the developers!
0545265355|5.0|I bought the series once upon a time, lent it out to a bunch of friends, couldn't wait to read it again so I bought it. Love these books and the set is lovely.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I love the extra long length.  It charges and quickly.  I would buy this product again if needed.  No problems.
B00E00RB5I|5.0|Glad to see EWF back on the music scene again. I love the mix of jazz and R & B. My favorite songs on this album is \\"Got to be love\\", \\"Love is law\\" and \\"The Rush\\". The melodies are great. \\"Night of my life\\" reminds me of the 80s.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|OMG!!  This show is the best show I have watched for years!  I am hooked and can't wait until season 4.  LOVE IT!!
B00F35BV64|5.0|Awesome.  The special effects and acting were superb.  In terms of production, there were a few abrupt transitions that could have been smoothed, but excellent job overall.
B004Q3UL2O|2.0|I've passed over renting this movie so many times. I wish I had passed today. The acting is forced, the relationship is unbelievable. It's a basic movie with basic one dimensional characters. Total bummer.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This is one of the most heartbreaking (true) stories and is depicted with compassion in this movie.  Actors portrayed the family with so much emotion and love...can't imagine what it was like living through it.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This was such a good story. It was cute, funny, and even devastating at times. I really enjoyed it. It was a short book, but made me laugh and cry, which is good enough for me. :)
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is right up my alley. I thought it was going to be like all the rest and bore me after the first 20 mins.
B009ZQFSRA|4.0|Kind of dark, but overall a good movie.  Good acting and storyline.  Would recommend to friends to watch if they ask.
B004JC16LC|5.0|I can say that the transfer in this box of the famous 1953 Ring is one of the best I have ever heard - deep bass but lots of air around the voices as well. Worth getting for that alone
B002JXK5VU|5.0|Good show.  Reminds me of some of the shows that used to be on that were about alternate dimensions and such.  Would definately recommend to friends that have not watched.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Possibly the BEST movie I have seen in the last decade. Don't know why the \\"professional\\" reviewers said it was a horrible movie, it's just the opposite.<br /><br />  WATCH THIS MOVIE!<br /><br />YOU WILL LOVE IT!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|some of the levels more challenging than the others had fun playing it. thank goddness I didn't pay for it.
B00CLT31D6|4.0|Great book.  Well researched with great statistics to back up their claims.  It's a little dated so you need to keep inflation in mind when looking at the dollars, but the themes age well.
B009G41CG2|2.0|It should give me hints option or shuffle. It doesnt do neither so if i get stuck and can't find one, i have to quit and start over.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|This was a surprise to me as to how much I enjoyed this movie.  The dads in the park scenes were awesome
B009GX7IRA|5.0|it's Gibbs, what else is there to say.<br />I missed the season, so I have been renting them to catch up with out commercials.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|this app does all it says its going to do.  I like the way you just push a button and either turn on the camera light for the LED on the front screen. the different colors is a fun option as well great job.
B00DHRLK84|3.0|I think my subject says it all.  I - like many of you out there said &#34;really, Brad Pitt in a zombie flic?&#34;  So, you had to ask yourself...WHY?  Trying to cash in before the latest wave of Zombie exploitation waned? Maybe Brad just wanted to be in a Zombie flick since he was a kid?  Maybe he thought this would bring light to the ever increasing need to establish a greater network of health related anti-viral and research facilities around the world?  Maybe Angelina just wanted him to do it.  Anywho- the movie is a trod and weak.  Sorry Pitt lovers.  The Cg was marginal and acting matched.  ...oh, and that was in the theater, not on small screen.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|my son asked me to download this for him, but its a bit too complex for him to get the idea just yet.  i played for a bit, and its decent.  overall, its a very good app.
B00932A4XE|4.0|This was a good movie and as a mom of three, I was able to relate to the characters and situations.
1592289444|2.0|I found this book in a basket of free books and read it straight through.<br /><br />The first part of the book, dealing with Rawicz's detention in the Soviet Union and transfer to a work camp in Siberia seems plausible, although it drags a bit. The bulk of the book concentrates on Rawicz and his companion's escape from north of Lake Baikal, through the Gobi Desert, Western China, Tibet, the Himalayas, and their eventual rescue in the eastern part of India. This part of the book is absolutely fascinating, but, I'm afraid it didn't exactly pass the \\"smell test.\\" There were too many implausible events, many of which have been commented on in other reviews. It is those implausible events that make me want to believe the story, but ultimately, I cannot.<br /><br />I can believe the escape story and the scenes of traveling through Siberia, eating deer, and sleeping in an unforgivable climate; however, traveling for two weeks at a time without as much as a drop of water in the Gobi Desert does not seem possible. The group had two bouts of living with no water for more than ten days at a time and limited water the rest of the time through the Gobi Desert. It did not ring true.<br /><br />The story involving Kristina, a 17-year-old Russian who escaped from a prison camp and coincidentally finds the group of men traveling with Rawicz, seems more like fictional plot device than a real character. Kristina takes the hard edge off the men and allows them to have a sense of civility during their journey.<br /><br />Their travels through Western China and Tibet seem a little more plausible, but they also seem like the fantasies of a Western colonizer being greeting as a hero among natives. Rawicz and his friends are showered with accommodations, food, and gifts on their journey through Tibet. Along the way, the men coincidentally meet a \\"Circassian\\" who speaks flawless Russian and lives in Tibet. The \\"Circassian\\" serves to help the men get back on the right track and, again, doesnot ring true.<br /><br />The trek through the Himalayas does not seem likely either. A small band of men, dressed in the jackets they received from a Siberian prison and carrying only small backpacks filled with animal dung and one axe between them, could probably not cross the Himalayas. Fortunately, they meet a Himalayan sheep herder who actually winters with his sheep in a cave for five months of the year.
