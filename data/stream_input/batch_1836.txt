B0050DIWFC|5.0|This is a book that in reality is a story of our times. Mental illness is an issue we really need to deal with. We need to start taking better care of our society as a whole and stop being so greedy. This nation is not about us as individuals, but it is about how we care for one another. We are failing at teaching our young people the value of life.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The great writing, gives a great escape into the fiction :) The purchase was reasonably priced and simple to complete.
B000XXLY6I|4.0|Great looking boots, but they run very large! I normaly wear a 10.5 however these boots were huge. I returned for a size 10 they fit better but still require heavy socks. I am happy with my purchase and would recommend these to a friend.
B009HELT3C|4.0|I've enjoyed all of the Men in Black movies and felt that this one kept that energy going.<br /><br />The rental process through Amazon also worked out well for me; I watched the movie immediately, however, so I can't comment on how well the 24-hour nature of the rental process works.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|although the first disk had really bad pixellations, the replacement disk played nicely.<br />the 3D effect is not as strong as Captain America.<br />however, the video and sound are very nice.<br />:)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|All I can say is wow. Wish I was watching from the start. It keeps you wanting more every episode.
B0043WHRWA|5.0|I've only seen seasons 1 and 2 prior to this and this season was way more action packed than the other two.  I've gone back and rewatched several of these episodes which I rarely do.  They're that good.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|I am hooked on this series.  My wife complains because I have been reading this and books 1 & 2 and not doing my chores!<br /><br />Read them all, you won't be disappointed, unless you are a romance novel reader, although there is romance in these too.
B003THJA1G|5.0|I absolutely love the humor and characters of this show and watched every episode one after the other.  I couldn't stop.  Very compelling.  The video quality on my XBOX through the Amazon Video On Demand app was excellent.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Humor relied on the uses of adult language. For those that enjoy “Family Guy”, Mark Wahlberg voices are identifiable. Found the store line is weak and lost interest halfway through.
B003TH2LYY|5.0|Does a good job of continuing the story from the first season and it's evident that the Castle/Beckett relationship will be an ongoing series of missed moments and opportunities.  If you liked Season 1, then Season 2 is for you.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I like it, it is a great tool. It does exactly what I wanted it to do.It is also very easy to use.
0802473156|5.0|This work gives a wonderful understanding of the necessary communication in relationships.  It may not fix the communication, but gives a great starting point for opening communication.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved the twists and turns and character development.  Interesting psychology of family interactions and personality types .Suprise ending was Really a surprise, too.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The time and setting of this novel coupled with the life described is not a place or circumstance I've experienced.  The simple human virtues of the main characters is very appealing.
B004EKCNMA|4.0|Well done Disney!  I enjoyed this version of the Christmas classic, but would not recommend it for small children.  There were parts that were just as scary animated as they were in the George C. Scott version.  Please don't assume that because it is a Disney movie that it is appropriate for all ages if your children don't like to be scared.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I think he is one of the most talented performers  of late.  The CD has a lot of different moods of music on it.  Enjoying.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie.  I haven't seen the movie yet but enjoyed the book.
B0091LS07E|5.0|Very enjoyable, easy listening, a very nice addition to my CD collection.  Will enjoy it for many listening hours. Thanks
B0076DELIG|5.0|I chose this rating because I love all the Michael Connelly novels.  Consistent with his earlier works, he simply  is the best!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|wont read the feeds, please fix this. only reads 10 feeds and then turns blue. very frustrating and facebbook needs to look into fixibg this problem.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|After learning that this series won so many Emmy's, I decided to check it out.  Watched the entire first season on Amazon and found it was extremely well made.  The acting is clearly superior to most current television productions and the pacing is ideal for carrying viewers through the story.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|love it expcialy like the chandge with the red bird and other birds any new stage coming soon!!!!!!!! awsome game
B009FZFONO|5.0|well on the old kindle you did not charge hd . 199 for hd is not right so I was not happy paying 2499 for season 3 when I got all the other season with he for 1499 so why did you change us those crazy price for hd please realpy about this o yeah . season is get  jessica
B0098VXBIA|3.0|My pregnant wife and I rented this from Amazon Instant Video on a recommendation from one of her friends who said it was an amazing movie.  Basically, it's not an amazing movie.  It's just ok.  This is one of those movies that follows 3-4 separate couples/story lines and none of them are especially gripping.<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT 1*****<br /><br />One of them loses a job and pretends like they will be really hard up because of it, and in the back of your mind, you're thinking \\"this actor/actress would never know what it is like to lose their job and be hard up for money\\".  Maybe that's just me, but it was annoying me personally which was a distraction.<br /><br />There was just one story line which kept me interested (and a reason for the rating not being lower), and that is because of<br /><br />*****SPOILER ALERT 2*****<br /><br />an event where one of them is no longer pregnant.  I find that despite not being able to relate to it specifically, it brings up the emotion and difficulty one would likely face in such a circumstance.  That particular story was more appealing/interesting than the others, but everyone else might find one that reaches out to them more than the others.<br /><br />Now the many different story lines felt more like their attempt to fill up minutes to make it long enough for a movie.  I definitely would not have rented this if I knew that it was such a movie (2.5 stars might have been a better rating if available).<br /><br />I also gave this movie a (benefit-of-the-doubt) 3-star rating because my wife enjoyed it some, and even teared up during a scene.  It might have a little something to do with her being pregnant so it's closer to home than some, but I don't even think she would necessarily go out of her way to recommend it... She just doesn't regret her time lost watching it like I do.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|it was very good book can't wait till May 26 when last book comes out so overall it was a good book
B00884GR0W|1.0|I bought this thinking that it would be a nice builder but then I once I started exploring I got A little fridend who kills me everytime I respawn want my money back
B00846REIS|5.0|it was a very good book I told slot of people to read this book so I thought it was well play out
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|The big keys are great, but it isnt much more than a basic calculator. Because its free I can't really complain.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Really interesting characters that the author is not afraid of messing with. Loved every chapter, couldn't stop reading until the very end!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|I read one of the reviews here on Amazon.com, purchased the DVD, and my daughter loves it! This is another one to add to her collection of DVDs (disney princess, fairies, barbie).
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was pretty cute. Kind of cliche as far as these sort of books go, but it is such a quick read that the few laughs in it are worth it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|My daughter loves this movie, ever since the first time she saw it. Since she liked it (and since I get her plenty of DVDs, mostly fairy, disney princess, and barbie DVDs), I decided to purchase it for her before the DVD was released or sold here.<br /><br />Since she received it some weeks ago, she watches it with her mother and myself. This is her latest 'favorite' DVD!!!
1400049628|5.0|Ok.. This book would be a perfect guide while your on the run trying to KILL/Escape\Survive from a Zombie. It provides what to do with food and shelter god I think this book is just amazing for people that loves zombies..... Especially me. I am kind of a Prepper!! I have 62 guns in the house ad an underground warehouse full of weapons food, bullets, Shotgun shells , snipers and much more if you guys need any help come over I will HELP
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|The movie itself is good, especially towards the end. Overall though it could have been shorter, or maybe we felt that way because the movie kept stopping midstream to buffer. It was very annoying to spend $5 for a movie that would freeze or fall out of sync every 15 minutes. I don't know if it was our internet or amazon's site. Either way I think we'll stick to the &#34;free&#34; movies offered through the prime membership.
B0086700CM|4.0|My kids love the game.  You must have excellent hand:eye coordination. My is not so good but I love trying to play anyway.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This game is a combination of ho and puzzles with an interesting story line.  It plays smoothly on my Kindle Fire.  I'd recommend it.
1580176941|4.0|very easy to follow instructions and colorful pictures. Lots of good ideas for different occasions. Can't wait to start baking.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|An excellent episodic series that keeps your interest from episode to episode. The acting is truly superior and the settings remarkably reproduced. Maggie Smith is priceless in her role as are all the other actors.
B009OYTAL8|4.0|We like this up to date Robin Hood style series.  It ties modern times and super heroism into a nice little bow.  We enjoy watching...
B0039N74CW|5.0|Who doesn't love the original tale of Shrek. My one and two year old think that it is so funny and love watching it frequently!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Like Flynn's other novels, I just can't put them down.  Recommend the series to anyone! Look forward to his next.
B0018QBAXG|5.0|If you haven't seen &#34;Fly Away Home&#34;, rent it. If you haven't seen it in years, rent it. If you saw it yesterday, rent it again. It is *that* awesome!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Kept my interest all through the story.  Good light reading.  You really wonder if this could happen to you or not.
B000024IJV|5.0|I saw Dr. John play Mamaroo on Boss City when I was a kid, and it has stuck with me all this time.  Brush up on your pidgeon French to catch the references in the lyrics of these songs of 'Nawlins.
B00A23MVHA|2.0|I expected a lot more from Mark Wahlberg. Even though there were one or two funny lines, this movie was very disappointing. If you can find humor in a prostitute pooping on the floor and really enjoy stoner movies, you will probably love this movie. Personally, it's just not my type of humor.
B0002Y69NG|5.0|The Matrix changed my life.  It changed the way I perceived my environment, and helped me unplug some of the cultural inputs that were distorting my thinking processes.  Having the collection in my collection is necessary.
B004V5QWU2|5.0|I turn this on every night before I turn out the light.  I love, love, love the &#34;Rain on a Tin Roof&#34; sound, but there are lots and lots of others that are also good.  I like that I can program it to play for as long or as short as I like before automatically turning off.
0300169787|5.0|Thank goodness someone published this book for those of us who could not go to New York to see this exhibit.  He was a brilliant fashion designer, unique and never to be competently copied, even though they try.  The photos are beautiful and large, the text is minimal. There is a short bio at the front of the book that is only about 10 pages long, if that, which is probably enough for this book, which highlights the beauty of his garments.<br /><br />The YouTube videos of his shows are fun as well.
B009LL4LMM|5.0|A cute little Jellyfish bouncing around, add a hat and you get some extra Awesomeness.  Surprise of the day when I got this.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Each time I purchase a Vince Flynn Mitch Rapp book- I think it will struggle to meet the intensity and intrigue of the previous stories....This, latest, book is truly up to form and I great read. It kept my busy during a business trip involving long plane flights and airport delays. My only complaint is that I ran out of book- before I ran out of travel- Keep it up a well worth read- Even if it still bothers me what they charge for an e-book.
B0087EVHTE|5.0|Now I haven't bothered with settings or anything much, but it definitely holds up no matter what i'm doing. It's fast and doesn't bottleneck my GPU, which is all I really care about.
B0079TQHDO|4.0|I always enjoy Jeffrey Archer he is a true story teller. Now waiting for the 3rd part of this trilogy
B002HMHROQ|2.0|Although the CD was in great shape, I was expecting to have the cover of the album as well.. Buying this cd from you has become as useless as downloading a *** version of this record online. You're lucky your even getting 2 stars..    Pieces
B00AMBM9MO|4.0|I enjoyed the movie. I found it very funny.The language was a bit on the rough side but I thought it was fine.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Still exciting with good chase sequences (esp. the motorcycle romp through Manila).  Integrates various bits of the Damon films and leaves options for future films that might combine Renner, Weizt and Damon (along with the other characters from the Damon and this film).  The Stacey Keach characters' goverment position (and Norton's too for that matter) are not really explained.  I'm guessing they're part of DOD but that isn't clear.  Human performance modification is the big aspect here.
B008OE05IG|5.0|Jiro is one of the finest films I have seen.  Very sensitive and beautiful treatment of an exquisite subject, a man of highest standards, supremely devoted to his \\"art\\". Every aspect of the sushi restaurant trade is examined in a fascinating manner that could well be a successful documentary on its own. I am giving this as holiday gifts except to people who have already seen it a couple of times.
B007URVZJ6|4.0|this is a good guide for publishing on Kindle.  I am a bit of a computer newbie, so all the help I can get I will take.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|I liked this movie a lot.  The acting is excellent.  Both Meryl Streep (as usual) and Tommy Lee Jones did a superb job in portraying their characters.  The movie was humorous and yet very poignant at the same time.  I glad I saw it and would see it again if given the opportunity.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|The potential for this book is great, but the author’s lead character did not make me feel like he was serious. To many wise cracks and to many jokes and (funny?) quips for this reader and for this genre.
B001JI72AI|5.0|Great movie. Brings you back to a time when America had a goal in mind and simply went after it.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|Exactly what you'd expect from a Bond movie, which is always somewhat more disappointing than you'd expect. If you want lots of action, with car chases, assassinations, unbelievable chases of all sorts, this fits the bill.
B0069UP2PI|3.0|I was looking forward to seeing the chemistry of the cast and was let down. Great individual actors that weren't able to show their abilities. Good subject and I liked the cinematography.
1781164150|5.0|We loved the movie and now we can see how it was dreamed up. Very inspiring for young artists, actors and directors who aspire to create in any medium.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I am a big fan of this movie. Love the literary references used throughout and how accurate many of the references were. I agree with Owen Wilson's character that Paris is the most beautiful in the rain. Loved the cast other than Rachel McAdams. Does she have to be insufferable and unlikeable in every role she plays?
B009CPJHY4|5.0|I would love to see all these outstanding actors continue this lovely story in a series. So many good messages and interesting stories to tell...
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|This movie is the best movie ever. It is my favorite of all times. I have watched it about 20 times and will watch it again.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|Great voice with great music....i love the rendition of Over the Rainbow..many others were so good too.. You will love it.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Good read, relatable characters, quick read and fun. I would recommend this book, i was planing on reading the next one.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I didn't watch the series when originally aired on PBS, but I have thoroughly enjoyed it through Amazon streaming. The acting, costuming, drama, and intrigue all equal a memorable viewing experience. I can't wait for season three to be aired in a few weeks!
B0036BK6MW|5.0|Inspired by SB's character's courage and strength to lead the family and care for a boy in need to such an amazing extent.  Great interplay of racial and socioeconomic tensions.  Makes me want to make a greater difference in people's lives outside my family.
B000UZ4OYS|5.0|The title says it all:<br /><br />Pros:  Jose sounding great on vinyl.<br /><br />Cons:  The vinyl came in the right cover, with the right insert, but stamped as the single &#34;Sugar Hill&#34; by A.Z.  Is it &#34;Sugar Hill&#34;?  No, thankfully, it is not.  Actually, now that I think about it, having my album stamped as &#34;Sugar Hill&#34; is a pro, as this is likely to deter any vinyl thief from taking this album.<br /><br />New Con:  Downside, if the zombie apocalypse comes, and per Shaun of the Dead, we're throwing records to fight the zombies, I could in the heat of battle accidentally throw this record thinking it is really a vinyl single of &#34;Sugar Hill&#34;.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Worst app for facebook I have ever used. It only loads the first few news feed posts in full, the rest are abbreviated and shades in blue with no accessibility to comments. It is better to just use the web browser and delete this app from your device.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|I don't know how any of these books are on new York times best seller's list. Author repeats scenes and \\"sayings\\" over and over.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I have seen and heard about this game for a long time and had to try it.  I have played it many times now and have to get used to getting the correct angle.  Try it and I'm almost sure that you will like it.
B0052OSTOS|4.0|I enjoyed this one the first 5-10 times I used it.  I have now moved on to something else but it was a great beginning point.
B008K8VDPU|4.0|I seen the commercial with the piano and had to have it..  Not as easy as it looked but it did just as one would think.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I enjoy this game a lot, passes the time when I'm bored and keeps my mind sharp.  Definitely worth the $5 I think.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Fun game. Freezes up on the kindle a lot. Seems to take awhile to get points racked up. Good for passing time or just something to do.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|On the new HD kindle the news feed after about 10 of them you lose the older feeds and can't see them.  Was on the phone lest night for over an hour and it was not resolved.  Why did I spend the money on the HD kindle for it not to work.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn has developed this character so much that we fans all feel like family. Great book and read it within a week.<br /><br />Found it to be a bit fragmented and felt that some character motives were not developed adequately - would have loved an extra 100 pages for the story line to develop further. However as I am a junkie fan - bring on the next one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|The beginning was slow and disappointing but it allows you to get to know the characters. I enjoyed it once I was able to fully get into the book.  Fell in love with the warpped relationship.
B00006JSS8|5.0|I love the seventies.....and this just made my collection even better.  Happy with this choice-did have two of my fav's on this CD.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|you have to continue on to Book two to see where the whirlwind relationship takes you.  You (I) couldn't help but continue to follow the couple.  Couldn't wait to see what would happen next.  Edge of my seat.
6304696515|5.0|Exactly what I was looking for.  Great Price. One of my all time favorite movies!  Thanks so very much!  Happy Holidays.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|to see what would happen next. Anna and Fifty had me bitting my nails to see if they would fix the issues they battled. Loved them hated them but couldn't stop reading. I would follow them into book 4.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed this novel.  Mr. Grisham did a great job of feeding us the main character's story in small bits while building the drama of the story line.  I was surprised at Mr. Grisham's seeming apology in the Afterword about not researching the story adequately and such.  I found the story quite plausible and a good read.  I recommend this novel.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Excellent movie, full of action. Fits right in with the whole Bourne franchise. If you liked the first trilogy you'll like this one. Jeremy Renner is a good choice.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|I enjoyed this tale of Reacher as an MP.  It helped me understand the Reacher character better than I have in the past.  I made the error of reading his current Reacher novel a couple of years ago and then reading the Reacher series in order starting from the first novel.  I encourage Lee Child to tell more Reacher MP stories.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Before \\"Old Man's War\\", I had never read John Scalzi- now it is a must read- anything from short story to full series: instantly addicting! John Scalzi is a genius at Sci-Fi and his approach in \\"Old Man's War\\" proves it. Don't miss any of his other books- they further support the idea of a new super-star in science fiction (which may become science-fact before you know it!)
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|Good movie. Could have done more at the end, but good. Good story line, not one of those boxing or wrestling movies that there are so many of. Keeps your interest. I really enjoyed it :)
B0091QSNEE|5.0|I bought for my twin 3 year olds. It's a great game. Keeps them busy for at least an hour. They love making things and like to watch me cook so this us a great tool to help them learn. Well worth the money.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|It was a great movie. i can watch it over and over again. Denzel is one of the greatest actors to ever live.
B006CHML4I|4.0|the WEIGHT of the watch is a bit more than I expected - all else fine, especially its self-winding NO battery feature
B00005OMTT|3.0|I loved it at first when I heard someone elses copy.  I finally got my own and just wasn't as excited as I remembered.
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|This is a great show, well done . Best entertaining show outthere. I just love it! A+ 100% !!!!!! must see
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I love this book so much. This is my 2nd time reading and its just as good as the first!!!
B005P5TQPU|5.0|This is a great show, well done . Best entertaining show outthere. I just love it! A+ 100% !!!!!! must see
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love how this movie inspires young women! I bought this for myself to share with my daughters and grand-daughter when they visit.
B008133MDK|5.0|This is a great show, well done . Best entertaining show outthere. I just love it! A+ 100% !!!!!! must see
B0035V35PI|5.0|Enjoyed immensely. Hardly buy disks anymore but had to have this because it just is such a good movie I had to own it.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Stands alone. This is a great show, well done . Best entertaining show outthere. I just love it! A+ 100% !!!!!!
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I gave it a five star because I watched the whole thing and didn't get bored.  Renner is interesting, which is more than I can say for most of the actors nowadays and Weisz ... well as usual, she doesn't have enough screen time.  She nearly steals the movie.
B00AC8ZJPQ|5.0|I really hope this becomes a series, it was well done and action packed. A look at the future like this is a great entertaining show.
B00A2BTCTC|4.0|The Surround sound mix & stereo remixes are excellent, but 30$ extra just for the hard bound comic book edition??? I have buyers remorse!!! I'm a pretty big fan dating back to the early 80's, but the less costly Deluxe version probably would serve most quite well. That is also what I paid for the Moving Pictures BD-A. Maybe this is open for debate, but the additional material is hardly worth the extra $$$<br />Even the Clockwork Angels hard cover novel is only 17$<br />Also the odd sized case will make storage in my collection awkward.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This is a great show, well done . Best entertaining show outthere. I just love it! A+ 100% !!!!!! must see
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Love this show :) It's such a weird thing to think that I would like a show about Zombies! But...the story line is great, and I love the characters. The only reason i didn't give it 5 stars is because I could do with a bit less gore, some of the episodes are really over the top in violence (like the one where they are overtaking the jail) but it didn't stop me from watching the episode, although I did cover my eyes many times! All in all, great show. I watch it with my 15 year old daughter, but won't let my son watch at 13.
B00632HWOG|1.0|I stupidly upgraded the Yahoo app. It doesn't work. Now I have to check my mail old school. Am thinking of switching to another email site like google or hotmail.
B0076DELIG|4.0|&#34;The Black Box&#34;<br /><br />This was an excellent Harry Bosch.  Classic.<br />This is one true fans of this series will like very much.
B009HELT3C|5.0|This was our favorite of the MIB series.  Not only was there more thought provoking moments, but a few touching surprises as well.
B007SGM084|5.0|WOW!!  I finished all three books in a 5 day period - couldn't put it down!  Well worth the indulgence.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Hard to put down and keeps you engaged thru the entire book. Would suggest that others read it if the like this style book.
B00A2IUHM6|4.0|This movie is obscene Indescent politically incorrect and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. If you don't like this movie you have no sense of humor.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Very good book, well written. Would certainly buy other books from this author. Great writing style and kept you interested.
B000Z45PEC|5.0|This is a great buy for BTTF Fans. This came in great conditions, and on time. I have the Delorean from BTTF part I which I got at Universal Studios but did not get the ones from Part II (they did not have the one form Part III) and these are the exact one that are sold there. Great Buy. Exactly as in the described in the product Discription
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Not as deeply written as a teaching document--that is, more of a soap opera than a historical novel that deals with the subtlleties of the times.  I hope that he takes more time to research the content of the final in this trilogy since it deals with a time in history of which I am familiar.  &#34;Winter&#34; is worth reading; just a bit disappointing.
B000256TD0|5.0|This is a great buy for BTTF Fans. This came in great conditions, and on time.

B009NT0I06|5.0|I know that I will make a hIt with this Christmas gift, just like Taylor Swift!!!  The recipient frames favorite album covers to decorate a room.
1250006341|5.0|Bought this for my mother for Christmas, I may have to order myself one. It's a fabulous inner look at the fashion, culture, class expectations, etc of Downton Abbey
B008BM9L72|5.0|I think every woman can read this book. I enjoyed reading this and it makes you think of what other people are doing. The romance and the story line is good and it keeps you on your toes. It is a book that you cant put down because you cant wait to see what is coming and what is going to happen. Loved it!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My daughter really enjoys this game.  She got a kindle for her birthday-and was so happy to be able to down load this game for free.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|this is the first Steven King book I have ever read. It was so good, right from the start. It is not gory or bloody like I thought his work would be. It was a quick ready even though it was pretty long.  I like the characters and everything about the way he writes.

B004O4K4SQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite games for android of all time. I always come back to this. It is perfectly challenging. Still havent quite beat the last level on the hardest setting after over a year.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like to play Solitaire on my computer, so I downloaded this game for my Kindle so I can take it with me.  It is easy to read and I like it very much.  I recommend to anyone who likes games, especially since it is portable.
B0086DBE62|4.0|I'm an adult and I thought this movie was cute. I'd watch it again. Julia Roberts is great, as always.
0307474259|2.0|Ok so this dude goes on this rant for 3/4 of the book about how being fat isnt due to caloric intake and expenditure. Which he comes up with some great points. But WTF is the point of writing a book that has no real revelation. He basically suggests for you to stick to Paleo and Ketogenic Diets. WTF?!?!?! Thats nothing new
B004XVMCMQ|3.0|I like the actors chosen for this version but it hardly follows the book at all. If your'e expecting the book, don't. If you're just looking for a good period move, this is great. I understand using creative license to bring a story into the present, but this one goes a little too far for an adaptation. Enjoy the romance scenes and write it off as a nother Hollywood mess up.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I love the Walking Dead!! It has evovled into something that has a twist and turn at every corner!Im on the edge of my seat while watching it.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Best thing I have read in decades - honestly. I'm not the dedicated reader I once was, but this set of stories can't be set aside to read later. I have to mow through it as fast as I can.
B00899F0G8|5.0|Started watching the the show recently. Now I'm hooked! So happy I was able to find Season 3 through Amazon Instant Video. Now when the show starts back up on Jan 7th, I'll be ready and all caught up with this crazy good series!
1554072840|4.0|I sent this to my great niece, we used it on our children some 25 years ago and it still is very helpful. She was so intriquged by Prudence and always wanted to talk about her. Wtihin a week she was in big girl underwear. Not sue how much this book played a part or if she was just ready.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Suspenseful with a good twist. Clever dialogue and interesting characters. Connelly books always hold your attention with enough comedy as a counterpoint.
B008XG1X18|4.0|A little slow on my Fire at times even when no other apps are running in background, but an overall great app. I would recommend this app.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|This movie is great. Funny as hell. Not for kids. The bear is the funniest also the narrator. Mark wahlberg is great too!!
B009YJEKJK|5.0|It's not Grease.  Very mild, light Christmas album.  Not fancy, nice.  Sort of like the old Steve and Edie albums.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|This set is great. The look of each movie is absolutely incredible, especially for the original movies. Highly recommend this to anyone who loves Star Wars.
B009GEDP26|5.0|The HD download was &#34;perfection&#34; all the way through.  My wife is not a fan of streaming or downloading onto our Tivo Premiere.  You all at AMAZON have it all down .. as a science.  Thank you very much !!!
B008NB0SQO|5.0|We have always loved this version of The Christmas Carol. Being in Blu-ray makes it all that much better. Buy it....
B000002KCF|5.0|like burcfield nines this was one of those cassetes that i wore out it was very exciting to be reunited with his work
1451695195|5.0|Absolutely riveting! Dr Alexander's well thought-out insights are written in a readable style that is both captivating and heartwarming.He is obviously erudite, having used his intelligence to produce this book, which may well change the world.
B007HACDLK|2.0|Did not match up to other<br />Mitch rapp books<br />Usually more mystery to them<br />Hope next one will be better
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book with great depth in the life of a seal and the world they work / breath/ live. Must read!
B0086700CM|5.0|I don't play this game but while driving, this is 1 of several games that keeps my son occupied instead of bothering me while I'm driving and he seems to be getting better at it each time he plays.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This book is great I could not put this book down it was a great great success future dickens seriously
B004LFO0ME|5.0|not a fan of rap music but my son seems to be fascinated with wiz, therefore this is the only way to get him up in the morning and we have a copy of this CD anywhere there's a CD player
0451197968|5.0|Trying to describe this book to my sister whose presently reading a sci-fi & discovered I had never written a review of it (my way of remembering what I've read).  Well, here goes (something, anyway). Loved this dark exciting action packed book!  Would never have dreamed it would be something I loved...tho I did love the early Stehphen King works. There are so many great story summaries on amazon's review page...read them for a feel for the book.  Yes, the movie is crap, the book is great.  And the many years ago I read it, there was no spoiler in the beginning...not in the book I read, anyway. Higly recommend.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Couldn't put it down and have now read the second book and about to get the third one. I totally recommend it for the romantic at heart.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I really like this movie. So good for boys and girls. Basic theme of movie is that girls should not have their lives planned and controlled for them and should have freedom to decide just like boys.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Momma got a new phone and stumbled across Minecraft in the play store.  Our 7 year old just loves it!
B008DM4OTA|5.0|This game is awesome I love it even thou it is primarily for children but me and my 4 yr daughter play this game together all the time since I downloaded ot
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Game play for this game is much faster than playing on my desk-top.  The only thing missing is the tournament portion of this game.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|If a friend had not told me not to give up when I first starting reading, I might have.  Very interesting to see into the prespective, of how it was written.
B0049J0CTM|5.0|We really liked watching this again after 10 years.  And we are 40!  Much better than so much of the crap that Hollyweird puts out.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|Great movie - fun to watch as an adult and great for kids.  Some parts may be a little scary for kids under 4.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|a must-have for every star-wars lego fan and every collector... and the price is just right with so many pieces and so many mini-figures...
B009HXG9UQ|5.0|If you liked The Darjeeling Limited or The Life Aquatic you will not dislike this film. I thought the movie was very well put together.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I liked it because it kept my interest and I wanted to know what was next.  I really got into the characters.
B007BT0RKG|3.0|I am not sure I have this product.  It does not ring a bell, so it does not appear as though it impressed me, if I received it.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|This book should be a part of everyone's book list at some point during their lifetime. I am forever a different or I should say awakened because of it.
B000YHG72E|5.0|The Elf movie is great and Will Ferrell is awesome in this movie. It's a perfect family Christmas movie. Fun, exciting and very cute.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|This product stops functioning every time I start my Kindle Fire. Be very careful prior to purchasing this item. Good Luck!
B0047Y17P2|3.0|The book held my interest and is quick reading.  Not too much else can be said about it although I preferred it The Lincoln Lawyer
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|The brand of humor is way too predictable if you are already a fan of Seth MacFarlane. So, this movie is best suited for people who like crude slapstick and have never seen Family Guy.<br /><br />Otherwise, as some other people have mentioned, they use up 2/3-3/4 of the jokes in the trailers.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|A good sequel to the prior movies.  If you liked them, you'll probably like this one.  If not, you'll be disappointed!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Great action and suspense!!<br /><br />Unbelievable stunts from the IMPECCABLE TOM CRUISE!!!<br /><br />Awesome unpredictable ending!! A must see movie.<br /><br />Impeccable movie!!
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Appears this is a &#34;retirement party&#34; for some of the current players.  Much like the latest Bond movie.  The action did slow down some which is understandable since the movie is close to 3 hours long.
B004GYY714|3.0|I love listening to my fave radio station online. Tuneln is easy to navigate, and searching is<br />easy for your station.  However, I've had issues where TuneIn has froze or lost the station<br />and I have to kill the link and restart it.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|An unknown western lawyer was chosen over three experience rivals to lead the nation in it's most trouble time.  Goodwin's story of this man and the nation's great fortune to find and select him is the best opportunity for  understanding Lincoln and the role he was destined to play in the war between the states.<br />Many historians have tried to write this book but until now no one has.<br />Despite the depth it flows very easily.  A joy and a revelation to be had by all.
B005MMYCY6|4.0|I liked the ensemble cast - Joseph Gordon-Levitt does a great job.<br /><br />In the end, it is actually very touching. you just have to stomach the brashness of the Hesher to get there.
B000SW4DXK|5.0|We LOVE this movie.  We have been watching it every year since my daughter was very little.  We had it on VHS and our machine quit in the last year.  Couldn't find it on DVD is stores so turned to Amazon.  Got it is just a couple of days and now we are able to keep our Christmas tradition alive!!!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|It was very detailed and has a good starter i loved this book it was amazing and ut could actually picture it
B008D28HYS|5.0|I love this game.  It is very fun and you have to use your brain! A lot of the time you do not know what the image is going to be until you get toward the end, which keeps it interesting.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I can not fairly create a review for Angry Birds Star Wars, but can surely warn anyone with a Kindle not to use the Amazo App Store.  I have had a hit and miss issue with it the last two years.  After having problems, yet again, now with Star Wars, I went to the \\"help\\" page and made sure everything was clicked, etc, in all of the right spots, they were.  After trying to retreive it again, it asked if I wanted to buy it, even though I was using the device on which it was purchased.  This is now a total of $64.27 that I have spent on apps that do not let you install them on the kindle.  Just wish someone had posted this warning before I had bought it.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|This doesn't just have good acting, but the music is exceptional.  Great film and well acted and put together.  A must see for all.
B0095ZMMCK|1.0|This is so far from plausible it borders on a comic book, complete with super heros and a batman story line.  i couldn't handle anymore,just when you thought it couldn't get any worse it does.  I quit and moved on to something else.
B007BLCGNU|5.0|I don't know how this movie rates as far as being historically accurate, but it was a good film.  I'm glad we rented it instead of buying it because it's the kind of film that you watch once and then you can say &#34;been there, done that and bought the t-shirt.&#34;  Both my husband and daughter were grossed out at the gay parts, gay as in homosexual and not funny parts that is.  I didn't watch the film myself because it's not my kind of film.  They only watched it once and were glad that they did, but they had no desire to watch it again.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|I love Zafon, absoultely adore him and he delivered again with Prisoner of Heaven. Only critique is it ended and I want more!!
B009CPE424|5.0|I got this for my young daughter and she loved this film and has watched it many times.  A great film especially if you have seen the others.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Loved it all the way through? Very entertaining and they made Bain look pretty freaking evil so it made for a captivating watch
B009SQRC9E|5.0|My kids really enjoyed this movie.  It's a funny Christmas movie for children ages 2 to 99. perfect for the whole family!
0446619078|5.0|Keep those books a-comin', Mikey!  What can I say further--you are one of our favorites.  Waiting for the next one!
B009D5VNLS|5.0|I bought this film and really enjoyed it which is odd since I don't watch a lot of films and I'm not a fan of cartoons either.  But I loved this film.  It's cute and I also enjoyed the Scottish accent of the characters.
B000SQFC18|5.0|A great movie brilliantly directed and written.  The photographic look of the different stories is masterful.  One of the great modern movies to be released in the last few years.
B006T9Y278|5.0|I saw this movie when it first came out but I decided that I needed to own this film so I also bought it.  It's wonderful as I love movies in that time era but it's just flat out an excellent movie that is very believable.  The music is excellent as well and it's a must watch for anyone who loves that time era.  Renee Zellweger is my favorite character in this film as she plays an interesting part.
B008476HBM|3.0|As always this is an amazing book but this version was a pit disappointing. Certain words were left out which would make it hard for someone who has never read the book. For someone who is familiar with the book this isn't a huge issue especially since its free.
B000ITF86E|5.0|If I could only watch one film for the rest of my life I would have a hard time picking between three film, and all three are John Wayone films.  This is one of my absolutely favorite films.  I LOVE IT!!!!  It's got everything between all the characters that makes a film fun to watch!
B0055QYKQO|5.0|This is one of the best motherboards Ive ever had.  Overclocking is so easy.  My PC screams now.<br />I love it.
B006RXPY3C|5.0|I really enjoyed this film as I enjoy pieces about the royal family like many others.  I like how they used actual film footage for this movie which made it even more realistic.  I believe how they made the Queen was how it really went, although no one knows for sure because their private time is their private time.  The characters even &#34;looked&#34; the part which helped a great deal.  I bought the movie and I've watched it multiple times and I'll continue to re-watch it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|This book was amazing, it had me sobbing through the whole thing. I would definitely recommend it!  I couldn't put it down either, so happy I bought it
B008K3HRF0|5.0|My kids wanted to buy the DVD in the store but I suggested that we get it on amazon prime instead.  I'm so glad that we did.  The kids watch it often and it's nice they can click a button and watch it rather than have to worry about scratching a DVD.  A great film with a lesson for young and old.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I'm sorry everyone. I wouldn't care how the acting was, I love the marvel comic characters and loved this movie. I thought the acting was great. The action was awesome and I also bought Iron Man 2 and all the others including the Avengers.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|my 12 year old son loves this movie, he's got all the other Men In Black movies so naturally we had to buy him this movie as well.  He's watched it several times already and I'm sure it will be watched many more in the future.
B001KRVLCI|4.0|liked the action and I really like both of the actors.  Was a tad far fetched but then, it's a movie!  I don't look for errors, I look to be entertained and I was!
B003SI84D6|5.0|I love western films and this one did not disappoint.  Wonderful film with great characters and awesome acting!  If you like westerns this is a must see film.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I purchased this right after seeing Merchant in concent in Portland, Oregon.  This one will be played as much as Blind Man's Zoo.
B008A1NSTG|5.0|I rented this film because it was one that I wanted to watch.  At first my kids weren't too thrilled with it and they didn't even want to watch it.  But in the end they ended up watching it with me and they also enjoyed the film.  A true heart felt movie that you can get involved in and enjoy!
B00633W614|5.0|This book just grabs your attention and doesn't let go. I read it in 2 sittings and enjoyed very minute.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|this app stinks. is slow and slows my phone down decreasing my productivity. Waste of time! Do not bother with it!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Michael Connelly  makes Harry Bosch seem like a living person with warts and all.  He makes mistakes. He works cases the old fashioned way, but uses his younger, more technical friendly partner to do the &#34;magic&#34; background work for him.  I usually can't put the book down until I'm done and this was no exception.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Everyone wants to believe this could actually happen, someone could love you past your good looks, and young body. It's nice to see it in film and dream of the possibilies.
B000UZNRS2|5.0|If you've longed for the end of Carter Gray & Roger Simpson (books 1-2), read this book... you'll find yourself virtually cheering that characters of Carter Gray & Roger Simpson finally reach their demise. Check it out!<br /><br />If you've never read a Camel Club (series) book, don't worry about reading the other two before you dive into this one... Baldacci will bring you along. Enjoy!
B004SBX112|5.0|Lots of variety with this game, spend more time than I should playing. Some of these can really frustrate you when learning what each bird is capable of.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Baldacci has done it again! Each of the Camel Club series is commendable, but I found this one particularly enjoyable. I expected for Baldacci to bring a final release for Oliver Stone at the end, but he left it open in my estimation.... sequel? Maybe.... either way, I'd probably read that one too! Very enjoyable read... if you liked the other Camel Club novels, you'll love this one too..... highly recommended.
B005DOJ68K|4.0|And this album is one of them. Liked this group then and still like them now. Most of their best is here with the almost 12 minute &#34;heard it through the Grapevine leading the way.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101-in-1 games is fun and challenging. my kids lobe playing it.I only have one problem they should make the games a little easier because you get stuck and can't open another game. that's my review for 101-in-1games<br />.  hope u like the game bye.
B00632HWOG|1.0|Since the 12/2012 update, my yahoo mail app is unusable. It doesn't load half the time and when it does it freezes as soon as I do anything on it. If I try to delete emails, it says they're gone then crashes and my inbox is full again. This update is crap! Please fix it!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Gave this book 5 stars because it is excellent and a great read, I could not put it down.  True Clancy form!!
B0026IWNZ4|5.0|I haven't received my order yet but I know the movie well. It truly is one of my favorite movies ever. It's really quite sophisticated ; mote than you would expect from a talking pig movie. It was nominated for best picture when it came out in (1997). Just a clever and darling movie. I wanted to give a fun movie to my niece and her children. Most people have seen &#34;A Christmas Story,&#34; so I decided  on this one. &#34;Milo and Otis&#34; is another talking animal movie that is a lot of fun too.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|I enjoy the different seasons and so many levels with each one. Very good for the imagination. Some levels easy and some very difficult.
B008B8DY2O|5.0|Gregory David Roberts is a superb writer and story teller. My only problem with the book is that I stay up reading it until all hours of the night.
B00881VLCE|3.0|It's okay if you just want to pass the time in a somewhat mindless way. Not real challenging and even a bit boring.
B004XXIHS2|5.0|This was a classic I had missed, so when it came up on the daily deal, I snapped it up.  A page turner, it doesn't disappoint!  Suspenseful, psychological thriller, no gore.  Loved it!
B002VRNR1Y|4.0|An oldie but goodie! Jack Nicholson is fantastic and plays the best crazy person ever! If you have never seen this flick, it is a classic.
B009FZFONO|5.0|AMC does it again! I can't wait for the season to start up again. The rest of the cable providers need to learn from AMC and what they've done with Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, and Mad Men.
B0047VLFS4|4.0|I found this very interesting about the life of Hypatia.  Not only was I intrigue about her life throught the movie, but I later purchase a book on her life.  The acting was great I love Rachel Weisz.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|A little too graphic for me.  The detail when he was eating the fish and birds was a little too much for me. But otherwise, very good.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I give it 4 out of 5 stars mainly due to production value and good acting, particularly Fassbender.  However, what keeps this from greatness is that it falls into the same trap as so many other sci-fi movies.  Without giving out any spoliers, it treats religion as belief without reason (i.e., I believe because I choose to believe).  The truth is, there is always reason to believe.  That doesn't mean we always understand everything, after all, how can the finite (us) completely understand the infinite (God).  But, it does mean that there is always an order to truth.  It reminds me of a great quote from G.K Chesterton's Fr. Brown character in one of his detective stories where he states, &#34;You attacked reason.  That is bad theology.&#34;
0345529057|5.0|Well worth the money and a great easy read.<br />Look forward to more... Series is being shared<br />with all our friends who love to read.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Please find a fix for the news feed!!! So frustrating that it doesn't work!! It will only show about 10 feeds and I am not getting notifications.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Book is riveting, i cannot put it down.  The Plot is complicated and is not revealed to the very end.  I highly recommend it.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I'm a big fan of these books and feel they are well worth a read. Have recommended it to a few friends and they came to the same conclusion.
B00A6PD9I4|3.0|Was disappointed with BRAVE.  Annimation was very good but story line just didn't cut it.  It definitely had possibilities but someone dropped the ball.  Glad i watched it on Kindle before buying for the grandchildren.
B00280LYIC|5.0|You know, I'm now an adult that grew up with Harry Potter and I have a soft spot for a great young adult adventure series, but it is difficult to find one that can appeal beyond that demographic. I found this series in it's entirety to be pretty amazing (recommended it to several friends who read them all too), and I have a lot of respect for the author for making the world of Greek mythology appealing for kids (I remember as a kid loving the idea of the myths but having a difficult time finding a mythology book that wasn't dry).
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|What's not to love about this movie?!  Robert Downey, Jr. was great as usual, as was everyone else in their role.  Best movie of the year.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I really have nothing to add other than it was worth all the buzz it got. Give it a go.
B0086DBE62|4.0|Entertaining as well as family friendly. I would recommend this movie with ease.  Watch it and enjoy Julia Roberts in a different kind of role.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|It's been a long time since there's been a book that I was waiting for and had the release date marked on my calendar (and now again for the next installment). I feel like each of the books in the Percy Jackson series gets progressively better and this was no disappointment. Can't wait for the next one...
B0085YNML2|5.0|Very entertaining and a very unique twist. Ui is very responsive and the overall theme and mechanics work well. Chameleon you play uses his tongue to swing from flowers and as you progress different mechanics come into play.
B00280LYHS|5.0|My title pretty much says it all. Each book in this series was progressively better than the last, so I was worried the final book would be a disappointment. Nope. It left me wanting more.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Nice app covers a lot of data and I like the alert! The extended forecast offers thorough info for weeks at a time.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I was thrilled to see that Rick Riordan was continuing in the Percy Jackson universe, though I was worried that I would end up disappointed or that this story wouldn't hold up. The change to third person narration took a minute to get used to, but is crucial to the multi-character story telling. This book was worth the chance, and by the end I couldn't wait for the next installment!
B003MC5N28|3.0|No ending. It was a great big tease with lots of promise in the build-up and then (spoiler alert) literally no ending. This book is engaging with similar tones as the Hunger Games and 1984 just without the big finish.
0375703764|4.0|I wanted to read this while I was abroad and wondered why there wasn't a kindle version. I ordered a hard copy and found out it would be a very difficult book to adapt to that format given the appendices and margin notes scrawled in by the &#34;author.&#34; It's an ambitious and thrilling novel about a house that's bigger on the inside than the outside and the family that chronicles is, the blind man that's obsessed with their reports, and the young man who discovers all these notes and has his life changed in a way where I feel like I should end this sentence without a spoiler. The story is complex, and not necessarily light reading, but the author does a fantastic job at achieving what he was going for.
B009JBZH54|5.0|It's the Dark Knight Trilogy for about the same price as a new blu-ray, what's not to love?  A definite buy for Batman fans.
B000FC130E|5.0|I enjoy Neil Gaiman immensely. I went to London for the first time this summer so decided to pick up this one again to read on the metro and at night in the hotel room. Best possible way to read it.
B008F9VCC8|5.0|I have looked at buying this series off and on for 3 months, they are awesome, edge of your seat, love the characters.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I love the wide assortment of games and they add more all the time. you can win games pretty easily and its amazing how you get all these different games cooking flying candy sports and more. I love this game and if you don't get it your ether mad or crazy.
B009JZPH32|5.0|This movie was ok... needed a bit more action... but it was worth the look if you like these types of movies....
B004HW7JH4|3.0|Some of the situations seem a bit forced, not as good as previous years  Am still glad I have it however
B001G0MFOM|5.0|The L word was not actual on the lesbian world... For a made for television series it was okay... This final season left me with lots of unanswered questions.... Wondering if there will be some kind of movie or made for television movie to answer all left unsaid....
B000Z27HLS|5.0|This is a great movie!!  Anyone who loves period films will enjoy this one too - I was so happy to finally be able to add it to my collection :)
B00AA7O22U|4.0|What can I say, I am a sucker for the original beat em up, rough em up Actors of the 80's!!! Great action and fun to see all of the old actors that aren't around as much! It's a one-time see movie!
0375507256|5.0|My husband and I saw the movie and found it facinating... My husband is really into reading, so this was a must have.  He has yet to get into it, but I expect he will say good things from skimming though it myself :)
B0081L37Z0|2.0|I love these two guys, but in this movie it just didn't work. It was a Bomb! Not only was the acting not so good, the storyline<br />didn't even make sense half the time!
0345529057|5.0|My husband is a huge reader and borrowed this set from the library originally as they were made available, this set was a must have since he loved the series so far and will definitely read them again!
0547884591|5.0|Great information presented only the way he can! Highly recommend this, and all of his books! Thanks to you for the pre-ordering!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|loved it! your kids will too- best Christmas movie to come out ever! You will not be disappointed! I cant wait to see it again!
B000I9YLUI|5.0|It was great to be able to stream this from Amazon when my mom came to visit.  We had just listened to the audio book while traveling.  Beautiful story, very well brought to the screen.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is an awesome box set and you can't beat the price! Loved this series and hope they do something to continue it.
B000M5NRLC|4.0|Just a fun movie! The grandkids loved it! I guess you could say it's an old story done with a new twist!
B009E9QOEO|1.0|I spent the day listening to about the first 1.5 to 2.5 minute clips of each song on this album and it suck's. I thought they would have learned something from the first live album, The Song Remains The Same and just as that  title suggest Zeppelin's live stuff is still the same some 20 years later. Led Zeppelin I , II , III , IV , Houses of the Holy are the Holy Grail of Led Zeppelin and always will be, Please  don't waste your money on this album, because it is the same as, or  if not worse than The Song Remains The Same Album. This album should be called The Song Remains The Same, Only Worse. Sorry but for the price of this album you could get 5 of THE BEST ALBUMS Led Zeppelin ever released. I sent this back
B004AU07O0|4.0|I am a Christina fan, I can remember purchasing her 1st CD years ago.  This one does not disappoint, it can get loud.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|My husband and I are huge friends of &#34;Friends&#34; but never owned the DVD sets, so I can't compare this to those.  What I can say is that there are sooooo many extras that made this set worth it, along with the great quality.  Friends is such a wonderful series and we will treasure this set!
1451695195|5.0|Proof of Heaven--do not let the title fool you that this is a Christian tome about streets of gold and pearly gates. Eben Alexander, M.D., a well-respected neurosurgeon, saw many medical cases in which patients claimed to have seen deceased loved ones or heaven. He dismissed them all as chemical processes in the brain--until he had his own near-death experience while in a seven-day coma. Alexander states that while in his coma his neo-cortex was non-functional. The only thing keeping his body alive was his brain stem.<br /><br />Alexander says he was a Christmas and Easter church-goer, and thought ideas of God were pleasant fantasies. In his coma, however, Alexander experienced angelic beings, and sounds and sights more beautiful than anything on earth. He gives a list of scientific explanations that he used to cite as reasons for these \\"delusions,\\" and refutes most of them because his neo-cortex was not functional and it's the neo-cortex that processes such experiences. He also refutes other scientific versions in an appendix, with medical language that only a physician would understand.<br /><br />Alexander was in a coma induced by bacterial meningitis, and his recovery was a medical miracle in itself. He should have died and his story alternates chapters between his medical condition that worsened day-by-day, and his concurrent experiences in the other realm.<br /><br />While on the \\"other side,\\" which Alexander states is really a dimension that is right here, he had a female guide who took him on a tour of the universe. He'd always had a fascination with flying, astronomy and physics, and found that while out of body he gained instantaneous knowledge and understanding of how the universe works that would take him years to learn here.  He reports that he did not see any loved ones in the other dimension and had no personal identity as a neurosurgeon who had an earthly family to which he wanted to return. He feels his lack of a sense of personal self allowed him to go deeper into the experience than most others who have near-death experiences. While he thought he had not seen any loved ones, once out of his coma he was given a picture of his birth sister, whom he'd never met because he was adopted and she had died. He was shocked to find that she was the angelic guide who gave him the tour of the universe.<br /><br />Alexander states that our physical existence on earth is like a speck of dust compared to the vast reality of love beyond space and time. The reason we do not recognize true reality is that the brain filters it out of our consciousness. While Alexander used to think that consciousness was solely of the brain, he now knows that the brain has nothing to do with consciousness and our sense of existence goes on beyond the body. Again, he knows this because his neo-cortex, which allows for the organization of personal life information, was not functioning. He now feels that our society, while it has benefitted from technology, needs to regain its lost sense of the mystical. Without knowledge of our oneness with each other and all life, we are prone to random violence, escalating greed, global pollution and lack of purpose and meaning.<br /><br />Alexander states his scientific mind never allowed him to believe a loving God exists. In fact, he calls the God he experienced \\"Om,\\" a feminine presence whose message is that love is all there is. \\"Om\\" felt like the primordial creative sound that pulses throughout the universe. This presence is available to everyone and has nothing to do with accepting religious tenets or being a good person. The main messages Alexander received were: all of us are loved and cherished; there is nothing to fear; we can never do anything wrong.<br /><br />I have read a number of near-death accounts and what I like about Alexander's is that his description of life beyond the body most closely resembles what is taught in A Course in Miracles (ACIM). ACIM is the only spiritual path that satisfactorily answered my questions about world suffering. Some of the areas in which Proof of Heaven sounds like it's right from ACIM are:<br /><br /> The brain does not really think. It filters bits and pieces of information and formulates a story. This is what it decides is reality, all the while true reality lies outside its awareness. Our daily experiences are an illusion. However, love is the true reality and the love we have for our children, spouses, friends, pets, etc. never dies.<br /><br /> Time does not exist in reality. Time and space are only a function of the dualistic nature in the physical universe.<br /><br /> We are loved, innocent and there is nothing to fear.<br /><br /> We must choose love instead of fear because we are allowed to choose what we will experience.<br /><br /> The false belief in separation from God is the source of all anxiety and problems and the solution for every problem is recognizing that we are one with each other and God.<br /><br /> Physicality is characterized by defensiveness. There is no loss in Spirit, therefore nothing to defend.<br /><br /> Alexander described life as being like an egg and the creative aspect of God is the shell around the egg's contents. However, he felt that while his consciousness was identified with all that is, he could never fully become one with Source. A Course in Miracles  likewise indicates that God is beyond consciousness.<br /><br />Proof of Heaven is both enlightening and entertaining and it is a must-read for anyone interested in life beyond the body. It is especially helpful for skeptics with a scientific bent, as it answers commonly-held criticisms scientists hold about consciousness and God.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!  It is really challenging and fun at the same time.  When you think your are doing good, it changes on you.  I like game that change things up.  This is a great one.
B00A11AN6O|3.0|Would have been a five except the Amazon Cloud Drive does not offer enough free storage; should be at least 10 or 15 GB. Microsoft Skydrive gave me 25 GB of free storage with no purchase requirement!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I thought the original Angry Birds was addictive, this sends it over the top!  I have found a new favorite game to play.
B0098VXMNE|3.0|be prepared for an amazing<br /> amount of gore and blood and sex its low key B Cable version porn plain and simple with a brief storyline, lots of nudity lots and lots of gore and lots of very frontal nudity .<br />did i like it not so much..<br />if i want to watch adult films then i will rent adult films..<br /> season one was far more engaging and season two frankly left me cold .<br />i just couldn't get into this series and frankly wading through the blood and gore and sex left me frustrated and tired waiting for the story line to develop sadly it never did for me.<br />I am no prude nor am i opposed to nudity or open sexuality in films but this wasn't what i expected .<br />I tried to like it , and i purchased three episodes and after the third i just couldn't go any further .<br />i gave it three stars for a very good try.
B0064MT1U8|5.0|Love this movie! When I first watched this I was so surprised! Very interesting way to tell a great story. Absolutely love this movie. One of my favorites.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|ITS A SHAME THERE IS NO SEASON THREE,<br />BUT alas its not to be .<br />surfing on Net flix i found season one quite by accident and thought oh well i should give it a shot.<br />To my pleasant surprise the first episode grabbed me and would not let me go, i have to tell you i am not a standard slasher  woman running from the crazed deformed chain saw killer in the woods horror fan .<br />THIS IS NOT THAT TYPE OF SERIES!!!<br />it will intrigue you and grab you and keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next episode, it is dark, gritty surreal, and will scare the blazing heck out of you with it's surprising and pleasant storyline.<br />You like ghosts ok i get it , you like mystery  its here, you like a believable story line you got it!!<br />My suggestion is this ..  watch season one first  and be prepared for a darker version in season two , but sadly our family leaves and doesn't return  but the characters in season two are given life by a few of our favorites from season one .<br />its all there enjoy
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Wanted this show so badly in blu ray. What a great cast and acting. The writing is second to none. What a great show!
B007MDB6L0|5.0|My 8 yr old daughters love all the Tinkerbell movies and this one does not disappoint. It is well done as usual, and the story is cute. Tinkerbell finds her sister and of course they get into trouble together! All of the regular characters are in the movie and there are some ADORABLE new animals in this movie!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|My wife and I love this series! This is not yet out, but you know this is going to be just great! Can't wait!!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|Wonderful story and beautifully written. Kate Morton has an impressive vocabulary. She is able to fascinate with all her books. I recommended The Forgotten Garden to all my lady friends!  Can't wait for her next book!
078322740X|5.0|This a funny movie. Not what you would expect, very interesting twist that you hope will happen, but not sure will.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I LOVED the trilogy!!!!!! I couldn't put any of them down, the sequence was interfacing with the events very closely.  Even though it is listed as fiction, I do believe some of the events did take place.  Especially the trafficking.  Awesome reading!
B009GEBBNQ|4.0|Watched it twice, was still as entertaining upon the 2nd viewing.<br /><br />I don't like that there's a required amount of words for this review - so that last sentence was just filler.
1449410243|4.0|This comic book is hilarious. If you like the Oatmeal's blog, then this is a fantastic way to support him and keep him on payroll!
B004XZR63M|1.0|I thought I would give this book a try since it appeared to get good reviews.  Unfortunately, I would not recommend this book to anyone.
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|Whether you liked the original or not, this movie is awesome and beautiful. It arrived in perfect condition; I am very pleased with my purchase.
B00992CF6W|5.0|to do multiplayer both you and your friend must put in the same name and seed .make sure your internet is on.one of. you stays in the file while the other goes to the mainscreen and presses mutiplayer.if it does not work<br />go to optians and check of all the names under multiplayer.
B002ZG981E|5.0|This was definitely one of the best films I saw in 2010. It looks and sounds fantastic on my television/blu ray player at home too.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Wonderful show. I was unaware of it when aired so am so happy to be catching up and ready for season 3.
0307744434|5.0|This is one of the best new books I have read in a long time. The setting is romantic, mysterious, and gritty at times. I highly recommend it.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Probably one of my all time favorite shows. This seasons is getting back to the shows grittier Season 1 roots which is a perfect.
0316228532|4.0|Being an avid Harry Potter fan, I was hesitant to read this book, knowing it wasn't another HP novel. But it was a wonderful book with a pertinent message for today's readers. As if there was any doubt, J.K. Rowling can definitely do more than children's books.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was incredible. I read it on my Kindle and I hardly ever use the note/highlighter tool but I used it numerous amounts of times while reading Perks. It is just a story of a young boy coming to terms with his life, family, friends, and love. I would recommend this book to everyone ages 15-25. I actually limited how much I allowed myself to read each day because I didn't want it to end. Really hoping Stephen Chbosky writes another novel soon.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|This is a great game. I did pay for it and it was well worth it. Good game. The only thing I can say is that I wish that it was a longer game. I could keep on playing over and over again.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|I'm a action fanatic; and this movie did not disappoint! From beginning to end it was pretty much nonstop action. If action is what you seek; this is your movie.
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|Very good movie. Great for family viewing. Would of liked a ending with more closure,but overall a very good movie.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Amazing man that gave everything  he had to his family an  country.  Thank you for sharing  your story and living  life to its fullest.
B001CB4SRW|5.0|I've had many Leatherman products over the years and this one is no exception. I purchased this pouch for a Gerber multitool and it fits just fine. The Gerber needle nose pliers extend from the bottom of the pouch, which I thought it might cause a problem, but so far it's working just fine. Since the pouch is nylon, it drys quickly when wet and does not mold like leather does. The hook and loop closure is very good and keeps the tool inside the pouch very secure. The pouch comes with two side pockets for pens or such items, making it quite convenient to store a pen and other items close by. The pouch also has two loops on the back side that allow the pouch to be carried horizontal instead of the traditional vertical carry. With everything considered this pouch is one of the best you can get for holding a multitool.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn's books are always action packed and Mitch Rapp is the man for the tough jobs. Thrilling to the end.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book has many nice twists and turns in the plot that keep the reader surprised and wondering what will happen next. It is a great read!
B007SGLZP8|4.0|John Grisham spends a lot of time on background, maybe more than the casual reader needs, but always comes through at the end.
B001706I5I|5.0|Jim Carey is masterful and the visuals of whoville and the who's is awesome. Very well done overall! I think this film would of gotten three stars at the most if they casted anyone but Carey.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This movie is entertaining and worth watching, just not as amazing as the other Bourne movies.  Still recommend watching if you like action.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|My wife and I watched Hope Springs and we were glad we saw it alone at home instead of in a group or at a theater.  The subject matter is embarrasing.  The movie was enjoyable, but not as good as other Meryl Streep films.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|Very fast paced and stylized in your face zombie. Exciting read as you are pulled into the take over. Max Brooks if you are reading this please write more books, the two are not enough.
B008EQIEWS|3.0|I DID ENJOY THE MOVIE, HOWEVER, IT WAS A BIT OF A LET DOWN.  NOT NEARLY AS EXCITING AS EXPECTED.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|The Lost Hero is one of my Daughter's favorite books.  She read it in 2 days.  She enjoyed the humor as well as the action.
B000JNN0SM|5.0|This film ranks amongst James Cameron's finest work to date. While there may be some rehashing of devices seen in The Terminator, this film takes the time-spanning story in a satisfyingly logical direction. As to the quality of this particular iteration (in this case, the &#34;Skynet Edition&#34; blue-ray), it's flawless. As other reviews have already stated, ditch your older version, and scoop this one up.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|I've listened to this CD many times. I was listening to Pandora online radio, &'whenever one of MIss Gardot's selections was playing, I'd find myself going to the computer screen to find out who had that haunting voice & wrote those haunting  lyrics.  I bought all three albums at the same time & enjoy this one the most.
B00005Q4CS|4.0|This is my favorite movie and someone stole my copy. So of course I had to get a new one. It plays well, but my case was torn and my cover insert was also torn, which made me a little mad.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|I am a Reacher fan and will read all of Childs books as the come out and I will see the new reachee movie
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Love Diana Gabaldon books - she has a knack for keeping you enthralled and unable to put the book down until finished.<br />I now have a Kindle and am happy to see that I can still read her novels.
B007SGM084|5.0|Despite being one for more classic literature, I'd read this again and again! Luckily on my Kindle I can! And not worry about someone stealing it!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Not as good or exciting as Hunger Games, but a necessary read in order to under stand just what happened to Katnis and Peeta.
B008KE3960|5.0|fun combination of elements<br />planes and tanks with you having to decide how to pattern your planes and what kind to use to get the most out of them . very intuitive
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This book is NOT for tweens or teens.  It is an adult book about teens who are faced with life and death choices!  I found it facinating and quick moving.  Could hardly put it down.Katnis is the girl you always want on your side!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved the series. And the ending seemed to fit with the overall story. Would recommend this book and the series in general to anyone.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The YouVersion Bible App is one app I use a lot. It has every major translation of the Bible that I'm aware of, including my favorite, the 1984 NIV. You can switch between translations quickly and easily, and many of them are available for download in case you are in a location that does not have connectivity. It also has an audio feature for folks who want to listen to the Scriptures being read while they are driving or people who are vision-impaired. I am grateful to the developers of this app.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't wait till the next update comes out. I can't wait till there are buckets and mods. mode are only for people who have been playing minecraft for a long time because after a year or so it becomes boring if there isn't something new or different.
1455502626|5.0|This was an awesome book.  I love the character of John Corey.  The modern day Columbo without the charm.  I highly enjoy the books that star John Corey and would love if they would put together a movie for one of these stories.  Nelson DeMille is fastly becoming one of my favorite authors.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|I love family guy but sorry this movie just wasn't funny to me.  Guess I'm just not into pot humor
B009JBZH54|5.0|I'm a Chris Nolan and Batman fan, so this was a no brainer for me. Extra features are sparse, as others have mentioned. I&#34;m sure a super special edition will come out next year, and i'll probably buy it(and sell this one).
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Love this show! There hasn't been a show this good since the Sopranos. I can't wait for the next episode.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Every page of this book kept my interest.  It really taught me a lot on how things work in 3rd world countries.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this book I have not read anything like this before but there were good reveiws so I gave it a go. I am so glad I did. I could feel for them the children, Fighting for their lives having to kill their friends to survive. I am glad I bought the trilogy I could not stop reading also  glad I have a kindle it made it easy to take with me to carry on reading. I would recommend this book
0061733199|5.0|My brother bought this book prepping for Y2K &#34;which didn't happen&#34; and I thought it was amazing. So i bought my own several years later. If your looking for a book to teach you everything on how to primitively survive this is it. There are other good ones out there as well but so far this is my favorite. The colored pictures of ediable plants, the sketches on who to do various things realy aid with the actual literature itself. Amazing product everyone should have one of these at ther house for that just in case possiability.
B001U0HBPQ|5.0|Better than I expected.  Worth the price and worth the time.  Had some fun &#34;Gump&#34; - like history references too.
B0091REZMW|2.0|The game starts out good at first then when you try and play it later the game will freeze up and not load.  Started the first two rooms couldn't go any father because it won't open.  Had to delete the app.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|The ideal airplane book, it's absorbing and I developed a need to finish to find out<br />what really happened and hoped for a surprise.  I did get that.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was lovely! I couldn't put it down..it was heartfelt and really took you into Charlie's mind..one word AMAZING
B004J4WKTW|5.0|The story of the circus lures you into what you think is a benign source of entertainment, then surprises you with the changes.
B009VB7QQA|3.0|But I found it really hard to suspend disbelief on this one.  It was entertaining, but I found the premise a bit silly.
B00AE2LJVS|2.0|Didn't really go anywhere, characters weren't interesting, Shia LeBeouoef's character was a huge moron, Tom Hardy looked unmotivated.  Lame film.
B007885NOA|5.0|Great artist, great album.  Passenger (Mike Rosenburg) is a gifted songwriter, guitar player, and singer.  Wonderful, thoughtful lyrics, and a pleasure to listen to. One of the greatest recent albums.  The whole family likes it (teenagers and parents).<br />Now, we just want access to the rest of his music and older albums.  How come &#34;Wicked Man's Rest&#34; is only available for over $100?  C'mon, record labels and itunes, get the rest of Passenger's music and re-release it!
B0098460O4|4.0|Only wish it had more songs on the CD. I'm not a big opera fan but this couple is fantastic.
B00009TB5G|5.0|It's amazing how Peter Jackson managed to capture imaginary places, people, and creatures in this terrific screen adaptation of a terrific book. All three movies far exceeded my expectations. Kudos!
B004GVUPFE|5.0|This is a wonderful game. I enjoy playing it. It keeps the mind alert. The children love it and it keeps them occupied for hours. Great game.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|It took a little while for us to try it after we got it; then it took a while to read the instructions. Then we loved it!  The game is much easier to play than the instructions make it seem.  Our traditional family, two teenagers and mom and dad, love to play this.  The kids play it with their cousins and friends, too.  Later, we got the &#34;Seafarers&#34; expansion pack which adds another cool dimension. The expansions are not needed to keep it entertaining, however, since the gameplay changes each time. Two things to be aware of: you must have 3-4 players, gameplay is more like 1.5-3hrs than 1 hr.  A fun and engrossing game, different each time.
B007MAETA8|5.0|My husband and I love this CD.  It is one of his best.  Thanks so much.  I will tell our friends about this great CD.
1594200823|5.0|Michael Pollan is a great writer that teaches while he entertains.  This book is a must-read for anyone who eats food.<br />Prana!
B008HJGPVO|4.0|i like the fact it come with 3 different tips and the clip to attach it to the kindle is very helpul. If you don't like dirtying your tablets with your fingers and cleaning it later, you should get this.
0345457692|4.0|A fun read with some great Sci-fi concepts explored.  Not perfect, sometimes a bit hard to follow, but a nice book for airplane trips or a relaxed weekend read....
B000T1GKH2|5.0|Originally produced as a gag.....became timeless classic.<br />After 40 years, Ian Anderson has released Thick as a Brick II. Will need to check that out.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|More than kept my interest. The central mystery was<br />more firmly established (why is Kvothe an innkeeper?), and remains unresolved.<br />Keenly anticipate the next installment. Wondering if more than<br />three days will be required.
B000V6AF1C|5.0|This is the Bon Jovi collection many fans overlook.  This is my second favorite after Slippery When Wet. Your not really a fan if you don't have Blaze of Glory.
B009A9EPLM|1.0|John Williams has built a career by writing overblown, emotive quasi classical music. It is unfortunate that Big Budget Hollywood film producers and directors won't look to the classical music world for scoring their films. Indie Directors and Woody Allen regularly do just that. Williams music is just bad Aaron Copland-save your money on this and buy a couple of Copland discs. If tou choose the staples-Billy the Kid, Rodeo, The Third Symphony and Appalachian Spring you will find that Williams just begs and borrows from Copland, America's greatest composer. (with apologies to Charles Ives and Duke Ellington).
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Always love Nicholas Sparks and this one did not let me down. Can't wait to see the movie now. Great story.
B008UFUOH6|5.0|that I will probably listen to all year long.  I love EBTG and the individual singers.  Wish they put out new albums on a monthly basis.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|This was a beautiful yet heartbreaking story. Fantastic young love being rekindled. It's one of those feel good stories all the way through.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|The camera does not work unless the kindle fire screen is pointed toward the subject.  Consequently, it is not entirely functional.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn's book was compelling-- a page turner from page 1..  Lots of unexpected twists and turns.  I loved it.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|The kids loved the movie and so did I. Great for the holidays when everyone is gathered around and chilling out!
B0073LWEXK|5.0|played this game on kindle fire with no problems. fun little adventure game and a great price. thank you for making a version the fire can usr
B002NZTZ8S|4.0|A Christmas classic for ALL ages.  Heartwarming.  The visuals in the film are amazing.  Some sequences stretch a little long, but overall a wonderful movie I always watch at Christmas ... more than once!
B008QMMEOE|3.0|Cute-but nothing special, perhaps that is because this is a free version-and the other is better? Nice for little children though. My 3 year old likes it.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|Please tell me how you expect someone to review a purchase of item that is bought as a Christmas gift. This gift was purchased as a Christmas gift, has not yet been given to the recipient and will not be opened until Christmas. Bad f0rms get bad results.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book is not something that contains new thoughts. There are other books out there that are about similiar subject matter. The author of this book makes it fresh. This is written by an academician, one of good standing and well respected in his field. His risk in writing this was out weighed by his desire to share his most extraordinary experience. Well worth reading.<br />Teresa
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is very simple to play and my kids were able to play it instantly.  They love being able to unlock characters and boosts.  Great game for kids and adults to help pass the time.
B003THHIEM|5.0|For those who missed the first season, and for long term fans, it is a good vehicle to get to the roots of the show. I had forgotten the back stories, such as Beckett's watch and ring that she wears. Also, there are running jokes and story lines that run through out the 5 seasons that originated in the first season. The writing is good and the cast shows the promise they would fulfill in later seasons. It was fun to see Esposito with hair too!
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app tells you everything you could possibly want to know about your battery condition and more. It tells you how much time you have left for a number of common apps. It even shows you a graph of the battery's state of charge over time,hour by hour. So you can see how low the charge level was just before you last started to recharge it.  It's just a great value!
B009GEDP26|5.0|If you are a Castle fan, this is a must. The story line just gets better and the cast is really growing in talent. They have been a little playful with the shows this season with an intense one thrown in here and there to keep us on the edge of our seats. They are adding more back stories with the other characters this year,letting you get to know Gates and Ryan better. Beckett is letting her hair down, so to speak, more this season too. Great writing, super acting and none stop story twists, best show on TV.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I have a regular Kindle Fire, but if you are having trouble with it, contact the developers of the game and/or Amazon Customer Support. If that doesn't work, then go to your settings and lock your orientation to a position that feels comfortable and fits your needs. I hope this Helps.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the diary of the wimpy kid, it's awesome.<br />It is hard to get my brother to read but hand him this and he's reading
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like this bible very much. I had a hard time figuring out how to make it work on my iPad. I still have not figure out how to share it with face book.
B0084B1T8Y|4.0|NICE, EASY READ OF A CLASSIC PIECE OF LITERATURE. NICE, EASY TO FOLLOW STORIES THAT CAN BE READ IN A SHORT TIME.
0802473156|5.0|Though [[ASIN:B00A91O51A The 11 Pillars of Relationship Success]]  and the 5 love languages share a lot of similarities, Pillars offers a few more \\"languages\\" and is a much quicker read. Despite that, the author Gary Chapman has created a great piece for those of us looking to take our relationships to the next level. This book has helped my relationship go from a place of uncertainty to a place of optimism and hope. Thank you!
B009SIE6AA|5.0|How could JT do it wrong???? : )  The feeling in his songs is always there.  You have to have this one!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What makes this book different and so subliminally effective is the care that's gone into it.<br /><br />First the story. Death as a narrator provides a perspective that no human or omniscient narrator could. He's sad and funny and almost human. Exploring a side of WWII Germany that contradicts the norm brings home the universality of human suffering and love. The characters are drawn with precision and you can't help but love most of them.<br /><br />The writing is mesmerizing. Zusak is the best kind of writer--one whose every word is perfect. It's easy to understand why it took so many years to perfect this novel. He writes in powerful metaphors that convey their message in a word or two. e.g. the door that's answered by pajamas and the woman who's a wardrobe with a cardboard face.<br /><br />Finally, whoever did the typography and book design is a genius. Pay attention to how the type speaks to you. (and do notice the dice)<br /><br />I loved this book on every level and hope you will too.
B007HACDLK|3.0|Like some other reviewers I get a sense of deja vu when reading this one. Maybe Mitch is past his prime! He comes off as being arrogant and churlish in a lot of the conversations.<br />But nonetheless, it's an easy read....but not the best in the series by a long shot.
B0072OFM28|3.0|My favorite series, had to had the continuation of this epic show, Spartacus second season is what I expected. Awesome!
B009FZFONO|5.0|I am not a TV watcher - sometimes I will get into a show for a season, then I'm done.  I have not been able to stop watching the Walking Dead.  My husband and I subscribed through Amazon because we can't wait for the show to come out on Netflix - it's awesome!
B009SQRL4U|5.0|We love this movie in our house my boys are 5 & 7 they think it is great fun. It is a good way to spend some family time together. As a mom I find it entertaining too!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is simple, and yet fun and addicting. I love trying to get all of the dragons and seeing what new dragons they will come out with next.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I loved this!  A study of good and evil, when good does not always win. I'll read every single one of them!
030758836X|2.0|After reading all of the great reviews for this novel,I was looking forward to a relaxing with a good read; instead, I got a slow moving and unrealistic storyline.  What a disappointment!
B009FZFONO|5.0|great digital quality for an excellent show that is very well presented.  Amazon video purchase was simple straightforward and easy to do.
B0095BFO0Q|4.0|Spoiler alert - Imagine a conclave where no one wants to be Pope and when some poor sucker accepts election, he has second, third and fourth thoughts, a crisis of conscience and finally tells everybody he's not the right man for the job.<br /><br />It's a wonderful reversal of Anthony Quinn's - The Shoes of the Fisherman.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|This movie was a nonstop action movie, but some of the sequences were totally absurd and not based in reality.  It was fun to see all the old character actors popping up along the way.  I would recommend this to someone wanting to kill two hours :~)
B0096HIEE2|2.0|For all the hype, not a particularly enjoyable movie. The plot line, if it exists, is slim. The acting not up to par. If what you want to see is a bit of male anatomy, it'll probably serve. But don't expect great entertainment.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I highly recommend this! For all puzzle lovers this is a must have. Bravo to the makers. An addictive treat.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The not so much Disney version of the story of Snow White. Not for small children. I'm not so sure about adults either.
B000ID1J40|4.0|Was unaware that this movie was ever made. Maybe it is the title??? Could have picked a title with a bit more intrigue and glamour. Had the potential to be outstanding then fizzled
B00A7CI82I|3.0|Not as gripping as the original Bourne movies. A viewable movie with plenty of action. However, I suspect they can stop now.
075669812X|5.0|This was for my 5 year old grandson.  He loved it!  He spent the day looking at the book, we cell rated an early Christmas
B009HV2JT8|1.0|Mindless vampire exploitation flick. Silly in a historical setting. If you expecting much - don't. I don't believe, I'd buy this one if I had it to do over.
B004NOCCEG|5.0|This documentary exposes the corruption of the entire financial system and explains in-depth just how far it reaches.  If you have ever wondered why much of the economy is in the state that it is in, then you should watch this!  Matt Damon does a fabulous job narrating.  I appreciate the fact that many people who seem to be from both sides of the story are interviewed, as well as those who refused to be interviewed noted.  From bailouts to bonuses, this film unearths it all.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The Wool stories were a surprise - an interesting and well writen set of interrelated short stories/novellas that I knew nothing about before purchasing this book.  The surprise was half the fun, so I don't really want to say anything about the details here.  What I will say is that Wool reads like a cross between a Twilight Zone episode and your favorite post-apocalyptic movie.  The characters are well-drawn and the setting and plot are original.  If you are a fan of SF, you will almost certainly enjoy the Wool Omnibus Edition.  Recommended.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|All I can say is WOW!!!! Very nice knife charpenrer, I don’t care what anybody says about this product its a great piece of utility to have when fishing or just out in the woods and in need of a charp knife to cut up some bate with a charp knife. also a great product to have in the kitchen
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Follett's second book in the Century Trilogy carries on the stories of all the families he introduced in the first volume.  His prose is workmanlike and informative; nothing elegant or artistic here, but in offering perspectives from Russian, American, German, and British characters, he at least provides a good &#34;point of view&#34; history lesson.  He also manages to inject underlying lessons about the changing roles of women; and helped me understand why the upper classes of Europe were so threatened by the notions of justice and equal voices in government for the lower classes that they saw in the world wide workers' movements. Like Tolstoy, Follett gives several vantage points on marriage in the early to mid 20th century.  In all, not the most satisfying/pleasurable read,  but I knew more when I put it down than I did when I picked it up.
B0031RS894|3.0|I was never a fan of the Sontarans. I'm still not. Despite that, this book wasn't too bad. Not great, but not terrible. I would maybe recommend it to any established Whovians. If you knew nothing about DW and this was your first exposure to it, I'm sorry. It's much better than this! I promise!
B000EOTAM6|4.0|The concept behind Aeon Flux is intriguing. It's a dystopian vision of the future in which all but a handful of people died out from a disease. The survivors are left in an Orwellian community that claims to be the last refuge against a disease. But a handful of rebels has risen up against the leaders. There's potential for a fascinating sci-fi plot. Unfortunately, the movie generally descends into a flashy Hollywood action flick after that. The movie does resolve the plot with an interesting twist, but doesn't really explore the moral or philosophical implications. I guess if anything it's a more thoughtful and interesting action movie, but could have been more.<br /><br />I do appreciate the cinematography for the film. There are some visually interesting scenes. Much of the movie is done in an almost abstract style. It relies heavily on visual imagery and relatively less on dialogue to tell the story. Generally, this worked well. The futuristic world was mysterious but not too unrealistic. Lovely use of water for various scenes.<br /><br />As for acting, let's just say Charlize Theron can pull off an action hero.<br /><br />Overall, Aeon Flux is worth checking out for fans of sci-fi action movies. It's definitely not cerebral sci-fi, but has nuggets of interesting concepts. I give it 3.75 stars for being one of the more interesting action movies to have come out in recent years.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I had heard a lot about this book but I wasn't sure if I would like it. It was great though. It was a great read and it makes a lot of sense. It has great advice and information inside. I advise every married couple to read it.
0060594896|5.0|As a business/leadership coach, I keep The Success Principles right near my desk and consult it often. Not only is it enjoyable and inspiring to read, Jack Canfield and Janet Switzer provide so many practical ideas that it also serves as a rich reference.<br /><br />Starting with the fundamentals, the book gets us \\"primed for success\\" by reminding us to take responsibility for our lives, ask for help when needed, set clear and specific goals, and break large projects into manageable pieces. The next several chapters focus on building success in specific life dimensions such as relationships and money. The authors close the book with two of the most powerful principles of all: Start Now - Just Do It! and Empower Yourself By Empowering Others.<br /><br />Truly one of the book's best attributes is its clear, engaging, well-placed examples. It's not simply a \\"do this, do that\\" guide or a \\"here's what worked for me\\" story - it's a compendium of success examples from well-known and lesser-known people. The book offers so many stories that all readers will surely resonate on some level.<br /><br />Each year I have the (joyful) challenge of choosing just 4 books for my professional women's success club to read, discuss, and apply. The Success Principles made such a powerful impression on me that I've chosen it as one of our 2013 selections. I have no doubt that this book will prompt hearty discussion and promote not just action steps but action LEAPS among our members! I highly recommend this resource for business - and life - success.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I thought I would enjoy reading &#34;Casual Vacancy&#34; because I enjoyed Rowlings Harry Potter books, but I find it very detailed to the point of annoying.  I am enjoying the insight in a small town in England since England is one of my favorite places to visit.
159315724X|5.0|As a longtime subscriber to Success magazine, I have appreciated the simplicity that author Darren Hardy brings to many complex business topics. In his book, The Compound Effect, he succinctly shows us how small changes can lead to powerful - even life-changing - results. This is a breath of fresh air for those who tend to make things harder than they need to be.<br /><br />Throughout the book, Hardy offers thought-provoking examples to demonstrate his points. Right in Chapter 1, the story comparing the three friends who choose to either continue their current habits or make slight shifts shows how dramatic the results can be over time. I found this a good reminder that in order to achieve different results, we need to take different actions. But they don't need to be life-overhaul types of actions - just small changes done with consistency.<br /><br />As a business/leadership coach, I especially resonated with Hardy's emphasis on connecting with the purpose behind one's actions. \\"Forget about willpower,\\" he writes. \\"It's time for *why-power*. Your choices are only meaningful when you connect them to your desires and dreams.\\" Linking to the purpose makes your change much more sustainable, not to mention enjoyable!<br /><br />While I would have enjoyed more examples of successful women in the book, this wasn't enough to deter my 5-star rating. In fact, I've selected The Compound Effect as the first book of 2013 for the professional women's success club that I facilitate. We'll spend the first quarter of 2013 discussing and enacting the principles this book shares, and we'll certainly bring examples of successful women into the conversation.<br /><br />If you're ready to stop merely thinking about making changes in your business or life and to start taking intentional action, you'll appreciate the simplicity, encouragement, and practical suggestions The Compound Effect offers.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Seems to work fine so far. All my books were immediately available for use. Haven't tried to access any yet.
B0020M99LC|4.0|Daniel Craig is a grittier, harder Bond, who isn't without his vulnerabilities. The story is interesting, action packed, great cinematography. Visceral action - no glaring CGI to derail you from the tale.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|I kept hoping that the Clancy of \\"Red Storm Rising\\" would somehow rise from his grave. I give up. He was K.I.A. years ago.
B000V63BN6|5.0|A great mix of early Little Stevie Wonder hits as well as classics from the 70's and beyond. If you enjoy the Motown sound, a great addition.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Although it's a relatively recent release (2005), it uses some pretty cool effects in terms of animation. The story moves along at an exciting pace and keeps you captive as it progresses to an amazing ending. Like Dickens' A Christmas Carol, I believe it's destined to become a classic. So glad I made the decision to purchase it! Would recommend it highly!
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|We were not amused nor entertained by the juvenile attempts at humor nor the plot.  This movie is very much like Bridemaid. So if you liked the sick humor contained in that movie you will disagree with my rating.
B004Y8075M|5.0|In my opinion, Lois Lowry writes the best books ever!<br />In my opinion, Lois Lowry writes the best books ever!
B008B1VYP0|5.0|I love this band so buying his was no big whoop, to me.Over Exposed is one of my favorite albums.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My two five year old granddaughters love playing this. I don't usually play games, but I got on it last night and couldn't put it down - lots of fun!
B001U887P6|5.0|I bought these for a gift and my mom loved them. She said they were extremely comfortable! I would buy them again!
B0001HAISG|5.0|My daughter loves this movie! She watches the Disney cartoon as well (which is what I grew up with) but she will alternate between the two. I thought it was a great remake of the Peter Pan story, very entertaining! I would definitely recommend getting it.
B000JQU7U8|5.0|An example of a man acquiring the way.  Not a guide but an example of one man's journey.  Much more meaningful to me as an adult than when I first read it at 14.  Being further on my past, it makes more sense to my life.
B003UAKE9Y|5.0|Great film! It's nice to see something a little different for a change and this movie did just that. My family really liked the movie. Very entertaining and I would recommend it.
B000MV8XPG|5.0|I purchased this for my grandsons.....and......THEY LOVE IT!! Its well made and easy to assemble. I would reccommend this toy.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|I really enjoyed this - it set future America in a post-apocolyptic world.  But to those living in it, it was just how life was.  Reading all 5 volumes and finding more questions as I went was both fascinating and frustrating.  I had to move onto to his next trilogy to learn how things started.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Never in my life has a book made me cry. I cried for some time after finishing this book. My first John Green book, and it will not be my last. Beautiful writing and wonderful characters that you will fall in love with. You can tell a lot of love and effort went into this book. While the concept of the book is simple, the narration makes it a somewhat complex and a very intriguing story. It would be cheesy to say this book changed my outlook on life, but well... it really did.
B009JBZH54|1.0|Hi, not sure why but the the 2 first movies are fine but the audio of TDKR is terrible. you just can't hear what they say.<br /><br />not sure why, is it because the is no dolby option and only DTS. the 2 first have dolby.<br /><br />also the TDKR is a bad movie compare to the 2 others.<br />am i the only one with this audio problem. I have a ps3 blueray<br /><br />thanks<br /><br />jm
0316228532|2.0|Although no longer a youngster, I read two or three of J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter books and enjoyed them. I felt that the stories moved along quickly, and had good plots, suspense, and likable characters. I also thought they were clever. With all the hype about this book which she wrote for adults, I thought I was in for a treat. I was disappointed.<br /><br /> My impression is that the plot in this book is weak and even uninteresting, and the characters are not depicted in a way that lets us identify with them with so that for a long time it is difficult to remember who is who. Although I disliked the book after a couple dozen pages, I pushed on because Rowling wrote, as I said, more than half a dozen good books. However, after a hundred pages and tedium, I gave up.<br /><br /> I was interested to see if others agreed with me, and many did. As I write this review, 2293 reviews are posted on amazon; 932 gave 4 or 5 stars, 342 gave 3 stars, and 1019 only one or two stars. The average is 2.9 out of 5. This is below the category \\"this is o-k\\" but above the category \\"I don't like it.\\"
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Who doesn't love Angry Birds?!?! I completed all the levels and moved on to the other games like seasons and space. Now I'm replaying the original, AGAIN!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|One of Baldacci's best. Believable plot. Interesting characters, and locations. Moves along at a great pace,very hard to put down. Nice twist at the end.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Just a verification of already present views. Nice to see he chose to share his experience. As a nurse of over 35 years, I've had patients tell me (in private) their experiences and ask me what I thought. There are many paths to God and some are lucky enough to get a glimpse earlier than others.
B009NQKXYK|1.0|Go to IMDB for good user reviews of this movie.  Here is the summary:<br /><br />Good:  Special Effects<br />Bad:  Storyline, character development (none), character likability (none, and for being scientists, really, really dumb), premise, motivation, dialogue.<br /><br />I was really disappointed in this movie.  Even if the plot was awful, at least have good action or tense moments...but it didn't have them either.  Two evolved, opposable digits down.
B000HL09SA|4.0|This movie is very entertaining!  I highly recommend viewing this great movie, My  Dog Skip, with you children and grandchildren
0062082353|5.0|than what's been said?  Kyle is a well-known figure, and he tells a good story.  There are some emotional moments; sadness at lost comrades, and laughter at some of the lighter bits.  For a guy who didn't much care for the &#34;Sea&#34; and &#34;Air&#34; parts of his position, he still did a fantastic job on the &#34;Land&#34;!
B000B7VZJM|1.0|It is a family tradition of ours that no Christmas is complete without a viewing of the \\"Muppet Christmas Carol\\". My husband and I bought this movie for our children when the VHS first came out.  We all have pretty much memorized this heart-warming movie. We feel bad when the bunny gets decked with the Christmas wreath, and for the mice who get \\"no cheeses for us meeces\\".  So you can be sure we were disappointed when we watched our new DVD this evening and saw that the song \\"When Love Is Gone\\" had been cut.  Our kids are now grown and have small children of their own. I would have liked for my grandkids to see the movie the way it was meant to be seen. Our VHS copy is worn out.  It is so very sad for whatever reason that Disney has cut out one of the best moments of the movie.  Bad decision, Disney.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This game reminds me of the fair games. Only now you can take your time and play as long as you have coins. No waiting in line or losing your place at the game. Fun game
B007KOMTUI|3.0|The story line goes flat in this episode.<br />A little disappointing .<br />I may try the other episodes to give it more chance.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This game is fun and to watch everyone play is funny. they try to out do each other and some times it works. This is a fun game.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I haven't enjoyed the last few Grisham novels, but I must say this one redeems him as a teller of tales.  Lots of twists and turns and some great characters too.

B00AHSMDQY|3.0|I did enjoy this movie, but was a bit disappointed with it compared to the first two.  It is a bit hard to understand at points and tries to pack too  much story into an already lengthy run time.  Still a fan of the trilogy, but doubt this movie gets a second watch.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|After I downloaded this game I started playing it right away.  It's great because you have different games to pick from.  Try it.

B009VB97EY|5.0|I love this movie, love the extras the dvd has. I wish the movie had even more dance scenes, I could watch it for hours.
B003BWERF8|5.0|I purchased this item to connect my Ipod Nano 6th Gen with a new pair of LG Bluetooth headphones.  I have had no issues with this product.  If I could find a con it would be the size.  The Ipod Nano 5th gen is the clip on style and this transmitter is about half the size which makes clipping on clothes a little heavy.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Despite great stars, the plot is slow and just not good.  The acting is great, but that doesn't make up for the dialogue
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is very entertaining. I can sit and play this for hours at a time. Its hard to put down. I love playing temple run on my new galaxy s3; the screen allows me to see better and play more efficiently. Great game, a must have.

B005869U6G|4.0|Not their best and not their worst, but nonetheless, still pleasing to the ears!  I enjoy Promises, Promises and Adolescents, as well as a few other tracks on this album.  Never failing to disappoint, go ahead and pick up this album if you're into the Incubus sound!
B007SGM084|3.0|The first and the last book were interesting. Too much sex and some were the same as before. The writer did not describe the characters well.
B002Q63JEU|5.0|Not as great as the Riot release, but just as good with that familiar Paramore sound.  Other artists are known for changing up their sound in sophomore albums and ruining their original style of music (I know this isn't their second album, but it is their second top-selling album).  I would definitely recommend this to others.
B0040QDMBE|1.0|The word \\"cherrypicked\\" cannot describe the manner in which Ha-Joon Chang chose arguments to support his thesis, that the state is, of course when ran by the correct and enlightened people, the best organization to direct economic growths. Using \\"cherrypicked\\"  in this context would be an insult to cherries and picks.  Using the word \\"one sided\\" to describe this text would be an insult to non-euclidean geometry. Ha-Joon Chang is not even ignorant, since he chose facts that would have contradicted one of his theses to support another thesis. Ha-Joon Chang  is simply dishonest.<br /><br />For example, when writing about early US history and protectionism, he attributes the growth of US economy to protectionism, not to the large number of immigrants that were arriving each year, all of them with skills and most of them with money ... When singing praises (and praises are sung in a high voice, he is not beating around the bush) for state interventionism he fails to mention that state interventionism failed in more instances than it succeeded, or that the apparent success of state interventionism in the developing world in the '60s and '70s can be more readily attributed to cheap credit and still having a reserve army of agricultural workers, which neither the Communist states in Eastern Europe nor the others had available in the '80s, when Ha-Joon Chang claims that a switch to more free market ruined the good life brought earlier by state interventionism. When writing about the progress of South Coreea from the '50s to the '90s he does not peep a word about the crunch that came in the late '90s.<br /><br />The \\"washing machine\\" anecdote is simply wrong. No woman wasted hours each day washing: rich women had others to wash for them, and poor women were working anyway, did not have the time to spend hours washing ... hand washing is not the hugely time consuming chore he makes it to be and never was: for example, outsourcing this activity was first done by working women, not by the rich.  It might appear to be a huge chore if you grown in a home with lots of servants and you have a few hired just to do the washing for everybody else.<br /><br />I will not waste more time on this. I am sorry I bought this book. I wish I would have back the time I wasted reading and expecting the surprise, the gag that would make the whole unwholesome mess make sense.not by the rich.  It might appear to be a huge chore if you grown in a home with lots of servants and you have a few hired just to do the washing for everybody else.<br /><br />I will not waste more time on this.

B0064TVQ5E|2.0|having to tolerate ads prior to playing the game does not make it 'free' and its rather annoying, need to pay for app to really enjoy it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. This was the first time I've ever had to put down a book to gather myself. And I had to do it twice. The plot twists will leave you breathless and needing a chapter break.<br /><br />I fell hard for Sky and Holder right from the beginning. Sky is funny and cynical, her banter with the other characters had me cracking up.<br /><br />Especially gay Mormon best-friend-in-the-world Breckin.<br /><br />\\"I'm Breckin. I'm in an alliance to overtake the public school system and all its minions with your daughter.\\"<br /><br />I liked these characters and grew to live these characters and then fell so completely in love with Sky and Holder that I don't think I'll stop thinking about this book any time soon.<br /><br />The way the fun moments are weaved together with the heavier, emotional moments made this book real. I didn't think it was possible to craft a more loving, beautiful guy than Will Cooper. I was so wrong. Dean Holder was wonderful. I actually cried at one of his lines about two-thirds through. I won't ruin it but seriously. Get your highlighter ready.<br /><br />One of my favorite lines:<br /><br />\\"It was all I needed to let go of the awkwardness. A good slap on the ass.\\" - Sky<br /><br />I can't wait to see what Colleen Hoover has next.

B007THA4FI|4.0|I enjoyed this book and I liked that it switched point of view often. I liked the social consciousness that was woven into the book and how there's an underlying &#34;brother's keeper&#34; theme.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My husband loves that I read all of these books too, it has really helped to bring us closer.  A must read for anyone wanting to spice their love life!
B004A8ZYZE|5.0|The more people that read and understand the author's message concerning real communication the better. It's painful to see people read a Power Point presentation and then, as one in the audience, to so quickly forget it.
B004ZN9RWK|3.0|Was expecting lyrics with the seemingly 'home made' cd<br />guess you should mention this when you promote your services<br />kinda false information to us consumers
B0031RS2HC|3.0|After ploughing through the Vince Flynn 'Mitch Rapp' series I was underwhelmed with the introduction to 'Jack Reacher.' Killing Floor moves fairly well but Jack doesn't have the same bad boy spunk as Mitch.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|Thank you for the quick service.  I love the DVD!  I'm trying to see all of the past episodes so I can see the third season in January.  Thanks!
B00493E1GI|5.0|This movie was a movie that I really enjoyed.So in truth I think it was super that this service allowed me to get it. I just wish it was already part of my Amazon Prime account due to its age also it was in HD for the same price for the purchase.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This was a recent discover via NPR. They immediately jumped to one of the years best albums after my first listen. I highly recommend it.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|I have heard about this book since high school and finally decided to pick it up. Wow. Every night I couldn't wait to get into bed and read what Catherine and Heathcliff were up to. Now I'm finished and I've started 4 different books, just to be disappointed. None are nearly as good as this one. It will suck you in.
B004HX4RT6|4.0|I added this to my android phone and I'm happy I did.  No glitches, starts every time.  Plus, it's challenging!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Works well, nice that you can wake to your own tunes. I would definitely recommend to others. Will also let you name your alarms, eg. work, weekends, etc.
B006OOHYIC|1.0|Installed it 2 times on my android phone.  Never worked.  Pretty frustrating, since I took the time to install it.
0425264351|1.0|\\"I shot both of them.\\"<br />Pretty exciting stuff.<br />No more Lee Child for me. Should have known better than to expect a British author to write good southern American story.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|This movie was great, especially at the end. It all makes sense now. Great story and enjoyable ride for the family.
B005OCHOZS|3.0|a little disjointed and abrubt ending took away from an otherwise good book. the stories were inspiring and relatable which made the book interesting.
B0095R64AO|4.0|This is a great and funny movie to enjoy with your wife. We had a great time watching this movie.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|always enjoy MIB! The entire series never disappoints in the comedy factor. From MIB original through to 3. Hope MIB4 is in the works!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Another good read.She always keeps me quessing the outcome till the end.<br /><br />As a medical person I love the forensic details.
B009VSW15Y|2.0|It's fine if you just want to take pictures of yourself. You can't aim at anyone else and take a picture.
B00000K31Q|5.0|Bought this for my daughter. She loved Heath. Still loves the movie.  It's just a nice film.  never gets old
B008I43DYU|4.0|It does what it's supposed to do. A simple calculator.  There's not much too say. If you need a calculator this is it
B00AMBM9MO|1.0|Wasted some time of my life trying to suffer thru this movie. Gave up eventually. I would recommend at all.
B009O2XY12|2.0|Not too impressed. It keeps trying to lure you into spending money to continue the game. You also need to be hooked to the internet to run this so don't take it in the car thinking you can play it
B004SIIBGU|5.0|Works good keeps you up on all items you are bidding on or watching. It helped me get a item I was really interested in buying
B005544V6A|4.0|We found this show in the &#34;Hidden Gems&#34; section of Amazon Prime's Editor's picks. We both enjoyed it. We are looking forward to future episodes.
B00873GRU4|5.0|This book was a fantastic read! It kept me hooked from start to finish! I looved the style, viewpoints and mystery! It's a great Sci-Fi novel set in a futuristic appocalypse, and would recommend it to anyone who likes Sci-Fi!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Simply amazing from start to finish. i couldnt put it down. suzanne collins is a genius . A true page turner
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Never played the real thing. But this is fun. like that I can keep playing without having to buy anything.
B008476HBM|5.0|Ms. Austen's book revenues will not be affected by anything I have to say about this book, it seems silly to write a review. It is also beyond my skills to praise it adequately. Just read it- now.
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|This app doesn't work like the normal google.  It is very slow.  I will definitely look for a different search engine for my Kindle Fire.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Brian Sanderson has a knack for constructing ornate, arcane, highly textured worlds and the characters who inhabit them. My only quibble with his work, and it is a minor one, is that his characters seem to have little or no romance in them unless they are pining for a lost (dead) love... That aside, I enjoyed this book and look forward to more works by this author.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|The game is a throwback to first-person adventure games of yore, namely Myst and its ilk. It is, thankfully, not one of those mindless &#34;hidden picture&#34; games, instead requiring some thought and problem solving to complete its challenges. This sort of gameplay appeals to me, and others, I imagine.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Was a great read and Michael Connelly hit it again with Bosch...His research is so very near perfect. Loved it. Can't wait for the next one.
B004V5A7K8|2.0|Like Arkanoid of old, but without a lot of the complexity there present. More ball control would have been nice (i.e. if the ball were more consistently sensitive to the motion or position of the paddle). Without it the game is basically just an endurance test; keep the ball moving until its initial angle allows it to clear the game board.<br /><br />One disclaimer: my wife--a non-gamer less inclined to analyze the finer points of gameplay--loves it. I imagine many others will too.
B00003CXPJ|5.0|I really love this movie. It is hilarious and I am so glad to have it in my collection now!
0345803485|3.0|So after all the hype about these books, I decided to go ahead and read them.  I didn't like this book very much.  I mostly read mysteries, so this isn't my typical genre.  I didn't find the content of this series believable at all.  I know that many people disagree and loved the series, but it just wasn't for me.  I prefer something that is a bit more believable.  Throughout the 2 books in the series I did read, I felt frustrated that instead of getting into some content of the story, they constantly jumped into bed.
B003VANOFY|5.0|First gaming headset, ive worn regular headphones before and I'm never going back. The wireless aspect is really nice to watch movies or something from a distance, as laptop speakers aren't all that great. I recommend this, that is all.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I could not put The Language of Flowers down.  A very interesting take on the impact of being a foster child and how it affects past and future relationships.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|I bought this for my young girls.  I started playing the game so I could teach them.  I have figured out that it is a little too hard for my young girls (5 and 3).  In learning how to play the game, I now like the game.  Also figured out if you don't belong to social media, you can't advance through the game as well
B006LSZECO|4.0|Gillian Flynn puts enough twists in her novel about mystery, marriage and the mystery of marriage to keep the reader clicking &#34;Next page.&#34;  Her characters are well-drawn and it kept me engaged in the plot line with every corkscrew turn. An understory about what people will endure to get and stay married...and what they learn about themselves and each other in the process.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|Movie was great. I don't think it was Pixar's greatest work but it was very cute for a Disney movie.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|No script--one long chase. Facile ending--will not  dignify as a conclusion which implies  content.  Soooo grateful that I had not paid full freight at the theater!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game on pc. Needs to be updated and then it will get better reviews and its a must have!!!
B00008G7UF|4.0|I have been looking for this movie on DVD for ages – this is my go to classic for a girls only Sunday afternoon – funny and romantic.
B0014VQGX4|5.0|My grandson is 17 months old and loves this Backhoe.  Plays with it all the time.  I am looking for more trucks to give him for Christmas.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|Have no idea why this movie didn't do so well when it was released but has everything for me – my 2 favorite male leads and a decent story!
B00005MP58|2.0|I ordered this 2 DVD set and sat down to watch it. The 2nd DVD ended in the middle of the story.<br />Nowhere on the cover does it say it is just a partial movie. Which DVD set completes the movie?<br />I was so dissapointed.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Well the grammar errors continue in book 3, but it is just such a fairy tale romance that I like this book as well. They really should have done a better edit job.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I've been following the exploits of Harry B since the beginning.  Could Michael Connelly really find something new to add to Harry's long list of brilliantly solved crimes?  As the story began and just for a moment, I thought 'oh no...he's doing the street gang thing...'  How wrong was I?  The intricate plot with layer upon layer of new clues and information left me nearly breathless.  Well done Harry and Michael.  One of the best in the series.  What a great read!
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Good starting point if you intend to publish your books on Kindle! Thank you Amazon, I recommend this to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This book really sets everything up for the three books. Slow at first, but really picks up. A must read.
B00AKL1XPU|3.0|i was playing fine all day and now when i try to load the game it starts openin but when it should be fully loaded it closes
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a very compelling story, which kept you on the edge of your seat.  I can see why it has been so popular with all ages.  Reminded me a bit of Lord of the Flies.
B0064O927I|5.0|A very nice watch, and looks very alien.  My only complaint is pressing down those two sensors to see the date, or light it up can be very difficult.  but i love the watch!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great game cause its 101 games in one really fun and good game you should get it log and fun get it fight now
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The story had some great moments I just had to keep reading. Anyone looking for a fun romance this is a good one.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|Loved it! Great plot that had a great ending! Actors did an excellent job especially the young Tommy Lee Jones.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|Written from the perspective of a child, it gave the reader a unique view of a horrible situation, which he thought was perfectly normal and how happy he was in that situation.  I actually had wished the book went beyond and it hadn't ended where it did, but despite the fact this was a book I would have never read, I really liked it and read it quite quickly.  Definitely a different read.
B0084B1T8Y|5.0|Start with the tale of the mongoose Riki-Tikki-Tavi and then go back to the front of the book and pick up the original tale of Mowgli and the Jungle creatures. If you thought you have enjoyed the simplified versions of this tale, you will enjoy getting to know the complete original story.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|Am hoping to have time to fully read this book as soon as possible, as the portions I have reviewed have been excellent.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|Didn't expect much from this film but was pleasantly surprised & plan to watch it again Nice action film with some unexpected twists
B006HL9G10|5.0|This is a very easy app to set up. You can preset several different timer lengths and the gong sounds are great. Being able to see how many others are meditating at the same time is wonderful.
B00170DEM8|5.0|Holiday Inn is an excellent Holiday comedy. Fred Astaire plays a delightful dirtbag of a friend and bing Crosby almost makes you feel bad for him. Mix in lovely ladies, songs of holiday import and dancing, this movie has it all. It does have a relatively racist number singing about Abraham freeing the black slaves. Otherwise this movie will sing and dance it's way into your heart and home as a holiday tradition.
B0086213XW|3.0|While watching this movie, I was disappointed in places but I kept watching and was glad I did. I liked it much more after I thought about the plot and the underlying meaning.<br /><br />If you are looking for a fast-paced film - look elsewhere because this one isn't it. Take This Waltz takes a long time to get going. At first, instead of building momentum, we are presented with a bunch of quirky characters (Sarah Silverman, for example) who seem to just wander aimlessly around in life. But once the main characters, played Michelle Williams, decides what she is going to do, the movie picks up and the pieces start to fall in place.<br /><br />I agree with some other reviewers that parts of the film are way too slow and that sometimes the characters seem unrealistic. But that is part of the beauty in the film. Some people do not have direction in their lives and because of that are drawn to whatever or whomever helps give them some excitement. Unfortunately, those same people often do not bother to think about the consequences of their actions until it's too late. As one lady says in the shower scene, \\"new eventually gets old.\\"<br /><br />Now, Michelle Williams's character will annoy you to no end because she's always crying and is way too timid in her marriage. But Seth Rogen's character isn't without his flaws either.  And the actor who plays Daniel (Michelle Williams's admirer) is just as much a loser as the rest of them.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend that you pay full price to view Take This Waltz, but if it's only $2 or so, it would be a good movie to have playing in the background as you clean your room or to watch while playing Scrabble.
B006ZZAMWK|5.0|I've heard some of their songs on the radio this year so when my daughter asked for it as one of her Christmas gifts I obliged.  Cute band with PG lyrics so it's good for any age.
B0059XTUVI|4.0|\\"The Iron Lady\\" is a compelling tour-de-force by the incomparable Meryl Streep, portraying the indominitable Margaret Thatcher. The story flashes back and forth, starting from Margaret's beginnings as a fresh-faced young woman interested in politics but not taken seriously by the party. We see her grow and become more powerful, reluctantly taking advice from political pros to change her voice, hair and dress so she will be taken more seriously as a powerful political figure. Sadly, however, we also see Margaret in decline, the ever-supportive Dennis having pre-deceased her, the years of focus on politics resulting in a frosty relationship with her children, dementia slowly claiming her. Alexandra Roach as the young Margaret was not quite believable. . . .I wish we had seen a bit more of the strength of will that must have always been there. But Streep as always is a pleasure to watch.
B008602KQI|5.0|I took my daughter to see it in theaters and we loved it so much I got it for her for Christmas.
B00AMBK6J2|1.0|We were really looking forward to this, but it felt like I was watching Alf again. It had a very predictible storyline, and seemed to go downhill as it went on.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I never got it so we cant tell you. Very disappointed for the little ones to play with at the hoildays
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Another great work. Polished it off straight away. Next: Winter of the World. Follet's story telling style simply captivates me. Brings the fictional characters to life while keeping within the historical context of world events. Great read!
B009VB7QQA|3.0|If you go into this movie knowing what you are getting into, you will find it very entertaining. Expect silliness. Expect Matrix-like action scenes. Expect gore. You'll enjoy it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for when I searched &quot;alarm clock&quot;. You can make as many alarms as you want, and there are many different alarm sounds to choose from.
B00AHSMDQY|2.0|I'll admit, I'm not a DC fan. So I've never even heard of Bane. I suspect I am not the only one. They would have been better off choosing a villain people have actually heard of.<br /><br />The plot was drawn out and hard to follow. This movie should have been cut down to about 2 hours. The fight scene between Bane and Batman was lame; if all it took to defeat Bane was a few punches to his face, why didn't Batman do that in the first place?<br /><br />As usual, Christian Bale's exaggerated vocal performance was just silly. Between his throaty rasp and Bane's mask, I found a lot of the dialogue difficult to understand. I probably didn't miss much though.<br /><br />The only positive point to this movie--other than the obvious: special effects--was [SPOILER ALERT] the introduction of Robin at the end.<br /><br />If you're a hardcore Batman fan, you'll probably love this movie. Otherwise, you might want to pass.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I was a little doubtful about this book due to the silly title and the way it began, but I loved it!  Every other chapter or so goes from real time to the main character's past.  Real time reads like a Westlake Dortmunder book and the past is very creative with the character's activities in his past.  Maybe you have to have a particular sense of humor, but I enjoyed this book VERY much!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was very inspiring and believable.  the author has a lot of credibility and was very convincing.  It's the closest description of actual proof of heaven's existence. If you are a skeptic, take some time and read this
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Usual Grisham, good plot, well written buy a little disjointed at a couple of spots but still a fast moving read.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|it was better than I thought it would be..despite the vulgarity which I knew going into it.  Mark Wahlberg was perfect for the part
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The best show on T.V. to date. It's interesting, suspenseful, heart-wrenching, and much, much more. I look forward to every new episode. MUST WATCH!

B00006ZXSK|5.0|This had got to be my favorite movie ever!! Drew Barrymore is amazing. I probably quote the movie at least once a day. The original love story of love.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|I enjoyed the movie although I thought it would be funnier than it was, from other people's quotes. I don't regret renting it. I just didn't expect to see any serious parts.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fun and addictive game! Many challenges and objectives. Can't hardly put it down!  Rated awsome! Rated great! Telling everyone about this.
B002361MLA|5.0|If you've got a lot of \\"noise\\" running around your mind, like myself and many others, this book is a smart choice.  The \\"noise\\" I speak of is the endless stream of thoughts, hypothetical conversations, and worry about this, that, or the other thing.<br /><br />The book's Q & A format is great because if you're reading this review, and interested in this book (or the self-help genre in general), then you have questions and are seeking answers and solutions.  The Power of Now definitely provides a lot of answers and explanations.  The \\"solutions\\" you'll have to come up with on your own.  They differ from one person to the next and should become clear as you digest the information within.<br /><br />Depending on your personal belief system and/or religious practices, some of the realities explored in the book may seem a little \\"out there\\" or \\"new age-ish\\".  My advice is just keep an open mind.  There was nothing in this writing that seemed off, wrong, or  insulting to my personal beliefs.  That may be because the very \\"religious\\" upbringing I was force-fed always seemed \\"off\\" to me, but I had little choice in my younger years.  My point is we're not exactly taught the \\"truth\\" growing up, or exploring life as an adult (about a great many things).  The intent of this book seems to shine a light on that fact rather well.  Whether or not it is something you're *ready* to learn about is up to you.<br /><br />If you're already on the \\"path of enlightenment\\", there may not be anything truly new in The Power of Now, but what it has to offer, it does very well, in my opinion.  In my case, it spelled out and reinforced many truths and realities I already felt deep down inside but struggled to bring into my consciousness.<br /><br />It's been very helpful to me and may be to you, too.  Keep in mind the book only contains information.  Any difference in your life it makes will be in how you *apply* the knowledge, not in simply having it.  In other words, if you're seeking help with something in your life, you need to do the work in order for positive change to happen.  Understanding alone will not cut it.  That's just my personal advice, not something the book gets into.<br /><br />I've already recommended this to a couple of friends in my life and now I'm doing the same for you.h something in your life, you need to do the work in order for positive change to happen.  Understanding alone will not cut it.

B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|I love this game it is just like the PC version and the graphics are almost identical! I highly RECCOMEND!!!
B009AP2G26|4.0|The first couple of episodes of season 4 were awful. I almost stopped watching altogether. The Finn story-line was stupid. From then on the episodes have majorly improved.  I'm in my late 30's and I was transported back to my freshman year of college and the unsuccessful attempts of trying to hang on to that high school romance. Yes I have cried watching Glee this season. Marly the new girl has an awesome set of pipes and sounds nothing like Rachel. I'm so glad they've kept many of the same characters around in semi-plausable ways...though sharing roles in Grease was a little over the top. That episode was a bit ridiculous.  The music rocks as always though even though some episodes are amazing and some aren't.
B009EAO38C|5.0|Absolutely Amazing. My husband saw them on a morning show and was so excited to tell me about them. We searched youtube and found the video of &#34;What Makes You Beautiful&#34;. I was blown away and just had to get their album. I also got the Christmas album.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|Totally love this movie! The music was interspersed with the dialogue perfectly. The songs were catchy and the whole cast was very lovable. The only thing that bothered me was the vomiting. One of the main females vomits when she gets nervous on stage. The first scene with her puking was enough. But, then they do an additional throw up scene in the middle of the film that is absolutely ridiculous. I hate that scene. It is just gross and pointless. Other than that the movie is excellent and will have you singing their songs the whole day!!!!!!!
B00846REIS|4.0|I liked the book, and it was a very easy read.  I was more annoyed with Eva's (main character) than anything.  I would recommend the series to anyone that liked 50 Shades.  I must stress, this is NOT the same.
B000MPEIF6|3.0|Good to watch with your respective other with big bag of popcorn. I'm definitely considering on watching the whole saga.
B0057XSCJG|5.0|I gotta say this movie is heart warming and worth a shot to watch i would re rent this movie again that is for sure :-)
B00632HWOG|1.0|Worked great until I updated it today. Now it won't load any message. You would think a big player developer could develop an app without these issues.
B0052OWGYW|5.0|big fan of Jason Statham all his movies are awesome and this one will not fail you for sure the edge of your seat action!
B009YP9L7U|5.0|A fun read!<br />I especially like it because I have a friend that is living this story.  She is single and wants a baby!  I will recommend this to her.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I am a new fan of American Horror Story.  Watched the 1st season through Amazon Prime and was instantly hooked.  Season 2 has been great so far.  I eagerly await each episode.
B0018QQQK8|4.0|Loved this book the only thing I found it slow in first several chapters changing from character to character getting the base storyline. But one of his best Nicholas Sparks is awesome love all of his books that I have read.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|This movie was awesome from start to finish I highly recommend to anyone who loves a good story line it has action an suspense
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a fast quick game.  Good pastime when I need some diversion.  Played a lot of this with cards all my life.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|The topic of NDE's (Near Death Experiences) has been the subject of numerous books. However this one based on a neurosurgeon's personal experience raises the question of science versus the concept of human spirit. It's a good read that keeps your attention.
B0063GORYU|4.0|More difficult, but mind challenging.  I have another one on my Mac computer that I like better.  This is Ok!
B007KDFWRG|5.0|My husband is Dereck Trucks' biggest fan.  This was one he didn't have and he listens to it while driving
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed the book. It was entertaining and easy to read. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes to read.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|This is so badly written, I wasn't able to get past the first chapter.  It is beyond belief that a book that is so badly written is a best seller.
B001NOQI3U|5.0|I am a Streisand fan and know that this movie is not very close to the way things were, but the story is great and it is well acted regardless.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Just too long. Took the fun out of Batman.  Bane wasn't really that good of a villain.  I like back story as much as anyone, but this just didn't really work.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This was an outstanding performance!  The first time I saw it was only  by chance and I had expected  to walk away.  Instead I ended up buying it - not once , but twice!  After the performance ends come encores which are also a treat.  For any Les Mis fans this is truly a treat,
B009AP2G26|4.0|Very talented young people. Sue, Will, and the counselor are funny and love their prospective on life:-) watch the show!
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|My fiancé and I originally read this book to get us talking about problems that may arise in our marriage, what I didn't expect is that it would give me new insight to all of my relationships whether it be work or friends I've known for years.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The first third of this novel is riveting.  It's the Grisham we know and love - great plot development with a sense of what will happen next?  Little character analysis, but we forgive that.  After all, this is Grisham we are reading.<br /><br />Then everything falls into a confused and convoluted mess, starting with the making of the &#34;documentary.&#34;  &#34;Why is this going on?&#34; we (my wife read the book as well) asked, and the answer does not become apparent until the end of the book.  So we suffer through endless scenes of movie making and complicated plot machinations that make no sense until the story, supposedly, all comes together when the novel begins to wrap into a climax that has no credibility. Amazing that Grisham's chain of implausibilities could have all been pulled off (actually impossible), so that the novel could be tied up into a &#34;satisfying ending.&#34;<br /><br />The book is bad, as was his last one (The Litigators), but don't get me started here.<br /><br />Sunschill
B00AKKGX4W|2.0|I am surprised at all the good reviews.  To me this book was boring, overly dramatic with a forced plot.  The heroine was weird and the hero a wimp.<br /><br />I'll not be purchasing a book again by this author.
B005OCHOZS|4.0|Scott provides a very honest and raw recap of his youth, family life, the rise to becoming one of the sports elite competitors, and his life after &#34;racing&#34;. This book will provide motivation to better your life through physical activity and improved diet, regardless if you are a runner or not.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Not the best of the Scarpetta novels but definitely better than some. Almost a little too much forensic detail but overall a good read. Glad Cornwell is still doing the Scarpetta novels again.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Both my 5 year old and 10 year old love this game. i would highly recommend it! Definitely worth the $3.
B007HACDLK|4.0|I found The Last Man to be interesting and fast reading.  Sometimes the leading character, Mitch, seemed contrived, almost too much.  I still consider it worthwhile reading.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I have a kindle fire.  The App worked fine until a recent upgrade and now my email will not load. Its been &quot;loading&quot; for two days.
B001F12J48|1.0|I was intreged by this 3-D movie, expecially given the low price.  However, don't waste your money as the quality is very poor.  We are great fans of the Polar Express movie and excited by a 3-D version.  But very disappointed with the quality.  It is unwatchable.
B006N57PXG|5.0|Very good. Book is pretty interesting. I would recommend this book to most people but I would recommend more description.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|Movie was ok, kinda boring and not much of a plot.  Expected alot more out of this movie .  Straight up wouldent recommned.
B005PR422K|5.0|Eric expresses the issues around startups very well and gives practical guidance and how to succeed.  The concepts of Pivots and MVP have become ubiquitous because of this book - others may have coined the terms but Eric has found a way to reach and convince a broad community.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|SWEET TOOTH reads quickly, engrosses the reader, and still manages to offer a surprise!<br />McEwan is masterful in portraying a young woman.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Love this movie! Very happy with the reasonable price and how fast it was ordered and received :)<br />Unless it was free-could not be better.
0062213423|5.0|Purchased for my daughter who loves 1D. I was blown away by the quality... great pictures and more text than I was expecting.
B000QFAJ7S|3.0|I love Kelly Clarkson, however I think Im going to stick to buying single purchases.  I didnt like this CD as much as Ive enjoyed some of her previous work.
B009SQRL4U|3.0|Overall this wasn't a bad movie. I liked the way that &#34;Santa&#34; was handled, very different approach to the usual.
1582701709|3.0|The reason I give \\"The Secret\\" only 3 stars is the fact that the author makes it sound like all you have to do is focus really hard on what you want in life and you'll get it. Sure, this is important, but there's more to it. You need to take action! It's not about sitting on your butt and hoping for miracles! Anyway, it's a good book for motivation and definitely worth a read.
B005PUUMK8|5.0|I never get tired of listening to Pollini's Nocturnes.  No passages which become irritating upon repeated listening, which is not the case with some famous pianists.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|Game is designed for children.  When the child plays your account is charged through Amazon for every level.  Charges are progressively higher and higher.  Gameloft should be put in jail.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Great follow on to the first chronicle, now waiting for the third one. Love all Ken Follett books, especially the thrillers.
B009FZFONO|5.0|The show is great and the picture quality is very good. I will be getting all my episodes from amazon.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Mitch Rapp character continues to be rock solid.  Vince Flynn continues to put out a solid story every time.  Worth reading.
B005I547ZG|1.0|I bought the eBook. Instead of 3 stories the book contained only one (which I did not particularily like). I do not mix it with the sample.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|My son is reading this for school and so I decided to read it too. It is a great book.
B009SQQRH2|5.0|Great movie for kids and adults. My 7 year old son and 4 year old daughter loved it. Plus there are a lot of funny adult phrases in it. We watched this movie twice and would watch it again.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use and it has many options for bible selection, also great voice for listening to scriptures read with feeling....
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Bought this book, because I wanted to try out my Kindle app on my new Windows 8(RT) tablet.<br />The app works great and the book is very good. I'm very enthusiastic about e-books, easy to use app and you don't have to carry all your books around. The book is fun and reads away really fast. Makes you think a bit more about life.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Perfect movie to watch with your family or at a church meeting. It puts us to think about what is really important when raising a child. All the films from this creator are good. A must see!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|My boyfriend and I played this game pretty much non stop... I only had 1 problem... I had saved it on a glitches half way through the game and had to start over... but that wasn't a bad thing... the second time through everything u looked for was different and the mini games were fun! we are hooked on these kind of games! I'd like to see more of these longer games from big fish... cuz its totally worth the price... Download, you wont be disappointed!
0345410025|5.0|It's a good book to exercise your memory. It also gives a history background about memory techniques, but you need to have discipline and invest time to apply the techniques on a daily basis.
B00007GZR5|3.0|This was a good Movie,a little over my head but it don't take a whole lot.But I did get what they were getting at. All and all I would order again.It's about killing yourself,and where it will get you.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great movie, by the awesome Will Ferrell!  It is just super funny and a great family movie!  A must see for the holidays.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|Crazy Michael Cera makes this movie fun. What a nerd! The rest of cast is also fab. Beck and Metric contributed to the sound track and it shows. The cheesy video game graphics and special effects work well with the editing and pace of the movie. Sure to gain a true cult following. Watch out for the Vegan Police!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I think the best of the three. Ties it all up. Still very hot erotic sex. Wish there was fourth book.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|This movie is so funny. I enjoyed it very much. But beware parent this is not a movie that you allow your kids to see. Because this bear does things that children shouldn't see.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This novel was very well written and the mystery unravelled in unexpected ways. I didn't want to put it down.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved this movie it was full of action and adventure , it was truely amazing ! I would be hard pressed to find anyone who doesnt like this movie.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Caitlin Moran is raw and funny and honest in a way that very few women dare to be. I enjoyed her book immensely and have recommended it numerous times to other friends. I laughed out loud many times while reading it. She manages to be honest, funny, outraged, and warm, all at the same time. No mean feat!!<br />Read it.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This album is simply outstanding and I won't belittle that by trying to explain it. Buy it, love it and shut your mouth while it's playing.
B003U9TDII|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie and a big part of the movie experience was the soundtrack. It added so much to the movie experience. The music without the movie is not quite as great, but I still enjoy listening to this soundtrack. Some songs more than others, but overall I give it 4 stars.
B0076DELIG|4.0|Reading a story composed of familiar characters is reassuring and allows the imaginations to progress in a natural way.  This is not the best Harry Bosch, but it is entertaining and, as usual a 'page turner'.  I recommend it to all fans of the aging detective.
0446554995|5.0|When last I reviewed, Pendergast and I were enjoying a heady reunion.  But always another woman got in the way.  It was always Helen, Helen, Helen--the man was obsessed!  Therefore, it is no surprise to find this final volume of Douglas Preston & Lincoln Child's latest trilogy entirely devoted to the mystery of the woman who was Aloysius Pendergast's long-lamented wife.<br /><br />I was frustrated, not merely by the Special Agent's eternal preoccupation, but by the antics of the authors.  Part One of the novel left me wanting to bitch slap someone, and Messrs. Preston & Child were the most obvious candidates.  You'll see.  But that's merely the beginning of this odyssey.  Patience was required.<br /><br />There was so much of the tale yet to unfold.  As Proctor, Pendergast's long-time butler observes, \\"...of all the surprises he had experienced in Pendergast's employ--and there had been many--this was the greatest.\\"  Obviously, I'm not going to reveal the nature of that surprise to you, but I will say this: another best-selling author wrote a very similar plot device into his long-running series, and it was the final straw.  I determined he'd jumped the shark.  It speaks well of Messrs. Preston & Child that they pulled it off admirably.  I guess I'll hold off on that bitch slapping.<br /><br />Two Graves truly features all that Preston & Child fans could desire in this latest installment of the series.  For starters, a large number of recurring characters play a role in the proceedings.  You'll know to expect many of them based on the two prior novels in this trilogy, but there were a few unanticipated cameo appearances.  I particularly enjoyed Corrie Swanson's participation; I can't seem to get enough of the girl.  She's just a great character--one of many that these authors have created over the years.<br /><br />Starting with their debut, Preston & Child's novels have always been fast-paced.  And I may be mistaken, but it seems to me that they may be getting even faster.  Chapters are short, numerous, and tend to end on hooks.  There's plenty of action and a goodly number of plot twists that took me by surprise.  Another element fans have come to expect is some speculative science.  Two Graves will not disappoint.  \\"It seems to have to do with genetic manipulation, or quantum mechanics, or perhaps some combination of the two.\\"  Truthfully, the science is my favorite part.<br /><br />Critics may comment that the plot is derivative.  I can think of at least three well-known novels that it owes a debt to.  But honestly, in this day and age, what isn't derivative?  What's more important is that each author puts their own spin on the material, and that they have.  And even more importantly, at long last, many series questions have been answered.  There are clearly more stories left to tell in the Pendergastian world, but for now, this reader is deeply satisfied.  And perhaps the matter of Helen Pendergast can finally be put to rest?faster.

B0083P1QUM|2.0|I know that Cornwall is a revered writer, but if this is an example of her talent, I don't get it.  Choppy presentation, unrealistic characters and a spotty relationship between killings mar this book. Not for me.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is the only dictionary app I have found that can be used as as actual dictionary.  I love it.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Excellent movie for young kids, my family loves this movie. I highly recommend it. Very colorful and beautiful scenes and message!
B0091V6TF4|5.0|If you love the music from the James Bond films, this is the CD for you. Encompasses all the great ones and brings back great memories.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|It left me on the edge of my seat! I can't wait for it to pick back up... but if they kill Daryl... I am going to be SO not happy. He is my favorite!
B009FBX5M0|5.0|What can I say about an album of the newest James Bond music? The score is killer in every way; full of excitement and majesty.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|The writers better win a Grammy for this show! They have surely earned it! But they better not kill off Daryl!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|This movie was amazing.  The whole cast did a creat job.  I think Guy Pierce, Tom Hardy and Gary Oldman did a great job of embodding their aceents for their characters.  Great story line.  Tom Hardy is proving to be an actor to follow.
B0088RQ4X4|1.0|not a good try at all a lot of hard work doen the drain missed the mark by a mile, wulda shuda cuda
B00AMBM9MO|5.0|Couldn't stop laughing.  This movie was great.  The humor was so crass.  I absolutely loved it!!  Can't wait for them to make the 2nd one.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|Almost as good as the original , i can see another episode coming later.the ending is interesting and kinda sad.
B00AA7O6QC|1.0|The dialogue was just . . .sad.  The movie was also predictable.  There was absolutely nothing special about this movie.  Everything was so cheesy.  The acting was poor also.  It was like everyone was just going through the motions.  It could be most of these guys were always poor actors and I'm now just old enough to realize it.  Jason and Bruce did what they could, but how could they carry this movie by themselves?<br /><br />I was very disappointed.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I loved this movie from start to finish.  I laughed so hard, I cried.  The message was delivered with comical sensitivity and Will Ferrell was outrageously lovable.  I actually watched it twice because it was such a pick-me-up movie.  Watching this movie was my season opener and what a great way to start.
B001974DG0|4.0|the story was good and as always dean koontz's writing style was enjoyable and entertaining.  i do recommend this book.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|My 11 year old son has tons of fun playing this one.  We had no problem at all downloading it.
B007TK77QE|4.0|J. K. Rowling proves that she is up to the task of writing an enthralling novel that appeals to an adult audience. Very well written - the story takes you into the lives of a small community in the UK and explores very forcefully some of the issues at play in that country today.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|The movie just didn't interest me. I regret ordering it. There wasn't much going on and I was bored to tears.
B005K2XUPK|4.0|I love this little sleeve.  It is built really sturdy and is a snug fit.  The inner lining is soft and smooth.  The look is nice and this little guy is tough!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun so far

B008PZ69T8|5.0|keeps me mellow on my drive to work, and i like knowing what songs relate to certain parts of the book
B008M87GJK|5.0|I find BBC news to be very well presented, informative in its global reach and articles. I look for news that will educate and inform me on a global basis, that I can depend on to be accurate -- and BBC is one of the few news channels I choose.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I went into this movie thinking I was not going to like it all that much.  I could not have been more wrong.  It is great!  Great action movie!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I think Orson Scott Card is the best writer of religion when it comes to science fiction. His understanding of the human person truly brings out the characters.
B007HACDLK|4.0|This is a good story that makes great airplane reading. I didn't find it as gripping as some of Mr. Flynn's other novels, but a worthwhile read just the same.
B009SJ3GUK|3.0|I liked this season, but didn't get excited over it like I did season one. It's worth the watch, but maybe wait to see if it comes out on Netflix or Prime first.
B0095ZMMCK|3.0|I know Clancy takes a long time setting up the characters and the scenario, but I felt like this was more like one of his Op Center books.  He likes to describe in detail how weapons work and how software works but sometimes I get lost in all the technical jargon.  Interesting story that fits current times as we rely more and more on electronic gadgetry to conduct our military operations and everyday business.
0812993292|5.0|Harold Fry receives a letter from a long lost friend, Queenie, who is dying in a hospice. Something has taken place in the past between Queenie and Harold and he believes he owes Queenie a debt, so he writes her a letter. On his way to post it, his journey to the nearest letterbox extends to the next, and the one after that, and the one after that. A chance meeting puts the idea into his head that if he walks from his home in Devon to the hospice where Queenie is at the other end of England, she will not die.<br /><br />Stopping at a phone box to call the wife with whom he shares a bleak and lonely life to let her know what he is doing, off he sets. He is not just ill-equipped for such a journey; he is not equipped at all. His shoes will fall to pieces and his stamina will falter, but Harold will not give up. He must walk all the way to Queenie if she is to survive.<br /><br />As Harold tramps doggedly on the reader is given a look into his domestic life which is haunted by the son who never comes to visit his parents.<br /><br />In his unsuitable attire and state of decrepitude, Harold is a laughing stock to many people, but as his journey progresses he begins to attract media attention and becomes a cult figure. An assortment of uninvited misfits and crackpots join him on his pilgrimage.<br /><br />I loved this book on many levels. Harold himself, gentle, humble, dignified, determined. Having walked a similar distance myself, solo, and been mocked, cared for and joined by an unwelcome follower, I could relate to him there. I shared his loneliness, his hardships, his small triumphs and his joys. His route happened to pass within half a mile of where I once lived, so I felt a connection with Harold there too.<br /><br />Harold's unlikely pilgrimage is a heart-warming tale of faith, regret and hope, with some laugh-out-loud moments.<br /><br />One of my favourite reads of 2012.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|Nothing but noise, crazy chases. Terrible! Plot was idiotic, terrible sound, Poor acting, Movie aimed at 10 year olds. Waste of time and money.
B007I2BZIE|4.0|I saw Rush in concert recently and this is the tour they're playing right now. I wanted to own this album along with the concert program and tee-shirt I picked up while at the venue. Rush isn't one of my all time favorite bands, but there's a reason they've been inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I enjoyed the concert and this album took me right back to being there.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|A rather different way to play Mahjong, but fun and interesting. I enjoy the game without the music and do recommend you give it a try.
B0000C1733|5.0|This is a well rounded compilation of the Pepper's music. It's one that I knew I needed to own, especially now that they are Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|you. should get this app! Its the best!: )  I have. used it million times and it nevers gets old. : )  :  )
B0018RA6DK|4.0|Loved this movie as a teen in the 80's, watching now as an adult it just makes me sad to remember how funny Eddie Murphy used to be.  Why he doesn't do more of this I just dont know...
B000T433CO|5.0|Added this to my list of favorite Christmas time movies, great cast and story!  Got this for a bargain at $5!
B008NMT684|5.0|my 3 year old son loves it! he actually mastered the whole touch and drag concept because of the game...wish they had more puzzles but he is mesmerized by the trucks and cars and plays it forever.  we figured out you can pop the balloons when they appear...he loves to do that! fun fun fun
B009FZHYKU|5.0|You can't go wrong with this show - it never fails to surprise you with it's twists, turns, and especially the ending of each episode.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I enjoy these kinds of games that allow you to explore a world and solve little puzzles along the way.  This one is pretty good!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|Made of very soft leather-like material, the Kindle Fire is supported horizontally and vertically at different angles.  So if you want hands-free usage, this is for you.  All in all, a great product.  Amazon Kindle Fire fits perfectly in this case.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Watched the series and then I purchased the graphic novel for my tablet. Great story. Great artwork. Great format. I would recommend this book to other with a colour tablet.
0316227706|5.0|If you love dogs you will LOVE this book.  It is so original and we especially love the photos of the dachshunds!  Such a fun book.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|No instructions. Difficult to use. I will continue to use my phone which does a much better job of videoing & pictures<br />. Disappointing.
B00338QENI|5.0|Reads like a novel.<br />Liked the scientific detail which was unknown to me.<br />I thought the author told the family's story very well and without judgement.
B001GS4RS6|5.0|Well written and a plot that certainly ranks at the top of this type of book.  It gives a vivid (and shocking) picture of the politics of an era.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|I found it fascinating to have &#34;no mind activity&#34; and experience what the author did in his NDE and also remember it.<br />I can't find any of it anti Christian. It is very comforting for me as a Christian.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|British television at it's best.  This wonderful cast of actors and actresses makes you want to continue watching and hope that it never ends.
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|..but that couldn't make up for the areas where it drug. Its almost like they tried to create a lot of character development and plot in a slapstick, which just didn't work. Its a talking stuffed bear, no need to be serious.<br /><br />Not bad as a rental and sitting with a few friends on a friday night, but some of the fun will come more of watching your friends reactions to a few scenes and not necessarily the movie itself.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I hope this series can continue for many years.  There are so many characters to follow and it keeps you interested all the way through.  Typically fascinating British series.  Glad to see Season 3 beginning in January on public television.
B00A7CI82I|4.0|This was a great sequal to the last Bourne... Very cool to see the story line run at the same time as the last Bourne
B0098VXBIA|4.0|This was funny and really worked a lot of the crazy things that the book talks about into the story.
B004WR125O|5.0|Setup was simple on the Onkyo receiver. This saved me from running an ethernet cable to my receiver. Reception was good and the network connection was stable.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Very good, but not as good as Forbidden Garden.  I would also recommend as a sequel to The Forbidden Garden
B009LRE040|3.0|This was a really good story. The action is superb. The acting was really good. A couple of things I don't like is 1) this movie breaks the #1 rule about Batman in that almost no one knows who he is, but in this movie, by the end you wonder if there is anyone who doesn't know Batman's secret identity. 2) this movie ran too long. Therefore this is not a movie I can watch many times because it is way too long. Otherwise I would recommend to this to others as really good.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|I thought it did not flow as well as it could have. -  A lot of descriptive paragraphs which I felt were rather unnecessary anddid not add a lot to the plot. - I have read better novels -<br />Just my personal opinion
B00A0R0CG0|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie! The beginning sequence with Scat is just hilarious! The story was heart warming. I would liked to have seen more of the two trouble seeking opossums, but that's OK. It is not as good as the first movie, but still I will be watching this one many times.
B009KHCT94|1.0|Ok, I stumbled across this movie in pre production a while back and totally wanted to see it in the theater. What a disappointment. It's just not even believable nor even realistic. The clips of the movie are way better than the movie itself.
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|This movie is what you think it's going to be. You can maintain suspension of disbelief for most of the action scenes/stunts, but there are a couple that just require a, &#34;Yeah, right!&#34; Overall, I liked it. However, as is all too common, the ending seems abrupt and unsatisfying.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Lawless- entertaining movie, good action and acting. Highly recommend it. Tells about a true story about the lawlessness of these days and how the law was involved in it.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Since I am connected with my lap top pc, it is good to also have it on this device. Thank you!
B0013GLE4Q|5.0|After becoming the powerful iconic new voice in rock and roll with her blockbuster<br />  debut album Let Go in 2002 and concert DVD My World in 2003, Avril Lavigne would<br />  become the new rock sensation that also helped inspire a steady generation of a few<br />  girls to choose a path of rock.  With her band and guitar in hand, Avril had toured the<br />  world to packed audiences while she built a prolific recording career, which can even<br />  describe the blockbuster success of Under My Skin, which is highly showcased by a<br />  few classic hits including the Top Ten hit Take Me Away, and other classic hits inclu-<br />  ding Don't Tell Me, Nobody's Home, My Happy Ending, Who Cares? and Tomorrow.<br />  So, what make this bonafide second masterpiece just as great is that it includes four<br />  live special tracks that make it the best edition, as it give us a full hour of challenging<br />  music from start to finish.  What is even ironic about Under Her Skin even brings her<br />  closer to the mature aspirations of the signer-songwriter and solid rock star destined<br />  for even greater progress for numerous decades to come where she showcases the<br />  drama, optimism, creative genius, bold persuasions, world class excellence and her<br />  solid showstopping momentum that made Lavigne such a mighty force from day one<br />  and what lies ahead.  As a bonafide Number One album in North America and some<br />  European and Latin American countries, this supercharged blockbuster CD had won<br />  critical acclaim from many music publications like Entertainment Weekly and Rolling<br />  Stone as a result.  She have even been praised by some as the best thing that ever<br />  happen to since Elvis Presley (and I was one of those who strongly agree).
B000T433CO|5.0|This is one movie you can view time after time just not at the holidays. Jack Black plays such a good role nothing like some of his other movies.
B0013GH99K|5.0|In 2002, a rising young Canadian rock star named Avril Lavigne swept the music<br />  world when she rose to the international spotlight with her blockbuster debut album<br />  Let Go, where she have signaled a brand new era for rock at age 17.  Avril's rise to<br />  international fame and debut CD had introduced a bold new chapter which give the<br />  music a new energetic and versatile sound as she belts out a series of solos, which<br />  ups the ante with subtle bleeps, loops and keyboard swooshes.  Featuring a series<br />  of highly intensified beat-driven tracks that start with the opening track Losing Grip,<br />  where it is proceded with other classic songs like the Top Ten hit Complicated, the<br />  power-rock punk classic Sk8ter Boi, the angst-ridden `Unwanted' and Anything But<br />  Ordinary, Let Go is a groundbreaking success story, but equally moving is her own<br />  subtle lyrics, like the outstanding balladry for Tomorrow and Losing Grip when she<br />  bursts with outstanding talent and joie de vivre.  Avril even gave a new generation<br />  of rock fans a powerful new role model and gave the Women In Rock repertoire an<br />  artistic boost and especially the striking blow for what it was desperately needed in<br />  rock and roll around that time--the kind of rock icon who had deliberately changed<br />  the rules and gave well-deserved opportunities for the opposite sex when it comes<br />  to rock stardom (she wasn't the first).

B0070Y46UY|2.0|The first half of the book had what I considered graphic violence among the animals  I have not finished the rest of the book because I was bothered by that. My friends say the book is wonderful and ends with a. Beautiful message. I may never know because of the extreme descriptions in the first part.
B004Q5ZP5K|5.0|When Avril Lavigne entered the 2010’s in full force, she would present a mature, but         high-rocking blockbuster CD that again shot to the top of the album charts and became         another important landmark achievement for the celebrated rock icon when it first came         out in 2011.

When I first brought this CD during it’s release in 2007, I enjoyed it   so much I was rocking up a sweat to the music and now that I downloaded the entire CD   in my I-pod I will always enjoy this supercharged masterpiece.  A Number One hit album   in 12 countries including Canada, the United States, Great Britain, Germany, Ireland and   Mexico, The Best Damn Thing is another timeless achievement from Avril Lavigne which   this high-rocking change of pace again brings her compelling virtuosity toward a brighter   and crystallized momentum that she performed with a true sense of entitlement that add   up to it’s phenomenal success. Oh yes, RCA Records just happen to have the complete   edition that include four foreign-language versions of Girlfriend as well as several tracks   like Alone and acoustic takes from When You’re Gone and I Can Do Better, so you may   want to look to (or rip on) the complete edition and put it right in your MP3 Library which   will give you twice the musical fun.d put it right in your MP3 Library which         will give you twice the musical fun.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Really liked this book. I have read almost all of John Grisham's books and this one stands out with my other favorites.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Although these books are not written the greatest, I found myself lost in the stories, and couldn't put the books down.  It isn't for PG audiences.  I have alot going on in my life right now and these books have given me something else to think about and I truly appreciated the opportunity for that!!!  I am re-reading the first one now, thinking I missed something after reading the last one...<br /><br />I found these books very good at taking my mind off daily problems!
B0012DK4ZU|4.0|It was good over all, a little slow to start but when it picked up it was a good movie. It does set the stage for a really good second part.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I liked all 3 of these books.  Yes, they were sexual, but kept me from thinking about other things going on in my life...  I am glad I purchased them.
B005LAIHRC|5.0|I adore musicals, and I got a real kick out of the humor in this one. Tom Cruise does an outstanding job as the aging, sexy, lost rockstar. In my opinion, his performance is the best reason to watch this over and over again.
B00A23MYCC|5.0|This movie is great! I couldnt stop laughing mark and seth were wonderful in this movie ! I could watch this movie 1000 times and still love it
B004J64QSI|5.0|Great sound on this 25th anniversary edition of Les Miserables!  An absolutely spectacular show.  And when you think it is over, some encores that will knock you socks off!
B008ASLK8A|4.0|Not as good as the first Sherlock Holmes DVD.  The plot was interesting and the nmovie entertaining.  Received as an gift.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I can't wait to hear his side of the story.  It's always interesting to hear things from both points of view.  This reminded me of a Hush Hush meets True Blood story.  I really enjoyed it.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I have only watched the Christmas Carol and never read it, so this is a Christmas treat. The illustrations only add to my pleasure. It reminds me of when I was young and each Christmas we selected a book to read during the holidays.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Like &#34;The Time Keeper&#34; very much because I believe there is a heaven, and also that people have come back to life after being &#34;dead&#34;.  Also, the medical information gave information on just what is happening to the body, brain and soul during these experiences.
B009329ZF2|5.0|the sound effects with surround sound was fantastic. the picture was clean and crisp. the story line was good. that's all
B009LRE040|5.0|Very Dark and way more serious than the other 2.  I loved the Dark Knight, but I like the tone in this one better.  The only thing better in Dark Knight is Ledger's Joker.
B00846REIS|5.0|Was a great book kept you wanting more. Looking forward to reading the next book. Maybe a little along the lines of 50 Shades but not exactly the same
B000YHG72E|4.0|To really enjoy this movie, you must be over 70 years of age, or under 16 years of age.  The old timers will enjoy spotting the characters from television of 40 years ago, and young people will enjoy the plot line.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Good for touching up and maintaining smaller knives. Works quickly to bring your blade back to working sharpness after use. Not for Skandi blades as this sharpener is designed for beveled edges. Small size makes it easy to carry (and lose). Well made. This is always in my truck glovebox and used regularly.
0345803485|5.0|great packing job loved the book, all the fam read it, the story line great  christson gray cgcgcgc. cgcgcgc.cgcgcg<br /><br />thanks
B0036FOGTW|5.0|Considered and critical view of foreign aid (to Africa) and why such aid must stop as it is applied today. Ms. Moyo has examined why foreign aid does not work, has not worked, and will not work in the future to alleviate poverty in Africa. The book is written for lay persons such as myself but it is replete with cases studies and references sufficient enough for any academic. This should be read by anyone in government aid and anyone considering trying to help the poor. The book offers hope for the future and it lays out a clear and simple plan of action. I wish Ms Moyo was in the US State Department instead of the career bureaucrats there now who have wasted billions of US aid dollars only to make things worse for those who need help the most.
0345803507|5.0|great great great great great great loved the book  loved it loved it  loved it dont know what to say
B001N1DPDE|4.0|Very well made and an exceptional tool for bushcraft or survival. Fours stars instead of 5 because of three personal preferences. 1. The entire blade is painted black. It's ugly and I removed it as soon as I received the knife. The sheath is lame. I updated mine. 3. The top of the blade needs to be ground about 1&#34; along the top slightly to facilitate using a fire steel. As it comes, the paint and slightly rounded top surface doesn't work very well for striking a steel or flint. Don't get me wrong. This is quality tool that will do most bush work without breaking a sweat.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Got the free version first, but were so inthralled with it that the free levels didn't suffice.  Love that there are multiple challenges for each level, so we get to revisit them. Also like the trophy room, with it's additional challenges. Last night, when we first met the Trollfoot, all four of us screamed, then laughed ourselves silly!
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I downloaded just the first episode to see what I thought. I enjoyed it so much I&#34;m going back for more.
B0015XHQTE|5.0|Came on time as expected with no damages. I love the Dirty Harry series and this was great buy for me and my sons.
B008S80OU2|4.0|Great boxset, really. The only complaint is that CDs don't have inner plastic cases, so scratches may appear pretty soon.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Like others reviewing here, I hate this mobile version.  For th first week it worked very similarly to the desktop version. Then it switched to a less functional view that shows only a limited number of posts in the newsfeed.  I will uninstall and acess FB through the web interface until this is fixed.
B004LWZW8I|4.0|I have the movie 300 and like it so I thought I'd try this one.  It's a good movie and do recommend it.
B000ZHS3E8|5.0|Hard core science fiction fans will not be let down by this flick.  Acting, plot and special effects note worthy.
B00004TS0E|5.0|Growing up my family watched this movie every year for Christmas, so I thought I'd get it for my granddaughter to watch.  She will not watch black and white so I bought this.  I recommend.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters as soon as it was released after a long wait...I have watched this movie many times and will watch it many more times before it wears out.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|I've got one thru three so when four came out of course I had to have it.  Now I can not wait for five.  I love SOA and I recommend all of them.
B00824ZJ84|4.0|Rebecca has a great instrument.  I look forward to hearing more from her.  The songs are short but let me wanting more.
B00AGDVWDK|5.0|The Bishop's Wife is one of my favorite holiday films. It has a wonderful message about love, family and the things that are really important to a full and happy life. It is also quite witty. Cary Grant is just so good at subtle humor. What more can you say? The DVD keeps going in and out of print, so the digital copy was a good option for us this year. The video quality is good. I have no complaints.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Excellent adventure game. Play was challenging without being too difficult. I did have to use a couple youtube vid hints. What I looooved is that this game doesn't pester you endlessly to leave a review during the game but gives you the option after you're done! Brilliant iCOOLgeeks just brilliant. I hope other game developers take notice. This was my first play of an iCOOLgeeks game. It won't be the last. Keep up the good work!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is a great show and in this season it always got me thinking o crap now i need to wait for another week!
B003EY7IRC|4.0|I have really enjoyed this series.  Shadowfever started out a bit slower and more confusing than I thought the rest of the books did, but it definately picked up the pace.  Dreading finishing the book...unless there is a 6th book I don't know about? lol
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It tells me everything I need to know is a simple format.  An excellent program.  I look it up first thing every morning.
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|Not as good as the Angry Birds.  Would like it if Amazon offered a free game of Angry Birds Star Wars.
B005D63ICI|1.0|DVDs would not work. Tired in 3 different DVD players and in my laptop, would not work in any, awful waste of money!
B002OR0RP0|3.0|An exercise in predictability and tired cliches. I kept asking my kid if we had seen it already... The animation is good, so it is watchable. ONCE.
B007ZXK08C|2.0|Just about suitable for the beach--well-written but trite. Hopeless unbelievable ending. No. 1 on the best-seller list? Who's paying whom?
B007VUA7VO|4.0|This is the best app I have seen and used for monitoring battery life on any device. It's clear and concise, and highly accurate. I would highly recommend this app for any Kindle Fire User.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This was a great episode which is scarier than most horror films that come out today in the movie theater.
B0073XV2W2|3.0|This book was okay. Not as engaging as previous works, Daemon & Freedom. I had a difficult time finishing this one. I found the ideas and concepts in the novel intriguing, but I had a difficult time relating to, or caring about, the characters.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|I'm docking a star because the different jet packs dont change the physics of flight. That just seems silly to me. Otherwise it's a fun game and the in-app purchase options don't ruin the game if you don't buy.
B00AA7O22U|2.0|High hopes for an awful movie.  Very disappointing. Poor writing and story line with recycled one liners.  The story isn't very good and leaves more to be desired.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Easy read with so much passion<br />I wish Charlie was a real person I think we could relate on many things. I hope the movie is just as awesome
B007B6T3K4|4.0|This album take opens up new possibilities for Xandria. The addition of the operatic voice of Manuela Kraller only adds the bands already great sound. If you are a fan of old Epica (ie Phantom Agony and Consign to Oblivion), Tarja Turunen (ex singer for Nightwish), and Floor Janson (Revamp and Afterfoever) you will love this album.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Eastwood  impeccably plays out the theme of the forsaken and redeemed.  His character, Walt, a grisly racist Korean War vet, is haunted with what he did as a soldier and confounded at his failure as a father.  He knows he is flawed and we see his principles and virtues come to the surface as he confronts basic issues of right, wrong, wisdom, and paternalism with his young Asian neighbor and family. His guidance is eventually transformed into a force of good which allows him to redeem his past sins, all through getting involved with the conflicts of his Southeast Asian neighbors and a strained relationship with a young Catholic priest who is goading his character to repent, for this was his deceased wife's dying wish. As you would expect from Eastwood, he runs any ideas of  right, wrong, good and evil through his facade of racism, self destruction, and intolerance. He knows his life's end is near and as a hero he makes that sacrifice which redeems him personally and leaves us sad and hopeful. Do watch it.
B004LCNO3S|5.0|these are three very good movies and would suggest buying them.their full of action,matt damen at his best.i'm glad i bought them
B0053O89RY|5.0|What can I say?  If you've watched it, you know. If you haven't, WATCH IT!  It's brilliant. Amazing writing, casting, just all-around quality entertainment on the small screen.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|I bought this movie as a family gift. My wife and I have seen separate parts of the movie, but never all the way through. Last night we watched it together, and it is now a family favorite for the holidays.<br /><br />We particularly liked the fact that there are two CD's, a black and white and a colored version. What we really like about the colored version is that it does not have the digital remastered HD quality that all of the movies are going these days - we feel that this process ruins great films.<br /><br />We highly recommend this movie!
B007704HO6|5.0|James and Bob have my heart, this is such a touching book, it is an excellent read with a Happy Ending.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very developed characters and was a quick read. Rather surprised at the ending; did not figure it out like I usually do. Overall a good, steady read. Makes you look around and wonder about people. ;)
0812982622|1.0|Why such graphic violence?  Is that really necessary?  After 200 pages I was having nightmares and threw the book in the recycling bin.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|Same as all the other recent transformers movies, dull and bland, completely emotionless. The story lacks excitement, and only the occasionally good special effects made me sit through it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|LOTS OF FUN TO PLAY ON MY KINDLE.<br />I RECOMMEND IT  IF YOU LIKE REGULAR SOLITAIRE YOU WILL LIKE THIS.
B001OGWY1W|3.0|I had really enjoyed the first Dark Knight in the series. This one, the second in the series was OK. But remember, I'm much older then most of your audience. I'm sure the younger folks liked it more.<br />Theresa
B009FZHYKU|3.0|This season is not as interesting as the first two in my opinion, but still entertaining. There is still the possibility that it may get more interesting the second part of the season.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Good...not great...read it because Grisham is author.....so far fetched...do not know whether I would rec to a friend to read or not
B009NQKPUW|2.0|No plot, but good effects can't make up for that. Seemed only a carrier to convey &#34;alternate creation theory&#34; lol.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|How great is it to have this classic on blu-ray.  I already own the set but the option to have it in Blu-ray, I think that's a must with the classics.
B0095R64AO|3.0|Cute movie and moments, I like Jason Segal.  Seen this storyline before tho.  I was entertained, but not as good as I expected.  I was hoping for more of a bridesmaid comedy.
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|My grandsons are great fans of Wimpy Kid and really enjoyed the movie. Great family movie for kids and adults alike.
B009RI4FRU|2.0|A very boring movie, that was over rated.  Cute kid acting, but did not like this type of movie at all.
0810989956|5.0|This was a gift for two boys, 8 and 9 years old. The boys love the Wimpy Kid series and this book was such a hit because they could make their own stories and use their imaginations, almost a contest to see you could make the Kid the best! What a great way to get these young children to read and enjoy themselves at the same time.
B0081L37Z0|2.0|Stupid acting spoofs, especially when Jonah Hill meets his mothers friend.  The best part of movie was Johnny Depp and his cameo appearance!!!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|My only disappointment is the fact that the story is not over. I don't know if that was it or if there is more coming. I liked the pictures and how deftly they were used. They added to the story without being cumbersome. However I do not want to wait forever before the story is done, so I am going to
B009KHDT0C|2.0|johnny johnny johnny, please care about your career again and stop making Tim Burton movies!!  Stupid movie.  Really Stupid Movie.
B005CKPQ7A|5.0|Lots of twists!  This show is so unpredictable, it's addicting!  The actors have a great rapport which comes across in every scene.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|A silly sort of movie...Mostly about Meryl trying to get her hubby to sleep with her.  Steve Carrel was pretty numb in his acting.
B00AMBK6J2|2.0|We had heard good things about this movie and we were excited to watch it, however we were quite disappointed with it. It was not as funny as we had hoped!!
B00A6N8F4Y|2.0|I expected better from Oliver Stone..  Lots of nudity and violence.  I would not watch again and would have been disappointed if seen at a theater.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Harry Bosch is my hero. He never gives up and he always speaks for the victim and finds the reasons why.
B008JH5CVS|3.0|I like Guy Pearce but not this movie.  I can't even remember that much about it...it was so boring.  I would not recommend or watch again.
B00AA7O22U|3.0|If your bored and want an action movie to watch to kill time, then this is a good movie to watch.
B008M34INW|2.0|I did not watch all of this movie.  The Roku quality was very poor and I became bored quick with the storyline.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Great science fiction film; would be excited for a sequel if made!  The movie makes more sense if you see it uncut, so at least watch the DVD extras or the director's cut if possible as it removes some otherwise inconsistencies.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|This movie is a must be just to watch Tom Cruise!  He is great as a rock star.  I do not like musicals, but it was fun hearing the actors sing and the 80s music.  Julianne Hough was annoying tho.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|The references to all the entertainment from the 80's is amazing. I would also suggest listening to the audio version if you can get it, Will Wheaton does an excellent job.
B0031RAOVY|4.0|It's not too often these days in which you get a feature film on an animal that hasn't been personified.<br /><br />I really liked the genuine acting and the subtle nature of how the dog fits the film. It's obvious that Hachi is the centerpiece, but not annoyingly so. I do wonder if these dogs are all that dedicated to their master.<br /><br />I'm not fond of crying as much as I did (which Disney does too often) and it was a bit of a thin script too. Then again, I'm not sure how it could be made better though as it is a simple story which doesn't need to be overdone.
0618871713|5.0|The is the first &#34;graphic&#34; novel I have enjoyed and the first time I thought the illustrations added to the enjoyment of the work. In fact this book has wonderful depth and the illustrations are an integral part of a superb whole.
B0085YNML2|4.0|This game is more for children but is cute and fun :) I would recommend this this game to my friends.
B00AMBK6J2|5.0|I loved this movie.  I have to watch it again.  While my husband and I watched this, our son's oversized teddy bear was in the rocker.
B009NOVCSS|5.0|It's the Rolling Stones and basically all of the Rolling Stones, therefore why do you even need a review? They're the Stones.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I would reccomend this book and video to everyone, adults and children. My family enjoyed the Polar Express. We loved it so much we went to Durango, CO (in our PJs and rode the Polar Express, which really brought the book to life.
B00632HWOG|5.0|More than anything, I like being able to access my e-mail on my kindle rather than my phone since the screen is much larger. Easier to type on also.
067144901X|5.0|Great baby board book!  My baby loves the farm animals and animal sounds and simple storyline.  She reads this over and over every day at 10 months and has loved it since around 6 months.  Sometimes when she is fussy during diaper changes I will recite the story and it calms her down so that is cool too!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|More than anything, I like being able to access FB on my kindle rather than my phone since the screen is much larger.  Easier to type on also.
B005V4FJC4|4.0|Love Zooey's retro versions of some Christmas classics!  It has been great adding this album to my Christmas playlist this year.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Really good book.At times, not so much but I really love you Suzanne and I hope the movies come out soon. I recommend this book. (Suggest u read hunger games then catching fire) :)
0689835604|5.0|We got this for my baby at around 6 months and she loved it then but constantly wanted to eat the flaps. This is not a board book so we didn't pull it out for her much until around 8 months when she stopped teething on the flaps.  Even at about 8 months she was really good at lifting the flaps herself and now at 10 months she is starting to associate the body parts in the book with her body parts.  We always touch her foot, hand, etc when we find that part in the book.  The other day she lifted her own shirt to find her belly button which was cute but also shows us that she is learning.  We used clear packaging tape to mend a tear from an excited baby lifting a flap too hard and it probably wouldn't be a bad idea to do that to all of the flaps to make this book last.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|Best book in the whole entire world. Nothing can ever be compared to it it made me cry laugh and smile all at the same time and I wish (my daughter) Sam could be mine.
B001BKTEZA|5.0|After reading a portion each night, I fell asleep thinking how fortunate I am.  I have such regrets for not reading The Grapes of Wrath many years ago.  I was motivated to purchase it because of the Ken Burns' recent TV series.  Very informative about the period (except that people I have met from that part of the country say that the Dust Bowl era is not over) and the relationships among the characters were outstanding.  Mrs. Joad and I have a few things in common - mostly trying to keep things together. Have heard that some readers feel that The Grapes Of Wrath may be the best book of the last century.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Waking Up Married was a good love story without being real mushy.  It kept you guessing what the characters were going to do next.
B000QGAU4E|5.0|This movie is action packed, visually stunning, emotionally jarring, and very thought provoking. I've watching it many times and still love it.
B005XN0SGU|3.0|Not bad.. but I do have issues with it being extremely slow on my Kindle Fire.  Book shelf scrolling is PAINFULLY slow(screen takes 5-10 seconds to catch up with swipe).  But it does what it's supposed to.
B001CTGQBK|5.0|The service was excellent on this product and it arrived in a timely manor.  Would recommend this dealer and would not hesitate to use again.
B009DKFST6|5.0|Pitbull delivers in this dance paced songs. Miami sound on steroids. I like and am enjoying.  Makes Christmas shopping much more fun, listening to the Big Man in black.
6305428042|5.0|i remember ever Halloween as a kid watching this and now i can watch when ever i want and my kids will see it one day
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Makes me want to find a place like this as an alternative to a care facility. The acting was good.
B00992CF6W|5.0|omg. i luv this app its graet and i hav a great time using it. my friends like it too.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Love love love this book.  After several reccomendations I am sorry I did not read it sooner.  Kept me guessing all the time.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Not as engrossing as 1st season but then again the 1st season sets a very high standard to compare this to. I give it 4 stars because it's still a good watch, but not mind blowing.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Real Thriller - the action on the skyscraper had me on the very edge of my seat. Enjoy this movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Can not wait for the season to begin this January. The writers are on their game with the storyline.<br />Set your DVR's.
1449410243|5.0|Our cats thought we were going mad when we sat down together and started reading this book and they'd be plotting an assassination attempt if they knew how well the author knows cats.  Not since Kliban's classic \\"CAT,\\" have we laughed so hard.  Everything in this book is true. As lifelong cat-slaves, we recognized each feline maneuver listed in the book.  It's absolutely delightful, the perfect gift for any cat lover.  Though be warned: you must tell your cat it's really a book about dog behavior. Best wrap it in a fake cover, too, because believe me, you don't want your kitty catching on. They hate to be laughed at and their revenge is not served cold, but with a side of claws.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I enjoyed the first book of Fifty Shades.  This second one was not quite as good, but I still enjoyed it.
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|The movie was pretty decent and the FX was top notch but there wasn't a great deal of character development although an attempt was made to do so. Although I have played all the Halo games the movie was a bit hard to follow because there was not much explanation of what was happening from one event to another.<br /><br />Other than that if you like fantasy movie's this is a good one to watch just don't expect a great deal from it.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|I hope the sequel, if there is one, will be better.  I'm a Bourne fan, and this fell flat.  So much potential...I hope it was setting the stage because all of a sudden, it was over.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have been catching up on this series and this is the easy way to do it.  User friendly, no &#34;loading &#34; pauses.  Its seamless.  Worth paying for for.

B00371XIJE|5.0|This is really a good movie based upon a true story.  It shows how much a dog is devoted to his master.  Loved it.

B007URVZJ6|5.0|Building Your Book For Kindle provided all the technical information and guidelines to building a book for publication on Kindle. It was easy to understand.

B0019UGYK0|5.0|This is a fantastic movie! Paul Newman is always a winner and the rest of the cast is excellent as well. My husband loves the car washing scene especially, as I'm sure most men do. Terrific story, wonderful acting. never a dull moment.
B001KZG99A|5.0|This is a really good movie.  It has action and humor.  A great combination.  Definitely one of Robert Downey Jr.'s best characters.  This movie is for the kid in all of us that still believes in superheroes.

B00AMSLRAC|5.0|This game is fun and different. My daughter enjoys all the Dr. PANDA games. The only slight complaint is I wish there were fruits/veggies to grow. The cycle goes by fast and my daughter will say \\"I already grew that\\" when the same item comes up again. But this is def worth purchasing!
B0087GZ8YW|4.0|This is another thoroughly enjoyable read by Ian Rankin. The story develops with increased complexity and holds the reader's attention throughout.  The only &#34;weakness&#34; is the rather rapid denouement, which perhaps has more to do with the economics of publishing, price, and the perceived length of book that a reader will purchase, rather than the author's skill.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|When I think of great pop records, does it get any better than this?  Well, no, it doesn't.  Sara B's Little Voice is one of the best, most consistent, and most listenable records I've ever heard.  It's somewhat rare to find a record where every song is good, but this is one example.  Sara has true talent, and it shines through on this record.  She writes all her own music, has a great voice, and is a great pianist - a true musical triple threat.<br /><br />Part of what makes Little Voice so great is that there is musical diversity in the songs on the record, and by that I mean that each song provides a different sound, different theme, different tempo.  She doesn't repeat herself on the songs, and there is no filler on the album.  &#34;Long Song&#34; is probably the most famous song on the record, and rightfully so, but many of the other songs are just as great.  &#34;Vegas&#34; and &#34;Bottle It Up&#34; provide some sultry funk, &#34;Fairytale&#34; is a perfect piece of pop, and &#34;City&#34; and &#34;Gravity&#34; are soft and beautiful.  To me, the album is largely upbeat, positive, and good-spirited, and who doesn't want to listen to music that makes you feel good?<br /><br />So what are you waiting for?  Get this album!  This is one of my all time favorite albums, and you won't be disappointed - unless you have an aversion to great music.<br /><br />Lastly, if you get a chance to see her live, go for it.  I saw her live at the Boston Pavilion last year, and she really delivers the goods live!

B008AK8FHM|3.0|The book, Proof of Heaven,  gave great insight into the brain.  But I got boughed down in the medical aspect althought he did a good job of explaining on layman's terms.  I guess I was looking more on heaven itself and our passed on loved ones.

B002SRQ214|5.0|I needed a little more speed from my system and this provided it within my budget. I would advise that you opt for a quieter CPU fan. The stock fan that came in the box sounded like an airplane taking off and was nerve racking. I picked up a Coolermaster 212 which is super quiet (and super BIG) and keeps the CPU 10C cooler. I have not Overclock the CPU, but I didn't buy it for that purpose. It is running great at the stock speed of 3.4Ghz.

B009GX7IRA|5.0|I enjoy watching this show. I find that the actors work well together to make this show enjoyable. If you like law enforcment show i would recommend watching this show.
B00AHSINKO|4.0|Well worth watching but its hard to watch a bad marriage, even harder to watch a dull one. If she was throwing things at him at least there would be a little action.  But action is what this marriage was totally lacking. Going to counseling is hard, watching others go is even harder. The characters are likeable (in their own way), the acting was superb, the storyline could have boosted a little with more funny anecdotes. But as the title says.... Hope Springs.
B002PZC8BM|5.0|This show is interesting. If you like law enforcment type shows this is a good one to watch. It brings a twist to the normal police work.

B00A6PD8RQ|4.0|The animation, especially facial expressions and dialect were great. Good story...little hard for me to understand some of the Scottish accents...<br />Thought the rowdy, brainless Scottish clans were way overdone and distracting... often its the case with movies for young people...and their parents....there is something for everybody which is patronizing and dilutes the narrative flow.
B00A6N8YTU|1.0|I didn't watch the whole movie. The beginning was a waste of time.. I think I stopped it right when she got kidnapped.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|5 Stars<br /><br />\\"The moment my lips touch yours, it will be your first kiss. Because if you've never felt anything when someone's kissed you, then no one's ever really kissed you.  Not the way I plan on kissing you.\\"<br /><br />I had the immense pleasure of reading an advanced copy of Colleen Hoover's Hopeless.  This book, this multi-layered book, made me laugh and cry and catch my breath.<br />This is a different ball of wax from Hoover's two previous works (Slammed and Point of Retreat).  This is an adult themed, darker novel which deals with some hard hitting issues and is told with as much sensitivity as is possible for Hoover to have written.  Holder is a modern day Sir Lancelot with a troubled past and a fierce temper. Sky is fiercely independent and determined to spend her senior year at a public high school, having been formerly home schooled by her adoptive mother for her entire education. She is emotionally withdrawn from affairs involving her heart.  She has mastered the art of separating the physical from the emotional. These two individuals collide and this intersection catapults unforeseen unavoidable events.  Both have histories deeply embedded in their subconscious minds that they would prefer to remain hidden.<br /><br />I did not think I could love a character of Hoover's more than Will Cooper from Slammed/ Point of Retreat. How she proved me wrong with Dean Holder.  I so wanted to embrace him and let him rest his head and all his troubles on my shoulders.  He is the most steadfast protector of Sky's heart that one could wish for. Sky has survived and has actually managed to thrive against insurmountable odds.  Hoover layers shock upon shock and revelation with each subsequent chapter.  Just when you think all is revealed, that you can unbuckle that seat belt and put the car in park, she adds another twist.  Sometimes it makes you bawl your eyes out; sometimes it makes you walk away for a moment.  Sometimes you find it necessary to take your own \\"chapter break\\" before continuing on with this bitter sweet journey.  There are times when your heart breaks and times of sheer terror and loathing that comes over you in waves. Take a breath and keep reading.  These two have to finish this journey and you have to accompany them to see it through. Hopeless, in my opinion, is one of the best books I have read this year.  I dreaded turning the last few pages, as I did not want it to end. What an outstanding work this is from Hoover!  Sky and Holder will stay with you long after their story is told.\\"chapter break\\" before continuing on with this bitter sweet journey.

B000HKW7E0|5.0|Great movie ... It is rated pg-13 for a reason, though - not appropriate for younger children.  Very funny for a mature audience!
B0076DELIG|5.0|This is typicle Harry Bosch. Always great reading. Ater the last pageis done, you wish it had a few more chapters.

B004W2UBYW|1.0|As much as I looked forward to reading this, the author was too repetitive in his verbage like the other reviewers stated.  I couldn't make it thru the 2nd half.  I so wanted to learn more about this extraordinary man with so much vision but this book just couldn't hold my attention.
0783229526|5.0|90's classic, about the 70's. Depp is just simply unbelieveable in this movie acting as Dr.Thompson. This is bat country.
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is the best show on TV not just because I love zombie movies but because the production, the acting and the show as a whole is done very well. It is different enough from the comic books that is truly enjoyable.
B009AZZEU2|5.0|The basswork is the best ever and mostly takes the lead on this album. &#34;Rowing&#34; is a fantastic gospel-esque song. &#34;Attrition&#34; might be the best Motorhead song in 10 years.
B008CJ0KI8|5.0|Frank Ocean is pure genius. If you don't have this album, you don't know really good music when you hear it.

B005HJU7HA|5.0|What a wonderful and complete collection, and at an awesome price!  Don't pass up this deal if you or someone you know is a Sherlock Holmes fan.
B008NBEY3C|5.0|I recently received this box set (about ten days ago), and have been slowly going through it for my daily listening.  I have to say that this is a great set for anyone who appreciates the artistry of Murray Perahia.  I want to comment a bit on two aspects: Firstly on the packaging, and secondly on the recordings themselves.<br /><br />I have to admit that the physical size and weight of this boxed set is quite massive.  Yet it is also very distinguished.  In the set you receive a very nicely laid out book that contains ALL of the liner notes from the recordings (the original LP notes as well as the inserts from those recordings that were initially released on CD).  The book is very well done, containing interviews with Perahia, as well as reproductions of the cover art from all of the recordings.  You get all of the information from the CDs (Recording dates, locations, track numbers,etc.)  The CDs themselves are in individual cardboard sleeves which also have the original cover art.  I really like this because I recently purchased DG's \\"The Baroque Box\\" set.  (I'll do a separate review of that, but one thing I don't like about that is it does not have the original cover art for the recordings.)  Having this, to me provides a sense of pride, integrity, and vision for the releases.  In addition to the book and the CDs, there are also DVD performances/interviews.  So, there is a lot going on here, but definitely worth the price.<br /><br />Next, just a few comments on the recordings themselves.  Keep in mind as of this writing, I've only had the set for about 10 days, so clearly I haven't listened to everything.  What I have listened to though, has been nothing short of lovely.  I've focused on the Mozart Piano Concerti, as well as some Chopin and Beethoven Piano Sonatas.  The Mozart Concerti are amazing.  One thing that I was curious about was the mastering of these CDs.  Apparently there have been multiple masterings of these recordings, which have received mixed reviews.  However, I am very pleased not only with the sounds, but also, the interpretations.  There is a great balance between soloist and orchestra, and the result is astonishing.  There is an intimacy present that I have not heard in other recordings of these pieces.  Regarding the Beethoven Sonatas, my favorite still is Kempff's set on DG, but Perahia's recordings show a very intelligent, and well thought out approach to these works.<br /><br />Ultimately of course, one has to decide whether to spend money on a set like this.  If you have most of his recordings already, it probably doesn't make economic sense to purchase this, unless you want the recordings in the re-mastered sound.  However, I have to say that this is a great edition to my library and the artistry of this great pianist is definitely shown in this box set.
B009VB97EY|5.0|I loved this movie.  I would recommend to mature adiences.  This movie has great entertainment value and I would watch over and over.
B005S9ELM6|5.0|A fine film in my opinion that I have seen a few times, will see it again at the dollar theater when it gets there, and will buy the DVD.  All the cast, main roles, bit roles, and extras do an  excellent job. John Goodman and Alan Arkin do a great job providing most of the comic relief in this film to the tenseness that was existent during the 1979-1981 Iranian Hostage Crisis. Kudos to Bryan Cranston, Bob Gunton, Philip Baker Hall, Ben Affleck, Kyle Chandler, Victor Garber, Clea DuVall, Scoot McNairy, Kerry Bishe, Tate Donovan, Christopher Denham, Rory Cochrane, Zeljko Ivanek, Richard Kind as well as all of the other recognizable faces in this production.  Affleck, Arkin, Goodman, & chandler carry the movie very well along with Garber and the 6 \\"House Guest\\" actors, not to mention the actors who portray the Canadian Ambassador's Housekeeper & Iranian Students of the revolutionary \\"Komiteh\\".  There are actual news clips woven into the film.  Many of the characters portrayed are real life people. I was a very young US Airman stationed in Europe during this whole period from 1979-81 and this film brought it all back to me about what was going at the time in Europe and the Middle East. My wing's mission was as a strike fighter unit and we took turns with our sister wing taking deployments to Southern Turkey not far from Syria and Northern Iran during this entire period. I'm not defending the man, but there was really nothing that President Carter could do. This was 4 years after the end of the Vietnam War & our Armed Services were totally unprepared for this type of situation. The one operation, Operation Eagle Claw, they did try (which was referenced in the film as being in the preparation stage by the Delta Force teams) ended in abject failure. I remember a lot of this because Major Richard Bakke was from my home town of Long Beach, California. As a navigator, he was one of the Air Force MC-130 aircrew members to die in April 1980 at the Desert One site near Tehran, .Ben Affleck and company did a really fine job in this film of portraying the state of the world at this point in time.  So in the immortal words of the films tagline (paraphrased), \\"Argo.....(see it) Yourself\\"  LOL and thoroughly enjoyed it for comedy and drama!!  A Real Fine Effort From All Involved.
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Pentatonix has created, with this album, an entree that underscores their artistry and brilliance. The group has a unique sound with unbelievable range. The way they mix a song is such a treat, refreshing classics without adulterating what makes it a classic. This is on full display in &#34;O Come, O Come Emmanuel&#34; led by bass Avi. We're not used to hearing Avi lead the group as he's usually the foundation of their harmonies playing a supporting, but indispensable, role. This pairing, however, results in nothing short of a luxurious and engrossing rendition of this gorgeous hymn. The song is dynamic and tender inspiring a visceral response. Be sure to listen with a good set of headphones or premium sound system.<br /><br />Here's an album with real staying power; I'll come back to this year after year. I’m certain this album will keep calling me long after the holiday season. Every track is worthy of our attention. Best $6 I've ever spent! Like their first album, my only complaint is there aren't enough songs. I suppose it's a quality vs. quantity situation. As long as they keep creating music like this, they'll continue to earn my respect, my money and, most importantly, valuable space on my music device.
B009ZAY8MM|4.0|Of course, the highlight of the album is Carol of the Bells, but all in all, Pentatonix has a strong, clean sound that makes it a joy to listen to.  They do not &#34;jazz it up&#34; too much, but do managed to arrange each song just enough to leave their own mark.
B00A6PD8RQ|2.0|The movie was enjoyable but the &#34;HD&#34; quality couldn't even be considered SD quality.  There have been no issues streaming other HD movies through Amazon but for some reason the quality on Brave was so poor many scenes were barely recognizable.
0062068423|5.0|Typical Nesbo story, slow to start, difficult to follow, but fun to look for clues.  Love Harry Hole and hated Ellen being killed.

0385344333|4.0|Typical Lee Child novel about Jack Reacher.  I kept thinking that I had read it before.  He needs to change something so it doesn't feel stale.
B007CGLRWA|3.0|The story was so sad.  I know that things can be bad in life but the only ray of hope was at the end? Do teachers really feel this way?  Do children really behave this way? Too extreme.<br /><br />With that said, the performances were excellent. I felt everything everyone seemed to be experiencing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Incredible, highly recommend.  Best one yet.  Never thought I'd like this series, but it was a nice ride.  Thank you
B000YHG72E|5.0|I just love this movie!  I have a 16 year old and a 3 year old that also love it!  You just cannot go wrong with Will Ferrell & Christmas!
B000FC2L1E|4.0|She just keeps me reading... What else is there to say about Gabaldon? She has the gift of keeping you interested... thousands of pages in and I still want more!
B005LAII3A|4.0|Total Armageddon would have been a better title for this one. I was grabbed by the dream sequence and the dazzling special effects never seemed to let me go. I found the action sequences entertaining but it had a brainless Michael Bay feel to it with a few lines of wisdom thrown in (e.g. Farrell talking to a coworker about doing what they're told without questioning whether it's right or wrong).<br /><br />The good: the special effects. The world of this Total Recall might not be Mars but it's a mesmerizing dystopian display. The Fall was very cool.<br /><br />The bad: the premise wasn't entirely believable, perhaps because it wasn't fully developed, while viewers may find they have little emotional connection to the characters. A big part of this was because Farrell was sort of like Rambo; I never really feared for his life. It always amazes me in how these types of movies the good guys can be fired at 1,000 times but most of the bullets miss, and the ones that hit often knick a shoulder blade, hand, or foot.<br /><br />The ugly: Um, who's idea was it to have a tri-breasted woman? He needs to be fired.<br /><br />The bottom line: if you're looking for a bombastic, summer-style, Michael Bay-type, brainless, fun movie to take you out of reality for a few hours, this one is for you!<br /><br />-Raeden Zen

0439023491|5.0|Let's get this out of the way - 5 stars for all three of the books in the Hunger Games Trilogy. However, as a student and practitioner of archery, the consistent incorrect use of the term \\"sheath of arrows\\" was like a stone in my shoe.<br /><br />A bundle of arrows is a sheaf, the device that is used to carry arrows is a quiver. I can't believe that the proofreader or copy editor missed this... I try not to let it bother me too much -- the story is so compelling, and so well written.
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I enjoyed this book greatly as I always enjoy John Scalzi. It was delivered wirelessly to my Kindle--love it. Thanks.
B00340I4KG|4.0|Good: Attempt at mature story, ballet-like action sequences from John Woo, amazing performances Nicholas Cage and John Travolta<br /><br />Bad: No reason to choose the Blu-Ray over DVD<br /><br />Oh, John Travolta, never change. Just keep overacting... Oh wait you did change, for the first part of the movie. You imitated Nicholas Cage's typical style for the first quarter of Face/Off when you played FBI Agent Sean Archer. Oh, how are you Mr. Cage! When you started off this movie, you were chewing the scenery as Castor Troy. However, things got back to normal for you in the second act.<br /><br />The whole plot of the movie is that Sean Archer needs to switch faces and voices with Castor Troy to go undercover and find out where Troy hid this bomb. However, Troy wakes up, kills everyone who knew Archer was undercover as Troy, then steals Archer's face and voice, and goes around pretending to be Archer. Cue gunfights and actual character development.<br /><br />I admit, your movie is goofy. However, I like how director John Woo managed to add some artsy (though kind of obvious) symbolism for the dilema of having to kill the man wearing your face. Also, the fact that your characters were trying to live the lives of the enemy was extremely interesting. There were some missed opportunities, storywise, but I didn't mind. I do kind of wish the Blu-Ray had some more features.<br /><br />Oh, sure, I understand. You two have important things to do.<br /><br />I'm not crazy... I'm an internet reviewer!<br /><br />That's even worse?<br /><br />Oh.... okay.<br /><br />Forever alone....<br /><br />Forever alone....

B004G600A4|5.0|I gave the movie Tangled five stars. It is a wonderful story, with mousic, song by excellent performers. The horse Max , is a favorite charictor, he is a hoot. The anamation , the voices, the music were excellent.I would recoment this movie to everyone. `
B003YL4LYI|2.0|Too many personas, too many events, too many quirky sudden changes and revelation, too few plot advances, to meaty cliffhangers...
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|The only way to describe this movie is hilarious. I'm disappointed with myself for not seeing this in the theater. I would have loved to have seen it on the big screen. Wether you saw this in the theater or not, this is one movie you need to see, or own. Each of the characters are so unique and likable thaht you forget its an animated film. You will laugh from the opening scene all the way to the ending credits. Steve Carellas the voice of Mr. Gru, is at first a despicable and unlikable villain that you find yourself rooting for the other guy, but when he has a &#34;lightbulb&#34; moment and he gets involved with 3 little orphans, you find yourself rooting for him instead. The &#34;minions&#34;, who were my  favorites , will keep you laughing with all their silly antics throughout this movie. Whether you have children or not, don't pass this one up. You will not be disappointed.
B0086700CM|3.0|I tried to play this game on my optimus v but it crashes. I'm guessing this is due to the fragmented android market where some apps don't work on certain phones even though they download.
B00AE2J5HI|2.0|The movie was OK but there was not much plot line.  I found myself with questions afterwards.  Probably worth the $4 I paid.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I really like this software it's awesome seeing your pc on your phone especially if you go somewhere you can't lug around your computer to like the bathroom or the garage. This software solves that problem!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|A scientist has a NDE.  He sure did place himself on a pedestal when he wrote this book.  Maybe he thinks he is the only one that can explain NDE because he is a doctor.  Completely lacking any HEART!
B006C1DH92|5.0|I like this game more then the original fruit ninja since the Puss in Boots character makes it very entertaining with his quips everytime you get a combo going or mess up. Definitely would recommend this and it's compatible with optimus v.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|Regardless of how things are at any given time...there is always hope!  Great acting - love Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones...uplifting story.
0525953728|5.0|This is such a great true story and so well written you may want to start reading it on a Saturday morning so you don't miss too much sleep (or work) it is too good to put down.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|I like the movie itself and the storyline. However I'm not a big fan of Kristen Stewart. I don't know what people see in her and she seems emotion-less in most of her acting.
B005LAII1C|5.0|I loved this movie but for anyone thinking this cute little bear could not be too bad for kids watch it your self first. I am glad I did. Rough and foul comedy genius.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I thought this was very good. Usually the sequels aren't that good but this was much better than I thought it was going to be.
0547569653|5.0|my wife is a runner, I gave it to her as a gift, she found it very useful and instructive
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|Loved all these movies and it was a hit with my son! Hope to see another one come out also.
1400079144|5.0|there are no words to describe this &#34;masterpiece&#34;, one of the best books written by Dan Brown, I read it three times, and it was great every single time, waiting for the next one...
B009SQRL4U|5.0|This was actually very cute and hilarious. I loved the generations of Santa Clauses and how things were upgraded as the years went on.
B0046UBPG8|5.0|I had to buy this movie for a communication class for college, it's funny and realistic at the same time...
B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Wasn't as funny as I thought it would be but still cute. I was worried the zombies busting out of their grave was too much for my son but he seemed fine. I however don't think it was good for him to try and grasp the concept that the little girl had been hung to death so if I knew that I wouldn't have let him watch it.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Typical Vince Flynn, grabs you from page one, can't put it down,<br />don't want it to end. Enjoyed it and recommend it.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|This was a very cute movie, a lot of action and having to do with the bond between mother and child. Will watch again.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Easy read. Silly at times. Little suspense. Read<br />if you have nothing else to do. Not a must read but just okay.
B00AA7O22U|5.0|Good movie, good cast, has lots of action. What more could I want? Have to watch it...it's go Chuck Norris.
B0055OK2T0|5.0|Unseen forces, powers that be?  This movie did a wonderful job of telling an allegorical story of how Human persistence can move the heart God and change the would be outcome of our lives.  Funny, romantic, suspenseful and intriguing I thoroughly enjoyed and recommend this movie as a must see.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This was a great purchase. I bought this for my family to watch over the Christmas break. We have watched 2-3 episodes each night! My family is glued to it, and hasn't even wanted to take a break one night to go to the movie theater. When we finish we will be anxiously be waiting the start of season 3!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|This book told me everything I needed to know in order to publish my book with Amazon.  The instructional was easy to read and easy to follow.
B005HJU7HA|3.0|It takes a while to load on my tab.  But I love Shelock Holmes so it is a good compromise.
B009K0OL06|5.0|Mad Men has long been my favorite TV show, but Revenge may soon take the title. The writing is terrific - just the right mix of drama and humor. I also very much appreciate the aesthetics of the hair, makeup, and clothing. I can't wait for the season to resume in January 2013. I miss Nolan Ross!
1407115561|5.0|I found this book on a website for girls--but its also a great book for boys! And especially when they like dragons!!
B009GIPDQS|5.0|I didn't want this to finish!  I think it one of the best of his books, and I have read them all.  I reckon it would make a great movie.
B006S08RLU|4.0|This movie was perfect for a French-loving artsy gal like me. I was hooked from the opening scene. I should just go ahead and purchase it, because I know I'll be renting it again.
034580404X|4.0|yeah yea, if you have nothing better to do or you just had an operation and can't get out of bed - read it.  it's satisfying.  I was a little anoyed at people's naughty bits being referred to as \\"down there\\" ... BUT, what really annoys me is notbeing able to figure out why the PAPERBACK is 27.99 and the KINDLE 29.99 ............ !!!  C'mon, Amazon!  you're better than that!
B008ASLNN2|5.0|I love Robert Downey Jr. and Jude Law in this movie. Their chemistry was a perfect combination of smart and classy. The movie itself has enough twists and humor to keep you guessing until the very end.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|It was very easy to download but I'm having trouble with other apps downloading!! I am going to read my book that came with my tablet to see what went wrong with the download of the other apps!!
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|The movie would buffer quite often making it annoying to watch.  This has not happened with other movies streamed so I know it is not an internet issue.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is a cool way to pass the time or exercise a few brain cells .. notice, I said a few.
1423140591|5.0|It was a gift for my son, he made this rating; really liked this book, better than the first one. Overall its a perfect book. People should buy it
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|What an awesome game. Just when you thought Angry Birds could get no better .. BOOM .. they come with a Star Wars edition.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|I love to watch Harry Potter, it was a gift for my son, we all enjoy it. Already have number 7
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I usually hate to write a negative review but I had to write this one! This is by far the worst book I have ever tried to read! I finished about 3/4 of it, even bought the other 2 books before I decided they weren't for me. The thing that scares me is how popular these books are!! The book seemed like it was written by a teenager, using words like \\"down there\\" which really was a turnoff when combined with ADULT vocabulary. The book sends the message that S and M is something to be excited about and very mysterious. It's not mysterious- it's SICK! One \\"wonderful\\" experience for the lead female was being hit by her partner with a whip. He hits her directly on the sweet spot \\"down there\\", and IMMEDIATELY she is experiencing a climax. Now, I don't know about the other ladies who read this smut, but I for one would NOT enjoy being hit by a whip \\"down there\\"! And imagine how skilled her lover was to be able to hit such a small target! The sex scenes are so unrealistic that if someone normal reads this, they will be setting themselves up for some disappointment in the sack! I could feel the \\"walking on eggshells\\" environment the main female character lived in, not wanting to get hit, or spanked..or whatever and ALWAYS playing head games trying to figure out the main male character's mood. I don't know of ANYONE who could (or would) live this way.  I guess I probably would have given this NO stars, but thought I would be kind and give it one. Don't read this, people; don't waste your money! I was fortunate to have bought the Kindle format and was able to return them and get my $30 back.
B009YJEKJK|5.0|For those that remember their original pairing.  This is a fun and happy product where the proceeds go to a worthwhile cause.  I was amazed at times I think they sound as good today as they did 35 years ago.
B000MXPE7O|5.0|Great movie if you like movies about the history of the CIA.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|There are some haters out there for this movie because it isn't what they wanted from a Batman movie, but as I said most of those are just people hating. I am the biggest Batman fan ever. Been a fan since 1974 when I was 2 years old and I loved the movie. Sure I'd love to see more of the Batman I grew up loving, but when you have a film maker like Chris Nolan he is going to kind of do his own thing. He still stayed well within many of the Batman mythos. Some people talk about the plot holes and while there are a couple minor small plot holes, the are nowhere near as big as some may have you believe. eNone are any bigger than you'll see in some of the best movies ever made. Seriously people, plot holes are everywhere in films if you'r looking hard enough. But I don't bother with such things because I am usually to busy trying enjoy a film, not act like a I am so much smarter than everyone else because I spotted a couple little plot holes. They of course never point out these holes because most of them don't exist. I think that most of these people just weren't bright enough or interested to keep track of what what going on. The ending of the movie is visceral and emotional. Of the ending doesn't follow the comic book Batman because there is no ending in the Batman comic books and there never will be. Comic book hero's are perpetually between 27-35 years old. For what it is it's a nice tidy ending to Chris Nolan's Batman trilogy. I still think Batman Begins is as close as we've come to THE Batman on film and it is still my favorite of all the Batman movies, but this one is pretty good and ranks right up there with Nolan's other two Batman flicks. Best comic book/superhero movie of the year. I loved Avengers, but that is light pop corn fluff compared to this movie. I believe TDKR and Dredd 3D were 1,2 with Avengers and Amazing Spider-man also being really good comic book movies.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|No characters to really care about, great special effects, beautiful filming. Plot should have been fleshed out more to create a character to route for or care about. :(
B009D5VNLS|5.0|set to be a classic. A must see for every age!  Great story, lesson and the music is wonderful... you'll want the soundtrack!
B009OYSFDM|5.0|honestly, I can't pretend to be a pro in the heroic stories. But this arrow story is just attractive and thrilling to anyone. Especially for the action fan.<br />Also, I think the discussion of family issues and changes here can be very touching, adding something to this TV series which everyone can thinks about.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Should have ended sooner but was engaging.  Lots of reflections that make you think about life, faith and family. I do recommend it.  Worth the reading or get it in audio.
B009HEMF1M|5.0|I only wish that the kindle display was a true widescreen aspect ratio!  Other than that, great!  I enjoyed it while flying from Denver to San Francisco.
1416599711|4.0|A timeless classic that all should read as youth and adults. Thouroughly enjoyed the whole book. Our book club of twenty women enjoyed it as well.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I have read each one of Michael Connelly's books and they all have been excellent in their own unique way.  Although the characters can sometimes be the same they are never quite the same because, as with the author, they age and Michael has a unique way of allowing that to occur - quite naturally.  If you have not read Michael Connelly, or are perhaps just beginning, do yourself a BIG FAVOR and go back to the beginning and start from his very first book - you will be in for a very fascinating journey.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Deals with issues of sex and intimacy within marriage in a very frank and sometimes amusing way.  This is not a comedy, however.  May touch a nerve!
B00AA7O6QC|3.0|The first one was funnier.  This one was just ridiculous!  The only redeeming quality was Chuck Norris' presence... but even his jokes were forced.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|I expected more ... and I was disappointed.  The acting was fine, but the storyline left something to be desired.
B00742BVW8|5.0|Jet Li is great in this film and the subtitling didn't distract the viewer. Watching a film with subtitles can be difficult at times but this film did it right.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't expect to like this trilogy but downloaded Catching Fire within 5 minutes of reading the first book. Couldn't put it down -- I carried my kindle everywhere to keep reading.
B0071BGOJC|5.0|A wonderful blockbuster of a novel. Interesting characters involved in real historical events, beautifully written,<br />seriously researched.  Hated finishing it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|While this brought everything to a conclusion, I felt that some of the storylines wrapped up too neatly with little of the inner struggles that made the first 2 books so riveting.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I absolutely love Angry Birds.  It has our whole household in competition on who can complete which levels.  Thanks you!
B0083P1QUM|5.0|This book was as riveting as all Cornwell's other Scarpetta Novel's.  Left you wanting more. Could not put my Kindle down.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Really only $.99 for an epic adventure to the red planet. If you ever wanted survival training adventure out of this world look no further. This tale is told from both perspectives of the lone abandoned astronaut without a chance to live clinging on to every scrap of hope and from Earth and how mission control and the media perceives his situation. I appreciated how frank and candid NASA administrators are probably since everyone could die in seconds there is no reason to beat around the bush.  The wit is exceptionally humorous and the jokes hit every funny bone in my skeleton. Could almost feel what it would be like to live in a spacesuit and gasp for every breath while counting down the final seconds to lift off. Get ready for a blast with this space adventure!
B009O2XY12|4.0|Can spend a lot of time trying to burst bubbles.  Easy to use for any age.  I enjoy playing as well as family.
B00AHSMDQY|4.0|Bale has been the best  Batman. The story was a little long in the middle. Overall an excellent  superhero movie.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|Good book!!! I enjoyed it!!! It wasn't one of my favorites - it had a little to much back and forth with Travis and Abby but I'm looking forward to book 2 to see where Travis and Abby go from here!!!
030758836X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book.  The two main characters are both horrible people, but that's what makes the book so delicious and scandalous.  I loved how half way through the book I was sure I was reading a story based on Scott Peterson and then was knocked right outta my seat with a major change of pace.  I enjoyed this one so much I'm reading all of Flynn's other books.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|his is a great way to pass the time and works great on the kindle. I highly recommend this game
B009DCOU9S|5.0|This is a neat game. It is different than the first one. There are hidden places you have open to find objects.  Its not all finding hidden objects. There are match games too. Plus there are different ways to find objects in this. Its not quite as repetitive as the first game. Plus the characters have voices in this. Pay attention to what they say, because they give directions sometimes.
B00AMBH70S|3.0|boring , perdictable action scene. jeremy renner is ok but the can not replace matt damon. i give it 3 stars for renting it but dont waste your money to see it in big screen.
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I just love this guy. This is the 2nd artist from AI I've ever bought the CD for. Kelly Clarkson was the other one. Phillip is going to do great. I love all the songs & am so impressed with his talent. I was the whole time he was on the show. I do see room for growth but given that this is his first CD & his youth, I know he will just get better with age. In this I mean that the songs do start to have a similar sound after listening to the whole cd & so maybe there's not as much depth yet. But I do like each song; just some more than others. I will say that overall this is well worth the listen. He's extremely talented & enjoyable. I want to support a new artist like Phillip Phillips.
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|One of those books I never read as a kid and decided to read before I read 'March', written by the author of 'People of the Book'.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Having read this story many times, it's a season tradition,<br />it was a joy to be able to read it on my indle this year.
B005P06AAO|4.0|A new favorite of my daughter's. she and her friends will get lots of<br />use from this.  Good times for the girls.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I love Harry, Hermione, Ron, Minerva, Albus, Snape, Mad-Eye, Fred, George, Hagrid, Dobby, even Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.  I just love the Potter series and I would definitely tell anyone to read the books and watch the movies!
B004HW7JI8|5.0|What a great show.  Another gift for my daughter.<br />Cant wait for all the other seasons to come out. :)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|No, this show isn't perfect but it draws us in week after week.  The writers don't feel the need to explain every single thing so some people will nitpick.  Just focus on the characters and the storyline, which are so engaging.  There are some characters we love to dislike (Andrea?!) but others feel like friends.<br /><br />This show is about more than zombies, though they are engagingly frightening.  How will good people adapt their humanity in a zombie apocalypse?  Is there a new definition of &#34;good&#34; or &#34;doing the right thing&#34; now?
034580404X|4.0|I dont care for this series, but my daughter loves it.<br />she is waiting for the movie to come out
B003QSMC18|5.0|I've always been a Beauty and the Beast lover but Princess Tiana and Prince Naveen have stolen the title of Best Disney Movie!!<br /><br />The storyline is positive, moving, and easy for even my 3-yr-old to follow. We rented this movie online and watched it FOUR times in two days.  I limit her screen time to 30 mins a day except for special occasions.  The weather was super gloomy and we were stuck inside for three days.  We watched several movies but this was, far and away, our favorite.<br /><br />Christmas will be bringing some Tiana dolls and toys to our house.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie for any child, boy or girl.<br /><br />There are some &#34;voodoo&#34; type songs.  We are devout Christ-followers and did not find it problematic.
B000IMUYJM|2.0|Black Christmas is a 1974 slasher film (widely regarded as the first slasher film). You may never have heard of this neglected horror film, and if so it is definitely worth a watch. This film was the first to take the stalker dynamic and update it for modern audiences. Many horror films such as Friday the 13th borrowed elements from this.<br /><br />While it is heralded for being the first slasher flick, the film suffers from pacing issues. Pacing in horror films is often slower to build suspense, but this film is particularly long-winded. The plot is simple enough, a bloodthirsty psycho invades a sorority house in Canada and hides in the attic, systematically killing its residents one by one. Meanwhile a series of obscene phone calls plague the house as well. The police get involved and by the end of the film it is realized that the calls are coming from inside the house. Great concept, not so good execution. It simply takes too long for things to happen. Most of the murders are implied but there is one scene where Margot Kidder's character, Barbara, is stabbed multiple times with a sharp piece of crystal glass that is rather effective.<br /><br />For its time it is a good film. It is a bit dated and if you've seen the best slasher films like Halloween and the original Friday the 13th, you may come away wanting more.
0439023491|3.0|The first of this series, The Hunger Games, was exceptionally well done.  The love storyline seems forced, almost like the author felt she had to throw it in there to appease her audience.<br /><br />This second book in the series continues but has a few dragg-y places.<br /><br />If you liked The Hunger Games, you will want to read this one as well.
B0045IZW9W|5.0|these guys are a crazy group with some crazy lyrics coming from some crazy sound. I've never heard anything like it before and I love seeing the looks on peoples faces when they hear them for the first time. Great group.
0439023513|4.0|great read, fast paced, not as good as the first one in the series but still engaging, I enjoyed the ending and thought it was satisfying.<br /><br />Having said that...<br /><br />Team Gale!!!
B000YHG72E|5.0|My kids have been watching this movie since it came out, and now even at 14 & 16yrs old, it's still a movie we enjoy watching as a family and having a laugh.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|This is one of my favorite Disney movies and, until Princess and the Frog, it was my absolute favorite.  The colors, the characters, the songs, and the storylines are incredible!
B009RI4FRU|2.0|Basic Boys meets girl moving, and Tween discovery in the 1960's. The depiction of the &#34;Khaki&#34; scouts, was funny and and a hazy romanticized reflection of the BSA at it's high point.<br /><br />Unfortunately Bill Murray's character along with Bruce Willis'  where very one dimensional and uninspiring. While these actor can absolutely pull off dead-pan roles, it just didn't see to work in this film.<br /><br />The films tempo build a sense of anticipation, vaguely like a clockwork orange, but never pays out.
B001706I5I|3.0|Jim Carrey is not my favorite actor but my daughter and husband really enjoyed this movie.  My daughter was riveted to the screen b/c she knows the storyline from the book.<br /><br />There are a ton of changes but it is essentially the same.  The Grinch is mean, gross, and overacts.  Sigh.  But the secondary characters are great and the costumes and settings are just magical.
B000001EHS|5.0|This is one of the best greatest hits albums ever... in my opinion.  Want some music to take you back a few years?  Just listen to this one over and over.
B004QKNXIQ|3.0|Though I suppose she isn't really adoptive, the Mother Gothel character is emotionally abusive and disturbing.  We have some friends adopting a daughter and she will not allow her daughters, biological or adoptive, to watch this. I agree.<br /><br />The storyline is too convoluted and my three year old did not enjoy this movie.  The chameleon character is cute and well-written, very child-friendly.<br /><br />If you have nothing better to do, I guess you can rent this.  Meh.
B000M5NRLC|3.0|Probably a little harsh, but this movie was not as entertaining as I remember it to be.  The video quality wasn't very good either.  Oh well...
B00AA7O22U|1.0|Once again the good ol boy club found a way for everyone with nothing to do during the week to show up and get a paycheck and screen time with little or no effort required.  What a waste of computer generated effects. Chuck Norris was the only one who showed up ready to work and earn his pay it seemed.  Lots of loud noises and scenery destruction do not a movie make!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I like it a lot except it always defaults to the town I was in when I downloaded it and that is not the town where I live so I always have to change the location.  Other than that, I like it because of the detail and the accuracy of the information provided.
B002C4YYEU|4.0|If you never saw this movie you should.  It is very different not your usual story.  It gives you something to think sbout.  It is not a kids movie you need to be an adult to take it in.  I just bought it for a family member.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Does everything I need and then some. Very easy to use and customize. I really like the different options on how to shut it Dow, you actually have to wake up to turn it off
B0056BU3I2|5.0|Fast five EXTENDED EDITION in blue-ray plus the DVD … I never get tired of watching this kind of movies … totally recommended!!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|This is one of the best series I have seen in years.  Cannot wait for the next season to start.
141659521X|5.0|I have read the entire Mitch Rapp series (not all would get 5 stars)--it must be said, that Vince Flynn has developed a formula--if you have read the books, you understand what I am saying. It is, to a point predictable (weenie State Department etc, etc) but it is just that he does it SO WELL. There are all types of weenies in the government who ignore all evidence to the contrary, that there are people that want to destroy this country--one only need read the paper. It is that reality that makes this a most enjoyable book--I raced through it, and savored it all at the same time.
0307951529|4.0|I was put-off straight away by this book because the first 5 or 6 chapters are very similar in content to the 4-Hour Work Week.  The repetition went on too long and I almost stopped reading.  If you haven't read 4-Hour Workweek the content may be new to you and enjoyable. The author is enamored of the \\"live anywhere, make money on the internet\\" ethos of Ferriss.  However he does  not portray himself as a Nietzsche-esque Uberman (Ferriss) but more like a regular (unencumbered) single guy who likes to travel and has figured out a way to diversify his writing income by blogging and selling e-books online.<br /><br />In part 2 the author differentiates what he's up to from Ferriss and starts to offer more interesting content.<br /><br />The author has a strong bias towards intangible products (ebooks, software) that can be sold online.  In terms of marketing methods, it's pretty much direct response stuff.  I'm in favor of direct response as well, but the author's own experiences and biases color his portrayal of how it works.<br /><br />Basically the formula is this:<br /><br />> your specialized knowledge or skill,<br />> packaged as an easy-to-buy product or service,<br />> and promoted online via direct response methods<br /><br />= the low-cost startup.<br /><br />Of course there has to be demand (either geographical or on the web) and low or irrelevant competition.<br /><br />A business  that makes children's toys is portrayed as having a startup cost of $300.  As a skilled  artisan myself  I can tell you that starting a business making something like wooden toys  (profitably) with $300 is not that realistic unless you already have the machines to do the work efficiently.  Of course the individual may have been making dolls using sewn bodies and purchased heads and hands, but such things are labor-intensive compared to what they can generally be sold for, so the notion that such a startup is likely to get to the $50k/year level (the author's criteria, not mine)  without an awful lot of hard work or further investment in production capacity is a bit outlandish.<br /><br />This brings up another couple of issues in making a successful business:  the  role of owning of having control of specialized equipment in order to compete in competitive niches.  Guillebeau's breezy implication is you should just find something where nobody is competing, which is not as easy as he makes it out to be.  His recommended approach, like Ferriss's, seems to be to discover a niche and establish yourself in it before anybody else gets there... again, a little naive and largely a matter of great luck for  the would-be entrepreneur who doesn't have a lot of market research skill.ithout an awful lot of hard work or further investment in production capacity is a bit outlandish.<br /><br />This brings up another couple of issues in making a successful business:  the  role of owning of having control of specialized equipment in order to compete in competitive niches.

B00AHSMDQY|2.0|This movie was quite disappointing.  The plot was weak and it severely lacked cohesiveness and character development. Definitely a let down compared to the previous movies in the trilogy. I put it on par with the earlier batman movies which were boring and ridiculous. Additionally it was WAY too long.
B008JEJPSC|5.0|The film was only released in widescreen once before, and they had crammed both wide and pan and scan versions onto the same single-layer disc. Boo!<br /><br />This edition is great. I would have enjoyed more insight into the making of a film of this scale, but I'm just glad to finally have a widescreen hi-def version that's not spoiled by heavy compression.
B001O6W9QC|5.0|Very funny movie.  Goofy and definitely dont feel smarter for watching.  Laughed very hard though.  Character development is stellar and actors are all out of character.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was engulfed in this book from beginning to end. I'm looking forward to the third novel in the series.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|Star Wars, Star Trek, The Matrix (first film) and now Avatar.<br /><br />These names are among the classics of Sci Fi and will be remembered as long as there are people who watch movies on this planet.<br /><br />Avatar is an absolutely beautiful retelling of invading somebody else's homeland and attempting to take what they have by force.<br /><br />However, it does not work out well this time for the invaders.  Yay!!<br /><br />This movie stirred truly deep emotions in me and that's all I have to say about that.<br /><br />I do not buy very many movies on disc, but this is one I had to have because I will be watching it for the rest of my life.<br /><br />The three disc extended collector's edition is packaged beautifully and has many hours of additional entertainment in it.
B00846REIS|5.0|I love this series. I love Gideon Cross. I can't wait for the third book to come out next year.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|I like this movie for what it is:  a different take on the original Star Trek franchise.<br /><br />I have talked to several older people who just cannot get over the fact that they blew up Vulcan, but it was not supposed to be the same timeline.<br /><br />There is one guy I know who saw the movie in the theater and loved it, and then decided days later that he hated it because of the Vulcan demise.  Whatever....<br /><br />Some purists might not like this movie, but I believe that it deserves a place of honor in the Star Trek pantheon because it is ambitious, takes chances, and wins in the end.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|Amazing movie-the background story is basically star wars...with a Joss Whedon twist!  Summer Glau is pretty amazing in this movie-Firefly is just one of those shows you just can't believe wasn't given its due.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|This is a favorite at our house this time of year. It maybe a little scary for some little ones.
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Such a great movie! :) I should probably just go buy it so I can stop renting it! Watch it!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|It reads like historical fiction...very engaging and I am savoring it.<br />She brings people, long gone, back to the world of the living while allowing the reader to travel back in time.<br /> Doris Kerns Goodwin is a remarkable historian and writer.<br />Good purchase!
B004Y8Y26C|5.0|It is a great movie with a great soundtrack. It was super easy to download too and very reasonably priced.
B007FLHW3K|5.0|Love this light for safety and fun. Ride Wabash Trace trail had many people asking about it! Easy time install.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|Great movie!  Brought a clearer view of the history of this era and the personalities involved.  A very well done movie.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I couldn't put it down and really enjoyed this book.  I definitely recommend this especially if you like the show Walking Dead.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I have considered Ender's Game my favorite book since I was a kid. It never gets old. I really wish they'd make a movie of it! There's good enough graphics to pull it off now and it needs to be done!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome show!!!  I simply love this show and think it's the best on TV at the present time!  Can't wait for the rest of the season to start!
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|A lot of my friends read these books so I gave this one a go. I really wasn't amused by it. I hear that the books get better and better, but this is a pretty low starting point. Especially for ten dollars! This book is worth maybe $4.99. Drop the prices and I'll read more! It's a Kindle Edition for crying out loud!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Words from the Master story teller.  Though this was a combined writing effort, the story reads exactly like so many have come to count on when a new Tom Clancy novel comes out.
B009VB97EY|3.0|There should have been more dance scenes. But the ones that were in it was spectacular. But the story line needed a bigger boost.
B009HEMW4W|5.0|Enjoyed the movie, not always the case.  This is silly either you liked the movie or you did not, writing more does not change anything.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I have no idea why so many people were disappointed by Prometheus! The only problem with it was that it kept you wanting more. If they don't make a second one I will be highly disappointed but until then, this was worth my 5 stars.
B000YH6YG8|5.0|I just think this movie is badass. The Blu-ray quality of this movie is good on my tv. I would highly recommend it
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Honestly, I read this because it was mentioned so much in the Twilight Saga. It kept nagging at me until I read it and I am so glad I did. It's a classic for a reason. I haven't read a whole lot of books from past centuries, just enough to fully appreciate Wuthering Heights. Love love love it.
B00AMBH70S|1.0|Jeremy Renner is hot. There is good chemistry between the two co-stars but the plot sucks!<br /><br />Four more words required.
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I didn't have very high expectations when I rented it, but it was actually really entertaining. 5 star on the entertainment scale.
B004LX0D36|5.0|Excellent!!!  A must read! Wonderful, excellent, terrific!! Cannot say enough about how great a writer Jane Austen was. Only regret that she didn't live longer to write more books.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|real easy to use...and handy... thank you  would  recommend to anyone.  and it helps it is free  for any onel
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I do not  think I can say one thing bad about this game. it is so fun!worth the money! enjoy!
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|This is awesome and detailed.  I can't believe it was free. I'm addicted already. Playing the game is now a daily habit
B009O2XY12|5.0|this is great to keep the kids busy for hours and  out of everyones hair they love playing the game
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Enjoyed the movie. To escape into some fantasy. Storyline is similar to the fact that the hero always wins and that makes it feel good at the end. Enjoy the different characters although the girl's character or her skills didn't really come through that clear.
B007ADIRDM|5.0|girls wanted this as a x-mas present they will enjoy playing with it when they recieve it at x-mas time
B004LROUNG|5.0|Real life jumps out of this book. It is so easy to identify with the characters, you wish you were part of the story. I red through this book every minute I could, even where and when reading should not have been an option.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|I have to say this game is addicting for a dash game, the diffrent vehicles you can get are always fun and useful. I have spent hours playing this fun game. I suggest picking it up,with it being free you can't go wrong!
B000SEHJGQ|4.0|It`s a very good novel with a very distinctive style which makes the story much more interesting.<br />It also reflects the society at that time with realism and meaning.
0345803507|5.0|Haven't finished this 3rd one but these books do keep your attention. A little surpising with the bedroom graphics but you can't help yourself.  Will there be more? Hope so.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire HD,  No problems so far, use as a back up to my regular alarm.
B0007Q6PBK|5.0|A classic Met performance. &#34;Produced live at the Metropolitan Opera on 15 March 1977.&#34; Pavarotti, Scotto, Niska, Wixell, Plishka . . . Wonderful. Subtitles in several languages, too. The first PBS broadcast from the Met.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|I needed an app to bring all my google calendars to my kindle fire. This app handles that beautifully.  I highly recommend.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|If you like this series you will like this movie.  It is not as great as the first one, but it is still outstanding
B008KYOCA2|3.0|More complicated than I wanted.  Just needed something that will bring all my google calendars to my kindle fire.  This didn't work for me.
0345803485|4.0|After reading all three books it got a bit too much of the same old story.  Not written very well but a fast read not requiring much brain!
B004MYF4SS|4.0|The setting, the history of the principle character were compelling. A bit Scandinavian in atmosphere. The lyrical description of the landscape made me want to see Lewis. With a thick raincoat!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved this book. loved all three of these books.  Great story plot and full of surprises too.  Wish there where more to read.  Loved the characters and really miss them now that I've read all three.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|not much of a story. the movie just kind of ends. it felt like the producers were missing matt damon, so was i!
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|This advent calendar is so much fun.  The pieces are easy to put together and fun to do everyday.  Star Wars is a great advent calendar.
B001V7SME2|5.0|This is just an outstanding small film.  It portrays a unique twist on the classic vampire story. This is not a horror movie, but is more of a drama between the apparently 12-year old girl vampire, and a troubeld 12-year old boy next door. A very satisfying ending caps off this must see movie.
B009ZE27US|3.0|if u really want an app that will take up as much space an elephant in a shoebox. ok that ur choice. but I'm telling u, this is the dumbest app someone would even bother to purchase. I feel so dumb right now it ain't even funny. :'(
B007GCY8FS|4.0|For the most part, I enjoyed &#34;Wanted Man.&#34; It was classic Jack Reacher. Starting his adventure by being picked up as a hitchhiker was clever. The plot was usually easy to follow with the usual twists and turns from author Lee Child. It was difficult to really picture the explosive ending without an actual picture for reference, but I managed. For folks who like the Jack Reacher books, this one won't disappoint.
0761163808|3.0|Bought for grandchildren - ages 5 & 8, but feel language is too advanced for them to read for themselves. Parents will have to read to them, although they can read, but don't think they would comprehend meaning of most of the language.
B0076DELIG|4.0|It took me a bit to get into it, but as usual, Harry managed to get me involved and I thoroughly enjoyed the story.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I have read every novel that Tom Clancy has written and I have yet to be disappointed. His subject matter is always exciting and his characters believable. Threat Vector hits the mark in every way. It keeps you turning the page to see what the next surprise is going to be. I rue the day that there will be no new Tom Clancy novels!
B004SDSSFY|4.0|Have not used much yet, but from what I have used it I am excited. I was looking for a way to create word doc's on my Kindle Fire and this seems to do the trick
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can hardly wait for season 3. The acting and scenary are both spectacular. The costumes are also lovely. After watching this series I just want to sip tea all afternoon!
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Love this app, it has many, many, many games so you are not doing the same old thing over and over again. I am planning on replacing my Lumosity playing with this app.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I purchased this selection because of a special introductory offer for a kindle e-book AND whispersync. I can't verify anything about whispersync yet as I listened AND read it from my phone...however the story was a gripper. I couldn't put it down once I got into the characters...quite an interesting yet considered concept.  I enjoyed the story so much that I ordered the book version sent to my mother. Plus, I immediately downloaded the next two books in the series.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|Love, love, love, this movie. It is a great display of someone over comming obsticles that may get in the way (that is an understatement) Will Smith gets hit by a car and looses his shoe on break from work, and still goes back to work. Great show.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|Fun fun fun!<br />My son loves it<br />He can do eleven back flips and land it!<br />My kids compete with each other
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I just really enjoy that this show keeps moving forward unlike Sons of Anarchy that seems to be stuck in a rut with keeping all the major characters safe and alive this show is not afraid to push the envelope and kill off major characters that's what I like about it.
