B001C5ZR1E|5.0|The best copy of this album I have ever had.  Most always seemed a little dead, this one is hot!  Dead quiet background, very nice. Oddly, the vocals seem a little further back in the mix but, it doesn't detract from it in any way.  I would buy it again.
B003TJR2HS|5.0|So happy I found this. I did alot of research, and ended up choosing this product. Fits with my ivyskin wrangler case, I can now keep my iphone protected, and listen to music! It was shipped immediately.
B00536OCZA|5.0|The remastering done on this is fantastic.  A lot of recent remixes have the bass pumped up so much it distracts from the recording.  This one is fantastic.  The vinyl quality is very good, dead quiet where it needs to be.  I would buy it again.

0307949508|3.0|Lisbeth Salander is a wanted woman. Linked by evidence to the murder of two journalists, she's on the run from the police - but the authorities aren't the only ones. Unbeknownst to her, an old enemy has resurfaced after years in hiding - and he wants Salander dead. While certainly as interesting as its predecessor, The Girl Who Played With Fire showcases some pretty silly villains. One is an invincible giant incapable of feeling pain, another is a bitter, vindictive old man who's been horribly disfigured. This sort of cartoonish villains best belong in children's animated shows, not in serious crime fiction. Aside from that, fans will be pleased to learn more about Salander than the first book revealed.
B006SV2LWA|2.0|What a slow paced boring boring movie. It was like watching grass die from lack of water. i thought the idea had merrit to realistically portray a pandemic. But the director also forgot to entertain.
B0063GORYU|5.0|just play it once and your hook. I use to see my daughter play it and told that was to much thinking its not I love it its grate
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like the variety of games plus you have to play to unlock more games. They are fun games. You can sit and play for hours.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|So I beat the game, love it...but there is no zen garden.  And the mini games are different from pc.  My wife played as well and no zen garden.  Wtf?  I will play thru a secind time, but will be pissed if no zen garden.  Anyone else experience this?
0446677450|4.0|Awesome book! A lot of great ideas that I never even heard or thought of. My only issue is that in the book they repeat the same thing over and over and over again... Gets tiring... Also they keep saying how 'easy' everything is, when in reality its not.. Life is hard and depending on where youre at depends on when you can act on opportunities.. Yes some people went from broke to millions because they had the right opportunities, but please dont lie to everyone and say everyone has those opportunities. Its simply not true
B006O5YHUY|4.0|Great movie , but mothers dies because of no healthcare,banks are bad ,teacher have credit union they have now need for banks ,teacher to be fired ??? what a joke.  all of this in the first twenty minute. And still i loved this movie.
B0068TL23G|4.0|This is a fun game to play, the graphics are crisp and clear, and the settings let you disable sounds easily. Yay! But over 3 mb and no sd card option? NOOOOO.<br /><br />This game will get 5 stars when that's fixed. A simple exit button would be nice too. For now, uninstalled.
B0068TL23G|5.0|Very nice game. It works well on my SGS2.  Great time killer for all ages. Thanks to the dev for a simple yet complicated puzzle game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|There is no game better than this it teaches you how much thing coast to get the game.The most inportint part of the game is skill and practisce.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I just love my new pink kindle cover!!My friend Patti that told me she loved hers, so I bought the same one! (as it wasn't available in many colors!!)  It is just perfect!! I bought a small make up bag at walmart for 4 bucks to keep adapters/ usb corn/chargers/ and stylus pen in there ..so it all matches and it very handy!!  thanks~~ I would buy more covers.. if they would come out with other  funky prints etc...hint hint~~
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I really like the kindle fire the color and the ease of getting the books, If there were any thing I would change about it is the on and off switch I some time touch it and off it goes while I am reading.  Ups brought it the day Amazon said they would.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Really like this game...some of the games are a little dumb but overall a fun game...would recommend if asked about it
B005N0PJJO|5.0|This Book was good as the first one. OMG it it so Erotic, Funny, Sad, and it made me cry on some parts. Christian and Anastasia are just perfect for each other. Finished it in a 1 1/2 because that is how Wonderful it is. Now reading the 3rd one.
B0068TL23G|5.0|This game is great! Addictive challenging and elegant.I'd give it 5 stars if it installed on the sd card. But since it does not, I have to uninstall it. Too bad.
B005XQLBU4|3.0|Ok game. Too much of a time commitment to complete a game. Sometimes gets buggy and modules respond slowly or go too far.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like the games but its sometimes hard to play them due to slow reactions on the touch screen. I enjoy playing them but i would like to see a quicker reaction between the screen and the game pieces.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game is really fun to play. I can recommend to get it. I would get again but I already have it. Enjoy it. You won't regret it!
B00006DEF9|5.0|I purchased this video for my husband,after searching everywhere for it,for a Christmas present at the last minute. I was impressed that it was a special edition, the price and I actually was able to get it just before Christmas. He was very happy to receive it and has been enjoying it almost daily. Thanks for the enjoyable experience of ordering with you.
B0019N8P2W|4.0|First off, i really like Daria and i didnt think there would be anything that could make me not love this. I just got it in the mail today, so i havent gone through all the disks but as i was peeling off the cellophane the case cracked.  I was so devastated! i'd read other reviews in which people talk about their cases breaking but i sat back and thought \\" they must not be careful with their stuff, there's no way i'll ever break mine!\\" Wrong. it broke before i even got the damn plastic wrap off. the plastic is super thin and cheap which kind of hurts my feelings. there are better built cases at the dollar tree :[  next, the thing most people are talking about is of course the music changes. alot of people are saying that their letter telling them the music had been changed was located inside of the sealed jewel case, however mine was located on the back cover of the case, slipped in round of the case cover insert. It was clearly visible as soon as you look on the back of the case. it wasnt a rude letter either as other people made it out to be. It was just kinda funny and explained that there was no way i hell that they could get all of the licensing in order for ever music clip in all 5 seasons. -shrug-  now to the inside of the case!  The case is made of a thin, cheap, clear plastic that has 3 pages each that hold 2 disks. im not gonna lie the construction of the case was crappier than i ever imagined.  The disks themselves each have pics of daria characters on them.  there  is no insert inside of the case. no episode guide or anything, but i expected that.  The episodes themselves are still totally kick ass even without the original music and in most episodes you wont even really notice for a while, and once do start to notice, it's a little hard to care. the show is great no matter what theyve dubbed the scene transitions with.  none of the cons for buying this even come close to outweighing the pros.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|way fun when you are bored at work! a bunch of diff games to keep you entertained. pretty pretty fun.
B000KLRUJS|5.0|If any opera recording will be around for all time this is the one. Nilsson was the Elektra of the century, we are not likely to hear a voice like that again anytime soon. Solti is full attack mode throughout and never once holds back to orchasrta, nor does he have to because all the singers are up to their parts. On this point I disagree with most other reviewers, I think Marie Collier sounds great as Chrysothemis, her voice is big and full. Some say she sounds nervous, well, being in the situation that Chrysothemis is in wouldn't she be nervous? I think she is especially good in the Orest, Orest ist tot, she sounds so full of despair and utter helplessness. Solti was out to make this the Elektra recording of all time, would he have picked her for the part if he didn't think she was good enough and could hold up to Nilsson. was up to her standards? No, nor would Nilsson. Collier is good. Resnik is really one of the two all time great Klytamnestra's, her laughing is blood curdling. The other is Varnay in her later career. So, this is the Elektra to have, it will blow you away.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|Love this game.  Fun challenging difficultly increases which keeps you interested.  Arcade type classic gameplay.  Great since it was free but worth the .99.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|Perfect transaction, and excellent cover for my new Kindle Fire.  I would recommend this cover to anyone that owns a Kindle Fire.  It is very classy and looks like you are carrying a very expensive book.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|has all the versions I love &amp; easy to get the word! I read my Bible more than I ever have now because it's easier to understand &amp; to access.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Stay with me on this one. I originally purchased this CD because I fell in love with that haunting little number from the movie \\"Closer\\". I couldn't shake this song and bought the whole CD (this was before I joined the modern age and bought an Ipod and could have just downloaded the one song, \\"The Blower's Daughter\\").  I hated it when I had to buy a whole CD for one song.  What was the likelihood that lightning was going to strike twice and I'd like even one more song on the CD?  So I gave the whole CD a listen to a few times. Did I love every song?  No.  But I discovereed, \\"Delicate\\", \\"Volcano\\" and \\"Cannonball\\", songs that I have come to love that even surpassed my love of \\"The Blower's Daughter\\" and couldn't imagine my life without these songs.  Lightening struck 4 times here.  If not for the purchase of the CD, Damien Rice would never have even been on my radar and I wound up loving the other songs more than for the one I originally purchased it for.  Okay, you've hung in here long enough for the relationship between Amy Winehouse and Damien Rice.  Here is my answer:  I orginally bought Amy's CD for just one song too - \\"Rehab\\" and had long ago discovered other songs on the CD that surpassed my love for \\"Rehab\\".  So now Amy and Damien are in my club of \\"CDs purchased for one specific song and I wound up loving the other songs previously unknown to me even more\\".  Don't you love when this happens?
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|Good music, excellent musicinas, greta places, i like it very much. The Quality, the sound, the video and the perfomance is great
B0054JZC6E|3.0|fun games to waste some time. the controls are not always precise but the games are easy enough. it's mildly frustrating to have to earn so many points to unlock the later games, but points can add up quickly.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is enjoyable to play, especially when you want a quick game. Great because you have a lot of options to change the way it looks. Truly great to be able change the deck, background, and to choose the type of deal you recieve. However having a minimum of 20 words in order to rate the game is a bit much. Truly, how much can be said about solitaire?
B006C1DH92|5.0|This is a &quot;Top Shelf&quot; game! It's Loads of fun with interesting puzzle carving combos. It never gets old, it's always fresh. I can dig it!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this was a great game. it held me and my kids attention for a long time.  I recommend this to everyone I meet on the street
B005K17RU0|4.0|Have used this app at work on my computer for quite a while and it has never failed me. Very happy to see it as an app for the kindle fire
B004JK61K0|1.0|I think it consumes too much of what we have little in the Android world - battery. had to uninstall in 2 days.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have only used this app for basic games of solitaire, but have really enjoyed it so far, works really well!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are fun but can get anoying to need to buy so many of them with the a lot of fake money.
B0063GORYU|4.0|this app is really cool :) I'm sorta addicted to it... I have to admit! spider is a easy but yet hard game and I like it.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|One of my favorite holidays films of all times. Draws me back to my childhood years. I see the film every year in December. You need to add this film to your collection to enjoy for years to come.
B005HV6Y5W|2.0|[[ASIN:B005UKJX4E The Tree Of Life]]  After reading the favorable reviews, I might give this one another chance.  Normally I love films with symbolism, but this one was beyond or above my pay level.  I started to get irritated with the flashbacks and lack, for me, of cohesion.  The photography was beautiful, but to me Fellini's films captured a mood, symbolism, a story, and always left you thinking.  His film, Juliet of the Spirits, reminded me of The Tree of Life in some ways, but I loved Juliet of the Spirits.  I was frustrated with the tree.  The one stand out to me was Jessica Chastain's performance.  I had seen her in The Help and in Debt, and was amazed by her versatility.  Someday, she may be the next Meryl Streep.  Since so many people seemed to love this film, I'm going to give it one more try after reading their analyses.
B00637HXNG|5.0|Just got this as a USA exclusive thru a big box chain. I don't have a 3D blu-ray player and I can CONFIRM that this WILL play in a standard blu-ray player. I have an older model Insignia player with the most current firmware I could download and this disc plays as any standard blu disc available. I am guessing if you have a 3D model it will probably play either way depending on your individual players setting. Picture and sound (DTS and PCM)are both present as audio options as well as a 33 minute documentary. 2 hours of pure heavy metal bliss for everyone to enjoy!!
B004QK5N5W|5.0|This product works great.  Just hooked my ipad directly into the tv and it comes right up onto the screen. Great picture and sound.  I would recommend this product.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Just started playin this game &amp; so far so good. Definitely thought provoking. I like the seek &amp; find set up.
0451169514|4.0|and man was this book a monster to finish! But I enjoyed \\"It\\" as an entrance into the world of Stephen King, and I won't soon forget about it.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a wonderful, much-needed family movie.  I don't understand the PG-13 movie rating because there was nothing whatsoever objectional in the entire film.  My family loved every minute of it and I can only hope this company will continue to make these inspirational films available for a long time to come.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like the simple challenges where u can earn to open new games. love it. I like the mini games and the wide arrange of different games.
B001IBIHQ4|3.0|I watched The Pacific first, prior to \\"Band of Brothers\\". I found that this series jumped around and never really established a main character or unit. It seemed more at times that each episode was almost it's own movie, occasionally one or two of the episodes were tied together. Still with it's short comings, anything done by Spielberg & Hanks is worth veiwing and diplicts the horrid scenes from the Pacific front. Along with a few episodes about Medal of Honor winner John Bisone at Guadalcanal.
B005COO1X6|1.0|I know it's only $2.99 but it is not worth it!  I use to love Stephen King but he has become a very lazy writer.  His book always start out good, the middle is pretty good but the endings have become let downs.  This could have been a good story but it fell flat.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Not only did Steven Spielberg & Tom Hanks keep you on the edge of your seat constantly with action filled scenes. Starting with D-Day, the Allied invasion of Normandy,all the way to the discovery of Jewish concentration camps inside Germany. finally to the surrender of the Third Reich and VE-Day. With the mondern day testimony from the actual men from the 101st Airborne confirms it's historical accuracy. One episode directly ties to next and always leaves you yearnibg for more.
B000002GKT|5.0|\\"Stone Cold Fever\\" should be carved into the Mount Rushmore of rock as greatest chord riff of all time!  The reason current hard rock & heavy metal is so sterile, mathematical & mostly appeals to only men, is that it has no soul, no R&B, no blues, no jazz, no funk. Those elements/spices make Humble Pie so much richer in their bludgeoning sound. Anyone who thinks Black Crowes/Chris Robinson invented their own sound, need to study this (& The Faces).  I love Zep, Cream & Hendrix too, but it's amazing that this stands up to any of their stuff for energy, inventiveness & zeal. I heard this initially in the late '70's & it was already a mythical historical document, handed-down by older brothers & played on late night FM radio. Frampton's soloing is great, but it's amazing how good it sounds when the 2 guitars lock into harmonies on a monster riff. If you like the Mick Taylor/Keith Richards guitar synergy, then you'll love Marriott & Frampton going at it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like all the different games its never boring. its alsocool because you can still play the games even after you beat them and still get points.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|This review contains spoilers so please read with caution.  Okay. I'm not gonna lie. I've been a fan of Marissa Meyer's stories for years now, when she was writing under another name (and no, not gonna say which name because it isn't relevant to this review, but some of you probably know who I'm talking about, anyway). So I picked up this book fully expecting it to be an enjoyable read, and I wasn't disappointed.  Her plot was fun, the blend of humor and drama skillfully done. I loved Kai and Cinder, and Iko was a riot (I truly hope she'll be making a reappearance in book 2). The \\"wicked stepmother/stepsisters\\" were very human to me. So was Cinder, for that matter. There were even a few moments when she wasn't that likeable, definitely not the \\"fairytale princess\\" type of girl. I think that's probably when she was the most human. Same with Kai, especially when discovering Cinder's secret and showing some very human prejudice against it. It wasn't romantic, but it was very real, and I like that.  Okay, here come the real spoilers, read at your own risk.  S  P  O  I  L  E  R  S  Now, I will admit, plotwise, there was a bit of overdone drama. It was also fairly predictable. Cinder coming to her sister with a cure only moments before she passed away, while great for dramatic tension, did feel a bit too contrived. And while the plot was enjoyable, Cinder being the missing moon princess was no big surprise. I saw that one coming from the get-go. Probably most readers did. Traces of the princess's flesh in the ashes ... Cinder's missing limbs ... put one and two together and, well, yeah. These two things are what made me knock off a star. Otherwise it'd have been the full five.  That being said, it didn't make reading Cinder any less a pleasure. This is only the first book, and the plot is only now really taking off. I am eagerly awaiting the release of book two, and find out where Cinder's adventures will lead her. Personally, I'm kinda hoping it's back into the arms of Prince Kai. She never did get her kiss.  ^_~
B001CTDH76|4.0|This series is amusing, deeply false and artificial, but original and paradoxically containing human truths, so the rest doesn't matter.  We see: \\"The Mentalist\\" is a false medium that at first works as an artist. Later it happens the tragedy of the crimes of \\"Red John\\" but that I think doesn't matters  anybody: it's only another more of these infinite serial killers it seems the USA is plenty today and an excuse to introduce Patrick Jane in the world of the police.  There, it's curious, as is evident sex roles are changed: beautiful chief Teresa Lisbon behaves as a man, she's externally hard, uses violence and carries a gun. Instead, Patrick Jane is soft and polite, but this is the case he ever ends in mocking from Teresa. I don't know if The Mentalist has paranormal powers, but he's extravagant,  falsely weak and clever and also deeply amoral, as I think at bottom, police actions and human justice simply are themes that truly doesn't matter to him. He's only obsessed with the capture of Red John, or mostly, with killing him as pure vengeance out of justice.  But between all this plot, there are  characters and situations unusual in other telefilms, deeply human and I think real, generally played by secondary people. Excellent and original series plenty of humor.
0307959856|4.0|Very fun take on the Austen characters. I loved pd James talke on them and it was lovely lo visit pemberley again
B000001GQC|3.0|I commend Claudio Abbado and the LSO for their passionate commitment and authority in this music. Abbado was a fantastic Prokofiev conductor in times past. The Scythian Suite jumps right out at you with a full frontal assault. It's brutal, not played for refinement as some do. The Lieutenant Kije music is less successful but not by much. And the big show on this disc, the Alexander Nevsky, receives a phenomenal performance that puts it near the top of all time. I won't go into details about the chorus, they are not Russian obviously. I'm Russian myself and this chorus makes so sense, phonetically they are a mess. Beyond the language differences, they sing with fervour.  The orchestral work by the LSO gets all the raves from me. The vividness of the Battle on the Ice has not been surpassed. Every single movement is a knockout without any misses.  Ok, ok, now we get to the bad part. I hate DG's sound! I detest it! I've tried and tried to warm up to it since the performances are so good. I can't deal with it and I sold this CD away. Why is the sound so rotten? I mean, yes DG has some bad sound work in their closet from the mid 1970s to the mid 1980s. Among them are Kleiber's Beethoven 5 and 7, Brahms 4, several early digital horrors from Karajan and for me the worst of them all is this Abbado recording.  The sound is constricted, it doesn't have depth or any transparency or atmosphere in the quiet moments. The loud parts have great impact but they are overly brilliant. I can deal with the over brightness but not with the lack of atmosphere. Listen for example the romance movement of Lieutenant Kije under Abbado and then listen to it under Fritz Reiner on RCA Living Stereo. The difference is night and day! Reiner's version has all transparency and atmosphere the music craves. It's a deliciously charming and poetic scene. You can see the influence Prokofiev had on Basil Poledouris' score for Conan The Barbarian. Abbado's version is so flat, so dull, like it was recordedin a cardboard box! Where is the air around the sound? Where is the instrumental detail?  Compare Abbado's Scythian Suite with Gergiev's on Philips. I think Abbado pulls off a more intense performance but the Gergiev strangely has more impact and it's all on account of the sound. You can give a listen to Gergiev's Alexander Nevsky as well. It sounds so far richer and more natural plus Gergiev has a real Russian chorus for added authenticity. The most striking difference is once again in the quiet movements. The great Field of the Dead lament is truly poignant and dark with a full atmospheric setting from Gergiev. Abbado can't do much when his engineers have tin ears, there is no sense of occasion.  I really do like these performances but I've always hated the sound quality on this CD and when I have stunning recordings by Gergiev and Reiner on my shelf, what's the point of keeping Abbado around to collect dust? None whatsoever.
B005TBQS0Q|5.0|It has been some time since I watched 1987's Good Morning, Vietnam, so while a lot of it was so memorable I recognized it immediately, some things were a bit of a revelation, especially as a metaphor for today's American military presence in the Middle East.<br /><br />Sure, you can make the obvious case for this to be a Hollywood anti-war movie, pure and simple, and it is at first glance. Surely making its points with individuals rather than troops is a powerful way to illustrate the effect of war on people rather than faceless masses. But Good Morning Vietnam is also a story about a relentless clash between front line creative powderkegs and front office administrators. It's also about how creative work reaches out to a lot of people that you may never meet, but to whom your work makes a difference, however big or small.<br /><br />More than anything, the movie is a perfect vehicle for Robin Williams, whose now-iconic stream-of-consciousness comedy is given full throttle as he goes on the air in a highly fictionalized portrayal of radio personality Adrian Cronauer. Taken out of the context of the late 20th century, when Williams was still breaking into movies and out of his \\"Mork\\" image, this performance takes on a greater depth than ever. He may appear to basically be playing himself, or at least his persona, but there's a whole lot more to it than just riffing when the cameras roll. As a matter of fact, if you watch the \\"monologues\\" presented in the bonus features (which are the same on this new Blu-ray as they were on the 2006 DVD edition, alas, with no commentary), you can see that he honed those routines over and over until they were as perfect as possible.<br /><br />It's no secret that this film does not tell the true story of Cronauer beyond his position of disc jockey in Vietnam and part time English teacher. What's also clear, especially watching it today, is that it also presents a view of 1965 through the prism of 1987 tastes and sensabilities.<br /><br />When William's character and an audience of Vitemanese viilagers sits in a dumpy, fan-cooled movie theatet to watch Beach Blanket Bingo, the complete irony is crystal clear as Frankie and Annette cavort in what is perhaps the penultimate beach movie. The movie seems out of place in that theater, but also in the pop culture context of 1987 and today. Actually, Beach Blanket Bingo was a new movie in 1965 and such goofy but popular films were huge hits, not the anamoly that it seems as presented in this context.<br /><br />Musically, it's the same way. The Beatles were a sensation, but they had only just become such over one year. Mainstream popular radio was playing Frank Sinatra and Dean Martin as well as The Supremes and the Beach Boys. In the accompanying documentary featurette, it is pointed out the Louis Armstrong's classic, \\"Wonderful World\\" (which became even more of a legendary song since the film's debut) was released after Good Morning Vietnam took place, but of course it served the story so well, it doesn't matter.<br /><br />And I'm not nit-picking for anachronisms. My point is that, in 1987 as in today, some are not aware that AM radio was so diverse. The film is peppered with putdowns of Percy Faith and Mantovani, but I'll bet the real Cronauer played Faith's \\"Theme from A Summer Place.\\" The sensabilities and realities of what made popular music of the mid-sixties was filtered through what became \\"classic rock\\" programming by the late eighties -- and what would sell on a soundtrack album.<br /><br />Robin Williams is superb and is given fantastic support by a truly great team of actors, particularly Forrest Whitaker, Bruno Kirby and Robert Wuhl. Even the small roles are memorable -- and the faces of the local people and the soldiers are especially indelible.ence of Vitemanese viilagers sits in a dumpy, fan-cooled movie theatet to watch Beach Blanket Bingo, the complete irony is crystal clear as Frankie and Annette cavort in what is perhaps the penultimate beach movie.

B000089CG8|5.0|Other reviewers have mentioned that listeners have been spoiled for choice on CD when it comes to this celebrated ballet. I nominate Ashkenazy for first choice among the complete scores. His main rivals are Previn with the LSO on EMI, Maazel with Cleveland on Decca and Gergiev with Kirov on Philips as well as live in concert with the LSO. All are very handsomely presented, beautifully played and the sound quality good across the board, especially with this Ashkenazy set which makes it a standout for me.  Decca gives it the kind of sumptuousness and impact that made this record company the premiere outfit for the early digital era and beyond. This Romeo was actually done closer to the end of the 1990s and therefore near the point of collapse for the famed Decca sound. All the big labels made huge cuts, massive layoffs and terminated the contracts of dozens of major conductors and performers at the time. Ashkenazy's Romeo and Juliet was lost in the fray and did not get a release for years, partly because Decca already had the famous Maazel Romeo with Cleveland in their catalogue since the 1970s.  I've never cared for Maazel's treatment of the score. For sure the Cleveland orchestra is a great instrument and scores over Ashkenazy's Royal Philharmonic, but Maazel's view lacks the splendor and romanticism of the music. He's all clarity and brilliance. Prokofiev's score calls for a lot of warmth and feeling from a conductor and Ashkenazy has that in spades. His scene on the balcony is just that much more involved while all the famous loud bits benefit from the bass and weight that the Decca engineers provided.  There are many outstanding collections of excerpts from this ballet as well, with the two most prominent being Salonen and Abbado, both with the heavy hitting Berlin Philharmonic. Both conductors let the orchestra speak for itself without much interpretative point making. Salonen is especially modern in that sense. A lot of people including myself enjoy sections ofthis ballet instead of the full wallow, so I would point listeners to those Berlin CDs. For the complete score, you can't do better than Ashkenazy on Decca. It's a sleeper, but possibly the best around.

B005I6EVUG|4.0|Love the case- it's stylish, well made, and it fits my kindle fire perfectly. (Don't know if it has been modified since earlier purchasers said it didn't fit- mine fits easily and snuggly.) I like the way it feels like you're holding a regular leather book when you use it- very comfortable. I love the color, I love the design, but...  Like other reviewers have said, it does have a strong smell or odor (which is why I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars) I had to take it out of our bedroom last night as it was keeping me up! If you are sensitive to smells, this might be a real problem. I looked online for advice on how to get rid of the smell- most advise putting it outside for a day or so (not possible right now as it is raining yet again) Or, to seal it in a plastic bag with crumpled newspaper and/or fabric softener sheets.  My mom used to stuff crumpled newspaper in shoes to keep them fresh smelling, so I'm going to try that option.  I also wonder if coffee might help? We put unused coffee grounds in our woodstove over the summer to get rid of the smoke smell, so that might work, too. Will post if any of these work.  UPDATE: I tried sealing it in plastic with newspapers & a fabric softener sheet, but there was no real difference in the smell.  I then cleaned the cover with some leather balm and set the cover outside for a few hours (we finally had a sunny day) and the odor has been greatly reduced.  I think it must be a chemical on the surface, because after wiping and buffing it with the leather balm, you could notice the difference. Hope this helps!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|there are many interesting fun and entertaining games to play on this app very fun and good game to buy
B0068TL23G|5.0|Fun yet challenging, has great replay value. Great for young and old. Definitely worth the price! One of the better games available. I'd take this over a tetris clone any day.

B004EPZ02A|4.0|I am a fan of the Paranormal Activity franchise and went to the theater opening weekend to see parts 1 and 2. I was excited about Part 3, but for some reason, not excited enough to go to the theater to see it.  We rented paranormal Activity 3 the day it came out on Redbox and I was excited to watch it. I like scary movies but don't like to watch them alone. My teenage children were home so it was a good time to get \\"scared\\".  This movie does a good job of explaining the origin of the \\"curse\\" and has some pretty scary parts in it. Overall, the actors do a good job. The younger Katie and Kristi actors are amazing, especially little Katie. She really makes her role believable.  Before this movie I never really thought about camera angles and how they affect a film. But after watching Paranormal Activity 3, I noticed just how much camera angles and movement can affect the viewer. Some scenes were very suspenseful simply due to the way the camera was positioned/moving.  There were a couple, ok a few...times when I screamed out loud or talked to the characters like they could actually her me. (Anyone else do that?)  I will say this...There are a couple of scenes in the movie where I thought to myself, \\"I cannot believe the just did that to the little girl\\"...Some scenes push the envelope, but not too far in my opinion.  Conclusion, this is a good movie and offers a few good scares with alot of suspense. But in my opinion, no sequel or prequel will ever outdo the original Paranormal Activity movie.
B001LNOOG6|3.0|Light reading? Tick. Enjoyable page turner? Tick.  Believable story? Not quite, but who needs it?  That's what fiction is all about.  I thoroughly enjoy Jeffrey Archer's novels, but this one caused me to question more than once the plausibility of his plot.  Danny, a young man who is thoroughly likeable and popular, is tried and convicted for a murder he didn't commit.  He goes to prison and there meets a man who helps him to improve himself.  I won't give away the plot by explaining how he escapes from prison (perhaps I shouldn't have said that much!), but he does and makes good in a big way.  Who really committed the murder of his best friend?  We know that right from the start, what we don't know and have to keep on reading to find out, is whether Danny will get his revenge on the perpetrators of the crime.

B0054JZC6E|3.0|very addicting and has an average gameplay...some games are boring and seem the same, which after 101 and some, its to be expected. but there are some real fun ones that keeps you interested. they even have a few that remind u of classics like battleship and snake.
B0011DK5AU|5.0|this album the third in their catalog is truly  afine example of a masterpiece of rock metal. it has stood the ravages of time and has become a prime example of how every other hard rock album should be edgy, melodic, a work of art. its far beyond its time,its far beyond my time for sure, fate was truly on our side when it brought these four guys together to create led zeppelin. its a shame that 4 members of this rock band are mortal. in my opinion, this album is to be cherished like afine diamond.

B005HXGE9G|5.0|For me, this is an incredible album.  I'm familiar with most of his solo work (although \\"Up\\" and his first 2 albums didn't resonate with me) and I am also a fan of powerful orchestral music.  (I have a very large movie soundtrack collection.)<br /><br />This music is VERY powerful.  Almost every song gave me goose bumps.  In fact, there are a few from this set which enthralled me even more than the originals.  (\\"Downside Up\\" for example.)<br /><br />The instrumental disc is just as wonderful and it's very interesting to hear the songs without vocals.  I would rank \\"San Jacinto (Instrumental)\\" right up with \\"Whisper of a Thrill\\" from the \\"Meet Joe Black\\" soundtrack.<br /><br />This CD set will not be for everyone, but it feels tailor-made for me.  I'll be listening to it for a long time.
B005LAIIRQ|3.0|First, let me ask you a question: How would you prefer to die? Plane crash? Suicide? Starvation? Diabetes? Freezing? Drowning? Bleeding to death? Falling? Attacked by a wolf? In this grim endurance test, you get to evaluate them all and pick a favorite. My companion can't vote, her eyes were covered too much of the time. When it's available on Amazon.com, I'll make her watch it!  We start with a North Slope oil-drilling team getting ready to go home for a much-needed break. They are rude, crude and lewd. It's clear from the get-go that the plane is going to have icing problems, so it's no surprise when they crash in the trackless wilderness where a relentless wolf pack sees the handful of survivors as intruders.  Let's talk about some of those survivors:    *Liam Neeson (\\"Taken\\") is a grieving widower with no will to live ...until he's about to die...THEN he kicks into gear and starts a titanic struggle to survive.    *Dermot Mulroney (\\"The Family Tree\\"), almost unrecognizable here, is a near-sighted engineer who is a steady influence when the going gets rough...but he IS afraid of heights.    *Frank Grillo (\\"Warrior\\") never hears a plan he likes. He argues about everything and challenges everyone. We suspect all that bombast conceals a cowardly yellow streak down his spine.    *James Badge Dale (\\"Rubicon\\") seems to be a sweetheart, always fair, always even-handed and certainly a trooper. He has a scene here that reminded me of \\"Sometimes a Great Notion,\\" please tell me if you, too, recognize it.  We have various personalities: the big-talking coward, the trash-talking wit, the taciturn Alpha male, the arguing contrarian, you know, all the stereotypes.... The script provides an interlude of humor as they relax around a campfire, but we mostly see dogged attempts to survive. The only outdoors training I ever had was with an Arizona Scout troop, but the city slickers who wrote this script made such laughable choices for their characters I wanted to shout at the screen, \\"Oh, come ON!\\"  A friend of mine said he really liked it, but after two hours of arduous struggle, I found myself leaning toward suicide...

(customer service is GREAT if you can find it..,seems hard to find. But when you do, they are good, fast and thorough.) Tonight on appstore on my computer it was indicating that it was compatible with Kindle Fire. I couldn't get it fast enough. If you listen to radio at all you will love this. I think especially if you listen to am or talk radio! You can access seemingly every station On the planet! Static free and all functions of a DVR. This app along with a few others make getting this Fire worth it for me.

1592537251|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo73HTQYX2GXVG]]Urban sketchers is a community of sketchers who share their sketches online. There are groups in various countries. I'm a follower of the main blog. I find it very interesting to be reading about places around the world, getting to know the streets through the eyes of people living or traveling there.<br /><br />This book is 320 pages thick. For the price, it's a terrific bargain. There are over 500 sketches featured from artists all around the globe. The styles are incredibly varied, ranging from pencil sketches to watercolour paintings. Each artist has a personal style, and each sketch has a story to tell. Some of the artists are so good they should publish their own books. Gerard Michel is one of them.<br /><br />There are three sections in the book. The first is the introduction on urban sketching. The second section showcases the different places drawn. That's the bulk of the book. And the third provides inspiration on where and what you can draw.<br /><br />The location drawings are accompanied by artist profiles and drawing tips. This isn't an instructional book so it doesn't really cover the techniques on drawing.<br /><br />I like the short stories on the sketches. Florian Afflerbach and his friends were drawing in Venice when the flood came and soak their feet. Nina Johansson documented the demolition of a public bath house, and the protest against the demolition.<br /><br />Artist Joao Catarino has a sentiment that I share: Drawing everywhere is like traveling all the time. Sketching is one way to get the holiday mood all the time. I can look back at my sketches and remember vividly the places visited. I cannot say the same for travel photos I've taken. The experience is richer when you're not looking but studying a place. I wish I had started sketching earlier.<br /><br />This is a fantastic book.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />(There are more pictures of the book on my blog. Just visit my Amazon profile for the link.))
B0063IH60K|4.0|Great app, really helps pass the time when sitting in a waiting room, or just to play because you're bored.
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Would have thought I got a defective one, but based on the other reviews, doesnt look like it... I tried plugging this into my nikon d5100, tascam dr40 and a guitar amp.  In the nikon, the audio was pretty bad.  Talking was audible but quiet, and the was a lot of static/humming.  Plugging into the tascam with just a 1/4in adapter, I couldn't get any level at all.  Literally didnt work.  Plugging into my guitar's amp, I could turn up the volume all the way, and barely get a level, though that was the cleanest sound of the three I tried.  I took it to Guitar Center because I figured I must have been doing something wrong for it to not work at all with the Tascam digital recorder, and after 20 minutes of tinkering, and trying different configurations of xlr converters and such, the professional confirmed that the unit wasnt working very well.  He was able to get minimal levels out of it -- nothing like it should have been.  This was all after confirming that the battery was in properly... so that wasnt the reason.  Im returning this, and sticking with the audio technica pro70 that the guy at Guitar Center recommended.  Sure, it was $130 instead of the $25 I spent on this, but sometimes it's worth spending a little extra to have the right tool for the job. lesson learned. the ATR-3350 is being returned as soon as I can get an RMA.

0140072187|5.0|I got this book the day I started flight school, and I can say that that author \\"enlightened\\" me on a few things to expect out of the training.  Some parts of it can be a little technical for anyone that doesn't have an aviation background, but the whole book reads excellent.  It doesn't romanticize war as many have done in the past, it gives the first hand accounts of what it was like to be a AIR Cav pilot in Vietnam in some of the worst years there.<br /><br />I can tell you that I, as a helicopter instructor have taken some of the tequnices mentioned in the book from when the author was in flight training, and incorporated them into my teaching style.<br /><br />All-in-all I must say that if you are even a little bit interested in helicopters and Vietnam history you will not be upset in the purchase of this book.

B003O86FMW|5.0|I just finished catching fire. it was great!i can't wait to read mockingjay. the end is a real cliffhanger. if you loved the hunger games, you will eat this book up! read this book!!!!!!!<br /><br />_satisfied reader
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have two daughters, age 8 (3rd grade) and 11 (5th grade).  This book is above my 8-year old's reading level and maybe just a little above my 11-year old's reading level, but it is certainly not too 'brutal' for either one of them.  Some moments are sad, some are thought provoking, but I think a lot of people underestimate what kids can handle.  I think a 6th or 7th grader interested in reading can probably read this story themselves.<br /><br />I read the 'The Hunger Games' and have been telling the kids a bit of the story every evening at bed time.  The first night I told them the history of the Regions and Capital, the background of the main characters, and how they were picked for the games.  When I was done my oldest said, 'wow that's a pretty good story'.  Last night (3rd night telling the story) we got to about 1/2 way through the games and they begged me to keep telling the story.  Some bedtme stories put them to sleep, but this one keeps them rivited - and they have been getting ready for bed very quickly so they can hear it.<br /><br />It's a great story, well-written (sometimes beautifully written), with memorable characters.  I highly recommend this book.<br /><br />***Spoilers***<br />My two bits of criticism:<br />-All of Katniss's kills were mercy kills or trying to save herself or someone else.  Her actions were almost exclusively 'good' and she was a bit one dimensional in that respect.  Her lying to Peeta about being in love was also done to save herself and him, so even that can be considered a 'justified' lie even if it was hurtful to him.<br />-The Capital held the hunger games to remind the Regions that they dominated by the Capital; so why does the Capital make decisions that pander to the audience?  Is the Capital in danger of rebellion by Capital citizens?  Perhapse the next two books will delve further into this apparent inconsistency.
B0029LHW68|4.0|I don't care that much about modern music an such, in fact I know very little about what's going on in the music market these days, but I do happen to know some fine new bands in the underground world. I have much more taste for bands from the 60's, 70's and 80's, that's what makes me tick, classic rock music. I liked more than anything when I was younger, I like today and I will always have that preference, no matter what! For me, nothing can top the classics.<br /><br />And don't get me wrong, when something from the modern music market pops up in my computer screen, I always try to give it a go, that's how I met such fine new acts, like Poets of the Fall, Phoenix Effect, Killers, and things like that. But again, the classics are just unbeatable!<br /><br />When I first heard that Jared Letto had a band, I thought, \\"what? That wretched little pimp from Requiem for a Dream? Well, it's probably nothing so special, and I will probably listen to it now and then go back to my Led Zeppelin CDs\\".<br /><br />But wait... that didn't happen that way. I still listen to my Led Zeppelin CDs more, but hey, now I have a new band to include in my list of a few fine new acts that I really enjoy!<br /><br />When I was redirected to the 30 Seconds to Mars website and watched the \\"Hurricane\\" video, it just blew me out of the water!<br /><br />Then I went across their album \\"This is War\\" and WOW!! It just blew me once again! It was really epic!<br /><br />My only complain about it is that I liked the video version of \\"Hurricane\\" better. You see, I enjoy progressive music, so I found very appealing this version like a big tour-de-force prog act with an interesting concept.<br /><br />But anyway, songs like \\"Night of the Hunter\\", \\"Kings and Queens\\", \\"This is War\\", \\"Closer to the Edge\\" and others also amazed me like no other act today!! Very U2 oriented sound, and boy, I love U2!<br /><br />I just couldn't stop to listen to this record over and over for a while, and when things like that happens to you, you know that you are listening to something special.<br /><br />\\"This is War\\" is a highly recommended album for all people who enjoys good epic pop rock music, no matter if you love more the classics or something new, this is just a fine addition to every music aficionado!War\\" is a highly recommended album for all people who enjoys good epic pop rock music, no matter if you love more the classics or something new, this is just a fine addition to every music aficionado!

B000FVE3AC|4.0|Great underrated diver's watch, and it comes with the latest & greatest automatic movement... the NH35A.... which allows hacking and manual winding -- making it everything you'd want in an automatic movement.  Construction and quality are excellent.<br /><br />One downside is that even though I have large wrists (over 8\\" circumference) this watch felt cumbersome to wear.  I think it was the thickness & weight more than the actual watch face size.  I have a Seiko \\"Frankenmonster\\" that is about the same size, but feels much less bulky on my wrist.
0316077046|5.0|We own all three of the books in this series.  They are a great read and my teens love them!
0142418471|3.0|I have to admit that I avoided reading Will Grayson, Will Grayson because of the hype that surrounds John Green. I've really never understood why he has such a following around him, and I couldn't be bothered to figure out, but when I purchased a copy of Will Grayson, Will Grayson, that basically sealed the deal that I had to find out.  The book wasn't that great. It wasn't even good, really, except for the end. God bless Tiny Cooper, because he was the only good part about the novel. Everything else was just blah blah blabity blah, and that's saying something. It's not that I didn't like each Will Grayson on their own. It's just that I found them more irksome than likable, and that's putting it nicely.  Also, I wanted to kill Maura, but not as much as I wanted to kill David Levithan's writing style. I get that the emo, depressed gay kid had to have some sort of uniqueness about him, but really, was it too much of a trouble to capitalise your I's? Really? Just because he's depressed doesn't mean that he has to have everything in lowercase, because I was honestly expecting him to start narrating in text speak. It was just annoying and that was the reason that it took me so disastrously long to read this book. If I hadn't had a free day to spend curled up with it, determined to finish it, there would have been no way that I would have finished Will Grayson, Will Grayson in under a year. Well...month.  As I was saying before, God Bless Tiny Cooper. He was honestly the only good part of the book, and the whole concept of Tiny was just genius. The ending was the best part and is the only reason I could be bothered to give this book a three star review, because had it not been for Tiny and the end of the book, this might have been a one star review, or it might not have even been reviewed because the book would have been a forever unfinished novel sitting on my bookshelf, collecting dust until it ended up at Goodwill or sold to the next willing customer on Amazon.  It's not that I hated the book as much as it was just such a stereotypical annoyance of untimely doom, and that's all I have to say on the matter.  God. Bless. Tiny. Cooper.
B001AFF25W|4.0|This was a short, motivating read.  A lot of the book is directed towards people working in an office, but as a stay-at-home mom, I was still able to apply a lot of it in my life.  The book's main point is based on a quote by Mark Twain which says that if you ate a live frog every morning, everything else you had to do for the day would be so easy.  It has helped me to write a list of the things that I need to get done each day, and then find the hardest, most important thing and get it done first thing.  Then, you don't have to feel guilty all day that you aren't doing what you really should have done, and it motivates you to be productive for the rest of the day.  I also like the point he makes that we will never get all caught up on the things that we need to get done.  We just need to focus in on the important things, and realize that some things we are going to have to let go.  The book seems to be well researched.  He pulls information from many different reliable self-help resources to create a well thought out book.

B005LAIIRQ|5.0|This movie takes place in Alaska, and was actually filmed in British Columbia. The main character is played by Liam Neeson, a hunter who is hired by an oil company he works for to protect the company's workers that are working on the pipeline from wild animals, specifically wolves. This movie revolves around a plane crash and the few survivors' attempt to reach safety under very treacherous conditions and under constant threat from the wilds.<br /><br />A word of caution - this movie is very violent!  I started out not liking this movie, but it gripped me and held my attention throughout the movie. Just a tip - if you decide to watch this movie, make sure you stay until the very end of the credits because otherwise you'll miss something.

0891349553|5.0|I fell in love with the book just flipping through it and wasn't the least bit disappointed when I really started reading it. Every step is explained and clearly shown in the photos. As a beginner, I was so relieved to find a book that gave me such a huge amount of invaluable information. The book goes through the simplest (and cheapest) techniques and tools for sculpting. The projects are adorable and easy to customize so they don't necessarily have to look exactly like what's in the book. I LOVE this book and will use it forever!
B003Y5H5AG|4.0|I found this movie on Netflix and decided to buy it to be able to share with other people. The graphics and digital enhancements are absolutely phenomenal. The most amazing detail that I saw through out this movie was the interaction between graphic and actor didn't seem out of place.

630529142X|4.0|Adam Sandler is an amazing actor who can convey many comical individuals. This movie is very hilarious but for a mature audience of course. There are certain portions in this film that are absolutely unimaginable, but they are funny. The farmer is the most hilarious character other than Adam Sandler's character.

B001AQO446|4.0|It is not easy to understand why Universal decided to issue a movie with plenty of musical segments and at the same time offer a legacy DTS soundtrack to it, with no options for a lossless format. I don't mean it sounds bad, or, granted, that this is an old sound source, but still, this is somewhta detrimental to the technical capabilities of the Blu-Ray format. Apart from that, the rest is fine, and an excellent chance to get the theatrical version back to disc.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I recently bought this case for my Kindle Fire. I am very satisfied with it. Here is a little bit about the case.  The outside is a hard microshell designed to protect the Kindle from drops. There is a flap that covers the screen when closed. It is held by an elastic cord. The stand does well as long as the weight from the Fire is on it and is on a fairly flat surface. The Kindle fits in tight enough that it is secure, but not so tight that it damages the Kindle. Touching the screen is a soft felt-like material that keeps the screen from getting scratched. Hope this review helps you in finding a cover for your Kindle Fire.

B004I8WD6E|5.0|I conducted hours upon hours of research to buy a case for my new iPhone S. Lots of reviews, lots of asking around, lots of comparisons. To me, the most important attributes of a case are (in order) 1) Ability to protect my iPhone, 2) Doesn't collect dust, 3) Not bulky, 4) Grippiness, 5) Works well with a screen protector 6) Appearance. I feel like the AmazonBasics case totally blew the rest out of the water. The reason I like this case so much is because it's hard enough that it doesn't stretch, but soft enough that it's not uncomfortable to handle all day. I trust it to COMPLETELY protect my phone in the event of an accidental drop. Though one of the complaints most people had about the case was it's appearance, I've received many compliments on the clear case because it's so unique! I've had the case for about a month now, and the only complaint I have is that the screen protector that comes with it gets fingerprints REALLY fast, and has an oiley-type sheen most of the time. Nothing a little shirt-wipe can't fix though. Gold stars for Amazon!
B000MCH5P4|1.0|The movie was awful and depressing with no redemption. I actually like melancholy movies but this was just depressing. Basically take ordinary situations in life and think of the worst thing that could happen and add it to the situation.  There is no reason to watch this movie unless you want to see an anti-western vibe of how the West mistreats those who are less fortunate.  The worst movie I have seen in a long time and a waste of my life.

B001HN6922|5.0|An excellent family movie. My family sat down and watched this one together. It was a lot better than the first Cars movie. Loved the action-packed scenes.
B0064MT1NU|3.0|I can say, hey, I loved this film and you will too and leave \\"my review\\" at that and collect my votes, but instead I will tell you what happens in this film (and, most likely, collect negative votes instead). This is what happens in this film: a piano owned by Holly Hunter's character is left on the beach when she arrives to be Sam Neill's wife. Why does Neill's character take much care with Holly Hunter and her daughter and her bags while totally ignoring the piano? Because the writer/director wants to show us that her mail order husband (Sam Neill) is not a caring person. He has dozens of men working for him, but leaves the piano on the beach in the surf because he can't be bothered, it seems. Neill then sells her piano to consecrate the idea the idea that he is unfeeling. Harvey Keitel's character realizes the importance of the piano to this woman and to manipulate her he trades his friend for this piano and then later offers to give it back to Holly Hunter for sexual favors (an offer which is accepted by her without words since she doesn't speak in this film, her only \\"voice\\" being the keys of her piano). During this we see Harvey Keitel graphically nude and Holly Hunter topless. Sam Neill, of course, gets jealous and resents \\"his wife\\" sleeping with his friend. Because the director/writer has not been successful in persuading the viewer that Sam Neill is such a brute of a man after 90 minutes of film she has Sam Neill, in retaliation for Hunter's adultery, attack Holly Hunter's character, graphically cutting off one of her fingers as she struggles to get out of the muck and mud of a swamp-like area. Thus it takes 90 minutes of this film to generate any sympathy for Holly Hunter's character. Add endless overcast skies (wonderfully filmed, however) and finally we see Holly Hunter's character basically choosing to go overboard from a canoe-like boat. When she does go into the water you may have more sympathy for her and be emphatically moved, or maybe not. Hunter's character herein is lifeless (some would argue that's the point of this film; nothing is said how she \\"lost\\" her first husband or why she has to travel around the world for a new man to take her), but because she is lifeless watching her sink in the ocean is rather anti-climatic. As I have said, if you have seen this film and liked this film my words ought not be especially relevant to you. But if you haven't and don't relish watching needlessly graphic nudity (which could easily been obscured, making no difference to the film)and needlessly graphic violence (the index finger being hacked off with a tree axe herein) then maybe this film is not for you.s character herein is lifeless (some would argue that's the point of this film; nothing is said how she \\"lost\\" her first husband or why she has to travel around the world for a new man to take her), but because she is lifeless watching her sink in the ocean is rather anti-climatic.

B005LCYR7Y|5.0|Some of Stephen King's recent work I've found annoying and nowhere near as good as his earlier work such as Christine, Pet Sematary etc. But in this deliciously large novel he's back in spades.  Time travel is always difficult to get right, but the 'obdurate past' King refers to frequently is acknowledged and dealt with throughout. Nothing is left to chance.  For non-Americans or those too young to remember the times, there's enough detail of the life and culture of the early 60s and late 50s to create the ambience - and the jarring changes back here in the 21st century.  The 'Butterfly Effect' is carefully adhered to - nothing which is changed in the past is allowed to go unpunished in the present. There are also the memorable touchstones of King's regular work, such as Derry and the inner life of young boys.  Great stuff for a good long read and a satisfying finish. Yum!

B0059XTTXC|4.0|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy comes to us with an impressive pedigree. Director Tomas Alfredson previously directed a critically, and publicly acclaimed vampire movie Let the Right One In, a foreign language movie, now remade as Let Me In starring Chloe Moretz. If you don't mind subtitles I highly recommend it, and the remake.<br /><br />Colin Firth won the Oscar last year. Gary Oldman, got nominated for an Oscar for this role. Mark Strong gave a great performance in The Guard, and Ciaran Hinds excels in playing spies, as in The Debt, and Munich.<br /><br />If you're like me you have neither read the book, nor seen the series starring Alec Guinness, so my experience of watching it fresh might be a good indicator.<br /><br />I probably would not have seen it if I did not accidentally meet someone in the movie business, who had seen Gary Oldman and the director do a presentation at their campus.<br /><br />When asked how he would like playing a stoic character, as opposed to his often passionate characters, he said he had waited thirty years to play a role like this, that often actors don't get to pick and choose their parts, but take what is offered and to put food on the table, and hope one day...<br /><br />As the movie begins, we become aware of a 'mole' at the circus, and an agent played by Mark Strong is sent to Hungary for a secret meeting to discover who it is. When complications arise retired agent, the stoic George Smiley played by Gary Oldman is brought out of unscheduled retirement to find the mole, the spy who despises his fellow spies. It's like a game of chess, with chess symbolism, where we read between the lines both of unfurling events, and Smiley's furrowed brows to gauge the churning depths beyond the stoic mask.<br /><br />He has a wife we never see, who cheats on him, and we anticipate a break in that stoic exterior, so as a study of character acting by Oldman this is a wonder to behold. In a way this movie sets out to be deliberately dull, somewhat the antithesis of the impression you get from a Bond movie, these men are bureaucrats, they ironically sing the Russian national anthem at office parties, not much seems to happen, they're not particularly interesting or handsome, with one or two exceptions, then the action livens up with an intrigue, betrayal and occasional murder.<br /><br />When the finger of suspicion points different ways, the 'circus' people suspected get very nervous, knowing full well what the outcome of that suspicion will be.<br /><br />As I sat very close to the screen, close enough to see the dots, I noticed the rather grainy footage like the detail of movies set in that era, the 70s. While I enjoyed it overall, this is definitely a more cerebral movie than say Bond, in fact it reminded me somewhat of The Good Shepherd, a movie I love, starring Matt Damon but which has gained mixed reviews. I think they were expecting The Bourne identity, instead of backroom antics at the CIA, the other circus.<br /><br />Several people around me left the movie early on, did not give it a chance, a yuppie sitting next to me, clearly on an early date, started immediately checking his iphone for other movie showings, was annoying, and thankfully they left shortly after to see a different movie. So this is not perhaps a date movie.<br /><br />I would say that I did not understand everything, some detail was lost I think in reducing this to a two hour movie. For instance, he gets a lighter from Magda,which seems important, who I assume was a woman but apparently was not. From an acting viewpoint, everybody gives a strong perofrmance, from a directing viewpoint, if you're like me you probably want more action, then it would not be what it is.<br /><br />I am now curious to check out the original with Alec Guinness. I think fans of Gary Oldman and/or Le Carre's original story will love it, and a varied response among other people. The movie also got nominated for an Oscar for best adapted screenplay.<br /><br />I hope this was helpful.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|I hate sports.  Honestly, I don't care for them at all.  I find them boring and pointless and lacking all excitement that so many heap upon them.  But, I love movies, and I love the Oscars, and when a film (and especially a performance) is talked up as Oscar potential then I feel the necessity to indulge, to take a bite, to `see for myself'.<br /><br />That is basically how `Moneyball' and I met.<br /><br />On paper, this sounds awful.  The trailers looked simple and boring and kind of dumb.  I remember making that comment on an Oscar forum, because there was just no way that this movie was going to be remotely interesting.  Then the reviews started pouring in and the praise started to mount and Pitt got his career best mentions and I sat back in bewilderment because all of this praise meant that I really needed to see this movie.  My best friend was happy, because he's always pestering me about accompanying him to sports related events (yeah, better luck next time) and so we went to the movies and I fully expected to hate this and wound up being completely absorbed in every frame.<br /><br />I have decided that if there is ever to be a movie made about my life, I want Aaron Sorkin to write the screenplay.  Seriously, between this and last year's epic `The Social Network', he is the master of spinning such detailed and rapturous webs out of seemingly mundane situations (baseball and facebook...seriously?).<br /><br />`Moneyball' tells the story of Oakland A's manager, Billy Beane' and his determination to make the A's a winning team.  The terms refers to the fact that wealthier teams get an unfair advantage in creating winning teams because they can outbid and thus buy better players.  Oakland was not a wealthy team, and yet by hiring a numbers man with a big idea (that no one believed in), Beane was able to turn things around and start something big for himself and his team.  Pitt is wonderful here, fleshing out a man who is very lived in and weathered.  He understands Beane and helps the audience to relate to him.  But, as great as Pitt (and the rest of the cast) is, this film really lives and breathes at the hands of the men behind the camera.  Sorkin and Zaillian build a marvelous script here, and Bennett Miller (should have won that Oscar back in 05) has such depth within his directorial work here that he illuminates every frame and draws you in.<br /><br />So, coming from a guy who wrote this off because of a genre, watch this...it truly is one of the best films of the year!ate to him.

True, I didn't get to see the incredibly talented Kristin and Idina (spool hope they come back for a ten year anniversary!!!), but it was still amazing!!! You have to be as horrible as Madame Morrible to hate this musical. From laughing at Popular to crying during Defying Gravity and For Good, I loved these songs. Now MY dream is to be a future G(a)linda Upland (of the upper uplands) and sing alongside Elphaba Thropp. (However, Im thirteen so this dream is a looooong way off.) This musical is truly amazing with such an intricate story that few can seem to master the emotion behind it. Oz and Broadway have been changed for good because of this musical.

0307352145|5.0|The author of \\"Quiet\\" is an admitted introvert. She did a wonderful job countering misconceptions about introversion. As a professed introvert myself I have always felt inadequate in school and work compared to my chatty and outgoing peers. Introverts are not people with a personality flaw. They are people who recharge their batteries by being alone while extroverts recharge theirs by sharing themselves with anyone who will listen. Introverts are thinkers, sensitive, serious, thoughtful, and reserved people. While they appear quiet and repelling, their minds are actually racing with creative ideas and planning their next exciting project rather than wasting time with idle small talk. Some of the most famous and renown people in history were introverts. \\"Use your natural powers---of persistence, concentration, insight, and sensitivity---to do work you love and work that matters. Solve problems, make art, think deeply. Figure out what you are meant to do to contribute to the world and make sure you contribute it.\\"
B003E6K1VK|5.0|This is a pretty basic functional review.  This is an external USB sound card.  Plug it into a Win 7 machine and it is recognized as THE sound card instantly.  It has two audio outputs so you can have 2 listeners.  It has 4 internal settings for the graphics equalzer which can increase the bass output if you want.  The first setting is equalizer off.  It charges while plugged into the USB.  It can be used from the battery with for instance the IPOD.  It will likely improve IPOD Gen 6 and 7 sound (given the downgrade of the sound chips on these devices compared to Gen 5 and earlier).  If you have a poor sound card and for example the [[ASIN:B000CMS0XU Audio Technica ATH-AD700 Open-air Dynamic Audiophile Headphones]] you'll need something equivalent to this card to drive the headphones.  Music is delivered to the card through the mini-USB connector or through the IPOD connector.  Pressing play on your PC player with this device plugged into the USB sends the sound to this card.

1400032717|4.0|This novel written by Mark Haddon, is the story of a young boy named Christopher John Francis Boone who has autism. Christopher has trouble relating to kids his age, and his dad never takes the time to be a real parent. Christopher finds his neighbor's dog dead and the police suspect Christopher of being responsible for the dog's death. Christopher takes it upon himself to solve the murder and starts to keep a journal with his experiences and discoveries. This novel is a great, easy read and would be highly recommended to young adults as well as adults. Haddon does a great job of taking you into Christopher's thought process and really helping he audience understand and relate to a child with autism. Although Christopher is can not effectively express his emotions or understand how others are feeling, the way that it is portrayed in the novel allows the audience to really invest their emotions in how Christopher is feeling and what is going on in reality. This is a must read and really captures the emotional journey of life through the eyes of a child with autism.

B006P0FD4W|5.0|This last installment completely did it for me. The sound was better. The acting was, too. There wasn't as much down time. And, the little girl and her relationship with Tobey gives the 'entity' more shape and gives us something to be afraid of, instead of just ghastly faces on the screen. (It seems there's something about children in horror movies that can 'turn up the scare.' Do we put ourselves in their situation?) The brief research done by Dennis gives us some background on what might be happening in the house.<br /><br />I thought the first was good. The second was disappointing. This one has to be my favorite.<br /><br />If you're going to watch this, do it right, i.e., by yourself and at night! If it didn't scare you, maybe it's because people were laughing at it around you in the theater. Also, I never saw the trailer and its extra scenes.
B001JV5B12|3.0|Plotting is slowly developed in and around the various action sequences; battles between vampires and lycans. As the story emerges, we learn that the story dates back 600 years to when the lycans guarded the vampires by day, until a betrayal gave the lycans the overall edge and started an era of distrust.<br /><br />Now, the life-eternal is a continual power struggle between the two groups, also within each group and occurring in an Underworld void of human beings. So, the plot is removed from the usual struggles for humans to end the threat. There are no humans, only hybrids; a perfect mating between vampire and werewolf. Scott Speedman plays such a hybrid.<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale plays a powerful vampire, almost queen-like. The mystery of her heritage is unlocked in Underworld Evolution, as she and Speedman team to end the treachery.<br /><br />The two discs represent good entertainment. Costumes and action sequences are very life-like.

But the song selection they chose seems to have been ramped up. More of the artists joined together to accompany each other which made it super. Sonny Landreth, Robert Randolph, ZZ Top, Derek Trucks & his wife Susan Tadeschi were outstanding. As well as great performances by Sheral Crow, Jeff Beck, Winwood, Clapton and the rest. The only one I didn't like was Citizen Cope. Even Clapton couldn't save him. The only blemish on a thoroughly enjoyable concert. Also, I hope the next Crossroads has Black Country Communion with Joe Bonamassa, Jason Bonham and the rest. It seems that nobody has ever heard of them. Down here in Atlanta, they don't get any airtime on the radio. Bonnamassa is a word of mouth artist and probably one of the best guitarist out there. I totally reccomend this DVD. If you like the other Crossroads Guitar Festivals, you'll really like this one.
B0068TL23G|3.0|Fun, but sometimes it congratulates me for finding the shortest path even though it isn't.  Check the sample photo in the kindle app store. It's easy to reduce the total length of violet and pink without touching the others.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|It is solid, easy fold back, lovely pink color and I feel my Fire is very protected. All the right cut outs for plug in items. I'm very glad I got it.<br /><br />Months later:  I love this cover.  It is holding up perfectly.  I like the elastic since so often I doze off reading, I have my hand through it and thus it doesn't fall on my face or on the floor.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|i love how i can share the word with fellow christians and friends and also follow a reading plan to get closer to God
B0068FYZZW|3.0|Bluray quality transfer not good...too bad because I thought this new release 25th Anniv would tighten it up from the latest one.  This is no different than watching a standard DVD....at least it comes with a digital copy but not a great bluray transfer....
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Very enjoyable, fast paced game.  Must keep your eyes on the screen and pay attention or missiles will get past your defenses.
B005LZW9CG|4.0|Anyone buying a gold edition remaster knows the record. I personally give the music 4 stars. The end of that.  The remaster is a different case. I loved the new Genesis remasters many people hated for the heavy compression. They should be very pleased with this one. Hugh Padgham's original master is certainly not overly compressed. The trouble is to hear the difference. Maybe I just don't hear what the true audiophiles do, I don't think it really does that much to enhance the original. However, even I hear something and prefer this new release the best we've heard yet. Check out the intro to \\"Do you know, do you care\\" and it's much more detailed than on vinyl or the CD before. In the end, this is the end of the road for me and I won't buy the upcoming \\"...but seriously\\" because simply isn't that much improvement on the actual flow of the music.
0525423281|5.0|I first read Anna and the French Kiss last year and I loved everything about it.  I had no clue that when I picked up Lola and the Boy Next Door that I would love it more.  The book is full of originality and emotion that makes your stomach do flips as you anticipate what will happen between these two incredibly talented teenagers.<br /><br />Lola Nolan lives with her two dads and a dog named Heavens to Betsey.  She has a punk boyfriend that's 5 years older than her and she has vowed never to wear the same outfit twice.  It's very rare to see Lola in what most people would consider casual clothes and without a funky colored wig on the top of her head.  I think part of me always wanted to be a Lola; just one of those girls that can pull of wearing polka dots and stripes at the same time.<br /><br />When Lola's old crush moves back in next door, feelings rush back to her and there's suddenly confusion in her life.  All summer Lola thought that Max was \\"the one\\", but no matter how much she tries to rationalize what she feels when she hangs out with Cricket, she feels a lot more for him than she wants to allow herself to.  I just wanted to say the Cricket has jumped to the top of my book crushes.  I really hated his name at first, but the more I read, the more it grew on me.  He's perfect in every way, it seems.  He's intelligent and so caring and he even dresses incredibly well for a teenage boy.<br /><br />Though you would think that Lola and Cricket are perfect for each other from the get-go, there are a few things standing in their way of being friends, let alone being more than that.  The first one is Max, Lola's boyfriend.  He's insanely jealous and his first intuition with dealing with anything is to deal with it in a rage.  The second problem is Calliope, Cricket's twin sister.  She's jealous as well, because she doesn't want anyone to take her best friend away from her, which she believes Lola is doing.  I didn't particularly like either of these characters.<br /><br />I love, love, love the way that Stephanie Perkins writes.  Every situation the characters go through feels so real and my heart swells with every sweet thing described.  The appearances of Anna and St. Clair throughout the story made me so happy, too!  Even though Lola and I were so incredibly different, I couldn't help but feel like I've been in her shoes.  Somehow, reading these sweet, fluffy romances really help boost my mood and I'm hoping that I'll love her next book, Isla and the Happily Ever After, just as much as these first two.Stephanie Perkins writes.

B005HSG3TC|4.0|This case is just what I was looking for.  It travels well and keeps my Kindle Fire safe.  The The strap is low tech, but works.  I could have spent more in a store, but this fits my Kindle and protects it well.  First review was in 2012, it is now 2015: The low tech strap is still in tact, and case has protected through my 5 year-old's toddler days, and a 2 year-old.  Do I want a new Kindle, yes, but the fire isn't broke, so I will not replace for awhile.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|as stated above fun but takes forever to unlock thing's some stuff sux on tablet a lot of different stuff to do
B005POK858|3.0|The game is fun when it works. It crashes my DROID X. I've tried playing it on the sd card and on the phone. Anytime the sound stops in the game its best to save before u do anything else otherwise u will be redoing everything u have saved. If u try adjusting the volume once the sound stops, that's when it will crash.
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|Whether you're a Twilight fan or not, every soundtrack they put out is incredible!  They have great music on each movie and I own all of the soundtracks!  There are singers/groups I've never heard of but end up loving and then buying their individual CDs - I've found some of my favorite groups off of Twilight soundtracks!  Even if you hate Twilight - you'll love this soundtrack and all of the others!!

Grey's Anatomy is a brilliant show and being able to have all the seasons on DVD and being able to watch them whenever you want or to catch up if you forget things that happened in past seasons - well, it's helpful!  Plus, there are special extra features that are neat to watch as well!
B0009FU0ZQ|3.0|John Updike famously said, \\"Ted Williams is the classic ballplayer of the game on a hot August weekday, before a small crowd, when the only thing at stake is the tissue-thin difference between a thing done well and a thing done ill.\\" That's how I feel about Jesse Stone, another Californian transplanted to New England. Ted Williams didn't pay much attention to fielding, but what he did pay attention to, he did very well. The \\"Jesse Stone\\" movies don't do everything well, but when it comes to producing character-driven, moody, exquisitely paced, hard-boiled entertainment, they do very well. One of my favorite aspects of \\"Stone Cold\\" is the Columbo-like cat and mouse between the serial killers and Jesse. Early on, we know who the killers are, but it is fascinating to see this small-town cop (\\"I mostly give out parking tickets.\\") match wits with the killers, who smugly revel in their intellectual background. Satisfying storytelling.
0756404738|5.0|First of all, I'd like to clarify that this is NOT a review. Why? Because nothing I (or anyone) could possibly write would do this book justice. In fact, when I read the synopsis of the first book (The Name of the Wind) it did not strike me as particularly worth my time. Luckily for me, I still bought it. Miraculously, the second book is just as good as the first, or even better.<br /><br />I could say that this book is \\"The Pillars of the Earth meets The Pricess Bride\\", but then my description would fall utterly short. So there you go.<br />(Don't worry, I don't expect you to rate this review as \\"Helpful\\", but you will thank me a thousand times over when you finally read this book).

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Real Steel is a Sci-Fi movie set in the near future where robots have replaced humans in the boxing ring.  A washed up boxer, Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) is trying to make a living on the road fighting and sponsoring his own robot.  Living on a shoestring, Charlie owes money to everyone he knows. He was a contender who had some great fights but he never got the chance to finish as robot boxing took over and became more popular with the people because it usually is a fight to the finish.<br /><br />Charlie winds up losing all of his money, his fighting robot is destroyed and he is desperate to stay in the game.  Charlie's ex-girlfriend that was raising his son dies unexpectedly and Charlie is now faced with trying to raise a son he doesn't even know.  He sees his son as a burden to have on the road.  Max, the son (Dakota Goyo) is just like his dad, stubborn, arrogant and smart.<br /><br />They are reluctantly teamed up to find a robot and tour the low end of the fighting circuit.  They assemble a robot from junk yard parts and pieces of Charlie's old robots and come up with a winner.  This movie is about a robot and a young boy seemingly becoming friends while a father and son get to know each other and bond together as family.<br /><br />This is a great movie with a lot of action and good fight scenes.  The special effects are outstanding as Steven Spielberg and Walt Disney movies usually are and the story line is outstanding.  Your family will enjoy this movie and there are some good one liners in the movie that will just crack you up!<br /><br />* Junk yard dog!<br />* The robot hailing from PARTS unknown!  Ha, Ha!<br /><br />You will laugh, cry and cheer during this movie as Atom the robot gets his title shot!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I am really enjoying this.  It comes in very handy for viewing and listening to my iTunes library on my Fire.  So far it has preformed admirably all over the house.  I'm very pleased with this app.
B0068TL23G|1.0|Update 4-26-2015:<br /><br />Sadly this good app has been updated and they added In App Purchasing to the game using Amazon InApp billing. They now sell you stars to purchase hints. As a result I have dropped my star rating from 5 stars to 1 star. Frankly I found the app to be too easy anyway. As a design engineer that laid out large electronic circuit boards my mind was just wired to play this game after years of doing similar work.<br /><br />This attempt to monetize the app is why I am very careful to update apps. I have seen many developers take good apps that became popular and add in items that would make me no longer purchase them. Unfortunately this app is now on that list. This is a bad move by the developers.<br /><br />===============================<br /><br />As a former design engineer this game looked all too familiar. I deigned about 1,000 circuit boards in my life and this game is identical to laying out a single sided PC board.<br /><br />You get to play through 9 chapters with 16 layouts per chapter. You connect the like colored dots without overlapping and using the shortest route. It is a simple puzzle but mind teasing at the same time as you may have to carefully plot your route several times to get each track into the right position.<br /><br />Earn as many points as you can as that is the key to unlock later chapters of the game. Have fun!<br /><br />Permissions:<br />* Full network access<br />* View network connections<br /><br />This app installed 3.80MB into my device memory and I am unable to move it to my SD card.

B0052UZIFA|3.0|Love this game but needs an update. Keeps not responding in between levels on my nexus. Maybe its an ICS issue.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun especially if you are looking for a game to waste time in the car, or anything like that. i just love this
1451627289|3.0|Overall this was a very interesting and good book. It is classic Stephen King all the way and his talents really shine. Still I was quite excited about this book as a history buff but it fell short of my expectations. The ending was interesting but looking back much of the stuff leading up to that end was simply filler. This book was 800 pages long and it could have easily been four or five hundred pages. How many times must Jake and Sadie \\"make love.\\" This love story became too much of a focus. It was nice to put it in there but it got to be too much. I've read plenty of Stephen King books and there are some which are justifiable by their length but his number one flaw as a  writer is to never want to end a book. The same was true of the Dark Tower series. Stephen King has the greatest imagination I know but he needs to wake up and realize that length does not always equal greatness.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Good Game :D Me &amp; my Friends play it all the time in School. haha (: its fun and addicting. keeps me busy when I'm bored. (: I recommend you download it. you wont regret it I promise.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|loved it. I try to stay away from extremely popular books for fear they're dummed down. the trilogy provided excellent imagery and pulled at my emotions. I am upset it's over - I should have saved the whole read for my upcoming vacation.
B0011Z7JRU|5.0|My first Led Zepp album. I had friends that had their earlier stuff, but when this came out in 75 I saved up the pennies to get it. To sum this up it is pure classic Zeppelin. Trampled Underfoot was the premier song on the radio air waves at first, but then came Kasmir which just took over everything, but to me the classic jam on this entire album is \\"In my time of Dying\\". Jimmy Page just redefined the lead guitar again. Probably the most unheard cut there is mainly because it is (11 mins) so most radio stations wouldn't play it. This is an album that maybe the best of the last great albums they did.
B0068TL23G|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and can develop some spatial reasoning skills even though it's \\"just a game.\\" Only gripes I have are the control buttons at the bottom are quite small so the right arrow is very close to the configure button, and I wish there was a way to modify your circuit lines without having the delete it one by one.

1908117230|3.0|I've been working on making \\"proper\\" macarons for awhile, and have been eagerly awaiting the English version of this book.  The book itself is beautiful and has amazing photographs and recipes ranging from traditional to way out there.  I've made a few batches of the basic, plain shells and the result is great IF you already know how to make an Italian Meringue.  I have made Italian Meringue many times, and know how to do so fairly well.  However, Herme's instructions for doing so make absolutely no sense.  I tried it anyway, with terrible results.  Luckily I had several \\"sets\\" of eggs liquifying in the fridge.  When I used my own method (which is well known and relatively simple, just Google) for making the Italian Meringue, the rest of the recipe was easy and produced awesome shells.  So, the ingredients are there, but the instructions for making the meringue are ridiculous.  Unless someone else's stand mixer and stove (and laws of physics) work differently than mine, I don't understand how this method could possibly work.  Anyway, I look forward to trying many of the different flavors and fillings.  But, you really need to have some baking experience to recognize the obvious errors and correct for them, or I imagine you would be very frustrated trying to follow the most basic shell recipe in this book.  Good luck!
B0034G4OZE|5.0|Yes, this movie is nothing like a mental ward (I've been in several) but it is funny and has a good message to it.  This was what I gave people for Christmas, right now its my favorite movie.

B0068TL23G|2.0|This might be ok for younger kids starting to develop logic skills, but this is boring for adults.  There are more than 16 stages, but it's just too easy to enjoy.

B001UV4XIS|4.0|This movie is a fitting end to this series. We had never watched any of the Harry Potter movies until we ran out of something to watch. Once we started this series we found that the movies were very good. The last movie was great and the movie didn't leave us hanging like some movies do. Great series.
B00005QCVT|5.0|This movie happens to be one of my favorite movies. I have heard others say that this is a depressing movie and not to watch it. But i do not agree with this. The movie simply have a lot of deep material but its worth it to watch it because it is simply brillant. As for the edited version, having seen the original unrated version, I can honestly say that there isnt much difference. The only difference is that two sex scenes were cut out. Everything else is the same. I absolutely loved this movie and watch it over and over. Anyone who chooses to watch this will not regret it.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Love this movie from start to finish. It is one of Woody Allen's best ever, from the plot to the choice of actors. The images of Paris alone are worth a peek.... you won't regret it!
0439023521|4.0|I imagine Katniss' character can easily be made to be annoying in the movie adaptation of Collins' novel because there are so many aspects and thoughts to the character that can't translate to film, but she is deeply intricate and makes you believe her disbelief of Peeta.  Collins carefully guides the reader through all of Katniss' emotions and you feel like you're with her.  I was thrown off by the story being told in the present tense, but quickly adjusted.  I'm looking forward to Catching Fire.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|The Ghost is Roman Polanski's take on Robert Harriss's screenplay based on Harris's novel.It's a tightly shot film which somehow rides on the coat-tails of Tony Blair's time as PM, at times very tenuously.The whole premise is based on Harriss's wry disenchantment with his former friend's toadying to George W Bush,through the involvement in the Iraq war.Why were they shoulder-to-shoulder?In the film Brosnan plays Adam Lang,who has become imprisoned on an island,Martha's Vineyard,as he's wanted for war crimes.Here,because he handed over terrorist suspects for torture by the CIA.Before this occurs, Ewan McGregor,becomes his new ghost-writer,following the suspicious death-by-drowning of Mike McArra,the former writer.McGregor(in an excellent role,naïve as well as cynical),has to reshape the ghosted memoirs left behind.As well as being well-plotted,the film has been beautifully shot in dour,grey cloud-filled skies and coastal,rain-swept scenery(filmed in Sylt,Germany).McGregor remains unnamed,Lang is out of power, both are ghosts,just as the iceberg in the novel is the illegality of the Iraq war.This is a brooding, moody, chilling, conspiracy thriller with a nod to Hitchcock of an innocent out of his depth,with the cleverly shot car chase and ferry scenes,where McGregor escapes the CIA- sponsored fate of his predecessor,like North by Northwest. Polanski has a track record now as a director of novels:Rosemary's Baby,Tess,Oliver Twist,The Pianist and now The Ghost where he is faithful to the novel.Oh but there's no good thinking this would have a ghost of a chance of  happening in reality!
0393338959|4.0|Freefall by Joseph E. Stiglitz<br />Review: Wms (Jack R. Williams)<br /><br />  Prof. Stiglitz has written an authoritative and insightful book on the causes of the Great Recession. His preface gets right to the heart of the matter by pointing fingers and naming names. A major cause was the appointment of Fed regulators such as Alan Greenspan that did not believe in regulation after being a disciple of Ayn Rand for years. He was appointed as Chairman of the Fed in 1987 and served there until 2006. He, as a non-believer, was appointed instead of the reappointment of Paul Volker, a believer in regulation and had a great track record. Bankers were a major cause by inventing new financial instruments, subprime mortgages and collateralized debt instruments. Bankers  and consumers effectively designed their own instruments where each essentially controlled his own leverage, equated to risk. New instruments were designed to deceive regulators. He concludes Wall Street did it to itself. The whole barrel was rotten rather then contaminated by one bad apple. The problem was systemic.<br /><br />  The author is dead on. His analysis is right to the point where we only recite the tip of the iceberg above. It is easy to see why the author holds his lofty position in the economic field.<br /><br />  This book must be read to understand the basis of the catastrophe. It is well written, simple and point on. I highly recommend it to all. Everyone should be informed at least to the level in this book.

081297381X|5.0|The Black Swan by Nassim Nicholas Taleb<br />Wms (Jack R. Williams) Review<br /><br />  This book defines a black swan as a highly improbable event. This is a far cry from a Gaussian or normal density bell curve defined in usual statistics. However, we often encounter bulges on the tails of the density curves showing the frequency of events that are highly unlikely. It is a wish of economists that the normal curve would define the likelihood of events, especially since the law of large numbers tend toward a normal density. And, with the normal density, only the first two central moments have values with the rest being zero. The math becomes relatively simple.<br /><br />  It is hoped that stock prices are independent from each other but we know they are not. The difference prevents accurate predictions from statistical moments. In fact, when black swans occur, stock prices become highly correlated so our attempts at diversification may fall apart. Then, with a catastrophic fall, all the prices fall similarly. For many theories or models, this can mean disaster.<br /><br />  This book develops the notion of black swans and warns us of the calamities that can follow. It is well-written, well developed and a pleasure to read. We may not be able to predict black swans but we can avoid falling into the trap that they don't exist. In fact, they occur much more often than we wish. For instance, 100-year floods seem to happen every few years.<br /><br />  This book is well worth reading. We may not be able to predict a Japanese tsunami with a `China syndrome' nuclear result but it reminds us that they can exist.

B00004OCQ2|5.0|Dusk is basically demos for what have been Badland's followup to the incredible Voodoo Highway album. What a treat that this album got released. Yes, it's not smooth and polished, but it's that rawness that makes it so great! Jake E. Lee gets an incredible cranked Marshall tone throughout. The tunes are a little less bluesy than the material on Voodoo Highway but definitely still groovin'. I would have loved to have seen how this would have become a full produced album. It absolutely rocks all the way through and am so appreciate they made it available to fans. Rest in piece, the late Ray Gillen.

Love stories, intertwined with vampires that walk the line between good and evil, are sure to make each episode memorable.  Great actors!  Great characters.  Great writing with imagination.  You will love the second season.

Would like to rate 5 stars but there is no app2sd and the touch controls could use some help. I suggest letting you draw the line and then having a button to &quot;lock-in&quot; the line after you draw it. I have ended up on a couple of levels where the last line a drew was wrong, and when that happens I have to go back and redo the whole level to get 5 stars on it. Overall, a really great game with few complaints&mdash;download it.
B00006AUIG|4.0|Wow! This was a very creepy film. Lots of disturbing scenes and a very creepy storyline. Highly recommended if you like creepy, atmospheric, and downright scary films. There's a lot of not-very-scary horror out there these days but this one is good.
B001F6TXME|5.0|This remote is a great product, after reading bad reviews of 3rd party remotes and their short cord length, I decided to purchase the Nikon brand to ensure quality and functionality with my D3100. The cord is not very long but but is longer than most 3rd parties and works well. This remote is also much smaller than I thought and is less bulk. Amazon shipped this to me using OnTrac, I have read many negative reviews regarding OnTrac but my package was delivered early in the morning on the date promised with two day shipping. However, the package was left on my door step without a knock or doorbell from driver.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|don't like the constant ads. sign up for this credit card to get this amount of points. I just want to enjoy the game not the ads.
B005K17RU0|5.0|works wonderful on my fire. never any problems with install or running app.  better than the weather channel app. thanks!!!!
B004UB9SKS|5.0|Travel Interpreter for the Kindle fire is just what I need for an upcoming trip to Spain. Not only does it provide translations of many useful phrases for tourists but it also has the phrases recorded with proper pronunciation and accent. I no longer have to mangle it because now a tap on the screen will play the phrase.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|I thought the movie was good. It was not great but good. I think the fact that I watched it on a large HD TV with a blu-ray player helped alot.  It was probably fun in the theater also. I could see it possibly not being as good on a regular TV with no surround sound. The Surround Sound helped tremendously. I am not going into the story as you can read plenty of other reviews for that. My wife and I am pretty picky and we both thought it was a good entertaining film. We found the fantasy other worldly scenes to be extremely entertaining and alot of fun. The bottom line is that I would recommend the film but don't expect an Iron man or Batman. Just take it for what it is...  A decently entertaining Superhero film. I give it 3.5 stars.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Just a tap away, current weather or 10 day forecast. As the title says, quick & easy with no overhead and then easy to dismiss. Very handy app.
0446585025|1.0|There are so many blank pages, so many badly conceived chapters, so many unfunny jokes and very little of substance in general. The most disappointing book I've ever read. One gets the feeling DeGeneres batted out any old thing to fulfil a contract.  I feel cheated.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|When I was really little some of my earliest memories were of my whole family, and sometimes our friends, gathering in front of the TV with some popcorn and Kool Aid to watch The Muppet Show.  I remember being four years old jostling around in the back seat of my dad's Ford Fiesta as he raced us down a bumpy road in order to get us home so we wouldn't miss the opening credits to a TV broadcast of The Muppet Movie.  Unlike the rest of America, we didn't have a VCR in 1984.   I remember being at Grandma's and my cousins introducing me to Fraggle Rock which I couldn't see at home because we didn't have cable.  Consequently it is only been in the last year or so that I finally saw that whole series.   Most of those  memories of the Muppets involve laughter and surprisingly-- my family.  As we got older, around the time I was eight or so, my sister and I didn't agree on much. She was the one who gave me the news on May 16th 1990. I remember crying until I thought my head would explode.   The Muppets films after that- which I didn't like at the time but I found grew on me when I gave them more of a fair shot-- were not quite the same. Okay, not Muppets from Space.  Let's forget that one.  I accepted you could do a good Muppets story without Jim Henson and Frank Oz.  What I worried about was what would the loss of Jerry Juhl mean for the Muppets?   I went to The Muppets expecting a middle grade Muppets film that my niece and nephew would probably enjoy more than I would.  Only there was an omen.  My brother in law had to race to get us to the theater on time.  I wobbled in my seat a few times.  When the movie started-- I felt the years evaporate and I became almost the same age as my nephew.  I enjoyed as much as they did.  Okay, I lied.  Probably more than they did.  I went home convinced I was a very manly muppet.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|super cool my lil sis likes this i wish it has more fun games every one. would have this app
B0063IH60K|4.0|Wish I could save my high scores. Other than that, the game plays great on my kindle fire and appears to be bug free.
B0063IH60K|5.0|nice large cards, and.the ads are family friendly enough that i can let my kids use it. Different options like deal one or three add more challenge options. We love the Winning Deal option. Do be aware that you can only get a wining deal while online, though.
B001974DG0|5.0|Out of all Dean's books, this tops the chart as my favorite, intelligent dogs, evil mutant, this book is a GREAT read!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this App. The access to all the versions of the Bible, the access to various devotionals and plans is awesome.  The only issue I have is that I can't access it when wifi is not available, like when I am in church.  I would love to be able to use it then.
B004P9GOAC|5.0|I bought this kit from another site, as the title suggests it's way overpriced by at least $50. It took me about 6 hours to assemble and the result is rewarding. Definitely not a kit for those who are new to Lego. I would price shop before you buy.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This app is the perfect weather app! It's easy to use and has all the information you need. I love the hour by hour feature and the severe weather notifications.
0525478817|5.0|I am an avid reader; and I don't like fiction very much. I especially don't like YA fiction, as a nineteen year old I find it overdramatic and riddled with touchy subjects that seem too farfetched for a teenage story. I was reluctant to read this book due to it's YA status, but I decided to anyways and if I didn't like it, I'd remember it fondly as another bad book in my long list.<br /><br />This book exceeded all of my expectations about YA fiction, romance novels, tragedy, and morality. I couldn't put it down; I read it in less than three days. I have never read something so profound in my life - and a YA novel about teenagers with cancer, for God's sake! The language and substance makes this book something other than a \\"tragic love story\\" - the semantics make it a rich moral conversation that you have with the characters as well as yourself.<br /><br />John Green manages to put some of life's greatest questions in the hands of two terminally ill teenagers, and they handle it with such grace and control that you admire them. Not for their condition as cancers kids who have to \\"be strong,\\" but for their superior intelligence and grasp on reality. You contemplate questions you've never even dreamed of.<br /><br />You will laugh at the biting wit of the terminally kids who joke about their illness. You will cry at the loss and the intense passion of the central love story. You will be left with two questions - why did the novel have to end, and how can I get everyone I know to read this book? Trust me, the latter is easy. The former, is one for intense critical evaluation. Perhaps another round of \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\" will do the trick.
B0030IG0C6|5.0|My 7 yr old daughter has been asking for a \\"real\\" unicorn toy.  Meaning one that looked realistic rather than the cutesy and more popular ones out there.  This figure is gorgeous.  It has the detail of a figure that looks like it was molded for porcelain, but it is made of a very hard and sturdy vinyl.  The floral vine painting on its back and the detail in the eyes is just gorgeous.  The added touch of delicate sparkles over the hair makes it appear magical.  My daughter is completely in love.  This toy is so special to her, that, to her sister's dismay, no one is allowed to touch it.  We got a similar pegasus to go with her and they are now \\"sisters\\".  I have nothing bad to say about this product as it lives up to our expectations.
075640407X|5.0|For certain one of the most entertaining and engrossing fantasy novels I have ever read (and re-read!).  This book had me at page one and still hasn't let me go.  Written primarily in first person, the character Kvothe spins a fresh and exciting tale of how he came to be the person he is.
B0053TMP24|5.0|this was one of the best books by rick riordan.  what i loved about this book was the fact that percy was in it!!!! i absolutly love the characters riordan made for this sereis!! if anyone questions if they should buy this book, just buy it and be happy you did!! this was a phenomenal book!!
B0068TL23G|5.0|I love these line puzzle games. This app is sleek and smooth. Luv the concept. It is a fun &amp; mentally stimulating game, but not stressful. Great FAOTD Amz. Ty Amz &amp; Dev Team. Highly Recommended
0689835604|4.0|My daughter, who is 2, completely loves this book and thoroughly enjoys the surprise of each page and finding the \\"hidden\\" body part.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game doesn't suck like a lot of ganes do.  its solitaire, nothing fancy.  but it works.  yay working game.  Hurrah.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|I saw this movie two years ago and it was life changing.<br />I went from a meat eater who only sort of thought organic food was a good idea.<br />To a firm believer that farm to fork was the way to go, and the only way to avoid some of the nastiness that gets into our meat.<br />Seeing the way animals are treated (more like a science experiment than a living breathing thing) will make you realize that McDonald's isn't necessarily doing you a favor by having a $1 menu.<br />The rate in which Americans are becoming unhealthy and overweight is astonishing, but Food Inc really puts it into perspective.<br />My favorite part of the movie is with Joel Salatin of Polyface Farms (in Virginia) and he is just the most intelligent and profound thinker.<br /><br />A great accompaniment to this is Omnivore's Dilemma by Michael Pollan.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game I think its a great way to pass time. Though some of the games are hard and annoying if you try long enough you can get them.I like having to unlock games it gives me something to look forward to.
0671449028|5.0|Sandra Boynton does not disappoint.<br /><br />The clever words and amusing illustrations are a perfect combination for a bed time story for your little ones.<br /><br />My 2 and 4 year old enjoy reading it several times a week.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|people say it does not work but it works fine.Great game but not the best.(the dragon is free) I recommend it
1592332803|5.0|This is hands down the best baking cookbook.<br /><br />No I don't mean the best vegan baking cookbook, I mean baking in all dietary forms.<br /><br />Colleen has beautiful and delicious recipes.<br /><br />Pictures that will make you drool.<br /><br />And tons of information about vegan substitutes and how to use them, when to use them, and where to find them.<br /><br />This is a great resource for anyone who enjoys a good dessert.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I think its an ok game. its fun to play but some games have bad controls. good if you want a goal to reach.
B0068TL23G|5.0|after the first few levels it seems so easy then it goes on and gives more of a challenge i really enjoy this one
B003L77GGU|5.0|This season was great, at first I thought the explanation for Sammy was a bit farfetched but they've done some great character development this season. I especially like the Weekend at Bobby's Episode. LOVE IT!!!! They've done such a great job with the dichotomy of Castiel which I think paralleled what Sam was going through. Awesome season!
B004FOA84A|4.0|It was super fun!  Ive always loved these types of games, its just a shame that the story ends so suddenly and was a quick play. Great graphics, cool music, and look forward to more games like this from this company... Yay!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I am glued to this game! It's very addicting! The challenge keeps me coming back for more every day.  I would recommend it to anyone even my 8 year old loves to play!
1451629184|4.0|This book was well written and just so hard to comprehend how this amazing 11yr. old when kidnapped handle her situation. I have very high respect for this amazing girl now woman and Mother. Great read! Really get the inside of how mind games have on people. Terrible, terrible man and woman who took her.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I did a lot of research on headsets before I decided to go with the x41's. I was having a HARD time with the price range for gaming headsets. I couldn't have made a better choice!  My problems were as follows: WiFi interference causing a popping sound, a hissing noise when I would watch a non-action related movie or when I was in the pause menu, and an echo when playing with other players(they would hear everything they said repeated).  The fixes: I moved my wireless router to another room = no more popping, at all. I FINALLY realized I had an optical-out for sound on my TV which I plugged into my optical-in on my receiver, no more hissing(only for those with newer TV's). And I had the talk-back cable plugged in upside down. The cable design is misleading. The Turtle Beach tree on the cable will end up being upside down when you have it plugged in correctly. There is a diagram on the back of the talk-back cable showing a headset and a controller so you know which end plugs in to what device. Now there is no echo for my party member's.  Additional notes: Using the optical-out means I can switch my TV from my PS3 to my Xbox 360 to my cable and I hear everything my TV puts out. If your TV has a USB port, then whenever you turn on your TV, your headset is ready for use. Last note, buy a 4 pack of AAA rechargeable batteries.  All in all, if you can make these adjustments then you will have a 5 star product hands down! I have killed so many guys trying to creep up on me, it's not even funny anymore. I can watch any movie with CRISP sound without any cords hanging and I won't disturb my girl when she's doing homework. Again, if you can control your surroundings, these are worth the price!  Always remember, you get what you pay for!
B003UD7JEO|5.0|I recommend this highly - a very good take on the genre. The name does not matter as there is enough here to let it stand on its own merits.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|OK, I got this because I needed something to protect my new gadget from my kids.  The number one appeal for me was the \\"thinness\\" of it.  some people call this cheap, but in reality the case has a very rigid back and edges, that are a bit rubbery and work well when you drop the item (I've found out).  This cover is \\"just right\\", in my opinion.  it's got just enough protection, and it's not too heavy.  If you want more protection without adding to the weight when you use it, then you need a sleeve, not a cover.  by the way, the raised edges provide extra grip when you're holding it one-handed, which I find I can do better with mine than with my wife's, which she keeps in a sleeve.  I'm not sure about the elastic band that is used to secure the flap, I never use it as the cover pretty much stays where I put it as I move around with it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wasn't sure about this app when I first received my Kindle Fire.  As it turned out it is perfect  because of all the different versions in one!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is the funnest. game i have every played. I'm 10 and this games are as fun as MW3.I play it all the time.
B003VANOFY|4.0|Overall quality is pretty good.  Fit and comfort I would rate at 5 stars, but the one drawback I have found is that when the battery is low and I have to plug it in, the cabling gets in my way.  I think the placement could be better.  When switching between headset and speakers, there is sometimes a lag between getting the volume switched.  Battery life is about 10 hours and the power save feature shuts the unit off after 15 minutes of no sound.  This unit was a replacement order.  The first headset I ordered from this supplier did not charge.  The replacement came quickly and was fine.
B004SBBDB2|3.0|I am using iphone4, IOS4.3.3. The cable sometimes can be used to direct Netflix to TV without problem, sometimes displays \\"not an apple compatible device\\" and can not be used.  Not sure what happened.
B0032KNA4I|5.0|New movie as told it would be. Have not watched so do not have any comments on quality of the disc. Will report back if problems.
B0068TL23G|3.0|It's an easy game to figure out and great time waster, but my only gripe is how you have to leave your finger on the screen. It can be difficult if your the type that wants to release and figure out your next move.  Neon colors would have made this a 5 star game for me.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app...I use it in church rather than taking in my actual Bible. I enjoy the various plans that are offered.
1451648537|5.0|Recently, I finished reading Walter Issacson's biography of Steve Jobs.  It is easily one of the best biographies I have ever read, since \\"Rise of Theodore Roosevelt\\" during my senior year in high school.  That is no faint praise, since I read a lot of biographies; as I tend to read the genre that I write in.  As Issacson's book was published mere weeks after Jobs's death in October 20111; it would seem like a sudden, almost opportunistic biography.  It is not.  It is quite serious and definitive.  The author's main source material is interviews from Jobs' contemporaries and Jobs himself.  One gets the sense that the participants know that they were being interviewed for history, without fear of consequence or reprisal.  This makes this biography surprisingly more balanced than most.  What the reader gets from the 655 page biography is the three dimensional portrait that all biographers strive for.  As the author notes, Jobs will be \\"placed in the pantheon right next to Edison and Ford.\\" {p.566} Steve Jobs is the creative genius of the late 20th and early 21st centuries, whose marketing skill was the simple, yet complex knowledge of what people needed or wanted --- before they did.  This was the quicksilver of his success and fame.  In reading the book, one cannot say that Steve Jobs was likable.  He considered himself special, often at the expense of the others around him.  His personality seemed merciless, a task master who demanded perfection.  But Jobs' leadership style also improved those around him --- by demanding their \\"A-game\\" and to be the best they could be.  A quotation in the book was particularly striking.  When speaking about her husband, Laurene Powell assesses: \\"Like many great men whose gifts are extraordinary, he's not extraordinary in every realm.  He doesn't have social graces, such as putting himself in other people's shoes, but he cares deeply about empowering humankind, the advancement of humankind, and putting the right tools in their hands.\\"  {pp. 543-544} While Jobs was the marketing genius of his generation; his personality seemed almost misanthropic.  The reader is treated to countless accounts of Jobs' bad and brutish behavior.  The ultimate spoiled brat.  In particular with geniuses in fact, they seem to have a lot of talent and ability in one area of their life and personality, and a noticeable absence in more common traits.  In conclusion, Issacson writes in a style that everyone can understand, without having to take out the thesaurus.  Communication in straight forward language.  Especially for those interested in the inside story of the dawn of a new age in technology, and an intimate look at its creator.
145551389X|4.0|LIked the book and all the pictures but it was a bit over prices. I bought another Gaga book that I thought that was much better and was cheaper and had wonderful pictures and alot of info that everyone wants to know about her. Its a nice book but the price is a little steep! But loved it anyway!
0670022411|5.0|This book is so good, fantastic debut for Deborah Harkness!  It's been called a Twilight series for adults, and that's a fair comparison.  I really liked the Twilight series, and this one looks to be similar but has more depth.  There are witches, vampires, daemons, and of course, humans, and the interactions and taboos between these groups give the book tension. I am counting the days until the second book of this trilogy is out, and I can't wait to see what Diana and Matthew will encounter in their timewalking.  I really couldn't put the book down. It's a fun story about the paranormal world for grownups.
0061719544|4.0|I have to admit that I never heard of Craig Ferguson until a few years ago.  Apparently he hosts a TV show for insomniacs, late-night revelers, and college slackers. Any way I picked up this audiobook and found it inspirational. Ferguson reads it himself, I should say he performs it.  Ferguson grew up in Glasgow, in a working class family.  He was a failure in school and as a computer hardware repair and maintenance apprentice. After leaving home and school at 16, he beame a drummer for a Sex Pistols wannabe band.  This lead to more drumming and some joke telling.  His real passion was the US, all those white teeth, suntans, astronauts, and gorgeous women.  Next thing he was in New York, where he was a big part of the drug and drinking scene in his downtown neighborhood.  What is remarkable in this story is how Ferguson re-invented himself.  After many failed marriages, absentee children, rejected TV and movie scripts, losing efforts in auditions, and hazy and hung-over nights and days, Ferguson started to realize some success with TV shows and weird Scottish comedic characters.  Despite his lack of much formal education, Ferguson writes well. At a particularly low point in his career progression, he wrote a novel, as that was the only art form he could think of that did not require managing other people's needs and desires.  For reasons that baffled everyone including Ferguson, he was named to host one of the late TV talk shows.  David Letterman owns the show so apparently it has some juice. I think if you are awake at that hour you need to get a girlfriend. So now Ferguson has written this book to tell us all that there is no reason to ever give up.  America is the land of many chances and second acts. Good things will happen if you give up the heroine and focus on work.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like some of the games, but ive only unlocked one so far. i like this app because eventhoigh you may lose, you still get the points. when you win the game you get bonus points. some of the games are boring, and some, such as darts, are fun.
B0050PYNP8|3.0|Two British nerds (who seem to be on their thirties) go to San Diego for the Comic-Con, apparently a very huge Comic Book convention. A running gag in the film is that everybody assumes incorrectly that these two are gays - though this is never stated, it is likely that these thirty-something losers are virgins. On their return trip, they decide to rent a huge van to visit sites in the US West related to UFO conspiracies (Area 51, Roswell). On the road, they find an actual alien, the Paul of the title, who is diminutive, grumpy and foulmouthed, among other things, and is on the run from some Man in Black types who has held him imprisoned in a secret base for decades. The three soon see themselves on the lam, not just from the US agents, but also from some rednecks and a Christian fundamentalist who believes they have kidnapped his grown one-eyed daughter. All this is funnier on paper than on film. The best part is the first fifteen minutes, with its pointed satire of Nerd culture. After that, the film loses steam.  This is the first film I have seen from the British comic duo of Simon Pegg and Nick Frost (they wrote the film and starred in it), and I must say that I wasn't too impressed with them. The movie never reaches its potential and is only intermittently funny. Also, I must say that for a semi mainstream movie, its mockery of Christian people is pretty pointed and harsh.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|beautiful music, and very soothing. it works great on my kindle fire. highly recommend as a relaxing alternative to the original quell game.
B0068TL23G|4.0|I got it as kindle fire free app of the day. good time waster, easy levels, but not worth the price. you should try it.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love these games! They are such great games! They're so good I just want to kill my self!!!!:D Ha ha ha ha!!!!....
B003L77GG0|5.0|When a local blockbuster was going out of business, I was able to buy seasons one through seven from them. I was addicted and could not stop watching the episodes. I soon afterward found season eight online and a little later, season nine as well. I was long awaiting the release of season ten to see how the writers would wrap up the amazing show. I was very pleasantly surprised. It was fantastic. It was definitely a great use of some of my Christmas money.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I really love this case, it has a lush and soft feel like a antique book. It is so nice to have a case that does not look like it belongs to a liitle kid,this case has a beautiful sophisticated appearence and is seams to be made quite well.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I ordered this cover for my Kindle Fire and love it.  It is very sharp looking (even my daughter in college thought it looked great)and makes it easy to carry my Fire with me everywhere, including the gym. The Fire is held in by 4 elastic bands that are very tight, so I have no worries about it coming loose.  The  exterior is not only great looking, but seems to be very durable.
B005HP2J66|4.0|I think Werner Herzog is as daring a documentarian as any, with a proven track record. The Chauvet Caves are certainly significant, inasmuch as there's not been anything that so clearly examines what life might've been like 32,000 years ago. Sure, it was repetitive, and Herzog's own soothing voice and clear diction as narrator is earnest in it's care and dedication to this project. He was specially allowed into the caves, with basic film equipment, and the fact that the 3-D was \\"manufactured\\" didn't matter to me, since I don't have 3-D capabilities. This is a worthy endeavor, and the various assertions by highly regarded scientists may sound like boring lectures, but the substance of those little lectures was compelling. Definitely worth a look.<br /><br />Being a musician, I was especially taken by the DVD extra, \\"Ode to the Dawn of Man\\", Herzog's mini-doc about composer Ernst Reijseger, which I found utterly fascinating. Indeed, his choral music for the background of the feature film is stunning.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This book is an extraordinary trip.  The main characters developed over the course of the book - zig zagging in time and place and viewpoint.  I fell a little bit in love with the Night Circus -- wishing I could get a ticket to visit.<br /><br />The structure of the book is complicated. It's best to trust the writer's narration. Just lie back and let the story take you.<br /><br />The writing is rich.  The scenes are vivid.  The characters are incredibly compelling.  The rules that apply to this game are revealed over time - a mystery that is lovely to unfold.<br /><br />Yes, this is the kind of novel that goes best with a good bottle of wine, a comfortable blanket, and fresh flowers near the bedside.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this app is tons of fun you will have an unlimited amount of games to play. my girls love playing all the new games that they unlock.
B005HSG3U6|4.0|Overall I've been pleased with the cover.  It was easy to install and fits neatly onto my Fire.  One complaint is that that back brace doesn't hold up well if you try to set it up on a flat surface.  I don't use it much that way since I pretty much have it in hand, but there are times when I'd like to use as a stand up screen.  Also, the flexible side of the cover isn't very thick, so for carrying purposes my partner made a simple padded bag into which it fits tightly, with one side marked with a 'T' so I know it's the top.
B003PIUC02|5.0|This review isn't focused on the series (which has been covered by plenty of others), but about the Extended Director's Cut Episodes exclusively on Blu-ray.  When I decided to Purchase Spartacus, I decided to purchase it on Blu-ray because the Blu-ray is the only release that includes the extended episodes. Four of the 13 episodes are extended, and they are episodes 1,2,6, and 8.  After seeing the extended episodes, I was a little disappointed at how much they were extended. Each of the episodes are only maybe a few seconds longer as far as I could tell (after watching the first and second episode, I didn't even notice where the extended scenes in those episodes were, and I have seen those episodes twice before.) The only episode that is noticeably different is episode 6, \\"Delicate Things\\", and the only thing that was really extended are the sex scenes (which was extended by 16 seconds total.)  So as far as I could tell, the only thing I noticed that was different was the length of the sex scenes in episode 6 (which were extended by 2 or 3 seconds here and there). I don't really care for the extended sex scenes, but it's really hard to tell the difference between the extended and the original anyways.  So basically, I think the only extended scenes are sex scenes which were too risque for television (even for this show).  But I love the show Spartacus, and would recommend the Blu-ray version to any adult fan of the series, because the quality in picture is unsurpassed. So as far as recommendations go, I recommend the bluray over the dvd because of the picture. I recommend this show to anyone who loves action and drama in a tv series.
0375846735|2.0|I really enjoyed the first two books of this series; they had strong central characters combined with interesting stories.  In trying to tie together the overall story, however, the author failed abysmally and created a disjointed, pointless jumble of words.  Avoid.
B00435WX7G|4.0|I love this model, it looks just like the one in the show!(and it really doesn't need any painting) The only area where it falls short is in \\"durability\\" because it feels like everything on the top of the ship (the sails and railing) could break very easily if your not very careful when handling it.  I actually broke part of the white railing when I was removing it from the tree.(luckily I had a bottle of superglue handy) A few tips before putting this together: Put the stickers on first(it will be much easier than doing it when it's put together and don't rush like I did and put the ship's figurehead (sheep) together before attaching it to the ship because it's really hard to take apart! The only thing I didn't like about this model was the flimsy hollow plastic base.  Other than those issues this is a must buy for any One Piece fan!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|My only complaint is that you can not see which pieces have been captured. Otherwise nice game, especially for free
0439023521|5.0|LOVED THIS BOOK. I kept hearing about it so of  course I had to buy it to see what all the talk was about. It was great. On to the next book..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is one of the best apps I have downloaded to date for free this game comes with so much to do but its also challenging at the same time you have to play hard but fun harder.

B002ZG9968|1.0|WEll yes Jennifer is adorable BUT don't be fooled by the \\"cute\\" modern subject of this movie or the title.  There are SO many WEIRD twists and rideculous, bizzare and DISTURBING sceenes it was just so GROSS at times- i can't believe she agreed to make this movie.  Now if you WANT to watch (first sceene) her being examined by her gynocologist - while he pulls a bloody instrument out of her -Then knock yourself out!  If you WANT to watch a woman having a baby in a kiddie pool while ALL her friends stand and watch and you get to see WAY more than you want to -- then have fun - the plot was WEIRD and made no sense and NO guy would fall for her like that - it was just ODD!!  I wouldn't waste my money on buying it - I was sorry I went to see it!  what a waste of my time and her talent!!
B004I8WD6E|2.0|I use a Gelaskins on the back of my phone and wanted to find a clear case so I could still display the skin.  It's hard to find a clear one so even with the design, thought I would give this one a try.  First time I've given a two star review - and if it weren't for the screen protector, it would be a one. The plastic is stiff and much thicker than it needs to be but most bothersome is the poorly finished edge around the back of the phone that digs into your hand.  I love Amazon and really wanted to like this product but it took it off after two hours.  I opted instead for the Black & White Premium Bumper Apple iPhone 4 case.  It's open to the back but very lightweight and protects the edges well while being comfortable in the hand - plus it's only $1.74!
B0068TL23G|4.0|Router is a winner in the easy going fun game category.  Enjoyable, Non-Stressful puzzle game where you get to be creative.  Not a super sophisticated app like A-Birds,etc. but definitely deserves 4 starrs and works as described.  Nice graphics, smooth operation, pleasant sounds and no glitches on my Xoom.  Well done...it's a keeper.  THANKS!
B0031RAOVY|4.0|OMGoodness!  I love dogs.  I have eight of them.  I cried like a little girl the last 30 minutes of this movie.  I wanted to stop watching, but I couldn't- hoping something good would happen.  My pack thought I had lost my mind as they were with me while I was watching.  I got plenty of kisses (they liked the salty tears apparently).  This was a good movie, but being the dog lover that I am.... I will never watch it again!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I think the Bible app for the kindle product needs a few improvements, but overall is a great, #1, app.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|Walter Isaacson gives us an inspirational story of the man who &#34;think&#34;-ed different&#34;-ly. This book covers everything from his early childhood to the Apple I to Macintosh to NeXT to his return to Apple in 1996 and to the iPod years. This book reigns supreme over all other Steve Jobs books on the Kindle store. One thing I disliked about this book, especially during the iMac years was mentioning products, such as the MacBook Pro, but never discussing when the product was released. However, besides this fact, this book is a must-buy and might cause you to &#34;think different&#34;-ly about Steve Jobs.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Purchased this item thinking I didn't  have much use for it. The price was so good I coulldn't resist buying it.  Now that i have it I use it when I use my macro lens.  It works easily with my Nikon 3100 and the connection fits perfectly.  Like all Nikon products it is high quality.

B00005JLR8|5.0|This beautiful sad story about a young Irish family, illegal immigrants in New York, is by a long shot the best film that I have watched this year, so far. It was made in 2004 and did collect some awards at the time.<br />Director Jim Sheridan wrote the story with his daughters: the family Sullivan in the film has lost a little son, Frankie, to a brain tumor. The film is dedicated to Frankie Sheridan. One assumes the writing comes from the heart and from experience. (I can relate to it.)<br /><br />The stars of the story are the two little daughters, real sisters in real life. The elder one serves as narrator from the off, but sparingly. The father is an actor out of work. He can't seem to act any more, is what his wife observes. He thinks it is because he has no feelings any more. The mother finds a job in an ice cream shop called Heaven. Father drives taxi and goes to endless auditions.<br />They befriend Mateo,  a neighbor in their junkie apartment house, a lonely black artist, who is suffering from some unspecified disease. Mateo will provide the link to the ET element of the story, which can be anticipated from the full moon above Manhattan.<br />Mateo also provides the miraculous happy end to the film.<br />Films with happy ends can still do heavy damage to your tissue stocks.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|Think Carole King crossed with Janis Joplin and you've got a handle on Adele's vocals. A truly beautiful voice that is leveraged perfectly with the songs on this album. Rolling in the Deep is one of those rare songs that I loved the first time I heard it and Set Fire to the Rain isn't far behind. If you like good lyrics sung by a beautiful, smoky voice, you'll love this album.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|This case is awesome. Not too bulky but still offers good protection. The case also acts as a stand which is helpful as well. This is priced excellently and works great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think that this game is lots of fun and you get to have a a lot of different choices of what games you want to play because there really is like 100 games on this 1game. The best part of this game is that it is free.
B002JM1VJG|3.0|Great videos in their original form, cant help but notice some have been censured. whats worse is the rather notable omissions of a few videos (nothing really matters, and american life) really? y?!?!
0446310786|3.0|I purchased this book after going to three different stores that said they had the book. I bought it for my son who needed it for a school project. The book arrived a day before his deadline to have it. The local library did not have it. Thanks so much to the former owner and Amazon.

159562015X|4.0|The top 5 strengths discovered for me by the computer analytics personality test which one must take thru the internet in conjunction with this book were comfortably accurate, yet initially a tad disappointing in that they didn't surprise me; but I was instantly strongly magnetized by at least another highly achievable strength which I've so far found in the book that needs to more fully complete my overall being's big picture asap!<br /><br />A valuable bonus of this book, is that Strengths Finder 2.0 is a highly reputable excellent companion to the Myers Briggs MBTI personality test, which one may promote on their resumes and online professional professional profiles (as I have), to gainfully help mutual worldly professionals find one another's true tangible talents!

So I've saved myself the cost of buying a new computer for the low cost of this heatsink.  The setup was a little annoying because I had to pull out my whole motherboard from the case. Some cases have a hole on the back of the motherboard side that save you that trouble. It comes with thermal paste too!

B002GYVRRI|5.0|An excellent album and one of the best of the Krims. An album that delivers on every level from the incredible musical virtuosity of the title track to the inspired mini epic length Starless, the CD is all that we love about King Crimson - complex musical genius and lyrics that transcend the norm, lots of jazz fusion and weird drum patterns, and strange instruments mixed with guitars and drums. Every track on this CD is a bonafide classic. 'Fallen Angel' is beautiful and mystifying, 'One More Red Nightmare' is a catchy 7 minute little gem that is one of the best from the band, 'Providence' is what it is - lots of kanoodling with strange instruments that is highly intriguing music. Then there is the absolutely brilliant 'Starless'! Flawless, from end to end of its 12 minute length.<br /><br />Unlike the disappointing content of \\"Starless and Bible Black\\", \\"Red\\" is essential Crimson. Incredible guitar from Fripp is complemented by the intricate time signature patterns of Buford and Wetton is at his best. This lineup of Crimson is about as good as it gets and many fans would agree that it was these musicians that formulated the best material in the huge repertoire of the band. Many of these tracks found their way to the best of Crimson Cd collections available and for good reason.<br /><br />As usual the booklet is excellent with lots of interesting info about the making of this album, the live shows and the songs. There is little else that needs to be said except this is one of those CDs you will not want to miss out on. So try it as soon as you get a chance and I am sure you will be absolutely delighted.

0385534639|3.0|Ordered this book as my final obligation to a certain book club, as I had read so many positive reviews elsewhere.  Kind of wish I had just borrowed it from the library and ordered a different book from the club.  Feel I overpaid.  Very interesting and original storyline.  But book a little too long, and much too dense.  There are pages spent on just describing various objects.  I re-read these passages many times but still couldn't always picture what the author was trying to describe.  I wish more of this detail had been spent on character development.  This would probably make a much better movie than book, due to all the visual details.
145162445X|2.0|As a staunch atheist, I had high hopes for this book.  While I kind of \\"get\\" what Krauss is going for, the material is pretty similar to Victor Stenger's last couple of books.  It was not the revelatory new approach that I had hoped for.  His definition of \\"nothing\\" is more like an absence of matter, or in some cases an absence of space, which is not quite what I imagine when I think about \\"nothing\\".  Quantum fluctuations are still \\"something,\\" as far as I'm concerned.  What went on before the Big Bang 13.72 billion years ago?  While I'm not inclined to look to religion for an answer, I can't imagine this book would persuade anyone who is.  Many of its arguments seem are semantic than I would have liked, and my understanding of how the universe began is about the same as it was previously: I don't know.

B000063UR2|5.0|The director's cut is a masterpiece. If this version had been released in 1985, Legend probably would've been more successful at the box-office. Every image Scott creates on celluloid is a visual treat - easily his best work.  An unrecognizable Tim Curry delivers a stand-out and menacing performance in this beautifully crafted fairy tale. Career-best work from everyone involved.  Unmissable.
B004LWZW4W|3.0|As with all presentations there are promoters as distracters.<br /><br />The product has a sound story. The story stands alone; or if you will can be a prequel to the ape series. There was very little preaching of ideologies and they stuck to the poor pitiful ape finally can get his revenge theme. Someone joker could not help himself and hand to write in the line \\"Get your damn dirty paws off me!\\"<br /><br />Anyway apes get to be the lab animal of choice for a drug that is supposed to cure Alzheimer. The drug gets out of hand the ape gets out of hand and then there is the evil bureaucratic bully who gets out of hand. No one is really a good guy in this film, not even our newly liberated apes.<br /><br />Now where did I see this film before, oh yeah; take out the ape add a dog and voila \\"Watchers\\" (1988) Based on a novel by Dean Koontz.
145162445X|5.0|Great book, well written.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought the book and would recommend the book to anyone interested in the subject.
1400052173|5.0|As with some of the other reviews I found that the truth in the history is almost like reading fiction.  I have been living in Baltimore now for over 10 years.  Some of the places mentioned throughout the book reference places in Baltimore I've been to or go to on an every day  basis yet I never imagined or took the time to understand the history behind these places.  I have heard some of the rumors mentioned in the book from different people that I've encountered the living in Baltimore.  I guess a part of me never wanted to believe the things I was hearing could even be remotely true. Which might explain why I never divulged deeper into understanding or attempting to decipher fact from fiction. Ironically I have met in passing and know people who know or are related to people mentioned in the book yet still until after reading this book had no knowledge of Henrietta Lacks.  This book was eye opening for me.  I don't think I can ever go back to viewing life the same way.  Each day I step outside I now look at and pay more attention to the people I encounter and the places I go.  Baltimore is rich and full of history both good and bad.  Until now I've been viewing it with blinders on.

0374275637|5.0|Daniel Kahneman's premise is deceptively simple. We have two modes of thinking, which he calls System 1 and System 2. System 1 operates automatically, quickly, and effortlessly; System 2 operates deliberately, systematically, and painstakingly. System 1 intuits; System 2 computes. System 1 reacts involuntary; System 2 makes choices. While we use System 1 for most of our waking hours, System 2 relies on System 1 for suggestions based on experience. In a sense, this method is how two minds become one. Excelling in the world demands quick thinking, so our natural capacity to make judgments based on System 1 is an indispensable attribute. After all, we tend to believe our impressions. In effect, Systems 1 and 2 work like well-oiled gears in a high-efficiency machine for most of us.<br /><br />Once Kahneman quickly establishes the distinctions between Systems 1 and 2, he devotes most of the nearly 500 pages of \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" to biases they create and the missteps they engender. Using numerous actual and theoretical anecdotes from his own experience and popular culture, as well as engaging tests for the reader, the author continually returns to WYSIATI (what you see is all there is), a term he uses to explain how we generally make sense of the world--usually with success but possibly to our detriment.<br /><br />WYSIATI helps us to quickly size up new situations and make correct snap judgments based on reality.  However, biases abound from this operating system. We see the world as more logical and predictable than it really is, and, against the advice of the proverbial Wall Street disclaimer, we rely on past results as indicators of future results.<br /><br />Kahneman, a Nobel laureate in economics, details how these distortions cause us to approach decision points with overconfidence, to frame situations improperly, and to rely solely on best-case scenarios, among many other missteps. He lays out a long list of \\"illusions\\" that drive our thinking, including an inaccurate assessment of our understanding or skill, an unreliable dependence on memory, and a misguided belief in pundits--all leading to errant judgments and poor results.<br /><br />One of most revealing points of \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" is that System 1 and System 2 are not always in agreement. At least three facts confirm this condition. For one, says, Kahneman, \\"We believe that duration is important [System 1], but our memory [System 2] tells us it is not. The rules that govern the evaluation of the past are poor guides for decision making, because time does matter.\\" Second, we are inclined to judge our past by the peak-end rule, when our experiences were at their highest or lowest, creating a distorted picture of the past and a seriously flawed projection of the future. A third indication of the dissonance between Systems 1 and 2 is our susceptibility to hindsight, which also misrepresents our actual understanding of past and present events.<br /><br />\\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" is rich with insights about how and why we think. Anyone fascinated with language will find a lot of hidden treasures in this book. Language, insists Kahneman, is an antidote to fallacious thinking: \\"Ultimately, a richer language is essential to the skill of constructive criticism.\\" I could not agree more.understanding or skill, an unreliable dependence on memory, and a misguided belief in pundits--all leading to errant judgments and poor results.

0374275637|5.0|Loved this book.  Kahneman covers so many different topics so clearly, it is an amazing tour de force of how we think.  His ability to clearly explain so much, with grace, clarity and even humor, is a startling topper to a nobel prize winning career.  I was educated and charmed.  In the several weeks that I was reading the book, its lessons popped up constantly around me.  Now I need to take notes on the book to bring it back to my memory, that's tne nature of the mind!

0316017930|4.0|Enjoyed this book with my son, and, it was vintage Gladwell:  well-written, counter-intuitive, good storytelling, selective use of evidence, and overselling of a legitimate point.  In this case that point is that circumstance plays a role in success.  Bill Gates, Joe Flom or any other \\"outlier\\" in success, Gladwell argues benefited from fortunate circumstances, from time and place of birth, to availability of computers, to, in the Flom narrative, the circumstance that anti-semitism forced him into a practice area that would later boom.  Never mind that Gates' subsequent business success had little to do with his programming ability, or that Flom's genius stood out in law school and, absent anti-semitism, likely simply would have excelled in a different legal career, Gladwell makes a good point that has stayed with me in the month since we finished the book.  To be sure outcomes are more than circumstance, but Gladwell's opposite perspective, of course, can be seen in every personal story too, and his storytelling skill makes the argument stay with you.

He travels south so that he can stop the assassination of President Kennedy on 11/23/63. He has plenty of free time before the event, so he settles in a town north of Dallas. There he becomes a school teacher and falls in love. Complications arise in many ways as the obdurate past resists change.

B004EPZ06G|2.0|Just like everybody else is saying: They should have just left the first Hangover alone as a classic in its own right...but they HAD to try to copy the same formula and almost un-originally make a part II that was just a carbon copy and LESS funny.  The movie really sucked....and it was so predictable.  Sure...the first one had its crazy and unrealistic moments...but it was still kind of believable in most parts.  This one just takes it even further and many of the scenes are so unbelievable it's not even worth writing about.  I don't even want to waste too much time writing about how disappointing this was.  It's just like Grease 2.....a HORRIBLE follow-up to a classic (well, kind of a classic).
B00005ASOC|5.0|This is one of those movies that doesn't have lots of CG work or heavy action.  It's just a feel good movie set in an area that kind of moves into lower income housing that engulf the neighborhood of a distinguished writer who refuses to move. It has a few pieces of great music. I bought the album and was I surprised at how unlistenable the music is without the music. LOL  This a calm and thoughtful movie that gives us hope.  It has some basket ball scenes for sports nuts. One thing i love about it is the unspoken racial healing mood of the movie. I have too copies.  So I liked it that well.

1451648537|5.0|I am absolutely shocked at how good this book is...or rather how fantastic the story is of Steve Job's life and times. I'm not an apple fan. The last Apple device I purchased was an Apple IIc back around 1980 or so. So I haven't followed the story of Apple computer. I also don't normally purchase biographies.  I'm about 2/3rds of the way through this book and I'm amazed at the richness of the story. This is hands down, the best book I have read in the last decade. Don't pass it up. Buy it, read it, share it, and read it again. You'll love it.

0765348276|4.0|Scalzi's Hugo-nominated Old Man's War is a very satisfying sci-fi read.  The first in a series of four books, the author takes his time establishing his characters in a way that contributes depth and pathos to his plot.  In this future earth, those in the United States and other developing countries who reach 75 are given the option to live out their remaining days at home or to join the powerful CDF - Colonial Defense Forces - who defend the human outposts throughout the galaxy.  Why would septuagenarians be willing to do that?  Because - in a way that's not commonly known on earth - it would mean a significant extension of their lives in healthy battle-ready bodies.  The universe that these seniors encounter is nothing like the earth they leave behind...

I love that my 2 year old can play.  This game is made in Germany and it is wooden. That is another plus for me.  I highly recommend this game.
B00006DEFA|5.0|This edition, with the extra scenes and choice of three languages, is excellent.  Further, the extra disc, concerning the making of Amadeus in 1988 Prague, before the fall of the Soviet Empire, has some really hilarious moments.  I loved imagining the KGB spies, who were extras in the audiences, confusion. As well as the pranks played on them by the stage crews.

B0064NTZJO|4.0|Drive is definitely entertaining; the production is great - good cinematography, good acting, which leaves to a lot of intrigue and emotional attachment. By the end of the movie, I was definitely on the side of the driver.<br />That said, the story is absurd.. the neighbor's husband just happens to be caught up with the same gangsters that are fronting the driver's stock car? In a 10 million population LA area?? Like the Miz would ask- really? really?<br />Also the driver seems a little young to be taken seriously as the clint eastwood 'man with no name'/avenging angel type of silent badass.<br /><br />Despite the above said however, the movie made me empathize with the driver and left me thinking about what made the character who he is.  Thus, I think it was a thoughtful movie.<br /><br />I also think it is worth watching multiple times.. the soundtrack is cool, the cinematography is great, All of the characters are un-annoying, and it's got lots of satisfying violence against unsavory characters<br /><br />3.5722289 out of 5 stars

B0000029D1|5.0|This CD is awesome, because Stanley pulled in some of the top talent in the jazz world of 1994, and they gave a truly inspired performance of some truly classic tunes. Many groups give weak performances live, but this one leveraged their skills off each other in a way that enriched the complete experience. It includes some tunes from Billy Cobham and Stanley Clark, and some riffs and solos by Stanley that I have not heard topped since.

0393337170|5.0|\\"The Art of Strategy: A Game Theorist's Guide to Success in Business and Life\\" by A. K. Dixit and B. J. Nalebuff is one of the best introductions in game theory, which is defined as the systematic analysis of strategic interactions. The book is differently structured from the previous edition but still a nice read. The topics are covered in a non-perfunctory manner and there is a clear bridge between theory and practice with enough applications to elicit further digging by the interested reader. The cases are quite diverse (pop culture, TV, movies, sports, politics, and history) and the non-technical style is appealing to a large audience. The book is a good resource even for the technical game theorists in need of nice metaphors or examples aimed at decreasing the complexity of presentations.
0385534639|5.0|I actually hadn't heard of this book before, when I stumbled upon it at Barnes & Noble. I loved the cover, which also said \\"autographed copy\\", and so I read the inside sleeve. Just the short synopsis caught my attention and I bought it instantly. Once I stated to read it, it's all I could think about during the day at work. As soon as I would get home, I would rush around so I could read a little more. And then when Saturday rolled around, I read from 7:30am to 2:30pm, finally finishing the book. I was hooked. Amazing writing! It is so hard to find a good book that is written properly these days. I am so glad to have read this \\"random\\" book I found!

0307887898|4.0|This is a great book. Eric stresses the importance of understanding your business from your customers perspective. His thesis is understanding what your customers find valuable is how you are going to build a successful business. When dealing with innovative or disruptive products that can be hard to do. His solution is to get a minimum viable product (MVP) in the hands of customers as early as possible and look at how they respond to it.  He encourages start-ups to continually challenge and test assumptions, always being ready to pivot and understand the metrics that they are using to measure success.<br /><br />I found it interesting when he started talking about the ways to measure how a business could measure itself and how it was important not to use \\"vanity metrics\\". However it would have been nice if he could have gone into a little more detail on the metric selection. A good metric in one business model could become a vanity metric if you changed your market strategy. Though not explicitly spelled out, the important selection criteria for a metric was that it related to business model revenue. It's a short book and I would have liked it to have more case studies so I'm docking a star - but a book every budding entrepreneur should read.

B0000CABBW|5.0|Whale Rider is a touching story about a Maori girl, coming-of-age in modern day New Zealand. The girl, Paikea, struggles with the feeling that she is meant to be part of the Maori tribe and she desperately wants to please her grandfather. Paikea's father, Porourangi, was the first born son of the tribe leader, Koro Apunahni; the role of leadership had been passed down from father to son or grandson for many generations. When Porourangi refused to take leadership, the role fell on his first born son. In the first scenes of the movie, we learn that Paikea's mother and twin brother both died at Paikea's birth. In a struggle with tradition and bitterness towards his granddaughter's position, Koro sets out to find the next great tribe leader. He calls on the first born sons of the tribe and begins to teach them the old ways. Paikea tries to leave with her father to go start a new life away from the tribe, but as they were driving away, she felt the whale calling to her. She could not leave, so each day she went to the meeting house and watched from a window and learned the traditions of her ancestors. What she could not learn from the window or from afar, she learned from her uncle. Paikea tries to gain the acceptance of her grandfather as she learns the ways of the ancestors. The final test of the first-borns' turns up a failed attempt to find the next leader, sending Koro into a state of meditation and reflection. He calls to the ancestors. In feeling his sorrow, Paikea calls out too. When a pod of whales swims ashore, it is believed that the ancestors have answered them, though it is unsure what they were saying until Paikea climbs atop the largest whale and coaxes the pod back into the water. When Paikea is seen riding the whale, the test of her spirit and the message of the ancestors is clear. Paikea will be the next leader and the first girl to ever lead her people.   Whale Rider portrays many cultural themes of indigenous tribes including the importance of tradition, animism, ancestrism, initiations, and - most importantly - women's roles. It paints a beautiful portrayal of the life of Maori people and how they carry on the traditions of their forefathers with the utmost respect and diligence. The film captures the essence of their people and colors a portrait indigenous sacred ways. Through animism, the whale is their animal totem, a symbol of their heritage and a reminder of their ancestors' journey. The initiation depicted in this story follows the passing down of tradition from fathers to sons, the \\"coming-of-age\\" struggle. Tradition is the most important factor in the lives of many indigenous cultures. Tradition is what determines destiny and also what determines the role one will play in their everyday lives. For the Maori, the tribe leader had traditionally been male, going back in time all the way to the ancient ones. Maori women also played a key role in teaching the traditions to their children. Paikea's grandmother shared with her the stories and calls of their ancestors. Tradition may have been broken with Paikea in becoming the chief, but tradition also took a step forward by helping them create a new tradition. The messages that her ancestors sent were through the death of her brother, her name, her strong will, her determination, her respect for everyone and her ride on Paikea's whale. In the last scene of the movie, when the waka is hauled into the sea, it is an inspiring observation that there are also women rowing alongside the men. I would assume that, traditionally, the waka would have also been reserved for men only. Learning to embrace changing a tradition while keeping the essence of their culture the same is a powerful message in the progress of a people - a new story that can be passed down for generations to come.

0062082353|5.0|I listened to the book on my iPod rather than buy the book. I'm glad I did. I got more out of his writing listening to the inflection of the reader. I feel the same way as Chris does on many of the issues. I have never been in combat and this book has given me an appreciation of the work the guys do outside the wire. As a healthcare professional, I too have held those that died. I understand the frustration being good at your job and cannot do a damn thing to prevent the death. I've taken care of veterans that have been through combat, had friends not to return and cry looking for them. I've had remind more than one where they were and how I was. That 1000 yard stare is not good when they are looking right through you. This is one book I'll be listening to more than once. I'm sure to get something new from each I listen to it. Chris, I think you for your service and may your life will continue to be full.

0385344228|5.0|Note:  This review is written to try and ensure that I leave no spoilers.  This book's appeal lies in what the reader thinks will be the climax, only to be jolted by unexpected events beyond the courtroom drama.<br /><br />I'd not read the two \\"crime novels\\" that William Landay has previously written (both received awards), but I'm drawn to the genre and most certainly will read them now.  \\"Defending Jacob\\" draws you in and refuses to allow you to let go before you finish it.  Would that I'd gotten it on Kindle so that I could have traveled easily with it and grabbed spare moments while waiting for the valet, in line at the coffee shop, etc.<br /><br />Landay sets his novel in familiar territory, as he has worked in courtrooms in the Boston area.  In a more or less typical suburb, Newton, the town is shocked by a tragedy of a 14 year old boy, Ben Rifkin, murdered before school starts in a local park that is the venue of joggers and kids walking to school.  First Assistant DA Andy Barber takes the case for himself when the call comes in and goes directly to the crime scene.<br /><br />But the book does not begin there.  Instead, in the beginning, and throughout the novel, Landay starts the book with Barber (the \\"Witness\\") testifying before a grand jury to his nemesis, ADA Neal Logiudice.  Throughtout the novel, as the grand jury testimony is layered into the story of Ben Rifkin's murder (standing out easily, as the author used significantly different form and type to separate it from the ongoing crime tale) the reader wonders whether the confrontation between<br />Barber and Logiudice is real or imagined, and, if so, in what context.  To say that the reader cannot completely evaluate the grand jury testimony until the novel is finished, the story is told, and the reader is left to imagine, is to underplay the importance of the manner in which Landay conceived and sold this brilliant novel.<br /><br />During the investigation and trial of the suspected murderer of Ben Rifkin, Andy's own son, 14 year old Jacob Barber is the prime suspect. The novel talks about Andy's removal from the case, the isolation of his family, the trial, and the aftermath.  Much of the last few chapters roll over the reader like waves.  But the genius of the nuanced, intricately written account is not about the trial scenes, but rather more about what happens to a family, to parental love and knowing, to the relationship between two parents who have raised a young man that they thought was one type of kid, and is shockingly revealed to potentially be someone they never really understood or knew.<br /><br />You don't just read \\"Defending Jacob\\"... you contemplate it.  You compare the book's twists and turns, the actions of Andy Barber and his wife Laurie, to your own appraisal of families and familial love of parents for their children.  You confront the questions of the actions of a community, the isolation of adolescents, the impact of the internet and social media and the potential for inherited behavior all at once.<br /><br />And you come away realizing that the characters you have watched throughout the story, though deeply flawed, may not be much different in their reactions to a tragedy than your own family would be.  Stunning in its plotting, with a couple of over the top twists, \\"Defending Jacob\\" was the best fiction novel I read in 2011.<br /><br />My hopes are that the reading public discovers it when it is published in late January and gives it the position on the best seller lists that it truly deserves.<br /><br />Highly recommended.arber is the prime suspect.

B004A8ZWWE|3.0|Oh come on...5 stars???  The special effects were fantastic but it ends there. The script was definitely geared towards little kids, the acting was subpar and they tried too hard to be the hip movie (i.e. the kid dancing with the robot was just too much). I know some will disagree with me, but the kid's character in this movie was annoying.  If I was 10 again I probably would have enjoyed it more, but as an adult I was expecting much more out of it. Rent it first before buying.

B005XRUPSC|5.0|I was so excited to learn that Florence + the machine was releasing another album! After thoroughly enjoying their first 2 releases (Lungs, and Lungs-the b-sides),I snatched this one up the day it was released on Amazon. And it did not disapoint. Compared to their first album, this one has more slow gorgeous \\"ballad\\" type songs, with a good mix of upbeat tracks as well. The harps and keyboards are more in the backround than they are on the first album, but you don't really notice because the focus is on Florence's voice.<br />I believe this stayed in the cd player in the car for a month (maybe two) straight when first obtained before I was ready to listen to something else.<br /><br />Favorites on this album are:<br /><br />Never let me go<br />No light, no light<br />Leave my body<br />Remain Nameless<br />Strangeness and Charm<br />Heartlines

0740797719|4.0|I found this book helpful.  I've been painting w/oils off and on for about 25 years and am pretty much a realist painter. At first I was a little put off by the fantasy/illustrative art, but soon realized that the author was conveying more than just a formula for illustration.  I think that he offers some basic structures that can help you when you're looking at your painting and are not quite sure what is wrong, or how you can strengthen certain areas.  I guess, putting it another way, how you can look more objectively at your work.  I also found his approach to color analysis interesting and came away with some ideas I'd like to try.  The author also shared many of his works beyond just his illustrative work (which, I'll admit, I begin to appreciate more).  All in all, it was worth buying.
159562015X|3.0|On one hand, I like that this book compellingly describes a wide variety of strengths and helps with understanding others that have different styles from one's own. On the other, there really weren't any surprises. I took this 'test' as part of a group and no one was surprised with the results that they got -- nearly all were exactly what we would have selected for ourselves. I like pop-psych books so I wasn't surprised or disappointed... but I would have liked a little *something* extra for the effort.

B0068TL23G|4.0|I took this faotd figuring it might be a fun time waster. I was not disappointed. Having more ability to edit the paths would be cool (how about double tap to erase a path?). My six year old is now into it as well. So I go my money's worth.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It has been a while since I was so deeply invested in the characters of a book. As I started reading this book I quickly became engrossed in the story and before I knew it the characters had connected with me in an inextricable way.  I don't want to say too much because I don't want to give anything away; but, I do highly recommend reading this book and I am thrilled that things are in the works to make this into a movie!  It could be an Oscar award winning movie in many categories if done correctly.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really like my cover. I wanted something to protect my Kindle Fire from scratches and getting dirty while being slim-lined. It does it for me.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I first saw this movie in the theaters, and loved it.  I decided I needed to buy a copy to show to my children and grandchildren, to explain to them how it was during those days of the 50's and 60's.  Not enough  has been taught in our schools about how segregation, stereotypes, and profiling affected children and people in those days.  Although not raised in the south, I was subject to many of those same racial slurs, by my parents, and friends, about \\"colored people\\"!  I went out of my way to discover, on my own, just what Black people were all about, much to the dismay of my parents!

0439796644|5.0|Very good book.  Different ending than the movie, but equally pleasing! I did not expect the book to be so small, but it was just as readable.
B0068TL23G|4.0|It took me about 20 minutes to beat the whole game. I kept thinking I missed something! Needs more levels/difficulty to be worth money.<br /><br />Edit:  Whoops, saw a review that explained it, I was missing something!  Obviously a ui fail, it is not clear that there are more levels.  Gave it another star.
B000002J03|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums of all time! In my opinion, this album set the trend for Heavy Metal Rock as we know it today. The band utilized several recording studios in the creation of this album, with Jimmy Page ultimately receiving the credit for the entire production.<br />It was during this album that Robert Plant began to feel comfortable recording with the band because of the strict demands that were placed on his vocal abilities. He had actually thought about quitting the band prior to this!<br />The album was released on October 22, 1969 on Atlantic Records. With an advance order of 400,000 copies, it took its place as number one in the U.S., replacing \\"Abbey Road\\" by The Beatles' twice, and remained there for seven weeks.<br />Tracks include:<br />  Side one<br />1)Whole Lotta Love<br />2)What Is and What Should Never Be<br />3)The Lemon Song<br />4)Thank You<br /><br />  Side two<br />1)Heartbreaker<br />2)Living Loving Maid(She's Just a Woman)<br />3)Ramble On<br />4)Moby Dick<br />5)Bring It On Home<br /><br />To me, this entire album feels as if it is one unending track. It should be classified as an \\"emotion\\" because of the ambience it creates when it is listened to. I have researched this album and found that it has gone platinum 12 times over-and that was in 1999!<br />In January 1970, \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" was released as a condensed single against the bands wishes. I can't say that I blame them much-it's like reading only the first and last page of a book. \\"Living Loving Maid\\" was released on the \\"B\\" side of the 45RPM.<br />The cover of the album was designed by David Juniper. The band told him to come up with something \\"interesting\\".<br />What he came up with, was duplicating a WWI picture of the Red Baron (Manfred von Richthofen) with the infamous \\"German Flying Circus\\". Picturing the outline of a Zeppelin on a brown background, the album was nicknamed `The Brown Bomber\\".<br />Jimmy Page is a true genius and a pioneer of rock and roll. With his contribution to music and his unique flair for creativity, he gave us \\"finger taps\\" and \\"neck shredding\\". His \\"riff's\\" have led rock and roll to new heights inspiring musicians, Steve Vai, Eddie Van Halen, Aerosmith, and Guns And Roses.<br />I never get tired of listening to this album, (and I don't feel like I'm alone here,) I somehow feel that it will never drop off the charts. Obviously, I love the album in its entirety, but if I had to choose a favorite, it would have to be \\"Ramble On.\\" It's a peaceful song that fills my heart with contentment, and I hear it at least once a week on the local Rock station here in Tennessee.s\\" and \\"neck shredding\\".

0553386794|1.0|After hearing so much hoopla about the series I thought I would give it a shot.  After forty pages into the first installment of the series I threw it in the trash can. Actually, I sold it to a used bookstore.<br />I can't believe this guy is being compared to Tolkien. There is no comparison here.<br /><br />The dialect was terrible.<br />The storyline was boring.<br />The sex was offensive.<br /><br />End of story.

B000P6BFGM|1.0|While some people may think this was another charlie's angels movie poking fun at the 70s version . . . it was actually just a simple joke of a movie. i think i even saw the blue screen behind people in a few action shots. it was total farse and not even in a good way. it was bad acting. drew barrymore looked chubby and sick . . . like she was literally sick  . . . she seemed stiff and like she couldn't move. there were just weird direction in it too. i mean they fall off of a building (landing in some stupid synchronized pose of course on the ground) and it took two other scenes to show before coming back to them for them to all gasp and cough (like when you think someone drowned but they really didn't silliness you see in other movies and on tv) only after being shot while wearing bullet proof vests. also this movie seemed to make fun of black americans using black americans. it was kinda stereotyping them with self-deprecating humor which was just weird too. berny mack added absolutely nothing to this film. and his mother (who was an actress on Good Times fell flat too). demi moore looked like she could barely walk without a cane let alone twirl around in the air while shooting people while wearing stilettos and keeping her head pointed forward with that long mane of hers. and thinking about the convent/creepy man story . . . well this movie just seemed like an SNL skit on the first drew barrymore charlie's angels movie which i thought was entertaining. no wonder you have to buy this one instead of renting it. . . they know the word would spread and they would never make up the money from this disaster.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This story combines magic with science, romance with academia and the mysteries of history with the realities of modern life.  Finally, a female character with real flaws, but who is at the same time, smart and heroic as she accepts herself and risks it all for the love she's finally let into her life.  Romantic without being graphic and impossible to put down, this book has just enough science, genetics and history to make a layperson want to learn more.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|In \\"The Help,\\" Skeeter Phelan (Emma Stone) returns to early 1960s Jackson, Mississippi from college and takes a job at a newspaper writing a homemaking column.  As she becomes aware of the plight of the black maids who serve prominent Mississippi families, she desires to write from their perspective.<br /><br />Minny Jackson (Octavia Spencer), Aibileen Clark (Viola Davis), and the other maids are initially reluctant to relate their experiences to Skeeter, as the monstrous Jim Crow system is still very much in effect--in the Deep South of that time, blacks who defied the system were brutalized, and whites who spoke out against it became pariahs.  However, the maids ultimately decide to cooperate as the oppression mounts.<br /><br />The story is outstanding, the movie does a great job of evoking a sense of time and place, there are funny scenes even though this is primarily a drama, and the actresses turn in great performances.  When I first saw the film I thought that the villainy of the Hilly character (Bryce Dallas Howard) was implausibly overdone, but I changed my mind.  The maids were apparently instructed to constantly tell the children that they raised that \\"you is kind, you is smart, you is important.\\"  If in that time and place children were fed an entire childhood and youth full of those little daily affirmations, it wouldn't exactly come as a shock if an occasional Hilly-style monster was produced.<br /><br />\\"The Help\\" is a powerful film portraying courageous stands against injustice.  History buffs would love the movie, and it is one of the very few films I have attended at the theater at which the audience burst into applause at the conclusion.
B0068TL23G|5.0|Challenging game as you progress. A game that makes you think but not overtly complex.  Quickly get lost in a puzzler and sincere enjoyment worth the shortest path.
B006Z00R1Q|5.0|This movie was good, oh yeah it was good.  I saw it at my place and thought it was really good.  What I liked about the movie 1) it was good 2) it was scary.  If you like my review, please leave a really good comment.

B003UD7JEE|5.0|Nikita is action packed, every episode leaves you wanting more. The writing is great, but the acting is even better! It's a female-driven action series. Which follows Nikita's efforts in bringing down Division, a secret agency that trained her into becoming an agent and assassin. The show is AMAZING!

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This has got to be the most amazing book I have ever read. I've never experienced such emotion and fear while reading before. Their journey to survival is remarkable and you feel emotionally attached to Katniss, and Peeta. I laughed, I cried, and I couldn't put it down. It took me less than two days to finish. If that doesn't tell you anything than nothing will.
0393338827|5.0|I'm a voracious reader and this is one of the best books I've ever read.  It's true that I'm generally interested in finance but even if you're not a finance junkie, you'll enjoy this book.  Some of the technical explanations of CDOs and credit default swaps are confusing (Wall Street bond traders designed them this way) but it's easy enough to follow the gist of the story.  Michael Lewis is an amazing writer and this book really displays his talents.  The book focuses much of its attention on a few of the intriguing individuals who foresaw the mortgage collapse.  I especially loved the explanation of how these contrarian investors had experiences throughout their lives that helped them to swim against the tide when it really mattered.  It takes courage to do what nobody else is doing and this book focuses on a few guys who truly had chutzpah.  After reading this book, I'm a huge Michael Burry fan and I hope that he reopens Scion Capital so that the rest of us can benefit from his powerful mind.  I saw at least one review that faulted Lewis for not centering the book around a political theme but I'd have to disagree with this argument.  It's so refreshing that Lewis lets the story speak for itself without diving into polarizing politics.  Did Wall Street go crazy for a few years?  Yes, but both Democrats and Republicans played a crucial role in creating this housing bubble and they were no better at seeing what was going on.  The only politician that predicted the mortgage crisis was Ron Paul, whose predictions were eerie.  I loved this book and I'm now very eager to read all the other Michael Lewis books I haven't gotten around to yet!

B004NDVJA0|5.0|I bought this CD at the recommendation of a friend.  Remarkably, this friend and I haven't seen each other since Middle School, years and years ago; however, it was like this would be a panacea for most discriminating ears.  The folky sound of her voice (bordering on ethereal) with the muted piano is quite a combination to enjoy.  I have found that the music, as well as the vocals on this CD are most pleasant to the human ear...even to the point of it \\"soothing the savage beast\\" that is my cat, in a carrier, in my car...on the way to the Vet!  He quietly settled in for the ride today, instead of carrying on like a cat being tortured!  Thank you, Agnes Obel, for your well-performed songs.

B000089Q9D|5.0|Anyone who has believes in love, the kind of love that will wait for months in the rain, the kind of love that lets go but never forgets, needs to see this film. If I were to ever marry and have kids I would want them to see this film when they grew up. There are scenes that, when they play, now, even 22 years later, can't help but bring me to tears, the beauty, sadness, and longing hit so close to home. I fell in love with this movie as a young adult, and two decades later, it has no less of a special place in the heart. I remember as a young man embracing the the poignant father/son relationship between Alfredo and Salvatore, and as an older man, I've met, and lost my personal Elena as well. Maestro Ennio Morricone's score here cuts through to your soul, and lingers to remind you, that, wherever you are, the love that you have for those that life has taken away doesn't leave you, it's inside you, even as you move on. This film is a timeless treasure.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|I just got my gaming pad today. Its pretty rad. I bought this for SWTOR because i figured it'd work better than using my laptop keyboard. I think its gonna work out phenomenally, its just going to take me a good week or so to get use to using it, since this is the first gaming pad ive ever used. Some pros are...ANY COLOR....and i mean ANY COLOR that you can possibly imagine, can be selected as your screen/key light! Which i think is freakin awesome! It seems to be well made ergonomically speaking. There are a ton of programmable keys. And its very easy to program. Again...this was my first pad, and actually swtor is the first real mmo experience ive ever really had, so using macros and such is new to me as well, and i was able to figure it all out via trial and error(but quickly none the less). Seems quite sturdy as well.  Cons...No swtor preset, but watever, just take 5 min outta your day and make 1! seriously not that hard. I know that majority of the ppl whom gave this item a bad review or low rating, were complaining about the size...i have avg-slightly largr size hands(about 7.5-8\\" long) and a few keys are slightly hardr to reach than others. But how u macro makes all the difference in the world obviously. I programmed the joystick for movement, so i need my thumb on the right, but still need to reach the far left for quickslot changing i programmed. in a battle, im not really moving my guy so much cuz im DPS focused, and i mainly use my mouse for moving, and the joystick for my laziness and for slight movement mods, so the stretch doesnt really bug me that much, but it might for other ppl. Its really not that bad either, just a lil bit bigger than i was expecting.  So overall i would DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!!!!!! WITHOUT A DOUBT! Great product, works well, aesthetically pleasing, ergonomic(to my hands/wrists at least), sturdy, and very simple to setup! 5.5 outta 5(if possible)!
1589795474|5.0|If you think most millionaires have everything you wish you had in life think again.  Most true millionaires don't drive fancy cars, have huge houses, or wear expensive jewelry.  They have strict budgets, work very hard, and invest most of their income.  This book teaches you what it really means to be wealthy.  American culture will make you think celebs and athletes are rich and wealthy when in reality they are not worth anywhere near what they should be.  You also don't have to make $500,000 a year to become a millionaire.  This book will teach you exactly what it means to be truly wealthy.  So what's it going to be are you going to live life as a PAW or UAW?
0545123291|5.0|I can't believe I'm saying this, but Linger is even better than Shiver! In fact, Shiver doesn't even come close to the quality of Linger. Nope. Not even close. Why is Linger completely and utterly a better read than Shiver, you might be asking? Well, there are a million reasons, but I'll only subject you to 5.<br /><br />Reason #1: The POVs of Isabella and Cole are now included. In Shiver, Maggie Stiefvater only wrote in Sam's and Grace's points of view. Don't get me wrong - I loved that she did that. I actually didn't even realize what I was missing until I read the story with Isabella as the first-person narrator. It made me like her character a whole lot more than I previously did.<br /><br />Reason #2: The development of the characters. The author did an incredible job developing the characters. I found out a lot more about Grace and Sam, about Cole's background, and Isabella's reasons for being the way she is. I especially loved reading the scenes with Cole and his band mates.<br /><br />Reason #3: The addition of Cole. He's the damaged bad boy that every girl falls in love with - including me. Though my favorite's Sam, Cole certainly has a special place in my heart.<br /><br />Reason #4: It didn't feel like there was a piece missing because it was lacking action. In my review for Shiver, I mentioned how it would have been better if there had been some fighting scenes. I don't feel that that is the case with Linger. Unlike the first book, this one was a great read without any major battles.<br /><br />Reason #5: The End. I am decidedly crazy about the ending! It was EPIC!!! I don't want to spoil it for you, but I will say this: You will not be disappointed! The way it was written just reinforces my believe that Stiefvater is one of the best YA authors ever.<br /><br />If you have not realized yet, I am enchanted by this book! I think you would be insane not to read it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is amazing!  It reads to you and has tons of translations and plans. Im glad I got this app. It also.helps me read my Bible everyday. So this hleps a lot. I recommend it to everyone.!

I got it for use on my D7000, takes a second or two to plug in, another couple seconds to put camera on tripod, then click away.

B000059MEK|5.0|I don't really think people need reviews on music, because if you like it, you like it. And if you get a good enough sample of the music on an album, you'll know if you like it.<br /><br />Of course I love this album because I like this kind of music and Daft Punk is my favorite band. But it is a great album and it's one of Daft Punk's best albums. There isn't any music in this album that I don't like.<br /><br />The album cover that comes with this includes some background on each track: lyrics, who sung, etc. And on the opposite side of the album cover there is a poster of Daft Punk. There is also a set of instructions on the cover on how to access the Daft Club site (which is not up anymore) using your membership card (which is not included.)<br /><br />Overall, it is a very great album.

0525423656|1.0|Where do I start?<br /><br />This book's most egregious sin is that it is absolutely BORING. Nothing happens in the entire book. Nothing of consequence is revealed. The entire book could have been summarized into one chapter or less.<br /><br />The other huge problem I had with this book is the switching between two narrators. Normally, this technique does not bother me, but Ms. Condie writes both Ky and Cassia in exactly the same voice. I mean - EXACTLY. Because of this, I constantly lost track of who the narrator was and had to flip back and forth.<br /><br />The story left me both bored and confused. One is bad - both together are horrible.<br /><br />Also, if you plan to read this book (and you probably shouldn't), you should go back and reread Matched immediately before. I read Matched when it was first released and Crossed is not written in a way that it reminds the reader what happened in Matched. In fact, there were some things that were mentioned 3/4 of the way in (e.g. Cassia being an excellent sorter) that I had forgotten about and would have been useful to have been reminded of earlier in the book.

B005IGVYUG|5.0|A clattering bumpy ride of an album, this is Tom Waits at his visceral best. \\"Bad As Me\\" as the Waits persona as God's last drunken bluesman rising from the gutter to try and find what is better, even if even he knows it's all a myth. All you have to imagine is the man with the beaten suitcase at a train station, aware that baggage follows you everywhere you go, bit \\"maybe things will be better in Chicago.\\" It's a theme that rolls along from beginning to end of \\"Bad As Me,\\" with the final chorus of Auld Lang Syne fades from the lament of losers gathered on \\"New Year's Eve.\\" It's a collection of songs worthy of Waits best albums, like \\"Rain Dogs,\\" \\"Swordfishtromboines\\" or even early work like \\"Blue Valentine.\\"<br /><br />Tom has also assembled what could be his best band in many a year. Marc Ribot leads an all-star cast of guitarists, including Keith Richards and Los Lobos' David Hildago (who gets the best licks in the rocking \\"Let's Get Lost\\"). It's Ribot's typical pick and stab style that makes the greatest impression on the tougher numbers, including the exceptional \\"Hell Broke Luce.\\" Punctuated by Ribot (and Richards) guitar snap, New Orleans Brass and sampled machine gun fire, Waits barks about the soldiers we've dumped in Iraq and Afghanistan and then forgotten.<br /><br />\\"The Big **** bomb made me deaf,<br />A Humvee mechanic put his Kevlar on wrong?<br />I guarantee you'll meet up with a suicide bomb.\\"<br /><br />Then ends with the soldier/narrator home, blind, deaf and broke, cursing \\"What is next?\\" It could be the most powerful song he's ever written. Waits does have a sense of humor, though, and that comes through in the non-sequiturs that make up the title track, but goes a bit overboard when he quotes \\"Mr Jagger, and Mr Richards\\" while singing a song about getting \\"Satisfied\\" as Keith riffs away behind him. It's \\"Bad as Me's\\" only misfire, the rest of the album is just a kick. Given the usual long waits for Waits, \\"Bad As me\\" is well worth the time it took to arrive.
B0034G4P9E|5.0|This movie is so much more than a just a movie about MMA. The human relationships, brothers, fathers, family and the complicated emotions surrounding all of those relationships is the heart of the story.

I love it when you start reading a book and you don't want to put it down and at the same time don't want to finish it b/c you want it to never end.  This book grabbed me from the first chapter and from then until the last sentence it was sweet satisfaction.

161129522X|5.0|One of Follett's best.  He knows how to tell a great story with both fictional and historical characters interestingly interwoven.  Got my attention from the first page, kept my attention throughout and I was sorry when the book ended.  I am looking forward to the next two books in this trilogy.

B006IGZWB2|5.0|We watched this tonight, and having lived in the racially charged climate of the South in the 60s, this was heartbreaking, and ultimately uplifting and vindicating. I was very happy to take my sons along for a ride that I have described to them from memories of things witnessed in person. We laughed and completely enjoyed it from start to finish. Two thumbs up!

1401937519|5.0|I am almost at a loss for words. Reading Dying to Be Me was a beautiful profound experience. This book is SO potent. Absolutely brilliant, moving and inspirational. It is written in a way that is easy to read, it flows well, and it has the power to change lives for the sublimely better. I can not recommend it enough. I agree with Dr Wayne Dyer: If you only read one book this year you should make it [Dying to Be Me]!!
B006AZZPCM|1.0|Will not load any video to watch or dl on my kindle fire. I would rate this at zero stars if that were possible.

B006P0FIB0|3.0|If you're looking for your next movie to showcase for great 3D, The Three Musketeers delivers the same great 3D you've seen in Resident Evil Afterlife 3D, as Paul W.S. Anderson returns as director and has not lost his 3D touch (currently filming Resident Evil: Retribution 3D, which looks equally great from the 3D trailer as of Jan 2012). How good is the 3D here? Anderson learned his 3D from the Fusion 3D used on Avatar. Any more questions? Exceptional 3D in depth and the occasional pop outs.<br /><br />Moving on to the movie itself, I went in with the expectations that the film would deliver interesting, like-able characters, a decent storyline and plenty of great action. They sort of got the last part right, but the rest is debatable IMO.<br /><br />Characters: The lead hero is portrayed as an arrogant jerk, and the Three Musketeers are directionless, without a goal when the film gets underway. So who do I root for? Milla Jovovich of course. Too bad she didn't have a bigger role. Orlando Bloom appears, but does little more than talk for the few moments he appears.<br /><br />Storyline: The story needs a strong goal right from the start. Without it, the film feels directionless and pointless. Just some clueless characters wandering about waiting for something to do, is how I perceived it. And I wanted to enjoy the film, but by the end, I didn't care how great the 3D was, I couldn't wait to leave the theater. But that's just one opinion. Another viewing might change the bad taste.<br /><br />Action: Good action when it appears. The sword fights are good, but fencing is limited in the amount of jabs and strikes you can do. More creativity is welcome here. The other action scenes, ranging from Milla squeezing through some obstacle courses, to an in air battle of floating ships, are pretty well done and woke me up in the theater, but if you don't care about the characters, it's still hollow action.<br /><br />Visuals: Great scenery and elaborate costumes if you like the style, top notch lighting and cinematography. Solid special effects.<br /><br />If you like Pirate movies, then you may very well enjoy this. The setting is France, with all of the etiquette, pomp and circumstance, frilly wardrobes and prissy attitudes to go with it, notably displayed by the intentionally annoying King.<br />Decent at best.<br /><br />Film: 5/10<br />Story: 4/10<br />Characters: 6/10<br />Action: 8/10<br />Visuals: 8/10<br />3D: 9/10 EXCELLENT.<br />Overall: 6/10 (not an average, saved by the 3D and action). If you need another 3D action movie for your 3DTV, the 3D will not disappoint. The movie on the other hand...style, top notch lighting and cinematography.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|The cover for my Kindle works just fine.  It will stand up by itself if I so desire and it offers protection to the screen.  I do find that a stylus works better with the Kindle but that does not detract from the utility of this cover
B006UKC566|4.0|If you need another cool action movie with an epic ending battle sequence that lives up to the hype, coupled with some great 3D, The Immortals 3D is the disc to buy.<br /><br />3D: Great depth, where the foreground, mid and background are all separate from each other most of the time. The movie doesn't look flat, but pops out nicely. Granted, it was converted by a stereographic 3D team using the 2D film, but what's here is well done, even if there are a few minor flaws here and there.<br /><br />Action: If you enjoy the well filmed, easy to follow and very stylish action and slow motion sequences of Watchmen and 300, you'll enjoy this. The last fourth of the movie is practically all out brutal action.<br /><br />Story: The lead god has a son and trains him to be a hero, to defeat the evil Empire. Basic, but easy to follow.<br /><br />Movie: 8/10<br />Story: 7/10<br />Action: 9/10<br />Characters: 7/10<br />Acting: 7/10<br />3D: 8/10. Well done overall, with clear depth/pop and pop out.<br /><br />Recommended? YES. This is similar to 300, only in 3D.
B0053JJLLC|4.0|When Michael Crichton passed away in 2008 he left in irreperable hole in the literary world.  His inventiveness and ability to tell a great story while passing along cutting-edge knowledge remain unmatched.  Thankfully, Richard Preston stepped in to complete Crichton's unfinished final manuscript, MICRO.  Yes, we've seen the Richard Matheson \\"Shrinking Man\\" and even been subjected to \\"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids\\" --- but in the hands of Crichton and Preston, they take this genre to new 'heights'!  The micro world has never been depicted wich such vivid realism and brutal scientific data.  Average insects are turned into nearly indestructable giant monsters and the small band of scientists that have been shrunk down to half-inch size and placed in the micro world by the crazed owner of a DNA lab must combine all of their knowledge of this world to be able to survive.  The suspense is high-tension and the kills are swift and ugly.  The only thing that slows this book down is the uninteresting characters ---even the villain, Vin Drake.  You will find yourself rooting for the next slick kill rather than for the group of mini-scientists to actually survive.  The ending wraps up decently and MICRO will give nightmares to those who have no idea about the power of nano-technology.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|LOVE IT! And I am picky.  I was screaming at the TV for the underdog!  This is what it's all about. Cheering and hoping for the average little guy.  I saw rotten tomatoes didn't give it much praise... but watched it anyway and am So glad I did!  also , the kid in this was amazing:)  I love him and the robot!
B004EPYZXK|5.0|The movie came quick in perfect condition. The movie started off slow to me, that was expected but not as long as I found it, that was irritating. After the slow go of it, it was a very surprisingly good moving. I will not spoil it for anyone but it wasn't at all what I thought. I would recommend the movie to another. I gave it a five star for being a \\"surprise\\" which I enjoyed. I hope this helps someone. I don't like spolier's so I will not say further other than u will enjoy this movie. Long start and all. And leave it at that. Enjoy. Amazon Rocks!
B003L77GG0|3.0|There were some problems in the wrapping up of the series, but still this season  was better than whole Doomsday arc they had prior.  I have a few complaints though.  I'll be a bit vague to prevent spoiling anything.  1) I have no idea what the heck was going on with Alison Mack.  They kept putting  her in and taking her out of the credits which would be fine if they did that with  all involved, but seems to be short changing her by not having her properly there  every time.  2) Kristin Kreuk only appear via flash back.  3) The solutions for Lex Luthor and Jimmy Olsen are lame.  4) The mirror box arc was mostly good, but some of the Dark Seid solutions, not so much.  I'd say that overall it was good enough, but I felt there was enough missing to make it  not as satisfying as I hoped.

B0062NAX1U|4.0|I thought this was a very well made movie, catching various situations we all challenge everyday in our lives. God works in mysterious ways, that's the truth, all we need do is to believe and love him for saving our lives on the cross and he will be there to help. I think this movie helps people to understand how important love, caring, and faith are to each person. If we live and love for God, everything will workout for the best in our lives.

B000I8ERVM|3.0|How do you review this kind of film? I suppose I have to break this in two.  First, the quality of the film itself.  As a work of art, \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is a good film. It's suspenseful and well-paced, and it does in places scare you, particularly, I suppose, if you for some reason in the year of 2012 have managed to make yourself believe in demonic possession. It grips you and doesn't let you go, and has a certain degree of uncertainity throughout, as you're always never quite sure who is going to win the trial, or if the character really is possessed by demons.  Then, a few words on the actual facts, and the ethics of making this kind of film.  It tells the tale of a young girl who started to suffer from epileptic seizures and delusions, which a fundamentalist priest took to be signs of demonic possessions. They convinced her to end her psychiatric treatment and undergo exorcisms, and didn't relent even as she showed no signs of recovery and refused to eat or drink. Emily Rose eventually died of malnutrition, and the court drama follows the trial until the priest, obviously suffering from illnesses himself, is convicted of manslaughter.  \\"The Exorcism of Emily Rose\\" is \\"based on a true story\\", and tugs at heart-strings by pretending to be spreading a late girl's tale to the world because this is what she wanted while she was alive. It has a supernatural undertone even though everything in the film has perfectly plausible natural explanations, most of which are provided in the film itself. At the end there's a note about how Emily's grave has become a pilgrim's destination, which is particularly arrogant given that the girl never even existed in the first place (the producers of the film for some reason did not even bother to get Annelise Michel's name right).  This film reminds of Versace's upcoming work based on the July 22nd Norway attacks. Take a true tragedy (a mentally ill girl taken off of treatment and starved to death while subjected to pseudoscientific \\"treatment\\"), slap on a \\"true story\\" sticker and some transparent nonsense about \\"letting the story be known\\" or \\"dedicated to the victims\\", and then throw together some fictionalized, Hollywood dreck with little resemblance to, not to mention respect for, the real-world tragedy or its victims. Publish, cash in, rinse and repeat.  I wonder if the producers of the film, and the believers in exorcism, would have chosen the same course of action had Annelise Michel had delusions that were not Christian in nature (which they of course were, given she was raised in a fundamentalist Christian household). What if it were an anorectic girl who decided to stop eating? A schizophrenic boy who believed the government controlled him through a microchip injected by vaccine into his arm? Would they have backed up these delusions, too, and allowed these patients to die? Is every psychotic patient in hospitals around the world right in their delusions, or is this only the case when the delusion can somehow be associated with Christianity?  In closing, I wish to state that I cannot express in words how disgusted I am with this film and the countless tragedies exorcisms has caused, and continue to cause, in the world. Watch The Exorcism of Emily Rose not as a \\"true story\\", but as a stern warning about the dangers of superstition.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Sturdy yet flexible cover has become a part of my Kindle Fire.  Love how the velcro strap keeps the flap in place either in front or in back, and becomes a stand.  The color, pink, is great.  I would highly recommend this cover.
0316236535|5.0|This book is a constant favorite in our classroom.  The two year olds enjoy hearing the simple text and using the pictures to help retell the story themselves.  It's a great way to reinforce color concepts as well as discuss things that are scary.  The kids love looking through the eye holes on the cover and pretending they are the big green monster.  Overall, a great way to show kids that monsters aren't really scary.

0545259088|5.0|There are two books that have ever made me cry. Maggie Stiefvater has written both of them. Shiver being the first one. Forever being number two.<br /><br />\\"In Maggie Stiefvater's Shiver, Grace and Sam found each other. In Linger, they fought to be together. Now, in Forever, the stakes are even higher than before. Wolves are being hunted. Lives are being threatened. And love is harder and harder to hold on to as death comes closing in.\\"<br /><br />I've waited so long to be able to read this book. It was totally and completely worth the wait.<br /><br />Grace is fighting to stay human, and almost fails at simply staying alive. Sam is fighting to save her. Cole is fighting to do the impossible. And Isabel is fighting her own inner demons.<br /><br />Cole was my hero in this one. I absolutely adore him as a character and I can't imagine having read this series without him. When I first \\"met\\" him in this series, I thought he was cocky and arrogant and a TOTAL jerk. By the end, he was still all those things, but he has the hugest heart. Even if he does realize it. And you've got to hand it to him for his determination and way of figuring out the impossible.<br /><br />I love Sam and Grace and Isabel. They all are completely different than they were when the series started, and yet... they're the same. Isabel's icy shell gets chipped away and you see the broken person she is with a heart of gold she doesn't want anyone to see. And won't admit she has. Sam is tired of letting fear rule his life and so he faces it head on and prevails. All the while never waivering in his love and loyalty for Grace. And Grace, just as steadfast and strong as ever. Even in her weaknesses.<br /><br />But Cole... Cole was my favorite. And not just because when I was reading his parts I was reading them with Dan Bittner's voice ::sigh::, but because he was just amazing.<br /><br />This is now one of my favorite series of all time. Without a doubt. If you haven't read any of The Wolves of Mercy Falls books, you should. Maggie is an amazing author and I'm so glad to have read the series. I can not tell you how much I loved this book.to have read the series. I can not tell you how much I loved this book.

B005FITIIC|5.0|This movie is very topical right now after the financial crash of 2008.  Wonder which company they're depicting? It's completely obvious if you've read anything at all about the financial meltdown.  If you want to know how regular folks get screwed by financial companies in a quick two hours, check out this flick.  Some of the jargon may be a bit confusing if you don't know much about financial instruments, but it really doesn't matter ... it'll be pretty clear what's going on pretty quickly.  The film can be a bit heavy-handed with obvious contrasts at times (the dying dog for example), but the acting was excellent.  Zachary Quinto was outstanding although this is really more of an ensemble cast movie not so much a movie with a lead actor as one can probably tell from the description. Demi Moore looks incredible for her age and as for Jeremy Irons, he did a wonderful job as the rapacious company CEO.
B006ZBRMOU|1.0|I'm going to be honest. I wasn't expecting much going into this book. I skimmed the fanfic of the first two and even though it wasn't impressive or orginial in any way whatsoever, for some reason I purchased Freed.<br />Anastasia is probably one of the most annoying, underdeveloped, and disgustingly repetitive characters I've ever read. If I had $1 for every repeated thought or every time I read \\"holy (fill in the blank)!\\" I could probably buy that Chanel bag I've had my eye on.<br />Every conversation/disagreement Ana and Christian have are about THE EXACT SAME THING - redundant.<br />Any little joke between the couple is (again) repeated over and over. Ex: \\"Fair point well made, as ever, Miss. Steele/Mrs. Grey\\". Let me roll my times at how many times I've read that in the three books.<br />Ugh, I'm getting repetitive just writing about it...because it's SO REPETITIVE.<br />(And I haven't even mentioned Ana's \\"goddess\\" and \\"subconscious\\" or how much people seem to blush/\\"flush\\" in the Fifty Shades books...do so many every day people really blush that much?)<br /><br />I get why people like this book. Lots of ladies love an alpha male. That's why books like this or Jamie McGuire's Beautiful Disaster are so popular. But to me, Christian is a pain in the butt. And a complete contradiction. He's supposed to be the master of an insane empire (btw, when exactly does he work at said empire? He seems to do a whole lotta nothin'), yet he seems to lack common sense. I like the psychology of how his early life trauma shaping him into the person he is. But I just do not get the attraction between the two, felt no chemistry. (In fact [spoiler alert]: There's a part in the 2nd book, if I remember correctly, where Christian is in Ana's apartment with an ex-sub and Ana witnesses the ex-sub's reaction to Christian. I felt there was more chemistry in that tiny scene between the ex and Christian than in three books put together with Christian and Ana)<br /><br />I feel like I've read the same story tons of times. All I was left feeling at the end of the series was utter annoyance at the whole of it.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll get a lot of hate for this review, but I'm just sharing my thoughts with no intention of hurting anyones feelings. the Fifty Shades series just wasn't for me. (Not to mention it's pretty expensive for something that's also available on the internet for free).<br /><br />After thought - Can I also mention how much I dislike Kate? Because I do. I really do.the same story tons of times.

0374275637|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell's best-selling \\"Blink\\" is facing an onslaught of books that scream out, \\"HOLD ON\\" ...before your rush to judgment. Making a judgment in a `blink' may be dangerous. In the latest challenge to Gladwell, Nobel laureate and psychologist, Daniel Kahneman's, \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow,\\" illusions and assumptions are front and center, with the author showing how these interfere with judgment.<br /><br />Kahneman was awarded the 2002 Nobel Memorial Prize in Economics for his work in prospect theory. In 2011, he was named by Foreign Policy magazine to its list of top global thinkers. Currently, he is professor emeritus of psychology and public affairs at Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School.<br /><br />Kahneman illustrates the role of fast and slow thinking. Most of the time we think fast since most of the time we are experts at what we are thinking about, and most of the time we do make the right judgment with very little effort. However, the suggestion that we should take more time (slow thinking) does kick in from time to time and most of us avoid it, as it is very hard work. When fast thinking provides a suggestion and slow thinking does not block it, we are vulnerable to mistakes.<br /><br />Our mind is an association machine and false judgments are reached due to assumptions and illusions - based on associations from the past learned experiences - that go unchecked. Kahnemann illustrates this with the \\"illusion of validity\\" (the false belief in the reliability of our own judgment), the \\"availability bias\\" (a biased judgment based on memories that are more easily available) and the endowment effect\\" (the tendency to value something more highly when we own it than when someone else owns it).<br /><br />In another book I recently read, \\"Mistakes Were Made (but not by me),\\" authors Carol Tavris and Elliot Aronson track \\"self-justification through the territories of family, memory, therapy, law, prejudice, conflict, and war\\" highlighting the difficulties of managing dissonance and its role in helping us to preserve our beliefs, confidence, self-esteem, and well being...but at big cost to how we judge and make decisions.<br /><br />Books like \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" and \\"Mistakes Were Made\\" are provocative and instructive. None of us our perfect...in how we view things. All of us are blind and are subject to error. These authors show the root cause of our error and give pause for us...to rethink how we and others think and judge...and blink.in helping us to preserve our beliefs, confidence, self-esteem, and well being...but at big cost to how we judge and make decisions.

B006Y5BWQG|3.0|I had no expectations for this at all.  I mean, granted, I love musicals but even with what looked like a great cast and stellar production team, I just was very meh.<br /><br />And here I am two days later, having watched it twice, finding myself humming the songs from the show.  Not the songs we know - the NEW songs in the show.<br /><br />I think that's pretty special, don't you?<br /><br />I can't wait for the rest of the season.  I sort of hope that it's written as a show with a built in end date.  After all, the show has to open eventually, right?  And I can't see it going beyond that.  Ideally, I would love to see one stellar year.  Like a long mini series kind of thing.  And avoid the travesty that Glee has become.<br /><br />Edited to add - Sigh.  Should have known they couldn't keep it up.  I stand by the pilot being fabulous, but even two episodes in, I'm seeing cliches and clunky writing and forced drama; crap.<br /><br />I mean, why isn't Karen dying of gratitude to be even in the ensemble of this production?  If her resume is so \\"light\\" she is very much LUCKY to get even that!  And speaking of light resumes, how in the world does she have an agent and yet not know her resume is light?  How did she get that agent?  How did she get that audition??  Anyway...sadness.

B004A8ZWW4|5.0|I really liked this movie and I admit I was skeptical.  I watched this with my 3 year old who was so excited about the robot fighting.  Now there is some swearing but no nudity (or real romance) and since it was robots fighting I thought it was less than real-life fighting.  I don't let my kids watch actual boxing but this movie was more fun since it was robots and left us rooting for \\"Atom.\\"<br /><br />The movie starts out with Hugh Jackman's character basically being a dead-beat dad to a kid he never met.  He of course falls for the kid and they become a great team.  The movie has you rooting for the underdog and getting mad at the bad guys.  The kid is inspiring and the movie is actually one I could watch a few more times!  My husband liked it because it reminded him of Rocky!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so fun and challenging.  love the daily bonus. would recommend to all of my best friends. thanks for the good times.  some of the games are pretty cheesey but still fun.

B000JMLKCG|5.0|just finished thomas hardy's \\"mayor of casterbridge,\\" a book which i highly recommend.<br /><br />this novel is purported to be the first thriller, from which all that followed are copies.<br /><br />the characters in this metaphorical masterpiece operate in a never dissipating cloud of pathos which hangs over them like a vulture over a wounded fawn.  the last sentence of the book illustrates: happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.<br /><br />once you pick up the rhythm of the writing, you will not be able to put the book down.
B000SJ9N1K|5.0|Item was exactly as described, a blessing since it was used and old. Shipped on time and was very pleased overall.
B002MQYOFW|3.0|So everyone I know who is a reader was reading or has read this book.  I decided to give it a try on my new Kindle (that I love by the way).  I don't like scary movies and I don't read sci-fi but i was curious.  I do have to admit...I wanted to know how it ended but it was pretty violent and graphic.  I am glad I read it but I am not in any rush to read about the end of humanity as we know it.  It is just too much of a downer for me.  Kids killing kids because they are forced to by the goverment.  I get the BIG picture but choose to ignore it.  Real life is tough enough for so many and this just was too weird for me and too depressing.  I will leave the other 2 books for the big sci-fi folks.  I do have to say however that I could picture everything that Ms. Collins was writing about and I think that was half the problem for me.Thanks.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its an awesome app and with this app you wont have to download a bunch of others, and its free !
B005LAJ1H2|5.0|I purchased for my son as a gift.  He loves Boardwalk Empire and is enjoying it.  This has a price guarantee as it was a pre-order, and the price dropped before it was shipped and I was only charged the lower price! My only complaint was not about the product, but I am pretty certain I said this was a gift, but my son did get the price included in his packing slip.
B000MV9026|5.0|Am a mother of a 10mth old and 2yr old. My kids love this movie it is very educative and interactive. Whenever we re driving my kids love watching it .will highly recommend it to any parent. Can't wait to get the part 2 for my kids.
B003ES5ZPK|1.0|I originally bought this item for a desktop monitor that I sometimes use to work on other systems and wanted to make it easier to switch out the HDMI cable on my ASUS VE249H monitor. I originally bought a similar adapter that had a 90 degree bend from a local electronics store but paid $18 for it and saw this and figured I would give it a go and return the other and save the money. What a waste of shipping and time. I have gone through 2 of these and had to return them both. The first failed to even deliver a signal to the monitor and the 2nd would connect but only if the angle of the adapter was just right. Move the monitor at all and you would either completely lose the signal or the screen would artifact. Such a great idea for a product but such poor execution... not to mention build around the swivel feels very flimsy. I absolutely DO NOT recommend this item ... but thanks to Amazon for making the return process simple and fast.
B002L6I9Z4|5.0|\\"Santa\\" brought this for Christmas for our almost 3-year old daughter, and she absolutely loves it.  The pictures are much better than I expected given the price, and it seems pretty durable.  Rechargeable battery lasts for a lot more pictures than I would have expected too.  For a toy, it's great!
0439813786|5.0|This book won the Caldecott Medal for Children's Literature. The award is given for the pictures in the book. It highlights the effects of the pictures as relates to the story.  This book is not the normal \\"picture\\" book. It is a new creative way to tell a fiction story.  I tell my kids at the library that they must \\"read\\" the pictures in order to understand the story.  The Oscar nominated film of this book does the same by having silence during many of the scenes. Highly recommended .
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I used this app on my Aneroid phone and now on the Kindle Fire. I love the variety of versions and reading plans, plus the &quot;catch me up&quot; feature if you fall behind. You can set reading reminders, and youversion emails periodically with encouragement and tips. BUT the app does run constantly on your device (why, people?) and you must have wi-fi for most versions (there are a few that can be downloaded for when you are offline).  For me, the convenience and ease-of-use outweigh the drawbacks.
B0006284JQ|5.0|I love this version because it comes with a bonus CD with 5 remixes. Also, I really love the packaging on this version. It matches my DVD!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|It's not much different than my PC's MahJong game that's came with Windows XP (and before) except that on my PC, I can see the tiles. You can't change the view from portrait to landscape, and when you expand the view by flicking the screen, some of the tiles go off the \\"page.\\" This game needs to be played in landscape mode (lengthwise).
B0058VW36U|5.0|fun, entertaining,  and one of the best games on my kindle fire. cute plot and it is good for wasting time.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|I got this case because there were none at the stores in my town and I thought this one looked good. It works great and has a very nice design. The only thing about it is that is started to peel material off. Its kind of weird. I like this case and would recommend it, but I honestly think that 30 dollars was atop off!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|best game ever. I love it plus I want the. coins from rating this but it is still awesome.I lobe tjidm game.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|I watched this video at the urging of my 13-yr-old granddaughter who declared it her \\"favorite movie of all time\\".  I watched it twice and several times since ---with other adults---and it is now one of my favorite movies of all time.  It's charming and touching, funny and sad, and the actors are irresistable!  It is truly a cult classic.  Incidentally, I've seen numerous stage and film versions of \\"Peter Pan\\" ---including Mary Martin's Broadway blockbuster---and this is truly the best.
B005LAIGFU|5.0|I actually watched it three times in a week.<br /><br />Tilda Swinton as the mother and Ezra Miller as Kevin were absolutely fantastic!! John C. Reilly as the naive father is just ok.<br /><br />The movie is about the aftermath of Kevin's killing rampage at his high school. The past is interwoven with the present as the mother thinks back on her life and relationship with Kevin. That sentence makes it seem boring but it is anything but. This movie had me on the edge of my seat, all three times that I saw it.<br /><br />Excellent, chilling, disturbing, haunting, powerful.<br /><br />Co-editors of \\"First Year University: A Survival Guide\\"
0446547654|1.0|I'm so glad I borrowed this book from a friend and didn't actually pay money for it. What a waste of a few hours of my life!  The plot is age old: Boy meets Girl in High School. Boy is from the Wrong Side of the Tracks. Girl is from a Wealthy and Important Family. Boy and Girl Fall in Love and Don't Care About Their Families. Boy and Girl end up going their separate ways, then reconnect many years later amidst a sea of angst, what ifs, could haves, never forgot yous, etc. \\"Chaos\\" - and I use that term loosely in context with this book of drivel - then ensues.  Throw in some truly terrible stereotypical secondary characters, wooden writing, and one of those nice, neat endings that wraps up every tiny detail in the book, leaving the main character nicely tied up for life, and you have a recipe for disaster. Which is exactly what this book is. Boring, droll, practically screaming for attention, and an ending that will leave you wondering whether Sparks even gave a crap about this book while writing it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Never had a problem,it just plays and plays and plays... Looking for a great game here it is! Download it today!
B0063IH60K|5.0|only thing I don't like is adds between games and too few background options....but hey its free....otherwise I really like the deal options
B004UID2LC|1.0|so I didn't download this but... isn't this pirating?  it just sounds like piracy to me q w e r t y
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|Hours of time wasted, but in that entertained and fun kind of way. Love it even more with the update and more levels!
159420229X|4.0|Wow, what a wonderful and surprising journey this author took!  Talking about another world filled with strange creatures and experiences, almost like into the mind of Lewis Carroll, in Wonderland, where bizzare creatures and foreign words are hidden ready to pop out any time.  (fanstastic bookcover too) It is so adventurous, and I really want to praise the author's endeavor and commitment and his ability to share his experience in such an entertaining and meaningful way.  I really enjoyed this book and will definitely put it in a special room in my mental palace to remember.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|im an old head, one of the guys bitching about music of today and how bad it is.. being a huge dylan fan i couldnt wait to hear these recordings as i know a lot of people who wont listen to dylan because they dont like his voice. this record shows what a great songwriter he is,, artists from Patti Smith to Miley Cyrus??? sound great due to the fact that these songs are so great, im hoping it turns on a whole new generation of dylan fans, I can't believe how good miley cyrus sounds on \\"you're gonna make me lonesome\\" Adele on \\"to make you feel my love\\" and diana krall on \\"simple twist of fate\\" other highlights are joe perry \\"man of peace\\" thea gilmore \\"ill remeber you\\" and of course johnny cash/avett bros. \\"one too many mornings\\",, great stuff & highly recommended..
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love playing these games wish I didn't have to pay points to unlock them but they're still fun !! I like the one where the guy jumps off the building and u have to pull the parachute and go through the rings lol it made me realize I should read the directions.
0385344325|1.0|I read one other Jack Reacher novel and was not thrilled.  This one put the icing on the cake.  It took me forever to get through.  There was too much violence.  That seems to be Jack's go to solution.  With four murders by the end of the book, I don't know what to expect once he no longer has the discipline of the military in his life.  I'm done with Reacher.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The most descriptive out of all of the books and makes you want to yell at the book sometimes. I think Susan wrapped up the trilogy greatly with this awesome book.

1400064287|5.0|I bought this book given the great reviews people gave to it and, after reading it, I would add myself to this group.  The book offers simple yet relevant advice for anybody wanting to improve his/her communication skills.  Looking forward to reading other books by the authors!

B0068TL23G|1.0|No game app, what so ever, deserves any stars if you can not move it to the memory card. Period...
030726999X|5.0|I am so grateful to Amazon that this book was available to buy.  The seller offered it as used, and true to the sellers review, the used book arrived in very good condition, and I was at last able to read the third book in an extraordinary series written by the author.  I wish the story could continue, so fascinating, well written and filled with intrigue was this series.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought this book was awesome. It kept you involved and wanting to read more.I think it completed the series perfectly.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|This show kicks a**. Bought the first season so I can watch it any time I need survival tips. Now I can watch it anytime! I love this show!

B0062NAX1U|5.0|My family and I watched this movie this evening and we all enjoyed it. My kids thought it was just great, and my wife and I found it to be inspiring. You can't walk away from a Kendrick movie without feeling inspired to try to be a better person.  There are nail-biting action scenes. There are laugh-out-loud scenes. There are tragic scenes. And a great message throughout - about fathers accepting the responsibility to be better fathers, and to be men of courage, and to lead their families with a faith in God.  If you've liked any of the other Kendrick movies, you're going to like this one - guaranteed. Courageous is as good or better than Facing the Giants.  Alas, many atheists will despise this movie, because many atheists are intolerant of religion - even though atheism is a religion itself, based on faith and faith alone. So, don't let reviews by atheists - especially those who haven't actually watched the movie - influence you.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Honestly, the best book I have read in years. Less than a hundred pages in and I was hooked and could not stop flipping the page. It's full of everything you want in a book- mystery, rivalry, a bit of fantasy, deceit, twists, lovable characters and suspense. This is one amazing read.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|fun and entertaining time killer that never gets boring i love it i almost cant play it bofore people try to steal my opossum away
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I would recommend this app to a lot o people! 117 games that you never get bored!!!! I love it!!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|Good game. Quick practice for competitions, runs well on my Kindle fire. Nice graphics. I like playing spider on my Kindle!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Easy to play! A fun way to spend five minutes!  I would recommend this for any Kindle User, Excellent game play!
B005QMOZOO|2.0|Skipped quite a number of pages due to the relentless rehashing of Pride and Prejudice. I must remember to order a sample first before purchasing books. A very disappointing read!
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I thought long and hard about spending $40 to cover a $200 Fire. Well it was worth it. Fits perfectly, protects the Fire and looks great on top of it all.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|When St. Anger was released back in 2003, fans disapproved of either Metallica's new sound or the CD's poor production. Five years later, Death Magnetic is released, and truthfully it's much better than St. Anger (which wasn't really that bad to start with). The long guitar solos are extraordinary and supremely exciting. The band is, as always, outstanding from beginning to end. The songs are impressive. \\"The End of the Line,\\" \\"Broken, Beat, & Scarred,\\" and \\"All Nightmare Long\\" are magnificent. The hit single \\"The Day that Never Comes\\" is excellent, while \\"The Unforgiven III\\" is really nice (even if it doesn't exactly overshadow the first two \\"Unforgiven\\"'s). \\"The Judas's Kiss\\" and the instrumental \\"Suicide & Redemption\\" should make the most avid fans rejoice in the midst of mainstream pop that's dominating radio.<br /><br />It's true that Death Magnetic isn't as good as Ride the Lightning and The Black Album, but it stands on its own. It's a wonderful album from Metallica.<br /><br />Grade: 9.4 out of 10<br /><br />Also from Metallica<br />Ride the Lightning (9.8 out of 10)<br />Master of Puppets (8 out of 10)<br />...And Justice for All (9.7 out of 10)<br />The Black Album (9.8 out of 10)<br />Load (9.3 out of 10)<br />ReLoad (9.1 out of 10)<br />S&M, Live (10 out of 10)<br />St. Anger (7.5 out of 10)
B000QUEQBS|5.0|I enjoyed this and found it believable for the most part good flick, top 5 sniper movie I have seen
0439023491|5.0|Great book! Better than the first! I feel that the story line is a little redundant, but hey, the author made it work.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Excellent Movie kept you engaged.  Everything was real, acting very good.  Enjoyed the landscape and real life settings not fake.  We need more movies that entertain then the continued can't possibly be real and could never happen shows
B000FA5TTW|5.0|God was this book depressing. Very well written, but depressing! Overall, I'd buy it again, but don't read it if you're in a comedy-type mood.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Excellent sound!  No Install Problems with software (Win7).  Voice Morphing has been fun on Team Speak.  Very comfortable on my head, lightweight, and no pressure on my ears due to the cup design.  Interfaces with Itunes using G-Keys on the left side, no issues.  You can customize functions and have them work other programs like Media Player too if you like.  I wish they had a cool stand to hang them on...but hey, I like them so much, I'm gonna build my own stand for them.  They ROCK!
0439023513|4.0|OK, so I am a HUGE fan of this trilogy. The beginning of the book was fantastic. The ending, however, was such a royal disappointment. I couldn't help but feel that the author rushed the ending... like she had a doctor's appointment to go to or something. Other than the last 30 pages, the book was great, but the ending made the entire series flop.
0061353248|5.0|What started as a business read very quickly became an understanding of customers, family and friends alike. Dan Ariely's writing style is conversational in nature - witty at times - but always keeping you from putting the book down. A must read for marketers and direct marketers of every ilk.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was fantastic. Hands down one of the most unique books I have ever read. Almost like a mixture between Twilight and the Lord of the Flies.
B00447G29S|4.0|A great Blu-ray 3-D title. Absolutely loved by the kids for whom it was purchased. An old movie, but has repeat value due to some decent 3-D effects thrown in.
B003Y5H4YI|1.0|What is wrong with the blu ray manufacturers?  Is there a plot to make these things as unfriendly to watch as possible?  After the downloading of trailers and all the irrelevant nonsense you are so tired you don't want to watch anything. Bring back VHS!!!
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Great movie, combines a good old fashion under-dog with a lot of heart along with a good father and son finding themselves and each other.  Highly recommend, easily one of the best movies made this year
0451232577|3.0|Follett tells the history of WW I almost entirely through conversations between the characters.  I thought there would be more action.  Also, some of the characters showing up at the same place on the battlefields in France or at the Russian front was just too contrived a plot device.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I love this cover!  It is so much nicer than the plain covers.  The script writing on the cover adds detail & interest.  The red color is very pretty.  The cover is rigid enough to stand the Kindle in landscape fashion which makes typing easier for email & internet use.  I have recently traveled with this item & the cover protected my Kindle Fire & proved very durable.
B006PZBR8S|4.0|Okay, I'm not too good with reviews, but Amazon doesn't allow one to just rate the film (Oh, please Amazon, make that happen like Netflix and IMDb do. Please!) - we have to write something about it, too.<br /><br />I, frankly, didn't care for the apparent stupidity of Charlie Kenton (Hugh Jackman) in the beginning, and honestly throughout much of this film.  The acting was good, it's just Charlie was a stupid, selfish, inconsiderate, stubborn, self-absorbed ex-boxer who couldn't make it.  It's no wonder to me he was such a loser in the ring - he certainly didn't know how to handle anything in real life.<br /><br />What really helps Charlie though, is Max, his long abandon son.  One could (should actually!) say Charlie has all the brawn and Max all the smarts.  Max, at 11, is like three times smarter than his dad - must of that he had to have gotten from his mother!  Okay, so I'm being a little to hard on Charlie, but I've seen plenty of dead beat parents in my life, so much so that even watching such a character is almost annoying for me.  Fortunately, Charlie does smarten up. Mostly because his son is modeling very intelligent behavior for such a young one.  Of course, for anyone, it doesn't really matter where our lessons come from; what is important is learning to where we actually change our behavior.  Charlie finally gets it in the last third of the film!<br /><br />This is one of those films where the child is more the parent because the adult is too busy making his own noise in the world.  Still, the bot fights and the education that Charlie goes through at the hands of Max was very entertaining, especially where Max sticks to his convictions and never wavers on what he thinks is best for himself, his family, and Charlie.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|when I first got the game I thought that it was nice. when I had played the games it was really hard. other than that it was very good
B0058VW36U|5.0|Cut the Rope is an adorable game!!!!!! The Om-Nom is really cute and the levels are fun and entertaining. Highly recommended for all ages!
B005NF2UE6|4.0|Not as good as Darkhorse, but any nickelback fan will still enjoy. We must stand together and lullabye, lead this cd in my opinion. All in all, another very good Blum from a great band.
B004JZBGWI|1.0|horrible don't try it it was so weird and really confusing don't use it it is different but different isn't always good
B0063IH60K|5.0|With very minimal ads and terrific graphics, this game is an excellent choice for all of your solitaire playing needs.
B005COO1X6|3.0|It was okay. I didn't like it as much as other Stephen King stuff.  I think it's a talented piece of work. It has several characters--a kid that's hanging around a place that people trespass all the time, and people near his area that get sucked into a car. The car eats people--totally a Stephen King thing.  It's okay, like I said. Also at the end, there's a preview of \\"11/22/63\\" which is also a good read.  Read it if you like Stephen King's suspense stuff. I like his books like \\"Pet Sematary\\" and \\"Thinner\\" but his newer books are all right too. I wish he'd go back to scarier stuff; he does more of suspense and gentler genres now.
B0036V4DGC|5.0|What can I say, It's the Alan Parsons Project.  What a venue.  It Must have been amazing to be there.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is great for the kids in the car or at home.  we get the whole family involved its a new family gun night game
B005OC5CLQ|5.0|CAD is country of the more traditionel kind with a modern twist. It kind of reminds of the type of country from the 90 th. CAD is my best buy in a long time. All the songs are relatable because they reflect life. Scotty´s voice is powerful and soothing at the same time and his emotions connect with our hearts and feelings.  And even if some songs make you cry, the overall touch is positive and this CD leaves you in a good mood. It  makes you feel good. I can´t stop playing it, and the more I listen to it, the more I love it.
B005HSL626|5.0|I love this app my high score of 500 exactly. Recommend to everyone out there. They should make a second one with more fruits or something. I don't like all the ads though. Other than that... ENJOY!!!!!#
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This is a cover for the Kindle that has the look and feel of a beautiful old leather book.  It fits the Kindle perfectly, is light weight, and just looks very classy.  I am completely happy with this Verso choice.
B005QF0GIK|5.0|It's all that. \\"Weather\\" is an essential release for esoteric memories. While rhythm is almost non-existent, Meshelle skirts the direct urbane influence for rhythmic dissonance. At oncepron. It becomes one of Mesgphekkkk strikes.
B0068TL23G|5.0|This game works great on my kindle and has been super fun to play. Took me about 10 minutes to finish the first chapter and am now going back for more! Best free app of the day yet!
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Terrence Malick's most accessible mini-masterpiece. Looking back at the rigid 50s, it was interesting to see how life was depicted. It was a period of conformity. It was also a period of racial segregation and 4th Generation of Jim Crow laws. Some have a habit of idealizing that period. But it was not the best of times for a lot of people. There in a Texas neighborhood that was segregated was a snapshot of the divisiness. Still, it was America working towards our better selves. The forthcoming Civil Rights, women's and gay liberation movements would forever alter the landscape of these United States.
B0063IH60K|4.0|i like this solitaire game very much.  easy to move cards. fast, has  not given any problems so far. great game.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great weather app. I can select a number of diffent locations and keep up with their weather. See a 15 day forecast, as well as, an hour by hour forecast. There is also a great satellite picture of the desired area.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|this game is really off the hook and if you somehow haven't gotten angry birds yet u should it is really fun and a good way to kill some hours
B0044RUSZM|4.0|Well this item instantly solved my overheating problem, and arms seem to be sturdy and support a lot of weight.  However they do keep slipping out of the acrylic piece that makes the front bar, but they have never fallen over.  Still it is very annoying that the whole thing doesn't stay together better.  All in All, there is no better alternative that you don't have to just make yourself.
B004FOA84A|4.0|works great on kindle fire.  hopefully the creators make another one that is longer with trickier puzzles. nice looking images and easy control and all puzzles are logical.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Works as described, ready to set up and use. I can help my wife while I'm at work.c Check the progress of downloads while watching a movie.
B0061TQBRK|5.0|Lacuna Coil is freakin' awesome.  Now that I've stated the obvious, I'll list my opinion of each song:  1) Trip the Darkness  Excellent choice for the first single. It's dark, it's heavy, it's catchy, and it's worthy of being put on repeat.  2) Against You  The guitars during the verses and the solos are sweet! Cristina and Andrea's voices sound awesome together during the chorus. (Then again, they always sound awesome together)  3) Kill the Light  I can totally see this song as a single. Love the beat during the verses.  4) Give Me Something More  The chorus sticks out to me the most. Pretty good song.  5) Upsidedown  I found myself headbanging to the riff in between the verses; reminds me of the riff in 'Fragile' from Karmacode. I also love the lyrics. One of my favorites.  6) End of Time  Different from the rest but still worth a listen. Nothing negative here.  7) I Don't Believe in Tomorrow  So...I basically love everything about this song. I especially love the guitar riff that starts at 2:57; I was DEFINITELY headbanging to that. This is by far my #1 favorite.  8) Intoxicated  Another one of my favorites. Once again, the riff in between the verses is kickass.  9) The Army Inside  This song rocks! Be prepared for another awesome guitar solo.  10) Losing My Religion  I'm not sure which I like better...the original R.E.M. song or the \\"Coil-ized\\" version. They definitely did it justice here.  11) Fire  Catchy and heavy. That's all it needs to be good.  12) My Spirit  Love the lyrics. Love the music. LOVE THIS BAND!!!  My Top 5 Favorites:  5) Against You  4) Upsidedown  3) Trip the Darkness  2) Intoxicated  1) I Don't Believe in Tomorrow  I highly suggest everyone gets a high dosage of Dark Adrenaline. Side effects include headbanging, putting songs on repeat and at full volume, singing songs in public, and not wanting to listen to anything else. At least...those are the effects it had on me!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a great book for anyone who has lost interest in reading. I have suggested this book to several friends that have stopped reading and they are now passionate readers again. This book is fun and engaging. You really get swept up in this other world.  Warning: be prepared to fall in love with Peeta.
B0055SWM08|4.0|I wasn't sure I would like this game but it definetly is a fun and challenging game. it is a nice change from all the food and picture find games I have to pass the time with.
B003TJR2HS|3.0|I bought this for use with an iPhone 4S and a Lifeproof case. The dockStubz fits into the case no problem, but the backside has a protruding step which interferes with the Lifeproof hinged cover. It can still be used, but the dockStubz applies pressure to the hinged cover causing the two halves of the case to separate slightly. And when the dockStubz is fully seated into the phone the pressure causes it to be at a slight angle. Imagine opening the hinged cover to its stop and continuing to apply pressure on it so the case begins to separate - that's what the dockStubz is doing. It doesn't seem like it will be a problem, but I am concerned the hinge of the cover will wear prematurely due to the pressure which it is obviously not designed for.<br /><br />I think for occasional use it would be fine, but for daily extended use it may cause some warping of the case or failure of the hinge. If the dockStubz was designed with the protruding side in front this problem could be eliminated. So while the product works and probably perfectly with any other case, with the Lifeproof the fit is not perfect and you will notice this every time you insert the dockStubz. I will be returning it and trying the RadTech which also has a thicker bottom, but the backside step is smaller since it is symmetric with steps both front and rear. Looking at the Lifeproof case I can see that any adapter is going to apply some pressure on the open cover, it's just a matter of how much and the RadTech should apply less.<br /><br />Overall it seems to be a great product, but for specific use with the Lifeproof case it's not perfect.<br /><br />Edit: I have since received the RadTech and it does indeed fit better but does still apply slight pressure on the case.  I also found that the dockStubz has a key feature that the RadTech does not - a charge converter that will allow charging of the iPhone when connected to older FireWire cords (my car has one connected to the radio).  This may not be applicableinfo to most, but was important enough for me (charging while playing music) that I have reordered the dockStubz and use it piggy-back with the RadTech.

B0052VUNHC|1.0|OK - I finally gave into Amazon.com's suggestions and purchased \\"Beautiful Disaster\\" for my Kindle.  Mind you this was in-between Fifty shades Darker and the release of Fifty Shades Freed - and I was desperate for more of the same ... yet this is not it.  If you like a PG-13 read set in a world of immature 18 year old kids -- this is your book.  If you are looking for 'This could happen to me'... knock your socks off, sex and lust, *can't put this book down* read - then pass this one up.  The EL James books were riveting.  The walls could have come down around me... yet I would not have noticed... I was bewitched by the characters and true to life scenarios that played out... raptured by the sex scenes and haunted by the love.  I kept waiting for Beautiful Disaster to grab me by the waist and throw me on the bed the way the EL James books did - but it NEVER happened.  Just utter disappointment and completely ridiculous scenarios that could never happen in the real world.  This book was such a crushing disappointment after having had a brush with Fifty Shades of bliss.

1594202710|4.0|\\"On China\\" offers an interesting arrival point for the greatest proponent of realism, positing that the depth of economic interdependence may alter conventional realist imperatives in a shifting balance of power. While you may agree or disagree with Kissinger's conclusions, this book draws on the expert's insight and understanding of Chinese culture and politics to inform the debate. I found it extremely educative, and think it is a critical read for anyone interested in the future of Chinese-US relations or following the current Administration's smart-power reiteration of the US as a Pacific Power.

0439023521|5.0|I barely put the book down the entire time I was reading it.  It starts off very well.  I fell in love with Katniss from the beginning but when she volunteered to take Prim's place, I felt every emotion going through her.  Peeta was a little bit more difficult to love in the beginning because I wanted it to be Gale she went into the games with.  Mad he didn't actually say I love you to her before she left but I don't think Peeta would have captured any of her affection if Gale had.  Then the games...Wow.  I was glue to the book much of the way through those.  The book leaft me wanting to read the next one.  I can't wait!  Very good read and captures you from the very beginning.  Thank you so much Ms. Collins!

B005IUB4RU|2.0|I love Alcatrazz with Malsteam or Vai, but his 2011 release is a big disappointment.  Disk 1 is the same as the original release except the last song was reduced by 2 minutes.  It got cut off during Vai's solo.  All songs on disk 2 are bootlegged quality.  It sounds like the record company just copied these songs from the live video concert.  Poor Job.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|Can't fathom the negative reviews.  73 songs, $19 bucks, good cause.  There may be some bad versions in the 73 (topped by a bluegrass version of \\"Senor\\" that turns an existential masterpiece into something that sounds like you're just pulling off the road to ask some guy in a gas station for directions) but there are some good ones too (sweet version of New Morning captures its essence with much better vocals), and most listeners will wind up with different lists. I even liked Miley Cyrus's contribution which seems to put me in a minority among reviewers.  But unless a reviewer is some kind of saint who is doing good for lots of people, i think this is not the item to display one's Dylanphilic credentials.
B005X7HA6C|3.0|\\"When Mr. Murase and I were in prison together we made a pact over sak&eacute;.\\" After the head of a Yakuza family learns of his henchman's betrayal to a drug dealing family he starts a war that changes everything. This is a very good movie that is equal parts tense, bloody and dramatic. The only problem is that the flow seems off. Going from scenes of murder and finger cutting to long sequences of nothing happening makes it hard to get fully engrossed. On the other hand it is also a movie that forces you to keep watching in order to find out which family will ultimately win out. I did enjoy this but this is not a movie for everyone. A movie with no real good guy and leaves you watching not sure who to root for. I like movies like that. Overall, a good but slow movie that is almost an updated Japanese Godfather. I give it a B.
B0064NTZQ2|4.0|Drive is a very cool crime drama (not an action movie) with an old-school 1970s or -80s sense of style and timing.  It has a slow fuse, letting you hang out with the characters for a while, and then explodes into a rampage of ultraviolence.  Good stuff.

0525478817|5.0|I read this book within 24 hours. It's beautifully written and I especially liked the way the protagonists were able to voice their opinions on life, love and death so intelligibly. It's hard to not feel empathy for them and I cried and laughed with them. It is true what critics say that \\"John Green writes for youth, not to youth\\". He helps them to form a voice. John Green manages to give us a silver lining on an otherwise depressing topic; cancer.

B000OPOAM0|4.0|As already described by another reviewer, this movie isen't logical and that is the main issue that I have with it.  The entire movie is built around the idea that in the future A.I. will challenge the human race and try to wipe it out. In the movie A.I. and robots take control of the USA's nuclear weapons and uses them to start a nuclear war with the Soviet Union, remember the movie was originally released in 1984, when the Cold War was still around. The mission of A.I. is to get rid off the human race entirely, so that it can reign supreme and unchallenged in the future. Now just hold that thought for a second or two. If it was the mission of A.I. to wipe out the human race, then it could have been accomplished fairly easily by using the nuclear arsenal of the USA to destroy the world. After all, the USA's arsenal back in 1984 had an overkill capacity to destroy the entire human population of earth many times over. So why would A.I. just target the Soviet Union to start a nuclear war, why not target the rest of the world population? That is the crucial question that this movie never answers, for the simply reason that it can't answer it, without conceeding that its simply not logical for A.I. to not target the rest of humanity with its overkill capacity once it has control over Skynet (the computer system that controls the nuclear arsenal of the USA)! The entire story line thus becomes redundant. Why sent a terminator through time to kill the leader of the future resistance movement of humanity, if he or rather his mother could have been killed via nuclear weapons, even earlier.  Of course, we all know that if A.I. had actually used its intelligence (lol) then there wouldn't have been any need for a terminator to be sent back in time to kill whoever. And that would mean that the movie would have been about 5 minutes long, lol... That was of course unacceptable to the producers of this movie. I am surprised that apparently only one reviewer actually realized just how illogical the whole plot of the movie is. Actually, its so illogical that one could drive trucks through the flawed story line!  Nevertheless, the movie itself is great. The acting is solid; there's lots of action in it, and if you can actually forget the illogical character of the movie, you can actually enjoy it. But for the illogical part, I just had to rate the movie down accordingly.  Anyways, a very good one if you don't think about the massive flaws in the plot of the movie.
B00000ILDF|2.0|This is what happens when you let an actor/actress co-produce. Throw in a script that jumps all over the place, a plot that is muddled, leave the Alien almost completely out, and you have Alien 3. First of all, killing off Newt and Hicks was a mistake, but if they wanted to go that route it could have been handled much better. The threat of the Alien/dog hybrid is silly and non-existent in this film. The Alien shows up sporadically and Bwah! Dead random prisoner. Also, the rape scene with the generic industrial metal music was way out of place, as is Charles S. Dutton's character. He hates Ripley, he defends Ripley, he hates her again. Much like religion, he is a contradiction. The movie uses poor cgi, lame ass dialogue, and lots of bald guys to create the disaster-piece that killed off any hope of this franchise being respected beyond the first two. Same thing Predator 2 did, destroy any chance of making solid future films. Personally, I feel after 2 Ripley should have gone off in the sunset. Away with the female lead crap and lets get Hicks, Newt, and Bishop kicking Alien ass. Ripley was a strong protagonist, but her being female made the producers feel that somehow her gender was integral to the films success. It wasn't. 2 stars for a few interesting moments, and some nostalgia. This was the first film in the series I ever saw so there. Nostalgia.

This one ramps up the intensity with a real scary bad guy character, who is written superbly. The overall writing always seems to work with Sparks novels. I've never ditched one yet.

B0055QYKQO|2.0|I bought this motherboard after doing alot of research. Got the Revision 1.0 board and found I couldnt get the computer to boot.  Came to find out that even though the box says all over it is AM3+ ready that doesnt mean ready.  I contacted their tech department was \\"Get a non FX series chip and install the bios update\\" LITERALLY!!!  Their answer to me was to go buy another chip to get the board working the way it was advertised. I ended up having to go to a Computer repair store and PAY someone to update the bios. This is something I should not have to have done. I could have spent the extra money and gotten a used ASUS.  I can say this much... I will not be doing business with this company again. One big head ache. And you have to love that customer service response.  Other then the boxes lies, and bad customer service the board seems to work once I paid for the bios update. Give it a month... It'll probably die.

B0062NAVXA|5.0|First of all, let's get this out of the way: Yes, it's true, this is a movie produced by Christians with Christian messages and ideals in the movie. With that said, no matter how you look at it, this is a positive movie with good messages - and is one unique movie. To my knowledge, there just are no other movies out there like it with the main message it works so hard to portray. There is no comparison because there literally is nothing to compare it to (as far as I know anyway).  If you are not a Christian, I do definitely think you can still enjoy and get value from this movie, but it is true that you might be less likely to enjoy it then the Christian audience would - but this would largely depend on whether you would be deeply offended at hearing some Christian doctrine and teaching in a movie. Many non-Christians are (as evidenced by some of the 1 star reviews here). But some are more \\"tolerant\\" of such views. It would depend where you are on the spectrum.  At the end of the day, the core of this movie promotes fathers taking responsibility for themselves and their families and living honorably. I mean, that is pretty much the clear takeaway of the movie. To those that are not Christians that want to knock this movie for its clear Christian content and influences, I would ask them what part of this message is so horrible? Would they be more comfortable with a movie that shows and teaches fathers to be deadbeats (as plenty of other movies out there do?) Sadly the answer to that might be \\"yes\\". Some people will knock this movie for \\"preaching\\" (which it does!) but fail to realize that EVERY movie they have ever seen has preached SOMETHING to them - some more subtly perhaps, but there's always messages transmitted. And the vast majority of those movies haven't preached a message to them nearly as positive as this one! (unless you consider teaching you to curse - including cursing God - as much as you can, lust as much as you want, and generally behave as indecently as you can, \\"positive\\". I don't.)  Now, to Christians I would say: This is a movie that EVERY Christian adult should see, especially fathers (though the themes are relevant for mothers as well). Created by the same church ministry that produced \\"Fireproof\\" (another excellent, unique movie that every Christian that is married or thinks they want to be someday should watch!) and \\"Facing the Giants\\" (also worthwhile but see my amazon review on it for more info), this one takes it to a whole new level.  I echo a Focus On The Family reviewer when they said: \\"Courageous isn't so much a movie for the whole family as it is a movie for the benefit of the whole family. Discernment should be used in deciding how young is too young to watch drug dealers shooting at and fighting with policemen.\\" The movie is PG-13, and probably appropriately rated. Although I know many have watched this movie with their children, I really am not sure it is that wise of an idea to actually watch it with your children, not just because of some of the violence (which isn't that bad all things considered), but because of the themes in the movie. The themes are great for adults to view and consider, but I don't see much benefit - and actually I can envision potential harm - for children (just my opinion).  This movie is uniquely put together and very well-paced: you will cry and you will laugh, but it is paced in such a way that it doesn't overwhelm you (i.e. after an intense dramatic scene, you get some light-heartedness). The acting is pretty good (no, it's not \\"perfect\\") but it's perfectly fine and very believable - the emotional scenes in the movie I would think would be tough scenes to \\"get right\\" and it looks to me like they hit them perfectly!  No, the \\"movie quality\\" does not look like the latest Hollywood blockbuster (though it's not terribly far, either). But it also certainly doesn't look like a movie that was made with only a million dollars (which was its budget). Given the amount of movies out there with 200 or 300 million dollar budgets that are trash (I'm being kind) with all sorts of negative messages, this movie shows you don't need a lot of money to produce a really good, positive movie with life-changing impact!  My one \\"concern\\" (but it is just nitpicking): I admit when I watched this the first time in the theater that the music placement seemed more about trying to \\"show off\\" Christian music in the movie than actually contributing to the story (unlike Fireproof).  However, since watching it again, I realize that wasn't justified.  For instance, I didn't realize on my first watch that the song the father danced to was the same one the girl danced to earlier in the movie.  And when they had that song playing (with him putting in the CD) right after a music montage with another contemporary Christian song, it just \\"hit me wrong\\".  In retrospect, now I can say that it really is an \\"important part of the movie\\" - but if I were doling out any advice for the future I might suggest they avoid 2 music songs literally back-to-back like that as it could give the wrong impression.  Indeed, I have seen reviews where non-Christians jumped on this, as well as the seeming promotion of other Christian products (including movie spin-off products).  One could easily argue that it was done to help deepen the impact/ministry impact of the movie, and I would probably even agree, but I'm just saying it seemed a bit obvious in a way that I'm not sure is all that helpful in the long run (but maybe it is, I don't know).  Blu-ray quality: Great. I own the Blu-ray and DVD. Compared to the DVD, the Blu-ray is noticeably sharper and clearer (as it should be) and colors were bright and natural (as they should be). It also was great to see several of the extras in HD as well.  I would recommend everyone watch this movie in Blu-ray - it is worth it!  By the way, I also recommend that everyone that likes this movie watch it with the commentary track turned on at least once - you will learn some interesting things and see how some scenes relate that you might not have caught.  Other thoughts: I seriously wondered if, after the success of \\"Fireproof\\", the producers might be tempted - as many ministries are that start in the Spirit but then experience great success - to end up producing the next item more in the \\"flesh\\". I think I can hands-down say that this did NOT happen with \\"Courageous\\".  Beyond the obvious fruit of these movies that have come out of the Kendrick brothers and Sherwood Baptist Church, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the backstory. I love the fact that the whole Sherwood Pictures thing came about as a desire to really reach people for God (i.e. the motivations seem to have been/be right!) and out of a willingness to think outside the box (i.e. not just trying to \\"copy\\" what others are doing!). It wasn't started to make money. It was/is a ministry! There's a MAJOR difference in that. And I believe God has clearly blessed and honored that. Here you've got a 3,000-member church in Georgia that has managed to majorly influence millions of people because they dared to believe they could with God's help (and with the right motives). Author Randy Alcorn, who wrote the novelization for \\"Courageous\\", said this:  \\"...the Sherwood story is distinctly different, in that it happened completely outside the mainstream. It wasn't birthed by a producer or a publisher, the way movies and books, whether secular or Christian, typically are. It began with the vision of a few church leaders who solicited the help of their local church, learning and improvising as they went. There's a great deal of creativity in local churches, lots of great songwriting and musical performances and even some quality drama. But it's often limited to songs sung by the choir, skits that illustrate sermon points, or localized Christmas and Easter pageants. People may come to these events from thirty miles away, but almost never do they break out of a community and achievea regional status, much less a national or international one. Sherwood Pictures is in many ways unparalleled, a Cinderella story of staggering proportions. How could a church in Albany, Georgia have produced four films, counting Courageous, that have already had an amazing national and international impact, selling millions of DVDs and spinoff books? How could they have done so with mostly volunteer labor, at a fraction of the cost of conventional movie-making? Each movie has been better than its predecessor, and ten times better than what could be expected for the budget. But Courageous raises the bar to a whole new level. When many people see Courageous, they won't be thinking, 'Not bad, for a church' or 'Not bad considering it wasn't done by Hollywood.' A lot of people will just be thinking, 'Wow, this is a really good movie.'\\"  I would concur. And I believe that God is still looking for men and women that will, in honest sincerity, with right motivations, seek God's heart on how He might want to use them to impact our world.  I believe there's just as much a lesson for the Church in the backstory of Sherwood Pictures as in the actual movies they have produced. In fact, many of the themes that these movies portray kind of seem to mirror and are proved out by the reality of the backstory. For instance, it takes a lot of COURAGE and integrity to do what they have done - they've certainly had to be \\"Courageous\\" themselves. In \\"Facing the Giants\\", the main message was that when you follow Christ, nothing is impossible - that there is nothing impossible with God - and with faith in God (and living an \\"excellent\\" life - i.e. the \\"works\\" part of the \\"faith without works is dead\\" thing) and desiring for God to get the glory, that God is able to do beyond what we could even imagine. They've certainly proven that out!  I for one get really excited when I see good Christian movies (or Christian-themed movies such as the Narnia series) because that is one area that non-Christians have had a monopoly on for far too long. It's refreshing to see what the medium can really accomplish when it is God-ordained and used for/to promote good, rather than demonically-ordained and used for/to promote evil.

In my mind, Nightwish created the \\"Symphonic Rock/Metal\\" or \\"Goth\\" sound, but with the release of this CD...Within Temptation has perfected it! Although there isn't a bad song on the CD, my personal favorites are Faster and A Demon's Fate. If you purchase the special edition, you will also get another great song, \\"I Don't Wanna\\". I encourage you use YouTube or Spotify to sample the songs that I mentioned above. I'm confident that you'll buy this CD after hearing them!!
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Great entertainment.  It has great fight scenes, good acting and a family drama.  My wife and I both enjoyed this movie.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a great application. I only wish I could download an audio Bible recording and listen off line. But, this is still a great app!
B004U52VPS|4.0|Good quality toy.  Good learning tool for building and launching birds.  The game itself is fun, enjoyable to play AB in 3D.<br /><br />The birds and pigs are a good thick rubber and the blocks are a durable plastic.  Think rugged like a Lego.  They feel about as good on bare feet.  Make sure you pick up some AB band-aids for your feet.
0385523394|1.0|This book was given to me by a friend in my book club. When asked how she liked it she said, \\"So, so\\". Now I know why. I hoped I would find a book rich in detail and a real human story. All I found was a superficial story; now I am ABSOLUTELY SURE the author went to Smith, has long blond hair, has a supportive fiancé, tons of friends who line up to visit her in prison, ...and did I say she went to Smith??? This is a self serving story, filled with personal accolades and  no real in-depth depiction of what millions of women endure. I also know that everyone in prison LOVED her (did her Smith education show somehow??) and that the rules she had to follow were an annoyance to her..tsk, tsk, tsk..the food was BAD.  This book is not worth reading and is actually irritating, especially if you know women of color with no means who have nothing and who are incarcerated. Here's to the author who has now made $$ on this self indulgent book ..now she can describe herself as an ex-con, go on the rubber chicken circuit and talk about her \\"ordeal\\"...BTW, did you know she went to Smith, has long blond hair, is loved by all ??...etc, etc.
B003L77G06|4.0|We enjoy that series that it seems cannot be made in France : fun, in touch with society, sometimes moving, and enjoyed by the whole family (modern or otherwise).  The only thing that spoils our pleasure somewhat : we aren't yet good enough at English to do completely away with subtitles, and the French translation really sucks. We hope it improves for the 3rd season !
B004MC8CA2|5.0|The people at Lifechurch.Tv puts a lot of time and attention into constantly improving this great app.  Continually adding new reading plans, new translations and even offering numerous translations for download so you can still read if you are outside of wi-fi range.  No other app comes close.  You can create a free account and access your plans on almost any device, Android, Kindle, Apple...even your computer.  And this is all for FREE, a gift from Lifechurch.

B0058EBNAO|5.0|If you ever turn off your data for any reason this is the weather app for you because it predicts the weather hourly and still estimates correctly when there is no data and shows on the widgets the last update.

0385523912|5.0|Barbara Demick long and insightful history in the lives of several citizens of the \\"great\\" north Korea country. This is real people and real experiences that are detailed with the beginning and ends with where they are now. Nothing to Envy details and explains key events in the country's history and the horrors that the citizens had to endure just to survive in a country that only cares about its army. This is a great book and a quick read i recommend this book to everyone.
B0013TTLDE|5.0|I like Kate Morton's books.  Her characters are rich and multifaceted.  She winds story lines together in a wonderful way jumping gracefully through time and keeping the reader guessing until the last minute.

B006ZDU7QI|4.0|Gotye (pronounced: go-ti-yay) is the stage moniker of Belgium-born Wally de Backer, who moved to Australia at a young age and it is there that he built his musical career. Gotye has been at it for a number of years as part of the Aussie band the Basics but also issuing several solo albums: in 2003 there was \\"Boardface\\" and in 2006 \\"Like Drawing Blood\\" (remixed the next year as \\"Mixed Blood\\"). Now after a 5 year absence comes the new album. If you're not familiar with the sound of Gotye, the best comparison I can think of would be a strangely appealing mix of Beck, George Michael and Seal, if you can believe that.<br /><br />\\"Making Mirrors\\" (originally released in August, 2011; 12 tracks; 42 min.) starts off with the 1 min. appetizer that is the title track, only then then dive into \\"Easy Way Out\\". The third track is \\"Somebody That I Used to Know\\", a duet with New Zealand singer Kimbra, and the single that has propelled this album out of obscurity last year into a megahit in Australia and Europe (check out also the video of this song, not to be missed!). \\"Smoke and Mirrors\\" is an irresitable stomper. \\"I Feel Better\\" sounds like Motown-revisted. \\"Don't Worry, We'll Be Watching You\\" is a reggae tune. The musical flavors are all over on this album, and as a result this is a very diverse-sounding and immensly enjoyable Gotye album.<br /><br />This album was released outside the US last August. I picked up the physical CD on a recent home visit to Belgium, where the album remains a top seller 5 months after its release. While the album has been available as an import here on Amazon, the album is finally getting a proper release in the US in early 2012. It's not too late to jump on the Gotye band wagon! His upcoming US tour is already sold out in most venues. Meanwhile \\"Making Mirrors\\" is highly recommended!

1451627289|5.0|This is an excellent, thought provoking book.  It is well worth reading, and will give you a lot to think about when it comes to the idea of time travel.  Not incidentally, it is also a great love story.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Anyone can sell a horror, a rom-com, a fantasy or an epic storyline to a captured audience. Not that hard. But, by way of metaphor, it takes a creative mind to look at a desert of what to most of us is a seemingly endless sand and see hidden beauty and then guide the rest of us in how to also find beauty in a desert. Thus, the back room machinations of baseball are not normally likely to wake even a snail from it's slumber (let alone most of us humans) yet Pitt crafted this tale so well that even the snails in my yard were unwaveringly intrigued by this story. Snails vote five stars.  On rather insignificant minor notes: First, \\"The Show\\" sung by Dorsey in the movie was around 2002 but wasn't written/released by Lenka until 2008/2009. My second minor note is the interpretation of the metaphor at the end of the movie. First, Beane says \\"I made one decision in my life based on money. And, I swore I would never do it again.\\" Which is actually a form of rigid thinking that the premise of the movie argues against. One poor decision doesn't imprison you to all subsequent decisions of that type. Then the metaphor comes in, \\"You're doing it for what the money says. That you're worth it.\\" \\"He hit a home run and didn't even realize it.\\" All suggest to me that Beane's thinking out of the box worked and all that the money does is confirm it. So he should have gone to where the support was (in all it's forms).
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I find this app very useful for my everyday thoughts. Just wish it had more options for me to really customize my notes.
1451648537|4.0|This book was entertaining. Jobs is a unique figure in American history. The book has some great leadership quotes, business insights and a long list of things to not do if you want successful personal relationships. After reading the book I would summarize Jobs this way:  Brilliant strategist  Awesome recruiter  Infrequent bather  Charming walker  Insufferable jerk  Hard worker  Credit stealer  Wonderful designer  Reluctant father  Distant husband  In short, something to marvel at and be amazed of but not someone to idolize or copy, at all.
B002OHK7CS|5.0|Love the bikes, love the MC, love SAMCRO. If you ride check it out, if you get all worked up seeing someone else riding, watch this show. Men and women alike love this, my husband and I can watch it together and neither of us can wait for the next episode! Nudity, violence, language but come on, it's a show about an MC that runs guns.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|If you are \\"in\\" to the Planet of the Apes\\" series of movies, then this is for you. It is a thoughtfully crafted prequel with references to the \\"future\\" movies sprinkled carefully throughout it's length. Some of the scenes are pure magic and by the time the movie is over you are firmly certain (again) that humans suck a lot of the time. Hooray for Caesar !
B0017ZB8M6|3.0|Contrary to Firework, only a few good songs are worth keeping. Listen to them all before you buy the entire CD.
0307888681|4.0|I couldn't understand the fascination with zombies lately: on tv, in the movies, even in my small town where groups of 'zombies' wander around the trails even when it's not Halloween---uh, ok, maybe they're just normal people in my weird town, not sure. After I finished reading this novel, I turned to the back cover and discovered that the book is categorized as 'Fiction-Horror' which is a genre I've always passed over when looking for a good read. So why did I even pick it up? I read somewhere that a movie has recently been filmed based on this novel, and one of my fav actors is in it so of course, I want to watch it when it's in theaters or on streaming. But, expecting that the book itself wouldn't hold much of an interest for me, and that I'd just browse through or read the first few pages before putting it down, I'm surprised that I ended up reading it cover to cover. Though it did become a bit tedious towards the end because of the technical descriptions and numerous characters presented, I found the novel enjoyable...in a grim sort of way.
B0000C23DO|5.0|Ok, with this 'Best Of' compilation, the big draw is obviously the songs, which are stellar. But add the remastering, and what you get is a great listening experience. This CD has all of the heavyweights, such as TRUCKIN', TOUCH OF GREY, CASEY JONES and THE GOLDEN ROAD, plus many other enjoyable favorites like ESTIMATED PROPHET, EYES OF THE WORLD, and RIPPLE. I just wished they had included St. Stephen and Rosemary (my two all-time favorites), but those can be found on SKELETONS FROM THE CLOSET, which is a more condensed 'Best Of' collection. Still, this CD is a good listen for the casual fan. It offers a mini journey through the Dead's early days through their late 80's conclusion. One can definitely hear their evolution as a band through these 17 tracks.
B00701L5XS|5.0|User friendly, especially for novices such as myself, but can see it would be useful for any avid knot guru. Love the animation and pause features. A+.
B006WWP5KA|5.0|Love this show! Each one leaves you wanting more and more. Love the characters, both the good and the evil. If you like the vampire stuff you will love this series. The only thing I wish that would change would be that more episodes would be put out and quicker! lol

B001AYENBM|2.0|I gave 3 stars instead of 1 because I really like this movie - Will Smith did an exceptional job, along with the rest of the cast.  Usually with remakes, I prefer the original but not in this case; and I really like Charlton Heston movies (referring to \\"Omega Man\\").  This remake did so much better with regard to action; what someone might go through mentally with the loss of family, let alone being the only person left on earth; and some reality with what you see in the background of the film.  So the film does well mixing some good drama and action enough to keep you from hitting the stop button because the science fiction part is so unrealistic.  However, this \\"alternate\\" ending sucked, to put it mildly.  I'm not going to give it away, but puh-leeze.  Okay, this movie IS science fiction, but this alternate ending kind of put it over the top as far as stupidity is concerned.  I liked the original ending better, although sad it left me with a feeling of hope better than this version did.
B00008DDXC|5.0|This movie was very well made.  It followed the books quite closely, but was still uniquely it's own.  Absolutely loved it!  The product came just as it said it would.  A good addition to any movie collection.

0307595862|5.0|I picked up THE SNOWMAN hoping to add another good serial killer novel to my recommendation list (that includes [[ASIN:0679733973 The Killer Inside Me]], [[ASIN:0061778915 Zombie: A Novel]], [[ASIN:1460914627 i, Killer: A novel]], and [[ASIN:0316290238 The Collector (Back Bay Books)]]).  I don't know whether it qualifies, not because it isn't good:  THE SNOWMAN is great.  But it deals more with the investigation of a series of serial murders of women with children.  My serial killer interest is in the psychology of the killer, novelized and presented in either first- or third-person.<br /><br />What makes THE SNOWMAN outstanding is what makes any crime novel superior, or any novel, for that matter:  the characters, in particular Norwegian Police Service Inspector Harry Hole.  Nesbo has written nine Harry Hole novels to date (seven translated by Dan Barlett, which tells me English readers are getting a true representation of Nesbo's style); THE SNOWMAN is the seventh in the series.  While THE SNOWMAN is my introduction, I can see that Harry has quite a history.  He's a tortured man who turned to the bottle.  He's off booze when the novel opens but does succumb a couple of times before confronting the snowman killer.  Who wouldn't when you believe the killer wants to involve you in his crazy destructive plans.  However, the biggest part of his problem lies with his passion for Rakel, his girlfriend, who has pitched him for a doctor; who broke off their affair because she saw Harry had only one love:  the cop shop.  As with alcohol, Harry can't stay away from her and she can't keep her hands off him.  Bad, but good, too, for readers, as it intensifies a very dramatic, some might say overwrought, ending.<br /><br />As for the serial killer, I will say he's an interestingly demented fellow.  I really can't say too much about him, otherwise I might give him away.  I will say astute readers will have a good idea who he is quite early in the book.  That doesn't much hurt the book, as the real interest is in Harry.  I will also say Nesbo does a good job with certain abnormalities that both drive the plot and give reason and credence to the killer.  I will also say the killer builds snowmen as harbingers of death; uses them to kill with; leaves no complete bodies; employs a most unusual tool that probably will be new to you; and harbors a hatred toward women with certain types of children.<br /><br />An added feature is the locale.  Norway and Oslo are beautiful places.  I visited the city many years ago in June, to be awakened by roaring cars and bright sunshine at one in the morning.  Of course, the opposite is the case in the novel:  it's November, the first snows are falling, and the days are turning into gray, short affairs, the perfect atmosphere for hunting down a lunatic killer.  Highly recommended for aficionados of crime fiction.interest is in Harry.

B004V5QWU2|5.0|I managed to set up two different \\"layered\\" sounds within a couple of minutes after downloading this app. I set it to \\"rain, thunder and wind\\" and was asleep before the \\"timer\\" ran out at 15 minutes.  Woke up in the middle of the night, as usual, and instead of tossing and turning for an hour, I turned on \\"beach and campfire\\" and once again was asleep before the 15 minutes ran out. I've used so many sound machines over the years, and this tops every single one of them. A better dollar I have never spent in my life. Works perfectly on the Kindle Fire. Will save me a fortune in Tylenol PM.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|This is a very good series. The series is getting a little long though without a lot of new plot development or character introduction. Still, a good read.

B005LY4B0A|5.0|This app is great! Something kids and adults can enjoy. It challenges and sometimes frustrates as you try to figure out the very best way to set the bugs free. I got it as a free app of the day, but it's good enough to pay for. I play on my droid 2 global. Enjoy!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game because you have more then just one game you can also unlock new games. its awesome

B0007MWZEK|5.0|I love my swivel sweeper.  This is my second one.  The battery stopped charging on my first one.  I ordered another battery, which worked until I tried to recharge it.  It will not charge on my new sweeper charger either.  But I like the sweeper enough to invest in a second one.
0439023491|5.0|The second book was every bit as good as the first!  I love the way Suzanne Collins weaves her stories.  You never know what's going to happen next, and hardly have time to \\"guess\\" as you're so engrossed in the story!  I am SO glad I wasn't reading these as they were originally published.  As soon as I finished this, I HAD to start the third book.  AMAZING books!
B005HSG3U6|4.0|I like the material.  It has a sturdiness that will give added protection..  The only issue I have is with the stand feature.  After a few uses, it became floppy, and I used the hint given by one of the reviewers.  wrap the strap around the folded stand.
B006TGX27M|5.0|I got into Lacuna Coil about a decade ago and have loved every album I got my hands on... except Shallow Life.  Except for the song Spellbound, it all just fell flat to me due to the heavy electronic influence.  I sighed, shrugged my shoulders, and figured that this might be one of those cases where a group I once loved moved in a direction I could not follow.  When I heard Dark Adrenaline was coming out, I had my fingers crossed but little hope. Turned out to be more than pleasantly surprised, though.  The band seems to have returned to more of a strict rock base.  The bassline is rocking, the play off between voices is great, and every song was at least a 4 out of 5 for me.  Not exactly a return to basics but, at least for me, a return to the good stuff.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I think its one of those games where you get all the bonus in the beginning but later on you think that it takes too long so you shoot for the minimum. overall, great game:)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the game is good for passing time. i travel a lot so it's good for airplanes when there's nothing to do or watch. as long as you don't upgrade the game, you'll be happy.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game a lot it plays.good on my kindle I love love love love it :)) love it
0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is an amazing book!  I finished it in HOURS.  I couldn't put it down - could hardly stand to take the time to turn the page!  I can't recommend a book more highly than this (except maybe the other two in the series!)  Suzanne Collins' writing is simply riveting.  GET THIS BOOK!
B004DLPXAO|4.0|Edit: The new update is much better. I've only had this app to crash once and have had no problems since. I would recommend you deregister your device and uninstall before updating. It just makes it easier. Thank you for the fix Amazon!  First I love the new interface. I also like some of the features that came with update. However I kept having problems with the app force closing and I had trouble getting back to the home screen.  I was told to deregister my phone, uninstall, then reinstall.  After doing that yesterday it worked great! I just knew I was finally going to partially retire my ipod touch and start reading on my phone more.  Only problem is, the app won't even open this morning. It just hangs at the Kindle screen until I push something and it force closes.  I'm not even going to start on how huge this app is.  Please fix this.
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|Black Country Communion is a supergroup who play classic rock music which features Glen Hughes, Jason Bonham, Joe Bonamassa and Derek Sherinian all of whom are gifted musicians and have been involved with high quality, respectable music separately and work really well together within the group.<br /><br />Their self-titled debut album was released in 2010 and is far from a flimsy and insubstantial collaboration between friends, but is an extremely well put together, lengthy and memorable album that both stands up musically on its own merits and flows well from beginning to end.<br /><br />In addition to featuring a strong line-up and being in a genre which I enjoy, I think the production job on the record is superb, and everything sounds really great, especially Jason Bonham's toms.<br /><br />While still feeling cohesive and complete, the album is far from repetitive and covers a variety of musical ground. Vocals for example, are primarily handled by the very talented Glen Hughes who adds some soul influences to the rock formula but then Joe Bonamassa also sings on four of the songs bringing more of his blues based style into the overall sound.<br /><br />Tracks such as the Title Track, `Beggarman' and `Sista Jane' are straight up hard and heavy rock numbers, `Down Again' mixes in a little of the Funk feelings of Hughes era Deep Purple and both 'Too Late For The Sun' and `Medusa' are longer and slower tracks with more keys and atmosphere.<br /><br />Overall, Black Country Communion are a great band and this debut album is a strong effort that is well produced, musically interesting and stylistically excellent.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|I have been using this since its initial appearance on the G1. It was a little shakey at first and I know the change in permissions on the free version put off a few, but but this app is totally worth it. I love the fact that it now pulls up the lyrics and even displays them in 3D on my EVO 3D.
B0068TL23G|5.0|Fun game but I agree with previous reviewers that path editing is frustrating with only the ability to undo the last path drawn instead of any path. It also needs a puzzle redo to try for a better score. Hopefully the developers will respond with an update. Fun, challenging, and addictive.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first saw this book i thought i would hate it! I started reading and was quickly drawn in. After a few pages it becomes hard to put the book down. The kind of book you'll stay up at night just to read \\"one more chapter\\"
0439023513|5.0|I adored this book!  I felt like I was dying throughout it when Peeta and Katniss weren't together, and many times wanted to yell at her for not seeing the obvious, but Katiss was always Katniss.  The girl, oblivious to herself.  I LOVED how the book unfolded, and she gradually became aware of herself and how her actions influenced the world.  I felt it was very relatable, as it's how most of us become self-aware.  THANK YOU, SUZANNE COLLINS, for the way you ended this book.  It was perfect.  It was what my heart needed.  I keep re-reading the end in my head, and I just love it.  I wish there were more books, but I am completely satisfied with how this ended.  I'm tempted to go back and start re-reading all three immediately!

B0051CSIKQ|4.0|I downloaded this to my ipod to have sumthing to watch on my way to work on the bus.  I must say it was really awesome!  I dont wanna give away the movie but it was worth the 10 bucks i bought it for on itunes!  The last vamp movie i liked was 30 days of night and that was forever ago!  check this movie out my fellow horrorians.  u wont be sorry!
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|This movie is awesome!!! I felt in love with this one!! Even it had its scenes kind of low budget, but that's no problem at all!! the lycans CGI effects were better than the first 3! and the giant Lycan that appears in this movie!! is mega awesome!!! so! I recommend this movie to all of you!! grab a ticket a go watch it at the movies with your family and friends. =D!! 10 stars out of 10!!!

1250006341|5.0|Fans of the period drama Downton Abbey will love this beautiful book from its darling pastel blue cover to the wonderful, color photographs peppered throughout its pages (there was also a bonus bookmark in the book which was the PBS ad for Season Two). The book begins with a foreword by Julian Fellowes, describing his own fascination with English country homes, and how Downton Abbey came about (purely by chance, it seems).<br /><br />This being a book about the production, the chapters are organized under several themes:<br />Family Life - begins with an \\"upstairs-downstairs\\" portrait gallery, followed by insights into the family life of the Granthams as portrayed in the show with excerpts of interviews with the actors (who tell us about how filming is done, their routine, etc.); readers also learn how the various servants at Downton Abbey operate within the larger machinery of the household and it certainly makes for interesting reading about a life that seems so far removed from today's (for example, one learns that kitchen maid Daisy's character is an amalgamation of several different roles, i.e. a scullery maid, a vegetable maid, and a stillroom maid). I greatly enjoyed reading about the duties performed by various members of staff and the real-life anecdotes by those who had actually been in service such as the reminiscence of Gordon Grimmet who had been in service to the Astors. There are even practical household tips from the servants!<br /><br />Society - back in the Edwardian Era (the period in which Downton Abbey is set) and earlier, one truly had to be born into society to be accepted into the fold.There are delightful titbits of information about how Consuelo Vanderbilt learned about society etiquette; a feature on the real-life Cora, Lady Curzon; and even the ceremony of coming out into society, all of which enhance the main text which delves into the lives of the Granthams in society.<br /><br />Change - describes the coming of the First World War, and how this affects the various residents at Downton Abbey, both the Granthams and their servants.<br /><br />Life in Service - the servants generally display a great deal of pride in their work, evident especially in Carson and Mrs. Hughes (the butler and the housekeeper, respectively).<br />Style - beautiful , beautiful, costumes! with lots of gorgeous color photos.<br />House and Estate - how filming is done at Highclere Castles, the building that is featured as Downton Abbey, etc.<br />Romance - goes into details regarding the romance between Lady Mary and the heir to Downton, Matthew Crawley; the valet Bates and the head housemaid Anna Smith; and others.<br />War - how the First World War forms the backdrop to the story of the family and the servants<br />Behind the Scenes - filming etc.<br /><br />Towards the end, there is a cast list, and suggestions for further reading.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book to all fans of Downton Abbey!how this affects the various residents at Downton Abbey, both the Granthams and their servants.<br /><br />Life in Service - the servants generally display a great deal of pride in their work, evident especially in Carson and Mrs. Hughes (the butler and the housekeeper, respectively).<br />Style - beautiful , beautiful, costumes! with lots of gorgeous color photos.<br />House and Estate - how filming is done at Highclere Castles, the building that is featured as Downton Abbey, etc.<br />Romance - goes into details regarding the romance between Lady Mary and the heir to Downton, Matthew Crawley; the valet Bates and the head housemaid Anna Smith; and others.<br />War - how the First World War forms the backdrop to the story of the family and the servants<br />Behind the Scenes - filming etc.<br /><br />Towards the end, there is a cast list, and suggestions for further reading.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this book to all fans of Downton Abbey!
185984054X|2.0|This is an ambitious attempt at iconoclasm from a world-class iconoclast that is absolutely undone by the author's style of writing. From the overly catty title to the confused layout, the book is frustrating when it should be enlightening and only works for about fifteen pages in the middle when substance is finally allowed to triumph over style.  Hitchens has some fantastic observations about the misguided ways in which Mother Theresa \\"helps\\" the poor but in fact just makes them suffer. Those fifteen pages are worth reading, without question. But he works them towards a flimsy thesis that Mother Theresa was some kind of diabolical genius. In doing so, he assumes that the reader knows quite a bit about Mother Theresa and the Catholic Church already, and disdains them both. He doesn't give any kind of history of the woman until 4/5's of the way through, at which point he assumes that the reader knows the major players in 1930's Albanian politics. His scattershot rambling approach to an argument really does him no justice. It's a boon to his work as an essayist, but it's the reason his books are all slight, pithy, and dense. This book needed to guide the reader, but Hitchens never constructs anything like a narrative.  I view this as a blown opportunity. The evidence of Mother Theresa's woes on humanity are not hard to find. You can see a nice overview in the \\"Criticism\\" section of her Wikipedia page. Her goal was not to heal but to convert. She would give deathbed baptisms to Hindus and Muslims without their explicit consent. She would deny antibiotics to the sick and painkillers to the dying--she seemed to think suffering was making her charges more Christ-like. She viewed the influx of donations as an endorsement of her methods from God, but the money went unspent and/or unaccounted for. People suffered needlessly under her care. There is no question that she did horrible things and was never held to account by the world at large.  But the stronger argument is notthat Mother Theresa was a bad person, but that she was an exemplary Catholic and that Catholic doctrine writ large is as great an evil now as it was during the Inquisition. Hitchens dances around this, but never quite nails it. The Catholic prohibition on contraception--largely ignored in the first world--is one of the issues Mother Theresa championed alongside abortion. And to this day those prohibitions are a direct cause of the third world being flush with the starving children that Mother Theresa's nuns look after. The irony is flabbergasting, but Hitchens would have us believe that it's all part of some evil scheme towards beatification, and I don't think he argued it strongly enough.  It pains me to rate this as low as I did. I'm a fan of Christopher Hitchens and view his death as a serious loss to the intellectual world. But this is far from his best work. It's too long and too comprehensive to work as an essay, but it's too short and disorganized to work as a book. In the end, I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|Got this as a free app of the day and love it. Only real complaint would be that it's almost too scientific and requires you to understand a lot about weather to figure out the forecast.

B005LAIGGY|1.0|Three of us went to see this movie and none of us cared for it.  We wish we would have gone to Joyful Music instead.  The theatre was pretty much empty, about ten people there.  We heard no positive comments on the way out.  If you are into watching and rewatching the horrors of 911 and people not knowing what to do with their pain then maybe this movie is for you.  I regret I went and would not have if I had done a background check into what it was about.  All I can say is for me it was a complete waste of time, money, and a complete disappointment for what was to be an enjoyable gathering with friends.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Easy to set up and secure... :) This works well on the Kindel Fire. I found it a bargain for what it does.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I agree with the review that said the book wasn't put together very well. At times it feels like a though that's never finished. But nobody coming from a person who was cheated out of a normal life of finishing high school and going to college, the book was written very well. A lot of us wonder what Jaycee went through. And it's hard for a person to go through something like that, then be pushed into a spotlight. I hate that we, as Americans push cameras into the personal lives of people who have gone through such tragedy, but I am as guilty as the next one wanting to hear the story. This book was as much about Jaycee's healing as it was about filling in the blanks for all of us that are happy to hear she is alive, healthy, and now back home with her family. I hope this book also opens the eyes of law enforcement, that they will try to do more with sick people like Phillip Garrido.

0307949486|1.0|I did not like the book that much due to the plot and some of the characters' actions so there will be SPOILERS ahead.<br /><br />Mikael Blomkvist is a financial journalist who got convicted of libeling the industrialist Hans-Erik Wennerstrom.  After his conviction, the retired CEO of the Vanger Corporations, Henrik Vanger, hires him to solve the mystery of his grand-niece's disappearance who he believes was murdered.  Eventually, Lisbeth Salander joins forces with Blomkvist to help solve the case.  It turns out that the current CEO of Vanger Corporations, Martin Vanger, is a sadistic serial killer of women who was taught to kill by his dad, the late Gottfried Vanger.  Martin captures Blomkvist in the torture chamber built into his house and is about to kill him when Lisbeth shows up and beats Martin with a golf club.  Then Martin drives away and crashes fatally into a truck.  Blomkvist wants to call the police but Lisbeth insists that they do not call the police.  A short while later, she comes back to Martin's house and destroys a huge amount of evidence that Martin kept of his crimes, such as photo books and his computer.  The only photos that she keeps are those of Harriet Vanger, the missing grand-niece of Henrik Vanger.  It turns out that Harriet was not murdered but had changed her identity and is now living in Australia.  She had been in hiding because her brother Martin wanted to sexually abuse her and threatened to expose the fact that she had killed her dad, Gottfried, if she did not do as he pleased.  Blomkvist travels to Australia to confront Harriet and Harriet decides to come out of hiding and meet her grand-uncle again and become the new CEO of Vanger Corporations.  Blomkvist then goes back to digging up dirt on Wennerstrom using Lisbeth's computer hacking skills.  He writes a whole book on Wennerstrom's corrupt dealings which explodes in the media and redeems Millenium and Blomkvist.  Wennerstrom's location is revealed by Lisbeth to a lawyer which results in Wennerstrom's murder supposedly by someone who he owed money and now could not pay back.<br /><br />One problem that I had with the book is the subject of Harriet's disappearance.  How could she let her family and especially the grand-uncle who loved her so much think that she was dead for all those years?  Her grand-uncle spent half of his life trying to solve what he thought to be her murder.  She could have sent him a clearer message that she was still alive than the cryptic flowers.  Furthermore, if she told people about Gottfried's murders and his sexual abuse of Martin and her, nobody would have blamed her for killing him.<br /><br />What bothers me the most about the book is the fact that Martin and Gottfried Vanger's crimes were never exposed to the public.  For a journalist who prides himself on exposing corrupt industrialists, Blomkvist is very hypocritical when he spends the last part of the book working to expose Wennerstrom but agreeing to cover up the sadistic crimes associated with the Vanger Corporation.  Wennerstrom's crimes only involved money which pales in comparison to Martin's sadistic killings.  I assume Blomkvist did not want to destroy the Vanger Corporation's reputation and hurt Harriet Vanger, but this is hypocritical since he has no problems destroying other corporations because of the actions of their CEO's.  Also, Harriet Vanger had an alter identity that she could have gone back to.  Was it so important that Harriet Vanger could become a successful CEO of two companies (instead of just the sheep farm) that Blomkvist agreed to cover up the crimes?  Furthermore, I cannot understand Lisbeth's motivations in not calling the police.  If she did not want to blow her cover, she could have made up a story that she was just there as Blomkvist's lover.  And why did she destroy the evidence?  How will all the girls then get justice?  I don't think she cared about protecting the Vanger Corporation and Millenium would not have needed theVangers' support anyway since she could dig up incriminating dirt on Wennerstrom.  Lisbeth is supposed to be a protector of and fighter for oppressed women but her actions here do not seem consistent.  I don't think I will be reading the second and third books of the trilogy because I can't enter a world where corporations are exposed and destroyed for financial crimes but sadistic killings associated with other corporations are covered up to protect the corporation.she could dig up incriminating dirt on Wennerstrom.

030788743X|4.0|description [no spoilers]:  The OASIS is a virtual reality video game that has become the most played in the planet. You walk around, complete quests, talk to other people and NCPs (WoW but with a haptic suit). it is used for schooling, entertainment, social activity, etc. But when the unsurprisingly rich creator of the game, James Haliday (an 80's obsessee), dies and decides to leave his fortune to whoever finds the three Easter eggs he has hidden in the game, chaos ensures. This brings us to our main character, Wade Watts (named \\"Parzival\\" in the OASIS), an 80's geek obsessed with finding the Easter Egg. There is an entire group of these people, nicknamed egg hunters, or gunters, that devote every spare moment to finding the egg. but the extremely maliciousness SuXORs (their avatars name always starts with 6 )want to find it so they can destroy the oasis (long story), and have the resources to do it.  the good:  Lots of action, excellent dialogue, nice plot, good character development, techno feel, etc.  the bad:  the ending was <spoiler> very anticlimactic, go their, win, end, I was expecting a big battle or something (there is a big battle, just not one-on-one). <\spoiler> that is the *only* reason I didn't give it 5 stars. Over all a great read.  notes:  not appropriate for children, mentions sex several times, swears, ect.  also, his \\"atheist rant\\" at the beginning wasn't that rant-y. he just said that he didn't believe in god and explained why for a couple of sentences. but to be fair, I'm an atheist.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|My hope is that people in the USA start to face up to the horrific practices in the factory farm industry and stop it. It takes a strong stomach and real courage to watch those videos of the hell that is these animals' birth to slaughter sufferings and start to feel that, yes, we can find another way - but I KNOW we can do it.  It is unrealistic and, I think, unnecessary for everyone to go vegan. But I feel it is non-negotiable that we should become ethical eaters.  The above book as well as those of Michael Pollen, Gene Baur, etc. can be used as epiphanies to help raise one's conscience to rise above the seductiveness to eat without thinking thrust upon us as we are manipulated by the factory farming industry. Our culture has made it oh so easy to dismiss this issue and just go along with the crowd.  Food is a deeply complicated issue and I am appreciative of those able to write books that start to untangle the threads - humane treatment of animals, healthy eating, environmental issues, keeping food affordable yet of high quality, and many other considerations.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I loved this book. I love King and his many works but this is by far my favorite. Thanks King!
B004LWZW4M|2.0|As if the 2001 remake wasn't enough of a travesty. Can't they leave this alone??? Since I loved the original, and its sequels, and saw the remake, I had to see this out of morbid curiosity.<br /><br />As a film on its own, it wasn't that bad. But knowing where it was coming from (or rather, leading up to, since apparently it is a prequel), it is just so wrong. The original was such a fascinating social commentary. This seemed to say nothing. The fact that a propensity for violence comes along with intelligence did seem to be apparent in the movie (one of MANY fascinating concepts explored in the original), although I imagine that is something that will not be explored in depth until the sequel. (God forbid they make another five of them.) Incidentally, were we not supposed to notice that, while they were treating maybe 20 apes, once they decided to revolt, there were what, hundreds of them storming the city?<br /><br />Why does a drug that makes apes super-intelligent make humans bleed to death when our genetic makeup is so similar? That just figures.<br /><br />Maybe there should be a time limit on prequels / sequels. If it has been long enough that all the original actors, writers, directors, etc. are very old or even dead and cannot participate or even give input, I think it is a little late to add to THEIR work.<br /><br />And yes, the special effects were just great. Wow, did you see the way their faces moved? They were so realistic! It was amazing!!! I like special effects and I'm a big fan of computer animated movies, but sorry, special effects just cannot make a movie. There just has to be more.<br /><br />And now, everyone who loved the movie can vote my review unhelpful.
B006H3MIV8|4.0|I first started hearing bits of this on my favorite NPR station (WUTC- Chattanooga,TN).  First reaction to the first one I heard was \\"Wow, those lyrics are fantastic\\", moments before realizing the song was Dylan's. Hearing new interpretations of his music gives me a new appreciation of the sheer magnitude of Bob Dylan's songwriting skills!<br /><br />I have been listening to Bob since I bought Like a Rolling Stone as a new 45 and have multiple copies of all his albums- LP, cd, SACD, Japanese import, etc., have countless imported bootlegs, and have seen him live numerous times, beginning with the 1974 tour with the Band. I had probably long since taken his songwriting skills for granted (\\"it's Bob- of course it's good!\\"). Hearing so many songs done by so many people with so many different approaches and styles is quite refreshing and absolutely well-valued at the price!  With proceeds going to Amnesty International, the deal is a no-brainer!<br /><br />Even the people who don't like Bob Dylan should be able to appreciate this collection, IMHO.

The book provides an invaluable context in which to understand our limitations. Buy this book.
B004XUMPFQ|2.0|I'm a huge sci-fi fan in general, but this series suffers from a nonsense implementation of an otherwise sound premise. It's basically \\"Johnny Reb in outer space\\". It could be interesting to follow the losers of a futuristic conflict while they struggle to cope after a war. Unfortunately, Whedon phones it in, giving the characters hick accents, pump-action repeater rifles, six-shooters, leather belts and boots, and having them ride horses and rob freight trains, all set to country-western background music. This would have been great if it had been \\"rebels as they would be in the future,\\" but instead we get \\"rebels from the 1850s artificially pasted into the future.\\"  The only reason I give this series 2 stars: every actor here does a good job, and the production, visuals and staging are great. If these same actors and engineers had been given a decent story world and decent writing, I would have been a devoted fan.

B000001GOZ|5.0|Mahler's Symphony No. 6 eludes many listeners and this listener has never been able to understand why that is.  Yes, it is complex, the first movement takes a true task master at the helm to make it cohesive and make sense, and it has some disturbing psychological overlay that makes it 'scary' - not just the hammer blows, but many of the other passages that seem threatening.  But give time for multiple audience hearings and it becomes one of the composer's most exciting symphonies.  This recording from 1995 with Pierre Boulez conducting the Vienna Philharmonic clarifies many of the technical mysteries that perplex some listeners.  This is a smooth, well-designed performance that has some magnificent orchestral playing from the first desk players and the manner in which Boulez paces the work makes sense.  And therein lies part of the overall problem with this recording.  Perhaps it makes too much 'sense', robbing the raw explosions of fate and struggle the work holds.<br /><br />In the current Mahler Project in Los Angeles, conductor Gustavo Dudamel produced an overwhelmingly moving performance with the Los Angeles Philharmonic.  The playing was superb and the symphony seemed as though it passed quickly.  Part of the success of the overall scheme of the performance was Dudamel's taking the alternative placement of the movements, sanctioned by many, by placing the Andante movement from the usual position as the third movement to the position as the second movement.  This allowed some inspiratory relief of the tension from the first movement (Allegro energico) to calm with the inordinately beautiful Andante before stirring up the fates again with the Scherzo.  Perhaps a minor point to some, but to be in the hall and feel the rise and fall of tensions changed by this alternative placement of movements was a revelation, even to those of us who already have the 6th in the blood.<br /><br />Listening to this Boulez performance after the Dudamel experience fills out the palate of appreciation for this magnificent symphony.  We can hope there may be a new recording in the future. Grady Harp, January 12for this magnificent symphony.  We can hope there may be a new recording in the future. Grady Harp, January 12

B0053F042G|5.0|I was kind of expecting this movie to suck, just based on the trailers and the fact that I've never been a big fan of Jake G.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it.  It just shows that you can't always judge a movie without watching it with an open mind.  The acting was great, the plot was intriguing (and very different than what I thought it would be).  Also, the music was very good.  It had a certain depth that most modern scores don't have.  All in all, I would highly recommend this movie.  You may be pleasantly surprised like me!

B005J7K964|5.0|Given the legal entanglements and conflicts it seemed unlikely that there would ever again be an official release of Moroder's restoration/scoring of Lang's Metropolis. I'm very glad they worked things out.<br /><br />Having said that, I was disappointed that little or no restoration work per-se was done to this release.  It is a good HD transfer from a good quality print, nothing more or less, other than very good remastering of the score and a new 5.1 mix. I understand that, at the time he made it, Moroder was forced to print flaws in the then-available footage into his negative, but even the opening titles added by Moroder have a lot of visible scratches and jitter (the image shaking, primarily in the vertical direction, usually due to worn sprocket holes in the film).  While I understand and respect that there was a conscious decision to present Moroder's restoration in it's original form, and it would extremely difficult to do much about earlier-generation damage printed onto the available copy, flaws due to wear in the Moroder print itself should have been corrected, and Kino has previously demonstrated masterful skill at doing so.<br /><br />So far I have only addressed this release from a technical standpoint, ignoring the fact that there is an entire generation of people who have never seen and heard this version of Metropolis.  I can't give you any objective guidance, as I am a fan of both versions of this film.  I will at least point out that, while he did take some artistic liberties with tinting, titling, and scoring, Moroder's was an earnest and impressive effort to restore the film and it's story as much as possible with the resources available to him at the time. In fact, it was the most complete and coherent presentation of Lang's film available until a beautiful restoration made and screened in 2002, and released on DVD in 2003. For the 1980's audience, Moroder's version was more a entertaining and comprehensible presentation, and for many people, may remain so today.<br /><br />If you are watching Metropolis for the first time, which restoration to choose primarily depends upon your sensibilities regarding the score. Choose the Moroder for an excellent 1980's pop and rock score, and a shorter run-time. Choose the first Kino restoration (2003) for the original orchestral score, consistently high visual quality, and a very helpful and interesting commentary track.  Sadly, the more complete, if inconsistent, 2010 Kino restoration omits a commentary track.  Ultimately, I recommend seeing all three, but I am far from objective about this film.<br /><br />There is an arguably better fan restoration of the Moroder version for those who seek it out, but you will want to buy this one as well anyway.If you are watching Metropolis for the first time, which restoration to choose primarily depends upon your sensibilities regarding the score.

The version on this cd is longer than the 45 vinyl record of it that I still own after all of these years, and even more lovely.<br />It brings me right back to the first time that I heard it on the radio so many years ago.<br />I highly recommend this CD.

B005DKLPQ0|4.0|here's the breakdown:  4 albums, 3 compilations, and 1 live album all remastered quite well. the mp3 version and collector box contains extra songs not on the 8 cd set. the smiths needed to be remastered and they did a very fine job. the bad: you will be buying many songs twice.  'louder than bombs' has all of the tracks from 'the world won't listen' except for 6 songs, two of which are different mixes, one of which, the \\"US mix\\" of \\"you just haven't earned it yet, baby\\" which was on 'louder than bombs' has not been omitted altogether. 'louder than bombs' also has the singles [except for \\"how soon is now?\\"], one peel session track, and b-side tracks from 'hatful of hollow.'  furthermore, there are other peel session tracks, alternate mixes, and live cuts once available as b-sides that are absent. after buying this set, i found myself scrounging around for mp3s of those absent songs. 'rank' originally excluded several songs from the concert; it would've been nice to have those songs as bonus tracks.  i can appreciate rhino trying to be faithful to the original releases, but when three of those releases are just compilation albums, it really doesn't make sense. what should have been done: include the 4 albums, 'rank' and a 2-3 cd compilation combining 'louder than bombs,' 'hatful of hollow,' and 'the world won't listen,' and those extra b-sides to save us from having to buy the same songs twice.

B0055Q5F36|5.0|I'm not a professional reviewer, nor am I a techie. I'm a stay at home mom of 3 kids who's got a husband in construction. We buy an Otterbox for all of our phones. AT&T is our carrier.<br /><br />The case fits PERFECTLY. The screen protector does not, however its not a big deal. If you really can't stand it, go and pick up some of those peel and stick protectors and copy the layout of this one (totally a peel and stick version anyway). I got my phone from Costco for $99 after their coupon and they even gave me some screen protectors along with an accessory package as well for free. Originally, just to see I used the pattern of Otterbox's original peel n stick cover over the free ones I got from Costco (exactly the same quality) and used that, but eventually I just peeled it off. The phone's gorilla glass is awesome. I took it to the beach and even the tiny sand particles that get everywhere didn't do a thing to this glass, I couldn't imagine a screen protector doing anything else at this point in the phone's solid construction but get in the way of the crystal clear view. Most of the less starred reviews on this particular case are b/c the screen protector not fitting... I would like to point out, that the picture of the phone on the purchase page HAS that center button in plain sight so its not like they false advertised. This item shouldn't be faulted for selling us what they advertised.<br /><br />Its a solid case for an awesome phone regardless of the screen protector. Leave it off folks--this case plus the phone's gorilla glass is protection enough alone. Otterbox is a tried and true, no frills just solid protection kind of case. You just can't go wrong.

1597371270|1.0|I endured through the entire audiobook because I finish what I start but this book had very little interest for me. First I think it's a chick book, one that women would find more interesting, second it's about a spoiled brat that thinks herself the world, with which most readers will not sympathize. Maybe the book was great in the time when it was published, but the style does not suit me for these reasons. The setting was not interesting for me: 18th century England in the countryside where nothing happens, where propriety is more important that authenticity and passion. The climax of the novel, like the contemporary English culture, is all too subtle for my taste and like the rest of the book lacks the drama that I expected from this supposed classic. In short I think other great books have lasted the test of time but this is certainly not one of them. It too easily loses your attention.

B003ITZBVS|4.0|First, some background information.  Batman has had four Robins over the years.  The first Robin, Dick Grayson, leaves Batman and later changes his crime-fighting name to Nightwing (with a new costume).  The second Robin was Jason Todd, who, well, you'll learn all about him from the movie (or from the other reviews.  Hey, just because all the other guys have spoilers doesn't mean I have to.)  Also, the Joker has had some slightly different origin stories over the years.  In some of the versions, he began his career as \\"Red Hood,\\"  wearing a red metallic helmet which completely covers his face.  He was wearing this hood when he fell into the chemical vat which changed his skin and hair color, so Batman never knew who he really was.<br /><br />The film begins with the Joker clobbering the Jason Todd Robin with a crowbar.  You don't actually see the crowbar hit Robin's head, nevertheless, this is a good reason for the movie to be rated PG-13, and you probably wouldn't want your younger kids to watch it.  Then a bomb goes off, and, um, we're in the present day of the film (many years later).  There's a new villain in town calling himself the Red Hood.  The major crime boss in Gotham is the Black Mask, and the Red Hood wants to take over his territory, apparently.  But that's not what's really going on...<br /><br />I'm not a Batman expert, and I haven't read the original comics the movie was based on, but this story seems self-contained and you don't really need any more background information than what I gave you above for the story to make sense.  The animation is pretty good (better in some places than in others, as is typical).  Regarding the voice actors, I think John Dimaggio does a great job as the Joker.  He steals every scene he's in (plus he gets most of the best lines).  Jensen Ackles does a good job as Red Hood.  Bruce Greenwood is adequate as Batman, and Neil Patrick Harris adds humor to Nightwing.  (I get this vibe that Batman wishes Nightwing would just go away, which makes their scenes together amusing.)<br /><br />I have two problems with the movie that keeps it from being a five star.  First, the Black Mask character just isn't very interesting.  Second, and more important, **slight spoiler** when Red Hood asks Batman The Big Philosophical Question towards the end of the movie, Batman's answer just doesn't quite work.  **end spoiler**<br /><br />For special features, there are trailers for Superman/Batman Apocalypse, Justice League: Crisis on Two Earths, Batman: Gotham Knight, Superman: Doomsday, The Lord of the Rings (Animated), the Jonah Hex motion comic, and Legend of the Guardians.their scenes together amusing.)

B002VPE1AW|5.0|The movie Avatar, is a movie based on colonization and how it effects the indigenous people. It starts out with a human filled scene of the star, former marine Jake Sully finding out his twin brother is dead, taking over his project, and turning a new leaf in his career becoming a indigenous people, in form only. Jake's mission is to earn the native's trust so he can get them to move their home so his colleagues can mine. The persuasion to move does not pan out. After learning the native's ways and falling in love, he instead decides to see through their eyes, and try to persuade his human colleagues to not get them to move. In the end, it turns into a war, with the natives winning eventually and the humans being sent back to earth, with only a select few to remain behind.   Avatar is a great example of World Religions, especially the chapter on indigenous people and their sacred ways. The indigenous people portrayed in the movie show the kinship with all creation as described in Living Religions. \\"Within the spiritually charged visible world, all things may be understood as spiritually interconnected.\\" (Pg. 43) For example, when the dog has to be killed to save Jake on his first night out in the wild, as well as when they kill for food, they pray over the body and thank the mother god.   The indigenous people in the movie also have a firm belief in the nature of life, the energy circle. They also have a Shamash, a woman that is the link between the spiritual world and the natural world.  Avatar portrays the woman like the Yoruba teaching story does through the Osun and the Power of Woman, portraying the woman \\"...her womb is the matrix of all life in the universe...she is the leader of the...powerful beings and forces in the world.\\" (Pg. 43)   Throughout the movie, one cannot help reflect on the past history and how much the movie relates to many cultures throughout the centuries and what they must have gone through. All in all, this is a very powerful movie and brings to the forefront the ignorance the technology advanced culture has when it comes to the earth and the oldest beliefs and traditions. Jake even comments during the movie, when talking to the indigenous tribe, that they (the Americans) have killed their mother and they are going to do the same to yours. Quite possibly, Avatar is sending us the simple message to be thankful and acknowledge the little things around you, that we are all interconnected.  Could that be right and we just have forgotten it in our need for advancement?  Sources Cited: Fisher, Mary Pat. Living Religions, New Jersey: Prentice Hall, 2007, 8th ed.

0062082353|5.0|The book is well paced and well written.  A very interesting and honest view of the life, from childhood, of a true warrior.  You will learn much about the weaponry used, the gear used and the tactics employed in Iraq in the mid-2000s.  Kyle is very honest in his opinions of military brass and politicians.  He is on target in this regard.  The interwoven writings of his wife Taya provide a real perspective of the wives who sacrifice so much as their warrior husbands are off serving the United States of American.  Amazing are the distances of kills which were \\"everyday\\" work....one cannot believe a 2100 yard hit!!!  Great work Chris and Taya and thanks for all you have done for our country.

0425112039|5.0|I went into this book with very high expectation's, not only because of the very high rating's on amazon, but also because i've read and found many a Dean Koontz reader claiming it to be his best on different website's.<br />  At the beginning of the week, i found myself having a very hard choice between this and \\"From the Corner of his Eye\\"....i started Watcher's because i've known about it longer and always had it in the back of my mind to read.  I figured that maybe after i read 50-100 pages i could switch to \\"Corner\\" and then alternate back and forth for a while. Needless to say, i had no such urge to switch reading this book. Wacther's has an EXCELLENT beginning which set's off one of Koontz best novel's, no doubt!<br />  A few things that i loved about this book, besides the awesome dog, was that the character's were developed sufficiently for you to attach to them. Also, several interesting plot line's were going on, with all of them finished off (i've read other book's where he leaves a loose end or two).  Even the character's who are in the book for a few pages seemed necessary to be a part of this story.  The book had equal amount of slow(meaning character/relationship development) and fast (exciting/suspenseful) parts.  Therefor the pace was perfect.  I'm not a huge science fiction fan, but when it's Koontz, it doesn't even seem like a genre.<br />  There was some horror, and i loved the first half of the book, although the second half was very very good as well.  I like that you have to read to pretty much the very last word to know how everything turns out.  Add another 5 star rating to a well deserved book.  Wacther's is excellent, and i'm having trouble deciding if i would put this number 1 over \\"The Bad Place\\", but either one deserve's the spot.  6 out of 5 stars!

0439023513|2.0|If you've read through a decent five or so post apocalyptic manga series, you understand what I mean. This series follows the trend exactly. Look at the facts:  -A smaller scale problem evolves into \\"The world is in jeopardy!!!!\\" position.  -As a part of the final battle, numerous character drop off the scene like flies (Ha- think Harry Potter)  -Freaking mutant monster mutt crap. Something considered over-the-top in the novel's realm is introduced. Irrelevant. Unnecessary. But this sudden sci-fi monster thing is included in every major post-apocalyptic series. I don't know why. All it serves to do is throw my perception of the novel's reality off course.  -Good guy ends up being a bad dude. Oh yup. Saw it coming. Yes. When it seems like everything is about to end, ALWAYS, ALWAYS a bizarre, shortly introduced/lived final boss pops out of nowhere that you have to take out.  Counting the number of manga series I've been through that followed the same trend: Angel Sanctuary...Alive...Mirai Nikki...Full Metal Alchemist...etc...  I feel duped. Why in the world did I finish the series?  Outside of general plot structure complaints, oh that romance...I mean the lack thereof when I say that.  [SPOILER] Katniss justifies her relationship with Peeta by saying that Gale was much too violent (Ha. Now that I look back, that's where these awkwardly inserted sentences about the two's character throughout the book came from.) when she doesn't even see Gale as he's been whisked away to the 2nd district. Facepalm.  The book was still definitely entertaining though.

0385534639|5.0|Wow. This book was not what I was expecting at all and instead turned out to be one of the best I have read so far this year.  The story revolves around two characters that are in a challenge with one another, a magic challenge that uses a traveling circus as the venue.  The circus is filled with characters that you will love, the magicians are in love and you pull for them.  The story jumps around from character to character until the challenge is done - and let me tell you it is worth getting there for.  Like no other book you will read this year!

Initially, the cover would not close all the way but after a few days, it fully closed.  Still, I would like a strap just because I'm afraid that when I travel, the screen might get scratched by items working their way under the cover.  Of course, I'll probably just go to an arts and crafts store and buy something myself.  I would definitely recommend.

B006O5Y0SS|1.0|I am really not sure why people loved this movie...I thought it was so predictable in terms of plot and had awful acting. The portrayals of famous writers/artists was so ridiculously bad and overdone; it was like an extreme caricature rather than good acting. Watching this was a waste of 2 hours!

1848566980|4.0|Chris Foss is a very talented painter, both in imagination and technical execution.  I could rave about his art, but I'd just be repeating what other reviewers have said already.  This book includes every one of his paintings I'd ever seen, plus dozens, maybe hundreds I'd never seen before.  The glossy reproductions are exquisite, so even the small pictures show great detail.  And there are a lot of pretty small pictures, as another reviewer pointed out.  But almost every one of the famous pieces, and the ones that are favorites of mine, gets nearly a whole page, or even a two-page spread.  To me, the only real problem with this book is the text.  Half of what makes books like \\"The Alien Life of Wayne Barlowe\\" and \\"Hardyware: The Art of David A. Hardy\\" the source of ongoing enjoyment is the background information they give on most of the paintings.  All we get in this book (besides the introduction) are the bare details of each painting, rotated 90 degrees, at the outer margins of the pages.  I'd love to know more.  I'd also love to be able to read the titles without turning the book or my head.  This is especially annoying when it's production art for films.  I'd like to know about Foss' involvement in the productions, whether any of his designs made it to the final stage, and so forth.  There are also paintings that I happen to know are of real-life locales and historical events.  There are military bases, battles, natural disasters, and other scenes from the real world, plus, paranormal incidents that have been reported or theorized.  It would be nice if the book provided some background on these.  At least a blurb.  There's also no index, and no clear pattern of organization.  In a 240 page book with probably close to 1,000 images, this is pretty inconvenient.  The bottom line is, Chris Foss is a great artist, and this book does a great job of showcasing his art (and not just his best art, pretty much all of it), but the text is seriously wanting.  I realize that including text would have made a long book even longer, possibly even multiple volumes.  But this clearly isn't for the casual Chris Foss enthusiast anyway.  The editors/publishers went to great lengths in making this book, but I wish they'd gone the whole nine yards.

B005XT10YS|4.0|I always look forward to Robert Redford's work because his work shows such a powerful commitment to quality work in every area of the movie making process. It is also true for this too.  Since the title is 'The Conspirator' not plural, I knew it was going to focus on one person. I like the point of view from the lawyer defending Mary Surratt. It allowed one to see the turmoil this Union Soldier, turned lawyer was facing in the hysteria. It shows how easily people will allow themselves to be manipulated by unquestionably believing published newspaper articles about others or incidents. Hopefully we will be evolving out of that stupidity sooner than later.  I do wish there would have been more mention at the beginning or ending of the movie if what happened in the movie was based on fact, transcripts, stories, newspaper articles etc., or if it was mainly fictional.  The cast was great in their roles.  It showed very clearly the political environment and how people are manipulated or forced into wrong action and others in power willingly choose it to just look good.

B003Y5H4Y8|2.0|A great cast, but the story seems one-sided. Paints a picture of Jews who were victims of the holocaust as weak, helpless, going freely into capture. Doing nothing to fight for freedom.  The portrayal of the Nazi war criminal was chilling, well-done, showing a cold, heartless, unapologetic human undermining his captors by honing in on their weaknesses.  Much of the story was sappy, over dramatic. The ending was also painfully sappy, over dramatic.  Maybe the point of view was what was intended.

The script by John Gatins (based on Matheson's story as well an earlier screenplay by Dan Gilory and Jeremey Leven that the bulk of this film is drawn from)creates memorable characters and gives Jackman and his co-stars good material to work with.<br /><br />The Blu-ray looks marvelous with a richly detailed presentation.

B002VWNID6|5.0|A classic film with Kevin Kaustner and Morgan Freeman. When they go together, you can only expect the best. I think that this film is much better than the new Robin Hood which came out since.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|The game is effective for those who wish to disctract themselves from the world for thirty and on minutes. Have fun :)
B004MC8CA2|3.0|I like all the different versions and the Bible reading plan. lots of chapters have the first verse repeated in the beginning of the chapter. wish it could be read offline. don't always have Internet available. other than that, great app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game I play it every day. I love it. there is a lot of games I play on here.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 Games is a really fun and addictive game.  I can't put it down. I highly recommend it to everyone.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the best game ever because it has so many cool game keeper me busy for hours!!! get it!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I agree with the other positive reviews. I had to contact customer support for a software problem unrelated to the USB-RS232 converter. They were prompt and helpfull. This adapter works great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great app, play it all the time, i. oozy it everyday, it has some good challenges but some super easy ones
B005HI4LLY|5.0|As long as you're expecting this to be a stupid comedy involving random misadventure, you will be pleasantly surprised. It's well written, well shot, well acted, and enjoyable. I'm hoping for a series of Tucker and Dale vs. X.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|the games are pretty. basic, but it kills time.  games get points, but i don't like the touchscreen controls for some of them.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|Great movie, you must have it!!! If you really like Celine Dion, than don't stay anymore, take it, you'll love it!
B006H8BIIM|5.0|This game is an excellent defence game and has 3 survival mode which keep you hooked on playing over and over. not bad for $2.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love it! must buy and very enjoyable. great pastime.  my favorite app truley.. graphics need work tho, but its free spool....
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|The Fire supports PDF but for lengthy text heavy docs, it's annoying to zoom in and zoom out with every page flick. Adobe Reader has a continuous view that lets me zoom in and scroll down like a long web page.  No markup features or anything but that's not whet I was.looking for so I'm happy.
B004EFYZ1C|5.0|Downloaded this as a FAotD. Great deal. It provides detailed information about the moon phase, as well as a beautiful, detailed image in the main app. Loads quick, no issues on my HTC Amaze (Gingerbread 2.3.4). Turning on the detailed shadows brings the image alive....<br /><br />But wait there's more -- you can interact with the image, dragging the phase and seeing what day that will be. Changing the date to go forward or back in time. Dragging the image to see the dark side of the moon. It's fun!<br /><br />But wait there's more -- Moon Phase Pro provides a Live Wallpaper that turns my HTC Sense lock screen into a changing image of the moon. (It's a shame to hide it under home screen widgets and icons.)<br /><br />But wait there's more -- the app gives you several dynamic home screen widgets, with or without data at a tap. So much for that last bit. ;) )<br /><br />I like this app, and heartily recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|games r ok but my 14 yr old had to explain how to play them to me..were quite confusing...but he enjoys playing them.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|The weather alerts allow for multiple settings which is great for hiking and motorcycle riding. This is my favorite weather application
B0068TL23G|5.0|The premise here is about as simple as you can get.  Trace a line from one dot to another dot of the same color, while making sure that none of the colored lines cross.<br /><br />Sound simple??  It is...for about the first five stages.<br /><br />After that it starts to ramp up the difficulty in a curve that I found fair but challenging.<br /><br />There are quite a few levels...it's been mentioned already that there are more than 16, that's only the first chapter...and as you progress you will run into some levels that it seems as if there is only one solution, which can lead to some trial and error.  However, that trial and error can be alleviated with careful planning and decision making.<br /><br />Overall, it's a very simple premise that is used excellently.  Great stuff.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Although some of the games are a bit difficult, I love the games and find them to be tons of fun!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This cover is like they say. It is lightweight  and easy to put on the Kindle. It has it's own stand and a strap to keep it closed. A well made item and would reccommend it.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|most of the games are fun. a few stupid ones but mostly good. some are very addicting. I am pleased overall with the product.
B003AQBYUG|5.0|This is one of the premier values in the Blu-ray market today. Let's forgo discussing film, transfer and packaging quality for a moment. The fact one can purchase these for movies in a 'foreign\\" package at such a phenomenal discount is astounding. The quality of the films, while a matter of taste, have set a standard for a horror franchise. The audio and transfer quality are of the highest quality. I actually saw goosebumps on the backs of Ripley's thighs as she got dressed in the shuttle at the end of \\"Alien.\\" The packaging, while slick, is fairly pedestrian and sans bells-and-whistles, but, if you want the Alien Anthology, this is the one you want.
B003UESJFG|5.0|I never wanted to see this movie when it came out but one day we got it \\"On Demand\\" from our cable company for free so I put it on for my toddler...and he loved it.  He watched it all the time until they removed it so now we own it.  I know he doesn't care but I enjoy it much more with Blue Ray quality.
B001R60ESE|5.0|Chris Botti does an amazing job playing the trumpet. Anyone who enjoys jazz should purchase this.<br /><br />In my opinion Steven Tyler alone made this concert worth purchasing. Katharine McPhee's brilliant \\"I've Got You Under My Skin\\" performance spiced up the concert a whole lot. (Sultry and flirty!)<br /><br />Yo-Yo Ma's performance of Cinema Paradiso was amazing, the combination of cello and trumpet was beautiful.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />Side Note: I think I'm in love with Katharine now.
B0068TL23G|5.0|\\"Router\\" is a circuit puzzle where your goal is to connect identically colored points with continuous lines without any of the lines crossing or overlapping each other. This type of puzzle has long been popular in paper puzzles, where you draw the lines with a pencil. \\"Router\\" simply makes it much easier to draw lines or undo lines.<br /><br />There are nine chapters to work through. Chapter 1 is really a learning chapter, as the puzzles aren't too hard. I'm about to finish Chapter 2, and the puzzles have gotten noticeably more challenging, with as many as a dozen points to connect. To earn the highest scores, you're not just trying to make the connections, you're trying to make them with the shortest possible paths. If your path is longer, you won't get the maximum five stars for that screen. You can ask for hints, but every hint will cost you a star, so resort to using hints only when you're really stuck.<br /><br />The game graphics are colorful and attractive, and they look great on my Kindle Fire. The game settings allow you to turn the sound on/off and to adjust how the puzzle screens appear.<br /><br />Overall, Router is a superb transition of the old paper circuit puzzles to a digital device. If you enjoy this kind of puzzle, Router should keep you happily occupied for a while.
B005HSG3VK|4.0|I've only had it for about a month but love the fact that it makes the Kindle not so slippery when you just lean it against something.  I do wish it worked both vertical and horizontal though. Good protection. Love the color.
B003K16P3M|4.0|The only reason that I gave this 4 stars is because the other book in this series, Fire was a 5 star book.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|For people who love all kinds of music - this is the concert you're looking for!  From Andrea Bocelli to Blake Shelton...these singers are here because they're here to sing! This is not some auto-tuned concert, this is how a concert should be!  DTS HD made it 10 times better!  Highly recommended!
B001BKVWYG|5.0|We just had the great enjoyment of watching \\"Waiting for Sugarman\\" at the 2012 Sundance Film Festival.  This documentary tells the lovely story of Rodriquez, his music and popularity in South Africa, and reveals what a truly special personality he is.  Whoops ... didn't mean to spoil it.  There were rumors that he had died a horrible death, perhaps on stage, perhaps a suicide by gunfire or self-immolation.  The good news is that's not true.  Indeed, at the end of the movie, we had the incredible experience of seeing Rodriquez in person!  His music, his story and his personality are inspiring.  Get the music, and see the movie if you can!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Super cover, doesn't add much weight to the reader, easy flip around cover with elastic band to hold cover in place, makes holding the cover much easier, I would highly recomend this product. RK
B0054JZC6E|5.0|the games are great and some are very challenging if you dont get addicted I would be surprised! I like you earn the game and they are for any age
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun game but a bit childish. its a great game tot free. it will keep u busy tor along time. most games need more points.
B0060AY6FO|4.0|There were so many negative reviews on this book that I almost didn't read it. I'm glad I gave it a chance. Just as in an Austen novel, there are numerous characters, several sub-plots, and much worrying about keeping up proper appearances and avoiding scandal at all costs, even when there's a murder in your woods and a black sheep relative is implicated. The Austen style, including the subtle humor, felt very authentic to me, and I also thought the mystery was well-plotted. Maybe expectations were higher for all those who gave negative reviews, but I throughly enjoyed my reading of the book.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|Worked fine on my Xoom till I updated to pics now it freezes and force quits every 2-5 mins :(
B001IF5YLQ|1.0|I purchased this adapter to connect a second monitor to my MBP and it fit loosely, causing a sporadic loss of connection. The monitors would flash blue over and over again. It's annoying enough to make the pope cuss.  I would have returned it but I made the foolish mistake of trying to tighten the gap using pliers...... That and I ended going mental, completely destroying the stupid thing. I bought a KANEX iAdaptdvi Mini DisplayPort to DVI-D Adapter for $10 and been happy ever after.  In defense for Apple, the DisplayPort adapter on my Mac Mini at work works perfectly. Don't know the actual product number but it has a much longer wire. As for this little POS, save a few bucks and go generic.
0446556750|3.0|Having read a number of Connelly's works for the past month I don't think he put a lot of effort into writing this one. The story line has little if any mystery to it right from the beginning. Harry Bosch is the only mysterious person in the whole book because the killer is revealed early on and he has few secrets that Harry uncovers as he goes. Most of the action is at the very end of the book and that is another manhunt for the killer.  If you like to read about courtroom decorum and procedures then you will likely enjoy this book. However if you are looking for a book with some suspense and action this in not your cup of tea. I'm also a bit troubled by the way the author leaves the end of the book open to guess work by the reader. Where is Harry Bosch off to with a piece of evidence he has found while digging for a missing person in a canyon? The author may try to connect this up in the next edition, I don't know, but it does sort of leave the reader in the lurch and makes for a hole in the storyline with detective Bosch.  Overall I could not decide if this was a decent book or not. From a mystery point it isn't, from an action point it isn't, but from following a court case it is okay. I'd prefer more action and mystery rather than courtroom posturing and pleadings. You be the judge when you read it, I'm on the fence on this one.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It is a good app for the kindle fire. easy game play, and a good time waster. the only annoying thing is the add before each game. But - hey, it's free, so I shouldn't complain.
B002RL7VKC|5.0|My son got this tractor for his 1st birthday. He loved playing with the dog and farmer and pushing it around the room. He is now 21 months old and has been playing with it on almost a daily basis. The trailer comes apart and is great for fine motor skills as he practices pulling it apart and putting it back together and then connecting it to the tractor. He also has the farmer play with the dog and puts them in the tractor and trailer. A great feature is that the scoop on the front of the tractor removes, so if you just want the basic vehicle, your little one can play with that first. We love it and would recommend it to anyone!
B005V1WVPA|4.0|When I heard the first single for this album, I was intrigued.  I like some dub-step, and I like some Korn, so I figured I'd probably like this.  Turns out I was right.  Some of the tracks I instantly liked, like Narcissistic Cannibal and Get Up, but some others I wasn't really digging.  But after a couple of replays, they started to grow on me.  Now I just keep listening to it over and over.  It's a huge departure for Korn, but it's not like their last few albums were that great anyway.  The fusion of Korn and dub-step works well and there are some really catchy tunes here.  If the thought of dub-step in your Korn makes you want to vomit, this album won't change your mind.  But if the concept has you interested, you should buy it.  You won't be disappointed.
B00000255F|5.0|Tonight in Jungleland : A Review<br /><br />Epics are always tricky to pull off in art.  If one's vision is too small, the work seems cramped and stunted, like children playing in adult clothes. If one's<br />Vision is too large it seems ponderous and self important. The artist must be<br />Sure his talent meets his scope and that he can communicate it. It is truly a<br />Tight rope walk, the ground very far below. Bruce Springsteens' song Jungle Land succeeds on all accounts, partly because Bruce knows when to<br />Roar and when to whisper, and partly because of his unfaltering trust in<br />The E Street band to get it right. The song is orchesteral and cinematic, explosive<br />And restrained.  The light teasing of violins and piano lead us in, invoking summer. The strings leave off but the piano continues, marching right up<br />To the mic with Bruce as he begins to sing and the images begin, full of<br />Familiarity and a rugged grandur.<br /><br />They come from West Side Story and On The Waterfront and Bruce's own<br />Growing up in South Jersey. The mood is celebratory, exuberant and inclusive....\\"The Rangers had a home coming in Harlem late last night..\\"<br />The excitement builds as the guitars slash in, and drums infusing<br />The moment with expectation as Bruce invokes both God and the Law as<br />He sweeps his arm and sings \\"From the churches to the jails all is silence<br />In the world\\" ( who else in all of rock has a lyric like that?) and then in the<br />Next line reminding us all of what is to believe in SOMETHING he says<br />\\"As we take our stand down in jungleland.\\" And we are off.<br /><br />There are not many songs like this, not in all of music let alone rock. Not many that take us in and return us to youth again, not with nostalgia but with<br />Purpose, even if that purpose is to remember who we are again. Springsteen<br />Bears witness to the importance of risk and love and indentity, to the heated<br />Intensity of kissing that girl and hearing that song and dancing that dance.<br /> all the riturals and extremes of the young. The song carries us, secure,<br />giving us the freedom to remember again and not feel silly about it.<br /><br />It is interesting that Bruce is the narrator, not the participant, in the song. So<br />It truly is cinematic as he feeds us the images. They are new to him as they are to us. The song starts to cook, the band falling in behind Bruce as his voice wrangles and stretches and evokes forth the words. They are metaphoric and totemic more than realistic,,everything bigger than life,<br />Graced with import and the feeling of impermanence. Bruce sings as if he is seeing everything from inside a car driving by, everything fleeting and half<br />Shrouded in darkness, not tangible. The saxophone and guitars push the song<br />To it's limits, driving it higher and higher. Stevie Van Zant doing more with<br />A thirty second solo than most guitarists do in a life time. Bruce's voice still<br />Painting the night with excitement and passion, seeing with his heart..and then.... everything slows and Clarance starts his solo. The sound is beautiful<br />And haunting, stately and wild. The notes go on and on like sailing down a<br />River, like sunrise, like the feeling of belonging. Then it slows and he stops playing and there is a sense of arrival.  The band narrows down to only organ and piano and then only piano, tentatively playing two notes in<br />Repetition,,,slow and soft,, soundling like nothing so much one as trying to touch<br />One's lovers' face in the dark. It continues and Bruce sings....<br /><br />Beneath the city<br />Two hearts beat<br />Soul Engines running through<br />A night so tender<br />In a bedroom, locked<br />And whispers are soft<br />Refusal,,and then,,,,surrender<br />And the piano is trickeling and we learn The Rat has been killed , shot in a tunnel up town With no one there to care, And the light goes out in the lovers room and Bruce sings coda and the song fulfills its' true arc going<br />From innocence to tragedy, epic fulfilled, and the night indifferent,,,the song<br />Leaves you to wonder if it was the police who killed the Rat or someone else. Certainly no other song on Born to Run includes so many references<br />To the police, and in both Born to Run and Thunder Road Springsteen is the<br />Protagonist, not the outside narrator as here. In no other song by Bruce does<br />A person pay as high a price for risk as the Rat does here. Perhaps Jungleland was Springsteen's reconition that youth is fleeting and that he had known too many people like The Rat who had come to a bad end,,,<br />Maybe,,,maybe not,,,,one thing is sure,,,Bruce gave us an epic,,,long<br />May he sing..

B000Q67DEO|4.0|The CD / DVD came in a timely fashion.  Previous reviews from other people warned the audio quality on the DVD was not up to par.  We weren't disappointed at all.  The quality was actually pretty good.  All in all a good value.  We haven't heard or seen this DVD since the 80's.  How nostalgic is that?  Thanks for making this combo available.
0425221806|5.0|I can't say that I was surprised that this novel turned out to be amazing. After all, out of all of his remarkable works, this one seems to be the most adored by his fans. Virtually everyone knows the premise of this tale, so I won't go into detail in that regard (I never do anyway). But I will say that Koontz demonstrates his ability to enthrall the reader, scare him, and pull the heart strings when he's most vulnerable. This isn't my standalone favorite Koontz novel, but it's definitely in my top three. In my opinion, his latest efforts are more plot-driven; in his heyday, however, as with Watchers, his books were more character-driven. I happen to enjoy both styles, as I am in awe of his evolution as an author.  You don't need me to tell you that you should read Watchers, because I'm sure you've heard of the magic therein. But if you haven't read it, what are you waiting for?
B0068TL23G|5.0|This one is staying on my phone. Fun and easy time waster that's truly worth playing. I guess simpler is better sometimes!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I loved this game. my daughter an I play together for hours. I highly recommend it. so many fun games for free I would have paid for it.

B004XVMCMQ|3.0|Never read a book before you see the movie. This movie leaves out some very important points, that are important to the story that give you a much better understanding and the full impact of the story.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|Love this app, is a accurate as Mark Eubank! Never had a problem, love the Earthquake info. Integrates well on the My Touch 4G - HTC Glacier
B004EPZ08Y|5.0|I'm sure not everyone likes this series, but if you are a fan of the Final Destination series of movies, this one is one of the best.  My wife and I saw this one in the theater, and the 3-D effects were spectacular.  Unfortunately that does not translate to the DVD/Blu-ray version. Still, the movie is enjoyable and has a fairly believable story line. The bridge collapse scenes are spectacular.  The ending was very surprising.  I won't ruin the movie by giving the ending away.
B0068TL23G|2.0|not hard, got through first chapter in about 10 minutes with 5 * on each level and wasn't interested in bothering to continue. nowhere near the ports of Simon tathams puzzles which are by far the best puzzle games for Android.
B000000OPQ|4.0|When Saturday Night Fever came out in 1977, the the \\"song track\\" album had come of age. It was followed up with the \\"Grease\\" soundtrack.  Even though Grease was the score to a Broadway show it had been arranged by Olivia Newton John's producer., John Farrar, and Robert Stigwood's team of record makers to sound like the hit album that it was. Then we were treated to the hit film and television show \\"Fame\\" with Irene Cara, and that soundtrack album spun off another major top 40 smash hit. Add the soundtracks to \\"Flashdance\\" and \\"Footloose\\", and the race was on. Everyone wanted to cash in on the big bucks a good soundtrack album could bring in, and the boost that it could lead to a somewhat mediocre movie.<br /><br />The story of Vision Quest is a simple one. Hey high school wrestler starts doing crazy things to lose weight in order to compete with a rival at a close by high school. This includes starving himself to death and falling in love with an older woman who totally changes everything. The movie was mediocre at best but it did spin off one of the best Madonna songs ever released.<br /><br />\\"Crazy For You\\" was a ballad written by John Lynn and John Bettis (who had formerly worked with the Carpenters). There was a lot of hullabaloo over Madonna recording the track. Phil Ramon got involved, and there were some threatening conversations but finally Warner Bros caved in and allowed Madonna to be associated with the film. It really is the highlight of the soundtrack album, and the original mix of the song that appears on this album is worth the price of admission. On a later compilation, \\"Something To Remember\\" [[ASIN:B000002N3J Something to Remember]], which is a collection of Madonna's ballads, the song has been completely remixed and the drums don't sound the same. The version here really is the way it was intended to be heard before it was messed with.<br /><br />There are a few other enjoyable tracks on the album by Sammy Hager John Waite and Journey. Nothing to write home about, butbetter than what is on the rest of the album - the other six or seven tracks are simply that filler which is totally forgettable. Still I recommend this on the strength of the Madonna cuts. For six dollars you really can't go to wrong here.  On the whole, the album didn't produce but one song that charted, but for a collector of eighties music this is one to add to your collection.han what is on the rest of the album - the other six or seven tracks are simply that filler which is totally forgettable.

B004EPZ0BG|3.0|As far as rom-coms go, this one is pretty good. The interactions between Kunis and Timberlake are interesting and believable and I found myself really enjoying it until the cliched rom-com plot devices kicked in.  You know how this is going to end before it starts. By halfway through you know how it is going to come about. There's nothing new here. That said, it's a rom-com. It is what it is. Don't watch it if you're expecting something 'new' or 'different' but if you're looking for a classic rom-com, this is a good one to try.

But I did so to make this audio book the best experience possible, we need the Twilight cast to read to us!! Now that series I would buy!

0525478817|3.0|I find myself reading reviews of THE FAULT IN OUR STARS online, but while I enjoyed that book (I still need to reread it again),I can't help but wander over to reviews of LOOKING FOR ALASKA yearning to reread it for the 5th time.  I think the major difference was that I felt like LOOKING FOR ALASKA was mine, something I found and could cherish and analyze personally, while THE FAULT IN OUR STARS had to be shared, especially with those intimately linked to cancer (unlike myself).  Possibly it was the hype that made TFIOS not live up to my expectations, but I think that it was also missing something John Green-esque.  Something that questioned life and how we live it and how it will be when life ends.  I LOVE John Green and I think TFIOS for most was just what they were looking for, but for me it lacked a sense of relate-bility.  Why is it that when Augustus dies of cancer, Hazel (also with cancer) doesn't question death or life after death, as Miles does of Alaska in Looking for Alaska? Possibly because she too faces the same fate.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I like this game it is really addictive I am almost half way done with it and I got it last night
B004LUS390|2.0|this app was amazing until the update. now its totally screwed up. took me 7 tries to open it after the update and even when I got it opened the screen is split and its not calibrated at all anymore. now I'm just waiting for the next update to see if it will make it any better. my advice: buy it its an amazing app, just don't update it

B00008FRNH|3.0|I bought a few Toto albums back in the day. I particularly enjoyed the debut and IV. I played each of them quite a lot in the months after their release. However, when CDs made their appearance I was never inclined to acquire these record in the new format. Fast forward to 2012. My Car's CD player isn't working and I have to play the radio. As I flip from station to station on comes Hold the Line. Catchy song. So as soon as I get home I order these two CDs. They have now arrived and I have had the opportunity to listen to each three or four times and..............<br /><br />Well, first off, there is no denying that there is much talent on display here. The musicians are first rate, the vocalists are competent and the songs are infectious; a few are killers. I am enjoying my reunion with Toto, but (and this is Jennifer Lopez sized but), it all sounds like it was done in a \\"paint by numbers\\" way. It is soulless and formulaic. I always found Styx and Journey (after the first two LPs) To be similar. I have a few Styx albums and really enjoy some of that band's music. Similarly, I find Toto palatable and occasionally inspired. Nonetheless I have a suspicion that these two CDs will soon find there way into the stacks and will gather dust before I play them again.<br /><br />Each is entitled to his opinion. However, as much as I disagree with those who consider Toto IV one of the great records (and there are lots of you), I take issue with those who grant this just one star. Catchy and well- made pop does have it's place. It's just that if I want clinical, note perfect efficiency I'll turn to Steely Dan.
B003HKN52A|5.0|Thanks for the memories.........  The man was so talented, timeless and he's gone down in musical history as a icon of the 50's and his music has captured longevity beyond most other entertainers/singers of his era.  Truly Missed!  He would have been 75 years old had he lived.  Excellent DVD!  Any Elvis fan would appreciate to watch as we have several times.  Like hooking up with an old friend.

0446571415|4.0|Book 5, in the Camel Club series<br /><br />At first glance the sheer size of this book could be quite intimidating, its paperback version holds over 650 pages, enough to scare away some but definitely not the die-hard fans like myself.<br /><br />The story opens with Stone contemplating his next covert assignment while walking through Lafayette Park near the White House, suddenly machine gun fire fills the air and a bomb detonates narrowly missing the motorcade of the U.S. president and Britain's prime minister. Fearing the attack may be a botched assassination attempt, the authorities in charge quickly reassess Stone's mission, the overwhelming importance of what has just transpired has him assigned to assist British agent Mary Chapman of MI-6 to flush out the terrorists and their motives. You can always be sure that whatever Stone is involved his buddies at the Camel Club are never far behind.....<br /><br />The mystery moves through Washington's halls of power and eventually to the Bronx and on to Murder Mountain, West Virginia. Stone and his cohorts are faced with \\"nanobot\\" technology and the unknown magnitude biological weapons can have on a populated area. A Turkish professor supposedly on the trail of Osama bin Laden and a beautiful lobbyist who uses her assets to the max adds flair and intrigue to mystery, danger and excitement lurks at every corner.....<br /><br />Baldacci's forte is his skill at tight plotting, it rattles along at a great pace with many twists and red-herrings, the short chapters act like a pace maker in overdrive. The action is quite intense from the start. The storyline is a blast from start to finish it is not a fluffy read or a mystery that we can predict each move in advance. Mr. Baldacci continues to develop the well-known members of The Camel Club and has provided new characters which enhance tenfold the read, we will no doubt see them return in the future. This fifth installment provides enough background information to be read and enjoyed on its own.<br /><br />\\"Hell's Corner\\" is highly entertaining and one of my favourites, a definite plus to the series.s highly entertaining and one of my favourites, a definite plus to the series.

B002GZQY6Q|5.0|My wonderful friend Armands introduced me to PT, and I will be forevah grateful!<br /><br />I do not have words to describe the music!<br /><br />If you are a fan of otha prog rock (Can, Curved Air, Jethro Tull, Pink Floyd) you should have an understanding for this kind of thing.<br /><br />If you love music that mixes genres (Radiohead, Massive Attack, Portishead) you should also be able to understand Porcupine Tree very well, indeed.<br /><br />I simply ADORE Porcupine Tree.<br />Steven Wilson is a fabulous songwriter. The things he writes about are deeply moving and inspirational. Some of the songs are dark, and if that kind of thing bothers you, then look somewhere else.<br /><br />I love that some of the albums are just one long song. I am very patient with music.<br />If it is worth listening to in the first place, then take your time and get all the pleasure there is to be had---don't be in such a rush!<br /><br />Porcupine Tree will give you infinite pleasure.
140120841X|5.0|I bought this graphic novel as a huge fan of the movie, so I couldn't wait to read the original take on the story.  I also heard that Alan Moore hated the movie, which made the novel that much more intriguing.  First off, it's definitely different.  The best part about this novel and the movie is that they sort of work together in presenting the events.  In my opinion, the book absolutely captures the characters in a better way.  You really get a sense of who V is and his purpose.  It also offers a deeper look into the supporting characters.  On the other hand, I feel that the movie really expresses the tyranny of the government to a greater degree.  All in all, any fan of the movie or any avid reader should definitely give it a shot.  The artwork is great and the ideas and lines will stick with you for the rest of your life.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|I only gave it 1 star, not because I hate the game, but because I hate the fact it does not work on my phone.  the game randomly freezes and it locks up.<br /><br />Update: It works on Jelly Bean, which my phone is running now.

B005P3NPXG|3.0|On 2008's  [[ASIN:B001F290E4 Soul]], Seal went through the '60s soulbook with the assistance of producer David Foster.  For its 2011 sequel, Seal moves on a decade and brings in Trevor Horn to helm its 11 tracks (sometimes in conjunction with Foster and his cohort Jochem van der Saag), a result that perhaps freshens proceedings up a bit but doesn't change them markedly.  [[ASIN:B005P3NPXG Soul 2]] remains a faithful re-creation of classic soul, Horn applying a new coat of paint to the original arrangements, ensuring that this is a fresh, glistening environment for Seal.  The singer doesn't pop against this backdrop, he blends into his surroundings, sounding as immaculately tailored as the instrumentation, never pushing the tunes away from the melodies you know by heart.  While that might not make for especially compelling listening, it's certainly pleasant either as nostalgia or as high-end lifestyle music. S.T.

B004A8ZWVK|5.0|This movie was really good. I have watched it several times.  I got a great deal on this product, much better than I could find it in the brick and mortar stores. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys civil rights movies or movies with an old south theme.
B005LAIGGY|4.0|Saw it yesterday, can't stop thinking about it. Not the most perfect movie ever made, but certainly watchable and moves along at a rapid pace. Newcomer child-actor Thomas Horn did a fantastic job of acting as he had to run the gamut of heavy emotions, he being beset with a huge guilt that he has not the age experience to deal with, hence his tantrums and minor transgressions. Horn should have been nominated for an Academy Award. His explosionn of emotion towards Von Sydow's character of what he was trying to accomplish was the best scene in the movie and great acting by Horn. I predict a big future for him.  I'm not familiar with Foer's books, but found this story credible and I'd see this movie twice (unlike the sucky, sappy \\"War Horse\\" I saw only a month before.)  Great cinematography, a beautiful scene was of the NY sidewalk at night with everyone posting pictures of missing loved ones. The quiet dignity of those courageous survivors and I think I could actually feel the heat of the lit candles under the pictures. I felt as if I was there. Hanks and Bullock  barely have any screen time, but the job got done just the same.  For adults looking for some adult drama with all the adult perks (no superheroes, comic book, fairy tale or teen-aged vampire characters), this is a great way to spend an afternoon.  P.S. Just caught a movie today on TV \\"Everything is Illuminated\\" which is basically a biography of author Foer on his trip to the Ukraine to find out what happened to his grandfather at the hands of the Nazis. Directed and adapted to the screen very competently by actor Liev Schrieber from Foer's book. Both funny as hell and heart-breaking. Suggest you catch this one if you like Extremely Loud....
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quiet music, soothing sound effects, and a nice need for strategic thought make this a very playable game. a keeper.
B002ZG99TK|5.0|We loved this movie. No real bad guys, just a couple of fools. But the movie moves right along and keeps up the pace until the end. Denzel Washington is great as usual and the other actors all keep pace. I would recommend this movie to anyone, especially train lovers. The photography and the train sequences are first rate.
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I was a little disappointed to find out that the Fire did not have Tex-to-Speech enabeled;however, I was sure I could find an app to deal with this issue.  After going through every single free app that I thought could remotely help me find a solution, I came across ezPDF, and that's when my search ended.  I use it mainly to listen to books while I am commuting, so while the other drivers around me are angry because they are stuck in traffic, I am enjoyning my \\"lecture\\" straight from the Fire.  I can bookmark my pages, use it on night mode, and enjoy my TTS on the go.  It has some other features that I have not bother to check out yet, mainly because I do not need them.  All in all, I am very happy with my purchase.  (There is one more thing, the search button for document look-up does not want to work any more and I have to search manually for whatever document I need.  This can be anoying at times)  In conclusion, I love the app and would recommend it. (I still think that text-to-speech should be anable on the Fire though. Amazon, please, take note)
B005T87QCI|5.0|I like the game because u get to be all the bots from the movie and they all have special fighting techniques

0307655105|5.0|This is an absolute classic. I've bought it again as an adult because I have such incredibly fond and vivid memories of this book from my childhood. Looking at it now shows me how so many beautiful and traditional words I learned from this joy of a book. A must for all children.

B0053TMP24|5.0|this book was hilarious. I couldn't put the book down.I got engaged in this book enough to end up in trouble some times.
B0045HCJQW|5.0|I love this movie!! I think I've seen this movie about 100 times! I had it on VHS for many years, viewing it that way. When DVDs came out, it's one of the first ones I bought. The actors are SO good in their parts and the characters they play so interesting and funny, I still find myself smiling through most of it and even still laughing in others. I've played the other DVD so many times, I figured I'd better get a spare incase something happened to the original so bought this one for backup. I never want to be without this movie!
B000002MIB|5.0|I think this album rocks!!! The song selection is awesome. Plus the highly anticipated effects-laden live solo from bassist Michael Anthony. Drummer Alex Van Halen takes an aggravated drum solo following Pleasure Dome. 316 has a great solo from Eddie. Sammy's solo hits are a great supplement. This is the best live album EVER!!! If you love VH, buy this and enjoy!

B0054JZC6E|1.0|This game is a mix of emotions for me. I can pick out mabey two games that were actually fun. The other 117 were pointless. This game didn't give me any pleasure and is a game I wont reccomend.
B005C7SXMS|4.0|This coming-of-age British dramedy has some terrific performances by lead actor Craig Roberts and Yasmin Paige, who steals every scene that she is in.  The first half of the film focuses on these two, who play teenager Oliver Tate and the girl he becomes involved with.  Unfortunately, the second half is centered around the relationship between Oliver's mother (played by Sally Hawkins) and another man, which is much less interesting.  However, I still recommend the movie for its quirky and often amusing screenplay and Roberts and Paige's wonderful performances.
B003JSSPSY|1.0|I was really excited to purchase and watch this last box set of this TV series, so when it arrived I promptly made some popcorn and got a drink to sit down and watch it. Unfortunately the DVD's worked thru the first episode and then started to skip and freeze which of course ruined the experience of watching these final episodes of this great TV series...:(  I have written the seller more then once and receive NO response from them at all. I am very disappointed as I thought I had shopped wisely, the reviews were good there rating was great etc. Now I am stuck with a set of DVD's that I can not enjoy. DO NOT PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM THIS SELLER...Customer service is horrible to say the least and the DVD's do not work properly and its a waste of money .....
B006PZBR8S|5.0|This is a really fun movie. I am not a big fan of Mr. Jackman but I must admit he delivered a wonderful performance in this feel good movie. A fine mix of action and soft and gooey emotion to keep everyone entertained. Bravo!

B006NXIO0Q|4.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie. It surprised me. It is better than the normal super 100 lb chick kicking 200lb mens butt movies. It had a decent story line and some nice stunt work.

1451648537|5.0|Walter Isaacson's book about Steve Jobs is brutally objective. While Jobs was undoubtedly an extraordinary visionary in the digital media sector, he was also a deeply flawed individual personality-wise. But when we look at leaders in the media/computing business (e.g., Gates, Zuckerberg, Murdoch, Diller, Malone, Eisner), aren't they all difficult and (somewhat) ruthless in business? Can you be a leader and a nice man/woman at the same time? Not too many examples would support this association. I am teaching a course about strategic media management. I came to the conclusion that, while it would be difficult to use this book as a textbook in such a course due to organizational issues, this is the only book that students really need to read to understand strategic management using Apple as a case study. Wittingly or not, Isaacson was able to pull in all the major components of strategic management through the study of Jobs and Apple: culture, vision, innovations, strategies, objectives, leadership, motivation, performance, etc. Kudos to Isaacson for this formidable tour de force. Of course, the book is about the life of Steve Jobs and the history of Apple's innovations. But for me the most valuable aspect is the ad-hoc discussions of strategies within Apple. In a very real sense, \\"Steve Jobs\\" is a management book and one of the best I have read in years.

B005EGXTHG|3.0|After reading the Hunger Games in one night, I dove straight into Book Two: Catching Fire. I found this instalment to be good but not as great as the first. It was more of the same really, but moved with a much slower pace to begin with, basically repeated the middle preparation before the games only to finish off with a faster, more sci-fi, slightly crammed fight scene in the end. I would have much prefered a more natural battleground, like the first. As soon as the mutts and futuristic elements came in to play, I started to lose interest. Although that's just me. But like in the Twilight series, I found that the relationships between the characters were the main reason I turned the page. But bottomline, this was a good read ... just not when comparing it to the first.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B006OZY40W ZARKORA - The Fyrelit Tragedy]]

The first Defective product I ever got from Amazon.

0385738773|2.0|I recently came across the maze runner trilogy at my local library and I must say I enjoyed them ... at first. The first two books were great and even the third one was fine until the end, and I finished them in quick succession.  When I reached the final book I was excited to find out who Thomas was and how the cure would be discovered, unfortunately neither of these issues were addressed. Thomas conveniently decides not to get his memories back fearing that he will become the person he was before the maze. Not only that but what really frustrated me was that there was no cure. The Munies are sent away to some insignificant island to sit and wait for the rest of humanity to die. Thomas does not die a heroic death having his brain cut open for the good of humanity, and the hope that his death would not be necessary is a false one.  I also found that Teresa died at too convenient a moment, saving Thomas' life and dying in the process, thereby removing the second girl and leaving Thomas free to \\"hook-up\\" with Brenda. Although this was necessary and expected, it happens too quickly and hurriedly to fit nicely into the flow of the book.  All in all, the series as a whole merits 3 and possibly a half stars, but the disappointment caused by the lack of answers in this last book leaves the poor rating.
