B005HEDI3K|5.0|Absolutely brilliant remastered episodes!  I would dare say they are better visually than the originals ever were.  An absolute must watch for Trekkie's!
B004MNO0BQ|4.0|Took a while to get use to the movement, but this was excellent for finger / eye coordination and the laser glow & sound are Top Notch!
B00BVYKWJI|4.0|My husband and our parents have really enjoyed watching the Borgias.  We like to watch historical series and we thought that the actors were pretty talented.  There are some bloody scenes, so I have had to look away for some parts, but I would still recommend watching it.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|This is one of the best concerts of all time, the Eagle's gives you everything they made and a whole lot more... their harmony and great playing has not missed a beat ..I highly recommend this concert and get it in Blu ray!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|It really strikes home ! So many issues & emotions dealing with everyday life & family are addressed. Lots of the &#34; stuff &#34; we don't  often let ourselves go back to - Sparks gives you those gentle invites to walk down those paths of resolution & healing with him.<br /><br />Thank you Nicholas
B000NTPDSW|5.0|The greatest movie hands down!, the Blu- Ray was not as tight as some Blu-ray,  not much difference in the quality of movie from dvd, but still great trilogy
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I could not review because the app did not work on my trio tab, there were roughly 14 games that were installed on the tab but only 3 of them installed and worked. The other acted like they installed but they did not.
B002V9PEUE|5.0|A very good Stallone movie with a lot of exciting parts, great mountain scenes and great story line....a good movie
B009MYAQK4|3.0|A collection of simple wisdom to live by told by a text on papyrus the words of a Copt. told to a gathering of the people of Jerusalem prior to the attack of the French during one of the Crusades.<br />A gentle reminder of how to live a mindful life.
B006BFK5DK|5.0|Great album for die hard fans of Earth Wind & Fire.  Love the Guiding Lights and My Promise tracks.  Great Album.  Buy this!!
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|I love this case.  It works great and is very portable.  If I keep the bluetooth in it while not using it, chances are I will not loose it!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I started watching this series, and I can't wait for more episodes.  I never thought I would be this interested in a drama.
B0015RFCZ0|4.0|Sweet movie, sometimes a little slow but just the right thing for a quiet evening at home and the music is lovely.
B00DBSZJRM|3.0|Entertaining, but not that great of a plot, character development, etc.  Good special effects and vivid photography.  What more can I say.
1400069289|5.0|Wonderful storytelling permeates this book. I could barely put it down and look forward to reading more from this author.
B005LJITS0|3.0|Hard to take Ryan Reynolds as a superhero, especially as Green Lantern, who is usually depicted as a serious hero. Hopefully, the rivalry with Sinestro gets played up in the sequel.
B00BR476TG|5.0|Excellent storyline, the main actor does a wonderful job. Refreshing, suspenseful and adventurous! You will not be disssaointed. I will definitely be watching again.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|The character development in this story has depth that I enjoyed. You begin to feel you know these women  and like them in spite of all their flaws. A refreshing change for me discovering this author, I plan to read all of her other books.
1400097029|5.0|I'm dismayed to see this book with only three and a half stars on Amazon, and I think it's because of the hype. When a book gets as much acclaim as this one did, people feel pressured to read it, people who shouldn't be reading it - for any number of reasons, no condescension intended. And when it doesn't do for them what they think it should, they lash out.<br /><br />So let's state right up front: this book is not an \\"easy\\" read. It's not even challenging in the way literature often is, although the prose does require some patience, and some slowing down and digesting from time to time. It was difficult for me, personally, to read, because it is about death. Death, loss, grieving, it is a lengthy meditation on all of these subjects and it puts on no airs regarding redemption or spirituality or anything so rosy. It's pragmatic and blunt and does not coddle you. We're all going to die, it'll probably be horrible, and that will be the end. We'll just disappear forever. This is never an easy subject, and besides that, it's Irish literature, so naturally a gloomy, overcast pall hangs over the entire thing (the upcoming film version, judging from the trailer, looks excellent, but far too sunny). I would even describe this novel as frequently dreary. Can a \\"dreary\\" book be good?<br /><br />Well of course it can. First of all, the dreariness is broken up reasonably often by some really excellent dark, dry humor. Secondly, the flashbacks to the main character's childhood encounters with the Grace family are interesting in their sort of sinister foreboding. There must be a reason more than simply revisiting the location for why he's thinking so much about these people from that time, so long ago... mustn't there? What happened to this family he knew for a single summer which causes them to be so relevant now? There is subtle but well-crafted suspense there which gradually grows into a kind of dread. Finally, the true measure of any work of art is not whether it makes you feel \\"good\\" after having experienced it. The measure of art's worth is: does it accomplish what it set out to do? And in my opinion, The Sea does. It does this more effectively than most novels I've read. The total immersion into the main character's world; the baffling, harrowing mood swings he experiences (shown more than told); the intrigue regarding the Grace family and that hazy, haunting summer so long ago; and most of all the way Banville ties everything together thematically at the end... it all adds up to a phenomenally successful novel, one that rewards careful examination and perseverance.<br /><br />This story is not meant to be \\"fun.\\" It is challenging, slowly paced, dreary (I mentioned that), disturbing, at times intensely, almost shockingly sad, and does not feel the need to shoehorn in anything all that uplifting - though I wouldn't call it needlessly maudlin. It simply reflects how life can be, particularly in the face of loss and one's own mortality, and there is beauty there. It can take a long slog through a lot of pain, but it's there.<br /><br />I had to read this book for a class. I doubt I would have finished it otherwise. As someone who suffers from depression, generalized anxiety, and a terrible phobia of death to boot, this was one of the hardest books I've ever had to read. Every single step was difficult and on some days my mood and demeanor were noticeably affected. And yet I also feel it was one of the most effective, well-crafted, subtle, satisfying, and unexpectedly gorgeous books I've ever read. I feel changed for the better, having read it, as if by having this difficult experience I may better understand the relationships I will have throughout my life and will appreciate them all the more for as long as they last. For a novel I early on in the reading dismissed in class discussion as \\"The more long-winded, spitefully pessimistic counter-argument to Alfred Lord Tennyson's 'Crossing the Bar,'\\" I think that's just about as much of a turnaround as I could have experienced.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book it keeps you on your toes with the suspense and what woman doesn't like the sex scenes. I would definitely recommend that you read the whole series.
B0018RFLQ2|4.0|Nice Family movie about the world of childhood chess competitions but the overall theme of not 'squandering yourself' has some real implications for the adult characters and indeed anyone in the wider world of the mathematical sciences.
B004U8VWLE|4.0|i never give details of my opinions about works of art. my headline says it all. this a journey inward
B007THA4FI|4.0|I really liked Casual Vacancy, except there was a bit too much background information at the beginning. it took me half way thru the book to really get into it.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|doesn't work on original kindle fire.<br />please fix it and do you really need 1.25gb for all that HD artwork when really some text and basic illustrations would suffice... I know the artwork is cool but is it really that necessary to the point where the game is unplayable.
B005KELW26|5.0|I like that there is a magnetic tab so the cover stays closed when I'm not using my Kindle - feels like it is protected.
B00CE3IC74|5.0|So far so good, they work great on my I9500 Samsung Galaxy S 4 international version, you get what you pay for plus great quality products.<br /><br />I'm buying another lot of them!
B0058YPGSY|5.0|Glad I'm able to find all the seasons at Amazon.  Once I started watching, I had to have them all.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|The book was way better. But not too bad for an adaptation. I think Peeta needed to be a bigger guy. It drives me nuts. Also, there is zero chemistry between characters.
B00AW57L96|5.0|Overall an enjoyable read. Three entangled stories, all encased with secrets. It's a bit of a thriller and a page turner.
B005LAIIHG|5.0|it depends what you like,  to me this movie was very good  kind of slow, but I enjoyed it lots
B0092S4WLY|5.0|Kept me occupied, I am not the brightest at playing these games but I was able to get through the floors, cant wait on more to come.
0802473156|5.0|this book here is great me and my wife read together and it helped on things we didnt know about bour relationship
1419705644|5.0|We were not sure about this book, but my son has not put the book down since we gave it to him as part of this B-day gifts, he has read it at least a couple of times and he continues to find new little nuggets of info every time, great addition to his expanding library.
B007B6VOG0|4.0|Fun :)  I heard the some Some Nights while riding with my sister to my niece's graduation.. It was a pleasure to hear a young group who created a score with unusual melody with unexpected high and lows.. The harmonies were excellent.  Each song tells a story.  Highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Loved the books so far (books one and two) going onto Fifty shades of freed...they are intoxicating and it makes you not want to put them down...love the mystery that Christian offers along with Ana's innocence....
1451673442|4.0|Like the Secret and the author, So I wanted something extra and the information is giving me more understanding. I like it.
B0016Q2D5M|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies .... It is good quality and my purchase experience was fast and easy thanks
1439130833|5.0|I had this book for seven years and it was falling a part from reading it every day of the year. Great help to me.
630460291X|5.0|I bought this movie sometime back and I love watching .. The only problem is it has to be taken out and flipped over to finished watching.  Other than that it is good quality and watch often...thanks
B00E0MCYPS|3.0|It's a high quality fun game that requires more skill than I've been able to muster so far, but I've only raced 3 or 4 times.  The imagery is very good, so are the selection of cars as well as your ability to choose different driving views i.e. viewing your car from behind, looking out the windshield, etc.  You begin racing one or more opponents (selectable) and need to win the heat before being allowed to move on to different tracks.  You have options to steer and control your car by tilting your device or by using on-screen buttons however both methods result in very rapid changes in direction and quite a bit of over steer.  It's definitely a fun game to play even if you do as badly as I have so far, actually the replay function, which is outstanding the way it manipulates various views, is better to watch after you've put in a bad performance.  I'm going to keep practicing though because it is fun to play.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Well written, unforgettable characters. I highly recommend this book.  When I got to the middle of the book, I couldn't put the book down.
B00CZAYL76|5.0|This album is fantastic! I can't wait for volume 2 to come out so I can order that one as well.
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Better than expected!  I would recommend to watch this whether you are a Tom Cruise fan or not.  Morgan Freeman is a cool cat as usual.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I had passed over reading this a few times as I generally don't like books about war.  However this book really isn't focused on the war itself, but of a boy and his siblings  growing up and surviving in the world where war has been a major focus for a long time.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by how much I liked the book.<br /><br />I would recommend this book for reading.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Keep clicking you will find what you need. Nice and free time waster. Enjoy it for the price :) It can't be beat.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I have not read much sci-fi, but I enjoyed this book.  Very much. Although it is a story-driven book,the character-building is good. The characters are real people even though they are not all human.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|Simply the best and easiest way to see and store your photos if you have a Picasa account.  It works seamlessly!  One of my favorite apps
B004X80QNG|5.0|This app is really nice! Nice and colorful tabs. Love that this app syncs with my Google calendar. Has alarms. Can set dates by week, days, months. This will be my main calendar app. I can set agenda's, folder's, private things, make lists. I was really shocked at all the things that I could do to customize it to the way I needed it. I was lucky enough to catch this as the app deal of the day. In love with this app. I can be very picky at times with things. When I first started the app I said to myself \\"NO WAYYYY!\\" My mouth dropped open at how I lucked up with this app. Oh and just so you know, this could also be great at helping you set goals for yourself!
B00AZ3027I|5.0|This movie is so great. It's a classic. My boys have been dancing around and singing the songs the Indians sang.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was a lovely, easy read. It presented real life issues in a remarkable and humorous, yet not inappropriate way. I loved every second of it and would recommend it in a heartbeat.
B005ZMUQCK|5.0|It's nice to have this movie without skips in it. We have watched this movie so many times on DVD that we have worn out several discs.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Very fun<br />The book was very entertaining but might not be suitable for kids under 13 although it is a very good read
1577314808|5.0|If you have been searching for years (or even decades) for the ultimate spiritual teaching and life guidebook, your search is over. This is the book. The one that teaches you exactly how life and our minds work, exactly how to attain \\"enlightenment\\" (right now, not after sitting on a mountaintop for years,) exactly how to feel fabulous all the time, and perhaps most important, exactly how we can contribute this moment-to-moment life-perfection to the world, ushering in the new world consciousness that will transform this hungry, sick, fighting, insane world into the joyful co-habitation it can be.<br /><br />If I could, I would buy a copy of this book - or better still, the audio version where the teachings come through even clearer - for every living soul on Earth, and coax them to listen to it all the way through, not once, but at least twice or three times. There is no way, if you listen intently and with an open mind/heart to these simple yet profound answers to everything about life, that you not come away transformed. Or at the very least, seriously informed about the way your mind & ego have been running you around in all the wrong directions, like a madman, and how you need to ask yourself some serious questions about how you're going to approach life differently Now.<br /><br />I have been a serious student of the Bible (Old & New Testament,) the Koran, the Tao, the Vedas, etc. and a committed meditator and spiritual practitioner for over 4 decades. I've spent extended time at the feet of some of the greatest, humblest teachers and sages of the last century. So I'm not coming from nowhere when I say with all my experience and heart, THIS is the teaching you've been looking for. This is the book. Get it. Read it. Again and again. Saturate your system with its wisdom and, no kidding, transform your life NOW.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Doing a Downton Abbey marathon - now I know what all the hoopla is about.  The whole series is fantastic and the 3rd season just keeps getting better and better.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I guess when you have two people with an insatiable sex drive, it's hard to describe each encounter in a new and fresh way through two entire books (so far).  But still entertaining, and the postlude to book two left me anxious to read book three!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|Bought the game just for journey and it was great! Wanted to try out the game of the year of 2012 and it was totally worth it. Definitely up there with one of the best PS3 titles on the system.
1439152799|3.0|Although this book is a fairly good read it's not as well crafted as some of Morton's other books such as The Secret Keeper. It might be that it is a little too gothic for my taste. Even so, parts of the plot did not seem to hold together well and were all together too fantastic. The characters were not as well drawn and they sometimes failed to engage me. I never quite felt as though I was \\"inside\\" the characters or could understand their thoughts and feelings. However the plot was very interesting; certainly intricate and twisted.  Having been blown away by The Secret Keeper I was a bit let down by this book.  However I still think it's worth a read if you like gothic novels.
0307949508|5.0|One of the greatest page-turners I've ever read! Can't wait for the movie, especially if it's Daniel Craig and Rooney Mara.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I actually liked this movie but they really tired to make it like Oceans 11. This would be fine but there was so much CG that it made it not believable. the beauty of Oceans 11 is that they make you think someone could actually do the things they are doing. This movie really didnt have many things that made you think &#34;they could really do that&#34;
B0093LINVK|1.0|Although this unit works just fine, I am giving it a \\"1\\" due to Intel's bizarre decision to not include a power cord, and then to use the money to include a music device that plays the Intel jingle when you open the cardboard carton. The AC adapter is included, just without a power cord. What a triumph of style over substance! The power cord is not the standard IEC one which one would expect to find lying around any computer facility, but has a smaller three-prong connector.<br /><br />The box says that you must purchase a power cord separately, but it doesn't say on the box which type of power cord is required! I managed to find _one_ in an electronics junk pile, but in general this is not an item that you would find at an electronic store like Fry's, and certainly not at Radio Shack. You can order it on Amazon. Had I not found that one cord, this unit would have lain idle until I could order the right one and get it shipped.<br /><br />I purchased this unit at Fry's.
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I watched this because there was so much talk about it. I haven't read the book, and I typically prefer classic movies. So, this was okay, for what it was. I'm just not a huge fan.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|You can't go worng with Intel. This has more than enough power then most people will need. It realy is a great buy.
B001FD5KJM|5.0|My son had been pestering me to watch this. I had started to watch it at his house, but was unable to watch more than a few minutes. I finally watched it on Amazon Prime, and I really enjoyed it. I have been a long-time fan of Robert Downey Jr., and I thought he was great in this film.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|I get Sigma force books when I have time for myself because I never want to put them down. Eye of God took me nearly 2weeks to read. It just did not hold my attention or enthusiasm as others have.
B001LM1456|4.0|I watched this to catch up on all the characters appearing in &#34;The Avengers&#34;. I had not seen the previous film starring Eric Bana(?). I found this film to be entertaining.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Grreat graphics hard to play on though screen in the begining but with time was able to make better game play.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|I cannot imagine a cat doing all the things Bob did.  No cat I have ever had would think of walking on a leash or stit still when there are a lot of people around.
B003B02OOG|3.0|Good to be able to pick up and put down with the Kindle app. Endearing short stories are very small town.
0062255657|5.0|Neil Gaiman has an amazing talent of finding the unusual and fantastical in the most ordinary of places.  Like &#34;Coraline&#34;, &#34;The Ocean at the End of Lane&#34; appears to be a story of children with strong imaginations.  However, Gaiman helps you remember the childhood imagination you once had or still do.  He lures you into a wonderful story of the hurts and wonders of childhood with an extra touch of magic.  This story involves a young, reclusive boy who has been dealt some tough cards by life.  He befriends an unusual girl who helps him through these challenges via very unconventional approaches.  This story will make you happy, sad, mad, tense, elated, and wonderful.  This would be an excellent film.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is the first Gaming mouse I've used, and I'm quite satisfied.<br /><br />Pro's : Software is easy to install and configure.<br />Adjustable colors on the light.<br />Very ergonomic, easy to press buttons.<br />Sturdy Chord.<br /><br />Con's : You have to download the software from their website. It's not included in the packaging.<br />Weight's don't feel like they add much substance.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoy the mouse though.<br /><br />A+
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|Lady Gaga has a talent for making you move with her music.  I like the music get low during the first part of the chorus and then hits you with a bolt of musically energy.  I reminds me of when the lights go down before the artist appears on stage and BOOM---the lights and music hit you in the face and you scream for more.  I can't wait to hear the rest of the album!
B0018RFLN0|5.0|Very nice movie. Keeps enthralled. The train fighting sequence is outstanding. Tom Cruise has done well and is worth the time and money spent..
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Dredd was better than the Sylvestor Stallone flop that preceded this one. But to much emphasis on killing and no character development. Karl Urban is a talented actor, but ultimately a bad plot and over thought emphasis on just grotesque killing scenes made this a great B movie to watch and forget.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Incredible futuristic fiction with a coming of age tale. The way Orson draws you into the complex mind of the main character is incredible.
B009ZQFSRA|3.0|Movie was to slow, had some great action scenes and some good acting. But the story was so predictable to its conclusion which made it boring at to many times while trying to build the character.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I'm certainly not into zombies or horror flicks, but watching THE WALKING DEAD was a new experience for me.  Never knew what was going to happen next, very exciting and the acting is really good.  Can hardly wait for the new season to start!
B00A85EMVK|2.0|This review is solely based on the 3d quality which simply put is terrible. Being a 3d nerd and perhaps one of few in my generation not to have seen the movie, I thought I was in for a double pleasure. I was wrong on both accounts. If you want to see the movie and cant wait to see it on tv for free...well buy a dvd version and save some $$$$$$ and most likely it will be of better quality !
B00BC24NT4|5.0|great characters and descriptions; leaves enough to the imagination but not too much.  Have always liked Le Carre a lot.
B0091QS88K|1.0|This a cute game but the game only lets you prepare 4 dishes unless you buy the full game. So do not listen to the other guys listen to Me! It also gets dull after 5 minutes. Do NOT  what ever you do Do NOT GET THIS APP GET THE FULL ONE!!!
B004IPPINW|5.0|Have never read a book written in the second person singular voice before -- a very interesting idea and I think it worked well here.  I did NOT like the movie -- it filled in too much detail, explained too many things did not leave enough to my imagination,
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This game is the best since temple run 2. It has the best graphics, and great adventure in the game. In my opinion You HAVE TO BUY THIS APP! Trust me it is worth it.

B000069KE0|5.0|I have been a big fan of Chicago for a long time. In fact, it is my quest to own everything that they have ever put out. As an avid music collector, the Chicago set is a must-have and a constant pursuit.
1594204217|5.0|Micheal Pollan tell his personal journey of learning about food. The book is divided by elements, fire (cooking food) water (boilibg food) earth (fermenting food) and air (steaming food) as a nutrition major I love micheal pollan and have read many of his books. This one in particular is great because it looks at food preperation in ways I personally had never considered before.

0345803485|1.0|I got on the bandwagon and read this book when it first came out.  Wow, I'm just wondering how many bribes were paid to put up good reviews of this trash.  I felt like the author had a good sense of plot and the overall arch, but the prose was seriously lacking.  I'm fine with erotica, as long as it's good.  But when it's bad erotica, it's like watching a obese stripper... You deeply cringe and wonder why you'd even subject yourself to something like this.<br /><br />Sadly enough, I actually finished all of the books.  I really wish I could get my time back.

B007IQWQ88|4.0|Even though I've never been a particular \\"fan\\" of Karajan, I couldn't pass up this box - all of HvK's non-operatic DG recordings from the 1960s with the original LP jackets and labels, a generous booklet, and facsimiles of several recording session logs.<br /><br />No surprise: The high point here is the proto-typical German repertoire. One can plainly hear why the 1961-1962 Beethoven Symphony cycle is legendary: I've never heard a more searing funeral march from the Eroica - and it's nice to hear a chorus that can properly pronounce the German lyrics in the Ode to Joy. The Brahms Symphonies exude a dark luminosity, a contradiction that was central to Brahms' composing. I must confess I've never been a great fan of Brahms' First Symphony, where I feel the composer overreaches in his attempt to become the next Beethoven - but Karajan makes it all work, and the Fourth Symphony is in one continuous line - as it should be. The Wagner excerpts are appropriately epic, with no sense of these being bleeding chunks lifted from great operas - but fine works on their own merit.<br /><br />It's been noted by esteemed music historian Harvey Sachs that Karajan's \\"performances had a prefabricated, artificial quality\\" resulting from \\"an all-purpose, highly refined, lacquered, calculatedly voluptuous sound that could be applied, with the stylistic modifications he deemed appropriate, to Bach and Puccini, Mozart and Mahler, Beethoven and Wagner, Schumann and Stravinsky\\". For the most part, the Karajan \\"style\\" worked for much of the core 19th Century romantic repertoire, from Beethoven (yes, Virginia, Beethoven was a Romantic composer) through Richard Strauss. But when HvK strays from the 19th Century, prefabrication becomes a limitation. Much of the Mozart is in the thick, syrupy style that was losing favor even by the 1960s, and the Haydn is utterly lacking in the wit and verve associated with this composer. Worst of all is Bach which becomes the ultimate wallpaper music under HVK's baton - recordings to own for the purpose of showing how cultured one is, rather than for listening. At the other end of the temporal spectrum, HvK is clueless in anything post-Richard Strauss. Stravinsky once lambasted HvK's recording of The Rite of Spring, describing one part as \\"tempo di hoochie-koochie\\", and concluding that HvK's way with this seminal work makes it sound like \\"a pet savage rather than a real one\\" leaving it as inconsequential as Stravinsky's later works. And Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra amounts to a group of pretty sounds and harmonic piquancies without adding up to anything meaningful. The grit is missing.<br /><br />Then there are the concerto recordings. For the most part, the concertos are serviceable, if conductor driven, affairs (and HvK is hardly the only conductor who high-handed soloists). The Tchaikovsky Concerto with Richter (who reportedly despised the recording) was the most anti-charismatic recording of this warhorse ever made - until HvK repeated the trick with Kissin. But that's the low point. The high point here is the Beethoven First Concerto with Eschenbach, where the soloist freely embellishes as would have been heard in the composer's time. For violin concertos, HvK was content to stick with Christian Ferras - a pairing that produced some of the most anonymous concerto recordings in history.<br /><br />Sound quality/remastering: the documentation does not make clear which recordings have been newly remastered and which are using existing transfers. But all are acceptable, and demonstrate the sound DG typically gave Karajan in the 1960s: well-judged microphone placement (without obvious spot-miking), with plenty of hall ambience, adding up to a clear if slightly gauzed sonic picture.<br /><br />The book provides recording dates and locales. There are three essays, one sycophantic, the others perceptive.baton - recordings to own for the purpose of showing how cultured one is, rather than for listening.

B000002OVJ|5.0|This is one of The Who's better albums. Well orchestrated and taped well for a rocking good time. If you like live tracks, get this one.
B00EQRY5IQ|4.0|This is a great album if you like his early music. Some of the sound quality isn't the best but I can over look that
B000001EGA|5.0|Elton John music has a lot of memories attached to it. I wanted to pick this up so that I would not forget the fond memories of my past.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Love the Chromecast which arrived today. But I'm feeling a bit mislead/ripped off.<br /><br />WHen I placed my order there was a \\"3 free months\\" of Netflix offer attached to the deal. It was one of the main reasons I bit on the deal. Already having a netflix account saving $24.00 bucks made the Chromecast a very good deal.<br /><br />Well -- after looking for a redemption coupon and checking my order history I learned the free Netflix deal was rescinded AFTER my purchase. No email updating me to that fact (I ordered a few months ago on the day it was released/announced).<br /><br />I'm happy with the device but feeling a bit burned -- like a bait and switch. ;) Oh well, live and learn.
B0000630BT|5.0|I have been a Judas Priest fan since the '70s. They are one of the best NWOBHM bands in the world. Truly, a pioneer in the heavy metal genre.
B006LSZECO|3.0|But I just HATED the ending! The author really did a good job, and it was her prerogative on how she wanted it to end.it just did NOT work for me. Sorry.
B001R3YRG2|5.0|I love watching movies and it is nice to know that I can purchase just about any movie ever made. My collection is growing nicely.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Trust me...if you liked Grey, you will LOVE Gideon Cross!! Can't wait til the next one comes out! Hurry Sylvia!
B00008BRDX|5.0|This was music of my generation and I love it. Good vocals and good musicianship makes for a good combination. This is a must if you enjoyed the late 70s and early 80s music.
0399255370|5.0|As a parent I love a book that is a little out of the crayon box. This book is cute and witty, and though I would not say the crayons actually quit the reader gets a fun look at the perceptions of all the different crayons--would be an easy way to compare how all the kids in a class are all different and have a different way of looking at the world just like the crayons. As we hear how yellow and orange dispute over what color the sun is we are entertained. The final page on the book leaves you with a picture that is the child/owner of the crayons box's solution--he has drawn a picture to please all the crayons. This is a great way to engage a young child in comprehension questions in a fun way. What did he do for black crayon (he made a black rainbow) Why is there so little red on the Santa?<br /><br />I had such fun with this book that I gave it to another Mom as a must read! --and thinking this would be an awesome gift for a school birthday present, this book, a pad of paper and a box of crayons!
B00008BXJJ|5.0|This was music of my generation and I love it. Good vocals and good musicianship makes for a good combination. This is a must if you enjoyed the late 70s and early 80s music.
B006AZZPCM|4.0|Nice apk to download or watch  youtube videos. Recommend for down loading or to watch .I t is very fast
B000002MIB|5.0|This was music of my generation and I love it. Good vocals and good musicianship makes for a good combination. This is a must if you enjoyed the late 70s and early 80s music.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|The story line is not anything more than a crime drama, but what makes it interesting for me is how normal the actors look as they  portray their characters. That sense of everyone just looks too dolled up to be real isn't there. You get to see scruffy, tired, worn people. Danny's family don't look like movie stars; they look like a realistic family. For me, that is what makes the show unique, but relatable at the same time.
B00013F38K|5.0|The Kung Fu shows were some of the best in the 1970s and they have not lost their flare. It's still fun to watch them.
B004SGWYVA|5.0|This was a great series and I am looking forward to a sequel.  Yes, there is some fan service, but it's a very good storyline.
B0009IW98O|5.0|Bob Seger is an awesome singer and this album was one of his best old school songlist. If you like old school rock, this is a must buy for your collection.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Love this book! Thank you Nikki for sharing your story of a place many of us have never been and letting us see first hand that addiction is not something you choose.
B000002GBD|5.0|This was music of my generation and I love it. Good vocals and good musicianship makes for a good combination. This is a must if you enjoyed the late 70s and early 80s music.
B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|A completely different take on dieting. It is worth reading for a  new way of looking at dieting.relatively easy to understand his concepts.
B002A4Q652|5.0|This is a top notch group with top notch session recording.  Glad I got it for my daughter and I to enjoy.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun app!  Just make sure to turn off in app purchases if you let your kids play and make sure you have passwords set up for purchases.  I will probably spend a little money to get the fireman outfit for my kids.
B0042L78MG|3.0|It's not what I expected, but not a bad little CD...I don't listen as often as I'd like to, so perhaps I'll share it with someone else.  :-)
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|I am so excited to start season two. I recommend it to everyone especially since Jax will be playing Christian Grey. You have to watch SOA to know how awesome he will be as Christian Grey.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|This book was a very easy to read.  I especially liked all the various, unique characters.  The family relationships of the main character were a bit strange, though, and I felt left hanging with a lack of closure on the father-son relationship.  I would recommend this book to others.  It was a very unique book, and one that would be enjoyed by young adults as well as adults.  Clever and creative.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|Won't load on my Kindle Fire.  Claims I don't have enough memory. So I have no idea how the game plays
B000002LIM|5.0|This soundtrack definitely helps people appreciate The Dark Knight Trilogy all the more. Every track on this album, from the main theme to the reminiscence of the death of Bruce's parents stirs at the core of everyone who can relate to this character and even those who can't. Enjoy.
B000PC0S5K|5.0|This book really just helped me to see life in a different way that cuts past all the anxiousness and stress society lays on you. Eckhart Tolle has a way with words that brings you into the state of peaceful being that he talks about. I would recommend it to anyone.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|The book was very entertaining.  I was sorry that it ended.  I would recommend the book.  I kept imagining what I would do if I woke up married.  Very good book.
B00406O7YK|5.0|Great role for Ms Streisand.  Each time I watch this movie is as enjoyable as the first.  Good music and dancing.  grab the popcorn and enjoy the night.
B002VWNID6|1.0|I really like this movie. Really I like the movie, no complaints here.<br /><br />This DVD is laughable. It is really a 4:3 letterboxed copy of the movie, not widescreen, but letterboxed..... ON ALL 4 SIDES!!!<br /><br />The video is grainy, reminds me of drive-in movies during a cicada migration.<br /><br />Half the movie is on one side of the disc, then you eject it, turn it over, and watch the other half of the movie. As poorly as the video quality is, surely they could have put it all on one side of the DVD...<br /><br />For $4, I guess I got what I paid for.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|If you are like me and am a fan of almost all things British, especially historical dramas, you will love this series.  Great characters and as always, great acting.  A well cast series.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|Loved the story, and the color was so beautiful in HD I  Recommend this movie to everyone. Good movie for the everyone
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|good scifi feeling. awesome scenery. decent acting, some holes in the story, but hey, its a package deal. must see.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Even though this movie was a dark, it was so great to watch a flick that wasn't gory or bloody - yet, it delivered suspense and thrill without it.  Jack the Giant Slayer is not a film for tiny tots and not the story I grew up with, but I thought it's appropriate for older children and adults.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Purchased solely for being able to watch YouTube without an HDMI cable and way better than the free YouTube remote app. The set up is a bit different but works well and I like the option of being able to move to other windows, checking email, etc while watching videos. There's a small learning curve which doesn't take long to get through. Well worth the purchase.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I just want to read all of the books now, this was so captivating and I just need to know what the little guy does next
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Loved the special effects, though the basis for the story could have been better explained.  I was disappointed though in Morgan Freeman - one of my favorite actors of all time and he was barely in the movie.  He played an interesting character who could have used more development.  This is a Tom Cruise movie period.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I loved it, I'm starting to think I love Gideon Cross more than Christian Grey!!! This book is similar but still so captivating. I never thought I could read books so fast
B00008CMR6|4.0|THIS IS A MAN'S MOVIE WITH A LOT OF VIOLENCE, BUT JUSTICE DOES PREVAIL.  NO CURRENT ACTORS MATCH THE &#34;DUKE&#34;.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|A book I can reread and learn something new.  I will recommend it to others and have already recommended it.
B009NY43NY|3.0|I didn't love this one as much as the rest of the books in the series.  It wasn't awful, but I didn't find myself immersed in it like I did with the others.
B000HF6XPY|3.0|What can I say? While this was produced by Dino DeLaurentis (the same person who produced the two Conan movies with &#34;Ah-nold&#34;), and thus has a better production value than most swords-and-sorcery movies, that's not really saying that much. If you like this sort of movie (and I do), it's not a bad addition to your collection, but if you're looking for epic fantasy, you'd be better off with Lord of the Rings. Brigette does a good job as the infamous &#34;she-devil with a sword&#34; (and I believe this is her first starring role), and a young Ernie Reyes Jr. is amusing as the spoiled brat Prince Talen. Not bad for $5 or $10, but I wouldn't pay more for it.
B008JEJPSC|5.0|Best movie for little kids!  For got all the adult content, Mrs. Hannigan the booze, the men...guessing my kids will miss that too!  Classic!
B000P0J024|5.0|What do you get when you combine George Harrison of the Beatles, Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, Tom Petty (minus the Heartbreakers), Roy Orbison, and Bob Dylan? One AMAZING group, that's what! The Wilburys put out such amazing music together, it's practically criminal that they only released two albums. Slightly off-kilter lyrics mix with amazing vocal talent and great guitar work for a band that's so good, it's practically indescribable. If you like any of the five separately, I'd recommend this collection; all of them together will blow your mind!<br /><br />The DVD has a short featurette of how George rounded up the rest of the band and how they decided to release an album together, and it's really amusing and fun to watch. It also includes videos of some of their hits, making it a nice companion to the two CDs. In short, the set is a definite good deal.
B00EQNYOYU|5.0|Reznor reinforces that he is a talented mixer and composer.  NIN is edgy for some tastes, but I feel I can draw my wife in for a listen without her scrunching up her nose at it.  Hesitation Marks follows his past work/style with a few nice additional accents. The framework evokes previous works &#34;Fragile&#34; and &#34;Ghosts&#34;.  It is my favorite NIN album to date.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Awesome game great to play when you have free time.  Great for young children to play lots of fun get it today
B00BXI26XC|4.0|What a great toy.  I sit on my deck looking at airplanes going overhead and now I don't have to wonder what they are and where they're going.  This information is now a click away.
B009KY5OGC|5.0|What can one say.  I was brought up in a time of cowboy vs. Indian movies so my beliefs were rooted.  What truth can do to ones mind is fascinating.  We as Americans can't be proud of these times but still can't let them rule our future other than make us more aware of human rights.  Sad but history is full of sad times.  If only we could really learn.  Great reading.
B00ATSBIIG|2.0|I had this on my &quot;saved for later&quot; list for a long time and finally spent the money. So disappointed!  I kept waiting for it to get harder and it never did. I like puzzles but there is nothing challenging about this game--a child can do it! Which is fine, just not what I'm looking for. Lesson learned  caveat emptor!
B009ZZDNT6|3.0|Had to uninstall the paid version and go back to free after it twice drained my kindle fire battery from about 80% to 0. The free version is somewhat more limiting (no music alarms) and has large ads, but better than a dead device.
B00AKFG15S|4.0|This is the last of the Clifton Cronicles. An interesting story. Jeffrey Archer is definitely on of my favorite authors.
B00D6BU8GG|3.0|First one was great, second and third was funny and great. It should stop there. This one is over the top.
B00ECU34ZM|3.0|this movie has good FX .<br />I really liked the flying machine.<br />the plot is o.K .<br />Good afternoon entertainment
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Great eye-brain workout. Love it! I take my Kindle Fire to Doctor appointments. Passes off the time fast while waiting.
B006YTTVHO|4.0|Very straightforward and insightful while explaining much \\"heard of\\" advice. As a \\"shy optimist\\" it's great to be able to go into a situation with a few techniques in hand when meeting new people. A great read anyone looking to meet new people in their hometown or new city.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|As an avid Sci Fi fan, Oblivion does not disappoint both aesthetically and cognitively. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|A special effects masterpiece.  Keeps you guessing throughout.  A great cast and I would highly recommend seeing this movie.  Sit back and enjoy
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Suspend your disbelief for a moment and give in wholly to this retelling of a childhood favorite. Jack the Giant Slayer does not disappoint. All the human parts are well cast, though the giants could've used more substance. Regardless 4/5 would recommend.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|I love this app<br />It's great for kids and parents I play it on my Kindle and my cousins play it to
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|I wish I would've read the books before heading down the Hobbit hole (and the LOTR trilogy). While, as with the Fellowship of the Ring, it may start out slow, The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey does not disappoint! Also, as with the first in the LOTR series, it whets your appetite just enough, and leaves you wanting more...
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This is an engrossing tale of human nature and manipulation in an all too possible setting. I'd recommend this saga to anyone.
B009O2XY12|5.0|This is one of the best games ever!!! But I am stuck on level 65. Seriously, get this app. I love it!!!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|The stories are dark, interesting and complex and open to many different ways to keep it  going. There is a story along with many side stories that gets you wonderingand trying to connect the dots every minute. Its is spell-The characters have a real depth rarely seen on screen which is backed up by a lot of very solid acting. Indeed, the conflicting elements to the central characters which makes the show so great would unlikely be pulled off without actors of the calibre of Claire Danes, Damian Lewis, Mandy Patinkin and Morena Baccarin (also particular kudos to the daughter played by Morgan Saylor - one to watch out for in the future). Not only do you watch these characters go through some truly weird and strained circumstances, you really feel it too.This is a very real, well thought out and well executed show. Two big thumbs up to everyone involved. For everybody else - go watch it.
0553108034|5.0|I am a major fan of the TV series and have watch each episode 5-8 times to make sure I understood everything that was said.  I bought the first 5 books and I'm almost done with book 2, but will hold off reading book 3 until Season 4 is over.  Unlike Book 1 and Season 1 of Game of Thrones, in which the series closely follows the book, Season 2 only uses certain aspects of the Book 2.  In Season 2, the story is compressed and many of the minor characters are eliminated, thus leaving out quite a bit of the store.  I don't mind it because if you are a fan of the TV series, reading the book is like watching the same show with lengthy alternative scenes.  The basic storyline is still there in the TV series, however in the book, the major and minor characters' roles are more fleshed out.  What I like about the book is that it allows the reader to better understand the inner thoughts and motives of the main characters as they speak.  Many of the TV characters' statements are taken verbatim from the book, which I like.  I can't wait for George R R Martin to finish writing the next books so I could add them to my collection.  Go House of Stark and House of Tully.  I love my direwolves.  Where can I get one or two?
B0000VCZKW|5.0|This is a great movie to sit down and watch with the whole family. You don't have to worry about content with younger children.
B005F3GMAO|4.0|I enjoyed every word and phrase. It inspired me to pursue as an entrepreneur and fueled my business ideas, specially in the environmental field. I am glad the world has businessmen as Richard Branson.
B000065V42|5.0|Excellent family movie provided lots of laughs on our weekly family movie nights. Can't wait to watch the next two movies in the series. Classic
1423140591|5.0|I think this is one of my favorite books ever, it's absolutely lovely. We get Percy back and Percy's POV, but we also get other people's POV so we can see how much of a BAMF Percy is. I loved that since when you get Percy's POV you just see him as he see's himself, which is pretty far from how other people see him apparently. Of course that's not all this book is about. We get a major quest with life or death consequences and prophecies that don't seem to bode well. I also really liked the look we got at Camp Jupiter. The only thing I didn't like about this book is that it had to end!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The scene that will always stay with me is the Hulk and Loki. I laugh out loud just thinking about it. After that there are too many great scenes to write them all. so I will just say great movie will watch again and again
B00932A4XE|4.0|it was a very cute movie... but seemed like it would be enjoyed more by a younger, child bearing age group.  Our grandson's wife said they watched it during the first few months of her first baby and they LOVED LOVED LOVED it!  it does show the trials some have getting pregnant and the 'ease' for others...  all done in a comedy setting.
0425252868|5.0|This story needed to be told. I felt as if I was there living their experiences. The ending brought tears to my eyes. Thank you Adam, I look forward to reading more of your work.
B00B9366VO|5.0|A unique behind the scenes look at how music was and should be made...  All from a gritty little hole in the wall studio, that turned out some truly iconic music.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Awesome keyboard!  You will not be disappointed if you download.  With the cloud backup it is even better!  Go ahead and try it!
140123755X|5.0|Loaned my copy of volume one of Fables long ago and never got it back.  This is a creative series that just keeps getting more interesting.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Totally addictive viewing. Character development , story line, the period settings and costumes are fabulous AND Maggie Smith ices the cake.
B000UD08HW|5.0|Great quality and well Gilmour is a god! It just doesn't get any better that this. Video and audio done very well.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|Wanted to link to Twitter on my Kindle - so I downloaded the app. Now I can link to Twitter on my Kindle.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|I was very impressed with this product. I can't believe how great it works. I would truly recommend it to my family and friends.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|I truly love the first three books of this series, although I'm normally not a fantasy fan. This book is just not up to the standards of the other four. Mr Martin is an accomplished and imaginative storyteller, but you wouldn't know it from this book. The numerous plot lines plod slowly but mostly uninterestingly along, seemingly not really going anywhere - or at least nowhere I cared to follow. And the endless number of very minor, minor, semi-important, possibly important, temporarily important, important, and very important characters are always difficult to keep straight without Mr. Martin's use of coy chapter titles. &#34; The Discarded Knight,&#34; &#34; The Bra-less Khaleesi,&#34; &#34; The Hirsute Lovelorn Humbert Humbert Knight&#34; ( ok, those may not be accurate) serve no purpose other than to further confuse a series already in need of its own card catalogue. The main characters veer so wildly from their previous personalities as to be almost recognizable. Tyrion, easily the most practical and thoughtful of characters, wanders sullenly about unfamiliar lands taking little or no part in his own story and contributing so little to the story that he could have been left out entirely. The normally fiery little Lolita/Madonna of Dragons has gone from a world-conqueror with her eyes fixed firmly on her stolen throne to an indecisive teenager sighing over a sellsword's gold partial and too stupid to think of putting a cushion on a bench when her butt hurts. A whole lot of nothing is going on here, and I mean a LOT - this book is massive. The worst part of all is that the general feeling I took from the book is that Martin was bored with the story and the characters and just churning out a filler to appease his editors and fans. Read the other four books, especially the first three. For this tome, I'd recommend the Cliff Notes.
B00ET7EON4|5.0|I'm not going to spend time comparing this to their earlier works; they're two sides of the same coin. I'm just going to keep it short - It's a different sound. Darker, grittier, and more rock and roll. It's a surprising album, that's definitely going to be on repeat.
B001BKVWYG|5.0|As with the other CD I purchased, this one is great listening. Cannot believe he was passed over in the 70's.
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|Question: Which version is most campatable with Kindle Fire HD? Please identify the proper software (Flash Player) to install that is compatible with the Kindle Fire HD.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I have really enjoyed listening to Rodriquez. Great collection. Find the music great to listen to and enjoy as I travel.
B000UR9T82|5.0|This is such an incredible trilogy to have on Blue-ray! The price couldn't be beat and the movie quality is fantastic! Great buy!!
B00CATSONE|5.0|Having worked in a power plant as a young and only woman- I wondered about Tesla.  Thanks to this enlighting and easy read book I can understand the man so much better.  The drive it took to know you have a good product when people with more money said you did not. The courage to keep going forward after giving up your patents. Would have stopped most ordinary folks.  THANKS AND KEEP WRITING GOOD BOOKS LIKE TESLA<br />If anyone works around electricity you will enjoy this book
B00164KYV4|5.0|This is not your typical romantic comedy and that is why my husband and I love it! Could watch it over and over again without getting bored!
B0007MAJBQ|4.0|If you are an audiophile that still uses mini-discs, this is worht its weight in gold. Cant be beat for the price.
B002ZG9968|5.0|This is such a cute &#34;Chick flick&#34; that even my husband enjoyed watching! The price was great, movie was great, and perfect for the not so mushy movie lover at heart!
B004JMY312|5.0|I was able to share this movie with my two young daughters.  It has been one of my favorites since I was a kid and now it's also a favorite of my children's!  The quality and ease of accessibility were amazing!  I will definitely be renting from Amazon again!!
B001GCUO4S|5.0|The perfect ending to a great series! Such a great movie and is a must have if you have the rest!
B009GX69RK|5.0|you can't go wrong with New Girl, though I would start with season 1, if you're just getting started so you can learn more about the characters.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Great show Only made better by watching it on my schedule. I watched the whole 2nd season in one long weekend.
0393964582|5.0|Speedy delivery, excellent quality...easy and smooth transaction. The book was needed as a summer reading project and got in in plenty of time to read before school started. Thank you!
B008133MDK|5.0|Such smart TV.  Great acting.  Fabulous writing.  And the subtleties of the actors is amazing.  A great modern update to such a well known character.
B0042AGN6Y|5.0|This is one of the best movies Harrison Ford has starred in (next to Indiana Jones).  The color and clarity on this blu-ray<br />is great.
B0032JTV74|5.0|I got the whole first season for $50 less than it would have been if I had purchased it from Best Buy.
B00AW8UK0K|2.0|Uncomplicated for sure but addresses no health issues. Falls short, as many diets do in that it attempts to be a &#34;one size fits all&#34; diet. I agree that people need to be guided and advised to eat better in ways as similar as possible to the way they want to eat, rather than the way science wants, but the modification advised by this diet can't be the excuse to &#34;carry on as usual&#34; or &#34;get away with it&#34;!<br />I do think Dr Mosley has succeeded in making great TV, but the printing of this book is nothing more than an attempt to make a Fast Buck. Lots of unnecessary page fillers and nothing I couldn't have completed in one email.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Fast-moving, suspenseful, keep your interest with surprising twists even up to the end. I would definitely recommend viewing this movie.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|My heart sours for Jaycee and her children to overcome such an uncalled for event in their lives.  Kudos to you, Ms. Jaycee!!  Stay strong my friend.
B000VDDWDS|4.0|Think you might have what it took to be a sailor 200 years ago?<br />View this gem of a movie and get a first-hand look at what life<br />was like for British sailors chasing a French warship on the<br />high seas.  Russell Crowe renders one of his best performances<br />as the commander of the British ship and crew.  Great movie!
B00881VLCE|4.0|Best puzzle game I've played. I like the variety (amount of pieces, categories, rotating pieces) and options. The pieces can be hard to pick up sometimes though.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|Had my attention from the strt .  Loved it.  Actors were perfectly cast and kids in the vie did a fantastic job
1577314808|5.0|I purchased this for my son.  It came recommended by his Dr.  It was a very helpful book for him to read.
B009GX6TMA|5.0|Good quality series on instant watch. It is the same price as the DVD but you can watch it immediately.
B007SGM084|5.0|It is absolutely fantastic. The way this history move around .<br />What I don't understand is the stores with names appeared in this book.
B00EV4EUT8|4.0|4 1/2 stars<br /><br />The Butler (aka Lee Daniel's The Butler) is an emotional, powerful film based on the story of a real life butler who worked at The White House; the film deals primarily with the civil rights movement as it influences the life of an African-American youth who grows up to be a butler employed at The White House. The relationship between the subservient African-American butler who must never speak his mind nor react to whatever is being said by very powerful white people highlights the deplorably low status in society that African-Americans endured especially during the time the butler, named Cecil Gaines in this film, was employed at The White House. In addition, the effects of both Vietnam and American politics in general are well explored as experienced by Cecil and his family. However, while that is all well done, and the performances in this film are tremendously good and poignant, the storyline itself is a bit choppy--for example, the earlier years of the butler's (Cecil's) working at The White House are explored in greater detail and length than the later years--President Ford's administration is dealt with for barely more than 15 seconds as we see a clip of him talking on the television as President and President Carter doesn't get too much time in this film, either. There's still more to the plot but I'll leave some out so you can watch and appreciate this film as much as I did.<br /><br />I also give the filmmakers and the others who worked on this film a tremendous amount of credit for making this all come alive--for example, the makeup was so convincing I could completely believe that people like Cecil are aging as the movie progresses! The sets are very well done and the choreography and cinematography both shine. The musical score, while not too extensive since this is certainly no musical, enhances the film as well making it all the more powerful and memorable.<br /><br />Again, however, it is the story of an African-American man and his quest for at least a half-way decent life (or at least survival) for himself and his family in a world in which the white man dominated the black man that truly captivated me. The plot is full of poignant moments that brought tears of sadness to my eyes: we see the butler (Cecil Gaines played with panache by Forest Whitaker) so broken and scarred by the horrific violence he witnessed in his youth that when his son Louis (David Oyelowo) wants to join the Freedom Riders he promptly and angrily dismisses the movement as futile; Cecil also forbids Louis to even just attend a civil rights rally held in the late 1950s when the family is already living in Washington, D.C. and supposedly (but of course not really) treated noticeably better than African-Americans were treated in the South. Oprah Winfrey's portrayal of Cecil's wife Gloria with her strengths and inner demons also stunned me with its raw power; Oprah's ability to make Gloria come to real life on that screen is remarkable. Adriane Lenox as Gina and Pernell Walker as Lorraine astounded me with their exceptionally convincing performances that I won't forget anytime soon.<br /><br />There are, as many others have noted, quite a few big name stars who lend their presence to the film and make it even more powerful. Look for Mariah Carey as Hattie Pearl, Cecil's mother; Vanessa Redgrave as Annabeth Westfall; Robin Williams as Dwight D. Eisenhower; John Cusack as Richard Nixon; James Marsden as John F. Kennedy; Liev Schreiber as Lyndon B. Johnson; Alan Rickman and Jane Fonda as Ronald and Nancy Reagan; Clarence Williams III as Maynard; Jim Gleason as R.D. Warner; Cuba Gooding Jr. as Carter Wilson; Lenny Kravitz as James Holloway and Minka Kelly as Jacqueline Kennedy.<br /><br />Overall, The Butler will remain one of the better films of 2013 and I highly recommend it for people interested in racial issues and the history of our country's long and rocky struggle to become a society in which everyone is truly equal. In addition, people who appreciate dramas, especially dramas based on real life stories, will not be disappointed..

B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Game is easy to navigate. Definitely a good stress reliever  for those busy work days where you just want to focus on something light.
B001ECPJZO|5.0|This is an amazing product! Iove it as much as my kods do.. my daughter learned to tie her shoes within a week of having it. :-)
B00ADIT8U2|4.0|It had a good story that was progressed by the players action. Graphics were good. Puzzles were fine. Wish it was longer. Glad I bought it and will play again. I love it when the games have a story and the player has to think how to accomplish a task.I will look up the makers of these type of puzzles again. They seem to want to make a quality product. I hope they come out with more story based games.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Defending Jacob was a wonderful book, whatever you do don't page back to the ending you will never imagine it
B00C9U9YOW|5.0|Such a solid album. Been listening to it everyday since I bought it. Songs like Kalopsia and I Sat by the Ocean will bring tears to your eyes. Recommend this album to anyone.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|too confusing too many changes not well explained.  not very user friendly for adults.  Kids understand it I sure as heck do't
B00EY7LT9Q|4.0|Not on par with Iron Man, but the story is engaging and the sequences are well filmed. 7 out of 10.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Excellent movie entertainment!!! Action packed and star powered  your family will enjoy the adventures of these lovable superheroes & their fight for the planet earth!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Lots of fun with this game where the conducter is chasing you down. My 6 year old grandson taught me how to play!
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|Since purchase I have lost track of how many times I have watched this movie and it's predecessor. The action is unrivaled and the nods to previous Star Trek incarnations really made me feel like this movie was made for the long time fan.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I love this game. My only issue is you cannot have it on two devices at once. I tried to have it on my phone and kindle and it didn't work at all. Kept satin cloud conflict.
037582913X|5.0|I had this book when I was a kid. I loved it then, and I still love it today. The illustrations are just how I remembered them. When I found that my son liked this book, I had no questions about buying it for him. It's nostalgic for me, and fun for him.
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Wanted this CD, so I bought it, fast and simple, no problems! Amazon is just an awesome place to buy so many different things, love it.
0307987698|3.0|I got this book because my son loves The Monster at the End of This Book. The story is basically the same, but they added Elmo into the mix. It's cute. But I have to mention that Golden Books has really gone downhill with their books. They are nothing like they were when I was a child. The binding is weak and the book just seems cheap and flimsy to me. It's poorly put together and it's upsetting to me because I have such great memories of these books. But, I suppose you get what you pay for....Golden Books are relatively cheap. I of course recommend the book....how can you not love Grover and Elmo? Your child will get a good laugh (if you make reading the book fun and do voices!).
0061900656|5.0|This book is adorably illustrated. I like that the baby in the book is not a brother or sister, so it can have a larger audience.  It shows how the big brother can help with the new baby, and stresses how important the big brother is to the family.  It explains how the baby is different from big brother, as he can do lots of things baby can't yet do.<br /><br />We just got this book in the mail and my son keeps asking to read it over and over.  He is almost 3 years old and really enjoys it.
B0099114WO|3.0|I find that it's an ok movie. I was expecting it to be a little more humorous than it is based on the movie trailers. It's more sad and slow than I thought it would be. I kind of wish I didn't buy it, because I most likely won't watch it again.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Intricate and engrossing. I enjoyed the HBO adaptation, but the characters and settings are handled with so much care and depth in these books
B002QYNIHU|4.0|The S.H. figuarts products are very detailed and lots of moving parts.<br />The detailing is very accurate and well done.<br />A couple of parts don't snap in as easily as others.<br />But overall a very nice product.<br />It was packaged very well, arrived before expected.<br />Very happy with seller.<br />Thank you!
B0090XLDKY|5.0|This movie took me back to my childhood. Great story, great acting, great dancing, great singing, great directing and no political statements from Hollywood. Entertainment in its purest form.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|I downloaded this app at PC Mag 's urging, like many people I'm sure. It works great for my general cleaning purposes, removing the little crap files that would slow down my processing otherwise. I will continue to use it daily.
0802473156|5.0|If you and your spouse only have one book (besides the bible) in your library, I would suggest this. It is so important to understand how to make your spouse feel loved. Studying this book together with your spouse will help you understand each others emotional needs as you walk towards Christ together.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|This is a book that shows what real life was like for black slaves.  The surprising part was when a white girl was raised with the slaves & they became her family.  Very sad but heartwarming in many ways.  I would highly recommend it.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|it really made me feel for her and her brother and what they suffered. I have recommended this to all my friends
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Very challenging and mind consuming! If you like detective games and item searches. If you like those types of games this one is for you!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Not sure if it was the cinematography or the choice in music but this movie just didn't do it for me.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|Very fun! I wish it would load faster and not lag quite so much, but still<br /> overall very cute. Awesome awesome
1476751935|5.0|The power of positive thinking & gratitude has changed my life in ways nothing else ever has or could.<br />To have this precious tool, a little boost to read everyday, is the best gift you could give yourself, a loved one, or a stranger you might meet, who could use a miracle...pass it on, pay it forward, and so on...
B009LRE040|2.0|Sorry I fell asleep due to the emotional drowning, constant reversal, never ending fights, explosions, and never ending action. It was like a Sylvester Stallone, Bruce Williams, Tom Cruise on steroids. Even in Rambo, Rocky and Mission Impossible there were periods of STORY you could enjoy. Sorry but despite the rave reviews by the cult followers, this movie was almost a dud.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This show is so out, I love it! It's important to watch it in order (from start to finish) b/cuz of JJ Abrams' brilliance in story telling.<br />I love how each episode of the whole series has a thread from beginning to end, so make sure to pay close attention or you'll get lost. (speaking of Lost - same thing! ; )  Just brilliant.  John Noble is a genius. His character never waivers and is so lovable as Walter Bishop (from the 1st Universe) he makes me cry, laugh, & think big time!<br />Astrid, AKA: Astrix, Ostrich, Astro, etc., is absolutely adorable, and the relationship between her & Walter is incredibly dear.<br />This show is a trip, a fantastic ride and very addicting!
B008469DGY|4.0|The game is fun to pass the time. The only complaint I might have is that there are not a lot of holes to play. Other than that I like it. Would I recommend this? Yeah I guess why not. Like I said it passes the time. So try it.
B00CF34B2I|1.0|I tried countless times trying to install this after I delete all the things I don't want on my kindle fire until I got so upset I reset my kindle nothing on it at all except what it comes with my kindle is completley stock and I keep getting the same message your kindle THERE ISNT ENOUGH SPACE IN YOUR KINDLE FIRES INTERNAL STORAGE
B000SGRONM|3.0|Classic essays of David Sedaris centered around a holiday theme. All can be found in his other books so it's probably not worth picking it up if you already have them. I can't get enough of David Sedaris though, and he is so appreciative of his fans that I pretty much pick up everything he writes out of habit.
B008469DGY|4.0|I found this game to be fun, and rather addicting. I have been playing it often. I would purchase it again.
B003YTPS7O|5.0|General, all around feel good type of movie.  Good performances by the lead actors.  Absolutey beautiful location choice, and great use of them.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|I found the story and characters to be believable and enjoyable reading. I looked forward to the rest of the series, not just the next book.
B00ENYUFYU|4.0|Great movie for a patriotic mood. Some good action and surprising turns. Recomend it for a rainy night. Not for those with weak stomachs.
1400069742|5.0|excellent coverage of an period in history. very well organized, chapters cover specific aspects, and is constantly interesting. also, the references support the subject very well (including other books I have read). This and her previous books are two of my recent favorites and she is now established as one of my favorites!<br />Richard Farmer
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|Great cast and a terrific blending of comedy and drama.  The film shows the growth in self-confidence for 2 individuals who have been successful in their careers but not in their &#34;relationship&#34; lives.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Great game. I have little to complain about. It's very addictive. Besides the loss in connection every now and then, it is a wonderful and affordable game. GO GAME LOFT!!!!!
B00B3EJ292|2.0|There is no indication in the display showing that this is not in the English language but in Italian with subtitles for the English speaking person.  Gave up on the film after a several minutes of viewing.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app. I got it because my boyfrjends mom git it for our nieces and she plays it more
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|another Sedaris book that I recommend. If you are a fan of David Sedaris, then this book will not disappoint.
B0020BUWX2|3.0|This book was good but slow. The ending wasn't a shocker but did end just like that. Overall it was a 3.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|I saw this (twice) live in Los Angeles. I miss the chandelier falling and I guess what they did was the best they could do but maybe they should have staged this in a venue where the chandelier could fall. Also, I generally collect only original Broadway cast musicals, and I disagree with the criticism of Sarah Brightman. She will always be Christine to me. Other than this nitpicking this is far and away the best Phantom ever committed to film -- probably the definitive  version if you love the Phantom (or even mildly like it) buy this.
B001DRF84W|5.0|A must have movie for any Marvel Comic Book fan.  The special effects are awesome, the acting and characters were well portrayed and far exceeded the reviews from critics.
B00DW36G32|5.0|Really gives you feelings about war.  I highly recommend this movie it's action and keeps you on the edge of your seat.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Visually pleasing (of course, from Baz Luhrmann), but just dragged on slowly. It also seemed to way over simplify the story - it was way more of a straight-forward boy meets girl, boy loses girl, boy tries to get her back and things go bad... not the complex great American novel I remember it being.
1455809683|5.0|I saw the movie twice and loved it.<br />I enjoyed the book more.<br />I think I will get part 2 next.<br />The recording was perfect, no problems, skips or drop outs.<br />Keep up the great products.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I bought this game for my son and he loved it. He found it a bit unnerving Lol but extremely fun.
B00A9ET4MC|4.0|Interesting read and insight into life of immigrants to U.S. Discussion of race here was sometimes hard to read but enlightening.  Sometimes The reading dragged a bit but overall very readable.
B00E0MCYPS|4.0|It was an alright game but I want more graphics more cars more competitors great game though but not like the other games
B000I0XLYO|4.0|like others have said.<br />It was more entertaining than I expected - I don't like slapstick and cliches so nice that this had a little more original joke lines and the character acting was good
B009UX2YAC|5.0|With this game me and my LIL sis play it every chance we get and we play it till the battery goes out
B00C0QOZP8|5.0|I expected HoGaB part 2 to be less good than the first, but I am happily surprised by how they incorporated aspects of part 1 into this new album. If I had to choose, I'd have to say I like this one even better! I've always loved Stone Sour, and they didn't disappoint with this one.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|I don't care what others said regarding the plot. I enjoyed quite alot the &#34;magic&#34; of this movie. My recommendation is to lay back, enjoy the movie and remember, this is just a motion picture, it doesn't need to be &#34;real&#34;.<br /><br />The direction, production and script were all satisfying for me and I would watch it again, if I had the chance.
B000O8OTNC|1.0|İt is Chinese made, and quality of the item is so poor. Carbide metal is not totally carbide, seems as if it is welded or glued a small<br />piece on carbide metals.
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|I had heard this movie was reminiscent of Stand By Me and I can see how people may think that as it focuses on two young boys that stumble onto something secret and have an adventure unbenownst to most everyone. I have to be honest, I wanted to see this movie because Matthew McConaughey is hot! And he didn't disappoint, hot as usual and such a good actor. You really believe he could easily be Mud. All the acting was really good but I wish Reese Witherspoon had a bigger part. It was nice to see her in an edgy role like this.<br />The scenery was beautiful in a sad sort of way, if that makes sense. How the people live and have to survive was a little depressing but works with the tone of the movie. I do wish they would have dug a little deeper into the characters more. I think that would have given it much more depth.<br />Overall worth the $5 to watch it!
B00821OX98|5.0|The cast was very well put together and the action kept me coming back for more.  I can't wait for season 3 to come to amazon.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|I ordered this album off Amazon instant download.  The download process was quick and easy.  I didn't have any issues.  The quality of the songs are great.  No complaints here.
B00CL68BK2|3.0|It was good but the ending was very predictable.  It's worth watching but was disappointed because I expected more from it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This show is so addiciting. It is well written and acted and especially intriguing for me with a mother in-law who is British :)
1452115567|5.0|Great book.  Makes me smile with every turn of the page. Check out thiswildidea.com for more of Theron and Maddie's adventures.
B00280LYHS|5.0|It was a very good book and the series was like other series I've read so it was interesting. This was a book series more people should read
B00DJ735KI|5.0|All of the 'spiritual' concepts and information discussed in this book have been part of my belief system for the better part of my 60+ years.  A heartfelt thanks to Mr Lipton for providing an understanding of the mechanics as to how the spirit me interfaces with, and defines, the physical me.  My life is now brighter and lighter than it has been in a long long time.  Everyone should read this book.  It won't change your life but it will help you understand how to change it for yourself.
1602838011|3.0|I give three stars because the story was incomplete. It was read well but the story stopped at disc 11. This audio book is supposed to have 12 CDs to complete the story and one PDF CD which is the book to be read. That is not the case. When I discovered the discrepency I sent it back and was sent a replacement. The replacement was identical to the one I sent back. I sent the replacement back as well since I was not going to be able to complete listening to the story. Whoever packages this should make sure that all CDs are included.
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|Just not a very good movie, very predictable,  In places you could very easily see what was coming next, very few if any real surprises. Some good special effects in places, but not enough to rise above 2 stars.
1609613937|5.0|I had been watching many videos on vegetarian health on youtube and ran across the good Dr. talking about how starch is so healthy. I have to admit it was all the \\"extra stuff\\" I put on my potatoes and rice etc. that was causing the problems. Eating all the processed so called \\"healthy vegan\\" is not so very healthy at all.  Whole food is the best.  It gives me the energy I need. My focus is much stronger. Kids do much better in school now. Everyone is dropping off the unwanted toxic fat with ease. Even though we still eat some meat and very little dairy, incorporating the starches and veggies into our diet has made such an amazing change in our lives. We are slowly weaning ourselves off animal meat & by products easily.  Many days we eat only starch and veggies and we know how much better we feel.  Still working on the mind set of eating animal meat and by products, we are finding it is really only a bad habit. Soon the spell will be broken. Much healing has begun in my knees and back. Migraines are going away. More energy and not moody like I used to be and I sleep very well now. I could go on, but this review is getting quite lengthy.  Just buy it and start the change, you don't have to go,(whole hog), just start and ease your way into fully doing the starch solution, just like me and my husband and 2 kids. We are very happy and satisfied customers!!!
B002Z8IWMS|5.0|Simple and straightforward... Just like a Steve Jobs presentation. Gallo did a superb job finding the common elements in Jobs speeches.

B001MM28JG|5.0|Best movie ever! Well, at least in my top twenty that I'm willing to watch again and again and again.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|while keeping sharp style in charachter description and interactions, there are obvious problems with keeping the narrative dynamic and engaged. most probably the weekest of all the volumes
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|I was a little let down with the acting. I expected more from the chosen characters, and all I saw was forced acting to fit into a period they obviously were unaware of. If you were going to use this period and choose the music you did, perhaps you could have made more of a cinematic presence. The music and scenery was so wasted in this piece. The actors could have studied more of what they were getting into. They all had it in them, they just chose lazy instead.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|One of the beset pieces of real history I've ever read.  Lincoln was an amazing person.  Wish we had someone like taht in today's world, but he was one in a billion, at least.  Doris Kearns Goodwin obvioulsy worked hard on this and it shows.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I bought the Chromecast because I have decided I don't need cable TV any more and was looking for ways to use by big flat screen TV to watch the shows that I normally view on my Ipad.  I saw the reviews for the Chromecast, bought one, plugged it in, spent 5 minutes  setting it up and bam! I'm watching Netflix, YouTube and browsing newsclips from my Barcalounger lounger! Can't wait for Hulu and other services to join the bandwagon.
B003B02OOG|5.0|I loved these stories and wished there were more!  Grisham presents an excellent representation of characters and stories for all to enjoy.
0553825534|2.0|I have read many of lee child's books but this one was a real disappointment.  The first half was good but as I read on I skipped pages that were not necessary in the book.  Seemed like hevwas just filling in pages.  Do not buy or waste precious time reading it.

B00DJYJQ36|5.0|I'm a guy.<br /><br />And I don't tend to watch chick flicks- well, this isn't a chick flick at all.<br /><br />It is a stunning movie.<br /><br />Especially if you watch it in sequence after the first two.<br /><br />Each person who watches will learn something; and something different than everyone else who watches.
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|Hard to follow the story. Have to admit I was not able to stay awake for the entire movie. Too bad.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|great game lots of fun cant stop playing I'm addicted.  have told all my friends about it so that they can play
B00C5R8364|4.0|Always expect meticulous scrutiny of facts, processes, and events. Forsyth's characters are almost always archetypes that you would recognize anywhere - the meat is in the exhaustively researched technologies, practices, locations and situations.<br /><br />Not 'Day of the Jackal&#34;, but what ever could be?
B005DF2QMC|2.0|The player worked initially, but quickly developed a background noise problem.  I ave not solved this problem yet.  It was rather disappointing.
1603427244|4.0|It does have every thing you need to know about cast on and bind off, now I have to figure what they are talking about,  It does not explain enough to me but I read it and hopefully I will understand.  This book is not for a novice.

B005OZE9SA|5.0|This little red box will make your recording life so much easier - and probably stir up some envy among those who hear what a difference the Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 makes! By reducing my sound chain - voice over life is GOOD!

B00CTT9646|1.0|This review applies to the limited edition Gift Set Only.<br /><br />The Phaser is nicely weighted and looks goods from a distance. That is the end of the positives.<br /><br />The \\"screen authentic\\" is a complete misnomer. Despite a CLEARLY indicated battery compartment for a \\"T1 battery only,\\", that is sealed shut, as are every button and control. This is NOT like the screen authentic Star Wars light sabers, which have functional buttons and which light up like the movie versions. Despite showing the Phaser in Chris Pine's hand \\"lit up\\" on the cover of the box, I suppose we are to think that the glowing front of the Phaser was entirely CGI? This is garbage and is being returned due to false advertising by Amazon!

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I thought that Dragon vale is really fun especially the breeding part and there always coming out with new and seasonal dragons.
B003KRLKHC|5.0|This movie was action filled, dramatic, and emotional. The story touches on a deep level, and if you are religious in an way it is one you can really connect with. The streaming quality is awesome as well! I had no trouble buffering this on a PS3 console. I would definitely rent this again! I also recommend to pay the extra dollar to rent it in HD. This is one of those kinds of movies where it's a lot better to see things in HD clarity.
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|I knew when I heard Sheryl Crow was making a move to country music that I was going to buy the album anyway. I've never loved country, there have been the exceptions of course, but over all it's not the love of my life when it comes to music. Still, I was hesitant 'Easy' didn't scare me, it sounded like standard issue Sheryl Crow and that's what this album is.<br /><br />The country producers and song writers are here to spin Sheryl's style, but they by no means direct it. Very country sounding songs such as 'Homecoming Queen' and 'Stay at Home Mother' are brought down to a standard issue Sheryl Crow album level. There is none of the trailer trash, effervescence that Miranda Lambert would have given us on similarly titled songs. At times there are falters as such as the featured song 'Shotgun'- which has a 'Fastest Girl In Town' feel without pulling it through (I'm praying they don't send it to radio), and certainly 'Give it to Me' has it's historonics but I still like it.<br /><br />A few of the songs harken back to previous Sheryl Crow hits like 'Picture' and 'All I Wanna Do' with shocking parallels, but she never makes it feel tired. I don't think Sheryl pushed the country envelope (Thank God) as far as she could have, but for any faults the album has I question the influence of the songwriters and producers. With Sheryl walking into uncharted territory it was their job to guide her and on some of the songs they let her slip. This is a necessary album for any Sheryl Crow fan and something any country fan should at least take a cursory glance at. A surprisingly coherent and wonderful album.<br /><br />Sheryl proves that the 90's were by no means her best and that she has the staying power she proved throughout the 00's with 'Always By Your Side' and 'Soak Up The Sun'. 'Easy' is just the start of Sheryl's new decade.

B000HKYOK0|5.0|The original series is still the best.  Groundbreaking in so many ways, WAY ahead of its time...  Even as dated as the effects and some framing seem, these are still great to watch.  This was the first TV show my entire family (5 of us) all watched together during its first run.  It was also the first show I remember us pausing at the end of some episodes and saying to each other, &#34;Wow - THAT was a good one!&#34; Fairly often.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|The story tugged at ny heart.

B000AJIF4E|5.0|The most underrated yet the most productive and quality headphones you can mind in the market today. Considering this one is only worth $77.95, it is very cheap but worth. Worth way better than Beats which are no lesser than $199, which is pretty idiotic because of the price and the hype about it is very laughable. Beats are too overpriced overrated honestly because Beats are nothing but a trend thing and that's why you see people walking around with those. Beats doesn't even come close to the sound quality and comfort to Sony MDR-7506. These headphones were actually first released in the early 90s and I remember we used to have these at my old house when I was a little kid but back then I was little and stupid so I had no idea about. We ended up giving these phenomenal headphones to my dad's friend's family....I know sad story but I'm glad I found these headphones again and I'm happy that I was reunited with this spectacular piece of technology once again. Imho, the best headphones on the planet and I highly recommend this one to anyone who's unsure about buying a quality pair of headphones. Trust me you'll love it.

B00D2JDNQ4|5.0|What an amazing book. It kept me intrigued from start to finish and stimulated me to read a little about the zodiac signs along the way. I cannot comment on the historical accuracy but it certainly seemed to convey the atmosphere of gold rush days in the southern island of NZ.  Someone once said of films, they should have a beginning, a middle and and end but not necessarily in that order.  This book has a compelling story to tell and uses the non linear approach to great effect. Its long but so enthralling that I hardly noticed the time I was submerged in this tale of the colour. Some of the observations seem almost too wise for such a young writer and one can only be in awe at the achievement. I think this book will become recognised as a masterpiece and that the author is destined for a stellar future.

B00E3D7WGU|4.0|Madonna's a bit past her salad days on the pop charts and although [[ASIN:B00756GKBA MDNA]] wasn't well received commercially or critically her live shows are still amongst the best out there.  With 30 years of hits to draw off of Madonna could easily go the \\"oldies\\" route but has steadfastly refused, instead reworking, reinventing, remaking, and remodeling older hits to bring them into the present, blending well with more recent and current tracks.  As witnessed during her Superbowl appearance she's fearless at changing things up musically and remaining au courant.  The changing economics for musicians means tours make the big money and albums are the loss leaders; unlike the way things were when Madonna started out.  With the [[ASIN:B00756GKBA MDNA]] release as her excuse to tour she set out to pack stadiums across the globe as usual, mixing up new tracks with a smattering of her bigger hits and the \\"MDNA Tour\\" serves up quite a few biggies (\\"Papa Don't Preach\\", \\"Hung Up\\", \\"Express Yourself\\", \\"Open Your Heart\\", \\"Justify My Love\\"' \\"Vogue\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"Like a Prayer\\") reworked to make them more contemporary.  If anything the live versions improve upon the studio versions of [[ASIN:B00756GKBA MDNA]] giving them more life and vitality.  And this is closer to a true \\"live\\" album as it's fairly clear there were minimal or no overdubs and tweaking to make sure everything sounds perfect.  Still you've got to give it up to a 55 year old mother who can pump the crowd up and pack the dance floor and Madonna's working it as hard as peers half her age.  Truthfully, Madonna's live shows are a visual experience so the audio doesn't really give you a sense of how exciting the concert was.  Likewise, breaking it up into individual tracks like you would on an iPod or iTunes makes it a bit jarring; it's more of a set piece to listen to from start to finish.  Individually the tracks are stunning but there's a certain sense that the frequency with which Madonna is releasing live recordings that she's buying more and more time to record a new studio album.  That said, the \\"MDNA Tour\\" is a nice reminder that Madonna is still relevant and breaking new ground as an artist.<br /><br />Now to address some of the complaints in other reviews about the mix and the sound quality, which has been described as tinny, brassy, shrill, distorted or thin, especially when compared to bootleg copies.  The first question I would ask is whether these reviewers went to the concert or not, and if they bought [[ASIN:B00756GKBA MDNA]] or not.  Madonna is making more use of auto-tuning on some tracks and as a result the mix on those tracks has to be altered otherwise the vocals are drowned out by the backing music.  This is just the shift and change in modern music and what Madonna's doing.  I heard the same complaints on [[ASIN:B000KGGLCU The Confessions Tour - Live from London (CD+DVD)]] when it came out in 2007 and truthfully it sounded pretty close to what the concert sounded like and that's the same case here.  This isn't the Madonna of the Blonde Ambition Tour circa 1990 and quite honestly this has been a frequent complaint related to not only Madonna's live recordings, but her studio work, and especially her singles mixes.  This isn't an apologia but an acknowledgement that music changes and evolves...the current trend is towards heavier treble and lighter base, which I might point out, sounds better on iPods which most people will be listening to this on.  Coincidence, brilliance, or just plain smart?  Knowing it's Madonna I can tell you it's NOT a coincidence!ive recordings that she's buying more and more time to record a new studio album.

B00DSTBMMU|4.0|The idea of Sheryl Crow doing a Country album is at once a no-brainer and yet a risky gamble.  Crow's been serving up country-tinged pop and rock since she started out with [[ASIN:B000002G1T Tuesday Night Music Club]] so the idea of going full tilt country is hardly something out of left field.  Crow's success on the Pop and Adult Contemporary charts has been waning in recent years so a switch to Country makes some sense and who's to say she can't still cross over to the Pop and Adult Contemporary charts?  The risk for Crow is that Country, especially Country radio stations, doesn't always embrace crossover artists.  Even artists sincere about embracing Country can have a tough time, although Darius Rucker's success in Country shows this may be changing.  At no point is there a \\"what was she thinking\\" moment as she makes for a pretty compelling and polished Country singer with her gorgeous silky voice; and that's a blessing and a curse.  Country today is tending towards rougher and rawer; not exactly the first things you think of with Sheryl Crow.  Her lyrics can have directness, bite and an edge, but her voice doesn't always.  Her vocals are mixed up front and center and she certainly sounds right for the part, even sounding a bit edgy at times.  Most of the songs are up tempo numbers that certainly sound right for Country radio, but oddly enough I found I liked the slower tracks like \\"Homesick\\" and \\"Stay at Home Mother\\" which were more intimate and lyrically deeper and more resonant.  \\"Waterproof Mascara\\", co-written with Brad Paisley is a likely single and I'm willing to bet there's likely to be others here that will succeed.  Overall Crow feels at home in a Country setting and this doesn't strike me as mere dilettantism but a move into Country and away from Pop and Rock as was the case with Darius Rucker.  For me and probably a lot of people Crow is more of a singles artist than an artist whose whole album you'll listen too and it's really no different with \\"Feels Like Home\\".  I certainly liked it and it seems to fit in with contemporary Country music, but I'm not sure how well Crow will be embraced and succeed.  Part of the problem may be the tendency to compare what Crow is doing here with her bigger hit singles in Pop and Rock, which admittedly isn't fair, but people will do it nonetheless.  Breaking into a new genre of music isn't easy and Crow is about to find out whether she will gain acceptance or not.  As charming and personable as she is I have a sneaking hunch she may succeed.ls Like Home\\".

B0011NVC98|5.0|I remember seeing this movie years ago in theaters, having never read the poem. Dialogue flew by me, the 3-D glasses disoriented me, I didn't understand why the movie makers slowed the pace by having Angelina Jolie play Grendel's mother.<br /><br />When I finally did read the poem recently, I scoffed at what I remembered this movie being.<br /><br />However, upon reading the poem several times and supplementary material as well, I thought I could get a lot more from a re-viewing of this movie, and so I have watched it again. And I am pleasantly surprised!<br /><br />What I liked about the movie:<br /><br />The general outline of Beowulf's life and works in the poem is adhered to by the film: fame-seeking youth, monster slayer, king, old king, and death, with the major events hit upon along the way.<br /><br />What I especially liked was how the movie takes several circumstances in the poem that exist without explanation and uses them as opportunities for further exploration into the characters, for example that Beowulf has no children. To take another example, in the poem, Hrothgar (a straightforward good and noble king who remains King when Beowulf leaves his land, unlike in the movie) delivers a solemn, cautionary speech to Beowulf about the dangers of earthly riches upon the latter's victory over the monsters, which some have viewed as being oddly out of place. Well, this movie provides a reason why Hrothgar might have delivered that speech.<br /><br />Regarding the \\"monsters\\", it should be said that the book pretty much portrays them as 2-Dimensional cyborgs.John Gardner in his 1971 novel \\"Grendel\\" was the first to present them as more fully rounded, sympathetic characters. The film follows Gardner in having them be something more than convenient fodder for Beowulf.<br /><br />Portraying an AAA+ actress as Grendel's mother didn't strike me as the typical Hollywood fool's choice, sacrificing quality for star-power, that it once did. The movie makes clear that beneath the beauty she IS a monster.<br /><br />The poem has this definite quality to it that a reader can perceive as an awkward incompleteness that arose when the pagan legends were translated into a Christian setting. The problem can be summed up as: how celebrate heroic violence and earthly glory when the religion is against both? The poem attempts to solve this by portraying Beowulf as a Christian crusader and his monstrous enemies as descendants of Cain, whereas the movie more explicitly shows the culture in transition and factors in Beowulf's own actions to create a smoother transition from Pagan to Christian. I think that the changes made in the movie go a long way toward providing a \\"natural\\" quality to the story that the poem lacks. (Although I will not say that it improves upon the poem. The poem is great in its own way, by itself).<br /><br />Things I didn't like or that I thought the movie should have included make for a short list. Censorship being what it is, the decision to strip the hero hide-naked before the big fight seems like an odd way for the movie-makers to handicap themselves (were 3-D man-butts that much of a selling point?). Secondly, the themes in the poem of blood-feuds and the code of comitatus should have been included to strengthen the bond to the heroic age.<br /><br />In conclusion, both the poem and movie seem to explore the same or similar themes in different ways, and I think having read and watched both has enhanced my enjoyment of both.
B001V7UXG2|5.0|Disclosure - I am a huge fan of Fry and Laurie and enjoy just about anything these two incredibly talented individuals put their hands to. That said this series is fabulous and ranks among my favorites because it is so  well acted and wonderfully written and it captures a time period and a social milieu that is skewered to great effect in the PG Wodehouse novels on which it is based perfectly. Basically for the uninitiated, Jeeves is a remarkably clever and understated Gentlemen's gentlemen in the employ of Bertie Wooster who embodies the young leisured class. A young man with money  and endless time on his hands played brilliantly by Laurie.<br />The theme music is infectious, the sets and costuming are right on the money and overall this is just great intelligent comedy .

B0081336FO|5.0|Each episode is better than the last! I can't even talk my family into watching this because they know they will become sucked into the series too. Watch at your own risk!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Excellent.  Entrancing.  Well acted. Highly recommended.  I absolutely love that is is relatively unpredictable.  The characters are easy to relate to despite their profession.  Less about the law,  more about the human aspects,  which I appreciate.
B0029EDMEG|4.0|These Selleck-produced and acted movies are not comparable to first-rate, high budget movies, but they use beautiful New England settings, nice looking actors who do a credible job. The script follows the writer Robert Parker's dialog and style closely, although I am sorry it is sparse on the humor that Parker often used. I don't think the novels were quite as dark and brooding.<br /><br />Jesse Stone has problems but in the novels, he's not quite so sad and flawed.<br /><br />Like most Selleck-influenced work, these movies are moral tales: portrayals of people being good, with traditional values, being kind, honest and doing the right thing.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|It's so awesome and I don't stop playing the game I love this  game so much!<br /><br /> It's better than my other shooting games!
B000OVLINI|5.0|Do not read this book until you are prepared to wander the streets of a hardened Barcelona.  If you accept the challenge you will meet a richly drawn cast of characters, a plot that evolves with each page, and a story layered as richly as a wedding cake.  I felt as if I, too, were seeing the darkness, possessed by the spirit of a secret book depository.  The illustrator created what I consider to be one of the finest covers ever presented.<br /><br />Is it fantasy, historical romance or mystery?  Only you, as the reader came decide.  Happy reading!

B008JGSM6G|5.0|There's not a lot to say about Flow Free, simply because it does what a free-to-play app should. There's a lot of free content, the ads are minimal and unobtrusive, and the pay content is reasonably priced. The basic design is familiar: you connect same-colored dots on square grids to fill the grid without crossing any lines. A perfect score requires making each connection in a single continuous stroke, though you can change the path in mid-stroke provided you don't lift your finger from the screen. The smaller puzzles, 5x5 and 6x6 grids, are easy and don't take long, but by the time you get to 9x9 and 10x10 grids, each one requires more effort. Like most simple touchscreen games, it's surprisingly addictive.<br /><br />The free version includes 750 puzzles in five packs of 150: two with puzzles ranging from 5x5 to 9x9, a tablet pack of 10x10 to 14x14, and two dedicated packs, all 8x8 and all 9x9. There are seven premium packs available for $0.99 each, or $3.99 for all seven. The premium packs include: two more 150-puzzle packs for 5x5 to 9x9, a 120-pack of 5x5 to 9x9, a dedicated pack of 150 10x10, a child-oriented pack of 120 5x5 and 6x6 boards, and two more tablet packs of 10x10 to 14x14. That's nearly 1000 more puzzles, not bad for four bucks.<br /><br />Buying any premium level pack will also turn off the ads in the app, but they're so mild that you probably won't notice them that much. Occasionally there's a takeover add that will point you toward other content from the same company or request a review, but nowhere near as often as in some free apps. There are always targeted ads along the bottom of the screen, but they're small and easy to ignore. The only drawback is that the ads being on the bottom means that they're right above the Kindle Fire's menu button, which means you may launch the ads while trying to back out. But that's a minor problem at best. If this kind of grid-filling puzzle appeals to you, Flow Free is a great choice, one of the best free games in the Amazon Appstore.mes in the Amazon Appstore.

0399159347|5.0|I have to admit, I found the beginning of this book confusing but it is absolutely worth getting through that part. The questions she brings up are riveting. What if the assumptions you make about your life suddenly and decisively are revealed to be wrong? What then? Should people stay together for the kids? What if something unthinkable is committed by someone you know well? It's so easy to demonize someone in the newspaper or on TV but when you know the person, although you may hate what they've done, does it change everything good about them? And what other endings could there have been if things had happened differently? All of that is brought up in The Husband's Secret and yet somehow it isn't oppressive. It's just brilliantly done. I loved What Alice Forgot but was not all crazy about The Hypnotist Love Story so I wasn't sure if I would like this but it was great. It makes me want to find her other books now and read them.

I ended up truly enjoying both the series and the book and am glad to have experienced both of them.

The secret Cecelia's  husband had is  more appalling than I could have imagined, and I liked him so much I hoped it wasn't true.  I was so sure that as I made my way through the pages, it would turn out to have been a mistake.  The characters were so alive and were very real.  The book was a page turner, offering deep views into the lives of women that I believe most women readers will be able to identify with. I laughed out loud, I shed some tears, and I was sad when I neared the end.  I could spend a great deal more time with these people.  Ms Moriarty can be proud of this work.
B004L0NGEC|3.0|Loved it on my computer. Unable to even access it on Kindle Fire. I wish someone would tell me how to get it. All of my pictures are there.
B00CDXOPYE|4.0|I was interested in how Julieanne Hough would do as an actress.  She did really well.  I liked the movie.  It was predictable but entertaining.<br />I ordered it in HD for my Kindle Fire and watched it on vacation in Canada.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game was super addicting finished it the first time I played. Can't wait till a second version comes out.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun and entertaining!  Really enjoy looking for the next challenge and being a part of the mystery. Lots of fun!
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|the awful reviews were right.  the artistic reviews were wrong.  worst movie I have ever seen.  I stopped it before the end and threw it in the garbage.
B005JTAP4S|5.0|It is not difficult to draw parallels between this book and Carroll's 'Alice', for O'Brien has created something equally poetic and enchanting. The book develops at a pace akin to that of a 10 year old's enquiring mind, and I lapped up the description eagerly. What is often true of self published novels is an author's propensity to write not a book but a screenplay. This author has written not only a reader's book, through and through, but also what I expect will be a contemporary classic. The prose gives credence to O'Brien's world-build, and the characters whilst wonderfully varied and uniquely voiced, are just a smidgen familiar enough to recall with fondness the books of our youth. Thank you, William.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I can't wait for season 4. I started watching Downton Abby season 1 and 2 after a number of my friends recommended it. It took my awhile to get to Season 3 but then I couldn't stop watching it. I love the attention to the clothes of the time period for both men and women and the hairstyles.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Compelling and plot-twist packed series...keeps you second and third guessing what the characters' next moves will be. Patrick J. Adams is adorable & gabriel macht incredibly sexy!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|We enjoyed the movie. The plot was different, the action was good. A little predictable in spots but I would recommend to anyone who likes science fantasy.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This was a great movie. It brings together all the back stories of each superhero into an action-packed into an entertaining show!
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Much better than the old Stallone movie - Karl Urban is excellent as Dredd, and the movie does a very good job of painting a bleak future with rampant overcrowding. This certainly won't win any awards for drama, but as far as a summer action movie, it hits all the right notes....
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game pretty darn great to play it is entertaining tricky fun hard it catches your attention keeps and you playing.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this game is great for anyone who loves horses or who wants one but can't have one. It is also very realistic. I definitely recommend this game.
B004N868DS|5.0|I didn't think a mouse pad would make a difference in the way your mouse works, but i guess I was wrong. I like it a lot and the materials used are pretty solid.
B000H4TX9I|5.0|Wish they hadn't cancelled this show....really enjoyed watching it online with Amazon Instant Video!  Plus, it was free with Prime membership...which made it even better!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Great actors; interesting story lines & characters.  Always look forward to the next episode.  It is definitely worth your television watching time.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Excellent series, in true form of British Drama, it is gritty and the characters are true to life.  The show makes you look at an issue that you would rather not consider, but it weaves in and out of the town and it's characters in an excellent fashion.  It is gripping and thrilling and keeps you enthralled.  I work in TV, and i love it!  Totally hooked.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun but a little bit too easy but overall fun fun game I love it so much get this game I mean app
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|A good book.  Took a while to read because of size but the last half was hard to put down.
B007TK77QE|5.0|Loved the narrative, such a studied observance of human thoughts.  Relevant and it took a while to read so lasted a while.
B000HL09SA|5.0|Kevin Bacon and Diane Lane offered great support, but Frankie and Skip steal the show!  The story line is thoughtful and from a very respectable and realistic dog-loving perspective.  Even the sad parts are realistic, meaningful and not overwhelming.  As told by the owner/care-giver (Frankie), the events are especially engaging.  A young child can enjoy the movie when guided by a caring adult.  And as an adult, I appreciated the side-story of redemption for  Frankie's neighbor.  I highly recommend this movie.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Well written and full of insight  from Steve and others that had an impact on his life, both good and bad.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|This movie had suspense and a great storyline. Even though there was some inappropriate language, it didn't include the 'F' word, which was really nice!
B009RH9FR6|5.0|I ordered this case and the Amazon case to see which I preferred for my Kindle Fire HD 7\\".  The Amazon case is much lighter in weight, but I actually find that to be a disadvantage.  I like that this Marware case is a little bit more sturdy and I LOVE that I can rotate between landscape and portrait positioning as I like to browse the internet in landscape, but read in portrait.  The first time you try to rotate the position into portrait is a bit scary though because it feels so stiff and like you may break it, but after you've done it a few times it's much easier.  As some others have mentioned, the case claims to be wake/sleep, but I also find that it does not always sleep upon closing.  This is not a big deal to me... if I notice it's looking bright inside my case, I just hit the button to sleep my screen.  I'm very happy with this purchase and will be mailing back my Amazon case!

B00E3D7WGU|1.0|I swear this was recorded with a potato. HORRIBLE SOUND QUALITY. Concerts from the 1970's sound better than this. She should know better. HORRIBLE. DO NOT BUY.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Have yet to meet a John Grisham book I didn't love.  This one was no exception! Well developed characters. Outstanding plot.  Perfect amount of mystery.  Never wanted to put it down. Enjoyment guaranteed.
B00BIVN82M|5.0|Whether Michael Buble is channeling his inner Frank Sinatra or Dean Martin, or is singing his own creations, there is only delight to be had.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|Pretty cool game so far, i like the safari trips and trying to save as many animals as possible.  Overall in the few sort terms that i have played it keeps my interest.  I love the fact that it is not another energy based game.
1449410243|5.0|The cat is literally out of the bag.  I had no idea there were so many ways my cats could plot to kill me.<br /><br />Find out about \\"kitty landmines\\", why kitties knead on humans, or yawn so much.  You will never think of Miss Puss as quiet and gentle again.  You've been warned!
B0090XLDKY|5.0|This is a classic movie and  I will enjoy seeing the movie from time to time.  I never get tired of seeing a movie like this over and over.
1452110581|5.0|Only a true ailurophile (cat lover to the uninitiated) could come up with so many hilarious but true observations.  The author has the brain of a cat and the vocabulary to go with it.
B00AFZ86C4|5.0|Blackfoot was essential for my high school days !! lol<br />Blackfoot Strikes is one of the BEST Rock albums of it's era.<br /> when 'My Sharona' was being pounded down our throats and the synthesized bands were dominating the airwaves... BLACKFOOT STRIKES !!! HA-SO !!<br />Yes, indeed !<br />Good ol' blistering Blue Jean southern rock from these indian guys from the Blackfoot Tribe of South Dakota cut a wedge through the BS - (if only for a short time)... but it was a shot of Testosterone fueled Rock to remember forever.<br /><br />It's is always good to have a few of their tunes spliced into your house party play lists, and this is the definitive Blackfoot set to have.

B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love Facebook. It lets me keep in touch with out of state friends and family. I would reccommend Facebook to all adults. I think it is too risky for children as witnessed on news accounts of missing children and also due to bullying.
B005VC4FLW|5.0|It was a very good movie have seen it like 30 times I dont think you can go wrong with it it's funny dramatic and confident all at the same time
B00D3S1QD6|2.0|It was basically a 2 week trial...and I wasn't impressed.  Sure I got to hear myself snore but I didn't understand most of what it was recording other than noise.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|EVERYONE in my Book Club enjoyed the latest by &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; author, although some observed that the plot(s) and multiplicity of characters was a tad confusing; however....all came together at the end, tied up neatly with a bow!
0307341577|5.0|Of her three books, I read Gone Girl first and I didn't expect Dark Places to live up to it. I was pleasantly surprised, and I actually ended up liking this novel better much more than Gone Girl! It was incredibly suspenseful. I am in love with her writing style and her ability to have you convinced who the perpetrator is throughout the book, only to surprise you in the end. She really had me connected with the main character and the story. Great read!
B004Y5AV4M|5.0|Georgette Heyer at the top of her game ; should be required reading for every book club!<br /><br />Best part....this is just one in a series of her great books.
0307341550|2.0|I am sad to say that this book was a major disappointment compared to Gillian Flynn's other two novels. Gone Girl and Dark Places were both incredibly suspenseful and had you really connected to both main characters. What I appreciate most about her writing is that she has you convinced you know who the perpetrator is in both stories, only to surprise you again and again throughout the novels.<br /><br />However, I can't quite say the same for Sharp Objects. There were several things about it that I disliked from the get go. The beginning was extremely rushed and I didn't feel like I knew the main character at all. The story was really dark and not in the way that her other two novels are. This story was dark in a way that made me sick to my stomach for a variety of reasons; most of which I can't share without giving the story away. The cutting issue was a little beyond. I also guessed who the killer was within the first few chapters because it was really easy to tell- so I essentially wasted my time reading the rest of the book.<br /><br />I would save my time and money and stick to her other novels, personally. I really did not care much for the book at all and it really does not compare to the others.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Very interesting and entertaining show! The stories and actors are all fantastic, and I always find myself wanting to watch just one more episode.
142314189X|5.0|My grandson loved it!  We read it every night before bed.  His 4 year old sister was listening too.  Always happy to buy them books!
B005PK57IK|5.0|Every season of this show that I have watched so far has been fantastic. So glad I stumbled upon it!

B000I0XLYO|1.0|Very very very very much a waste of time, do not bother with this one folks, go fly a kite instead.
B00C28J2VQ|4.0|The 3 D effects made this movie so much more fun than the first one. Thought I would have to try to make it look like I was having fun but really did enjoy this one.
B000I3UMLQ|3.0|This is a good movie, but it does not compare with the recent new Star Trek movies at all in terms of writing and acting. And the new ones aren't amazing. Hence only three stars.<br />But I like these movies a lot.
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|Aside from the lack of special features, I preordered this bluray a long time ago expecting it on the release day as promised. Well the night before release they have my status as shipping soon (which it said all weekend) and the delivery date changed from the release date, the 10th, to the 12th. I am a prime member so I don't get a refund I guess for the delay, and when I wrote them about this I received a vague response telling me that it is expected to arrive the 12th, as if I can't read that, and sorry. They made it sound as if that was always the expected delivery date.<br /><br />For this or any film, don't expect their guarantee to be for certain of receiving it on the release date. A prime membership will also only get you nothing in return, at least as a regular customer they have to refund shipping.<br /><br />For Star Trek, go over to Best Buy or Target, they have a bonus disc of material and you can be sure that when you purchase it you won't get it days later.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I was so psyched to use this headset, being my first surround sound gaming headset.<br /><br /> However, after installing the driver software(that was actually quite nice to the point where I almost gave 2 stars for this review) and started using it, I was onset by pounding migraines. Not to mention, no matter how I fussed with the settings, the bass would crunch so hard it was almost a joke - adding more to the pain of the migraine. Taking them off made the headaches pass quickly.<br /><br />The design is tasteful, the buttons and microphone functional and the driver comprehensive. However, I can't recommend a piece of headwear that felt so painful to use.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|I had the best time with this game. It is interesting and very fun. I would recommend. Purchase it today.
B003JH8LPW|5.0|I love the pace of Dan Browns Thrillers they take you through 24 hrs of exciting drama and intrigue. Love it!

B00AQM8H9I|2.0|Was fun to play a couple times. Understood the concept but never got good at it. Some of the challenges were impossible.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love (and am addicted to) Pinterest.  It lets me organize, all in one place all the recipes, design ideas and assorted info that I use to tear out of magazines and put in folders that I rarely looked at unless I was looking for a particular thing--which many times I could not locate again.  With Pinterest--my recipes and ideas are always at my fingertips in my virtual file cabinet that is always neat!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|More people are on this for sharing items. Multiple ways to get bonuses and collectibles. Only thing that would make it better is being able to send items without having to friend like in Farmville.
B007C7UZIG|5.0|I use this app to check on steam sales when im away at work, or to chat with my son when he is on.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Right from the start I couldn't put it down! It wasn't predictable at all. Even though I didn't get the ending I was hoping for it was still great!
B00DJFIMW6|2.0|I wasn't interested in this game. Looks well done with voices and animation. This was a free one on amazon's free app a day so I tried it. Then removed it. More likely fun for young'uns.
0525478817|4.0|I'm not sure if I'm just a cry-baby or this book really has the power to pull every emotional string I have. It's an absolute tear-jerker and I'm glad that this is the first John Green book I've read. Not only has it tackled a situation being experienced in real life but it was given justice by the teen characters portraying the role. It feels like you're either Hazel Grace or Augustus Waters and you're actually in their shoes feeling and experiencing everything. You'll actually feel the enormity of the sufferings any cancer patient has to face fighting for their right to live. Some parts may tend to get boring especially if it is mostly conversations, but if you'll actually focus on the scenarios and put yourself into it you'll be just fine until the next big scene. I highly recommend this book to those people thinking that they have the biggest problem in the world or those who wanted to end their life because of its utter wretchedness. This book will made you think twice knowing someone out there is praying to have even an extra minute to live.
0142419850|5.0|This book is amazing!  I found this to be the best of the series.  Some big twists and turns to keep you on your toes and wondering what comes next. I would recommend this book to all tweens and teens.
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|Both of these movies are excellent and full of entertainment from start to the end. Run Silent Run Deep, came in a foreign language and also would not play in my DVD.
078322804X|5.0|My all time favorite film.  Hilarious no matter how many times you watch it, and it has the best music; you just can't help but sing and dance in your seat.  My family and I like to watch it outdoors on a big screen, using a projector; so much fun!
5028836043|4.0|Scanners is an absolute classic. This title is only available in Region 2 so ensure your equipment is compatible before you purchase it. Scanners is one of the top 1980s horror films (with a 1970s tone), in the Top 100 horror movies of all time with a great director, dramatic cast, wonderfully overpowering score and awesome special effects that still look very good. A Scanners Collection would be great on Blu-ray (including Scanners I-III, Scanner Cop and Scanners: The Showdown). There is over an hour of total bonus content. Note that the original Scanners is rumored to be coming courtesy of the Criterion Collection so US fans may want to purchase that version instead.<br /><br />Special Features:<br />My Art Keeps Me Sane (1080i/60, 24 min)<br />The Eye of Scanners (HD, 15 min)<br />The Chaos of Scanners (HD, 14 min)<br />Exploding Brains & Popping Veins (1080i/60, 10 min)<br />Bad Guy Dane (1080i/60, 5 min)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00D97DMBU Scanners II: The New Order / Scanners III: The Takeover (BluRay/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray]]] is now available for American customers. You are getting 2 films for the price of one in this package. This set is for fans only because the picture and audio transfers are fairly average and there are no bonus features. Scanners II is about a corrupt police commander (Yvan Ponton) who decides to use the scanners to help take over the city and manages to convince evil scientist Dr Morse (Tom Butler) to help him. Morse has plans to use a new mind-controlling drug on the telepaths, but has not reckoned with a rogue scanner who is determined to stop them. Scanners III is about young Helena Monet (Liliana Komorowska) who has exceptional telepathic abilities, but when she tries an experimental drug developed by her father she turns into a deranged killer, using her abilities to cut a murderous swathe to the top of her father's pharmaceutical company. On her quest to dominate the world, Helena takes over a television station, and the only man who can stop her is her scanner brother Alex, recently returned from honing his skills in a Thai monastery.op her is her scanner brother Alex, recently returned from honing his skills in a Thai monastery.

B00EV1KT4Q|3.0|This comedy franchise is now available in a box set. The picture and audio quality are superb for the sequels (although the original film could use a good remastering). While all previously released supplements are included with a new documentary (over 3 hours of total bonus content) it would have been nice to get audio commentaries and new featurettes for the top-grossing R-Rated franchise in history. The unrated cut of the original film that adds 8 minutes of dialogue is included. The first film is by far the best while the second seems like a remake. The third film veers off course and doesn't have that many laughs.<br /><br />Video Resolution/Codec: 1080p/AVC MPEG-4   Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1<br />Audio Formats: English DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1, French 5.1 Dolby Digital, Spanish 5.1 Dolby Digital<br />Subtitles/Captions: English SDH, French, Spanish<br /><br />Bonus Content:<br />Hangover I [38 min.]: Featurettes, Gag Reel, Still Gallery<br />Hangover II [42 min.]: Comedy Rhythm of Todd Phillips, Not Your Everyday Monkey, Bangkok Tour with Mr. Chow, Action Mash-Up, Hangover 2 Laugh Track, Gag Reel<br />Hangover III [34 min.]: Replacing Zach: The Secret Auditions, The Wolfpack's Wildest Stunts, Pushing the Limits, Inside Focus: The Real Chow, Zach Galifianakis In His Own Words, Action Mash-Up, Extended Scenes, Outtakes<br />Wolfpack Only - The Hangover Retrospective [70 min.]: The definitive outrageous story including Zach's unlikely audition as &#34;Alan,&#34; the truth behind Ed Helms' missing tooth, the casting of a drug-dealing monkey and the wildly improbable rendezvious with a former president.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I watched The Piano Guys on a video and was blown away.  What I really wanted was to see a bunch of videos or, better yet, a live concert in my home town.  But instead I settled for a CD which seemed to be representative of their talent.  I am so pleased and not in the lease disappointed.  Their talent far exceeds their stage presence to perfect the joy of listening just as well as watching.  I would love to see them, but there is no doubt that I will enjoy every album they put out.

B008Y2FRFO|1.0|Yes, the app is free, but you have to purchase coins to continue to plat. I got this game for my husband, who adores this game. He was so dissapointed when he played the first game, and then he was instructed to purchase coins to continue. This fact should be in the description of the game. Dissapointed, deleted the game.
B001AOKA3W|4.0|Very different -- reminded me of the way they filmed &#34;Blair Witch&#34;  -- it looked very realistic. The actors all did a great job.
B00EVLU2F2|5.0|This is the album I've been waiting for Goldfrapp to release since I first became a superfan with the amazing Felt Mountain back in the winter of 2000. Have all the records, seen them/her many times live, blah blah. To my mind, there are two distinct Goldfrapp personas: the moody chanteuse of Felt Mountain and the Wicker Man inspired, psychedelic Seventh Tree, and the icy disco diva of the superb, late night in '80s Berlin sounding Black Cherry, and Supernature. Must admit that their last outing though, the uninspired Head First, made me question their intentions - possibly forsaking artistry to sell big in the US. Really found that release depressing, both superficial and false.<br /><br />But now here is the cinematic and intense, delicate and lyrical Tales of Us. One part John Barry orchestral, another part Cocteau Twins fizzy vocals, with a healthy dose of early 70s softcore movie soundtrack (think Emmanuelle or Bilitis) in the mix too. But unmistakably Goldfrapp, truly showcasing the unique talents of these impeccable musicians. Maybe not your sound if you're looking for another Strict Machine or Ooh La La. But if you're a fan of the chanteuse, of songs like Pilots, Hairy Trees and (a great b-side) All Night Operator, then you're going to flip for this release.
B00DQVSTCG|1.0|This is scandalous!!!!!!!!! How something like this can be released!? Issues:<br />Audio (in 5.1 setting): There is no sound from rear right speaker and the sound from the front right one is also very low. Sound is in general of very poor quality, no bass (no LFE), tons of echo!!!<br />Video: This is unwatchable! My iPhone takes better videos during the concerts. It is unbearably grainy! I even played her Sticky and Sweet blu-ray for comparison and the quality of that one was soooo much better. How could they release something like this???<br />I requested my money back and I will wait until they re-issue the proper recording!<br /><br />P.S. I can see now ([...] that this is an issue already reported in Europe (earlier release date). People complain about audio and video. It looks like the DVD version is correct, even the picture quality surpasses the blu-ray, which only points out that there is a problem with blu-ray pressing.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Stellar performances by a stellar cast,and a great script.<br /><br />Ledger's\\"Joker\\" is nuanced, mesmerizing and frightening-had to remind myself this was just a movie more than once.<br /><br />The darker, more realistic, approach taken by director Christopher Nolan was a refreshing change from the earlier more campy takes on the cape crusader.<br /><br />Loved it!
B00COGXX7A|3.0|Everyone told me I had to watch this movie, that it was so great.  But it was okay, not a 5 star movie.
B0014QABX0|5.0|They sure don't look like the music they make!  They sure don't look like musicians.  They certainly make great music. But, I can't listen to them while at my computer! My whole body starts moving to their music and my hands and fingers to strange things!

B00BCK1A5G|5.0|I've been a Nalini fan for a while now, and her writing just keeps getting better and better.<br />In my opinion, she hasn't settled into that 'formula' that a lot of writers fall into - I'm talking about how some authors use the same phrases in all off their books, and never think to change it up a little. My pet peeve (to give you an example) is in Christine Feehan's Dark series, where in almost EVERY book, there is the phrases 'I can do no other than to ensure your happiness/safety'. It drives me CRAZY!<br />Anyway, Nalini doesn't do this, and I love her writing.<br />If you've never read Nalini before, I suggest you start at the beginning of the series. Things will make MUCH more sense if you do. Trust me.<br /><br />So about the book itself.<br />Heart of Obsidian is probably one of the most anticipated books in the series, so far.<br />She didn't disappoint, either. I LOVE this book. I re-read it often, usually once a month, or so, and it never gets old.<br />I love how she's written Kaleb's  growth into being the man that he needs to be.<br />I don't want to say too much else, because I don't want to let any spoilers out, but it's well worth the read. I think it has the right amount of grit too it. I personally, find it hard reading detailed stuff about the bad sh*t that happens to people, so for me Nalini managed to strike the right balance of giving you enough detail, in short snippets to let you know that things were bad, but you don't have to endure hours of mental images being inflicted on your brain.<br />I have this on my Kindle, and one day soon, I'll be getting the paperback as well. (just to show you how MUCH I love this book, I only buy hardcopies of the books that I absolutely love and want to re-read, as I have very little space at my house, so I can't buy every single book I've ever read)
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|One of my personal favorites- I was intrigued for hours.  I loved the graphics- the story line- every bit of it!
B002361MLA|5.0|I will not write much. Everything has been said already.<br /><br />This is the number one book I have read to take you out of depression.<br /><br />As with everything you need to practice.<br /><br />And don't try to understand. Just watch and let go of the second hand information. You will only use it by choice. It is not who you are.<br /><br />Best wishes !
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I play just about every day for a little while. It's fun and helps me unwind after a busy work day.
B00001QEFU|5.0|This was twisted sister first cd they put out. And i enjoyed every song and the cd. there good cd. If you are a t s fan like me you'll  want to have this in your collection!
B00EQRMLNM|5.0|This song is beautifully written. I know this will be a classic in the years to come. Great lovely song.
B009GX69RK|5.0|love this show! so hilarious!!!! definately worth the money.. the characters are all so hilarious and the actors are perfect in their roles.
0425252868|5.0|Fascinating account from both sides of the war, from the perspective of a pair of fighter pilots.  Though war is inhumane, here's an example of humanity overcoming directives.  I've recommended it to six others who also loved it.
B004J64QSI|4.0|I love the music from Les Mis.  I can listen to it every day. I recommend this DVD to anyone
B008ODZEQ0|4.0|An ethos of commitment to career and vocation and dedication to maintaining the highest standards is set in modern-day Tokyo.  If pictures of the Tsukiji fish market, sushi and a desire for perfection are of interest, this flick is for you.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It works instantly and great. Underlining is easy and highlighting in different colors is fun. Get studying with this app
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is so awesome me and my bff play it togerther because both of us have a kindle fire.
074322454X|5.0|Loved reading about these heroes of World War II.  Even after viewing the HBO series Easy's narrative fascinates, should be on every high schooler's must read list!
B00ECU2SGS|3.0|Would like to get my money back.  Movie made us feel sad that there are people that live like that.  I know that some of that is reality.  Did not feel entertained but disappointed.  However, on the plus side, the acting was great.  English was hard to understand - redneck intense.  Missed a lot.  I would not recommend this movie for entertainment unless you enjoy feeling down.
B00CD36FF6|3.0|The book was not well-written and somewhat of a disappointment. I  have started it a month ago and couldn't see myself finishing it. Yes..people lie with motivation and with intention but...what can we do about it? no solution is given. It's just a series of experiments. Disappointing.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|At first I thought this would be a good &#34;women's lit&#34; read.  Then, three chapters in, I realized this was rich with interesting characters woven together in ways that surprised me.<br /><br />I will read more of Ms. Moriarty's work based on this first read.
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|If your a fan of Underworld films and you like vampires and werewolves, She back, Kate Beckinsale in \\"Underworld: Awakening\\". Action never stops. It's great story telling on film. I just think it great film to watch and watch again. 5 star winner again for Kate. Great looking film in all departments. I also brought this film DVD in 3-D, which is outstanding to watch in 3-D.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Truly inspiring. As an American I want to give more to my country knowing that these brave men have given their all. May God bless these hero's and their families.
B00DH1G7DS|5.0|I am just starting to do Sudoku puzzles and this app has worked well for me. The easy level is challenging enough to be interesting without being so hard that I give up. I know that I will continue to increase the diffuculty level as time goes on. It is nice that the game has a variety of difficulty levels so you can move up as you get better.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really well done.  Thought the casting was fantastic was was the acting, even though I wasn't sure that I would like it.
B00DCX08MW|5.0|I love it. It is a nice game you can only get three planes though but the good thing is there is about 40 levels
B000SEGMAU|4.0|Yet, another great read from Mitch Albom. Tuesdays with Morrie, makes you think and realize what is most important in life. Makes me call my family, that much more!
B007SGM084|5.0|I could not put it down, I wend from one book to the next, no breaks.<br /><br />Im hoping that E L James has another book to come out soon.
B00003W8NM|5.0|Great extras and a really great movie overall. I recommend it to everyone who loves a great movie with plot twists.
B00947N6D8|5.0|This is a well written story.  The characters are unique and funny.  It has a good story line.  Very touching will a happy ending, of course.
B0015346OM|5.0|This book is amazing so much better then the movie.<br />If you like the movie then you better read this book.<br />Very intense and keeps you locked on the story.<br />Recommend for anyone.
B003VW54QO|5.0|A good movia to see rio  bravo if you like John Wayne movies!! and with Den Martin and with Reky Nelson
1609611543|4.0|This is a great book! it changed my life! I learned sooo many things & have a different view of food!

0449000729|5.0|Best book I've ever read in my life.  Highly informative,  have actually read twice, and bought as a gift for someone
B000YMQI6E|4.0|Anthony Hopkins, my favorite actor, did not disappoint.  Ryan Gosling was very believable going from very high, to very low.  All along a nice winding thriller that has you booing and smiling throughout.
B00A0SICYI|5.0|I love this movie! I grew up singing these songs and &#34;trying&#34; to dance the dances! It's a fun movie!
B0033RT7RY|4.0|I personally believe in Stigmata,  The movie does a good job of explaining the why this gift might be given,  I also like that it's often the least likely people chosen...and it illustrates proufoundly the battle between God and Satan.  The acing is fair, the production ok, I liked it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|still trying to figure it all out but it's keeping my interest !!!!! not understanding how the collections work yet but I am sure I will get it soon.
B0087ZG7J8|5.0|the movie was a gift for my daughters boyfriend. he loves jurassic park and has been looking for a while for this movie and had no luck finding it. and as i have found out from previous experiences amazon.com is the first place to look. i have not seen the movte so i can't write a review on it. but i can say he was very pleased with it and it arrived earlier than scheduled. thankyou
B005OMOKN2|4.0|I usually go with whatever is cheapest, but these days quality control is dropping pretty fast.  So I decided to go with the Nikon Brand for my Nikon camera, and it works great.
B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Just tried to request a refund for this since I always enjoy watching all the bonus features. Got a message that they will only issue replacements for damaged/defective copies as this is not eligible for refunds! TOTALLY SUCKS! Thank goodness the price was drastically reduced. Guess I'll save this as a stocking stuffer for Christmas.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I was eventually able to navigate the \\"contact customer support\\" function and promptly received an e-mail response offering my choice of a $6 account credit or return for full refund. While I appreciate the options, the additional hassle involved was very frustrating.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|The instructions are straightforward and easy to follow.  This was exactly what I needed - the basics without a bunch of overburden.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|makes you concentrate and think I like the different combinations of games you can play very interesting combinations I like
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Loved the book, I was one of those people who thought there was no way I could enjoy this &#34;kind&#34; of book. I was wrong I couldn't read it fast enough and of course at the end had to know what happened next!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book has blown my mind!! Always curious about the afterlife and near-death experiences, I've read several first-hand account books on the subject. In the ones I've previously read, it seemed they were predisposed to what they experienced near-death by their deeply religious experiences prior to their NDE. But this author, a casual Christian at most, and a neurosurgeon has me convinced. It also has me convinced that there are many paths to God.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Ok, first of all whoever rates this app less than four stars need mental help.<br />Second of all GREAT APP Mojang is probably one of the best companies out there<br />because they actually said that they dont and most likely never advertise!<br />They leave it up to us to spread the word of the game to others.<br />If anyone pirates this app first of all STOP because Minecraft is AMAZING!<br />Also Mojang is one of the ONLY corporations in the world that allows you to freely modify the game and do anything you want to do with it expect redistribute it (FYI if you mod BO2 you can get in BIG TROUBLE)<br />And so this review isnt CMPLETELY irrelevant THIS IS THE ANSWER TO WORLD<br /> PEACE!!!!!!!! AWESOME GAME!!!!!<br /><br />And someone please start #MCPEFTW
B009LHWEKW|5.0|I have watched all seven other seasons and this was one of the best. I really recommend this for supernatural fans the quality was great and the instant watch worked great as well.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Fantastic, magical and a little bit disturbing - the Ocean at the End of the Lane was a wonderful quick read. I will definitely read it again and I recommend to anyone who likes fantasy meets the real world sorts of stories.
B0025KVLU6|5.0|The Beatles are and will always be the top band in the  country. Even though 2 members have already passed away the other two are good singers too.
B005K01VZS|5.0|I loved this book, I like everything he writes. It is a fast read and like most of his books....causes one to think.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|I really love Alice In Chains Music anyway. This is a good Album and I am hoping they do some more Albums soon. Would love to see them in concert.
B000ZELISO|5.0|I chose this rating as it is exactly as described and well worth the money, I would recommend this to anyone that wanted one
0896762173|5.0|Helped me make some fancy gowns for balls. I enjoy sewing and this book helped! I would recommend this book to everyone.
B005S9EK5Y|4.0|A moving rendition of this time honored story.  The misery and desperation of all the main characters is palpable and I cry whenever I see it.  The music and songs are haunting.  The really sad part is that real life was like this depiction.  But, all the sadness aside, it's a good movie and I enjoy watching it.
B000093BDX|5.0|I got this CD for my niece for her birthday and she loved it. It has so many great songs on it.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|...but I don't care.  I love this movie!  It is joyous and fun and always lifts my spirits if I'm down.  Love this movie.
B0063M22QO|4.0|This is not the full-blown version available for a PC, but it does have a good selection of patterns. The number of tiles in a puzzle are not as many, but enough to still be a challenge.<br />The only feature missing is the ability to view landscape vs. portrait.
B0001AVZA8|5.0|Loved this movie when it first came out; bought the VHS tape (!!) and now this.  It's a got-to-have staple for any movie library.  Smiles all around.
B00B4Z5J92|5.0|Great movie about the makings of great music with a scary message about where the music industry is going... It's awesome
B00CHRBANK|4.0|I bought this album because of kangaroo court but it has far surpassed that. The whole album is good and I plan on listening to it for years.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It is a great story and wonderfully written.  The author presents many difficult aspects of life and loss from the wise and sympathetic view point of the family dog.  Humor included.  Victorious results.
B008KZX8C4|5.0|Great album well mastered and great tunes. Would buy over again in a heart beat, and it is on 180 gram.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I've been trying for a while to find this on DVD.. finally found it.. One of my favorite Johnny Depp movies :)
B005ZMUXDC|1.0|The original download failed and I was never able to reinitiate the download.  It kept asking me to re-purchase then telling me I had already bought it.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|Watch IT if you are into sci fi Crusie does his things of course but does not take away from good plot
B00499NHLC|4.0|A very enjoyable show.  A little awkward at times, but moves steadily.  I don't really understand the role of his brother.
B0027I93U6|4.0|I am glad i waited, could not imagine watching ant series like this waiting a week or more,i have waited for Weeds,this others get to watch as many episodes timelines make sense
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|I must admit some bias: I've been a diehard fan of Reznor's work for years, and will eat pretty much anything he has to offer. Hesitation Marks is no exception; although I have to confess I didn't really love it all that much at first. Like The Downward Spiral, Hesitation Marks is a dense album that requires multiple listens to truly uncover the intricacies of Reznor's latest offering.<br /><br />Another point: Yes, this album doesn't sound any different from his last project, How To Destroy Angels. The moods, sound textures, atmosphere; the only thing that's missing is Maandigs vocals. But that's hardly a bad thing; Reznor adds enough of that NIN \\"flair\\" to differentiate this album from HTDA's previous works.<br /><br />In closing, Hesitation Marks is another notch in the NIN staple that deserves positive recognition. If you didn't like How To Destroy Angels, this might not appeal to you, but for everyone else, this is like a giant cake; it goes down great.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This calculator is just what I want for my calculations. I have been using another one for quite a time, but when I decide to try this one, it met my expectations.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What can you really say about facebook. It is what it is a social network that everyone is on to stay in touch.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|I like this DVD. I bought this a few weeks ago and I don't regret. It's amazing, Anna Paquin does great job. I love this tv show.
B004UID2LC|4.0|For the first couple of days it worked now it doesn't work I was looking at the videos today and it was saying can not play video every time I would try to watch a video but you should try it but it does have problems I hope they can remove all the problems but for some people it works
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game allows to let you feed clean groom play and take pics of your horse. It is real simple and fun. The graphics are great and there is no lag.
B007MC8YLQ|2.0|not an addicting app for me,no excitement,no zing. aptly named, will never go to jail for playing it,easier to bail out
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I love this show. It is hilarious and entertaining. If you haven't watched it, you will not be disappointed when you do.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|love,love the variety of play levels,fun to play against myself an compete if i choose to.<br />would reccommend installation to everyone
0143122010|1.0|I was waiting not so patiently for this book to come in - and I was very happy when it arrived.<br />As I progressed through the book I was increasingly disappointed and to be fair to the author I did not read past the frist two chapters.  Over and over in the reading that I did complete the author was assuming/estimating how I would respond to his work/premise. There were places that he made statements I found doubious about the lack of contradictory evidence.  I would put down the book for a few days and pick it up again thinking that maybe I just have not given it a chance - and shortly after put it down again.  I was going to give it to the local library and decided against that, I tried to think of someone who would like the book - no one came to mind.  I threw the book in the trash - not kidding - first time ever.  I wasted my money and my time.
B0091WNK8M|4.0|The quality and movie streaming for The Goonies was great!  I would recommend this movie to anyone and my son enjoyed watching it with me.  There were a few adult words.
B004I744AS|5.0|would be better if the application usable without a network connection that the meeting was very well great job. so I prefer to keep out the application Connect but usable outside give 5 star excellent
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I read this book for my literature class and enjoyed every moment of it, I highly suggest this book for all
B0051UH6YM|5.0|This book is informative, entertaining and humorous. If you are at all interested in improving your written language, punctuation and grammar, this is the book for you.
B005WUHAX8|5.0|Bought it for my Grand daughter.  She is around sprint cars every weekend. so it keeps the dust and mud out of her phone.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really great and fun game. It has really helped me to get a small understanding of what it is gonna take to get a horse. 5 stars!
B00B9366VO|5.0|Great history of an iconic staple of some of the best music and musicians ever. This is a must watch for all music lovers!

B00EYN3HTA|5.0|This a great collection of poetry. I really enjoyed all of the poems. I do not read poetry all that much, but when I do I like to turn to this author for my enjoyment. He just has a way with words that speaks to my soul and gives me great enjoyment. I recommend this to pretty much everyone. The author has a way of writing to where everyone would enjoy the words. Very talented writer. I really enjoyed this book.
B006M9NJFG|1.0|If I had chance to see product before purchasing online I will never buy it.<br />- Very poor build quality. Especially sheath and aluminum cup have some defects on them.<br />- Bottle it self is made of very cheap plastic. Inside of the bottle smells very bad which makes the water in it undrinkable<br />- And Although it says food grade aluminum cup I won't cook anything in the cup because of the paint on it.
B009EHDU7U|5.0|Forest gump from another country. An excellent light hearted read with coincidence following coincidence to a great conclusion. If you live to be a hundred then this is worth thinking about
B00957T6X6|5.0|The books are well written.  They differ from the show, so you can have the best of both worlds.  Good job!
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Harold Fry is the Ulysses/Jason of our times. He sets out on his hero's journey and brings back something better than the golden fleece--understanding, love and a new life. Despite the seemingly sadness of his pilgrimage, this is an uplifting story about taking life step by step.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|It is good if you can tolarate the slow and dropping connection. All you can do is watch only YouTube and NetFlix on your tv from your smart phone. You can not stream any other thing from your computer/latptop/phone. It could have been a great product. Google just spoilt it. My suggestion - just try to find other similar product which can do more than just streaming youtube and netflilx.
B00821OX98|4.0|3rd season is breakout season. Story became darker and more interesting. Can't wait till the new fourth season. Too bad it's a long time away.
B005QYKD4I|2.0|Still not very impressed w/ the Transformers movies, although I am a massive fan of the Cartoon<br /><br />- Action scenes are too convoluted and close-up to truly appreciate the size of the Robots<br />- The complexity of the Robots' body structure is again far too convoluted.<br />  They look more like heaps of electrical garbage than sophisticated machines<br />- Also, the correlation of the Robot form to the Vehicular form it masks, is just not believable/convincing.<br />  e.g. Optimus Prime appears to be at least 2-3 times as tall and body-dense as the Cab of any Semi should/could be.<br />- Acting is absolutely terrible<br />- Scripts are pretty much Rubbish!<br /><br />I think it all went wrong when the writers/producers/directors decided to make these movies from a Human's perspective!<br />The ridiculously mushy storylines surrounding the Autobots and Decepticons just does not fit with the overall motif.<br /><br />They should try a storyline that involves little to no Humans at all (i.e. Robots to Robots) more in line w/ the Cartoon series and shoot it as such - from the perspective of Robots and not Humans.<br /><br />I suggest they go back to the roots of the Robots/Story/Cartoon and work their way forward all over again!<br /><br />EM
B009UMTMKS|1.0|The kindle version of this is NOT the same as The Startup Owner's Manual! Instead you get the Startup Owner's Strategy Guide, which is a very condensed version. I bought this for a class and was super frustrated to find that it wasn't the same as the original hardcover book. I am going to try to get a refund because it's not what was advertised to me. Ugh.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|As a professional women in a predominately male field. I am encouraged by this conversation.  I no longer have the same issues as children since my son is married and has one child and another on the way. My daughter in law, has chosen to be a stay at home mom and I support her decision. I myself, have felt many of the obstacles and emotions defined here and yes we still do have a long way to go! Just the other day a man I hired to work under me, whom I've known and been good friends with for years commented to another male employee that I was too\\"cocky\\"! If I was a man that comment would never have been made! I recommended this book to everyone! Enlightening, uplifting and certainly needed in today's society to keep the conversation going!
B003CH9PTU|4.0|I like the series even though it wasn't what I expected. I thought the main character of the high school chemistry teacher turned meth lord was going to be harder, but so far I'm starting the third season and he's still not what you would think a drug lord would be. That may be what keeps me watching but I must admit I'm waiting for the tough guy to show up and not the chemistry teacher turned jerk off.  Overall, it's a good storyline, but I sadly like the drug addict more than the dying high school teacher unable to pay his medical treatment, which is not how I expected to feel when I started watching the show. After finishing the second season last night, I don't even like his wife any longer. I feel somewhat guilty watching a show where I like the criminal characters more than the &#34;good guy&#34;, but I'm still watching so that must mean it's a good show.
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Really is fast moving and keeps you on track. I really like the characters and it can be so true to life.
B000002GYW|4.0|I'm not sure why so many rock bands feel that they absolutely must write a song that equates being in a band to being western outlaws. But from Bon Jovi to Thin Lizzy, they all need to write a cowboy song. So you really have to hand it to Eagles. They skipped the single song part and went for a concept album, \\"Desperado.\\" On their second full length album, yet. This also marked the beginning of Don Henley's ascent to the front of the band. On \\"Eagles,\\" the band kind of democratically split the singing and songwriting. For \\"Desperado,\\" Don Henley took writing or co-writing credit on 8 of 11 songs.<br /><br />The singing was still split among the members (with Leadon getting on of the better album tracks, \\"Bitter Creek\\"). However, the partnership between Henley and Glenn Frey was starting to bear serious fruit, with the two most memorable songs being their co-compositions, \\"Desperado\\" and the album's hit, \\"Tequila Sunrise.\\" Oddly enough, it was Linda Ronstadt's version of the title song that originally got to be well known, although Eagles' now can probably claim that prize. The overall western theme is tied in the title song and another one of the band's work with Jackson Brown, \\"Doolin' Dalton,\\" which appears in three forms on \\"Desperado.\\" It leads the album off, then Leadon banjo picks a reprise just before \\"Outlaw Man,\\" and then a medley reprise with the title track to bring the album to a satisfying close. Also, the harmonies remained one of the band's biggest draws, with songs like \\"What Ever Happened to Saturday Night\\" and \\"Tequila Sunrise.\\"<br /><br />What was still holding Eagles back was they had yet to show they could convincingly rock. To their credit they've repeatedly blamed producer Glynn Johns for that, but one listen to \\"Out Of Control\\" also points out that they still didn't have the material that was up to the task. That hardly matters, as \\"Desperado\\" was an early peak for Eagles, and their albums would keep getting stronger. By the time they'd next explore the concept album, they'd be more than ready.explore the concept album, they'd be more than ready.
B00AAQHP66|5.0|This was our favorite movie of the year. The whole family enjoyed it and will watch it again. Great story line and beautiful backdrop in California.
0061906220|5.0|This is one of my favorite books to give for gifts - the colors are bright, the story is cute, the simplicity is very easy to follow for many different ages.  Love it!
B00AA0U05A|5.0|Living in an Era where commercial stuff is our everyday product, having found this jewel was really surprising!!<br />I only knew that Emmy Rossum sings when I saw her at the movie &#34;The Phantom of the Opera&#34;, but out of it I had no idea she continued her career in music...but REAL MUSIC!!<br /><br />I hear a couple of songs on youtube and finally decided to buy this album...OMG!! WHAT A WONDERFUL SURPRISE! This IS music..Her voice, the music, every song in the album has its reason to be there...The booklet inside has several pictures in a very artistic blacn and white style (no lyrics of the songs printed)<br /><br />I recommend this album to those who like classic songs, lyrics with meaning, the golden age of movies (although it's not an album of movie songs, but the concept take me to 1940 or 1950)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Very easy to use, and love the large numbers that make it easy to see without my glasses. Also, can't beat the free price tag.
B00CS74W0C|5.0|The fact that read all there books in a week say alot about how addicting these books are. I sensed a similarity to Fifty Shades but still a series in it's own right. I can't wait to read the next two bboks in the series.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|I'd never been drawn to this series on TV but found myself with some time and no television and so turned to my prime account to provide some entertainment.  I found the series interesting and compelling with the occasional addressing of issues and quite excellent acting, especially from Julianna Margulies (who is incredibly subtle and skilled) and Archie Panjabi, who plays the fascinating Kalinda beautifully, as a foil to Margulies's almost too perfect Alicia.  It's not profound: won't provoke much talk around the table, but for network fare it's better than average and the characters are quite addictive, especially the female characters, who seem to have more dimension than do the males. There's enough suspense to balance the soap and enough soap to keep a protracted storyline going behind the episode-long courtroom dramas.  Would recommend as solid entertainment.
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I am a fan of Star Trek starting way back with the original released series...I have enjoyed them all. This second film in the current series captures all of the elements of the original team and amplifies it to the point of perfection. Each character remains true to the original in their own unique performances. Chris Pine has the ability to communicate extremely strong emotional intensity. The new, younger Spock has an obvious grasp of who he is ( or is becoming). The humor and character interplay is quick, sharp and constantly building. Keep this thing going for many years to come....You got it right!!
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Awesome as usual remaster makes this series even better. Thanks amazon for bringing back a classic from the 60's thank you!
B004JMY312|5.0|Love this movie it is simply not the Halloween season with out it! I rented it so my nephew and daughter could see it for the first time and they loved it as well!
B006BFK5DK|5.0|I did not think they could pull it off after all these years, but this CD from Sign on to the end is great. Classic EWF. I am disappointed by the media such as USA today and MSN, who did not even list this as one of the CDs being released this fall. What a slap in the face to this Legendary Group. I guess you have to be Rock and Roll such as the Rolling Stones to get any pub. However, we as fans know how great EWF is now, then, and forever!!!!
B00DSTBMMU|4.0|I've always felt that Sheryl Crow deserves a lot more credit for the career she's forged for herself than she tends to receive. It sometimes feels to me, when reading critiques of her albums, that it's a sin to make steady, reliable, sturdy music--music that might not push the envelope of \\"creativity\\" and \\"art\\" (whatever those terms really mean), but that is consistently well-crafted, enjoyable, and solid, and frequently exceptional (IMO). Does she smash a ton of boundaries in her music? No, but that's not the point. That's not what she's ever been about. She makes frequently fantastic pop/rock music. She's a tunesmith of the highest order, and what's wrong with that? Not to draw a direct comparison, of course, but look at ABBA. They were frequently panned for making lightweight fluff that, while incredibly catchy, didn't have much to offer beyond great melodies. Now they're widely regarded as one of the finest pop groups to have ever walked the planet. Sometimes it's not such a bad thing to be good at writing a short, catchy, indelible pop song.<br /><br />And Sheryl Crow continues to make very, very good pop albums. \\"Feels Like Home\\" may or may not be a conscious attempt to cross over to a country audience. If it is, it doesn't seem like a particularly blatant attempt to me. Her music has always had a country/roots edge to it, anyway. Regardless, I consider it an excellent album. There isn't much filler to these ears, but the clear highlights for me (at least at first listen) are \\"Crazy Ain't Original\\" and \\"Nobody's Business.\\"<br /><br />To me, solid is as solid does, and \\"Feels Like Home\\" is yet another strong, solid effort by, IMO, one of the more reliably great pop/rock artists we have going right now. Will it change lives or alter the musical landscape like [insert all-time iconic album of your choice here]? Likely not, but so friggin' what? If it makes you smile and gets your toes tappin', I see no problem with that whatsoever. And Ms. Crow is able to do thatseemingly at will. And that is a pretty awesome talent to have.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I have read this book multiple times, and each time I feel such a strong everlasting connection to the characters.  It is such a marvelous story, filled with love, happiness, humor, sadness, and anger.  I laughed out loud, cried good and bad tears, wanted to throw my kindle, and at the same time hug it!  For me, the bond between Abby and Travis is one people strive to feel, if only for once in their life.  I was drawn into this book from chapter one and could not put it down; when the book finished I found myself still thinking of Travis and Abby.<br /><br />Abby is captivating from the moment she enters the book.  One chance encounter with the universities man whore finds Abby on the verge of a life-changing event and she doesn't even know it.<br /><br />Enter Travis `Mad Dog' Maddox all 6 feet plus of him.  Lean and ripped with muscles most girls only see in their dreams, buzzed off brown hair, and dangerous tattoos that spread down his glorious body.  Oh yes, did I mention he drives a motorcycle too?  He is a Godsend and he knows it.  Travis is the `use them and lose them' type.  He isn't looking for love nor does he want to find it, but when this pint sized girl with caramel colored hair, a ridiculous pink cardigan, and wide grey eyes steps foot into his life, he is never the same again.<br /><br />Abby is running from her past and is hell bent on staying on the track she thinks will get her to where she wants to go.  Abby shuts down any type of feelings she may have for Travis, before she is able to get dragged down the rabbit hole she is trying to avoid.  One accidental mishap with the boilers at Abby's dorm and Abby ends up staying at Travis and Shepley's apartment. When the boilers eventually get fixed, Abby finds herself making a bet with Travis that puts Abby at his apartment for another month.<br /><br />During her stay at the apartment, Abby battles what she thinks she wants versus what she really needs for herself.  These two fight many obstacles that have the ability to damage what they are both feeling yet neither one of them own up to.  When things finally start looking up and Abby gets her head out of her ass, a blast from the past comes rushing into her life.  This person could just have the power to annihilate everything they have worked so hard to overcome.  Can these two beat the odds and work together to become a beautiful disaster?
B00A285OOW|5.0|She really knows how to bring history to life. All of her books, and new line of fiction, are worth every minute to read. She can put your mind right in there living it with her characters.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|Love this movie!  It's hilarious and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time!  I would highly recommend it to anyone.

B00E978FGQ|5.0|This movie had my whole family on the edge of their seats. Very good. It keeps you guessing all the way to the end.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I'm a big 'ol Hunger Games nerd.  I was able to read the books before I even knew the movie was in production.  Once I found out, I was a little sad, because I just knew the producers would massacre the book.  Surprisingly, the did a good job.  Yes, there were some changes, but overall, they captured this book really well.  I've since watched this movie at least 8-9 times, and I still notice new things.  LOVE
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I got this product thinking there was probably a catch but no you can enjoy game for free if have patience. I am having lots of fun and would recommend highly.
B000R8YC1I|5.0|What can I say?  It's a classic at our house.  I loved it as a kid, and I can still appreciate it as an adult.  My four year old loves it.  We haven't really watched the extras, so I can't speak for that, but I'm not really interested in the hours of costumes and creature creation.  If you are, it seems this would be the edition for you.
B007KDFWRG|5.0|From the deep-deep-down female-vocals, to the \\"expected\\" grittiness sounds that simply don't exist because it's smooth, on-key, new, yet some classic sounds all the way to you just \\"wantin' more!!\\"-----you have it all goin' on here. It's no wonder they named this album as they did because you're gonna want to be tellin' everyone about it cuz it's just that GOOD!!
B00DNDR29I|4.0|I just got it today, I had been waiting a long time for this one.  The Electric Lady doesn't come out and totally blow your mind like The ArchAndroid did, but it's a great disc with a number of wonderful tracks on it. She covered more styles of music last time around,  and this one has several more mid tempo tracks on it.  At any rate, both suites are killer, as is Givin Em What They Love, QUEEN, Dance Apocalyptic, We Were Rock and Roll, and Dorothy Dandridge Eyes.  Highly recommended, but the ArchAndroid is still the R+B disc of the last decade.  Buy them both, Janelle rules!
B001NIA27E|4.0|Good movie lots of action a few parts are a little hard to believe but over all a good movie

B008EL25LE|3.0|Would loved to have seen something in it besides timed matching puzzle grids in the game content with this one.
B000Z27HLS|4.0|Enjoy Jane Austen? This is another good making of this classic story. The movie appeals to romantic types as well as those that that like some suspense. Masterpiece Theatre: Northanger Abbey is a good piece to add to your Jane Austen movie collection.

B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This is the best Sci-Fi flick I've seen in recent memory. Great plot, action, theme music, etc. Its the type of movie you think about the next day and want to talk about with your friends. I'd tell you more, but I don't want to spoil it.

B00DJWV11I|5.0|Ever finished watching your favorite movie and think, &#34;Lets do that again!&#34; Yeah that's definitely this book. Its funny, sweet, charming, witty, frustrating, relatable, and makes you think. Plus the main female isn't some ditz and the main man is a hunk! It's a great love story from a mans point of you.

B00068TJM6|5.0|I've had so many people asking me what type of watch was it, and others asked me how much did I pay for it. I have over 17 watches, this by far the cheapest and the one I use daily!!

140006922X|5.0|Professor Dr. Reza Aslan has given us a superb \\"plausible\\" re-enactment of the historical intentions of Jesus [Jeshu'a, Aramaic; Joshu'a, Hebrew] and the Nasorean nascent Christian church.  He has correctly identified the accurate meaning of the title, \\"Son of Man\\", as used by Jesus and his fellow associates or, later, \\"apostles\\" [Greek < Aramaic < Hebrew \\"one who has been sent\\"].  Furthermore, he accurately describes the Roman administration of Nero, Vaspasian and Titus, and the craven role of the highly successful, brutal Pontius Pilate.  His academic philological details are right-on; obviously he has been advised by first-rate ancient language scholars.<br /><br />I am in a position to know of these matters; I am competently trained in Latin, Greek, Hebrew and Aramaic.  I am an ancient language scholar.  Dr. Aslan lives up to the high standards of the Persian race: Truthfulness & Moral Purity! [These are the twin values of the Persian-Iranian people; study their Avesta Literature.]  His book should contribute to the multi-dimensional inter-confessional dialogue between the Five Peoples of the Book:  Magian [Old & Middle Persian], Jewish, Sabaean, Christian & Moslem!<br /><br />His delightful, well-written, literary book deserves a wide audience.  It has a great deal to teach the casually ill-informed, as well as the informed.<br /><br />John E.D.P. Malin<br />Lafayette, Louisiana

B00EMJD6TC|4.0|I am a big fan of Max Brooks book World War Z.  It has a great assortment of characters in entertaining scenarios.  It is well written, greatly paced and a fun read.  Now we have the movie.  The only thing in common with the book is the title, and you know what?  I'm good with that.  It was great to see a zombie film unfold on a global scale and to see an intelligent main character.  Brad Pitt is fantastic taking on this journey across the world to save humanity, maybe one of his best films to date.  The zombies are amped up to the extreme which make them more threatening than ever and the action set pieces are excellent.  Forget the book when you watch this, put it out of your mind.  The book will still be there when the movie ends.  Sit back, relax and enjoy a great film.  If you want a zombie movie to complain about there are plenty on Netflix.
B003JH8LPW|4.0|I enjoy the details Mr Brown uses in his works, it gives an &#34;inside&#34; view. Also the fast pace of the book.

1250030951|5.0|The minute that I finished reading Rainbow Rowell's Eleanor & Park I KNEW that I was going to be reading more from this author. That book was so awesome: set in the 1980's, featuring a KILLER 80's soundtrack, and a super swoony romance between two outcasts--what's not to love?? I think it was actually the author who let me know about her next planned work, Fangirl. I had asked if music would play a big role in that book too (it's clear that Rowell is a music lover, just look at her website)  and she said strangely enough, no. But what Fangirl might lack in music themes it makes up for in WRITING themes. And what I mean by that is if you are a book lover, if you are a fanfiction lover, if you are a writer, or even a wannabe writer, Fangirl  is for YOU. There is so much about writing packed into this book, the process itself--the frustration and joys--it's really motivational in my opinion. It makes YOU want to write, to create. And makes you appreciate anyone who chooses to do so even more.<br /><br />Let's meet our protagonist Cath (or Cather as I will always think of her.) Here's the thing: if you read about Cather in the above synopsis you can get a pretty good idea of who she is. Socially awkward, introverted, much more comfortable escaping into the pages of her fanfiction (which bears remarkable similarities to a famous series about a British boy wizard.) Well, anyone other then her twin sister Wren and her dad, Art.<br /><br />Cather is stunned and hurt when her twin, best friend, and confidant Wren tells her she doesn't want to room with her at college. No one understands her like Wren, it was just the two of them when their mom ditched the family when the girls were only eight years old. And like Cather, Wren was a huge fan of Simon Snow, the successful and famous book series that has been the center of Cather's world growing up. Wren and Cather made up the team of Magicath and Wrenegade, who became successes in their own right in the world of fandom. Well, they were  a successful duo until Wren  decided to stop and moved on.<br /><br />One the hardest things to witness in Fangirl was Wren snubbing Cather. But Cather is determined to make a go of college. And she does try. But for an introvert like Cather it's very hard. It doesn't really help that she has an older roommate who is the polar opposite of her in every way or that said roommate's boyfriend is always around. Cather hopes that the saving grace will be her fiction writing class, a class normally reserved for upper class men but one that she has received special permission to take. Cather is so excited about the instructor, Mrs. Piper, and the first encounter with her shows us why--she's one of those awesome professor's that students adore. She'd get the highest rating on Rate My Professor. And there is a cute boy in her class that seems to be showing some interest in Cather to boot.<br /><br />But there are things that are weighing her down. One is her dad. Cather's father raised the twins after their mom left. Like Cather he's got a creative side, he's an advertising executive. But he also suffers from manic depression. Cather is constantly worried about him and how he is adjusting to life in an empty house minus his two girls.<br /><br />And Cather is the midst of writing her opus, Carry On, Simon, the final installment in her fanfiction that she hopes to finish on or around the time that the real life author of the Simon Snow books wraps up her own series.<br /><br />A lot of the reviews I have read about this book seem to have something in common. Many, many readers really relate to Cather. Her awkwardness. Her introverted personality. The fact that she's more at ease writing in her dorm room than partying down at Fraternity Row. Most of the reviews I have read are by readers who have had similar experiences in high school and college.<br /><br />But here is the cool thing, I didn't have a similar experience. I'm not the most extroverted of people, but I am far from an introvert. Ou of high school, I went to a smaller junior college  in my own hometown, so I didn't do dorms or roommates. And while I enjoyed my courses, I did my share of partying. I lived in my own town and most of my friends stayed and attended college there too, so things didn't change much in that regard. My point is, I'm NOT like Cather, then or now, but I still TOTALLY get her as a character. I can still empathize because, hey, who hasn't had that moment of anxiety when entering a classroom for the first time and not knowing a soul? Who hasn't looked around a school cafeteria nervously wondering how to navigate the food lines and finding a place to sit? I think most of us have had some sort of experience like that. Now granted, Cather's anxiety and awkwardness is pretty extreme, but I don't think you have to be a Cather to love reading about a Cather. I may not relate on the most personal level--but I still felt a connection to her, I still worried about her, still cringed when things started going wrong, my heart still ached for her when she was hurt. That right there means that Rainbow Rowell did her job as a writer.<br /><br />I loved Cather but you know who else I loved in Fangirl? EVERYONE. Seriously, I can't think of one single character, even the douchey ones, that I didn't connect with as a reader. I'm big on fantastic secondary characters and let me tell you that this book has them in spades. Reagan, Cather's roommate was HILARIOUS. I love her so much. At first glance she's a snarky, abrasive bitch who can be harsh, cynical and jaded about, well, everything. But by book's end she earned her place as one of the best secondaries I have read this year. And she is funny as s***. Reagan and Wren both made me laugh so much.<br /><br />And Levi-- well Levi is an interesting one. I thought I had him all figured out early on in the book, but then he surprised me in so many ways. Levi is like the sun, perpetually happy go lucky, open, and just an honest, straightforward guy. I think it is IMPOSSIBLE not to like him. He's definitely a good guy--but Levi has depth to him, and flaws of his own.<br /><br />As soon as the door closed, Levi popped his eyes again. Bluely. \\"That's your twin sister?\\"<br />\\"Identical,\\" Reagan said, like she had a mouth full of hair.<br />Cath nodded and sat down at her desk.<br />\\"Wow.\\" Levi scooted down the bed so he was sitting across from her.<br />\\"I'm not sure what you're getting at,\\"  Cath said, \\"but I think it's offensive.\\"<br />\\"How can the fact that your identical twin sister is super hot be offensive to you?\\"<br />\\"Because,\\" Cath said, still too encouraged by Wren and, weirdly, by Abel, and maybe even by Nick, to let this get to her right now. \\"It me feel like the Ugly One.\\"<br />\\"You're not the ugly one.\\" Levi grinned. \\"You're just the Clark Kent.\\"<br />Cath started checking her email.<br />\\"Hey, Cath,\\" Levi said, kicking her chair. She could hear the teasing in his voice. \\"Will you warn me when you take off your glasses?\\"<br /><br />Nick is a mysterious character. He and Cather have a lot of common interests, and it's not too long before they start partnering up in class and writing together. Cather enjoys this because a) Nick's hot and b) Nick kind of helps ease the loss of Wren--who was her first writing partner.<br /><br />Cath kept working on the scene; a whole new conversation took shape in the margin. When he looked up, Nick was still smiling at her.<br />\\"What?\\" she asked.<br />\\"Nothing,\\" he said, laughing.<br />\\"What?\\"<br />\\"Nothing. Just...It's crazy that this works. Between you and me. That we can actually write together. It's like...thinking together.\\"<br />\\"It's nice,\\" Cath said, meaning it. \\"writing is lonely.\\"<br />\\"You wouldn't think we'd be on the same wavelength, you know? We're so different.\\"<br />\\"We're not that different.\\"<br />\\"Totally different,\\" he said. \\"Look at us.\\"<br />\\"We're both English majors, \\" Cath said. \\"We're both white. We live in Nebraska. We listen to the same music, we watch the same TV shows, we even have the same pair of Chuck Taylor's--\\"<br />\\"Yeah. But it's like John Lennon writing with...Taylor Swift instead of Paul McCartney.\\"<br />\\"Get over yourself,\\" Cath said. \\"you're not half as pretty as Taylor Swift.\\"<br />\\"You know what I mean.'\\" Nick poked her in the arm with the end of his pen.<br />\\"It's nice,\\" she said, looking up at him, still not sure if they were flirting--pretty sure she didn't want them to be. \\"Writing is lonely.\\"<br /><br />Wren and Art, Cather's sister and father, were also wonderful characters. It would be easy to write Wren off early in this book because of her really harsh behavior towards her twin--but like everyone else in this book, there is so much more to her then meets the eye. And Art--well I'm putting him in the same category as Vera Dietz's  father (Please Ignore Vera Dietz) and  Elise Dembowsky's dad (This Song Will Save Your Life.) In other words: PURE AWESOMENESS. Art's got his share of  problems, suffering from manic depression is no small thing, but he doesn't shirk his responsibilities as a parent when it counts. Thank you Rainbow Rowell for writing such wonderful parental figure.<br /><br />Can I talk about the romance? Guys, I am a BIG romance fan. BIG. And the romance in Fangirl was beautiful. Touching. REALISTIC. It was complicated at times, heartbreaking at others, and swoony for sure, but the best part about this romance? Totally unexpected and surprising--in the best way. Unconventional romantic lead and unconventional romance--but GAH, it is such a wonderful romance. It happens slowly so there is great tension, but the pacing also bears witness to how the two get to know each other over time.  Like all relationships, there are missteps, but on the flip side there is a building of trust, moments of  encouragement and a belief in one anther, so much that is just makes your heart SWELL.  I think it might just be one of my favorite bookish romances. That's saying something right there.<br /><br />I loved the college setting in this book too.  Because Cather and the rest are college students this book would qualify as New Adult. And it's the kind of New Adult that I adore. While romance plays a part in the story, the central focus is on Cather's coming of age, gaining independence, and finding herself--the romance is only one part of the book that highlights this overall theme.<br /><br />And while this book definitely has some issues and drama-- it never felt too weighty or over the top. It was a realistic portrayal of a girl, who for the first time ever is striking out on her own, without her built-in best friend and twin sister. It's an authentic look at what can happen to a family when one parent abandons them. It's a real look at dealing with all the fallout that can occur as a result of that abandonment.  Fallout that may not just be an overnight occurrence, but long lasting.  THESE are the kind of issue books I love to read. I love to see the characters in all their messy glory come to terms with life. Rainbow Rowell did a great job with this in Eleanor & Park--but I think that Fangirl does an even better job--it certainly struck a chord with me.<br /><br />I talked a little about the writing theme and how it's a continuous thread throughout Fangirl. I also wanted to note that this book is written in 3rd person POV, which is admittedly not my favorite. I have always preferred 1st person because it lets me connect with the narrator more. But guys, this book is written so well that it almost FELT like it was written in 1st person. It was so personal and emotional. I had no problem at all identifying and sympathizing with Cather or any of the other characters. I'm only pointing it out because it really surprised me.<br /><br />In addition, Fangirl employs a favorite tactic of mine, the story within the story. And here it is LITERALLY a story written within a story. Interspersed throughout Fangirl are excerptsfrom both Cather's fanfic Carry On, Simon and excerpts from the Simon Snow books themselves. I don't want to go over the entire plot with Cather's fanfiction, but I enjoyed it because it too was unexpected. And yes, there are definite correlations to Harry Potter and I would assume some of the Harry Potter fanfiction out there. But as the stars of Cather's fic Carry On--Simon and Bas, relay their story to readers, we definitely are able to see comparison's between their tale and  what is going on in Cather's life.<br /><br />Guys, I could seriously go on and on about this book, but I don't want to ruin any surprises that await you when you read because I think that the surprises, be it the unexpected behavior of a character or the turn of events that occur in Fangirl, THOSE are the best things about this book. It really resonated with me. It made me have all the emotions, all the feels. It is a special, special book. So, please get out there and read this book. Beg, borrow or steal if you have to (no, do NOT steal--just an expression.) Whatever--just read it. I know that I am a forever fan of Rainbow Rowell now--this book cemented it for me.<br /><br />Oh, and when you do, don't forget to check out the acknowledgements. I loved what Rainbow had to say about and to writers of fanfiction:)t instead of Paul McCartney.\\"  \\"Get over yourself,\\" Cath said. \\"you're not half as pretty as Taylor Swift.\\"  \\"You know what I mean.'\\" Nick poked her in the arm with the end of his pen.  \\"It's nice,\\" she said, looking up at him, still not sure if they were flirting--pretty sure she didn't want them to be. \\"Writing is lonely.\\"    Wren and Art, Cather's sister and father, were also wonderful characters.

Art's got his share of  problems, suffering from manic depression is no small thing, but he doesn't shirk his responsibilities as a parent when it counts. Thank you Rainbow Rowell for writing such wonderful parental figure.    Can I talk about the romance? Guys, I am a BIG romance fan. BIG. And the romance in Fangirl was beautiful. Touching. REALISTIC. It was complicated at times, heartbreaking at others, and swoony for sure, but the best part about this romance? Totally unexpected and surprising--in the best way. Unconventional romantic lead and unconventional romance--but GAH, it is such a wonderful romance. It happens slowly so there is great tension, but the pacing also bears witness to how the two get to know each other over time.  Like all relationships, there are missteps, but on the flip side there is a building of trust, moments of  encouragement and a belief in one anther, so much that is just makes your heart SWELL.  I think it might just be one of my favorite bookish romances. That's saying something right there.    I loved the college setting in this book too.  Because Cather and the rest are college students this book would qualify as New Adult. And it's the kind of New Adult that I adore. While romance plays a part in the story, the central focus is on Cather's coming of age, gaining independence, and finding herself--the romance is only one part of the book that highlights this overall theme.    And while this book definitely has some issues and drama-- it never felt too weighty or over the top. It was a realistic portrayal of a girl, who for the first time ever is striking out on her own, without her built-in best friend and twin sister. It's an authentic look at what can happen to a family when one parent abandons them. It's a real look at dealing with all the fallout that can occur as a result of that abandonment.  Fallout that may not just be an overnight occurrence, but long lasting.  THESE are the kind of issue books I love to read. I love to see the characters in all their messy glory come to terms with life. Rainbow Rowell did a great job with this in Eleanor & Park--but I think that Fangirl does an even better job--it certainly struck a chord with me.    I talked a little about the writing theme and how it's a continuous thread throughout Fangirl. I also wanted to note that this book is written in 3rd person POV, which is admittedly not my favorite. I have always preferred 1st person because it lets me connect with the narrator more. But guys, this book is written so well that it almost FELT like it was written in 1st person. It was so personal and emotional. I had no problem at all identifying and sympathizing with Cather or any of the other characters. I'm only pointing it out because it really surprised me.    In addition, Fangirl employs a favorite tactic of mine, the story within the story. And here it is LITERALLY a story written within a story. Interspersed throughout Fangirl are excerpts from both Cather's fanfic Carry On, Simon and excerpts from the Simon Snow books themselves. I don't want to go over the entire plot with Cather's fanfiction, but I enjoyed it because it too was unexpected. And yes, there are definite correlations to Harry Potter and I would assume some of the Harry Potter fanfiction out there. But as the stars of Cather's fic Carry On--Simon and Bas, relay their story to readers, we definitely are able to see comparison's between their tale and  what is going on in Cather's life.    Guys, I could seriously go on and on about this book, but I don't want to ruin any surprises that await you when you read because I think that the surprises, be it the unexpected behavior of a character or the turn of events that occur in Fangirl, THOSE are the best things about this book. It really resonated with me. It made me have all the emotions, all the feels. It is a special, special book. So, please get out there and read this book. Beg, borrow or steal if you have to (no, do NOT steal--just an expression.) Whatever--just read it. I know that I am a forever fan of Rainbow Rowell now--this book cemented it for me.    Oh, and when you do, don't forget to check out the acknowledgements. I loved what Rainbow had to say about and to writers of fanfiction:)
B00009W0WM|5.0|One of my all time favorites. Can watch it often and still get the feeling of a first time viewer.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is AMAZING! It was very entertaining and I just love it! I would recommend this game to everyone.
B00AREIAI8|2.0|Just another free game that's not worth the time it takes to play, unless you really can't live without your very own virtual rainbow unicorn, in which case you'll be spending the next month playing pointless minigames.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Nothing else to say than I loved it! 12 more required words to finish out my review. For Stupid... TY
B004LLDN3A|5.0|It brings you back to childhood! I really enjoyed seeing and hearing Julie Andrews. She is heavenly! And Dick Van Dyke... Awesome!
B000GCFY0I|4.0|I'm over 50 and read this book with my high school freshman.  It was a fast moving story, not terribly deep, but enough to keep up interest.  I would call it light sci-fi / friend adventure.  Worth a look.
B00D6BN9NK|1.0|Neither the story, the actors play or the filming is good. I am surprised it ever made it to the screen.
B005HED08I|5.0|A great deal of effort has gone into updating the special effects in this classic 1960's series, and if that increases sales then so much the better.  However it is the stories that have made this series endure and that is why I watch.  Today, on television, the episodes are so edited it is like listening to a skipping record of your favorite song.  You jump form the middle of one lyric into the the middle of another.  For seasoned watchers is is nothing but annoying.  For the generation the new effects are suppose to attract, it leaves jumbled stories and confusing situations.  Unfortunately broadcast and other commercial stations are just driving us away.  THAT is why I stay with Amazon.
B008AIGWVA|3.0|Just for fun. The dog is really well designed.<br />Simple and relaxing.<br />Best for children. I'd have liked more game options.
B00EV4EUT8|1.0|As always, the left (looking at you Forest and Oprah) does their level best to make dems look good and repubs look bad.  The most obvious revision was when some dem came to Reagan wanting Reagan to slap sanctions on South Africa.  The film portrayed Reagan as callous to the plight of blacks in South Africa.<br /><br />Nothing could be further from the truth.  Reagan was extremely sensitive to their plight, while democrats remained callous to anything other than their political power.  As with all economic ignorants, this dem failed to think about the economic repercussions to the poor, particularly the poor blacks, in South Africa.  In real life, Reagan didn't sign this sanction because he knew it would hurt these poor blacks.  And in real life, as is typical, dems were more than willing to make poor people's, especially black people's, lives worse off to score some political point.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|BINGO!  Who would think that an app for this would be available with multi-cards.<br />What FUN listening to someone call the numbers and checking them off<br />and being rated with other players; it's quick, keeps you alert listening and<br />getting the numbers.  I recommend this for anyone's KINDLE including<br />children ages 5 and older which helps them to recognize numbers<br />and focus, and happy when they WIN!  IT's GREAT!!!!!
B00A7OIXW6|4.0|Walt Disney ventures into the world of videogames in the fun-filled animated family feature Wreck-It Ralph. Wreck-It Ralph (John C. Reilly) is a misunderstood arcade game villain who longs to be beloved like his kind-hearted nemesis Fix-It Felix (Jack McBrayer), but nobody seems to like a Bad Guy. In order to order to prove himself a real hero, he ventures into the new first-person shooter game Hero's Duty to win a shiny medal, but accidentally unleashes a terrible evil that threatens the entire arcade. Wreck-It Ralph is one of the most entertaining animated films in recent years. It features a creative storyline filled with plenty of heart, emotion and humor, colorful CG animation and memorable characters. The animated movie is also homage to the videogame industry, featuring numerous video game references and iconic characters. Wreck-It Ralph also includes the voice talents of Sarah Silverman, Jane Lynch, Alan Tudyk, Mindy Kaling, Joe Lo Truglio, Dennis Haysbert and Ed O'Neill.<br /><br />Disney's Blu-Ray release of Wreck-It Ralph is well recommended addition to your Blu-Ray collection. The animated feature is presented in 2.39:1 widescreen format. The HD transfer is truly excellent with fine crystal clarity and rich dazzling colors. The 7.1 DTS-HD Master Audio track is certainly first-rate. The key extra in this Blu-Ray release is the Academy-Award-winning animated short Paperman. Other supplemental features include the 17-minute featurette Bit by Bit: Creating the Worlds of Wreck-It Ralph, 14 minutes of deleted and alternate scenes, Disney Intermission hosted by Chris Hardwick and sneak peeks of other Disney titles. Overall, Wreck-It Ralph scores a \\"B+\\".
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I love this series, from the lessons taught to the story line. The writing makes me feel like I'm in the book and part of the story. It's one of those that I would read many times and never tire of it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|This keyboard is my favorite by far, it has wonderful predictions although I haven't gotten used to the swipe feature yet, it seems very intuitive.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So unexpected.  Very compelling and thought provoking.  Thanks for keeping it clean, yet entertaining.  It did have violence, but that is what we humans do - fight to the death to defend our families, our rights, and our country.
B00DQVSTCG|3.0|The video and audio quality was not as good as it could be.  At times you lose the image or have stars.  Its like watching TV on a stormy night back in 90's  The base should have been cranked up.  Its no where near confessions DVD.  I wanted to relive my experience and well you just don't have the quality.
B00CL68QVQ|4.0|I thought this was a likeable flick.  Good acting. The plot was entertaining although over the top of reality at times.
B003M6FGTE|5.0|I have watched a few episodes here and there over the years and I'm so glad I've gone back to the beginning - great season, love the music - such a talented group of people!
0385302320|5.0|Now this is a tale ! It is a breataking part of the Outlander series. This is book that is hard to put down.
B008Y6WO88|4.0|Great movies! I had never seen any of the Resident Evil movies; before my son talked me into this movie. Very happy with this purchase.
B005544V6A|5.0|I love it. It's funny, smart, and entertaining. The acting is decent, production is good quality, and the story line is interesting. Great characters.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is an attention grabber. Once it has you it is very hard to put it down!  Will be grabbing the second book of this series!
B008YW5RH2|5.0|I give this game 5 stars, though the game doesn't have the greatest graphics, I really like the game play and this game is seriously addictive.  I also love it because it's challenging, but not so challenging that it's impossible to bet.  Love it!

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So rarely does anyone like what I like. One might say I have bad taste. I prefer to think of it as broad taste. You can imagine my surprise when I learned that I love the most critically acclaimed show on TV. What's more, it reminds me so much of one of my favorite movies -  Gosford Park (which you should watch if you haven't seen it). A peak into the world of the rich and their servants in the early 20th century sounds boring, but the sharp-as-knives wit and humor make it so much more relatable.
B005FHXB0O|4.0|Stars are all over in this true love film.  Modern day Bonnie & Clyde.  Kept me on the edge my seat, but expect some blood.
B0047SF41G|5.0|good movie<br />would watch it again, it was as good as the first movie. i gave it 5 stars good .
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|This album has fantastic songs! He has the most amazing voice and I am really happy to have this CD!
B00CEJ2H6K|5.0|Great opening song with punishing riffs and excellent production, I highly recommend this. The cover songs were an unexpected bonus.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|I guess I am joining the 154 one star reviews of this product. The product was non-functional out of the box. Black screen with a little colored bar to the left of center screen. Tried the power plug and USB port and got the red power light on the device, but no \\"Set Me Up\\" screen. I ordered the device back in July, and just got it today. Over 40 days waiting for a piece of non-operational hardware. This product is not ready for \\"Prime Time\\", Fix the issues, make sure the product isn't DOA. Hopefully Amazon will respond in a professional manner and refund my money as I will stick with my Apple TV.<br /><br />Dan
B0089EHWQE|4.0|gives a new first hand perspective on the challenges of living with and providing for a paraplegia person  - will enrich your life !
1451695195|2.0|Not what I was hoping for...lost me early ...might go back to it but at this point, it is sitting on my nightstand unopened.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a great game! I do not have any complaints. Most of the ads can be skipped easily enough.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Best of this type of game I have played. I can't wait to see what comes next. Graphics are awesome too!
0425263908|5.0|Love Sylvia Day's Crossfire trilogy.  Just when you think you have the plot line, it changes.  Would recommend if you liked Fifty Shades or the Beautiful Bastard series.
B000001GE5|5.0|One buys this set for the etudes, which are remarkable.  The preludes are done very well, are authoritative, and compete with other great recordings, but the preludes are individual and there are some for which I prefer other artists.  I'm not a fan of the polonaises, finding them awkward and odd.  So if you like the polonaises, test the waters of other reviewers.  The set is a tremendous bargain.  For me, having the preludes along with the etudes at this low price is truly great.
1594744769|2.0|Miss Peregrine's home for peculiar children was peculiar but not in a good way.  I found it to be less than believable and not interesting.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Easy to use. Finds your book, chapter and verse quickly. Much better than flipping pages in my standard Bible looking for the chapters.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I love Sylvia Day's Crossfire series.  If you enjoy reading Fifty Shades of Grey or the Beautiful Bastard series, you will like the Crossfire series also.
B000SEGMAU|5.0|One of my favorites, recommend it highly and will probably give it as gifts!!  6 more words?  isn't this enough??
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  Lot of twists and turns to keep you guessing.  The author does a great job of keeping the story fresh, it's hard to put down.
B000006OAM|5.0|The title song, \\"Ophelia,\\" represents something of a revolutionary act. As starkly portrayed in her video, what Merchant seems to be expressing is the inner experience of a woman caught in the web of D.I.D. - dissociative identity disorder (formerly referred to as \\"multiple personality disorder,\\" and historically commonly confused with schizophrenia). The reality of this condition, a psychologically protective and adaptive response to overwhelmingly traumatic experience, is still widely, vehemently denied. The denial persists even in relevant professional arenas, in spite of the fact that it's been included in the DSM, the bible of medical references, for years now, and in spite of the fact that it's not the \\"rare\\" condition even those who acknowledge its existence would like to believe. Bravo, Natalie! (see: [...] for a poetic take on this phenomenon - and response to this song.)
B001VZY4M8|5.0|Cannot go wrong with Mr. Young. I was just telling my husband yesterday as I passed by his studio....if I hear Neil Young's music coming out of it I know all is right with his world.
B003A2JBW8|5.0|Great stuff. A bit expensive though. Wish these toys were a bit cheaper so that one could purchase more. Very nice box and easy instructions.
0345803485|1.0|The writing is horrible and that includes the sex scenes.<br /><br />Ana is naive and a hot mess.<br /><br />Christian has no redeeming qualities unless it's his good looks, money and well-endowed ... well, you know. He's an abusive and controlling stalker. Cruel, condenscending, possessive, and jealous. On the one hand, we get the message that Ana (naive and inexperienced as she is) can change him into a good person. On other hand, she admits over and over that she's afraid of him. Well, she should be! Um, that's domestic violence right there...........Christian Grey should be in prison.<br /><br />If Christian were old, ugly and poor we'd all agree that he was a creep and call the cops.<br /><br />I made it through the book, barely. I won't be watching the movie and I won't be reading the rest of the trilogy. This book in no way mirrors my morals or values and I wouldn't wish a man like Christian Grey on my worst enemy.<br /><br />I selected this book only because I needed an ebook to read on short notice and it was at the top of my search list and I'd heard it was good. Next time I'll be more selective.
B005G0ETV0|5.0|Searched for this for my father-in law.. He plays the piano, used to teach piano, has read Arthur Rubinstein's two books (and lost them, so they have recently been replaced by copies bought via amazon). I came across this collection while finding copies of the books. He had an old VHS tape with Rubinstein playing, and was interested in this collection when I mentioned it had the Israel concert DVD, the documentary DVD, hard bound book, and of course the ultimate collection of his recordings.<br /><br />After reading reviews I was careful to have the collection sent to me so I could check the quality and completeness before giving it to him. I checked every disc to ensure there was no double ups or missing disc's. As far as I could tell, every disc is properly labelled and numbered. No discs missing. Package looks great. CD jackets are hard to read (get a magnifying glass like my father in-law) but the printing and images are stunning, so are the CD's themselves - all looking like vinyl records. The Hard bound book looks and feels good quality. I watched both DVD's to ensure they worked here in Australia. Sound and vision is fine, concert playing is great and the documentary interesting. I randomly played half a dozen discs in a portable CD player...they all worked... would have sounded better in a player with a graphic equaliser...but were still worthy of listening to. I played the same discs through my home entertainment system....turned the volume up... sounds fantastic..<br /><br />I personally was very impressed.. the quality and what you get for the price is mind blowing... I can not imagine buying a Beatles, Pink Floyd or Fleetwood Mac box collection with every album and single recorded remastered, enhanced, old tracks, B-sides, every major concert recording, previously unreleased tracks, plus a concert DVD, documentary DVD, plus a quality hardbound book.. for anywhere near the cost of this collection. This collection is fantastic value for money!<br /><br />My father in-law took one look at the box when I gave it to him and he said &#34;WOW!.. This really is something special.. this is a collector item...&#34; and is wondering &#34;...who would appreciate it the most...&#34; meaning who should inherit it. He is keeping the Collections box in the shipping box...so as to keep it...in collector condition. He loves the quality of the book, I left him happily planning when to watch the DVDs and start listening to the CDs. He has a portable CD player and a DVD player to listen to the discs with. I told him when I delivered the collection to him.. that he might want to go out and buy a better player...
B00D8HNR2K|5.0|My girlfriend and I disagree on NIN's new album. She is in the, \\"I liked Trent better when he was on drugs\\", camp, and I appreciate his new stuff much more than she does. She was an original NIN fan, with a crusty old copy of Pretty Hate Machine and stubs from his shows from the 90's. I never disliked NIN, I just lived in a bubble and wasn't really aware of them, other than hearing Closer thru osmosis here and there, they just weren't on my radar until With Teeth came out. I loved that album and everything since, and have gone back and become a fan of everything previous. I appreciate Trent Reznor's body of work without being caught up in how awesome the early years and MTV mania was around the Downward Spiral time, and being disappointed with things that didn't live up to that. I never had a romanticized view of Trent, like my girlfriend, and even Howard Stern, who this morning spoke of how he thought he was a really twisted, evil, macabre genius, only to be let down seeing Trent cleaned up, sober, wearing a suit although he does like the new album. So, as an objective fan of the pure music of Nine Inch Nails, I love how every album has been different, and has evolved as Trent has, in what he sings about and the music itself. Hesitation Marks starts off with 2 great, dark, yet danceable tracks that I can't get out of my head, and the rest of the album settles into more of a slower, driving, sensual groove that is 100% NIN without repeating earlier successes. Even the one standout, pop sounding song, Everything, starts off oddly happy, but changes to something darker as it goes. Like all of his work, and any really great album, one listen is not enough to soak it all in and really appreciate the nuances. I know a large number of fans can't get past the electronic drum machine, but i think it works for this album. Overall, another masterpiece.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|My wife is addicted to this show.  It's ridiculous.  Most soaps are, but, this one is ridiculous.  The antagonists and protagonists switch all the goddam time...
B009THT1IM|5.0|My kids love reading this book!  Just a fun story for all ages.  The illustrations are a joy and add to the laughter of the story.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I have been unpatiently waiting for this to come out...and its here! Its so cool. I love the tank with the heads, looks very impressive on my book case!!!
B00008BLAS|5.0|I owned this record when it came out as a teenager.  Having also owned &#34;We're an American Band&#34;, I was expecting something similar.  I admit I was a trifle disappointed, since the band seemed to have gone in a different direction, musically.  Well, I was wrong.  They were simply evolving and I think they'd gotten better.  Being considerably older now, I can appreciate the lyrical content to a greater degree.
B00ECU2RGY|2.0|Looked like a good cast and an intriuiging story.  It was boring, yes boring.  No charactor development, slow, slow first three quarters of the movie.  Very disappointing!
B008602KQI|3.0|i couldn't get past the first hour of fluff in this movie. the drama and costumes not to my liking, i wanted to see more actual action of the games ...............maybe i will try again
1475143389|5.0|This is the perfect book for anyone who wants to build a great body and learn the science of how to do it. It explained everything that I needed to know and laid out work outs and proper dieting for my goals. It is a great read and will help anyone who wants to learn more about nutrition, dieting, and building muscle mass.
B000SGGUWS|4.0|I started reading this book because I've really gotten into the T.V show. I thought this was a good book. The author has a lot of character's she's juggling and each one has their own story. I think my favorite person she follows is Aria or Spencer. Lots of mystery with their friend Ali and the random texts they receive from -A. It's not my \\"favorite\\" book I've read, but I still think it's pretty cool.
B003Q6D1YW|4.0|Not bad. can't say much more than that. Hard to write a review on something like this. Hope u like it.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Well to begin I give this book five stars because it deserves it. I really hadn't expected much from this book when someone recommended this book. In the end I loved the story even though at time the main character Clary got me a little frustrated for being so impulsive. Anyways I would recommend this book to anyone who is willing to read something new or just likes this genre in general
B00E0MCYPS|1.0|Nice graphics.  Poor controls. Good sound effects. If the controls are enhanced, this game could be a five star app.
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|picture quality was horrid, have hd television yet the quality was super extremely grainy, would love to see the movie by purching the original dvd.
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|I like the game but you don't get enough coins and it steals the chances of winning with the glitches. Play the Kingdom Coin dozed better. They are both free but the other game you get more coins.
B00EB6F1TY|1.0|It's crap. I disliked every aspect of it.No one should waste time on this video. It was ordered as a promotion by Amazon by mistake without an opportunity to cancel.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|So glad to see another season. This is a great show. Can't wait to watch each week. Hate summer break.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Writing, acting, casting, sets, wardrobe...everything about all three seasons of Downton Abbey has been superlative.  We can't wait for Season 4!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|Loved the grace and dignity that Steinbeck used to write about this very important historical event. The characters and story line still ring true today for migrant workers all over the world.  I now understand why this boo won both the Pulitzer Prize and the Nobel Peace Prize for Literature.  Everyone should read this book!!!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I have been using TWC app on my kindle fire for about 2 years and have been extremely happy with it. the new update though has me frustrated beyond belief. I loathe this new version for two reasons:<br />1) it rarely ever works. 9 out of 10 times I try to open it I just get a blank black screen. and then - and this my favorite part - my kindle freezes and must be shut down and restarted; and<br />2) it isn't very user-friendly, has lots of other unnecessary junk going on and the layout style isn't appealing.<br />I would not recommend this app and will be deleting it from my device. I would give it 0 stars if I could.
B004T32SOK|5.0|This works great all my pictures and files are saved and its good app I use it all time. There is never an issue easy to use
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I couldn't help but wonder if the author knows or has lived with a quadriplegic. I so wish she'd written this book and I'd read it twenty years ago. My 17 year old handsome, strapping, football playing cousin lost the use of his limbs when a vehicle rolled over on him. In the ensuing years, he begged his family to help him commit suicide. None could bring himself or herself to do that. He died of natural causes about 10 years later. Ms. Moyes has written about this topic with incredible insight, tenderness, understanding, humor, and sadness and all without being maudlin. I believe her words would have helped me understand my cousin's desparation and rage. I'm not sure how that would have changed my behavior but I'd like to think I would have been more compassionate. I haven't yet read any other of Ms. Moyes' books, but I intend to. It's hard to say I &#34;loved&#34; this book simply because of the subject matter. But I did find it to be well-written and one that I looked forward to reading at day's end.
B000FC1PNE|5.0|I enjoyed reading this one, the wallflower gets the man of her dreams, finally! But then I love  all the Bridgerton siblings! It has always been my fav series of books, to follow each of their stories & get tidbits of the previous siblings marriages. Seeing that still have their &#34;happily ever after&#34;!  So you need to get this one, you won't regret it!
B006ZZC3D6|5.0|I like the fact that it is a quick game that you can do to relax a few minutes or you can continue playing for a long time, never gets old or boring.  It is challenging to figure out how to clear the board down to one left without using a hint.
B00EY8A6BC|5.0|Wonderful cast, lots of action, and magic! This movie was very entertaining, and fun to enjoy with the whole family.
B00846WWVM|3.0|I like to get the full amount of reward at the end of each session, but find it impossible to do that with this game.  Instead of stars you get water drops and five is the full amount which is very hard to obtain.  It stresses me a little, so I only play when I feel like being really challenged and have patience to deal with the game without getting too stressed.
B001TAJGO6|5.0|I would recommend this movie for anyone who has just been through a break up.  Makes you really think about what draws you to people and what tears your apart as well.
B00821OX98|4.0|Great Sci-Fi series with a good story line and action with plenty of suspense. I highly recommend this series for streaming.
B0039208CG|3.0|This is the best Batman of the early Batman movies. Val Kilmer portrayed  the best Batman character compared to Michael Keaton or George Clooney. A good explanation of the Robin character.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|I travel a lot on business.  Prowling for an open power outlet in an airport, restaurant or rental car is no longer a problem.  This battery recharges my Galaxy 2 at least 3 times. Great for vacation or business trips. Neat design. The integrated charging cord is a must have. Flashlight is a nice touch.Comes with great accessory charging cables.  Never more to run out of battery. Nice.
1781162646|5.0|I am a big Stephen King fan and when I heard he wrote a book in the pulp fiction style of the 1960s I knew I had to read it. I like that he did not release this in Kindle and it is only paperback. It is not the horror of King that many may expect. The ending (not giving anything away of course) was a twist I wasn't expecting. I enjoyed this book and will read it again.
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This is a non typical good guy versus bad guy ....  lots of kick ass and some love stuff  for the girls
B005LAIISA|5.0|Another purchase for my grandson who really loves the whole series.  I just have 1 more to buy for him.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I have just about every version of this title and love them all for different reasons. The length of this one allows for a great deal of detail and really brings out the full story as written
B000MV9026|5.0|Purchased this also for my grandson, especially for use in the car when they travel any distance as it keeps him nice and occupied.  Cute movie.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|This is my favorite version of Emma. I will be looking for more titles to further expand my collection. Love it.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Janelle Monae is a wonderfully unique artist, with a sound all her own, and that has never been more apparent than on her sophomore effort, The Electric Lady. Much has already been made of the underlining themes that run rampant across her latest effort, but being a bit of a Neanderthal, I'll only focus on the sonic (how it sounds) quality of the album, for the most part.<br /><br />As with her previous, and sensational, albums [[ASIN:B001B9ZVW6 Metropolis: The Chase Suite]] and [[ASIN:B002ZFQD0E The ArchAndroid]], The Electric Lady follows the story of Cindi Mayweather, an android who committed the crime of falling in love with a human. Similarly in line with her previous efforts, the album is broken into \\"suites\\". Her first effort, Metropolis, was suite 1, the ArchAndroid contained 2 and 3, while The Electric Lady contains 4 and 5.<br /><br />Suite 4 starts off with a growl on her track with Prince, \\"Givin' em what they love\\", a guitar laden, funk heavy, gravelly voiced exercise in perfection, which is immediately followed by \\"Q.U.E.E.N., Janelle's empowering first single featuring Erykah Badu. From there, suite 4 sizzles along with songs \\"Electric Lady\\" featuring Solange Knowles, \\"Primetime\\" featuring Miguel, fast paced thrill ride \\"We Were Rock & Roll\\", her radio friendly single \\"Dance Apocalyptic\\" and \\"Look into My Eyes\\".<br /><br />Suite 5 has a much grander feel than the upbeat Suite 4, and its stand out tracks, again for me personally, would be : the amazing homage to \\"[[ASIN:B00004SZWD Songs in the Key of Life]] era Stevie, and song thanking her mother for all her hard work, Ghetto Woman, the smooth \\"Can't live without your love\\", and the beautiful closer \\"What an Experience\\".<br /><br />While I loved her previous effort, the ArchAndroid, there were tracks on there that just never clicked with me, and I am happy to say no such tracks exist on The Electric Lady, except three especially superfluous skits that, while interesting at first, in no way merit repeat listening.<br /><br />Altogether, Janelle Monae has put together an amazing album filled with heady themes and philosophical undertones. If you are like me however, you aren't worried about any of that and are just here for the sweet, sweet music, and thankfully Ms.Monae has also managed to deliver spectacularly on that front as well. A superior, ground breaking effort from a visionary artist, and a new classic. It is exceptional and absolutely worthy of a purchase; a must buy.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Parts were fine but overall not to good. I. guess I am too much of a reader to enjoy this book.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I cant wait to read the next one and see where this awesome story is going! I look forward to see the movie as well!
B004J4WKTW|5.0|It was a very magical story and I could envision every scene in my mind. It was interesting and mystical and I loved it.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|In the spirit of a good memoir, this is a riveting story with a genuine voice.  As much as I enjoyed it, I did have the distinct sense that the Piper Kerman &#34;held back&#34; many details that would've added more intrigue, interest and substance to the book.  It's certainly understandable why this might be the case:  to protect  the privacy of those involved, legal limitations related to the publishing of the book, and the author's own need to keep parts of her experience just for herself and out of the public forum...I understand the reasons, but the book still left me feeling a bit &#34;empty&#34; in that I didn't get the nitty gritty of the whole inside story...it had a guarded undertone.  Definitely an engrossing read for those who love the memoir circuit but probably not as bold and raw as it might have been.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I enjoyed this book very much. It held my interest and the characters were very well developed. I felt somewhere in the middle it lost a little authenticity, and was a little predictable, but I enjoyed it nonetheless. It was a quick & easy read and very descriptive. You could really imagine the scenes and characters.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I enjoy the game but the way that you receive coins is too slow.  In order to play for more than a couple of minutes each day , you need to purchase coins and they are costly.  There is no instructions so I may be missing something with the prizes other than coins.
B001M3WPY8|5.0|a big production from MGM  with sumptuous technicolor and a star in every role. Big and brassy the way they used to make em but not really Dumas . Kelly with a sword in his hand is splendid otherwise it so much  Allyson was about to put me into sugar schock.but Heflin is fine in a role that Robert Taylor turned down.
B004LWZW42|5.0|After watching this movie in the theater, I had to get it.  I waited a while because I was never the type of person to have to go and be the first person to have something.<br /><br />But this movie is awesome and I can't wait til the next X Men movie.
B000JZ3TYA|5.0|Still one of my favorite movies...the only problem is that you need to wait a few years before you want to see it again...the ending is so amazing!
B0083SBMBM|4.0|This movie was awesome.  It is super duper long though.  But it is truly worth it.  I enjoyed every minute of it.
B00EE3FTNM|5.0|Superb acting, beautifully shot, riveting story.  Already on my second watch through picking up overlooked details from my first go round.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Great album<br /><br />Much better album than I anticipated!<br /><br />It's a breath of fresh air amongst all of these wack albums that artist are putting out these days.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Great CD and DVD. Love the song selection and the concept behind it . The musicians are very talented. THANKS!!!
B00594XOZU|3.0|This app is recommended by Amazon to be good for a kindle. It seems to work well and all but you don't have any access to anything but your own profile photo and the person you want to send a message to. So the settings does not exist on the kindle. I prefer to send messages on my kindle because I like the size of the keys on it better than on my phone and the screen size best on the kindle.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love how its real.  You think the story would have been so comfortable because they have the monies.. but NO they don't and it mixes in with the help who are the backside of the story. Love it
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Couldn't stop watching. Had a marathon and watched all three seasons. Disappointed I had to stop to eat and sleep.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game a lot of fun Its a real Brian teaser. I Love these kind of games and this game is best one jet.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The books were great! I gat them on cyber Monday last year so I got them all for 9 buck but have to say any price is worth reading the hunger games
B001DCZ4IW|5.0|Classic, quirky and fun.  I haven't see it in 20 yrs but have thought of it now & again. It is a memorable movie
B008ALA6DW|2.0|the adapter doesn't work. i have a macbook air 2013 and i needed this to connect my laptop to the internet at home but the adapter isn't even read by my computer. when the adapter is plugged in, it is as if it were not. doesn't work.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Heard the book on tape a while ago and decided to reread the book. Great decision on my part as I'm finding it enjoyable.
B00455IVHU|4.0|Enjoyed the movie, but not watch it again.  Interesting plot, but not exactly the most riveting movie I have ever seen.
B00001QEE8|5.0|This book was a gift to a nephew in our family.  The book was a favorite of my wife when she was a child and the characters bring back good memories.  When this is read to the nephew a great deal of animation is brought out.  Very entertaining for the reader and the child.
B008YZ4RR0|5.0|Again, I can not say enough about the Jesse Stone series.  It is great.  Good story, great actor, and wonderful scenes.
B000AP04MO|5.0|The actors in this movie were very good well matched for the parts.  We especially enjoyed that the movie was not xxx rated which is most of what we can get on television these days.
1400069289|5.0|I found this book so very interesting that I gave several copies away to friends.  I have read it twice.  I highly recommend this book for people that are interested in this sort of thing.
B0067Q42BY|3.0|played it very much.  I've enjoyed the games I've played so far, mostly straightforward mahjong so if you like mahjong you should enjoy this game.
B00ECUARO8|5.0|The story in this film is fantastic. The parallels between the adults and child actors is riveting. The boys steal the scenes in this film reminiscent of Stand By Me.
B009AY04A8|4.0|Pretty good hidden objects game.  Very easy to play, nice graphics, so far I've had no problems on my kindle. Seems to use a bit of battery but most games I have do so I wouldn't count off for that reason.
0880293225|4.0|The ideas are a little far fetched in some cases, but overall provides good ideas and new ways of thinking.
B00DZVKQGY|5.0|I enjoyed this book and found it easy to connect with the characters. Jams N Roses has done a great job with this one and I look forward to reading more from this author.
B00CEIGYAG|5.0|I love that Daft is becoming more radio friendly and popular. They are a great band, but if you want to sing along, this song is perfect
B006M4F67A|1.0|this is fun until some levels you get to jump time by at least a minute so it almost makes it impossible to move ahead.  thats when it gets boring and ready to uninstall it.  NO I WOULD NOT PURCHASE UNTIL THIS IS CHANGED.
B00BEXB18M|3.0|I've been a Megadeth fan since the beginning and it seems to me that they may just be fresh out of ideas. This album is mediocre at best. I wish it wasn't so, but there it is. If you like the stuff they have been writing for the last few years, you'll probably like it as it's just another one of those. Come on guys, go back to your hard rocking roots!!
B00AFROVQC|3.0|Slow starter that slowly picks up momentum and intrigue as the story and characters start to gain momentum and depth.<br />Will leave you wanting for the next chapter in this story which looks to be on a epic scale.
B00CXQL828|4.0|For any of you fans who were expecting Dream Theater, this isn't it. Why would you expect that anyway? It is, however, an excellent, hard rock debut effort by the best rhythm section in the business (IMHO). Give it an honest listen, it's a great album.
B00992CF6W|1.0|don't buy this game the world are small and for me the first world deletied on its own. so don't buy it
B00479SVBU|4.0|I made a good choice in buying the AUX model.  Why kill your phone with the BlueTooth model?  I use the SD card.  It has good sound quality.  Love the track info broadcast to stereo, but I don't need to see SATECHI every 10 seconds.  That cuts the track name off sometimes.  Occasionally when turn it on there is no audio; have to turn it off then back on.  Remote could be a little stronger.
B002SKZBQS|3.0|I felt this was not quite up to Mr. Kings normal works. At times it seemed as though he were just trying to fill pages. The premise was good, however the ending was no real surprise.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|This would be a great ap if only.............. I am not sure if this is just my issue or others are having this problem.  The android ap never syncs to the furthest read place on my Kindle.  This creates an issue for me and forces me to carry my kindle around with me instead of being able to switch between the two.  I rarly use the kindle ap on my droid because of this......<br /><br />Since posting this reveiw i have discovered the problem thanks to searching the kindle forum.  If you are having issues with your droid synching with your kindle.  close the book on your kindle before you sync with the droid ap.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I bought this for my husband. He was thrilled. He says that the quality of the older movies on blue ray is amazing. I am not into Star Wars, but I would take his word for it.
B008Y6S07M|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. Shows the struggles and the amount of shear will power it takes to get to success. Even then that doesn't guarantee happiness though.
1439136653|1.0|I only read one or two chapters. It was so filthy I could not continue reading it. Actually I threw the book away.
0596805888|5.0|A nice introduction to the technical aspects of cooking.<br /><br />Geared for beginners (I knew nothing) it summarizes a range of aspects to cooking.  It includes narratives on equipment, philosophy, ingredients, chemical reactions, gustatory senses, and recipes.  A fun and enlightening casual read, highly recommended.
B004K58GSO|5.0|Great American Classic John Wayne Western. The film really brings out the feel of the southwestern rancher. I can watch the film over and over.
0525952926|5.0|this book gives you a look at history and how people react to war.it shows how countries get involved and comet to fight.
B000FBFM9S|2.0|Unfocused and rambling. Characters tend to be stereotypes. Author wrote some humorous lines but mostly it was a bore. The &#34;surprise&#34; wasn't  & no point to the ending.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|I'll take the original over this version.  Weak story line (no expectation of quality acting).  Glad I didn't pay the $ to see it in the theater.
0743233832|5.0|Although having a formation as an archeologist and ancient historian I never read the Meditations of Marc Aurel. No doubt because a kind fate wanted to give me with this excellent translation the full impact of the personal reflections of one of the most astonishing leaders in world's history. It's deeply moving and gives you the motivation to work a bit more on yourself. All my thanks to the authors for their devoted and excellent job.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Interesting to say the very least, I couldn't put it down! Suspenseful, and keeps you on your toes. Loved it!
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie!  A really different perspective about Hansel and Gretal.  I love the twist in the story line.  It is certainly more fun.  I have to watch on DVD/Blu-ray because of subtitles for HoH.  Rarely do I go to movies.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Very fun game and addictive too....very easy to install and modify the settings. Great graphics too. Easy to play....4+ stars.
B00DDXJRJG|5.0|I listen to podcast all the time and some of them have terrible audio quality. With this app I can brighten or diminish the highs add warmth and remove the mud. This program allows me  to remove the listener fatigue that comes with poor audio.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Pulls you in and keeps you there!  I love Juliana M.  Excellent storylines and really really great acting.  I'm hooked.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|Time Killer was a cover to cover reader. A story that is fairly polished with the exception of a couple of words that were spelled wrong this book was good. The serial killer is cold and very calculated while he is being slowly unraveled by two hot shot officers Jessie and Max. As the case is unraveled there is taunting and haunting of the past in the officers head which leaves for an interesting twist to the story I never seen coming. This is a good murder mystery driven by a new crazy but novel idea of time. I could easily see a movie made out of this that would bring a fair amount of proceeds. Surely a thriller to say the least. I will warn you the depictions at times are twisted and a bit bloody, so keep this in mind. While the author doesn't spend too much time on the gore of the killings there is enough there to scare the faint of heart. I would have to say exactly this gets a 4.8 out of 5.0 stars. I will likely loan this book to my spouse as she reads a lot of murder mysteries.
1250030951|5.0|-------------------------Review Originally Posted on Swoony Boys Podcast--------------------------<br /><br />**The 411**<br /><br />Cath and Wren are identical twins who are headed off to college. For the first time in their lives they aren't sharing a room and while Wren is happy about it, Cath isn't sure what to think. She may not have Wren, but she still has her fanfiction, a snarky roommate, and her roommates boyfriend who is always around. Everything is new and different. But maybe, just maybe, different isn't so bad.<br /><br />**What We Loved**<br /><br />We knew as soon as we read the summary that we desperately needed to read this one. That's not true, we knew as soon as we saw that Rainbow had another book coming out that we needed to read it. She stole our hearts with Eleanor & Park, and without a doubt made our love for her grow with Fangirl.<br /><br />Here are a few of our favorite things:<br /><br />The Feels- Without a doubt this book will have you feeling everything. It's honest and full of all of the emotions. That's right, all of them.<br /><br />The Fan-Fiction Aspect- We'll be honest, this is the part that we related with Cath with the most. (Well that and all the Levi kissing!) We know exactly what it feels like to get so immersed, so lost in a world that you don't want to do anything else. We owe our friendship to this kind of obsession. Rainbow Rowell perfectly described what it means to be in a fandom and to be a fangirl.<br /><br />The Characters- Every person in Fangirl leaps of the page. There is so much depth to them, and at the same time, so much more you want to know.<br /><br />Levi - We'll get to him later, but he deserved to be mentioned here too.<br /><br />The Romance - It's not secret that we hate insta-love, although it's something that runs wild in most fan-fiction fandoms. We were a little worried about that with this one but we are happy to say that you won't find a trace of it. Instead you get the sweetest, slowest, perfectest (we don't even care that that's not a word) kind of love story. It's so real, so raw, so new... and exactly what we were hoping for.<br /><br />We could go on and on, but by the time we finish I'm not sure we would leave anything unspoiled. Just promise us that as soon as you read it you'll tell us so we can talk all about it.<br /><br />**Ummm...Not So Much**<br /><br />What didn't we love??? Is that really a question? If we have to answer, which I guess we don't since we're in charge around here, we will mention a couple of things that weren't on our favorite list.<br /><br />- Levi's hairline. We don't mind that it was receding, but sometimes we wish Cath didn't notice it so much.<br /><br />- Levi and \\"the situation that shall not be named\\". It's not so much that we don't want to spoil you as we just really don't want to talk about it.<br /><br />-Cath and Wren's \\"mom\\"...enough said.<br /><br />**The Boys**<br /><br />Where do we even start? Cath was right. Levi is \\"magical.\\" He's the perfect mix of farm boy, geek, and major swooner. We love him from the second he appeared on the page. With an \\"official\\" intro like this, who could resist:<br /><br />\\"Look...\\" Cath said. \\"I can't just let strange guys in my room. I don't even know your name. This whole situation is too rapey.\\"<br /><br />\\"Rapey?\\"<br /><br />\\"You understand,\\" she said, \\"right?\\"<br /><br />He dropped an eyebrow and shook his head, still smiling. \\"Not really. But now I don't want to come in with you. The word \\"rapey\\" makes me uncomfortable.\\"<br /><br />\\"Me, too,\\" she said gratefully.<br /><br />He leaned against the wall and slid back onto the floor, looking up at her. Then he held up his hand. \\"I'm Levi, by the way.\\"<br /><br />We love that he understands Cath, that he just gets her. He doesn't judge her for her \\"fangirlishness\\" he actually encourages it. He's older, more experienced, more everything really and he doesn't let that get between them either. Add all of that to his amazing words...and we couldn't help but love him. Just look at this:<br /><br />\\"You're not the ugly one.\\" Levi grinned. \\"You're just the Clark Kent.\\"<br /><br />Cath started checking her email.<br /><br />\\"Hey, Cath,\\" Levi said, kicking her chair. She could hear the teasing in his voice. \\"Will you warn me when you take off your glasses?\\"<br /><br />and this...<br /><br />\\"I mean...\\" Levi leaned forward, hands still fisted in his pockets. \\"I mean, I spent four months trying to kiss you and the last six weeks trying to figure out how I managed to f*** everything up. All I want now is to make it right, to make you see how sorry I am and why you should give me another chance. And I just want to know-- are you rooting for me? Are you hoping I pull this off?\\"<br /><br />There aren't really words to properly describe how much we love Levi. Let's just say this- In our group of friends we are each allowed two exclusive \\"book boyfriends\\" that no one else can claim as theirs. Both of us have kept our second spot open because we knew a boy would eventually come along that we could claim and everyone would be sick with jealousy because they had already filled both of their spots. Meg decided after reading Fangirl that she'd finally found the boy who deserved her second spot. Of course, she almost always shares with Kass. Lucky Levi... LUCKY US!<br /><br />**The Girls**<br /><br />Before we tell you all the things we love about our heroine, we think it's only fair to say that we have plenty of nice things to say about Reagan and Wren too, (Although there are so not so nice things we could say about Wren too!) but we want to focus on Cath.<br /><br />We love her for all her awkward adorableness. We love her for her naiveness, her whit, and her fears. At some point in everyone's life they find themselves lost in the newness of something. That's Cath's story. For the first time in her 18 years she finds herself facing new situations every single day and doing them without the comfort of her sister by her side. She feels alone, scared, and overwhelmed. We've been there, we've felt those things and we can't get over how vulnerable and just... real Cath is.<br /><br />Now part of that may sound sad, and at times her story is exactly that. But when she's happy? Oh, man does this girl do happy right too! She's one of those main characters that we would love to be friends with, especially with narrative like this:<br /><br />\\"Look at you. You've got your s*** together; you're not scared of anything. I'm scared of everything. And I'm crazy. Like maybe you think I'm a little crazy, but I only ever let people see the tip of my crazy iceberg.

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|buttons on thumb side are to low and the are constantly in my way. rubber on this mouse makes my fingers sweat. overall hold feel Is amazing but button design and material that suppose to keep mouse smooth is not what it should be.<br />overall is good mouse with poor engineering, I dont like it personally but I  will give it a time and try to get used to it<br /><br />the Anker company offers me replacement mouse and must say it suits my needs much better. new mouse they send me is wonderful and wouldnt change it for anything<br /><br />THANK YOU ANKER
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This book was one of the greatest books I have EVER read. Honestly it might be the best, I'm so glad the epilogue was written. I would have been in suspension for many years. It's exciting to know that Peeta and Katniss finally got married, and had KIDS!!! :) Super awesome book, I never thought that Peeta would be the same, but boy was I wrong! Well anyways this is a stupendous book, and I LOVE it. Thank you Suzanne Collins!!! :)
0307887960|5.0|On step one - go far it is working!  5 days into plan and 5 lbs down.  so far so good.
B007THA4FI|3.0|The story dragged on for way too long, bogged down in local political details.  It just wasn't that interesting, at least to me.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|Enjoyable, thought provoking. Well acted and executed. Compelling story. Beautiful scenery, Great visual effects.  - its like a religious event
0375869026|5.0|I bought this book after seeing a list of the best children books as reccomended by childrens librarians and it does not disappoint.  One of the best books we have ever read as a family.  I have so far lent this book to 3 cowokers for their kids to read and each one has absolutely LOVED it!
B0061QD88S|5.0|Love this movie, when I realized I didn't have it in my collection of Dvd's I immediately searched Amazon for the Dvd.  Thank you for the quick shipping and having this in stock.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I have been using this app on my kindle fire for months now but all of a sudden it won't open at all. Just a black screen and it shuts it off. So sad. Love Pinterest
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|I didn't get a chance to see this in theaters, but it would have been well worth it. I was a bit confused about the plot towards the middle, but once things cleared up, i was captivated by it. I watched it twice!
B008GXHOFW|4.0|My son loves this game and the graphics are amazing.  I found myself watching him play as if it was a movie.
193700788X|3.0|I was a Sookie Stackhouse Novel addict and this book just wasn't a good fix. I was disappointed with how the character lines wrapped up. After all the effort put into the novels it seemed like the author took the easiest way out while ending the series. It was a quick read, but not my favorite.
B005TMSN4E|5.0|It works just great on my Nikon V1.  I have trouble getting the auto focus to work sometimes, but I'm not sure if the camera should auto-focus in the mode I'm using.  The manual focus worked as described. The pictures of a sunset in St. Maarten with the FT-1 adapter & Nikon 80-400 zoom lens are fantastic.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|My 6 year old granddaughter loves this movie. After watching it I was a little bewildered about that.  Sure, the princess is a great example of strength & courage, but she is also very selfish & self-centered. Because she is so headstrong she causes a great deal of danger & heartbreak to her family,
B005LAIGNC|4.0|Good illustration of the prejudices blacks faced in the military.  Some of the presentation was a bit over board.  Nonetheless, it is a good to movie to watch.
B006Y5H74W|5.0|5stars because the show is fantastic - love the music.  Best part is that I have Amazon Prime so I can watch it for free! Thanks Amazon
B0085Z8F4A|3.0|My kids liked this movie to a point.  The 3D version is impressive.  As for myself, it did not make too much sense for my viewing.  As a result, I really have not watch it with very much interest.
B005544TRQ|5.0|This is a great fun to watch.  The serious business of law being used for intrigue and manipulation in the great world of high finance .  They are people of integrity playing a game in life.
B005LAIGSC|4.0|Denzel Washington, what else can you say.  However, if you are not a Denzel Washington fan, you may find this movie a little over board and boring.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|I have loved these guys for years and couldn't wait to get this.  I love it..  They all sound great.  Amazon you are tops in getting things first and getting it out to your customers and it arrived well before indicated.  However, your cd mailers could really use more protective packaging.  I have received several broken cases from you.
B004EPYZP8|4.0|I really liked this movie and have watched it several times.  It kind of give you a picture of how our judicial system works if you have money and a smart lawyer.
B00005JKDR|5.0|received faster than i expected. just like new. no scratches. all cover inserts. my kids have watched it like 10 since n still like new. will order from again. thanks
0740797719|5.0|This book is well made with beautiful illustrations.  James Gurney shares his  talents and gives me inspiration to another world.  I almost feel like I know him.  He teaches magic with color.  I use this book often and feel the wonder of his work when I paint.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Very informative. He laid out everything very nicely to support his thinking. Made me think about things I've taken for granted for years.
B00005N9CV|4.0|I liked this so much that I sent one to my daughter in Connecticut.  She loves it too. Thank you.
B005HSGB6W|4.0|Nadsat, worth studying to demonstrate your pretentious pathology for having people disassociate themselves from your vicinity. I appreciate Burgess coming clean about writing this while taking a dump, a metaphorical voiding of crap floating around his brain. Reading is fun.
0740785508|5.0|Have learned a lot from the artist.  The colors.  The tints.  And his imagination has helped me in my art works.  I pick up this book often and every time it give me more inspiration.  He is not like other artists.  He shares his knowledge which others seem to think they are too special to let anyone know their secrets.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|Like reading Section A of those dead tree publications that Grandma read to have something interesting to repeat to Aunt Kazameire about everyday at lunch, dinner and Wheel of Fortune.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|The whole movie is like a music video;  everything moves and swirls (for no apparent dramatic reason).  The magic tricks, meant to amaze, are tired and predictable, made even more so by the &#34;magic&#34; of movie production.  I gave up caring about 20 minutes in, and when all was revealed at the end it was too late, I was already snoozing.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|An easy carefree game that's not overly taxing. A nice way to relax and destress after a day at work.
B001F12J48|5.0|It is as magical as ever!  One copy is to be given as a prize at my grandsons birthday party in October, he is having a Polar Express theme.
B00B9LNLTQ|5.0|Don't believe the anti-hype, The Strokes are still great as ever. Catchy 80's melodies, more synths, and great guitar as always. Biggest difference is Julian's falsetto, but he's been expanding his vocals and trying new stuff since First Impressions. Sounds really beautiful at times too, like in Call It Fate and in the chorus to One Way Trig. I love it.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I was wondering why one of my Facebook contacts was fascinated by this movie so i decided to check it out. I liked it. It was funny and warm and funny again. As for the minions, I really loved watching them. They were too hilarious. Glad i rented it, and you will be glad too.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|Can Janelle Monae match 2011's masterful \\"The ArchAndroid\\"? The answer is too right she can. Ms Monae may cut a diminutive figure but has a talent as big as a continent and the best funk songwriting credentials this side of Prince. The purple genius is also to be found on this new album \\"The Electric Lady\\" crooning along with the Atlanta chanteuse on the blues funk of \\"Given them all my love\\". It is one of many sterling collaborations on a record which is a daring and massively inventive throughout. It places Monae in pole position when it comes to producing wildly commercial psychedelic funk pop. Hover your needle over any part of the 19 tracks on \\"The Electric Lady\\" and rich rewards flow. From the joyous rush of \\"Dance Apocalyptic\\" full of pounding rhythms and zombie references- to the nasty funk of Q.U.E.E.N featuring Eryeka Badu - this new album is a veritable jukebox of potential hits.<br /><br />Again underpinning the album is Monae's playful concept of the personality of Cindy Mayweather her messianic android alter-ego. If you like that sort of thing then fine, but frankly it's the music that counts. Infectious is the key word. The classic pop of \\"We were Rock n Roll\\" absolutely defies you to sit still. The joy de vivre of tracks such as the summer fun of \\"It's code\\" demands a compulsory smile with Monae often sounding like the young Michael Jackson. Things slow nicely on the eerie ballad \\"Look into my eyes\\", while on \\"Victory\\" she shows what an impeccable soul talent she is with the best vocal on the album. One small negative are the DJ interludes spaced throughout the album, which you will either love or press fast forward in high irritation. Other standouts include the smooth Latin rhythms of \\"Dorothy Dandridge Eyes\\" a song dedicated to, the first African-American actress to be nominated for an Oscar and the bright almost Stevie Wonder inflected ballad \\"Sally Ride\\" charting the first American woman to travel in space. The album is rounded off with the bright \\"What an experience\\" infused with reggae beats and a melody to die for.<br /><br />\\"The Electric Lady\\" is sheer invention writ large. This is smart intelligent music from an artist entering her stride and picking up the pace. She is now one of the most audacious singer songwriters with a foot in the mainstream but with enough ambition to dominate the planet. One of the songs on the album \\"Ghetto Woman\\" is dedicated to her mother and we should thank Mrs Monae Sr for sharing her daughters huge talent with us. \\"The Electric Lady\\" like its predecessor has a couple of quirks which could have been ironed out, but perhaps it is these small blemishes on a near perfect beast that makes this album so on the money.ht \\"What an experience\\" infused with reggae beats and a melody to die for.<br /><br />\\"The Electric Lady\\" is sheer invention writ large.

B0063IH60K|4.0|This game is an easy, fun game to pass time. I'm glad that the graphics and the animation is up to date. Would definitely recommend it since it's a free version.
B00942Y4IY|3.0|Predictable....fair action.  I would have liked to see how Slater adapted to the society after the others had exited through the Stargate!
B0095P31L6|3.0|Saw it in theatres and liked it. Some parts in the story line were slow, but the whole idea/plot was interesting. I found Johnny Depp playing the character Rango wasn't too enticing for this particular film, but it's a good film for kids.
B0094K1WZE|5.0|Plenty of well thought out and executed action.  Leaves one wanting at least one more mission wherein Tom Cruise and his wife are reunited (but only after some impossible obstacles are faced and alleviated.
B005HSL626|2.0|I downloaded this game thinking it was the same as the version that's on my phone, but turns out the Kindle version isn't up to date. It doesn't really register the finger movements sometimes and lags. Sometimes you're unable to even slice the fruit because of the delays. It'd be better if they updated the Kindle version to where it doesn't have the finger movement problems.
B00CRWJ7VC|1.0|I love Tom Hanks' films.  I could appreciate the actor's skills that he demonstrated in the movie Cast Away, even though I thought it to be a narcissistic movie for Tom.  That said, this movie made me feel even more that 'it's all about Tom Hanks.'  Within the first 45 minutes, Tom Hanks has played 4 different people.  The movie basically jumps from one agnostic scene to another in which Tom Hanks is playing a different character.  Supposedly, there is a 'special' mark that Halle Berry's character dons that is significant in some way.  However, by minute 47, when the film just starts to bring attention to this mark, I lost interest and went to clean my bathrooms and take out the trash.  Horrible waste of 47 minutes.  1 out of 5.
B00CDV6WDS|4.0|Great game. Great graphics. A wide assortment of different designs to play tiles. A great game to pass the time. Would recommend to those that like the real version but not the mess of the tiles.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|I'm a Linkin Park fan and came across Lindsey Stirling thanks to Pandora radio.  I hope Lindsey does a track with Linkin Park; their sounds would mix well.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I  usually don't care for Stephen King but this book is an exception. Fascinating from a historical perspective as well as a great personal story.
B005TBN3EU|2.0|Zach G.'s character is at it again, slipping roofies to his friends causing them to have a wild and crazy time.  The only differences between Hangover part 2 and part 1 is the fact that 1)roofies were put in the crew's marshmellows instead of their drinks, 2)their adventures took place in the red light district of Bangkok, China, and 3)we saw it all before.  Don't waste your time & money, just watch the original one again. 2 out of 5.
B0094M4R3Q|5.0|I watched this movie with my daughter when she was young, and am now enjoying with my grandaughter! IT is a favorite in our family.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This app id outstanding!  Do not be afraid to download this app  It works every time  you will love it
B00CO4KGYA|5.0|Smooth transaction from beginning to end.  I quickly received exactly what I needed to order and it was in great condition.
B006OAB2WK|5.0|Well made. Mailed promptly. The artwork on the insert is similar to the outside and just as nice. A fine item.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I RECENTLY PURCHASED A KINDLE FIRE AND I'M QUITE PLEASE WITH IT. YET THE ADDITION PRO 7 HAS MADE MY KINDLE A  COMPETE TABLET WITH ALL THE NECESSARY TOOLS.
B005J2UM9S|5.0|It starts out as a funny parody of the series, Ghost Adventures, but it quickly descends into a world caught somewhere between The Twilight Zone and Night Gallery.<br /><br />There's some smart twists, well done effects, acting is okay, pacing too, they really throw everything at you.  Young director, young writers, part 2 is worth watching, just skip the first 22 minutes or so... in part 2 I mean.  I hope part 3 is coming, I spoke to the director who told me the story is created to be a trilogy.
B0055D3EFU|5.0|I do not remember this movie playing in theaters, but once I was told about it I could not wait to rent it from Redbox.  I'm looking forward to 'Insidious 2' movie especially since it picks up where the first movie left off.
B00BMCAM6M|5.0|tons of genres to choose from and if you don't like a song currently playing, you can skip to the next one. i like that
B009VMN3RA|4.0|Overall, I thought this book was interesting, and I believe what the author wrote is mostly true.  Some of the details concerning Parker's love life could have been kept to herself, but it was a good read.  I always knew that S. MacLaine was out there but not to the extent to which the author describes.
B006VFLIYK|3.0|The book was very transparent from the start.<br /><br />The fact that his research staff did not bother to research the weapons used by Will was extremely evident.  Come on guys!
B004FEFS5E|5.0|Excellent tool,, really helped me to break the auto mode crutch and better understand how and why manual mode is so much more creative. Thanks Bryan
B007M45PMU|5.0|Really great album, pretty folksy so if you only like their hit song I probably wouldn't recommend their entire album
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Superb, my daughter of 4 years - old loves it, and has helped her to concentrate and manipulate small things in the tablet.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Excellent bingo game. By far my favorite of all. Love the 5 free tournament games daily and highly recommend.<br /><br />Lots of great rooms and collections.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Great site with such a variety. Everything you could ever need is broken down and the ease of saving the things you want to refer back to later.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved all three, but i think this one was the best! I can't wait for the movie! Couldn't put the book down.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing!! This being the final book, has an incredible finale!! You'll never be able to guess all the things that happen at the end of the trilogy. LOVED IT!!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I really like Evermore.  I don't take the time to review apps... but this one was worth the time.  it is a powerhouse app and its free.  I really appreciate that it backs up online so even if I change devices,bi just have to reinstall the app and loving and I have all my stuff.  A+
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book starts off slowly, the first 9 chapter are not good, whatsoever. But then, when you get to chapter 10, the story gets really good and exciting!! Guaranteed you'll love it!!
B00ECU2SGS|4.0|A decent movie with pretty good acting, the plot was a little to be desired but it is definitely worth watching.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This is an awesome game! I suggest it to people who like racing games and challenge games. There are various levels and stages and increasingly get more difficult to complete.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|Great game I recommend it. Really fun and easy to learn great for all ages and is kinda easy but challenging
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is simple, yet gives you real challenges. It doesn't get old! Great for kids AND adults! Lots of fun!
0817439390|5.0|This is a great book if your learning about exposure! It's simple to follow and breaks it down for everyone to understand.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Fantastic!!!!!!....cant wait to start Xenocide! What an amazing storyteller...he captured with his words and enthralled with his imagination...scifi at its best
B00634GHJA|2.0|Thought I would be able to transfer photos from my phone to my Kindle Fire, Didn't work for me or maybe I just didn't understand how to use the app.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|Easy to use without damaging the screen. Light weight and therefore easy to carry with me, all in all just what I needed .
B00000K2UX|4.0|classic soundtrack.  The last one died a slow and painful death, and needed to be replaced. I loved the fact that I was able to download it directly to my computer before the CD arrived.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Does a good job as an alarm clock on Kindle Fire. I have not overslept yet. No problems or crashes.
B005EWDA9M|4.0|I liked the characters, it is a very exciting book to the end and as it was situated in Tokio I have enjoyed the place too (I spent<br />a month in Japan several years ago).
0399159347|4.0|Characters are placed in difficult positions over and over again. It's and ntricate story, thought provoking, painful. What would you do?
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|If Google can update this to stream any player on any device's, then this product would be unmatched.  Right now it's pretty much limited to netflix, youtube and a few of other online video streaming sites.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Yes, it does seem to borrow from almost every known fantasy book ever published, but it mixes it into an enjoyable new world. Good escape from the &#34;real world&#34;. The characters are fun, and the story is gripping.
B008469DGY|5.0|I love this game. yeah some of the points seem next to impossible to get but this game is so hard to put down.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|This movie is so perfect in every way I can not wright about it to give it justice. This is truly an important film.  The Cinema Art Form at its' best.  Story telling at its' best.  Visual effects stunning and top draw.  Need I go on?  Buy it!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I love it.. it makes you think of life in a whole new perspective..  to live and the many challenges to overcome!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I want to have tea with Ian McKellen, KBE.  The reason I say that it's better the second time is because in part of Bilbo Baggins. Martin Freeman's performance is like a new pair of shoes that after time become your favorite. I must say I was not comfortable at first with him as Bilbo.  Such large epics, now I see a extended version is on the way, have so much going on you have to see it more than once to appreciate all the details.  This is true with Mr. Freeman's performance. I now totally appreciate him as the younger Bilbo.  Thank you Mr. Jackson for another adventure.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Nuff said. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; except head. Jolly green giant has huge clock. A big black one. Girl you mom. Stop touching me
B00C7JG0KG|3.0|Looks great.  I have become a big 3d fan.  This is visually stunning, just miscast or misdirect Mr. Franco.  All in all a good addition to my 3d collection
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun to play with options as to how many decks you want to use.  Be very careful if you get this app...it is addictive...LOL
B007V2UGPE|1.0|I had taken this game and downloaded it and then once I tryed to play it it'll just get. me to credits and physically shut down on me. this is a stupid game. why did I even get this.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Once again a superb series from the BBC via PBS.  While it is difficult to summon up much sympathy for the &#34;ruling class&#34; in this series, the acting and writing from the producers of this series is outstanding and the the viewer is drawn into the lives and struggles of the characters in the series.
B000SW2F8K|5.0|2013-09-10
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Great alarm clock at a great price! Very easy to use. Would recommend. I use mine daily to remind me of everything!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found it a little hard to follow what was real and true. Not the ending I expected. However, I would recommend reading it. It's relevant to living in today's world.
B00DBISUWS|5.0|Tales of Us, the new Goldfrapp album which took almost two years to put together is meant to be heard as a whole.  It is a beautiful and haunting collection of music that transports one to a different time/place/space.  Reminiscent of their first album \\"Felt Mountain\\" along with their 2008 release, \\"Seventh Tree,\\" Goldfrapp strips this new collection of their popular electronic sound and takes us on an emotional journey.  Other standout tracks on this album include \\"Jo\\" and \\"Annabel\\" which they just released a breathtaking video to go along with.  They also have a video for \\"Drew.\\"  There was some confusion that \\"Drew\\" was going to be made available as a single for sale prior to the album launch but Goldfrapp confirmed that this track was not going to be released separately as a single.  I'm personally not sure if any of the tracks that have videos would make for good single releases but nonetheless both are beautiful tracks and the videos are highly recommended as well.  The only song that has a beat reminiscent of Goldfrapp's dancier electro efforts is, my personal favorite track on the album, \\"Thea.\\"  If they plan on releasing an official single in the US with remixes and the works, this would be my pick.<br /><br />In a recent interview I read with Alison Goldrapp, she discussed how each song is the story of mostly a female character except for \\"Alvar\\" and \\"Clay\\" which are tracks inspired by the male experience.  \\"Clay\\" was inspired by a love letter, Alison read online somewhere, that was written by a soldier to another soldier and \\"Alvar\\" was inspired by european cinema, noir, Iceland and myths and legends of Philomena Lee.<br /><br />Ultimately, this is the type of music you listen to at an art exhibit or possibly with the lights off at home.  I promise you will feel transported.  There are no songs to twerk to, not really any pop radio singles, though it would be absolutely refreshing to hear something like this on radio.  Give this album a chance and you will not regret it.l not regret it.
B00DBISUN2|5.0|I have spun this vinyl from beginning to end twice already and I love the feel.  Haunting vocals, beautiful instrumentation, and an awesome use of strings.  Those of you who know who John Barry is, will appreciate some of the tracks.  This is not like any Goldfrapp album you've heard before and that's an awesome thing.  Embrace it and appreciate the new sound they have given us.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Beautifully written, fresh story concept, magical in every sense of the word.  The blending of characters and story lines is masterful.  Highly recommend this book.
B00BAXTYCQ|5.0|Constantly being listed as one of the worst Star Trek films ever made, this movie could hardly be better. It embodies a perfect Star Trek story: a morality tale with an engaging dilemma, a cast of great chracters with a carefully cultivated, almost perfect chemistry, fantastic pacing and timing, great humor and photography, a beautiful score and a great message. It is the perfect follow-up to the SciFi horror actioner First Contact and clearly superior to both the overly constructed Generations and the somewhat underwhelming, sterile Nemesis. I believe this picture to be both a classic and the late Michael Piller's masterpiece, something which all the people involved with the teenage BS J.J. Abrams is serving nowadays should take a hard look at!
B00E0MCYPS|5.0|This game takes me back to sega rally games some time ago. Its got the same sort of feel to it. Simple and straightforward gameplay. graphics not bad at all. Loading times are quick. Very happy with it.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|This book was a good follow up for Delirium. The ending made me die to read the finale! Unfortunately, the third and final book, Requiem, was slightly disappointing :(
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|This is the first mouse I ever actually purchased so I don't have much to compare it to other then my own expectations. My main concern when looking for a mouse was finding one big enough for me. To my knowledge this is on of the biggest mice out there (although don't quote me on that). When I got it I was very pleased to find that it fit my hand perfectly. The ergonomics are amazing and comfortable. For the first day or two it was a bit difficult to play games with it simply because I wasn't used to it. Three days later I was used to it and it's now my favorite part of my computer setup. Now to talk about some of the features. Obviously the Anker logo is the only light you can change. But it is pretty customizable, you can change the color the breathing rate and the brightness. The macro buttons are nice to have, although I use them more for productivity rather then gaming, but that's up to the user. Something I didn't see myself using was the dpi switch (and just in case you're wondering you can change these buttons to whatever key's you want) however I ended up really liking the different dpi profiles, and I'm glad they're there. The mouse comes with 8 weights to customize the weight of the mouse. They aren't very heavy so it's not going to be a massive difference but it is noticeable and it's nice to have them. The best part about this mouse is the price. It's 39.99 at the time of writing this and it is more then worth that with all the features and the premium feel. Although when I say premium feel that's compared to my own expectations. All in all I highly recommend this mouse and I'm very glad to have bought this one.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I did escape, but it was tough. I ALMOST gave up, but this was the most challenging game I have played in a long, long time!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is very addictive. A very good hidden object game.  It is easy too play for hours without spending money once you figure out the game.
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|Other than having the angels, heaven, and God be a little closer to my interpretation, there isn't a whole lot I would change!
B0055D3EFU|4.0|I usually don't get scared by scary movies but this scared me a bit but also was a thriller and that's what makes it a good movie, most scary movies are stupid and made poorly, not this one.
B009O2XY12|4.0|I love this game and am addicted to waiting for my energy level goes back up each day to play it again.  I'm unhappy that the energy only powers to 5 per day max.
B00A5FPQBI|5.0|This is the best Caribbean gangster movie!  Hands down.  I watch this movie all the time.  It will continue to never get old.
B00AW57L96|4.0|This book did not pan out the way I expected but it was most interesting and a timely reminder that not all Pandora's boxes are meant to be opened. Oh, and don't leave random notes around ...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Luv it.  Highly recommended.  Each time I re-read it (have read all of them about 4x already) I find more I missed.  One of the best books I've ever read, and continue to re-read.  Enjoy!
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|The production qualities to this movie are just as good as Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy: the cinematography is great; the scenery is breathtaking; the action is good; the CGI sequences are top notch.<br /><br />The problem for me is that everything is shot like LOTR. I mean, exactly. Every single part of this movie feels exactly the same as all the LOTR movies, especially the Return of the King. Even the music is exactly the same.<br /><br />Sure, it's great to have continuity, but this film has no character of its own. After the LOTR trilogy, it's just tiring and overdone.<br /><br />Will I see the next installment? Sure, I love Tolkien and the world he created, and I'll want to watch how it's brought to life on screen. But, I'm not exactly looking forward to it, after watching this movie. I'd say, I feel it's almost more of a duty to watch the rest of this movie as it comes out.
B0041D843M|5.0|This should be required reading for everyone. Put it on the reading list in High School or college or better yet, both. Every doctor should give a copy to his/her patients. An absolute must read.
B000I0XLYO|2.0|but the actors gave it their best.<br />if this is supposed to be a spoof of the modeling world, it succeeds at times
B009FZHYKU|5.0|While I personally could do without the gore factor, this is a well written and incredibly well acted show.  Storyline draws you in and makes you care about the characters.  I've caught up on all three seasons in short order.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I have played a lot of the games from BIG FISH GAMES and I love them all. This is another great game. It's worth the time and money. I am unlocking the full version tonight. Great graphics, scenario, everything I love playing. Must get this one, you will be hooked!!!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|There is significant lag time between pausing it on your phone/laptop and the TV pausing. That is when it's working, sometimes the pause/play/stop buttons don't work at all and I would have to force close the Netflix app then go back into it.<br /><br />Another down side is it doesn't play any Amazon Instant Prime videos. I knew ahead of time it would only play videos from Netflix and YouTube when using my phone, but I thought it would play Amazon prime videos when I stream them using the Google chrome browser on my laptop. Sadly, it does not.<br /><br />I'm sure they will have more apps in the future but right now it's just not really as good as I had hoped it would be.
B00005JPD0|5.0|Denzel Washington, Val Kilmer and the stunningly delightful Paula Patton lead you on a heart stopping adventure with a lovely twist in the tail.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I would watch this movie every day if I could! Cannot wait for the sequel to come out!! Hopefully its just as good!
B00471TLZS|5.0|This movie spawned a generation of Ghost hunters.  It was scary and spooky and is now scaring my children!  Excellent!
B005LAIISA|5.0|My son love everything ICE AGE! This xmas he got all 4 movies and he watches them all the time!!! Well done Ice age!
B000RUAR5G|1.0|Too much nonsense even for looney tunes. The cartoon charcter voices  were uncomfortably off in tone and pace as well.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I loved this book! I thought the plot, with all the twists, was true to life and thought provoking. I felt the portrayal of the characters allowed the reader to really get inside their heads. Extremely well written, couldn't put it down and thought the plot was original with a satisfying ending.
0060775858|5.0|This book is over 50 years old.  My children (now in their late 50's) loved it, which is why I ordered a copy for my great grandson, Julian West.  He's still too little to enjoy it (he's just one yr old), but I know he'll love it in turn.
1451626096|2.0|Phillipa Gregory is my favorite author, and as usual I was anticipating reading this book, but sadly disappointed. It lacked the usual page turning suspense she is known for. It was to repetitive and quite boring. Usually I am reading til the wee hours of the morning,but found myself bored and not even sure if I wanted to finish reading it.
B00BCZU8WM|4.0|The cd is a very good one and I got for only one song the rest of is is just a bit to young for me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book was so hard for me to put down. It's been a long time since I enjoyed a book this much. Hugh Howey -- thank you and I'll be looking for more of your work!
B00144VBBS|4.0|TOBY KEITH-35 BIGGEST HITS: The double dippin' anthology 35 BIGGEST HITS is roughly divided into the two phases of KEITH's lengthy career...his moderately successful nineties stint as a straight country singer of mellow gems like the warmly nostalgic SHOULDA BEEN A COWBOY...and the new millennium era KEITH, who morphed into a redneck rockin' good ol' boy prone to political statements such as COURTESY OF THE RED, WHITE & BLUE and rowdy drinkin' ditties like I LOVE THIS BAR and GET DRUNK AND BE SOMEBODY. Whichever TOBY trips your trigger, most of his best loved biggies, from the melancholy HE AIN'T WORTH MISSIN' to the WILLIE NELSON assisted BEER FOR MY HORSES are unfurled in blessed chronological order, the better to witness his evolution from casual chart maker to bona fide superstar. A macho sense of humor, always a welcome country music trademark, shines through loud and clear in his earliest &#34;roadhouse&#34; hit YOU AIN'T MUCH FUN (SINCE I QUITE DRINKIN') as well as later singles I WANNA TALK ABOUT ME, STAYS IN MEXICO and AS GOOD AS I ONCE WAS. As this generous collection proudly affirms, TOBY KEITH's just about as good as he's ever been.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR PULL TOPS
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is pretty cool. Gives me something to do in my spare time. Only wish thing were cheaper to buy in the game.
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I like the characters--very middle class and homespun.  Real.  Brilliant acting.<br />And it was not too slow.  I like it so far.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|i love this game!!! it is amazing and stratic and you really have to use your head! love it you must get this app!!!!!
B009S33I68|5.0|I have seen the movie and its one of my favs. I am currently reading the book and i love the story of a leader that gives so much for the mission and the way that the troopers interacted.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|How can you not love the show that brought us the first flip phone, Skype, Blue Tooth and large flat screen televisions.
B000IZ6URY|5.0|I simply love this movie. It's so irreverent and inappropriate and it just makes for one of the funniest movies I've ever seen and still quote to this day. I remember initially seeing the director's cut or something and the puppet sex scene was crazy. But I had to get this on DVD for when I'm in the mood for a funny, unapologetically crude comedy. With puppets.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Had to get this movie for my daughter .. she has read the books and loves the movie as well. Love to watch it with her again and again.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Mr. Crouch has done it again! Wow, what a masterful piece of art. This guy can write. He had me right away, held on tight, and then didn't let go until he was ready. Crazy good! Seriously, read this novel. I loved it. Now, off to read the next Crouch masterpiece.
B000FP2OPY|2.0|I received  this product used and it is probably the worst condition used product I've ever purchased. The first disc won't play the last two episodes and the second disc won't play AT ALL. The condition said &#34;Good&#34; but I found this to not be true. I'm going to attempt to take them to my local Family Video and get them cleaned and HOPE they work. I'm kind of upset about this as it was a planned event to have a Supernatural marathon tonight and it was ruined due to the owners abuse of the discs.
B00DW36G32|3.0|Very suspenseful, story line was entertaining but then the end comes. The screen goes black with credits and you scratch your head because it all ended so suddenly. Your left thinking that was it? Had the ending been better this would have been a 4 star movie.
B00DNDR29I|5.0|heads up, the album is amazing, but the target exclusive version is the way to go on this album for many reasons<br />1. it includes 4 extra tracks, 2 are remixes and then 2 are new songs, the final track is a cover of the jackson 5 song I want you back<br />2. they break up the 4th and 5th overtures by putting them each on their own cd's<br />3. this week the album is the same price as you would find on amazon, since it's 11.99 and then on cartwheel from target you get another 10% off the target version<br /><br />for me i actually prefer the 2 cd's since i think the overtures broken up work better
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Solid gameplay with challenging but far from difficult puzzles. I admit I was tempted to look up a walkthrough once... And then I realized that in some rooms you can turn around which let me find the pieces of the puzzle I was missing. All around fun and a very good example of the genre of room escape games. I especially liked how well the color patterns were hidden throughout the rooms, usually in pretty natural ways. I heartily recommend the game.
B000A0K2JO|5.0|Does what an adapter suppose to do from USB to PS2. If you need an adapter than, it is always good to have one just in case.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|I love watching anything with Bruce Willis in it . The movie was decent with quite a bit of action
B000VNMMQG|5.0|about a horrible time in history and the people who decided that yes they could make a difference, in spite of overwhelming odds and sickness.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book lived up to all of the reviews everyone has posted.  I haven't read too many pleasure books of late as I was working on my master's course.  My wife recommended that I start reading again for pleasure and this was my first choice.  This is one outstanding book and I am hooked.  Must read if your into fantasy books.  Can't wait to start the next book!!
B00AFEXRME|1.0|The main character of the film is so vile, self centered, promiscuous, foul mouthed,drugged up  and drunk, that you dont care that he is a hero at all, you have no sympathy for him as he goes around begging for people to lie to save his job, 6 people died and he was pouring vodka into orange juice as he flew the plane. he had no concern for his passengers, just himself.<br />I couldnt even finish watching the movie, i threw it in the trash.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Love this show, and it stays good through all the seasons I've seen so far. The overall plot line hangs together and each episode does too. Walter Bishop character is absolutely wonderful and makes me laugh in every episode.
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Great commercial and preview but too cartoonist in film production.  I think they tried to save the money by not making the real scene in this movie. They digitized half of the scene in the the movie.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This film should be dedicated to all of the singers and musicians who play in obscurity because they love what they do. Part detective story, part inspiration, the film reminds us that there are those among us who do not change when fame arrives. It is simply acknowledged humbly with a grateful smile as Rodriguez remains who he has always been.
B006LSZECO|4.0|You keep turning the pages because you want to know what is happening, why it's happening and who is really the crazy one. The ending, I'm still trying to decide if I like it or not.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|This is a book I re-read every ten years or so - beginning in 1950.  It is unique in literature.  No other story of the Alaska gold rush or any dog story comes close  - or at least that is my opinion.
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|Though it's not easy to watch at times, you are drawn into their character and can't help but hope all works out for them.
B000MVN8GK|5.0|I had never watched this show before and came across it. I was so sad to find out that after season three, the show got canceled. To make matters worse, season 3 ended with a huge cliffhanger. It was a great show and worth keeping.
B00CMIK9D6|5.0|This guy is amazing, but buy the deluxe download version with extra Remix Tracks. His voice reminds me of Jacques Brel with a hip-hop electro vibe.<br />Just think what it would be like if they took Jacques Brel's famous tracks and remix them. now there's a great idea
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|Raw and powerful. Real life at the highs and lows. Great life and business advice also. Highly recommend and have done so.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|So fun to watch. Also all type of pregnancies are correct. They followed Heidi's book which is a Bible for pregnant women.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Super Great story. You never saw the ending coming or even have an inkling of all the twists and turns.....fabulous
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Great read!  Finally a book with a strong female as well as a strong male.  Lots of twists and turns.
B00DWZHTOU|1.0|I signed up to review movies specifically to give this a low review. It's so bad. Horrible script. Did they wrote it in 24 hours?
B000QI2ZWW|4.0|Lots of fun!  Makes me smile!  Great entertainment for all ages with a message for ecology; especially great for youngsters..
B004UID2LC|5.0|Does what is says it will do on my galaxy note 2. I wish that i could specify where I can sore the video though, like my ds card
B00CATSONE|4.0|A quick read, this book shows how with hard work, practice & study/preparation, almost anyone with a reasonably high intelligence can be a \\"genius\\" in some area: sports, the arts, engineering - you name it! Imagination & work  are the key ingredients to success in most endeavours. Its like seeing opportunity where most see nothing or worse, problems.<br /><br />While rather simplistic, it does tell what it takes to be an Elizabeth the 1st, a Telsa, a Micheal Jordan or a future Nobel Prize winner.
B002YCVX5S|4.0|Wow. Wow. Wow. He's done it again. Talk about an intense ride. The actors are did a great job. I love the fluidity between languages. Brilliant.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I like the versatility of having all three formats. This kind of package makes for a great gift. Like usual, the brooding, tough as nails Bond as portrayed by Daniel Craig is my favorite.<br />I had a couple of &#34;What? Come on man&#34; moments in this movie but overall, I like the acting and of course, the action. I think the character play between Bond and the rest is really good, especially Moneypenny. My favorite line in the movie is when Mallory tells James not to screw it up. (uses a different word) It's probably the best motivational line one could ever give to James Bond. lol
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love them and my husband loved when I was reading the series. Nice way to jump start a spark again.
B005LAIIA8|5.0|I'm not big on telling stories so so hear is my side of the movie<br /> I really love this story line about a boy and the love he had for his<br />dog a mans best friend well this dog die. well it starts of<br />with the boy in school and had to do a science project. his teacher was<br />telling the class how elect works. And we use elec to make things move even<br />wake things up. like life. now I will leave it up to you. one of my best<br />movies . a family movie. I do want to say it is in black and white but it<br />all made since. { BUY THIS MOVIE. }I HAVE IT IN 3D  REVIEW BY DEN SR.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I was looking forward to another great book by this author as I read his other two novels; this one just didn't &#34;grab&#34; me as the other ones did.
1444737112|5.0|For anyone who loves and understand animals this is a must.  The story of a recovering person is heart warming and should touch almost everyone as the problems are universal.
B00ENTDDGW|5.0|Hi glow hockey is a fun game for everyone.  I especially like the colors and background sounds.I would recommend it
B006AZZPCM|3.0|This application is annoying the hell out of me not to mention the are a lot  of porn ads!!!?  Smh
B009Z5BPZK|5.0|Got shipped a day earlier ! it was my first order here in the US ! I loved it ! it was a gift for my girlfriend and she loved it ! Perfect and Perfect !
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so cool I love it there's always new things to discover every time you play I would recommend this game to any one
B0094K1MH2|5.0|If you look around the internet about this movie you'll come across comparisons to Indiana Jones - it's an apt comparison. And just as fun! Improbable feats of skill and calculation, danger, pathos, etc. And the graphic rendition of it all allows camera angles and running shots that add to the thrill. Yay!
B0083Z614S|3.0|A young girl brought back from India and trying to live with an old wealthy relative who was away most of the times and there was a child hidden away - this discovery was made by this young girl by chance as was the 'garden'...eventually the two of them with the help of the brother of the maid, converted an abandoned garden into a lively place and the 'hidden' child (young boy actually) surprises his father that he is not an invalid.as was thought - a simple story - easy reading.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|Enjoyable as your mind learns to sort and match. The best of four Mahjong games I've tried. Good luck. Bye
B00CTGVKGQ|5.0|Absolutely love Lorde, so glad to have a hard copy of this EP. Not on a song it that I don't love!
B00785P2QC|5.0|Completely addictive and amazing very fast paced yet full of content would highly recommend love the detailed graphics yet never slows down if you love any Sims game you'll love this
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This cable is great.  It works more than fine.  It fulfill my expectative and I am happy with it.  Thank you.
1250039037|5.0|I couldn't stop reading. The writing style is so fluid it will trap you. Waiting for the next (and hopefully) the last one of this story
B00CPTUNBK|5.0|Absolutely love this movie.  Definitely worth every penny.  My daughter loves it too.  Very cute and uplifting.  Has fantastic  songs too.  She dances to it and everything.  Even my nephews love it.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|This movie was...well, moving. Great acting and an equally great plot. It won't satisfy if you need a shoot 'em up, bang, bang experience, but if you're wanting a classic story of human value, you'll like it too.
B005CRQ2XA|5.0|This book is very awesome and funny and you  should give this book a five star rating it is awesome.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Does getting what we desire result in havoc? Interesting &#34;myth&#34; that mixes physics (an ocean that fits in a bucket and alternative dimensions) with memory and  the scarey issues of childhood.  Gaiman can write and not just books for the young. Readers who like to puzzle over the universe, its unknown, and humanity are going to enjoy this one. Occasional tangents are cause for wondering; still the story hangs together well and definitely satisfies.
1596434252|5.0|My wife and I are fans of pop-up books. This is the most inventive pop -up alphabest book we have ever seen. Nearly every page demonstrates a new way to show one, two or even three letters in sequence. This is an &#34;adult book&#34; not because of salicious material but because the sophistication of the presentation is beyond the level that young children can appreciate. Our adult friends love it.
B005MLP71Y|4.0|I think I enjoyed it more than my kids. For them. Dragged in the middle. Hadd their attn in beginning and end, though.
B006IGZX0C|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the story of human beings living lives through their fear of being shunned by their peers, and of those few among us who have the courage to do the RIGHT thing in the face of enormous pressure to conform to the pressure of our friends, family and neighbors. As a story about people treating each other as just that--people, who also have hopes, wishes, dreams, fear, pain, and suffering--this has found a place among my list of classics.<br /><br />We are NOT all born equal (I will NEVER be an NBA player, nor a prima ballerina--I simply don't have the height or the body type). We ARE, however, all born with the RIGHT to be TREATED EQUALLY--with respect, consideration, and as another human being--regardless of the color of our skin or any other such superficial factor. I recently read something that has struck a chord: We are not all born entitled to the same outcomes, but we ARE all born entitled to the same OPPORTUNITIES to prove our worth. The Help is a movie that develops its characters and uses them to illustrate this. And it does it VERY well, with lots of humor and heartbreak thrown in for good measure.
0345472322|4.0|While the author's style feels a little choppy and disjointed at times, the content is excellent. I have started using the concept of mindsets with my clients. I highly recommend this book for educators, administrators, therapists and parents.
B008Y6RFBE|5.0|this is my favorite movie.  what a great performance by Daniel Day Lewis!<br /><br />These are the other words I need to complete the review.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|love to play this gets harder as you go . see people playing it every where  some times the boards need more moves
B00DM0XXCM|4.0|I loved the different aspects of this. The title is spot on. It's like looking at black and white and trying to figure out who you can make it more gray. Two worlds really close to each other (black and white). Their gravity suits them unless they try to get onto each other's world. Two teenagers (one from each world) meet, fall for each other, something happens and they don't meet again until they are adults. Their goal is to be together but, they have an evil corporation with some prejudices and gravity issues to deal with.  Interesting ending that changes much. The main male character can sometimes be a little silly but then he's apparently in love so what do you expect? If I told you any more then this I'd really be spoiling it for you. Just be prepared for one side of your mind to be upside down.
B000PUV1ZI|5.0|We all loved this movie.  Great fun for the entire family.  I'd recommend it for anyone.  My 4 year old wasn't scared.
B000P407K4|2.0|Dr. Strangelove is certainly one of the strangest movies I've ever seen. The titular character only has about ten lines on dialogue in this surprisingly short film (especially for a Kubrick film), he sounds like a German Kermit the Frog, and he has next to no character develompent, and yet somehow had a disorder named after him. This isn't even to mention the terrible puns and allusions that make up the character names. Jack D Ripper, Bat Guano, King Kong, even Strangelove.  Anyway, the best part of this movie is the end, for three reasons. It features an awe-inspiring montage of nuclear explosions, you get the satisfaction of knowing that the characters [SPOILER] all died, and the fact that the movie is over.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Once we read through all of Brown's detailed descriptions of architecture and other details of the setting, the story is an amazing  account of a secret society and its influence on American history and culture. I was riveted to my iPad from Page 1 to The End!
B000L53D4O|5.0|The kids I babysit love this toy.  It not only helped them learn to walk but they continue to play with it and push it around outside.  It was a good investment.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I have successfully done the first 3 exercises. It has been a fun and rewarding experience. I would highly recommend this book.
1401938906|5.0|One of the best &#34;how to&#34; books on the subject. Pam Grout has managed to keep it very real while giving clear, insightful and humorous tips on manifesting. I've read many books on the subject and I can honestly say this one has helped me more than any others in becoming aware of my thoughts, keeping it light, and actually seeing results! Her joyful spirit comes through loud and clear and I couldn't help feeling it as I read. The experiments she outlines are fun and worked very well. The key is to focus! Wonderful book!
B003R50FRI|4.0|Very absorbing story with excellent character depictions. Lots of twists and turns and brilliantly written. Provides a philosophical perspective of life and the universe in a wonderful setting by way of raw practical application.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I love all three Quell games, but this one is my favorite.  It's impossible to become bored because of  the new features constantly added to the various levels, starting with the narrative at the very beginning (a charming and provocative feature I've seen in no other game).  I'd recommend that those new to Quell begin with the original Quell game and &#34;graduate&#34; to Quell Memento, however, simply because I think one should master the basics in order to feel more comfortable with the variations introduced in Memento.  An excellent addition to any app collection.
B00B7Y0206|3.0|Very good quality on videos, ok video browsing. Crashes a couple of times. Sometimes I need to delete and reinstall. Very slow, even with high speed internet. You cannot access people's channels from their videos, which stinks. I'd mainly recommend for people who want to download videos or have an account.
B008HJGPVO|5.0|I love the fact that it has 3 ends of different sizes.  I had a game I couldn't play very well until I had the smaller tip, and they all are in 1 pen.  It is about the size of a regular pen so it is comfortable to hold.<br /><br />SQ
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Took a while to work out how to install but when finally installed - excellent<br /><br />I'm 64 so I guess the younger generation would have done it in minutes
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|As a Trek fan they have redone the episodes in a very smart way with good story lines and amazing effects.
B004LLDN3A|5.0|Mary Poppins is a wonderful movie for the family.  We loved the songs then (when it first came out) and we still know the words after all this time.  It is timeless in its imagination and its message.
B005TBN3EU|1.0|Very bad movie. Not even worth the 1.99 rental charge. Not sure why they would produce such a horrible flick.
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|I love the series and the special effects are great. The only problem that I have had is with the voice track.  Sometimes it gets off during the viewing of the episodes, but not all the time and not for the entire episode.  That can be distracting.  Other than that I am very satisfied with my purchase.
B009FRG8IW|4.0|If you are into edm or even just like the few songs from this album that have charted this album will hit the spot.  Great music and well worth the purchase - nothing disappoints on this album.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put the  book down. I was hooked from start to finish. Can't wait to read the next one.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Amazing Movie! I'm a huge fan of the wizard of oz. Very well planned out version of it. Highly recommend it.
B00E8B1358|1.0|Ever been in a meeting where someone asks for &#34;any ideas.&#34;  This movie incorporated every idea that was put on the table.  Sad for G.I .Joe
B0039TD7PY|4.0|didn't like the live part of the production.  after awhile you get tired of hearing the same chatter.  wonderful artists to listen to.
0062080237|4.0|I just finished reading \\"American Gods\\". It won the Hugo, the Nebula, and the Bram Stoker award, but I read it because it was number 10 on \\"NPR's Top 100 Science-Fiction & Fantasy Books\\" and because my buddy Sam Rushing recommended it.<br /><br />In short, I really, really liked it! I didn't think I would like it at all until about chapter 3, but after that, I couldn't put it down. It's like a mix of \\"O Brother Where art Thou\\", \\"The Guardians\\", Edgar Allan Poe, John Steinbeck, and \\"Pulp Fiction\\". My only complaint was that it was a bit too violent and sexually explicit for my tastes. Aside from that, it's a very enjoyable read!
B00006RAKP|4.0|great price for Elton's greatest hits.  very enjoyable.  good music to exercise to.  who doesn't know all the words to sing along?
0062278096|5.0|I enjoy the stories, great acting and scripts of these Sherlock Holmes stories.  I plan to enjoy them again and again.
B0083Z614S|5.0|What a delightful story of the strength of the human spirit! I wanted to jump with joy along with he kids! The descriptions of the garden and nature throughout he book were magnificent!
1401223176|5.0|This story arc renewed my interest in reading comics again after a 15 year layoff. The Hush villain is a fresh and fitting foe for Batman and a pleasant change from the recycled foes of the past.
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|Great documentary, never new about Sound City, but if you are a music fan, this is something to watch, you will be hooked.
0375869026|5.0|This precious little  book has a beautiful message for all readers---just be NICE. It also affirms teachers, parents, siblings, and friends of children with special needs. I've given it to some of my adult, former students because I saw their struggle in this child, and I wanted them to know they were not alone.
B00006IM9Q|5.0|Great album at a great price.  Nice to have a CD in the original diamond case with cover art along with the Amazon Cloud to play on computer or device.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|I went to the WWII museum in New Orleans, and saw mention of the fight on Peleliu.  I had never heard of it, so I grabbed this book when I accidentally ran across it.  It's the best description of what war is really like, on the front lines, not from your living room.  An amazing book!!!
B000000OF6|5.0|It is what it is at a great price.  I cannot ask for anything else than that.  I need three more words.  The Tide Is High...
B005XQLBU4|5.0|This game is actually pretty fun and addictive. I love games like this. It is kind of like tower defense and no one has to agree with me but this game is not so epic but very fun.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|This was a great trilogy with constant action.  Well defined characters carried the story line all the way through.  Book 2 was a bit slow and I got a little tired of the main characters' constant whining, but overall, I'm very glad I read it.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Great book... I was able to publish my book on Kindle without any difficulty... a must read if you are looking to publish your book on Kindle!
B003PBB4ME|4.0|I use this with my DSLR and its very helpful for getting those low shots. I'd recommend this to anyone that wants to get those great shots without emptying their wallet.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Wonderful account of both history and personal stories of love and relationships.  I highly recommend it for anyone who's a WWI buff.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I have used this bag for years with my DSLR and I can literally fit everything inside, had more than enough room for whatever you use to shoot.
B00B0HXC4I|5.0|In a world of copy cats, nice to hear and see an original act, they go for a horror rock theme and do it quite well
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|Dredd was pretty good def worth watching again it had a good mix of action and story line to the movie
B00CB4FHNI|5.0|These guys are quite unique, they have a retro style sound and sick lyrics.  Some compare them to Blue Oyster Cult mixed with Mercyful Fate
B00CY0JY88|5.0|Can't wait for number 4!!! My new favourite series... The characters are broken but together they are fixed. Plus I just totally love Cary! I'd share him any day!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|amassing idea and one of the finest finest game I ever played in my life time and it is so like temple run. subway suffers
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|It can be very hard to walk away from this game as it gets into your blood, or psyche or whatever. Nevertheless, I have found it a wonderful diversion from the woes of the real world around me every day. It seems to give a certain balance.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love this bingo game! Very addicting and and a lot of fun! You won't be able to put it down!
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Something different... Nice twist on the classic fairy tales we all know. Looking forward to season 3, starts Sept 29
B00BR476TG|4.0|doesn't spoil the movie and convinced my husband to watch it after he had been avoiding it for a year
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app is almost perfect, except that you CANNOT change the newsfeed to sort by &quot;most recent&quot; vs &quot;top stories&quot;. Yes the gear is next to news feed just like on the android version,but you cannot click the gear. It just sends you back to the newsfeed, unchanged. And the news feed keeps reverting to &quot;top stories&quot;. VERY annoying.

B00DBSZJRM|3.0|did not care for this movie. to much foul language and some nudity in it. Would not recommend for children or a family movie. :(
B008469DGY|5.0|To me this is the best flick game yet. The graphics are great and reaction to flick for ball spin is perfect.<br />I haven't had any issues with the app hanging or freezing my Kindle Fire.<br />The courses are just hard enough to keep it fun and interesting. Don't expect to hole in one very often but, it is possible.
B005HEPS6A|4.0|I enjoyed  3 season very much.  Well written, good characters and story line.  It is a pleasure to watch a show with a  language that is not an embarrssment.
159420411X|5.0|Removes the noise. Just the logic.  The perfect read for a political junky who loves math.  Hope 2016 is just as good

B0015DYIH2|5.0|There are so few books that I ever want to read again after I've read them one time.  In the last five years I've read this book 3 times.  I am a 32 year old mother of two.  I am happily married.  This series speaks to my soul.
B00DPKQ60A|5.0|I was shocked at how good this album actually is.I was expecting a mediocre debut album,but as I listened to it,each song i fell more in love with.Its a very mature album,and her voice is gorgeous.

B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love this book because  the best way to understand English language through this book.I dedicate this book to Mrs Brown Jefferson.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Amid a slew of bestsellers about murder and depravity, this book was an absolute pleasure.  From the first page to the last, it was well-written and, ultimately, life-affirming without smudging or glossing over the inevitable ugly details of real life.  Every character remains likeable in spite of their flaws.  I felt fresh all over instead of having to shower (figuratively) after some books i've read lately!  I can't wait until her next book comes out.  I only wish Rachel Joyce wasn't a new writer!  I don't want to wait.  Three cheers for this book.
B003WUYRGI|5.0|I like this book , becus the English is good, and understandable and unique.\\"thank u\\".I dedicate this book to Mr.Jefferson

B003JTHWJQ|2.0|I actually liked reading this book and wanted to rate it higher.  I decided to rate it lower because the reason I liked it was the opposite what the book's purpose was.  After reading it,  I'm even more convinced that God exists and the bible is true.  Dawkin's main argument in this book is what he calls the Ultimate 747 argument which is that the universe is so complex and improbable that any god that would have created it would be even more complex and improbable and we should therefore rule it out.  It seems to me this argument commits the fallacy of begging the question.  The premise of this argument is naturalism, which is that only a natural process can generate complexity out of simplicity.  Since it's assumed that since the universe and and everything in it (including God according to Dawkins), starts out simple and gets more complex later through a long, gradual process,  a god developing in this fashion would be vastly improbable.  Obviously, no creationist will ever accept that argument.  Dawkins misrepresents Darwinian evolution by stating several places that it depends only on Natural Selection, and not on chance.  However, even Darwin realized that without random chance variations, natural selection can do nothing.  He also misrepresents Intelligent Design, but stating that it's argument is based solely on improbability.  One only needs to look at the Explanatory Filter to see that this is completely wrong.  He displays a childish disdain for Michael Behe, by calling him a creationist (which he isn't).  He displays a very superficial knowledge of the bible in his critique of the argument from scripture.  After Dawkins makes his arguments about why he thinks God doesn't exist he then speculates on where religion and morality come from.  I didn't find anything in this book convincing, and the blatant misrepresentations did not help it's cause.
1423140605|5.0|I've always loved greek mythology and I absolutely love this book because of the &#34;can't put it down&#34; feeling I get whenever I read it.
147674355X|4.0|I liked the characters immensely. Felt at ease with them. It was easy to keep reading without stopping. The situations and the central relationship was more what I would expect for young people college age. Good dialogue. They seemed awfully young to have the wisdom and communications skills of 17-18 year olds as portrayed in the book. An enjoyable read. I would read this author's other books.
1423113462|5.0|True to Rick Riordan's books, this book was both exciting and hard to put down.  A must to read! You will love it.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|The best Sy-fy series ever made.  Watch season one and your hooked.  No commercials and you can watch anytime.  I love it.
1423141997|5.0|A wonderful, exciting book that keeps me on the edge of my seat.  Hard to put down. A must to read!
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|A nice change for a detective novel. A flawed detective with a lot of baggage - makes you want to find out if he self- destructs.  I would like to read the series in sequence but they don't seem to be available in translation.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great show. So glad I am an Amazon Prime member. Will be all caught up for Season 4.  Go Jean Smith
0316223239|5.0|This book has been acclaimed for its spellbinding voice -- the 5-year-old narrator Jack. The audio version is superbly performed by mutiple readers, and although the little boy's voice was off-putting to me at first, it soon became haunting. A wonderful, top-notch book that is one of my favorite audio books ever.
B000MD7OKY|5.0|You could replace diamonds with sheep, swap the riviera for monument valley, and the striped french sailor shirts for dusters and this would be a classic western. Its a story with good dramatic bones, and Grant and kelly flesh it out nicely.
B005Y8KWNS|5.0|It works nicely! I am so glad that the scanner is now on my phone. This has been a life-saver!
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I was a bit worried about doing everything &#34;all by myself&#34; - fear and trepidation ruled - and now I am self published! I would say that sums up how much of a confidence builder this book is -
B002ZG9774|5.0|I do not like this type of movie but my wife finally got me to watch it with her and I loved it, we also purchased the CD Version of this as well on Amazon. Both of them are fantastic singers and song writers, buy it you will not be disappointed !!!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|one third the cost of Apple TV with 1/20th of it's function. Could not get it into full screen mode. Come on Google, you can do better than this.
B00E3D7WGU|1.0|Update:<br /><br />Apparently Amazon makes no sense.<br /><br />After further inspection I see Amazon put all the Blu Ray reviews with<br />the CD-R ones on the CD-R web page. Also on the DVD web page.<br /><br />MDNA CD-R click here. Why are the Blu Ray reveiws here also AMAZON?<br />[[ASIN:B00E3D7WGU B00E3D7WGU]]<br /><br />Now why should the CD audio version be rated along with one star reviews on the defective Blu Ray<br />5.1 sound problem???<br /><br />AMAZON!<br /><br />What's up with this???<br /><br />------------------------<br /><br />Not a mistake? According to someone on an Amazon forum<br />it was a mistake that this is listed as a CD-R.<br /><br />No it is a CD-R! I checked mine thoroughly and thought<br />we may in in luck. Then I saw on the barcode. Manufactured<br />by Amazon.com ,kycd, Lexington , KY.<br /><br />------------<br />Update:<br /><br />I have revised my rating to 5 stars. Now that I find this was the only<br />format it was available in the USA I will accept it for now. I give it 5 stars<br />to balance out the one star reviews here on the Blu Ray sound. This is not<br />a Blu Ray! :-) Review it on it's own page.<br /><br />Half the negative reviews here are on the Blue Ray being<br />defective. They do not belong here or pertain to this product.THIS IS A CD NOT A BLUE RAY VIDEO!<br />AMAZON SHOULD REMOVE THEM IF THEY ARE RESPONSIBLE!
