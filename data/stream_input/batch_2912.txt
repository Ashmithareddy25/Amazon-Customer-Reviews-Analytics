B00CMYRSQG|5.0|Easily one of the best cds of the year, very creative and tasteful musically. I couldn't be happier with this purchase
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My whole family, from my four-year-old to my husband, loves this game!  It is entertaining and lots of fun.  Excellent job!
B008AK8FHM|3.0|Liked the first part of the book, found it interesting, but then it got a bit technical for my taste.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|First, let me begin by simply stating that this is a fantastic movie featuring a well-paced and authentic screenplay that takes advantages of the best audio and video production available.<br /><br />The movie features a new villain, new in the sense those who watch the first movie (2009) have not met him before as well as introduces a number of characters and races we know in ways that are believable and fun. While at times the movie is predictable, the film includes some twists and turns that keep you enjoying the entire ride. While some fan favorites may not feature as central a role as one would hope, the characters all play an important role in making this a believable environment. For those with families, this would probably be good for anyone 10-12 years old or older. The movie features some lingerie (well, \\"sexy\\" underwear) and a few instances of profanity (s word being the worst). Obviously whether this movie is appropriate would depend on your family, but my personal opinion would be as stated above.<br /><br />The audio in the movie is fantastic and features strong low frequency extensions (aka will make your subwoofer work) when ships go to warp and other events occur which I won't spoil for you. The highs are warm and vibrant and not shrill or harsh. The sound field envelopes you a few times in a full 360º experience for those with surround sound, with phasers firing, characters talking and action occurring on all sides. Overall, the Dolby HD track on the Blu-Ray would be considered a reference quality audio that is perfect to show off a home theater or to marvel at with your family. This is engaging and purposeful sound that truly transforms the experience.<br /><br />The video is sharp and crisp, in beautiful 1080p (Blu-Ray version) with saturated colors where appropriate. The film benefits from a larger screen as you can get more details and can truly appreciate the scale and work that was put into this, but any device will do. There is a little bit of film grain (the little speckles on the picture) which is really only noticeable if looking for it on the darker scenes and in some of the fog like effects. Throughout the film, the camera is very close to the characters, showing detail and color, but can get a bit much if the constant camera motion bothers you. CGI was well done, and never appeared \\"fake\\", all of it blended well and felt like part of the set. For some viewers, you may want to watch this at night, or in a room that you can control the light as the sunlight on the TV may wash out some of the blacks, causing you to miss some of the detail that can be found in the dark colors and the blacks.<br /><br />Overall, this film is a wonderful experience. It will stimulate all of your movie-goer senses (auditory, visual, and touch if you have a subwoofer). The script is well written, nicely paced, and albeit predictable at times, wholly enjoyable. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys Sci-Fi, Action, and great character interaction.of film grain (the little speckles on the picture) which is really only noticeable if looking for it on the darker scenes and in some of the fog like effects.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I really wished that I had read the reviews first. I really tried to like this book, but i couldnt. It just made me laugh. All i thought about was that a teenager wrote this book and how they took their fastasy and put it into words on paper. Something that is so beautiful as sex between two adults in love was turned into something dirty in this book.
B000VK99Z6|5.0|The writing of this movie is brilliant. The interaction between Peg and Frost is incredible. It is hilarious. This is the one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Move minion run. so cute and fun! Not to hard not to easy but keeps my attention! Good for wasting time! IT'S SO FLUFFY!!!!!!

B008XG1X18|1.0|I love interest but the app is not working properly at all. It frequently stops working and I am not able to repin. I am not sure if the problem is with my Kindle or if it is the app itself.  Lately I just use Pinteret on my iPhone only.

B00005JMXX|5.0|this show was a great show a little scary cause of what storms can do but anyway thanks a bunch
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Yet another story from the master storytellers. Never a second to take a deep breath, something always about to happen. Pick this up at your own risk, because you will not be able to put it down.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|What else is there to say? It took forever to get to me, because it was sold out. Worth every penny
B00CPLGGXM|5.0|It runs really hot so you need a better heat-sink that the factory P.O.S. they send with it. I opted for a cooler-master Hyper 212. Stays cooler but it is still a hot processor  Usually runs right under 80C while gaming on high. Liquid cooling would probably be the best alternative for this chip but for the price it is the real deal.
B000059MEL|5.0|Discovery has always been my favorite album of theirs and even though I already have the CD I figured \\"why not?\\" and decided to order the vinyl for collector's sake.<br /><br />It's the coolest thing. The packaging is flawless and I was pleasantly surprised to discover a photo of Guy-Man and Thomas as their alter-egos that I'd never seen before inside of it.
B00CCX9DUG|4.0|Enjoyed this book. Follows on from The White Queen and the Cousins War series. Easy to read and would recommend it.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie! The actors in it were amazing and the story line was suprisingly well written. At first I thought it would be just another &#34;miss&#34;, but to me it was a &#34;hit&#34;! I watched it on my iPad during a workout so it helped me get through that! I will watch it again, but next time have my husband watch it too.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|Emeli Sande NEVER disappoints!<br />Incredible sound quality, a wonderful mixture of songs, evoking many moods...<br />The case for the cd was severely cracked and damaged, but the contents were intact.
0061122416|5.0|This book changed my life and the way I perceive human interactions. I highly recommend it to all. A Great Read!
B008QTVNUI|1.0|This series is a great story line ruined, absolutely ruined, by gratuitous sex scenes!  Yikes!  I've been married for 23 year and I even blushed.  What a shame that such a great story line was degraded by some producers desire to &#34;push the envelope&#34; of grittiness and disrupt a great story with porography.  Come on, really?  I could go on, but this kind of trash just isn't worth my time.
B0082RHRHC|4.0|Great story of endurance, overcoming, faith, and Love. Just so very timeless relevance. Loved the good and trying moments! More
B005DJREGQ|5.0|Awkward is so true to life...fun to relive my high school days.  I don't watch MTV much anymore so I never would have found this without my Kindle!
B001KEHAI0|5.0|This is not only one of the best and my all time favorite, there is really a good message to this movie. I am glad to have it in my library.
B00C28J2VQ|3.0|ok movie.<br />not very many 3D effects. should have just bought the 2D version.<br />Story line convoluted. action scenes good.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The characters continue to be what drives this magnificent series but some of the story lines seem a bit tiresome...get Bates out of prison already...and then some story lines are developed and simply dropped with no adequate explanation...what happened with Patrick...and I won't even touch the season ending tear jerker...where o we go from here???  Hopefully back to what made this series so great....
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|At first the number of characters and the twists and turns are almost hard to follow. But WOW what an amazing story! Couldn't put it down, from beginning to end. Highly recommend!
B006MW3UZW|4.0|This most excellent series gets a bit more intriguing albeit the characters motivations are often called into question...at times the story lines lagged a bit...the pacing didn't seem as a depth as in season one but it would be difficult for anyone to improve on one's initial trip to Dowtown Abbey.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|This is Avenged Sevenfolds most straightforward effort. Very groove and hook oriented, without all the crazy time changes. Extremely well recorded, sound-wise. If you're unfamiliar with the band, this would be a good place to start. Just to get an idea of the feel of the album, I'll give some comparisons for my favorite tracks.<br /><br />Shepherd Of Fire - 90's era Megadeth<br />Hail To The King - Black Album Metallica<br />This Means War - Black Album (Sad But True)<br />Crimson Day - Slave To The Grind era Skid Row Ballad<br />Coming Home - Iron Maiden<br />Acid Rain - Dream Theater type ballad<br /><br />Once again, this is what I felt these songs reminded me of. If you've never heard the band or these songs, it's just a reference for you to go by.<br /><br />If you like heavy, groove oriented drums and dueling guitar solo's, you can't miss with this album.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|Just as the 30 day return policy expired the audio began to click and pop so loud it hurt my ears. I replaced batteries over and over, plugged and unplugged. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! Plastic and easily breakable. They are worthless.
B004HD61KE|5.0|This is my first James Rollins book-the first of many if the others are as well written as this.  Suspenseful, interesting, frightening.  Science and history have never been so fascinating to me.
0143124544|4.0|I loved getting to know the characters and the inside view of a paraplegic's life. I hated the ending, hated it! I wish more research would help all those unfortunate souls suffering today with paralysis.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|I found this book disappointingly dull.  The pictures were okay, but as the other reviewers have mentioned, they seemed &#34;gimmicky&#34; .  The storyline started off okay, but became so uninteresting I started skimming pages just to get through it.  I will look at the pictures in the sequel, but won't bother reading it.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|Best game that I have found yet for the Kindle. So much fun. Have .spent so much time and cannot put it down. Completely addictive.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Way fun game,  keeps you coming back for<br /> Nice work!!! Enjoy playing  open to see more levels some day.  Thank you
B0068TJLSY|5.0|I loved this movie. Especially because it reminded me of the comforting aspects of being a kid back in that time. Love the characters and the plot. Recommended!
B005544V6A|5.0|I love this television series. Suits is the perfect combination of everything I look for in entertainment: intelligent humor with action, violence and sex mixed in in perfect amounts.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Best show out there. Well next to duck dynasty. Some thing that the while family can sit down and enjoy.
B001RP1G0U|4.0|If you like romantic comedies and dogs, you might enjoy this film.  Diane Lane and John Cusack play sympathetic 40-somethings who meet at dog park, each with a borrowed dog because Lane's character Sarah, a divorced preschool teacher, has a personal ad written by her sister which says \\"must love dogs\\".<br /><br />The plot curves and careens through some family problems, other dating partners and the usual romantic comedy obstacles.  What makes this film sing a bit are the actors including secondary actors such as Christopher Plummer as Sarah's Irish father. Plummer said recently his career is about the best it has ever been in his 70's and 80's.  This character adds some warmth and depth to the film.  Stockard Channing is a delight, also.  Yes, the plot is a tad cliched and contrived.  But if you want a light rainy day flick to enjoy with some buttered popcorn, and perhaps a dog by your side, this might do the trick. 3.5 stars.
B00DP3IESY|4.0|It may be a little predictable, but it is a fun movie to watch and some great looks into what the future may bring. I bought it and I have already watched it twice. I say go for it if you like good sci-fi.
0307951529|5.0|f you have ever thought about starting up a small business, this book may motivate you to take the next steps. The author persuades: we don't exist to make others rich. There is a microbusiness revolution afoot. What's more valuable than money? Freedom says the author. The rules of work are being rewritten and having a side business oriented toward something you love to do makes sense. With all of the economic uncertainty, a side business can fund retirement, pay for extras or grow into a full-time business. His magic formula: passion or skill + usefulness = success.<br /><br />Found his decision making matrix on page 86 useful which helps you evaluate possible opportunities you have to turn into a business. You rank them on a 5 point scale in terms of impact, effort, profitability, vision and fun and see how they compare numerically. The exercise may help you decide on a direction.<br /><br />If you are thinking of starting up a small business to get paid to do something you love, this book should be thought-provoking, useful and motivating. I've started several small businesses (pre-school, educational consulting and home rentals) and found the information helpful. I think it would be especially helpful for a 20-30 something who may want to start a small business venture. 4.5 stars.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil has written another wonderful tale! Thanks for taking me away from reality for a time! For Neil Gaiman fans you will not be disappointed. Recipe: one rainy day , a good spot and this book from start to finish.
1416955070|5.0|WOW WOW WOW!!! So not what I was expecting. After catching the movie trailer, I found myself wanting to know more about the books as I always prefer to read the book before seeing the film version. And man am I glad I did.  After seeing all the 5 star reviews, I figured I was missing out on something big. And big it is!!<br /><br />The author's use of theology mixed with poetry mixed with pop culture mixed with creative is a recipe for utter success!!<br /><br />I don't like to give spoilers as I feel  it defeats the purpose of reading the book to begin with. So writing this review is going to somewhat short. All I can say is that you are a fan of everything from fairies to werewolves, then \\"The Mortal Instruments\\" is the series for you. With each turn of the page, I waited with bate breath to see what was coming next. Just as I thought I had a clue, out came the monkey wrench, and BAM, a new and excited twist emerged.<br /><br />Well that is all I can say about Book 1 as it is literally paining me that I am not nose deep into Book 2 already.<br /><br />Ok, one last thing, if you're on the fence about \\"The Mortal Instruments\\", get the hell off it already!! You'll be glad that you did :)
B0054LJGWS|5.0|I have the book, but couldn't find it so I got the Kindle version also.  I guess that means I really like this story.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I've been waiting for the Chromecast for over a month now in the hope that finally someone has developed a product where I can watch any video off my phone, Ipad, or laptop.  Based on the description from Google you would think this is the product.  It's not.<br /><br />Product is very limited.  For iPhone and iPad you can only watch Netflix, YouTube, or GooglePlay.  For the laptop, you must use the Google Chrome browser, and product will only play video off the main screen.  If your video plays in a pop up screen like ESPN 3, it won't cast the video.<br /><br />If you don't have a Roku box and only want to watch Netflix, this is the product for you.  You can cast the Netflix show to the TV and continue to access other apps on your iPad or iPhone.  Other than that particular circumstance, there are better options.
B009ZQJ1G4|2.0|Sorry but the premise is ridiculous.  \\"Feelings\\" lead to the demise of mankind therefore all the art must be destroyed?  I only watched for 10 min, the acting and action looked good I just couldn't get past the premise.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I wasn't expecting much from this movie, but it turned out to be very good with a surprise twist at the end.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Worked for me right out of the box. Using android phone and tablets, YouTube Netflix, Google Play movies and music work like a charm. Apparently hulu and HBO are working on it for their apps also. Only thing missing for me is Amazon instant, but they don't currently make an app for any android devices except their own,(kindle fire) so I'm not holding my breath on them doing it anytime soon.
1401937519|5.0|Fascinating, read in three days! Have watched several interviews of her, hope she makes it to Denver one day soon.
B009NLC1D6|4.0|It was well done and Ben Kingsley did a great job playing Gandhi. Got to know more about how India became their own country.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|A great movie about romance. Love the era! But match making, as proven in this movie can be a dangerous thing, especially among close friends
B003LSTK8G|5.0|Lewis simplifies this story of complicated financial products and their fallout. He does so in an entertaining fashion while showing what idiots the leaders of Wall street firms, regulators, and politicians are and how the taxpayers got totally fleeced.
B008220C38|5.0|Great movie! Full of romance and sadness. A chick flick for sure. I'm a chick, so!!! I loved it. The era again is a favorite of mine.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love the game and can not wait to show my sister , she loves this type of game, at least this is free. Enjoy the game
0800141660|5.0|If you love the movies of the past and of love and romance, this is a great one. Love can hurt, especially when you love someone you can't have or shouldn't have. But true love always wins!
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|Just what you want when you pick up this type of book. Action and intrigue, a little romance. A lot like Travis McGee in that way. Gets the girl, doesn't get stuck with her in the end, a la Travis. No special friend (Meyer) and no houseboat, but like Travis, Jack lives on his own terms. Pretty refreshing.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I love the old movies especially about love and romance. What I still don't get about these kinds of movies or I guess about history is why the daughters are never able to inherit any of the father's wealth. And if there is no son, it gets passed down to the next male family member in line who has enough already. The best part of these kinds of movies is that love wins and the guy gets the best chick in the end.
B00E0MCYPS|2.0|To hard to control the car, they should make a new version with a easy way to play . Could be better
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|A very well written story.  The author wrote separate characters, with separate stories that were all interconnected beautifully.  Would definitely recommend this book.
B000HKYN74|5.0|I loved it. I just can't understand why it was cut to 4 seasons only. Maybe it is was not scheduled to air at the right time or was competing with another series. You did not have to end the series...just find a more appropriate time slot.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I LIVE IN FLORIDA, SO ALWAYS WANT TO KNOW IF RAIN IS COMING. I LOVE THE RADAR THAT U CAN MOVE ANYWHERE YOU WANT. REALLY COOL!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|If I paid $10 to see it in a theater I'd probably feel mildly disappointed, but for home video its a good, standard, action/thriller movie.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Dont suport casting from may Chrome browser on may phone and i nott open for 3 part prog.I am disipoynted ():) I exspekt it to cast from may phone in genneral like Apels
B009JZSC9S|5.0|It doesn't seem quite a intense as earlier seasons but still one the best dramas on TV.  Or maybe it is just that after three seasons  the characters are like family -- sort of predictable, but still interesting.  Looking forward to season 5 soon.
1926778537|5.0|This art book is awesome, I love the process of the character Death in this. Its a thick art book with 220 of art work done by Joe &#34;amazing&#34; Madureira. If you are a fan of the Darksiders series, or a fan Joe &#34;Mad&#34; Madureira, then you are going to love this art book.

B004J4WKTW|5.0|A delightful, yet meaningful read...to be enjoyed and savored by all ages...like the circus itself! I did not want to put it down.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|If you enjoy the sultry, Southern California sound of the Seventies, no group better personified that Classic Rock genre than the Eagles. If you were disheartened by the disbandment of Classic Rock's greatest demonstration of vocal and instrumental skill, you will feel great comfort and relief upon hearing the Eagles perform their Farewell 1 Tour Live From Melbourne. Oh, those lucky Aussies! Thank God the Eagles decided to record the Concert for the rest of us! Hurry up and get your copy of this Historic Concert today. Enjoy the perfectly pitched, lyrically nuanced vocals of Don, Glenn, Timothy and Joe. Enjoy the lightning fast, perfectly synchronized riffs of Joe and Glenn, expertly complimented by Steuart Smith, Guitarist Extraordinaire. I put together the perfect Playlist comprised of only five songs from this concert: one-half hour that tells the oldest story known: Boy Meets Girl, Boy Loses Girl. Guess which five songs I used.<br /><br />Here is how I view the greatness of the Eagles: They are a vocal group, through and through.  And their instrumentals are no slouch, either.  Vocally, the \\"Voice\\" of the Eagles is Glenn Frey.  His voice is classically associated with the group's most famous hits.  No one else could sing those songs.  The Group's \\"lead\\" singer, however, the one who has one of the greatest (dare I say, \\"greatest\\") voices in rock 'n roll history, is none other than Don Henley.  His articulation, lyric-writing, intonation, raspiness, and phrasing, are the best, and hardest to duplicate of most any rock 'n roll singer I've ever heard.  I have lately been memorizing the lyrics to his songs and trying to imitate his voice (an octave lower).  When I say it's a hard thing to do, I am not kidding.  What a challenge!  The bass player (superbly tasteful) is Timothy B. Schmidt.  His addition from Poco was the best decision Glenn and Don ever made.  His soft, soulful, high ballad voice is the one that will make me cry time and time again.  I don't care what the words to the song are, my emotions spring out of me when I hear his voice.  And the few songs he has written are all classic.  Lastly, Joe Walsh added to the Hotel California mix was right on time!  Joe has recovered from his addictions (think James Gang era, etc.) and writes anthems about his former and current life.  Joe, don't be embarrassed by, or reluctant to share, those life stories.  You are creating some great music, and providing valuable lessons for younger people who might be going through, or be considering going through, those same journeys.  You are the voice of reason and experience.  The songs that Joe has contributed to the Eagles have helped increase the group's relevance.  Joe's voice is uniquely his own: odd, yet remarkable, and memorable.  He adds many layers to the group's on-stage presence as well.  And as to the quality of his song-writing?  Think \\"Pretty Maids All in a Row!\\"  His outrageous guitar playing also adds a new dimension.  Again, think \\"James Gang,\\" and Funk #49!<br /><br />Lastly, a word about the supporting musicians on this particular concert album.  Eagles, you could not have chosen a better lead-supporting-chording guitarist than Steuart Smith.  For those of you unfamiliar with Steuart's playing, check him out on You Tube.  He is a, largely, unknown monster of a guitar player.  He should become a permanent member of the group, at whatever cost, because in addition to his stellar guitar playing, he sings!  The drummer, keyboardist, and horn players are magnificent.  Had I known about this concert, I would have gladly paid my airfare to Melbourne, and up to $1,000 to attend it.<br /><br />And why is it that the Eagles almost sound better live in concert than in the studio?  One name: Elliot Scheiner.  Elliot recorded and mixed the sounds from the concert for the DVD and Blueray disc.  I hadn't heard of or paid attention to Mr. Scheiner until 2004 when my wife and I purchased an Acura TL.  It has a seven-speaker, plus sub-woofer, surround-sound speaker system that can play specially recorded surround sound discs.  It was built for Acura by none other than Elliot Scheiner.  Folks, Elliot Scheiner is a genius!<br /><br />I began singing rock 'n roll at age 15, forming the first Rock band of my young life.  I had been playing and learning music since 4th grade.  I played trumpet throughout Junior High School, High School, College, and three years in the 75th Army Band at Fort Belvior.  I continued, uncommittedly, for another eight years, using it after I started my professional government career, and played in another two or three rock bands part-time.  I finally withdrew from any musical aspirations at age 33 in 1981.<br /><br />Only now, at age 65, am I trying to regain my musical heritage.  And who's helping me do it?  The Eagles!  Despite all those years playing trumpet, my one true love was singing Rock and Roll.  In most of the rock bands I played in I was either lead or back-up singer.  The Eagle's singing, their Classic Rock roots, their perfect mix of vocals and instrumentals, their songs that have become Rock Standards, are involuntarily drawing me back into my musical past.  I am reviewing this album with all my history intact.  I am forever grateful for Rock and Roll's Greatest Band of all time, The Eagles!ofer, surround-sound speaker system that can play specially recorded surround sound discs.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|This is one of those movies that takes its place in your permanent library.  Human, deep, humorous and each time you see it you will get more out of it.
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is pretty cool. I wish you didn't have to wait for things like energy. But definitely worth it to try out
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I could not put this book down.  A gripping story, a horrific and shameful time in our history.  The story tells the most difficult of situations in a  very tasteful and non-graphic way.  Fantastic book with an ending that is not fairy tale.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I was debating whether to give this 4 or 5 stars, but in the end, I decided that it really is a groundbreaking product that is worth of the top rating, despite having so much more to offer.  Now I say groundbreaking, because up to this point, no other streaming device was so small or so cheap, so this really allows streaming to come to the masses.  I've used streaming video for years now, mostly on my xbox or blu-ray player, but this device lets me easily and aesthetically bring Netflix, etc. to our bedroom TV, where we don't have a bunch of set top boxes connected.<br /><br />As to improvements I would like to see... (1) better Wi-Fi reception. I live in a 3 level townhome, with the wireless router in the middle level.  The Chromecast does not work well on the 1st level, and sometimes has connection issues on the 3rd.  Other devices, like my wireless blu-ray player, do not have reception issues, so I think this is an area of improvement.  (2) More content. I would like to see HBO Go and other streaming services available, as opposed to pretty much just Netflix and Youtube.<br /><br />If Netflix is your go to service, then this is a must have product.  All in all, a great step in bringing easy streaming to every house and every TV.
0062511408|5.0|I really mean &#34;fabulous&#34; and with a surprising and amazing ending.  Paulo Coelho continues to be one of my favorite writers.
B00AOVXOQW|5.0|My son loves this train. The cement mixer turns and the coal car wiggles on the way down the track. The colors are vibrant. It will also pull other trains along with it down the track. It can go in reverse direction and has a headlight as well. It is a bit slow, but it is still a hit at our house.
0439023521|5.0|As others have said this whole series is really great. I did a kindle loan for the books originally and went back to buy it so I can re-read it. I am sure that I will pick up on missed details the second time through!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Terribly inconvenient / using a remote app on iPad or iPhone for Apple TV is a superior experience, but still not the solution I was expecting.  Lame!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great writing. The show always somehow brings fresh stories to each and every episode. Lots of fun. Never boring. Highly recommended!
B005544TRQ|5.0|Watched all of Season 1 and 2 in 3 sittings! Characters are sublime. The chemistry between the characters is awesome. Began watching the show on network TV. USA Network hit a home run with this show.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Inde movie with great performances and engaging story. Mature themes, so not best for the younger crowd. A quiet but satisfying film.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love that it's a free app, I love that there are free books, I love that the free books are typically the begining of a series and since I love series books, thats a great fit for me!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book, keeps you tuned in for sure and written well. Never got bored with this book. Would recommend to anyone that is not offended by a lot of sexual details.
0385474547|5.0|love this book, its so awesome, but i hate how it ends, what was the point of that.?! Things fall apart lol
B005QYKD4I|4.0|Don't watch this movies if you are looking for a movie that has would have been nominated for an academy award. The principle of this movie I'd fun, action, romance, and patriotism. Lots of fun!
B0091REZMW|2.0|This would be a fun game if it didn't stop working so much and it was faster it's to slow for me I like timed fast pace games.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Enjoy the eargasm!!!!!!  That's all I can say....you're welcome.  Now get a towel and go clean yourself off. Disco and Funk Tribute Band!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0446580848|3.0|In my opinion, this is not the kind of book that you will miss once you finish it.  However, if you are looking for entertainment and not necessarily a great novel, The Panther may be the book for you. The novel is 625 pages, so I often found myself saying, I wish the author would get this over with.<br /><br />If you are a diehard fan of Mr. DeMille, which I used to be, you are probably going to like this book, but he has done much better in the distant past. For this one, I give it just a meow, not a roar.
B00AZMFO6I|4.0|So great to have movies that those of us who have passed middle age can relate to.  The quality of seasoned actors is far superior to the new crop of actors and their movies.  Hooray for this kind of movie.
0544104404|3.0|My niece is in her second year of Teach for America in a really terrible middle school very much like the ones he described.  The high school next door to it is a drop-out factory.  It is absolutely clear that most of the kids in that school are going to repeat the mistakes of their parents.  My niece sings in the choir of the local church, but she does not see her students or their families at church.  I picked up this book hoping for thoughtful solutions to this absolutely appalling situation.  There is no doubt that the author understands the magnitude of the problem.  (Which is the reason for the three stars.)  But he is either unwilling or unable to propose a comprehensive solution.<br /><br />To get through a tough middle school and high school and to get into college and to complete college and to avoid its distractions, a student needs to be persistent and determined.  That's not news.  The rare kid from a bad neighborhood can do well if he or she has a strong mentor.  Not news.  That there is a chemical basis for the life outcomes of badly parented kids is interesting.  Schools and after-school programs can help a little bit, but the parent(s) make the biggest difference.  We knew that.  We also know that two parents are better than one, but he won't say that.  His thesis is that now that we have scientific evidence for these concepts, maybe we can reform the government support system for poor kids and do better than we do now.  That's a pretty weak conclusion.  He does not address the effect of fatherless families, rap music, grisly movies, TV shows that make parents (and most adults) seem like idiots or the absence of religion in the lives of so many.  He does not compare results before the war on poverty, when there were many more fathers in poor families, with the present.  He never mentions Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts or Catholic schools.  For him, the idea that character counts is news.  He does not explore the institutions that existed before 1965 thatinstilled character.  He is the father of a toddler, and sees the world that way.  He does not seem to have any middle school, high school or college kids in his life.  He does not seem to have seen good kids whom he knows from good families go bad.  Or how kids act out in middle school and high school, or the many distractions of college.  Also, he does not want to say -- or to even imply -- anything that would be controversial to a devoted reader of the New York Times.<br /><br />There is a good, bold, insightful book to be written about these issues.  This is not it.  Not even close.
0545586178|5.0|The only problem was that I was super busy when I was trying to read this book and all I wanted to do was find out what happens next!
0307950689|2.0|Some parts of this book were actually entertaining and interesting.  Little snippets or factoids like the etymology of \\"sincerely\\".  I was even willing to suspend disbelief on all the masonic nonsense because, frankly, I can believe that others believe this stuff and do all this.  Despite its being such transparent hokum.  But I cannot accept the bizarrely twisted \\"science\\" that is presented here.  Nor the gratuitous bible-babble that comprises the final scenes and epilogues.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor -- once the \\"bad guy\\" is killed, put the book down and walk away.  Else you may punch a wall and hurt yourself...like I did!<br /><br />The other reviewers are largely correct.  The characters are cliched and copied.  The scene from the Abyss is a rip-off and obvious as anything.  (When was the last time an author killed off his bread and butter character in the MIDDLE of tbe book?)  And Brown is manipulative as hell -- he TELLS you the origin of the bad guy as the narrator, and then changes it when convenient to pull a surprise.  Very poor taste and indicative of a talent vacuum.<br /><br />Two stars is the best I can do.
0439023521|5.0|Well written.  Many people don't realize the hunger games are going on now.  The trilogy can be a depressingly realistic statement about what people do to one another.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I just wish that the recharge for being able to research the photos worked faster. I enjoy searching the pictures for the hidden objects. It takes me back to my childhood and highlights magazines which my daughter now gets.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I think it was exiting and a must have ! There was so many twist and turns! You must get this book
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this is the best game and battle beach is behind this one<br />it may sound boring but its not<br />so play it or die ha ha ha
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This just keeps getting better......holds your interest.  The acting continues to be superb.  Can't wait for the next season to begin.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I play this game with my grandson. I really appreciate the fact that we share an interest in a game that is fun and not violent. He is seven years old. I am 46. We both giggle and race to see who can finish first. A really great game to play alone or share with a competitive grandchild.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|This was pure fantasy, sometimes hard to follow with all of the switching between characters and time.  I have enjoyed all of Mr. Albom's previous books and that is why I purchased this one.  However, it did not keep me as engaged as the others.  The characters did not draw me in as well and the message was convoluted.  However, it won't stop me from buying his next book.
0553573403|5.0|I love love love the show so I bought the book and I love the book even more. Can't wait to read book two!
B005VPRETE|5.0|Our grandson loves Legos so we thought we would try the feminine approach for our granddaughter's 7th birthday.  Easy to follow directions and a theme that is much more peaceful, which we like.  Most important:  she loves it!
B007RFDQN4|5.0|Chaplin's movies were some of the first my parents owned. I am a big fan of him.<br />Seeing the story of his life with such great acting was refreshing!
0399165274|4.0|I always enjoy a Forsyth novel.  This one had suspense, spy technology, terrorism and heroism.  My only complaint -it was too short!
B005544V6A|5.0|This is the season that started it all for me. Suits is one of the best shows as far as I 'm concerned that is on USA now. Watch it and I am sure you will agree.
B009RX85N0|5.0|I like how the players explain the psychological reasoning behind the actions and puts forth the positive.  There is a lot to learn.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I had never watched this show until I saw it on Prime. I took a chance to watch and fell in love with it. I loved the interaction of the characters. Just wish that three had been free too. Oh well, what are you gonna do?
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Loved the book and the movie did a good job capturing the story.  Can't wait to see the other movies in the series.
B00AGKH6D8|4.0|It was just as I expected, good solid funk reminiscent of 70's style urban stuff. Definitely not disco, It reminded me a little of the stuff Jeff Beck was doing when he was playing with the guys from the band Upp.
B009CGYO0K|4.0|I love this book because  I am a cat lover! this book is the best book for people who have a big sense of humour!
B00E3BK0QQ|5.0|The game is definitely five stars but the price is not. That being said, the game was very entertaining. I did not experience any glitches and the puzzles were not extremely difficult.
B005HSL626|3.0|My girls love Fruit ninja but the ads that display are not appropriate for children. For example they are advertising Showtime shows. I paid for the pay version to remove ads since I can't control the ads in the free version. Overall the game is great .
B007THA4FI|3.0|A whole new type of writing from the Potter series. It seems that Ms. Rowling has a new dictionary and tries to use new words at every juncture. Story was just OK
B005FDWM6M|5.0|This movie is amazing. It follows the book really well and the soundtrack is gorgeous! I have always loved the book and the fact that it is a movie is fantastic. They did a splendid job on it and the acting was also really good. Well Done!
B008OW1S3O|5.0|I leave this review for two reasons- the first to tell you how refreshing, haunting, and effective this album is. The second to say- stop giving it a genre! It's OK to just enjoy something new and refreshing and be able to recommend it to ALL your friends, knowing everyone can get something from it.  Leave it be and enjoy!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Brilliantly  acted,  with  an intriguing  plot  throughout  the  entire  season  ending  in  a  suspenseful  cliffhanger! I  can't  wait  to  catch  session 4
B004RJMUJO|5.0|I bought this game on accident and it turned out to be pretty good... I dont regret buying it at all.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This may be the best 99 cents I've ever spent for anything. This game makes you think and gives you just enough hints without giving you answers. If you get stuck you can go onto something else and then go back, but you can't get any answers or solutions. a great game, I can't wait for the next edition.
B00DDZM0GQ|4.0|Fun for sometime, but I suck at it ahahaha. I like this game though. Very good strategy game! Good developing. No crashes, no problem at all
0525478817|5.0|this book is amazing! i read it in two days. be prepared to cry because i cried like a baby
B004VMUS9G|4.0|I like this alarm, but I use a different one because this one is kind of boring for the way it looks
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|This remake is dark, full of action sequences, with awesome visual effect, definitely an entertaining movie. (Contains very graphic and violent scenes) Not recommended for children!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00DB31Y3U|5.0|I played it for some time and I will tell you that it was a game that was very playable!!!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Very clear; can follow local weather, current and future, and weather-related stories from around the world as well as specific cities where family live.
B0061S0A64|5.0|I like this app because its a music app and a just a fun app to use when your bored. The music you make is catchy and while your making music, you try different things and the app gets really fun. But it lags after you keep on putting more instruments. But who cares, it lags after like 100 instruments. I recommend this app, great developing and just a amazing beat maker.
1476712042|5.0|I bought this because it was recommended for those who have read Easy by Tammara Webber. I'll admit it took me a couple times reading the first couple pages to really get into it. But I thought one day why not take it to class with me because I'll be getting there about 20 minutes early. I instantly fell in love with this book. I read 300 pages in one day then finished it completely the second day. Any time I wasn't reading this book I was thinking about reading it or what was going to happen next. I almost could not put it down. I began arriving to all my classes early just so I could sit and read the book until the last minute before my classes started. It's an amazing book. It surely knows how to pull at your emotions and your heart. I'm looking forward to reading Walking Disaster and reading this over and over again.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I dont usually get the weather channel app for any of my devices. But the only reason why I got it is because of 2 things<br />-The User interface<br />-The weather widget on the status bar<br /><br />The weather widget is nice and flat looking so its easy to read and its not annoying<br />The app can find all the cities I want and display accurate weather that anyone can believe! Perfect 10/10
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A voracious reader friend of mine had given this book a high rating - and now I pass this rating on to the next fan of great, ready to be devoured sci-go.  After I finish this review, I am heading straight on to buy the next book(s) in the series.  What a great discovery.  Thanks, Phil!
B00DMM3WVM|5.0|I have experienced some crashing when opening the app, but not during gameplay. I like the graphics on the game, no lag and no graphic display problems
B001EBWING|5.0|This is the best movie ever made. Even the cast didn't know the ending because it was being written as the movie was being filmed. Chemistry between Rick and Ilsa is amazing.
B006YC74E8|4.0|Its a great, free, photo making application. I like it because of its features and the things you can do to your photo you have on your Kindle.
B00003CXBH|4.0|Sad commentary on our European colonialism and how we treated the native peoples of the Americas. And Robert De Niro acting?  Powerful....'nuff said.
0061122416|4.0|A lovely journey of the soul which brings home the message that we get signs all along the soul's journey which appear more clearly to those who stay humble, live within the confines of the moment, and tread lightly, ready to be carried on the winds of change.
1582701709|5.0|I watched the video on youtube which is about 1 hour and 45 mins. The book is great as a helpful reference and reminder.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I am 1/2 way through season one and really like it.  I hope it does not turn into some weird drama as it seems a lot of series do.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|Other than Bethesda RPG's (TES/Fallout), this is far and away the best video game series I have ever played. I can't say enough about it, and this is easily one of the best deals out there. Metal Gear 1 and 2, MGS 1-4 and Peacewalker for $50? I'd have paid $100.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This disc came as expected and on time.  For lovers of downtown abbey, this continues a great series. Dependable service as always.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a very addictive game.  As a grandma, my grandson got it on my phone.  Well, I think I probably play it more than he does.  You just keep wanting to do better.
B008OM0EDO|1.0|Only watched it for 5 mins and couldn't take it anymore.  The beginning was awful.  The actors are all a joke!
0375842209|5.0|i really enjoyed the book. it's a story i will remember and it's well written.  it tells of WWII from a unique perspective i think.  i am surprised it's considered for young adults
159315724X|5.0|This is a great book.  I had the pleasure to get a look at this book when Darren first offered it the the readers of Success. Now that he has shared it in a book format it is still great. I am a person that listens to every Success cd interview that Darren Hardy has done for several years. The information that is shared just like the book are great.  The Compound Effect of the cds are listened to regularly in my car and while I am driving my motorcycle.  I have enjoyed all of the stuff on local rides and my long distance rides from Virginia to Chicago, Ohio, New Orleans, North Carolina, South Carolina, New York, New Jersey etc.  Yes, I am hungry for knowledge and useful information.  My vehicles to me are my universities on 2 and 4 wheels.  Darren's succeed magazine has even given me ideas for my radio show. The compound Effect has also been a inspiration. Our show had grown and  I am a better me. Our show named, The Zurriane Show has thousands of listeners. Link: [...] The Compound Effect has been a wealth of inspiration and encouragement to me and I am sure it has also been so for thousands of others.  By the way thanks for making a cd version. It is one more great tool.  My personal and financial success in the areas that I am working hard on are coming one book, CD and DVD and positive action at a time. I hope to one day get to interview Darren Hardy on my show. Givers Gain<br /><br />Best to you all!<br />Zurriane
B0044XV3R8|5.0|My husband and I tried to watch the movie on USA ( but we're used to no commercials) but we were able to make out enough ot what was going on with the movie that we wanted to see it. Great movie worth the wait.
B008476HBM|5.0|i really enjoyed this book and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys light books. its a simple book and easy to read.
B002S8AGZG|5.0|This is one of the greatest 'chick flicks' that I have watched and could watch it again and again. No bad language that made me flinch and loose interest in the movie.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Absolutely love Downton Abbey!  Can't wait for next season!  Just love the costumes and the real people actors.  So unhollywoodish!
B008JFUO4U|2.0|I kept waiting for the movie to make some kind of sense. I'm guessing it just wasn't my kind of movie. The previews got my attention, the movie dropped it.
B00CF34B2I|4.0|While I do enjoy playing this app, installing the app was a nuisance, as the app didntry to say I didn't have sufficient hd space, which was false.  Also, i've had instances of cards not wanting resolve properly, and of the app freezing. Mostly minor issues but aggravating in the middle of play. Would like to see these issues fixed, then I wojld rate this app a 5
B00EXVZW6E|5.0|ALL of the Hidden Object Quest games by this developer are awesome! They have everything you look for in a hidden object game-professional graphics, variety, &quot;replayability&quot;, challenging and engaging, but not frustrating! If you play the classic object quest several times on each level first...then move on to the other modes...this allows you to become more familar with all of the objects before having to play in the other harder modes. This helps alot where speed counts! My only complaint is that the new games don't come out quick enough so I really like the fact that each game can be played over and over and different each time!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Good quick read. Fairly indepth story line, but still easy to follow. Few spelling errors but overall entertaining. Will read again most likely.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|was a waste of my time.  couldn't find any continuity.  maybe typical of current writing styles - I will try to avoid!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I enjoyed the series. My least favorite character is Carrie. She gets under my skin. Looking forward to season 2
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|Film was drenched in flashy, glossy magazine clothing and make-up. The plot, scenarios and characters were ridiculous.<br />I couldn't help but ask basic questions:<br />\\"Where did that mirror come from?\\"<br />\\"How much would a mirror like that cost?... more than the heist?\\"<br />\\"What kind of work force would it require to transport and install a mirror like that?\\"<br />\\"How long would it take?\\"<br /><br />I know, I know... it's a movie. But even these kinds of holes do require some patching to create continuity.<br /><br />Although the movie was \\"action-packed\\", it was too under-developed and hence is more appropriate for kids.<br />Still, the movie was okay for a rental if you're hard pressed to find anything to rent. Even with that in mind, it left me slightly wishing I had not seen it at all.<br /><br />Kids movie - 4 stars<br />Adult movie - 2 stars
B00EB6F1TY|4.0|Another action movie that fall in the same order as the other Iron Man series. Tho this one was a bit differn't with a better story that keep you in suspense,for most of the time. It really looks like Iron Man has met his match, but you will be surprised to see who the real hero is at the end.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|I'm not too crazy about Deb being involved now and I really didn't like the last episode but this series draws me in.  I'm looking forward to Season 8.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|wish it was more than 10 levels.  really challenges your mind on the last few.  took 2 days to beat it.  total of about 3-4 hrs.  I'm a mom with 3 kids so I only played when I could...lol. Very enjoyable
B003G4W49C|5.0|I just love this book, love space and syfy. Could not stop reading this book!! He (Mr Card) is very detail.
1878424319|5.0|I love this personal guide.  I reccommend this book to anyone who has living to do  - living with the freedom to be happy and enjoy life.
B008EEZ64Y|5.0|Hello kindle fire owners This is a good book .I was required to read It for a book report but I found it quite interesting
B001TXWJ4M|5.0|It is pretty intense. But I am a fan of Dexter and Breaking Bad is just so much more than Dexter. We started with Season 1 and are working our way to the last Season. We wanted to know what all the hype was about this series. Not for the squeamish.
B006C45MRE|4.0|Daniel Craig did an amazing job and the alien creatures were believable in a old west setting that was realistic
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I love a good action movie and this is one I loved. I thought I had the ending figured out but then...
B00CRWJ5GO|4.0|It was pretty easy to follow given the time periods kept changing and using the same characters with make up made it easy to see who was who. Puts a whole new spin on reincarnation and the whole fate and destiny thing of how we are all created and some of us linked together through space and time.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We have the found the main characters to have chemistry together.  The script has subtle humor that gives them more depth and reality along with a sincere respect for each other.
B00328G4Y8|5.0|It came to me in new condition thanks to amazon and ups and sounds terrific thanks to Jimi Hendrix . Little wing, castles made of sand, one rainy wish, and bold as love are all on here which gives this album 5 stars. I'm not a big fan of the video though. Wish it was some live Jimi songs on the album instead of guys talking about the album
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Love Homeland!!!<br />Was hooked from the start and could not stop watching till the end.<br />Excited for season 2. Recommend that every one watch HOMELAND, start today!
B004LUS390|3.0|I Picked this app up after hearing a lot of gushing reviews. It is definitely one of the best.out there, but does not feature landscape mode. If you draw horizontally, your picture will be saved sideways. Most artists I know draw in landscape, so trying to upload on the go is a bit of an issue.  Please fix this ERROR
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Awesome series.  Great acting well written.  Fantastic scenery, incredible mansion.  You get drawn in and want to watch show after show.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This product does exactly what it states a desktop remote you can use from your android tablet or kindle to control computers with splash top streamer it is awesome
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|This is a very addicting game. It's hours of fun.  Sometimes it's hard to get into small spaces, but I like the challenge.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I haven't used this that often but it seems easy to use and I like the look of it too. The display is easy to read.
B0040YFR1Y|5.0|THE PREDATORS MOVIE IT IS AT A LOW PRICE RIGHT NOW AND THE HAY PREDATOR/PREDATOR 2 IN ONE CASE ON AMAZON TOO. I GOT ALL 3 PREDATOR MOVIES AND WITH TAX AND ALL I GOT THEM FOR LESS THAN $19.00. THAT'S FOR BLU-RAYS, THAT IS THE ULTIMATE, OUTSTANDINGLY SPECTACULAR AWESOMELY GREATEST DEAL EVER!
B00AYB1KHW|3.0|The acting is fairly good in this monster movie, but the monster is less than believable. Made for teenagers and would probably appeal to them, especially with Elijah Wood as one of the actors.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love this app.  I have it on my phone (note2), tablet and computer.  I liked the previous version before the update also.  The only thing I wish it would do is let me put books in folder under author or read ect. I have a lot of books and sometimes end up re trying to download the same one.
B00B04NJI0|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />You have to be in a certain mood to appreciate \\"The ABC's of Death,\\" an omnibus film in which twenty-six directors from around the world have contributed a short - indeed very short - work on the subject of death, each beginning with a different letter of the alphabet (F, for instance, features death by fart).<br /><br />At well over two hours in length, the finished project provides a mishmash of movie genre parodies and pastiches, along with live action, claymation, and animated sequences - and lots and lots of gratuitous blood and gore. The tones of the pieces range from serious and  unnerving to surrealistic and satirical.<br /><br />Unfortunately, with rare exceptions, the quality of the segments isn't all that high, certainly not enough to compensate for the decidedly unpleasant nature of the material. So what we're ultimately left with is an \\"art\\" slasher film - a drawn out and not very entertaining exercise in self-indulgent morbidity.<br /><br />I guess the whole thing is supposed to make us all wiser to the fact that Death, in its myriad forms, is always just around the corner waiting to pounce on us at a moment`s notice. Only occasionally - as with X, which deals, albeit gruesomely, with the issue of body image - do the episodes try for any kind of social significance beyond the purely sensational (L is particularly disturbing and R is simply gross).<br /><br />As stated before, it's all a matter of taste.
B00AECGQF2|1.0|No review game never downloaded. Im sure my granddaughters would have loved it if it had downloaded. Sure glad it was free.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|This is a great movie for kids and parents, it has an all star cast and makes for a great family movie night.
B000OT8GCQ|5.0|Was a bit disappointed in the ending of the book compared to the movie. Over all such a great read!!!!
1932907009|5.0|Special note to Mr. Snyder...<br /><br />Okay Blake, you were successful, if your attempt was to make me rewrite my script.
B00AZMFJYA|4.0|I feel like they tried to do to much with the story.  Is there going to be others?? Outstanding job though.
B003W5C0VW|4.0|And I only got 1 disc in mine but it's still an excellent concert film of the Stones during the Exile On Main Street tour years. Has some absolutely excellent footage. Exile on Main Street is one of my favorate LP's/CD's.

If you need good advise for killing them would lighting them up with flint and steel ,and then hit it three times with an axe. And if you are being chased by&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip; sorry my character fell down my ditch  okay when you are being chased by creepers you would make a ditch and lead them right into it. Good luck people these things are everywhere.  YOU WILL NEED IT.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|I'm one of those sorts who actually really loves very little of what's produced as far as popular music. I heard \\"Closer\\" on the radio a few weeks back and it caught my attention. I decided to download this CD and see if I liked the other songs, and I can honestly say that every single one of them is awesome. These girls are amazingly talented artists, and each of these songs has emotional depth that'll speak to those who are willing to listen. Closer is probably the most shallow candy-pop sounding of the tracks, though I must say I love it for that. I doubt the others would be radio hits, but that speaks for the character of mainstream radio these days and not the songs =P.<br /><br />I haven't found a CD I liked enough to buy it in a long time. This one is excellent :).
B009LQKHIO|5.0|Amazing story of survival, strength and the power of love. A fantastic read from beginning to end. The characters are endearing and the entire book is heart warming.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|Seems to be a fun top down battle game. Can't wait to try out the online multiplayer. For a free game it is kinda fun.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|Incredible all the knowledge and experience lost in the past. Greenblatt help us to retrieve and to aware the worth of this knowledge through the perspective of Lucretius work. The book is very clear and readable without scholar pretentiousness.
630471193X|5.0|John did a marvelous job of this role, and to me it was a story about human potential - what we all can become.  It also clearly showed how easily people can judge negatively out of fear, what they don't understand.  Friends turned on friends, because they perceived him as now 'different' than them.  The characters were believable, had depth, and delivered solid performances.  Some magic sparkles through too.  A must watch, I would recommend this movie to everyone...
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The rest of the cast is great but you find yourself waiting for every scene to hear what witheringly witty words Ms Smith is going to utter! A plum part for a great actress.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised. I am not a big fan of space opera like sci-fi but the Old Man's War is cleverly written. Perhaps the description of the main characters is not very deep, especially when it comes to psyche but nevertheless the pace of the novel is high and does not allow you to be bored. I highly recommend this book for anyone who likes sci-fi.
B000JQUGVI|5.0|This story.  Oh my.  This story.  I bought this book as a teen and have carried it with me in very worn paperback for the last 23 years.  However, this time I wanted it on my Kindle so we got it again.  This book still resonates with me even as a grown woman, maybe more than it did when I was a teen.  Really a classic.  Cannot say enough good things.
1564148793|4.0|WOW! exactly what I needed in this time of my life where someone has it out for me!  Have done nothing wrong to anyone but hate has a hold of them and I need protection against that - hate.  I need to be protected 24/7 and this book gives me great ideas on how to do just that.  Good book to have handy.
B009MYARIK|5.0|This book made me laugh out loud! It was just what I needed; a light, well written, somewhat silly, yet still believable story that entertains on every page. I will seek other works by this author.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|But still a fun beach book.  A little mystery and certainly an intriguing plot, but not the typical Grisham with laughing and crying.

B006BFK5DK|3.0|Amazing musicians grasping at what used to be. Too many personal statements in music form. BUT look for two outstanding cuts.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|My review title says it all. There's always more to found, more to discover, more pixels of vary kinds to solve. The time frame given to search for objects could be longer. I enjoy hidden object puzzles and play a number of them. This by far is the most challenging and rewarding. Enjoy and it a good thing you run out of every so you are forced to get some actual rest.
B00DVKOYBM|3.0|I taught I would be playing against the computer not someone else. Don't know about the coins but think it is Amazon's way to make more money. Would have liked to try before downloading. Would rather played eight bail, nine bail and regular pool against myself or the computer.
B004P9MRLM|2.0|Now I confess I gave up after watching the first series. I liked the first episode, but then as it turned into a series of even more savage and bizarre attacks against women (I think the man keeping his victim alive in a freezer unit was where I threw in the towel)I started to enjoy the snappy dialogue, cinematography and fine acting less and less. I did try and watch another couple of episodes after-almost the first series but it was a struggle. I don't get it? What is pleasurable about watching graphic violence against women who are portrayed as defenceless and then counterpointing it with an unrealistic story line of a female psychopath who is stalking the main character like an Iago to Othello? Too much of the plots defy credibility. It depends on even increasingly far fetched ultra violent hooks to keep you engaged. Me, I just felt sicker and sicker. Think how effective is a shower after a swim in this human sewer and its fiction to boot. Luther the main protagonist also loses credibility. He has regular temper tantrums in full public display including in his work; every cop in the shop would know his business-there would be no need for some special branch type internal investigator (who looks as if they accidently woke up as Smiley in 2010)to be involved. Case closed-obvious the man has oversteeped the line and then some. Then there is the story line of the moral dilemma of Luther aiding the paedophile in the first episode fall to his likely death. No he survives. Really? Should Luther have saved him so he could go on trial. Then there is the problem of engaging with the shenanigans of the relationship of Luther, his wife (she boffed someone else while they were having time apart)and the triangle with her new paramour. A story line that also lacked credible oxygen-dysfunction celebrated in the beauty of the protagonists, supposed intelligence and sense of entitlement- all excusing the bad behaviour and seedy goings on between them. So although it is well acted, superb photography, intelligent dialogue-it was too gratuitous in its portrayal of vicious death and torture.I'm turfing my copy-don't need it., superb photography, intelligent dialogue-it was too gratuitous in its portrayal of vicious death and torture.I'm turfing my copy-don't need it.

B004TSXUWY|2.0|The concept of this book feels very unoriginal. There are also a few major plot holes. I kept reading, and to be fair the twist did surprise me at the end, but ultimately I wouldn't recommend this book to friends and family.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I have already written a review. This is a smart, sassy, intelligent, intriguing show. So far, however, I'm not as crazy about season 3, .
0385344228|5.0|An emotional journey that focuses on the warped view parents often have of their children - they just can't comprehend their shortcomings.  A searing look inside of  troubled family.
B00B4Z5GDQ|3.0|WAs Okay but I would not recommend it for all people.  People that like documentaries and music would be impressed.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Really kept me interested the whole time. I loved how it would alternate each chapter between Nick and Amy. Very different and thrilling.
B005UG542S|5.0|I've been waiting to see this for ages.  Who knew you could sit down and watch it on your computer for 2 bucks!
0307454568|5.0|Where as the first book of the series took a while to get started with all the set up. This book starts right out and doesn't let up. A real page Turner.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Very exciting and action filled throughout to the final page.  Loved every word.  Strongly suggest you give it a try
B002NN5F7A|1.0|Boring. Boring. Boring. Boring. Boring. Boring. Boring. Boring. Boring<br />and have I mentioned that I think this movie is boring?  there I finally met the word limit for your review requirements.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I've just received it and could'nt wait to get it out of the box, it was so easy to assemble and only took about 5 minutes, and it is absolutely amazing well worth the wait and looks amazing next to the season two zombie head limited edition. If you are a Walking Dead fan this item is a must!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|We've been reading this at bedtime for a few months and are sad to have come to the end. Reading the ups and downs of the Marches has been a wonderful journey.
B00ECU1A6C|1.0|I made a bad mistake.  I downloaded the movie before I watched the trailer.  OOPS.  This movie, which my six year old granddaughter was looking forward to watching, is for teenagers.  But what teenager wants to watch My LIttle Pony anything?  And I know, nine and ten year olds want to BE teenagers.  But not my six year old granddaughter.  Oh well. Live and learn.  Maybe the writers of the My Little Pny series should stick to one age group.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|Brought to life much of the book we all had to read in high school. The adult themes frankly are best understood by adults with some years on them...meaning a teenager can watch it yet won't &#34;understand&#34; the real struggles, heart ache, betrayal and denial etc faced by the protagonists. A great date night film- serve with Gin Rickies, and good food.
B0060MYM7O|4.0|I don't mind waiting for the complete season videos to be released, it gives the viewer the control of what to watch and when ,without subscribing to a premium cable channel.<br />This has been an interesting series thus far, lots of twists and turns in the story.
B0038P59A0|5.0|A fun fast paced rendition of the ever so clever Sherlock. Enjoyable from both a plot and cinematic perspective. Great in the theatre and at home
B00D6SBOWG|3.0|I was especting something different. I don't like having to use money to buy suppliments to the game.I deleated it

B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|If you can't solve the combination lock, It makes you start over. too complicated. I've used others that are more challenging but not as difficult
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved this book.  The character development was so good that I actually had feelings about each character.  The plot took me places that I didn't see coming.  The interweaving of these people's lives kept me reading and not wanting the book to end.  I'm looking forward to reading more from Moriarty.
B0070XFNDE|5.0|The mystery about Zafon is why his Cemetery Of Forgotten Books series isn't a phenomenon similar to J. K. Rowling's Harry Potter series.  I have read all of the books in the series and have enjoyed every one of them, proven by the fact that I have finished all of them in less then two days. For the record LOTTE (Length Of Time To End) happens to be my criteria for assigning stars.
B00B4Z5GDQ|4.0|really liked this film. i watched to test my amazon prime app that is FINALLY available for my LG tv and to test the yamaha sound bar and I was very impressed.  The sound was great , along with the information presented in the film.

B000KIPD5E|5.0|Hey, this is a very cool AB switch, that does more that your standard AB switch. The two modes and volumes makes this a step up from the norm. And the LED's shows you what path you've taken, just by looking. Other well known brands sell these with less features for way more money. Above all else, making it in pedal form makes it all the more usable. I use it to play guitar in stereo/mono between two amps, but you could use it to switch between two guitars, or whatever switching needs you have. Cool deal here. I know the price won't hurt you either.
B0016Q6CQI|5.0|I love the show, the episode, and this album! The music is straight from the show and magnificent. Highly recommend.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I can't write a review. It would end up a love letter. :D  I have never loved a series this much. So realistic. Feel like I'm personally involved with each charicters. I cry weekly, sometimes happy, sometimes not. Every tear is shed truly because I love the people. Perfection.
0142410705|5.0|John Green never ceases to impress me with his books! Prior to An Abundance of Katherines I read The Fault In Our Stars and Looking For Alaska (which are amazing books) and so I decided I had to read this because it was John Green and I loved it! If you liked LFA and TFIOS, then this is a must read.
B00CPWTRAA|5.0|Classic pieces from VII operas sung by the consummate  Spanish artist -Bravissimo! Worth double the price. I shall pick up 2 more as Xmas gifts.
0141345659|5.0|This book is hands down one of the best books I've ever read, and I read a lot! Everything about this book was perfect. The characters are so real and I found myself loving them as though they were real people. It goes through so many emotions and you might find yourself emersed in the book further than you expected.<br /><br />WARNING! This book will send you on an emotional journey and you will find yourself in tears, but you won't regret a single second you spent reading it.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Great casting chemistry, and performances. Nicely done show. Strong characters that play and feed off each other. I Have enjoyed all the seasons.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I think that coin dozer is not the best game in the world but it is a good game. but it needs to have a chance for people to get the puzzels so they can unlock the other puzzle games.
B00846REIS|4.0|After hearing all the comparisons to Fifty Shades of Grey, I expected this to be a complete copy. But it had enough differences to keep it interesting. I like the character of Gideon, but Eva was a little annoying. Regardless, I really enjoyed the book, and look forward to the follow-up.
B005HSL626|4.0|This is a fun game. My daughter and I like to play it sometimes, I just don't like the ads. Other than that, it's fun.
B000HZHBIM|5.0|Amazing - I'm a Trekkie and I saw it 3 times in the theatre.  See this movie!  You won't regret it.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The book was disjointed. It had several story lines that were loosely connected. Keeping track of the characters was difficult.
B005D643PO|5.0|I absolutely loved season 4 with John Lithgow.  He's a hard act to follow.  Season 5 has a great plot, with some surprise twists, like the writer of Dexter seems to include each season.  I could curse my sister for introducing me to Dexter.  I was up until 2am watching 4 episodes!
B00AECGQF2|1.0|I can't see the point of this game complete rubbish you keep doing the same thing over and over again - deleted!!
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|It is so terrable they should take it off the shelf they should not allow this games this terrable on the shelf
B00ANA27IU|5.0|I loved this book, back when I was in college, ah, those were the days. It seems rather old fashioned these days, what with photon blasters and worm-holes, but it is still a classic worth reading, and surprisingly cheap.
B004HWYTP4|3.0|It was an ok movie, a little slow in some parts. I enjoyed somewhat but ended up losing interest towards the end.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|Season 4 of the Good Wife does not disappoint. Season four is as fresh and interesting as season one.  Additionally, you now feel as if you know the characters and are invested in their success.  Without a doubt, one of the best ensemble casts on network television.  Looking forward to Season 5.
B009LQKHIO|3.0|I don't usually read Romance type novels but was curious about the title, &#34;Finding Pride&#34;.  I thought it was a bit heavy on the sugar and spice!
B00DF92E7U|5.0|Ok WOW.  I've been a fan of Kenny Wayne Shepherd since his first album as a very young man(boy), and have followed him ever since.  I even enjoyed his journey into more of a hard rock feel on &#34;The Place You're In&#34;.  This time out he teams up with Stephen Stills, and together they prove that a difference in age means nothing when it comes to putting out excellent music.  Add to the mix Barry Goldberg, and the magic can't miss...and it doesn't.  The opening song &#34;Roadhouse&#34; gets you going from the start, great vocals and guitar work.  They manage to throw in some cover songs, &#34;Search and Destroy&#34; and &#34;Rockin in the Free World&#34;, and give them their own sound, but not so much as to change the song itself.  &#34;Can't Get Enough of Loving You&#34; is perhaps my favorite song on the album, a nice slow blues ballad that doesn't disappoint on the KWS signature guitar work.  Love the whole album, and highly recommend it if you're a blues/rock fan.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great way to entertain yourself while exercising your brain. If you like cards, you will like this game.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Funny.like rhe movies. Good food, good friends and spend the day at the beach every winner after Christmas or Easter. Very verr y amusing
B000LXQVA4|3.0|This jumperoo is okay. Our daughter loves being in it for brief periods of time...5-15 minutes max. When she's in it, she loves it. At first, she didn't seem to know what to do with it, but now she's got the hang of it. The little blue elephant snaps back a little too forcefully for a baby toy, in my opinion. Though it hasn't happened yet, I can see the potential for her little fingers to get stuck between the elephant and the side bar. The dragonfly toy is super limp and just flops over, which is kind of lame.<br /><br />If you're a first time parent, invest your money in the Fisher Price Swing instead...we paid $100 for that on Amazon and it has proven to be worth EVERY penny. It's great for naps :)
B00A2H9OZS|4.0|This is the only franchise we like this actor in. Fast 5 movies are stupid and his acting in them is terrible.<br /><br />But like some other actors who totally 'fit in' perfectly in a role, Riddick is perfect for Vin Diesel. Much like Blade was for Wesley Snipes. They just have that particular character inside them, fitting like a 2nd skin.<br /><br />For the life of us, we can't figure how a pretty solid B-movie like Pitch Black was better recieved by fans than the bigger and better Chronicles of Riddick. HUH?! They wanted it dumbed down more. Complained that there were not any monsters in the sequel. We'll take style over substance any day of the week. Chronicles of Riddick was awesome, and we will state right here that it was hands down one of the best science fiction action movies ever made.<br /><br />Now, after all of these years, we finally get Riddick. We went in hoping for the best, expecting a dumbed down version that the 'fans' yelled and cried they wanted, not the story-and-character-driven and much better special effects extravaganza that Chronicles was.<br /><br />Now, after seeing and thinking over this much anticipated 3rd installment, we have come to the conclusion that it at least wasn't the pile of crap most half-assed sci-fi small budget movies come out with. (And it was surely better than all the Fast 5 movies we ever saw!)<br /><br />For what it was, (Pitch Black 2, really!), Riddick was very enjoyable. Had more laughs than most comedies, (Hangover 2 & 3 anybody!), and had TONS of creature features for the 'dumbed down' fanbase that screamed for it. The cast was good for what storyline it had. Katie Sackoff's character could have really come off much better since she has the acting chops. But for what it was, a back to B-movie basics, due to those hordes of 'stupid fans' that didn't support the bigger and much better Chronicles, director Twohy and producer/actor Vin Diesel gave us at least a fun time at the movies.<br /><br />A good pulp sci-fi action/adventure is in our blood. So, basically, we did like the film. But would have much more like to've seen a richer film in which the sequel was leading us to. LOVED the beginning. With Riddick being stranded on a very hostile and creature-filled savage world. Twohy and Vin Diesel did a solid job here. We love dogs, so to have Riddick get himself an alien pet was a major kudos for animal lovers out there. You don't see this being done in sci-fi/fantasy movies.<br /><br />I think a movie staying in this form might have been even better, just having Riddick and alien dog friend living off the harsh and brutal savage planet. Maybe running into a race of alien cannibal beings. Instead of the usual Riddick battling mercs story. And we love mercenary books and movies! (Riddick 3?) We hope so.<br /><br />We really didn't have any major issues with this new movie, until the end. The ending was not bad, but left us wanting more, especially in terms of 'proper endings' go. We loved how the director and Vin connected the 1st movie with this one, but leaving a certain bounty hunter alive was a stretch. Riddick would not have done this. Nor would the merc father. Rather would have seen everybody die except for Riddick riding off into the far off reaches of space with just Katie Sackoff.<br /><br />But, as it is, we really enjoyed the action-filled adventure of this latest Riddick. His dark humor was great. Just like the previous movies, Riddick comes up with great one-liners that don't come off as eye-rolling stupidity. We also love that Riddick doesn't pander to the PG-13 rating that most do nowadays. We expect our Riddick to be hardcore R action and sexually charged. And this one was. Thank you for sticking with that!<br /><br />Although it was dumbed down, Riddick ending up being another classic B-Movie in the best sense. Harking back to the days of pulp action heroes from Jeremiah Johnson to Conan the Barbarian. We really hope for a 4th and bigger entry in this series. It truly deserves it.
B00DGKQF2S|5.0|Great sound and some of the best rock n roll I've heard in years! Very well written songs in a mixed bag of tricks.  Lots of soul and everything from straight ahead balls out rock to heartfelt  very moving ballads.  You can't lose with these guys / this album!<br /><br />When I heard who the lineup was going to be I was expecting a bunch of over the top epic noodling.<br /><br /> Imagine my surprise when it turned out to be an entire album full of just very well done songs that are accessible to anyone.<br /><br />I hear (what should be) at least 2  big radio hits on here. In fact, the songs &#34;Elevate&#34; and &#34;I'm no angel&#34;  are both better than anything on the airwaves.<br /><br />Love it!
B000002MFE|5.0|I have always been a blues fan, but I just discovered Eric Clapton as a pure blues player.  This collection of acoustic songs is just in my wheelhouse.  I highly recommend it to blues fans out there.
B002KF2HWM|3.0|Just seemed average to me. I thought Brad Pitt did a pretty good job playing the crazy character though. The high Tech equipment used by the Panel to send him back in time seemed cheesy rather than believable.
B009NX61JY|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. It is definitely worth a second watch. It is a great romantic comedy. One of my favorites.
B00ECU2RGY|4.0|Interesting twist. Some details were not probable (i.e., sophisticated alien race not able to keep communication on dark side of earth), but over it was a good movie. Wife didn't think it was that good, but she doesn't like science fiction.

B00AZMFK3K|1.0|Star Trek: Into Darkness is a solid film and a worthy follow up to 2009's Brilliant Star Trek reboot. But to offer fans a blu-ray release with no extra features... is just plain insulting. If you want bonus features, you've got to shell out $55 for the bonus content included in the \\"Special Collector's Edition\\"... and even then, you don't get it all!! Not even a commentary track!!<br /><br />You don't mess with your fans... especially when it comes to Star Trek! What was Paramount Home Video thinking?!!
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I loved the plots around all the different characters. Although some characters were a bit preachy I guess that was deliberate.  So that we could have different shades within hero vs antihero plot points.
B008XLFG66|4.0|This story of Charlie and Marlin going to a new pet shop in there small town. They were so excited  to have one, since the closet one was a ways away. Mr.Elmer Jacks the owner of the pet shop carries all sorts of animals and tells the two boys he at times travels to Central America to find new animals for his store. The boys look around with smiles and are so excited to see all the different types of reptiles, cats, puppies, spiders (yikes) and they stumble upon one glass case that held a unique turtle. This was no ordinary turtle, from first sight the turtle was looking back at Charlie with bright jade green eyes. He asked if he was for sale, but Mr. Jacks told the he wasn't for sale. Which got his interest why? He really liked this turtle and came back to the pet shop after school just to check him out again. One day when he went to buy a hamster, it got loose but that wasn't the only thing that got loose. The turtle was stolen by the school bully who follow Charlie into the pet shop to just start trouble. Well that turtle was trouble alright.It was the start of bad events when he was stolen.<br /> Now to really find out what sort of trouble this turtle causes the small town, you have to read it. I am an adult and I was captivated in the story line. This is a good read for youth 13 yrs and older.. it is a short read, so you won't be reading a huge novel but you will be done before you know it. It is a good read. I like it.<br /><br />I received this in exchanged for an honest review.

B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Great movie, how could you go wrong with Bruce Willis and now his son grown up. Wowie Great Movie., glad I watched it.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|My granddaughter loves this movie. It is fantastic. I heartily recommend it .I will probably need to purchase it<br />- it is that good!
B00498YZH8|4.0|It was very well written story for the place and time and boy what a topic. Actors were very good in it, very dramatic.

B00DXP7L88|3.0|Over the years I have noticed that most TV shows seem to start weakening a bit after 7 seasons.<br />This is not a criticism of the writers, I simply think it is difficult to keep an interesting flow going with a given set of characters and general premise.<br /><br />Dexter is no different.<br />I am writing this review with only 2 episodes left in the Series Finale.<br />(I will most likely need to update when the DVD ships to make comments on that aspect of it).<br /><br />Dexter Season 8 starts very good, but fades from mid season on to close to absurd.<br />However the acting is superb.<br /><br />BUT .... you can feel the writers were struggling to wrap up the Dexter universe and as a result the general storyline feels a bit \\"forced\\" this season.<br /><br />I don't want to risk writing any spoilers, but some of Dexter's decisions don't seem in character and are more to help end the story arc.<br /><br />The re-appearance of some older characters from past seasons also seem to lack continuity as past events are easily dismissed or ignored in the new relationships that are formed.<br /><br />There are some plot holes that are unusual for the clever writing that has historically been part of this show.<br /><br />It seems at times that character personalities have been changed to forcibly fit this SERIES FINALE.<br /><br />You will note that despite this, I still gave a 3` Star review.<br /><br />You get the feeling the writers were starting to run out of ideas and may have been happy to end the series now instead of being challenged to keep the quality high for another 2,3,4+ seasons. That or they were fighting with each other on how to end the series and never came to a good agreement.<br /><br />Everybody likes to go out on a high note.<br />A boxer wants to retire stilling holding the title.<br />A TV show likes to say goodbye when the quality is still high and the ratings are still good.<br /><br />It is unpleasant and sometimes sad to see something outlive it's quality of life.<br /><br />Personally I hate to see DEXTER leave the air.<br />My wife and I have really liked the characters.<br />So I might personally like to see DEXTER go on and on \\"forever\\".<br /><br />But the logical part of my mind understands why it is probably artistically best for the show to exit now while it is still riding high and not die a whimpering death of mediocrity.<br /><br />As it is, the last few episodes suffer from some bad writing and very, very illogical actions on the part of Dexter that are not believable, make no sense, and seem to just be an excuse to create problems for our characters.<br /><br />I won't say too much except it is the same old ..........\\"Dexter hesitates doing what he knows is the smart thing to do and somebody suffers \\"........  plot device they have used in 5 of the 8 seasons.<br />But this time, it is so badly and obviously used many fans will say the show \\"jumped the shark\\".<br /><br />All in all -- I don't want to criticize the hard work and great acting talents that go into making a show like this , BUT ..... Dexter should have had a better written season for his final farewell.it's quality of life.<br /><br />Personally I hate to see DEXTER leave the air.<br />My wife and I have really liked the characters.<br />So I might personally like to see DEXTER go on and on \\"forever\\".<br /><br />But the logical part of my mind understands why it is probably artistically best for the show to exit now while it is still riding high and not die a whimpering death of mediocrity.<br /><br />As it is, the last few episodes suffer from some bad writing and very, very illogical actions on the part of Dexter that are not believable, make no sense, and seem to just be an excuse to create problems for our characters.<br /><br />I won't say too much except it is the same old ..........\\"Dexter hesitates doing what he knows is the smart thing to do and somebody suffers \\"........  plot device they have used in 5 of the 8 seasons.<br />But this time, it is so badly and obviously used many fans will say the show \\"jumped the shark\\".<br /><br />All in all -- I don't want to criticize the hard work and great acting talents that go into making a show like this , BUT .....

B004HWYTP4|5.0|This movie is not to be taken seriously. Enjoy it for a cheesy action flick and you will have fun.
B0047SIXGE|5.0|Redux is the definitive version and the Kindle Fire H.D. product is amazing; it's so sharp it looks like it was filmed yesterday. I haven't seen the theatrical version in years because it just doesn't approach the level of horror (oh, the horror!) of the newer Redux edit. This is a genuine masterpiece of filmmaking. It's disturbing and should make us all think about the futility of getting mixed up in foreign civil wars.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|And it hits the mark.  It's basically a disaster film, with the ships, planet and people being torn up Transformers style.  Vapid &#34;twists&#34; relate to the original Wrath of Khan.  High in the old Star Trek films was the credit for science advisor or consultant.  The ridiculous inaccuracies with the physics of this film make it difficult for any science inclined person to watch.  It's awfully windy in space!  And the earth has a gravitational pull similar to a black hole.  Turn off your brain and it is an entertaining film.  If you're looking for something that has entertainment value AND depth, this is not your film. I want to like these films.  The writing just won't let me.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I am not usually a fan of series books but this is a good one. I can't wait to read the next book. It does start off a little slow and doesn't have the same \\"page turning ability\\" as hunger games, but still worth reading. I love the characters in this series. Excellent character development without being boring and overbearing.  I am so glad it didn't turn into a sappy love story. You really must read this book if you have read hunger games. I recommend this second book.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|Love this game if you didn't have to wait for energy it would be perfect, even so love it very hard to put down
B00C5R8364|5.0|Reading Mr. Forsyth's books is always a pleasure. The kill list is not different. Straightforward writing and an intriguing and intelligent assembled history. I do recommend it.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Star Trek into Darkness was well worth the watch.  It ties in elements of the older pre-time warp shows.  I mean bring Khan back could not have been cooler.  A new character joins the crew/family aboard Enterprise which I am sure will be an improved role in the next episode of Star Trek Saga.  I could not believe a major role player got killed off again for the good of the many.  I am your friend.  But fear not, bold go, watch it.

B0081SKYDG|1.0|This is a detestable movie with no redeeming value. The list of reasons to hate this movie could go on for pages. It is not even worth fully writing a review. I am usually a firm believer in \\"different strokes for different folks\\" when it comes to liking movies, but this? It was hateful, sociopathic behavior being rewarded on nearly every level and being glorified in a lazy, spiteful movie with little to no sense of scale, and absolutely no self awareness.<br /><br />\\"Project X\\" is a series of set pieces ripped off from one news story and about a hundred inexpressibly superior \\"coming of age\\" and \\"party\\" films from the last 4 decades. This movie directly steals from those other films by rote, but has no idea what the source material means. At least in those other movies there was a sense that the characters had reasons for their actions on some basic level or had grown as characters, if only minimally, by the end of the film. There were story arcs and plots. This just goes from one idiotic glorification of excess to the next without giving us a reason to care how it fits in with the overall story. Probably because there was no real story or plot. No one learns anything. No one grows. Nothing really happens even though literally everything was shoved onto the screen. Even the father of the main character practically pats him on the back for doing what probably amounts to millions in property damage and for committing local, state, and federal crimes because even the adults seem to think \\"popularity at any price\\" is a justifiable end in itself.<br /><br />If you are one of the people who thought this movie was enjoyable and are planning to emulate its events, enjoy your prison sentence and the many, many other bad life choices you will inevitably make.

B00BVYNSLC|5.0|Orphan Black as a TV series has a lot of things going for it.  The premise of the show is quite novel/very entertaining, interesting, even if you're not in to sci-fi  and . The plot lines are intriguing, well developed yet fast paced.  The storytelling is extraordinary and the writing is smart. There is a rich cinema look & feel and attention to detail about the production, yet those are not the reasons I'd strongly recommend that you really must watch Orphan Black.<br /><br />Oh by the way the supporting cast members are just brillant, some of the best ever, but that's still not the basis for this \\"kind-o-have to' recommendation...<br /><br />No, the reason this is a MUST WATCH TV show is the acting... specifically the acting by the lead actress... and the acting by the 4-5 other major supporting actresses.  These actors are all FANTASTIC and they all are highly worthy of being considered as the best actors in any series... ever!  BTW, all those actresses are all Tatiana Maslany! .... in multiple roles.... sometimes trying to act as if she is one character acting as another character....  who hold onto slight nuances of the first character yet gives a believable try as being one another.  Are you getting this yet?  Multiple well-defined characters with distinct personalities, accents... the whole nine, who have complex interactions with one another...  5-6 richly developed and empathetic characters  ...same actress.  Are you getting this yet?  Tatiana Maslany!  She was NOT nominated for the best actress Emmy!  Tatiana Maslany!  Are you getting this yet?  See Orphan Black!

B00AEFXEN6|2.0|This is a review *specifically* for the Sapphire Series Blu Ray edition of American Beauty.  This is one of my favorite movies of all time, but this production run seems to be physically scratched and damaged with some consistency.<br /><br />The first copy I received had a damaged case even though the package it was shipped in appeared undamaged, and the disc was scratched.  The replacement copy had an undamaged case, but the disc had several scratches.  That's when I gave up and just took the refund.<br /><br />I would recommend waiting until they get their quality control problems under control to purchase the Blu Ray, but make sure to get a copy from your local library or whatnot in the meantime so you don't miss out on this wonderful film.

Read Wool 1-5 in one sitting and can't wait to get online to read the next book.

I will persevere and get another fix of the Silo Saga!!!

1601251505|5.0|The Pathfinder Core Rulebook contains a wealth of information for players and Dungeon Masters/Game Masters.  This nearly 600 page tome expands upon the foundation that 3rd edition Dungeons and Dragons (and 3.5 edition later) started and tweaks, fixes or adds elements that make the game fantastic to run or play.  The book itself is hardcover and made of high quality materials.  I've had my copy for several years now and have used it extensively, and while the cover has some wear and tear, the pages have not ripped nor smudged and the spine is still perfectly in tact.  Each page is easy to read and the background fits the theme perfectly.  The illustrations and art are of the highest quality and I must say I really do like the style the artists and developer's choose.  Not everyone will be happy, I'm sure, as it's a bit more stylized than the previous edition, but that shouldn't stop anyone from picking this up if they're looking for rulebook that's perfect for a single adventure completed in a night, or one that spans years.<br /><br />Each chapter is worth reading, but can easily be thumbed through to find exactly what you're looking for.  Below I'll go through what you can expect to find in this book.  Each chapter begins with an illustration and a few paragraphs explaining what's happening to the iconics (characters created by Paizo, one for each class with a unique backstory) in that panel.  These help set the mood for roleplay!<br /><br />Chapter 1: Getting Started<br />This chapter contains information about what Pathfinder is, what's needed to play the game, and how basic play goes.  It provides an overview for each chapter and a list of common terms (like what a saving throw is).  It also lists steps for a novice player on how to create a character and an explanation of each ability score.<br /><br />Chapter 2: Races<br />Seven core races are detailed: dwarves, elves, gnomes, half-elves, half-orcs, halflings, and humans.  It lists some basic information regarding each race for flavor including physical descriptions, society, and names.  At the bottom are the racial abilities and modifiers for each race for character creation.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Classes<br />This is the heart of the book.  11 classes are included: Barbarian, Bard, Cleric, Druid, Fighter, Monk, Paladin, Ranger, Rogue, Sorcerer and Wizard.  Each class includes some background information, a picture of the Pathfinder iconic that represents that class, the class' role in a party, and all the information needed to generate the character as well as what the class benefits are gained each level.  Also briefly detailed is how to advance a character and how Multiclassing (taking levels in more than one class) works.  One of the improvements Paizo made is that each class has something new every level, whether that is a new ability or spell.<br /><br />Each class also receives new abilities, each adding flavor to that specific class.<br />-Barbarians get Rage Powers, which give them bonuses or allow them to perform special actions while raging.<br />-Bards receive new thematic bonuses, like substituting a performance skill check for something else (like diplomacy).  They also receive their bardic performances quicker and get new performances.<br />-Clerics receive two domains that let them customize their spells, but also grants boons at different levels, usually in the form of an extra ability at level 1 and 8.  In addition, the way that clerics heal have been overhauled.  They can now \\"channel\\" positive energy to heal allies or damage undead (have to choose which, can't do both!) or the opposite with channeling negative energy.  Good alignments channel positive, evil channels negative, and neutral can choose which, but once chosen can't switch.  This means Clerics do not have to worry about spending spell slots to cast cure spells all the time!<br />-Druid is largely unchanged, though their wild shape has been spaced out more.  They make up for this in havinga much more powerful animal companion that grows in power each level, rather than every 3 levels, and they can choose any animal at level 1.  They can also choose to take a cleric domain from a smaller list that grants them the associated powers and boons.<br />-Fighters still get their wealth of bonus feats (so a feat every level), but they also get weapon and armor bonuses on their odd levels, allowing them to specialize and grow more proficient/powerful with a set of weapons and making armor less cumbersome.<br />-Monk is given a new ability, stunning fist, where they can try to stun their opponent.  In addition, Ki Strike has been replaced by Ki Pool, allowing them a number of points that can be expended to perform amazing feats.<br />-Paladin has turn undead replace with a cleric's channel positive energy feature.  Remove disease has been replaced with Mercies that are powerful abilities that are activated with lay on hands that remove conditions, like fatigue and at higher levels diseases and poisons.  Also, the paladin has a choice of a special mount or having a special bound weapon that has a number of useful enhancements that can be activated.<br />-Rangers have been given favored terrains that increase a number of skills and abilities in a particular environment.  One is gained every 3 levels. In addition, they a choice of an animal companion at 4th level, using a smaller subset of the list the druids get.  (Personally, I'm not a fan of this and believe the Ranger should have the full list considering their companion is already weaker...).  The ranger can elect not to take an animal companion and instead form a bond with his companions, allowing him to share his favored enemy bonus with them.<br />-Rogues receive rogue talents, which allow them to pick up many useful skills and abilities.  These range from bonuses to skills, allowing the rogue to make skill checks faster, to even allowing them access to low level spells.  They are varied and allow for a great wealth of customization.<br />-Sorcerer has been overhauled greatly, as has the Wizard.  A sorcerer picks an associated \\"Bloodline\\" where their power comes from.  This gives them an ability at first level, and additional abilities as they increase in level.  It also provides them with additional class skills and bonus spells every level.  This means that a sorcerer has more abilities to use throughout the day without worrying about spending all their spells and having nothing left to do.  This is a great addition<br />-Wizard receives a much needed overhaul as well.  Before, once a wizard went through their small allotment of daily spells, they had nothing left to do (except maybe fire a ranged weapon or hide).  They start by picking a familiar or a bonded item.  The item allows them to cast one spell they already had prepared that day.  Wizards pick an arcane school that grants them bonuses for their school (and penalties for their opposed school).  These include abilities that can be activated at first level and unlock other abilities at later levels.  For instance, an Evoker wizard has their evocation spells do more damage, and at first level can unleash a number of force missiles per day that does not count against a spell limit (these have a separate limit of usage).  At level 8, the Wizard can create a wall of energy that damages foes.  These give the Wizard many more options and keep them in play much longer than before.<br /><br />Overall, the additions are fantastic and give each class some useful boon or ability every level so the classes never feel dull or stale.  Each class also gets a capstone ability at level 20 that represents an ultimate ability for that class (giving a player a reason to level up a single class).<br /><br />Chapter 4: Skills<br />Each class has access to every skill.  Some skills still need to be trained (that is, a character has to put a \\"rank\\", or skill point towards a particular skill) to be used.  Instead of the previous edition of D&D, Pathfinder simplified the skill system: a character can have a maximum of their character level in ranks put into any one skill.  For example, a 5th level Cleric could have 5 \\"ranks\\" invested in Climb, but not 6 because that's higher than the character level.  Also, each class has \\"Class Skills\\".  If a player puts a rank into a skill their class has, they receive a +3 to that skill.  Each class determines how many skill ranks a player has to spend.  There are 35 skills in all allowing opening up flexibility and diversity.<br /><br />Chapter 5: Feats<br />Feats allow characters to take special actions, grants them boosts to their ability, or give them some kind of boon that's not normally available.  There are a wide assortment of feats to help each character and class be unique and play the way that is desired.  For instance, a fighter could wield a bow and take Mounted Combat feats to allow them to fire while atop a horse (or other animal).  Or, they could take feats that enhance their damage with large weapons to be an absolute powerhouse.  Some combinations work better than others, and some feats have pre-requisites the character must meet, like a minimum ability score, a particular class feature, or even a different feat that must be taken.<br /><br />Chapter 6: Equipment<br />No adventurer would be complete without their trusted equipment.  This chapter contains weapons, armors, and all kinds of mundane, useful items like backpacks and torches.  Also in this section are the prices for common services like an inn or passage on a water faring vessel.  Many of the items have an illustration and each has a description.  Also there are charts for easy reference to weight, size, damage, armor bonus, etc.<br /><br />Chapter 7: Additional Rules<br />This chapter contains the various rules that are important for playing, such as each player's weight allowance or encumbrance, alignment descriptions, movement, and visibility.<br /><br />Chapter 8: Combat<br />To arms!  This chapter details how combat works, what each person can do on their move, what is allowed, what actions can be performed, and special combat maneuvers.  Pathfinder simplified the combat maneuvers from the previous addition.  Each character has a combat maneuver bonus (CMB) and a combat maneuver defense (CMD), both of which are static numbers that increase as the player levels up.  A player decides on a combat maneuver to perform (such as a bull rush) and in order to succeed, they roll and add their CMB and compare it to the enemy's CMD.  If it's higher, the maneuver succeeds, otherwise it fails and the action is wasted.<br /><br />Chapter 9: Magic<br />This chapter explains how to cast spells, what happens during spell casting or when a character is interrupted, and learning new spells to cast.<br /><br />Chapter 10: Spells<br />This lengthy chapter has a short reference list of each spell at each level for each class.  After this are the spells themselves, with flavor description, the rules for casting the spell, and an explanation for each spell's effect.  Any spellcaster will want to bookmark this section!<br /><br />Chapter 11: Prestige Classes<br />After fulfilling certain requirements, a character may be eligible to take levels in a prestige class; a specialized class that offers unique and powerful abilities.  This is essentially multiclassing.  This chapter describes each prestige class just as the Chapter 3 did for the core classes.  Classes include the Assassin, Arcane Trickster, Duelist, and Mystic Theurge to name a few.<br /><br />Chapter 12: Gamemastering<br />This chapter gives advice on how to run, prepare, and setup a Pathfinder game.  Included are how to award experience points, build encounters, and distributing treasures.<br /><br />Chapter 13: Environment<br />As it sounds, this chapter deals with the various environment the player may encounter in the game, which may be just as deadly as any enemy they encounter.  This includes, deserts, dungeons, forests, mountains, urban/cities and several more, as well as the various weather players may encounter.<br /><br />Chapter 14: Creating NPCs (Non-Player Characters)<br />Whether a game master needs a villain to terrorize the players, an associate to help them in a pinch, or just an inn keeper to take their gold, this chapter explains all that is needed to create NPCs including simple classes for NPCs, creating statistics quickly, outfitting them, and determining how much of a challenge they may pose to the players.<br /><br />Chapter 15: Magic Items<br />This chapter details the wondrous items the players will ultimately desire to find and use in their adventures.  Basic information regarding magic items, a random generation table, the various abilities that can be enchanted or found on magic items, magic armors, weapons, staffs, rods, wands, rings and items.  There is likely something for everyone in here, and if there isn't, this section also details how to create magic items so players can craft their own fantastical gear.<br /><br />The rest of the book is the appendices for quick reference.  It is well organized and extremely useful.<br /><br />In order to start playing, only two other items are necessary: a set of dice and a copy of the bestiary.  This is not a solo game, however, and two people are needed to play.<br /><br />If you're new to tabletop RPGs, or looking for a new home, this is a great, well developed and supported product to pick.  If you're a fan of D&D 3rd edition (or 3.5) you will feel at home with the rules.  Even better, all your old supplements can easily be used with Pathfinder.<br /><br />This product is a 5/5 for me.  The love and care that Paizo took in creating Pathfinder is obvious, not only with the quality of this book, but with the way they interact with their community.  The character creation is versatile and limitless; each class can be customized for a unique playstyle.  The rules are streamlined and simple (though sometimes questions do come up on how to solve some complex interaction).  But most of all, the game I loved is back and better than ever.  I highly recommend Pathfinder to anyone looking for a great tabletop experience.  If you don't have a group to play with, look for a game store that hosts \\"Pathfinder Society\\" where you can have organized gaming sessions (and potentially find a group to play with!).tion of D&D, Pathfinder simplified the skill system: a character can have a maximum of their character level in ranks put into any one skill.  For example, a 5th level Cleric could have 5 \\"ranks\\" invested in Climb, but not 6 because that's higher than the character level.  Also, each class has \\"Class Skills\\".  If a player puts a rank into a skill their class has, they receive a +3 to that skill.  Each class determines how many skill ranks a player has to spend.  There are 35 skills in all allowing opening up flexibility and diversity.<br /><br />Chapter 5: Feats<br />Feats allow characters to take special actions, grants them boosts to their ability, or give them some kind of boon that's not normally available.  There are a wide assortment of feats to help each character and class be unique and play the way that is desired.  For instance, a fighter could wield a bow and take Mounted Combat feats to allow them to fire while atop a horse (or other animal).  Or, they could take feats that enhance their damage with large weapons to be an absolute powerhouse.  Some combinations work better than others, and some feats have pre-requisites the character must meet, like a minimum ability score, a particular class feature, or even a different feat that must be taken.<br /><br />Chapter 6: Equipment<br />No adventurer would be complete without their trusted equipment.  This chapter contains weapons, armors, and all kinds of mundane, useful items like backpacks and torches.  Also in this section are the prices for common services like an inn or passage on a water faring vessel.  Many of the items have an illustration and each has a description.  Also there are charts for easy reference to weight, size, damage, armor bonus, etc.<br /><br />Chapter 7: Additional Rules<br />This chapter contains the various rules that are important for playing, such as each player's weight allowance or encumbrance, alignment descriptions, movement, and visibility.<br /><br />Chapter 8: Combat<br />To arms!  This chapter details how combat works, what each person can do on their move, what is allowed, what actions can be performed, and special combat maneuvers.  Pathfinder simplified the combat maneuvers from the previous addition.  Each character has a combat maneuver bonus (CMB) and a combat maneuver defense (CMD), both of which are static numbers that increase as the player levels up.  A player decides on a combat maneuver to perform (such as a bull rush) and in order to succeed, they roll and add their CMB and compare it to the enemy's CMD.  If it's higher, the maneuver succeeds, otherwise it fails and the action is wasted.<br /><br />Chapter 9: Magic<br />This chapter explains how to cast spells, what happens during spell casting or when a character is interrupted, and learning new spells to cast.<br /><br />Chapter 10: Spells<br />This lengthy chapter has a short reference list of each spell at each level for each class.  After this are the spells themselves, with flavor description, the rules for casting the spell, and an explanation for each spell's effect.  Any spellcaster will want to bookmark this section!<br /><br />Chapter 11: Prestige Classes<br />After fulfilling certain requirements, a character may be eligible to take levels in a prestige class; a specialized class that offers unique and powerful abilities.  This is essentially multiclassing.  This chapter describes each prestige class just as the Chapter 3 did for the core classes.  Classes include the Assassin, Arcane Trickster, Duelist, and Mystic Theurge to name a few.<br /><br />Chapter 12: Gamemastering<br />This chapter gives advice on how to run, prepare, and setup a Pathfinder game.  Included are how to award experience points, build encounters, and distributing treasures.<br /><br />Chapter 13: Environment<br />As it sounds, this chapter deals with the various environment the player may encounter in the game, which may be just as deadly as any enemy they encounter.  This includes, deserts, dungeons, forests, mountains, urban/cities and several more, as well as the various weather players may encounter.<br /><br />Chapter 14: Creating NPCs (Non-Player Characters)<br />Whether a game master needs a villain to terrorize the players, an associate to help them in a pinch, or just an inn keeper to take their gold, this chapter explains all that is needed to create NPCs including simple classes for NPCs, creating statistics quickly, outfitting them, and determining how much of a challenge they may pose to the players.<br /><br />Chapter 15: Magic Items<br />This chapter details the wondrous items the players will ultimately desire to find and use in their adventures.  Basic information regarding magic items, a random generation table, the various abilities that can be enchanted or found on magic items, magic armors, weapons, staffs, rods, wands, rings and items.  There is likely something for everyone in here, and if there isn't, this section also details how to create magic items so players can craft their own fantastical gear.<br /><br />The rest of the book is the appendices for quick reference.  It is well organized and extremely useful.<br /><br />In order to start playing, only two other items are necessary: a set of dice and a copy of the bestiary.  This is not a solo game, however, and two people are needed to play.<br /><br />If you're new to tabletop RPGs, or looking for a new home, this is a great, well developed and supported product to pick.  If you're a fan of D&D 3rd edition (or 3.5) you will feel at home with the rules.  Even better, all your old supplements can easily be used with Pathfinder.<br /><br />This product is a 5/5 for me.  The love and care that Paizo took in creating Pathfinder is obvious, not only with the quality of this book, but with the way they interact with their community.  The character creation is versatile and limitless; each class can be customized for a unique playstyle.  The rules are streamlined and simple(though sometimes questions do come up on how to solve some complex interaction).  But most of all, the game I loved is back and better than ever.  I highly recommend Pathfinder to anyone looking for a great tabletop experience.  If you don't have a group to play with, look for a game store that hosts \\"Pathfinder Society\\" where you can have organized gaming sessions (and potentially find a group to play with!).
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|Although all the actors were great, the story jumps around in time so much it's hard to follow.  So it's just ok.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|We love them all in this series.The kids and the adults love to play this one.  Good choice. for all.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|A totally great film.  It has action but also a great story.  Denzel knows how to pick his films.  Loved every minute of it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Love them all in this series.Kids and adults. Fun to play.Have fun playing for the whole family. Good choice for all.
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|Sorry but neither my spouse nor I could sit through this film to the end.  It bored us to death and got no better.  I don't think we bothered watching it all the way to the ending.  Just moved too slowly. Too bad, we were looking forward to seeing a film about this subject.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|I really like this book.  Glad I downloaded it.  A lot of information that to me is very interesting.  A1
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Best Bond film thus far.  Daniel Craig is by far the best Bond and there have been many great Bond actors.  Story was great and a great ride from beginning to end.  Action-adventure great but also great story.  Superbly done.
B009NX61JY|5.0|Perfectly delightful!  Two sexy, wonderful actors, Streisand genius and music.  Perfect viewing when you want to escape to a fun fantasy. I've seen it twice before and will continue watching it a couple of times a year.  I'll probably end up buying the video.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Even though Bourne is not in this film, he is just spoken of, it's still a Bourne film.  It carries on with the same story line but with a different main character, played by Renner.  Renner is superb actor.  Seen him in films and tv. The guy is like a chameleon so is perfect for any Bourne film. Superb film, action, adventure & story line as well.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|It was a saga and an involved write requiring interest in the characters and the ability to shift gears without losing interest.  But they were complicated times.  So well written but a more sophisticated read and one requiring interest in places, times and<br />experiences outside this country.  Enjoyed the experience of this read.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Great film for any Star Trek fan.  It took me a little while to &#34;get into it&#34; but that is common with any film.  Love Benedict Cumberbatch in it too though wish we saw more of him in it.  Loved him in the modern Sherlock Holmes series on PBS via the BBC.  He's such a great actor, just wanted to see more of his character in the film.  Otherwise, it's great.
B00B2JSRAS|2.0|I don't know if this book proves anything, and it was a bit fluffy.  I think it's more important for one to understand their perspective before they understand what manifesting really means.
B00COGZ8FU|5.0|As most Cruise films are action-adventure.  This is in the same genre.  It's a great action adventure film, fun, entertaining, etc.  Just know that if you watch it, it's kind of the same ol' Cruise film as any other.  If you like that, you will like this.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love this. Easy to use. Does lots of things. Fits the kindle perfectly. Keeps track of each number rather than lumping them all together.
B00F35BV64|5.0|was a good show hope they make more it kept my interest for a change good action and suspense and drama
B0037Z8SLI|5.0|Got some great learnings out of this book. I recommend it to anyone that has to manage complex tasks or projects.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Best trilogy in quite some time. Great story of survival, love, and hope. Looking forward to reading more books by Suzanne Collins.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Amazing. This book is many things to many people. I expected there to be a surprise ending. : ) Yet, the politics of the stories and characters was perfectly orchestrated to have only one obvious end. It is worth the read. Especially, the parts where forgiving oneself for the errors made in childhood are evoked a few times over. If one can think that introspectively, it may be exactly what one needs to see or hear.
B009NQZVKG|3.0|Can be a little hokey at times and the sigma guys have nine lives. That said, very fun and interesting read. Very cool subject matter.
B009ZQJVAK|4.0|Good British sense of humor around a whimsical but true story.  It's a feel good movie that keeps you rooting for the underdog
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|fun game great graphics easy to play can challenge you sometimes when trying to beat a level the only thing is it has a tendency to freeze
B00AM1RG0Y|5.0|Duck the spoilers if you want . . .<br /><br />Directed by Oliver Stone, with John Travolta in a very un-Travolta role, with more action, scary adventure, morality lessons, R-rated sex, a true rendition of the ups and eventual downs of 'benign' grass. With elegant to horrific production values, it's among the most entertaining and engrossing movie I've seen this year. Could be, ever. A real education, too.<br /><br />SAVAGES' plot slams us from gritty to gorgeous, scary to sexy, beautiful to bloody.<br /><br />Maybe spoilers: A trio of young, beautiful California types, two young men and a beautiful woman, all smart, materialistic,<br />charming and imaginative, discover a way to make and sell dynamite marijuana - cannabis, grass, MJ. Their lives are beautiful. They become millionaires. But when a Mexican drug cartel discovers these 'kids' are overwhelming competition, then come  blood reigns.<br /><br />All out war begins between blood-thirsty drug lords and the beach<br />boys and girl California sellers. Okay, enough spoilers already.<br /><br />To talk quality, the production is wonderful, sharp, extravagant, very California vistas, looks, action, color, talk.<br />I hone in on dialogue - the script never goes flat. The action is believably driven by sharp reparte`, vicious drug lord threats. Paradise is blown to hell. All, beautifully. Except for the gallons of blood, brains and bones shattered and splattered.<br /><br />Not for family viewing. More for young adults with a strong message<br />that money isn't worth possible dangers, pain and inevitable losses.<br /><br />I study movies, so I've seen SAVAGES three times, examining all elements, from words to pictures to the psychology of greed, the motivation of gimme-more mentalities. Overall, with extremes of bliss and vicious unexpected costs, SAVAGES is very-much a mind blower.  (And not, this isn't a cautionary tale. It's just intensely real)<br /><br />Have you seen Johnny Depp's BLOW?[[ASIN:B0091W9GQM Blow [HD]]] . . . Cotton Candy,  rather sweet and mild compared to the gritty, beautifully and horribly real SAVAGES. Just think a Hemingway quote: \\"The check always comes\\".
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|It never let you go... Action from the beginning to the end, I worn out my chair, exciting? I guess you can say that!!!
B00AZMFJYA|2.0|The movie itself reflects little of the promo spots. There were references, but off, to prior original Star Trek episodes. The plot was jumbled and scrambled. All attention was paid to CGI and space action.<br />In all, a disappointing mess. I vasty prefer the character development/interaction, the humor and clarity  of New Generation; even the now-deemed corny original Star Trek. I HATE dinging ANY Star Trek venture, especially Picard & Company. Oh, re the comment on the Shatner version - I have the BLU-Ray complete original season. It's great. Audio and video really make a difference, even with Golden Oldies! Maybe especially with Golden Oldies...<br /><br />The JJ Abrams' vision seems too disco, flashy without content other than gizmo<br />gimmicks. I sure hope another attempt is made; changes are certainly necessary.<br /><br />One question: This release was changed several times, and this last version seems to be inconsistent.<br />Were there disagreement's in story/character directions? INTO DARKNESS seems a collision of<br />different views, philosophies. And many comment that promos and final film convey almost a whole other<br />film. Any comments, agreement?<br /><br />(One virtue: This DARKNESS almost had a tribble involved. Only almost, though)
B005HSG3TC|3.0|Wish the band was tighter so I could use it to hold on to at night when reading in bed. But....
B00EMJD6TC|5.0|Brad pit was excellent!  It was not the normal zombie movie .  Great military scenes awesome suspense when I watched it in the theater two older women jumped right out of there seats!!! Awsome
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Have patience. A fun way to pass the time. Pretty addictive.  Again, have patience or spend money out of pocket.
B00ARF93AQ|5.0|Far different from the original horrible movie with Sylvester Stallone .  Much better story line.  Much better action scenes keeps you watching
B00E38KGF4|4.0|My Kindle Fire HD got a virus so I immediately got sum protection and I haven't had any problem since I guess it's acceptable. I especially like how it scans it downloads as soon as u buy them. Hopefully I don't have to fear any virus again. :)
B002BU0DPE|5.0|best headset I have ever had so fare im very inpresed yeah and on tht point don't think about it just do it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|One of the best series ever! Even if you're &#34;zombie'd out&#34;, give Walking Dead a chance to change your mind!
B009GEAWOU|5.0|season 8 was really good. the group getting use to  Marshall and Lily having a baby  is quite interesting. all in all season 8 its very good.
B004D9FLJE|5.0|An absolute must for all serious Glee fans!! How it all started.....follow it along, be part of the story.....serious Glee roots!
B00005JNS0|5.0|While the action is probably right on the verge for what my child can process (without being TOO stimulating) cars is a great family flick and my daughter wants to watch it every day.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Has daily and weekly info at your fingertips. Very useful and informative. You can drill down on several pages for hourly info. Radar is great! Highly recommend this app.
0763644765|5.0|My daughter and I enjoyed reading this over and over while she was potty-training.  It is a cute book with good illustrations!
0679805273|5.0|I bought two of this books for my boys to have their teachers sign it and I will give it to them as a graduation gift !
1490313370|5.0|Since I am an entrepreneur, I'm always looking to learn and improve.  Well, isn't everyone?  I learned about this book since I have been reading James' tweets and blog for some time, and always felt inspired and also like there was a ring of truth with what he is saying - he cuts through the crap (pardon my language) of business,  sales, investing, social media and business-building.  There is a lot of practical, actionable and inspirational wisdom in this book.  Buy it, read it and pass it on.  This is on my Top 10 read of 2013.  It's first on my list for people who want to start a business.
B00466HM28|5.0|This is an awesome product I love the way that it is so compact you can take it pretty much any where with your laptop and make some cool music on the go.
B005MMY9A8|2.0|The story was alright but needs a lot of improvement! The acting was a little dull and could use some improvement
B00CBRH4YU|5.0|Malik's recent films are a meditation on life.  He hides nothing.  The film is beautiful because life is beautiful.  If you want a cold hard look at love, rent this movie and see this couple's story.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|So far, it's been a great cover. The kindle fire snaps perfectly in it and I don't have any trouble accessing the charger port. The red is stylish. Not too bright.
B005544TRQ|2.0|If I were a Harvard graduate, I'd sue - unless, of course, I only know four letter words. None of the characters is particularly likable and they all seem to gravitate toward third grade bathroom humor. I say bathroom because every tenth word is, like this show, full of s***.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I did not want to read these books, I usually do not enjoy books in a series, but this is an outstanding book. The plot line is an old one but the author weaves her characters into new twists and surprises on the good vs evil theme.<br />I would recommend this book, I was on a three week vacation and had it on my Ipad and had to order the other two.
B008BQ8YHQ|2.0|In fourth grade, my vocabulary was better than the script for this show gives its characters. We could save so many trees if they deleted the four letter, meaningless words.
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|The whole family watches this show and we all love it. We have an eight year old and five year old. It's their favorite show.
B008JF8O9M|4.0|I downloaded this app along with another printer app just so I could print occasionally from my Kindle Fire. NO LUCK. Neither program works. E PTINT does not work as I read in the review s that it is not compatible with Kindle Fire. Print bot does not list my HP photosmart C6350 printer in the printer choices. Now I do not know how to delete these apps from my Kindle.<br />Thanks,<br />Sharon Patterson-Turner
B005544TRQ|5.0|This season is excellent! It grabs you. Now I'm working on finishing the second season. This is similar to other shows you would normally find on the USA network.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|Amazing show. This show is captivating and so well done. I love the actors that play the different judges. This season is the best one yet
1452126577|5.0|If you need a laugh and like cats, this is your book!  Grumpy has a great sense of &#34;get lost&#34; fun.  Loved his crossword puzzle!  Great gift for anyone who is cat-a-tonic.
0765326353|5.0|I found Brandon Sanderson via the Wheel of Time. I have enjoyed every single book and this series is outstanding.  Look online after for deeper understanding of his books and the universe they belong in.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|We watched this movie because it had FOUR STARS.  Seriously, those five and four star rankers are smoking crack.  Really lame movie. The plot was disjointed, the character development non-existent and \\"twist\\" was really....dumb. Seriously.  Don't waste your time with this one.
B00EQ0CKRQ|2.0|I tried to like this game but had a really hard time to play it as easy as a lto of the other race game I have tried
B00EVCD9HY|5.0|Amazingly real music! Can't stop listening. Wow! The songs are soulful and funky. Its an every day soundtrack. True artistry.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Heartbreaking and amazing. The acting is top notch and Cousin Violet is hilarious. Anyone who likes a good drama set in a tumultuous time period  will enjoy this also!
B00571F26Y|4.0|Interesting information. Really makes you think about the food we eat and how it's genetically engineered. I would recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi i love subway surfers sometimes it frezzes but i still love it P.S. if you are or know the creater tell him or her i will do anything for them lol please get this app pleeeaaaasssseeee!!! Lol
B005MLOKXA|5.0|The casting is perfect for each part, plot is engaging. each episode makes me want to watch &#34;just one more&#34;.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|This app is great. Its very easy to set up, the screen on my tablet very accurately displays my pc. The support is very good too which is always good.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|I rarely likes movies as well as the books, but this was an exception. True to the book, perfect casting, memorable characters. Well worth watching
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great series all set in NYC. Fun and not the usual lawyerly stuff! Cannot compare to another show. Great direction.
B002XWXPC8|5.0|Jobu says Major League better than Field of Dreams, and Rookie of the Year combined. You no like Jobu, you no like greatness.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app is way better than just using mobile web version of facebook. The downside is it is still not as refined as iOS or the newest android. Also with all kindle apps, even though it is based on android, you cannot use the latest version of the android app available on google play. Yet in the app, it keep saying you should upgrade...this is very annoying.
B008OW1S3O|5.0|I would describe this album as a chill-core electronic album combined with hiphop. Very good listen, but it won't catch on you at first listen so keep at it!
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|Game is good. Graphics awesome with entertaining gameplay. However the game servers are in dire need of improvement. Sometimes it is just unplayable.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|great movie i like the story around it and that charater plays their parts wonderfully. good pick in my collection CHARLIE HUNNAM !
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Its not the best game in the world,  but its not the worst either.  It is Pretty fun.  Try it for yourself! :&gt;
B001DJLCRC|5.0|great movie i like the story around it and that charater plays their parts wonderfully. good pick in my collection
B000SEFNMS|5.0|I enjoyed the entire heart breaking story!<br />Very well written.  I enjoyed the history of the previuos adventures and their conflicts in life driving them to explore.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The amount of potential this device has could make it as common of a household item as a TV. Imagine going to someone's house and putting content on their TV without having to do anything more than ask for their WiFi password.<br /><br />This device has completely supplanted my PS3 as a Netflix device and Google Play Music has largely supplanted Pandora for the room in which my TV lives. Because most of the stuff that I need to show on my TV is browser-based, Google Cast for Chrome obviates the need for me to find my silly Lightning->HDMI adapter and plug in.<br /><br />Now, if only iTerm2 added DIAL support somehow...<br /><br />*DIAL ([...] is the protocol that drives the Chromecast.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Like for the most part. Freezes up often.  Map is good. Just wish you could get a future button on the map for future storms.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|Great program! Does all the work for you. Easy enough for kids. I would recommend this for anyone with a Kindle.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Excellent except for no Hulu Plus - Google needs to add more apps. Easy installation straight forward setup with phone and samsung tablet
B005LLSZNM|5.0|Enjoyed the plot and story from the first episode to the last.  As usual watching the club members' interactions and how they deal with the &#34;business&#34; of their club was interesting.
B00EY8BRGU|1.0|And I really shouldn't have.<br /><br />If you are an adult you will HATE this movie. I couldn't get through the first 15 minutes.<br /><br />What a waste of money. Not one redeeming quality.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I throughly enjoyed getting to know each of the characters in this show.  Full of grit and humor and the relationship between Tara and Jax is a winner!  Kept me wanting to see more of these people.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast just came in the mail today.  Setup took about 30 minutes.  Most of that time was waiting for my WiFi to recognize my password in the setup.  Use your phone or iPad to run Netflix or Youtube.  Also, you can still use your phone apps, check mail, facebook.  Good picture and much<br />cheaper than buying a Smart TV.  Happy, Happy.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|while the film is a little down, the music is uplifting and it brings me back to the tropics when I listen to it.
B001E75QH0|5.0|It's just pure fun to have all four of these movies in one collection.  I never liked Temple of Doom, but it's part of the collection, so there it is.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|This movie was really on target with the characters the only thing I did not get was about Thor since the girl in the movie Thor didn't come out and they didn't seem to care for her.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I have read all the percy jacksons books but this one is just wow . even though some parsts are slow in the end you kinda know its the best book ever. what im saying is read it even though you might hate the other books. this one crazy book will cange your life
B002WV5A9G|5.0|A superb movie that traces the beginnings of the Star Trek series using one's imagination<br />and excellent photography. If you liked the TV series, you would like this also.
B00EY8BRGU|2.0|The movie started off good but jumps the shark with a plot twist at the end.  ends up feeling very contrived and ultimately leaves one feeling like they wasted a good premise.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Amazing characters and tragic circumstances unfold for a beautiful, engaging story.  I love his other novels as well.  So glad there is another to read.
B00DGMVJAO|3.0|The plot and tone of this film feels like it was directed toward a younger audience but the amount of gore, implied and on screen, makes this unsuitable for that audience.  In the end you have not a horrible film but one that adults will likely find silly and children will find terrifying.
B000NY12CI|4.0|Excellent story! Great insights into the Muslim culture and an awesome story of an incredibly brave young woman. A must read!
B002T66IHC|5.0|Taylor Swift, I remember her first song. Like her style. One of my favorites is Fearless. Order it, you'll like it.
0811879542|5.0|We love this book. It is fun and interactive without being obnoxious like a battery powered book. Fun for my daughter to play with and read. She's had this book since she was 6 months old and I bet she would appreciate it through her 4th birthday. I've given it out a lot as gifts as well.
B0016K40KY|5.0|This is one of those magnificent films that rises and shines and stays shining over the years.  A compelling, gorgeous, starkly tragic wonder.  My favorite part was always Anthony Quinn's Auda Abu Tayi, and that stands.  For the rest, it is simply splendid.  The retored footage makes a real difference.  I'm very glad to have seen this film whole again.
B005HED11Y|5.0|The remastered original Star Trek series looks newer, brighter and more fun.  Enjoy almost all of the changes...colorized backdrops are more interesting and less drab...lighting enhancements feel appropriate and are seamless except to the most discriminating fan.  Replacement of the Enterprise special effects is a small let-down.  The ship looks digital...and doesn't look like a modern rendition of the old ship.  Would have preferred a better-looking, more detailed ship that moved more quickly through space.  The special effects of other spacecraft and planets is excellent, though.  Love to see Industrial Light and Magic remake the entire series one day.  Warp Speed!
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I have had great fun playing this game. The best thing about this game--it is free and many people can have as much fun as I have had with it.
B00BEJ5O6Q|3.0|Nice CD.  I enjoy country music and had nothing by Blake Shelton.  It isn't too bad.  Makes you want to dance in the car.
B005544V6A|5.0|Entertaining and very likable characters that easily pull you into the story of each episode.  Always looked forward to watching the next.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love taking care of my horse! I get to feed her which is so much fun. I also like cleaning her when shes all muddy.
B007GFAX9K|1.0|I was excited to see SUSPIRIA in some form of halfway decent 3D. I checked that it was compatible. It arrived. The package also said all regions. My tv and player are set up for the 3D the site said I would need to view this masterpiece with some 3D depth. ALL UNTRUE! The very machines that the ad said this disc would play on rejected it. Waste of time and money.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|The concert was awesome. The guys sounded great considering their age. Stairway to Heaven was my fav and it was fun watching Jason Bonham perform the drum solo at the end of Rock and Roll. I very much enjoyed the DVD and recommend it for any Zepp fan.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Not what I was expecting from this author.  Didn't match up to his previous novels.  Story would peak, and then fall flat.
B0035JNTA6|4.0|Funny movie! Seen it before still laugh at it even though I've seen it at least a couple times. Funny
B005544V6A|4.0|Quick. Brainy. Clever plot development. Spiffy rapid-fire dialog. Characters you love to hate and characters you care about.A solid 4.
B00EYN3HTA|5.0|I am a big fan of fairy tales, fables and myths so this was right up my alley. It's a dark poetic fairytale with a twist: It matches the first book!<br /><br />A wonderful collection of enchanting poems featuring amazing fairy tale characters that we found in the first book. If you purchase the book, these poems will come to life and jump out at you. You'll recognize the characters.  I was really able to connect the two immediately. This book is beautifully written and so captivating.<br /><br />Definitely buy this book and feel the strong impact that the written poems can make. There were some very interesting  and fascinating poems in this collection.  They take you into the wonderful world of imagination and that I couldn't get enough of.<br /><br />I loved and adored these little treasures!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Most of the time you can't change news feed from most popular to most recent. You can sometimes but not often. Also annoying the Facebook switches the news feed all the time.
B0059WTMLW|4.0|i like the x type where theres a pink x thru the whole thing and the numbers appear twice in the x. i like it has lots of easy ones. I like that you can change the colors on everything.
B00C0YQLDE|5.0|I love bonobo and the way they sound. Smooth and some electric sound to them. Relatively easy on the ears and not annoying jazzy. almost communing with nature sounding
B004X80QNG|2.0|I tried to delete a past appointment and it didn't delete. Then later all my appointments dissapeared. It doesn't change from yesterday to today until late in the morning. The widgets don't update from the app for many hours. I got it because you can have files, categories, and parents for tasks. For now I will keep it for tasks and since I don't want yet another app for appointments I will give it another chance and just not delete anything and we will see what happens.<br />About a month later... stuff dissapears. The widgets update when you rotate the screen (usually). I like the colors for each item and the tabs and how it looks like a paper planner but I can't trust it with important appointments. It is complicated and needs instructions. I got this as FAOTD and don't expect I will ever buy anything from this developer.
B009EAO38C|5.0|They are so easy to listen to. Great background for a party or foreground for the listening room.<br />My wife and I never tire of listening to them.<br /><br />10 Stars from me.
B004XQYBA2|4.0|I like it has lots of easy ones. I like that you can change the colors on everything.I like the variety. Consider I don't really like sudoku. I use it to keep my brain active.
1401942601|5.0|Love these.. Doreen Virtue always brings out her best in all her decks.<br />Easy to read and very detailed. deck of cards.
B00BNGFGIQ|3.0|You can get thru all the gem levels sorta easy but getting the talismans and quick play is really hard unless you &#34;buy&#34; stuff
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Its great I love it how super heroes from the marvel gather and defeat the evil its more then enough to consider this a great movie.
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Highly recommend to all Boz fans. One of his best to date. So good to see him back in top form.
B005OT2YVA|5.0|Storyline, the robots its perfect and its great the 3rds sequel is amazing but its sad how the other prime betrayed the earth
B0067AC5KA|2.0|Just not my type of story. Did not realize  had ordered this as I had already  read the summary and did not like it..
B00819ER0Q|5.0|&#34;The Truman Show&#34; and &#34;The Majestic&#34; are Carrey's finest efforts. Fine acting. Great support from Laura Linney, Ed Harris, and Noah Emmerich.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I could barely put it down the only thing I didn't like is that prim and finnick die. It's so sad but everything else is amazing
B007FG9LIE|1.0|The worse book I have ever read.  In fact, I didn't finish it, but paged though to the end without reading closely.<br />I can not stand the violence and the &#34;other worldliness&#34; of this or any similar book.
B00CBKXGPI|5.0|Wish the free game was longer, you get all caught up in the game then it ends. Must purchase the full version. Can't wait to get the sequel. Play it .and enjoy.
B00A3XQVKW|2.0|Hearing alot about NDE and asked friend their thoughts.  They recommended this book.  I'm still skeptical.  I believe NDEs are possible, but this book didn't do it for me.  Understand this book has a great underlying message about how we should live, it was just too fanciful for me to believe the details.  I couldn't in good conscience recommend this book without caveats.
B0063GORYU|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE THIS GAME. CAN BE FRUSTRATING BUT A GOOD STRESS RELIEVER. SHARPEN THE MIND. LARGE CARDS, QUICK MOVES. GREAT GAME!
B004XUMMFE|5.0|Clever writing, interesting plots and endearing characters make this series one of my favorites that I watch regularly even though I've seen them all before.  They more than stand up to a second (or third!) viewing.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Simple true good action. No exercise fluff or fancy words. This is one of the better comic book to film movies I have seen in a long time.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Old time ST TOS fanatic, but I am enjoying the JJA reboot.  Look for lots of tributes to original cast series and movies, but still moves the mythology forward with new characterizations.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|In the end I enjoyed the way the author brought together the various stories, and their narrators.  However, during the book I found the same literary device a bit distracting and wanted more about each character.
B0058OUJA4|5.0|I downloaded this as a free app of the day, but I would definitely have bought it. The object of the game is to keep &#34;creeps&#34; from going through a portal by placing towers that shoot, stun or slow them down. There is a lot of strategy involved in placement and leveling up the towers. There aren't any ads to contend with and I haven't found any glitches so far. Overall, this game is addictive and fun.
B00DQVSTCG|2.0|Very disappointed in the sound and picture quality. Looks more like a home made cam version vs a blue ray dvd.
B00BXZ3D6Y|5.0|I downloaded this app when I was in a hurry to get a recorder for a meeting that had to be recorded. The app was easy to use and everything worked our well for the meeting. When the facilitator wanted a copy of the recording, I wasn't sure how difficult it would be to get her the copy. As it turned out the file was relatively small (under 10MB for a 90 minute recording) and it was easily played on Windows Media.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Better than any keyboard app you can find on the Android platform. learns how and what you type to improve suggestion. really worth the price
B00EL8JCGU|1.0|I like movies. I like movies better when people try to make them well, e.g., put effort in to the narrative structure, create situations with tension, drama, in the case of this movie, horror, gore, whatever. You don't watch a zombie movie for the sweet parts. I also paid twenty bucks for the privilege of watching this movie, from Amazon. I could tell, after ONE MINUTE, the thing was going to suck. There's old studly, cool, Brad, with his low key, half stoned expression, making breakfast for the kids. With his long hair. In a beautiful middle American house. With a gorgeous kitchen. And a stunning wife. Yup, just flippin' me some pancakes. Oh, and BTW, he's a chief investigator for the UN, where he goes to a lot of \\"bad places.\\" Ooookayy. The chemistry with the kids is almost zero- it's more like, 'hey, you're gettin paid- let's pretend, ok?' The brief flash of \\"genuine\\" emotional exposition I saw was when Pitt, the UN investigator steps out of a car before an imminent zombie attack, to find out what's wrong. There's a cool looking black guy, nicely turned out, also looking confused. \\"Hey,\\" Brad asks him, \\"you need help?\\" \\"Nah, I'm cool,\\" the guy responds. It was the expression on Brad's face that seemed to get at the core of who he was- an actor who seems himself as streetwise, hip,  cool and an operator. A UN investigator with connections to high levels of government? REally? The plot setups were so lame I tried three separate times to watch the movie and failed. Each time.
B000I0QL82|5.0|Nothing much more to say other then Classic.. I loved it everything about this, I bought so that I could pass down a great movie to my kids
B0087FMUCQ|5.0|This game is a lot of fun and very addictive. I spent hours playing it the first time. highly recommend
B002VRZEYM|5.0|The film is very educational and provide an understanding of our ridiculous and industrial food supply.<br /><br />Bad Food<br />Less Farm Land + Better Efficiencies + Tainted and Chemical-Induced Foods + Politics = Expensive Health Care and Wealthy Pharmaceutical Industry<br /><br />Good Food<br />More Land for Farming + Local and Regional Grown Foods + Less Chemicals + Lower Transportation Cost = Moderate Health Care and Morally and Consumer-Oriented Pharmaceutical Industry
B008133MDK|5.0|I'm a longtime Sherlock fan and i think the new Sherlock is great!  Love the updated version with the fabulous actors Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I really enjoy this game a lot and the animals sometimes to hard to catch but I am having fun with it.
B001UTW7QU|2.0|Impossible mess of a plot with cardboard characters attempting to mesmerize the audience with every more bloody and gory shots of CSI does Art Bell.  If you like Alien Viscera in HD, you'll be glued to this one.
B00A83075M|5.0|This is one of our favorite movies of all time and my daughter loves it.  I can not say enough good things about it.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Accurate portrayal of presenile dementia by a very knowledgeable author.  Painful to read at times because it was so well written.
B000002VSN|5.0|This is one of best albums with gospel in there too.i would recommend this album to everyone I know plus everyone they know !!!
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I thought I had written a review for this book. I read it a while ago. I remember I liked it a lot. Sorry I don't remember all the details. Just get the book and read it.
B000NTMWYU|5.0|What and excellent actor - I wouldn't have predicted that Russell Crowe would take, let alone thoroughly ROCK, this type of role. Highly recommended.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Very interesting book.  I love the way James Rollins makes the reader think about our existence.  Be sure to read his comments at the end of the book.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Star Trek into Darkness, was a good movie, me and hubby enjoyed it at home. reminded us of all the other Star Trek shows, I'm a space cadet all the time, and love it.
1433537427|5.0|This ESV Study Bible has the best notes, maps, tables, etc. on the market today. The MacArthur Study Bible is a close second. The wealth of information is astounding and will be a tremendous help to understanding God's word in a deeper way. The ESV translation is literal (very important) and takes into account the most recent biblical scholarship available. The personal size that I got also makes it easier to carry with you; but be aware that the font size is necessarily small. Get this study bible! You won't regret it!
B005MLOOJA|5.0|The only thing that drives me crazy is I can't figure out why Will's girlfriend is always hanging out at the firm's office.
B000000OMB|5.0|Blast from my past!  I loved this album when it was first released in the 80s and I love it still!  All the songs are great, and makes me wish they were still performing.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|After about the first 1/2 of the first episode, I was really hooked. Watched all three Season in about a week.
B005DJREGQ|3.0|For some reason I find this show entertaining and kind of addicting...as an adult.  Since the show is about 15-16 year old sophomores in high school, I can imagine it is marketed to young teenagers (maybe even as young as 12...).  The show is completely inappropriate for teenagers!  There is a lot of foul language (it is bleeped out, but it's obvious what they are saying), sex and underage drinking.  I hope to God this show is nowhere near the reality in our high schools today.  This is definitely an adult-only show.  Watch it after the kids are in bed!
B0060MYM3S|3.0|HBO did not live up to their first seasons quality in filming their second season of Martin's on going story.  I bought the second season more for the background material than the filmed story.  They were worth more to me than what HBO ultimately put on the screen.
B00DCRE83S|5.0|This album is a breath of fresh air.  There is no pretense to this album other than Heavy. It delivers this in a very big way. There are songs from essentially every genre of Metal. Thrash, Progressive, Speed and Power Metal form a very well rounded first effort. While every so often one hears things that are reminiscent of his former band Metallica, it is entirely and completely Newsted. You can tell time was taken in the songwriting process, in that every song is as tight as possible, and the sound of the album is focused consistent and clean. While the bass is very much the forefront of the Newsted sound, it is not overbearing or at the sacrifice of any other parts. This is what makes this album so great. You can hear clearly the driving force of the music. If no other Metal album comes out this year, or if there is a glut of them this will be the album of the year for me. Regular rotation in my household.<br /><br />There is nothing more to say than this album delivers exactly what it says it is. Heavy Metal Music. I would also add the word Integrity. Jason kicks much ass on this album. Looking forward to more!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Excellent game. First got it on my Galaxy and now on the Kindle. Some of the vehicles are utterly ridiculous (I'm talking about you, tourist bus!) But still great fun to play. Definitely recommended!!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun game and worth the download. I just wish you could buy the banana doubles with credits from the game instead of having to use money
B00821OX98|5.0|This is a very good action drama.  It deals with a widely diversified group people in an unbelievably difficult situation.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|I really enjoyed it and I think this was a good movie for 6 years old and above (not sure below that).  I thought it was cute and there were some feel good moments with a positive message at the end.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Although a lot of good common sense, I found that actually reading the book motivational.  Fasting is easy but does take some diligence and planning.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|The DBTech 35mm Flim Slide and Negative Scanner works very well. The only problem is the flim negative feed is a little loose.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Quick, easy read that I couldn't put down--I finished it in a few hours. Tear jerker, well written, beautiful story.
1591842697|5.0|This book is great in all the editions. I like the paperback edition for portability.<br />If you have to present complex ideas to people, this book is key.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I give it a 4 star because the better half likes dry British sitcoms. I've never liked British acting because those people are so stiff and arrogant. Glad we kicked king George out.
B001BKVWYG|4.0|I saw his story on a documentary and was immediately intrigued. After listening to the music, I can see why he might be an icon for that era.
B00000DQSV|5.0|I purchased a copy of this Cd when it came out<br />loved it then , think its the best they ever made<br />Always was a fan of Chic so Nile rogers and Bernard Edwards<br />Bring a real Funky Vibe to it .
B000HX4ZF6|5.0|Good movie, like the movie.. Happy with the movie, will recommend it.. Super nice.. Best movie mel gibson.. A+ grading
B00BWBHIUG|2.0|This WAS a great game until within this last week it won't load. I got to level 20 or 21 but now it gets to 3/4 way connecting to server &amp; it says it has stopped. I don't want to uninstall then 're-install because of my level &amp; I've spent money purchasing extra items. Please fix bug. And yes I have restarted device and that doesn't work
B000H4TX9I|5.0|What an amazing show, the writing is superb!  My only complaint is that there is only one season.  It left me craving more.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I ordered this because it said it supports video play from googles Chrome browser. What they failed to say was that it works only with a chrome browser from a PC, Mac or Laptop. It doesn't support video playback In chrome for IPads,IPhones or Android phones as of yet. So while the simplicity of using Netflix and youtube from your phone to a tv is great, easy and seem less, I cannot give a 5 Starr rating until more apps are supported, especially a browser.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I really like the device. It's small, the screen is easy to read. It seems to track everything pretty well and accurately.<br /><br />The only issue is the belt clip. The device is simply not secure at all in it. Don't trust it in there, put it in your pocket.
0385349947|3.0|This book came so highly recommended by so many of my female colleagues and peers. Perhaps I don't struggle with some of the gender biases that the book so deeply concentrates on in the beginning, but I had a very hard time staying engaged. I have heard from several people that it takes some time to get past the first few chapters but then you just can't put it down. I'm waiting to get to that part of it. I will acknowledge that I really enjoy Sheryl Sandberg's writing style, her personal stories and her drive. I do look forward to finishing the book one day and I do believe it's a worth while book to purchase.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|addicting..ive been playing for 3 mos straight.wish the land was a little cheaper though. I like the scrat game .in the  game
B000B8L6LI|5.0|this is my 3rd set of this exact kit, the stones wear down after a few dozen uses and it's cheaper to buy kit then individual stones<br />i use this on my kitchen knives and select tools and have never been disappointed
B00ESY7QXI|2.0|terrible version of a great book--Redford was wooden in earlier version but Dicaprio simply doesn't have the tragic dimension needed here
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|Every time I try to update this game it will download but will not install. I hope this gets fixed asap.
B00AYB0TOW|1.0|WTH was this movie. Gore beyond gore. I thought Freddy Kuger was the main character in this macarbe. I couldnt watch it all the way through cause it was just a senseless movie for someone who gets a kick out of making this kinda sick movie but not calling it a horror movie which in my opinion, (since you asked me for it) should have been called a horror movie.
B009LDD54K|5.0|This is the best series we've bought, waiting for season 4. Highly recommend it, It just keeps on getting better!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|This book was recommended by my daughter.  It was as good as she said it was.  It gave such a clear idea of what it must be like to be bi-polar.  The author did a great job.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun game, lots of mini-games/activities,great graphics but it a bit too simple. Grooming is uninteresting and the way you train your horse gets old fast. Those flaws aside a really fun game
B006O5YHUY|5.0|Well directed, good acting.. a feel good Rocky theme..Hated the ending..But ..C'mon MAn.. SAm...Sam...he pulled the door off a tank....
0316017930|4.0|A great study on what makes some folks so much better than other folks: timing, effort, and a good 10,000 hours
B0029LCJJS|4.0|The story line may cause you to rethink any preconceived notions you may have about Henry VIII.  He still comes off as ego-centric and narcissistic but these fatal flaws are put into context when the early years of his reign are considered.  Jonathan Rhys Meyers' portrayal of King Henry VIII is perfectly regal:  in his physical presence and his delivery of his lines.  His use of the royal &#34;we&#34; is so arrogant it makes you want to slap him silly.  The intrigues and back stabbing of his sixteenth century English court make Henry's suspicious nature and cunning political moves necessary and justifiable.<br />Sam Neill's turn as the beleaguered Cardinal Wolsey is one of his best acting performances to date.  The cardinal's ill-fated attempts to pacify his king's every whim make this man of God a ready target for many of the enemies of the court.  As season 1 comes to a close he's very much a lame duck cardinal, vulnerable to the shifting loyalties of the court as Henry finds him expendable.<br />The rest of the cast, the beautiful costumes and the authentic scenery combine to make this retelling of the story of one of England's most infamous kings well worth watching.<br /><br />.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I received my ChromeCast a couple of days ago and finally set it up! After a minor (perhaps major to some) hiccup, everything is working as advertized! First, that hiccup was no ability to connect with the Internet. That was probably mostly my fault for not recalling the correct Password for my router. I used the Guest connection and that one requires a browser to open but, of course, there is no browser on ChromeCast. Since, I really wanted a new Router anyway, I purchased another and it immediately connected as planned. I even get more speed in the process!<br />ChromeCast is an excellent way to view video content from the Internet. I used NetFlix, Amazon Prime and was also able to view other content via the Chrome Browser.<br />Just remember, this is for viewing content FROM the Internet, not from your PC or Tablet. Basically, your local device of choice provides the directions to ChromeCast for finding the content. From then on your local device is out of the picture, unless you want to stop or pause the content.<br />I have two TVs and will purchase another ChromeCast, rather than switch between TVs. At an affordable price of $35 that is certainly the best way to handle multiple TVs. But, you can still control the ChromeCast from any of your devices.<br />I used my laptop, smartphone and tablet and all worked just fine.
B005OYKI1I|4.0|Loved the action and yummy guys in this movie.  Not the best in depth plot but a great edition to this series of films. Can't wait to see #6 when it comes out.
B00A2FSXHK|5.0|Tom Cruise sticks to acting in this movie and does a very good job.  The special effects come off pretty well.  The iris scanning for positive identification of the populace is not too far around the corner in our hunt for terrorism suspects.  Well worth watching.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved the story the way the authoer twisted and turned the events and it kept me on the edge of my seat..great story
B00EBDXTJG|1.0|I was hoping to get the Blackened version of the album that just came out, what I recieved was the 1986 Elektra version that has terrible sound.<br /><br />Sending it back
B002ZB26AO|5.0|For such a grim topic the author covers it in an intensely engaging way.  A deep look into the daily lives of North Koreans.
1878424319|1.0|I'm not sure what all the hype is about.  The book makes four points: (1) Be impeccable with your words; (2) Don't take anything personally; (3) Don't make assumptions; and (4) Always do your best.  I would say each of these four points is self-explanatory.  Within each chapter of the book is maybe a sentence or two making a worthwhile point, followed by pages and pages of stream of consciousness rambling.  Much of the rambling, if viewed critically, makes little sense and is in fact quite distracting.  The examples given are not terribly well thought out.  Among the rambling are statements about spirituality and God which assume some level of religiosity in the reader. I purchased this book based on all the positive reviews, but I have to say, I don't understand where they're coming from.  Anyone who has engaged in even a little introspection will not be enlightened by this book.
B00C5R8364|3.0|A slow starter, this novel never builds into the suspense story Mr. Forsyth is otherwise known to have written. It does a good job of weaving in current and recent events from the news, but the story is bland and very predictable.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|Lots of great humor in this movie, to go along with the action. Helen Mirren is gorgeous!<br /><br />I recommend highly!
B00DRGQZRG|5.0|Can I give this SIX stars? THIS MUSICS' GOT MEAT. You wanna groove, swing,tap your foot? Listen to it over and over. I have almost everything Mr. Holland has done and he continues to bring a smile to my face. He once again is surrounding himself with great players who are leaders in their own right. Eric Harland just keeps on impressing. I have seen him play with Mr. Holland and always enjoy watching & listening to his playing. Kevin Eubanks is just a monster guitarist who many don't realize how good he is. This is my first taste of Craig Taborn and he appears to be everything (and more)that I keep reading about him. Love his Fender Rhodes playing. The music just soars. If you haven't ever heard Mr.Holland play like this may I suggest listening to Gateway I & Gateway II (the tune Nexus), any electric Miles he was involved with and his earlier quartet with Kevin Eubanks, Marvin Smitty Smith & Steve Coleman (Extensions).I can't wait to see these guys when they get to New York. I hope there is more coming.
B00DQVST76|5.0|. . .but she puts on a great show!  Some may not like the theatrical elements included in the DVD (eg, black and white, still shots) but taken as a whole it captures the elements of the live show which I had the good fortune to see more than once.  If you ever have the opportunity to see Madonna perform live, do it--you won't be disappointed.
B008R9QAY6|5.0|This is more than a specialist's release.  The singing is spectacular in every way--beautiful tone, virtuosity, musicianship.  The star, Phillipe Jaroussky is a known quantity, but the other singers are at least his equal and indeed one of them, Franco Fagioli. steals the show.  The conducting has enormous rhythmic incisiveness, and the music itself brims with music and drama.  I delayed listening to this for fear I would be bored.  I was galvanized!
B007ZH9P0C|4.0|If you're a hardcore Madonna fan or like remixes then this is the CD for you.  I like almost all of the songs on the MDNA album, but this is one of my favorites.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This is the one thing, the endless prompting for a game rating that makes this game slightly annoying. The game Dungeon Hunter 4 is an excellent application for the space allotted for game construction.
B00E3D7WGU|5.0|There's only one queen, and that's Madonna. . .the concept of &#34;CD on demand&#34; is interesting; I'm one of those who likes to have a physical copy of the music I purchase. Having said that, I was disappointed to see that digital download was not included with purchase.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Far too many pages of useless monologue by the main character during meetings.  The action was so slow that it often got very tedious.

0930289234|4.0|When I was a kid reading Superman and Batman comics, things were pretty straightforward. There was the good guys with their superpowers and then the villains who had few if any redeeming qualities. It was easy to root for the heroes and be amazed by how their superpowers obliterated pretty much anything that stood in the way of justice. Watchmen take a much more \\"realistic\\" approach, and we are presented with a set of heroes that have flaws like everyone else, and whose motivations may not always be the common good. The setting for the novel is mostly 1985, a time when these heroes have been outlawed and are in retirement, there is a tense situation in terms of the struggle for world domination by the usual suspects, and the United States have an ace in their sleeve, Dr. Manhattan, which is pretty much the only one of these superheroes that has superhuman powers.<br /><br />When someone kills a former watchman known as The Comedian, a chain of events leads to one of the most interesting stories ever presented in a graphic novel. There are many characters to keep track of, and it takes a while for the different pieces of the plot to start connecting with each other, so it does take a bit of effort by the reader to keep at it. If you do though, you will be rewarded at the end.<br /><br />There are many things I liked about this book. First, you have the fascinating story as already mentioned, but this is also complemented perfectly with proficient art, some of which is truly breathtaking. There are many little gems hidden inside the story, this is done by references to the world these people live in and the reader can't help but compare it to what actually was going on in the US in 1985. I am sure I probably missed many of these gems, but there were enough I did catch to make me feel happy. The authors use a comic within the comic, which at first seems a little confusing, but once you get the hang of it, it becomes another positive element in the experience. In between each of the twelve volumes we get a few pages of information on different topics. Some come from newspapers, some from personal correspondence, others from psychiatric notes. The common thread is that all of them provide the reader with context as to what we are actually reading in the graphic novel, and are therefore a crucial piece of the puzzle. I enjoyed reading most of these, but there were a couple that were a little dull.<br /><br />Even though I can't say this is the perfect graphic novel, I do have to say that it has many characteristics that make it come close. Especially in what has to do with its originality and even the message it delivers. Every fan of the medium has to read this.n each of the twelve volumes we get a few pages of information on different topics.

B005544TRQ|5.0|We really enjoyed revisiting the first series and remembering some of the back information on the characters, good enough to purchase, yes.
B005LAII44|5.0|I like fast action movies so this movie was my kind of show.  Great action and the actors were wonderful.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Second season non stop anticipation and intrigue.  Great  characters  and acting.  Twisty plot.  Can't wait till the next season.  Awesome series.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Story dovetails nicely to hunger games story with some review In case time lapse between readings. Anxious to read the final story to see what happens next.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|If you have read other Luckily books you will recognize her style. It takes till the end to know all the details and may not be what you thought. Always intriguing.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|I love this game and highly anticipated the new &quot;Endor&quot; levels!  Wish I could play, but every time I open the world, the whole game shuts down. Have tried 're-installing it but no good!!!!!!!!
B00CWVG1Z8|5.0|I enjoyed it. The southern accents.. I enjoyed it. If you like witch craft, fiction movies, and love stories, you will enjoy it.
0694003611|5.0|My baby (24 years old) loved this book when she was a wee one!  I bought it for my niece who was expecting her first born! Adorable!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|We have fallen in love with this series and can't wait for season 4 to begin to see how it twists and turns again. Great season as were all the others.
0446547638|5.0|I choose 5 stars because anything that Nicholas Sparks writes is the best. They are so good. Can't wait to read his next one. :)
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|Well written, but I'm tired of teens fighting demons.  This book was meant for teens and I was<br />just curious, no this is not Harry Potter which is a much better experience.  This not the Hunger<br />Games which has very good character interaction and a unique world.  So if you have not read the<br />above books, read them first.  It's not a bad read, just others are better.
1616615362|5.0|The Slave I Expansion Pack is an expansion for the X-Wing Miniature Game, which happens to include great model of Boba Fett's Slave I. The sculpt of this miniature is amazing, and the paint job is just spot on to the Slave I in the Empire Strikes Back.  Those fans of the infamous bounty hunter are going to have a treat with this one.<br /><br />This miniature is about 3.25\\" tall, and can only be mounted in flight mode.  Also it is at scale with other miniatures in the X-Wing Miniature Game such as the X-Wing and Tie Fighters.  At least, I'm taking the Fantasy Flight Games modelers word on this.<br /><br />In addition to the Slave I, this expansion includes a stand and a base for the miniature, two ship tokens for the base, one maneuver dial and a rulesheet.  Of course there are plenty of other tokens as those included for the X-Wing Miniature Game.<br /><br />However, the cards included in the expansion take the spotlight after the miniature. This expansion includes:<br /><br />4 ships/pilots: Boba Fett, Kath Scarlet, Krassis Trelix and one Bounty Hunter;<br />4 copilot/gunner cards: 1 Gunner and a Mercenary Copilot<br />2 elite talent cards: 1 Expose and 1 Veteran Instincts;<br />2 cannon cards: 1 Ion Cannon and 1 Heavy Laser Cannon;<br />2 missile cards: 1 Homing Missiles and 1 Assault Missiles;<br />1 Proximity Mines and 1 Seismic Charges cards;<br />2 modification cards: 2 Stealth Devices;<br />1 title card: Slave I and<br />2 reference cards.<br /><br />The Slave I is a match to the X-Wing in attack and agility. In addition, it can perform a Koiogran turn at speed 3 and has double the hull and shields, plus an additional back firing arc.<br /><br />Overall, this is very good model for Star Wars fans, and hard to pass expansion for X-Wing players.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|loved this series. Can't wait for the second season to begin. Not quite as evil as Kelsey Grammer in Boss, but close.
B00B7ERH04|1.0|Or does it in some odd way that is in no way apparent. Tried to look it up, went through all menus - should be more user friendly. Or there's a glitch, which is what I suspect!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I couldn't install the unit with my Acer C7 Chromebook - seems that the Chrome OS couldn't \\"talk\\" to the Chromecast and my WiFi at the same time - but once I installed the unit with my Dell Laptop, it works just fine with my Chromebook.  The literature would lead you to believe that the Chromecast only works with a couple apps (NetFlix, etc., etc.) but that's only for HD.  Actually, if it shows on your Laptop/Chromebook screen, you can \\"cast\\" it to your TV.  This one little unit replaces an entire complex of wires/boxes/etc. to convert VGA to HDMI so I can watch the Phillies via MLBTV to the big screen (and MUCH cheaper than Boxee, etc.)
B008J05EL8|1.0|I purchased this this by accident - nothing has changed. It seems to download but that is it. It still does not open all it is doing is taking up space. It will be deleted and I hope to get my money back.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I ordered the Chromecast figuring no matter what, it's just $35 and it can be used on a spare tv to watch Netflix and the occasional Youtube video.... No harm, no foul. Wow. I love this little thing. I have a dedicated Mac Mini with Plex installed to stream video around the house to various tv's, ipads, roku's,and other devices and i love that, but the Chromecast does it's very limited job so well that it is, overall, a joy to use.<br /><br />I use it for youtube videos more than anything else. i send a video and keep searching for other things to watch and then add them to the queue. Maybe I'll throw up a couple of internet shows i subsrcibe to and a few user reviews as well, maybe a new music video from vevo... in no time i have a custom show for me to watch while i do other things... nice. it's simple and i find that the video streams better with less buffering issues than with anything else i've used. I've had this little dohickey for about a week and have been using it non-stop (something i didn't expect). you control the Chromecast with which ever device you sent the video (ios device, android, pc). it would be nice if i could seamlessly switch devices and still control the queue. currently the device that dealt it smelt it...... or something like that.<br /><br />at the end of the day this little thing costs $35 has the potential of being greater that it currently is. If true, Vimeo, HBOGo, Hulu are actively working on making their services work with the Chromecast, this thing could be a game changer. you can buy three of these for a little more than an Apple TV of Roku. Very impressed. Very cheap way to make a dumb tv a little smarter.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Kept you in suspense. Mrs. Hunter vivid detail of events was fantastic. It made it seem as you right there by her side watching on.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Yea it's a little like temple run ok it's a lot like temple run but much better with bosses more areas epic power ups and it's free it's just a great app to get (ps the slide part is kinda hard)
078322608X|5.0|No, this is not a film review. If you are a Gilliam fan, this is a must own. A keeper
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The situation the book was based on was very sad, but the book was written very well.  Couldn't put it down.  Now on to the next one.
B005NKGEP2|5.0|I needed to pay attention to this one. The author flips back and forth in time. A good plot and mostly believable. Reading it felt like unrolling a ball of yarn for a suprise in the middle.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This pulled me in, kept me reading in spite of a dangerous, possibly depressing story. I cannot wait to buy another book by John Green.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Wish there were more levels or scenes. Would love to &quot;run&quot; through more than just the lab, neighborhood, and the lare. Otherwise love it, cute and entertaining!!
1781162646|5.0|I got it for a gift for my granddaughter, she loves anything<br />Steven King writes. Will share with me when she finishes!
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|The calendar does nothing. I want one to keep appointments and can't seem to find one that works with Kindle<br />Evernote, can not get it to work either<br />as for right now I hate the Kindle.
B009CG29RK|5.0|My five year old loves this movie so i had to purchase so we can watch it again and again and again...
B00957T6X6|5.0|The breadth and depth of Westeros are staggering. The only drawback is I have to wait for Ser Martin to finish writing the next book! VALAR MORGHULIS
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app is mindless fun for my five year old. keeps him entertained when he needs to be occupied when he is bored..
0030862108|5.0|This is a very sad commentary on how the US Government and greedy business interests treated the American Indians.  I always knew it was bad but I didn't know it was that bad.  The book is very sympathetic towards Native Americans but it also gives credit to the few whites who tried to treat the Indians fairly.  I highly recommend this book.  I gave my copy away so someone else could read it.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|I enjoyed this and so did my five year old son... The violence is fantasy violence so no worries on that.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|the numbers are big and it works well.  I don't know why I have to have a minimum word count for the review though.-
0786962984|5.0|Played this game when I was a kid and now I get to play it again with my son. Minimal changes in 30 plus years. In fact two days after I received this and played a few games with my son i found my old copy of this from the 70's... Just a couple of minor updates but other then that it's the same...
B000002INJ|5.0|I gotta say, I figured this band was simply overly gimmicked up \\"Meatal\\" Metal.  You know,,,guys who think they KICK ASS with guitars etc. though nobody actually kicks anyones ass....Police record would indicate this,,,hahah. No Band Kicks ass in any literal sence.  With that said, MANOWAR looks and sounds fun. They are Pro entertainers that stick to a theme and don't run off into any \\"artistic chemistry\\" that fans will never understand. They really make no profound statements (which I like) and maybe are the BEST at what they do. They cater to their fan base very well. Merchandise awesome. Plus the idea of re-issueing their old catalog on their own label is SMART business as they now control any use of the re-recorded material not allowing former label to cash in. They own the publishing.  I've never seen them live, but would do so at first chance and would travel to do so.  All in all, if you are a fan of fun and don't take this all seriously. Great SPINAL TAP moments which makes me think that they have their \\"tounge firmly in cheek and have great longevity. POWER TO THEM!! Give any of the releases a try, turn it up and have fun. I would consider myself a FAN!!! I wish more acts would be this good.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|There are many concepts in this book that will help me with selling and non-sales selling. The author provides many case studies showing that serving others is a part of our basic human nature.
B004LP3AYI|3.0|Ok, I'm seldom moved to log onto Amazon and write a review of a book, but in this case, I had to.  Like any writer who has a love story developing between two main characters, Terry Goodkind fell into the Twilight trap.  Never mind that this was probably written before Twilight.  Or perhaps Stephanie Meyer got her inspiration for Bella and Edward from Stone of Tears.  I'm about 25% through the novel, and I can sum up the dialog thusly: \\"Oh Richard, I love you and never wanted to be parted from you.\\" \\"I love you, and we'll be together always.\\" \\"I'm not leaving you!\\" \\"You must, it's dangerous!\\" \\"I'll die for you!\\" with an occasional \\"I hate magic! [even though I'm the most powerful Wizard/Seeker/Mother Confessor ever]\\" thrown in.  All of this moping and whining about their eternal love for each other and their willingness to die for each other, and the complaining about their considerable magical gifts, is compensating for a rather thin plot, which is only moved forward by further hand wringing and exclamations of love and sacrifice.  I'm not sure I can make it to the end of this one.  I'm not so sure it deserves three stars but I'm in a good mood today.
1781162646|5.0|This is a great little paperback that I would happily read again. Normally I prefer hardbacks but the summer theme and paperback only availability of this book worked together well. It's a gripping and exciting quick read from Uncle Stevie and I would love to see more like this in the future. It took me back to summertime adventures in my youth and the fun and excitement of a small theme park. Being a paperback I didn't fell as much guilt when I finished it lent it to a friend. That's what paperbacks are for right?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I think this game is the beast game ever<br />Eh xXx udnxjdnxidnxjdjdjsj sided the really only similar thing you two do is a pretty open source software to do that time I could have to wait until you get a lot more to the pedestals and robbers aerospace
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|action packed with reminiscence of old school Sylvester Sloan Judge movie.you want the movie to continue while you're asking for more.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Love the clothes, cars and characters!!  I rarely watch tv.  I only watched 2 shows in the past 10 years and this was one of them.  The other one was Gossip Girl for the clothes and drama.  This one actually in a strange way is very similar to Gossip Girl because of clothes and drama... just a different time period is all but still focusing on expensive spending habits.
B00AEBBAF4|4.0|It's a funny movie, even silly if you like, but I had a really good time watching it....The cast is excellent and the parts with Tom Cruise as a studio head are hilarious!
1781162646|5.0|It took me about a day and a half to get through Joyland, I couldn't put it down.  I was irked at first that it wasn't available on Kindle, but the feel of a book in my hand was welcome nostalgia.  The story was crisp, the characters were believable and likable, and the plot had just enough twists in it to keep me wondering until just near the end.  It may not be quite up to &#34;The Green Mile&#34; or &#34;The Shawshank Redemption&#34; but it's close.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I enjoyed watching this.  It is a series I never saw so catching up was fun.  I like your Prime membership
B00C7JGDBW|1.0|I like Franco. I love happy ending movies. But I did not like this movie because:<br /><br />1-Horrible CGI -They just got so lazy in this movie it was amazing this made it out to the theaters.<br /><br />2-There was nothing likeable about the main character Oz. Not even when he \\"redeemed\\" himself.<br /><br />3-They made the main character a womanizer.<br /><br />4-The acting was pretty bad.They acted  and dressed like it was 2013 in contemporary U.S. Not another world, another time. This was a prequel right?<br /><br />5-The monkey bell hop was creepy through the whole movie. I kept waiting for him to turn on Oz and he never did so I was disappointed.<br /><br />BUT I have to say in one area they excelled and I loved was the little porcelain doll. Her character was spunky and cute and she was animated/rendered beautifully.That is what the one star is for the doll alone, otherwise this movie would have double goose eggs from me.
1616551607|5.0|book full of sketches...no nonsense stuff. what i love about this book is some sketches are so crude yet the evolution is amazing afterwards...this truly inspires that u just need a start and u can go about doing wonders.
B0028KF4M4|5.0|I've been hooked on Dexter since it started. It's a little hard to take if you get squeemish. Not a problem for me!
141694737X|5.0|My baby boy loves this book.  He tried to open the flaps as I read the book out to him
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I won't list any spoilers, but this one definitely made me squirm a little. Still good, but enter at your own risk.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved the chapter organization, with events narrated by different characters.  Great descriptions by Ms. Diffenbaugh.  I highly recommend this book.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|As with most BBC series it was very well done.  The sets were beautiful, acting outstanding.  We were sorry to see come to an end.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is just a great, all around calculator, for everyday use. My kids use it to do homework, and my wife and I use it to pay bills and keep our budget up to date. I recommend it to anyone needing a hand calculator.
B00BP4ZNFM|4.0|All time classic.  This movie pushed the ratings boundaries due to language. I had forgotten about the language the kids used.
B000FC130E|5.0|I've just started getting into fantasy fiction , but am picky. Don't like out of space stuff or outlandish. This book weaves together the real and the alter reality.<br />It takes place in London during modern times. It also exams the eternal question- Why am I here?
B003YL4LYI|5.0|The amazing series continues in this book. My son could not put it down and is ruining the show for all of us
B002VPE1WK|4.0|The backpack is very cusomizable as the inside padding can be readjusted to better fit your camera. It very light and has enough pockets and compartments to fit more lenses and accessories than I think youll need.<br /><br />Has great straps including chest and &#34;hip&#34; straps and is very comfortable and compact. Buy this backpack, dont worry that its not brand name.
B004OO4UFY|5.0|I've been a fan of The Heavy, for a long time. This a great album, as is the Glorious Dead.
B00AYB0TOW|2.0|This is coming from the perspective of someone who has never read the comics. This is coming from someone who would have given the Stallone movie 3 stars.<br /><br />This movie sucked! There was no depth to the story or characters. Some background was briefly explained but you never really got to know them, the judges or the villains. It was like the producers asked themselves \\"Okay, how can we get as much gore into a movie as possible? I know, I know, let's show bullets blowing people's heads off in slow-motion!!!<br /><br />I don't mind some gore, but seriously...<br /><br />There you have it, my review.
B004WCTLNY|5.0|Fast paced.  I enjoyed the development of characters.  Ending was awesome.  I plan to watch it again and again.  I recommned it highly.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|AMAZING can't wait to read the next book but man do I hate cliff hangers over all 5 out of 5
B005K17RU0|4.0|a good guide for my actions each day. lets me know a lot about my clothing needs for the days activity's. thanks for a good app.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love to do puzzles that really make you think.  This was fun, but need to download more levels to do more.
B007Q53IQ0|5.0|You go Girl! However, the film attacks a problem, that remains taboo.  Nonetheless, well done, in plot humor, and acting.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a real challenging game.  It is fun to try to make it through all of the obstacles.  Great animation.
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|This book had absolutely nothing in it. Wasted my money buying it. She did not progress the story at all. Disappointed!
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game makes me laugh.  I am terrible at it, but it is still fun to try to &#34;make it&#34; up and down the hills!!!
B005UG542S|5.0|Waited for years to see the movie. Finally did and enjoyed it with the family. ease of ordering was fine too
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I loved playing this game and getting all of the upgrades to receive more coin extras.  I will say that once the coins are never ending, it gets a bit more boring, but still fun to play.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Great movie but very long--singing singing andmore singing . Some of the songs you chant after you see it . Would watch it again if snowing outside and couldnt leave the house
B00E193TM2|5.0|Ever since I bought this CD last week, I can't stop listening to it. I think I've repeated it at least 30 times, MUST HAVE!
B004UPANAI|5.0|all I can say is WOW...loved the movie-it was the best ever and I would so watch it again but why is sabertooth his brother
B008M87GJK|4.0|BBC gives a balanced view of world news that helps to understand global issues.  I really enjoy their style and their perspective.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|Liked the ease of ordering; watched as a family movie ., It was from the aspect of prior to dorothy hitting the scene and we loved it
B000NTPDSW|4.0|I have the old DVDs but wanted to move up to Blue Ray. The movies are one of my all time favorites but I am disappointed in the sound quality. Not consistent, it goes from where I have to turn the volume up to comfortable then it blasts sound~~~up, down, up, down.
B004WMKSH2|5.0|watched and finally enjoyed a movie we had not seen but thought we wouldnt like but we loved it, of course
B008XG1X18|5.0|Addicting version for your mobile device. I don't like how they put your most recent boards at the top of your list of board choices though, my problem is that when I go to pin something to a recent board, it readjusts to different boards and I end up pinning random stuff to random boards.
B009C7JS14|3.0|The app in itself is ok. Nice background and good info. The issue is that every time you turn it on, you have to regect the request to upgrade. I don't need more than I have at the moment. How about checking every 10 times I use it?
B007SOQBCM|1.0|this app is useless. you cant manage you setting or even view your profile. this app does nothing for me. I hats it
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Super read!  Page turner from beginning to end.  Some of the language was unnecessary to make it a good read.  Enjoyed it very much.  Enjoyed it
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|My five year old and I love playing this game. So much you can build grow and do. Fun for all ages.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I ordered this movie and really enjoyed it.  It has action and humor and was a great watch.  Recommend it to all.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|A story following the rise to fame of a group of banded illusionists, the kicker is not necessarily how they do the magic that they do, but who is pulling the strings. Even audiences who do not believe in magic will find themselves wrapped up in the mystery of this fantastic movie.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|This movies has zombies, of course, but they're a bit different here, they're more of a colony of ants. I will let readers think about that one, since I am not a spoiler. I like the fact that it wasn't just about the zombies but an investigation into their origin. Brad Pitt's performance was great in this movie.<br /><br />The only thing about the movie I didn't like, after it's finished it suddenly just felt like a prequel to a sequel.
B0089XH38M|4.0|The program found a potential threat on my Kindle on its first scan and eliminated it.  I am happy about that.
B009CCBCU4|5.0|Very interesting view of two cultures . The intertwining of lives of two boys becoming men. Trials and triumphs of intolerence and fear and the difference trust can make throujgh sharing adventures together. Look forward to next novel in series.
B008HK3TXK|2.0|Loved the gripster when I first recd it.  Although I've had it for 8 months; I only use it occasionally when I travel.  The velcro tab on the inside of the front cover tore completely out.  I feel for the price of the gripster that it certainly should take a lot more use than I've give it.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|It's a good read. i am Only half way through but so far so good! I would always recommend James Rollins.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love love this game.I can play it all day if I could.I like that its 101 games in one big game.
B00847VY92|5.0|Interesting that grown up comes at 20 years old. : )  But the simplicity of kindness and humility and thoughtfulness continues in this sequel.  Its definitely worth the read.  it makes you wish to live in this era.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I absolutley adore this app. My family does not attend Church and this app is like &quot;going to Church&quot; everytime i open it up! :) There is so much to do with this app and many things to learn! I want to try as many reading plans as possible! :)
B00ECU2RGY|5.0|Great movie with a good twist at the end.  TC's acting is as good as ever and the supporting cast works well.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this app will (figure) calculate it for you. need to know the cost of those shoes with that 35% off plus tax; this is the app for you.
B00AALX5SI|2.0|Would have liked to see more of Katy Perry and her side of the stroy and leave out the fans. We know whe has fans but we found them boring so we just fast-forwarded their side.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I've read this book twice. Nice story can't wait until the movie comes out. Totally recommend it!<br />LOVE IT! TY
1781162646|5.0|Great book definitely a solid entry to the long list of Stephen King books. Give it a read you won't be dissapointed.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This item does not have any advantages over using my wi-fi blue ray player.  There are no apps that this uses that I cannot get for my blu-ray player.
B005EVVESM|5.0|I purchased the first &#34;Hands All Over&#34; when it first came out as I was led to believe that &#34;Moves Like Jagger&#34; was on it and that's the song I wanted.  Well, &#34;Moves Like Jagger&#34; wasn't on the first edition of this CD.  Ticked a lot of people off, all felt misled.  Well, this 2nd one actually has the song on it.  So while I'm not delighted to buy 2 of the same CD just to get the one song I really wanted, I do really like the entire CD.  But I am more careful now about ensuring a CD actually has the particular music on it that you're led to believe it has.  Yet another lesson learned about on-line purchasing.
B00ADS98FC|3.0|really don't see why everyone I know is talking about it, it was kind of funny. But pretty stupid, I wont recommend it
B0090X4GJE|5.0|Heard one of her songs on some tv show or another, and just loved it, so ordered off amazon.com.  Received the CD, and you know how it's always a gamble with CDs whether you're going to like any of the other songs on the entire CD?  Even if you listen to the so-many-seconds samples?  Well, I really enjoy every single song on this CD - every one is a winner.  Just love her voice.  Was surprised because this is the first CD I've ever bought in all my many years of living and buying CDs where I truly liked/loved every single song on it.  If you enjoy her voice and one of her songs, my guess is you'll really like the rest as well.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Vevo is my inspiration to workout.  Everyday I can go to the gym, watch videos, and work it out! It has literally changed my life.
B000002I8D|4.0|I'm a Phil Collins fan so really enjoy pretty much anything Phil Collins...and this is no exception...some of my favorites on here, but enjoy them all.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Very good movie :), sound and video quality kind of average, i wish i could had see it on HQ in the pc
B008P1EWIM|5.0|This is a good app. I have it on my phone and love it. I love the graphics, it is so life like. Get this app!!
B00EL8I8IS|1.0|It was very frustrating since we can't watch even the 10 first minute since the movie never download, it take for ever to the download and we have 50MB download stream in my contact with comcast.<br />I would like to get my money back since we was unable to see the movie.
B00EB6F1TY|1.0|Not as good as the first 2. bad story not enough action. keep your money in your pocket.<br />don't bother
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I am a non-stop reader, never without a book. But every so often a story touches me so deeply I have to hold on to it for a while. Such is the case with And The Mountains Echoed. Such has been the case with The Kite Runner and A Thousand Splendid Suns. But more so with this latest story than the others. Through Hosseini's magnificent writing, the story that unfolds and the characters that populate it, create a world so rich with beauty, love, and humanity that you can't resist wanting to be a part of it. I will not recommend this book to my friends and family - I will insist they read it, even if I have to read it to them. This is a story every family should read and reflect upon.

0470901071|5.0|Conversational style of writing makes it easy to read.<br />The additional materials for studying really help too.<br /><br />Typically networking books put me to sleep, and I must read with a steady diet of caffeine loaded drinks on hand.<br /><br />That being said, this is very well written.<br /><br />I will pass this on to my friends who are studying for the CCNA, as I am preparing to take the test within the next 2 weeks.
B004VQRCF0|4.0|sound quality wasn't top notch but acceptable.. band's set list could have been better too..but a must for all YES fans
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Lots of cool guns and graphic violence in this remake. Parts of it reminded me of the video game &#34;Boarderlands&#34; as some of the guns are just ridiculous.<br /><br />Probably better than the one Stallone did, but like all shoot-em-up movies there is little room for real acting.<br />(It seems that all the explosions, and graphic violence/special effects are an attempt to make up for the lack of talent coming out of Hollywood these days.)<br /><br />Anyways, I liked it.<br />Please note, it is NOT family friendly.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|This is really a great game you really have to use your brain to solve it you will have fun doing it
B009KWU6Q2|5.0|I love all of the different Peter Pan stories but this is a favorite with the family! Robin Williams is great!
B00846REIS|3.0|Ehhhh I liked it don't get me wrong, I just needed something more. Maybe  it's just me. The encounters were not as I hoped they would be. But overall good
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|Each time i shutdown and go back to the game it says not login and i login again,and did not work.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|so glad that Amazon offers the Classics for free. I finally am reading the ones I missed. someone should remake this story into a movie again.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I found that the story line is not as depressing and/or jarring as Hosseini's prior books.  The plot does provide perspective as to the plight of Afghanistan and Afghanies in America.  The characters' story lines are nicely woven.  Overall, a good book.
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|I vacillated between 3 and 4 stars for this book set in 1970s Ireland. The characters were endearing (except for those in the 1930s flashback) and well developed. My favorite scene was when Jamie and Lydia meet in the hotel, and I enjoyed the gentle humor found throughout the novel. But the book seemed overwritten in parts and didn't flow naturally. I may try reading another of the author's books as I did like the story and did become involved with the characters.
B00BESJYAY|5.0|So real. So true. This movie will touch your heart.. A beautiful insightful story. I would watch it again. And again
B009LDD1X0|5.0|Even though episodes of The Big Bang Theory seem to be airing nearly every day on my local TV stations (sometimes two at a time) in addition to new episodes on CBS, I find that this is a series made for \\"binge watching\\" via the DVD sets.  One reason is that each episode takes 30 minutes to watch on TV but, once the commercials are removed, each filmed episode lasts just 20 minutes. So you can enjoy the series in 1/3 less time. The other reason is that these shows are like potato chips: you can't eat (well watch in the case of TBBT) just one. And in less than three evenings you can devour this 24 episode set.  Personally, I think that watching certain ones together make the story lines flow better.<br /><br />If you are one of the few who found this review but have not seen the show before, know that, while it always pays to go back to the beginning, you can start most anywhere though you won't understand Howard's time as an astronaut or how Sheldon got a \\"girlfriend\\".<br /><br />The show definitely has a cult audience among \\"celebrities\\" and in Season 6 we get appearances by astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Mike Massimino as well as lots of mentions of Stephen Hawking and - the funniest episode for me - Bob Newart as a former kids' science  TV show host.  As with other volumes, there are a bunch of interesting Special features.  There is a panel with the cast at the 2013 Paley Fest in LA, two fun pieces dealing with the astronauts, the now-requisite \\"deleted scenes\\" and \\"gag reel\\" and a 30 minute featurette with each of the cast's \\"couples\\" on how their relationships are handled (I won't give you details because there are some \\"spoilers there.)<br /><br />I came to the series later than many and used the DVD sets to \\"get up to speed\\". And with this 6th season I'm there; ready to see where plot lines take us.<br /><br />This is one of the smartest TV series in years and has a wide appeal to everyone.<br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"/>Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
B00DGN51O8|5.0|This is our new family favorite movie. Could watch this over and over! I already watched it several times so that other people could see what I loved so much.
B002DEI4NG|5.0|I'm enjoying watching this over the summer - never saw it when it was on TV.  It's engaging, funny, and I can related to many of the characters.
159463176X|4.0|Warning: spoilers ahead.<br /><br />I have major mixed feelings about this book. There are aspects of the book that deserve nothing less than 5 stars, but sadly IMO, these are dragged down by other aspects of the book that don't fare as well.<br /><br />Hosseini tells the story of Pari and Abdullah through a woven rope of separate stories. A potential pitfall of this approach is that the reader could lost interest. After all, it's easy to get mired by ever-increasing characters, and moreover, each chapter feels like beginning the novel anew with fresh characters that the reader has to learn about. I have to say Hosseini ducked these pitfalls masterfully. I had no problem getting into each story. The writing was lush, the prose rich with imagery, and the characters breathed oxygen. Moreover, each chapter was loaded with enough conflict to keep me glued.<br /><br />Where the novel doesn't do as well for me is the main arc, the rope that gets woven by each story. Because each story is so far removed from Pari and Abdullah, I don't feel vested in these characters, especially Abdullah since hardly any background details are given about him. Towards the end, I just don't really care about whether they will eventually communicate. Abdullah's stroke feels like a hit-and-miss attempt to add conflict at the last minute. Add to this that some of the stories didn't really feel like they had anything to do with this main arc. Like the one about the child with the wound on her head. How is that related to Pari and Abdullah again?<br /><br />I feel like this book tried to do too much and lost sight of its unspoken promise to the reader. It started out promising a tale of an estranged brother and sister, but along the way, ventured too far astray - much like Pari and Abdullah themselves.<br /><br />I'll still give it 4 stars though - for the quality of the prose.
B001EA4M7M|4.0|I find it sad that many Jane Austen fans are generally unaware of this miniseries. It truly is the closest to the book of any of the adaptations out there. David Rintoul and Elizabeth Garvey play Darcy and Elizabeth in the way I believe Jane wrote them and much of the dialogue (and Darcy's entire letter, read as a voiceover) are straight from the novel. Production values are admittedly of lower quality then recent movie and miniseries adaptations due to budgetary constraints, I'm sure, but this 5-part edition of Pride and Prejudice is still the best according to this lifelong Jane Austen fan.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|The most fun bubble game out there. I am so addicted. I have downloaded about every bubble game out there and this has to be the best one out there.
B00004W50T|5.0|The original of this album is one of the truly greatest folk-rock records ever recorded. The extra tracks added to this version don't really contribute much, but hearing &#34;The Weight&#34; and &#34;Chest Fever&#34; again after all these years is a rare treat and not to be missed.
B00A27X972|3.0|Interesting concept, but a little contrived.  I did enjoy the book, just not as much as I thought I would.
0061537969|4.0|I was given this book as a gift and intrigued when I heard the premise of a dog telling the story. However this was really not what I expected, although that's not totally a bad thing.<br /><br />This was a well-written book that told the story of a family, namely the man Denny by his dog Enzo. Denny is a race car driver and his dog Enzo enjoys racing as much as he does. The heartwarming and sometimes heart-wrenching story of Denny and his family  is told very well through Enzo's eyes. Enzo is a very articulate and philosophical dog that often seems more human than canine. Through his life with Denny, his wife Eve and their daughter Zoe, Enzo does everything he can to not just be a good dog--but be a good enough dog to be born again as a man in his next life. It's through his short life that we learn not so much what it means to be a good dog, but a good person.<br /><br />Now, while the things I didn't like/found weird about this book were so small I only took away one star, there were quite a few. As a dog lover, I was excited to read a book written from a dog's POV, but Enzo is not just human-like he is so un-dog like it sometimes annoyed me. He cares about things that (knowing common canine behavior) dogs do not care about, and he also thoroughly resented and was ashamed of being a dog. In fact I was wondering if at the end we would find out that Enzo wasn't a dog at all, but actually a mute person and he used being/living as a dog as a symbol for describing how he felt. That being said, this is still a very good read. I would be sure to recommend it to people who enjoy philosophical thought, reincarnation, and cars. Oh, and dog lovers might like it too--even though the dog isn't very dog-like!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Although I limit the amount of time my son gets to play on the computer, if he could, he'd be playing minecraft, eating or sleeping.<br />When he plays, the other siblings gather around to watch and give him tips.  Seems to be a very creative outlet for him, and much better than most other games for kids.
B001EYK52O|5.0|It takes you back to the world of the '60s, which in some ways is not so different from ours -- just  better. The music is great; I have the album. Steve McQueen and Faye Dunaway are wonderful as is Jack Weston in his mildly annoying way. The Boston background, especially Crown's house (which really exists in Louisburg Square), really adds punch to the movie. My only quibble is that the background in some scenes is so dark you can't tell what it is. This is characteristic of Jewison films -- he must be averse to paying a good lighting man. Anyway, the music, acting, script, setting, story all come together to make a wonderful timeless classic.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|i play this app everyday.  i love this app. you can get pics from facebook and other places without downloading! u can use your own gallery. I use tthis with my kindle fire.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Fantastic book.  Impatiently waiting for the sequel.  Books of this sort should be must reads for high school and college students.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|It is exactly what it says - Just the original 8 films (as if they were taken from their original cases) re-packaged together in one convenient place.
B0072NWKEC|3.0|The style of writing is not my favorite so therefore I was not as enthrall end with the book.  I rad it after a visit to Prague and was basically disappointed in the read.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Its perfect. Exactly what i needed for my fire. What else is there to say about a case. Omg this review...
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This book should be required reading in high school and college courses so students can learn the history of WWII in a way this would hold their interest.  Anxiously awaiting the three book in the series!
1250012570|5.0|This book is a wonderful story about two high school misfits who find each other and the wonderful relationship that develops.  An easy read that will keep you turning the pages.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|I did not read the books but this is an interesting story so far. I watch it from time to time. Not addicting but good
0375842209|5.0|I purchased this book for my 13 year old daughter.  It is a required reading book for her English class this year.  Since it seemed to be a fairly substantial book, I decided to read it over the summer so I could help her along in the event that she struggled.  By the third page I was hooked.  This book is a wonderful story about friendships and relationships during very difficult times.  I feel that after having read it, my life has been changed.  Since having read it, I loaned it out to my other two daughters and my mother.  Because the book was so well read, I had to purchase a new copy for my 13 year old's class...
B009LQKHIO|5.0|First time I read anything by Jill.Sanders . I loved the book. I couldn't put it down. Looking forward to reading more of  her books and the rest of this  series.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I love the tv series so much, then I saw the book so  had to read it, thoroughly enjoyed it, very interesting, and eye opening.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Another great novel by Sylvia Day!! Was so happy for it to come out, exactly what I expected! Definitely read this!
B004I1K430|5.0|Loved this film.  Of course the big draw is Colin Firth who does a wonderful job of portraying King George VI.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I enjoy this game. It just sucks that almost all the horses cost gems. Well that so much of the good stuff requires so many gems.
B002JXK5VU|5.0|I love this show. I wish they made more episodes.  The cast is a perfect combination of super smart and super dumb, but handsome male actors.  Same as the women.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|If you like comic book movies and/or action films this is an easy pick. It's pretty well done. Highly entertaining.
B00C1BTN6S|5.0|The cast and story make this a movie to watch again and again. I would highly recommend it to anyone.
B008JFUO4U|2.0|I wanted to like oblivion, but it was moon meets walle, meets tron legacy, meets the island with a little mad max or water world in it. Production was way to expensive, they went to iceland but it looks cg anyway. It wasnt an original story, and unfortunately tom couldnt carry the whole movie. Morgan was in it for like 3 minutes. and jamie lannister was under utilized. I was hoping for more. Side note the music was good.
0812968255|5.0|Snagged it after recommendation from reddit.. glad I did. The book is great and the forward has a ton of useful information to help put it all in context.

B008RA3X5E|5.0|I really enjoy this alarm clock.  It's super easy to use and I love that I can choose my own music to wake me up.
B00BEIYMTW|5.0|We rarely go to the theatre, but Planes was a must!  We all really enjoyed it.  Yes, it is similar to Cars, but how often can you take your children to a movie and not be afraid of inappropriate content or adult innuendos.  My husband and I, as well as our children really enjoyed Planes.  We enjoyed that it promoted unselfish loyalty.  That is sorely missing in our culture today!!
B00985E3UG|5.0|well written and easy to read.  author has great resources and has done excellent research.  for anyone who wonders why the obesity epidemic continues in america, read this book and understand why!
B009QW85ZU|4.0|Even though this movie is a rehash of Thunderball, the 'old man' has still got it!  Bite it, Daniel Craig!!
B00EFNXPFK|5.0|I love John's new album. Very country like and I love country music. I listen to it every night before I go to bed.
0316228583|4.0|The author creates some interesting characters and situations.  While parts of it are grim and sad, it kept my attention and I found the ending to be good, though inevitably sad.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|I bought this for my wife's Kindle and she loves it, it protects it as advertised<br />I recommend it - it is also available in other colors
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|Come on, for those who give Pacific Rim a 1 star...fine, what were you looking for? For those who enjoyed this movie, do you remember Ultraman and Godzilla? Cheesy, yes, Fun certainly and they were created by Mr. Tanaka, Mr Honda, & Mr Tsubaraya to name few from that time period, who would be geeking too, if they saw Pacific Rim! Pacific Rim look like it was so much fun to make for all of those who made this movie. This movie comes along and just blows me away by the special effects, pilots' suits, the details, the monsters, just freaking awesome!  I had to see this movie 6 times, yes 6 times. I was geeking and fangirling! I love the soundtrack! The only point that I am making, don't get the DVD if you are looking for something, whatever it is, it is not in this movie. Its inner child hood and ITS ROBOTS AND MONSTERS, period! Geek on!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|I originally saw this in 3D when it first came out. It is the BEST on our new 3D TV !!!
0385733577|5.0|This book arrived one day later than expected but not because of Amazon. Fedex &#34;smartpost&#34; is not so smart and they drop it off at the post office which takes longer than it should. The book is in great condition and has that new book smell. No rips or tears on it which is great. My husband LOVES this book.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Compelling.Amazing blend of fiction with actual historical tragedy. Highly recommended. Ken Follett and his staff are all masters at what they do.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Saw the movie, but needed to have the DVD. It arrived the same day as the release and when I watched it, I realized I had forgotten much of it.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|The story takes a look at common people, and how life evolves around them. It looks at historical events in the lives of these people and how these events effect them, and those around them.  A story of sacrifice, pain, and joy woven into a tremendous climax, that captivates the reader
B0026KX6TY|4.0|Greesers and socies is about which side of the track you grew up on. What type of music you liked and who you hung out with. Good action. A little unrealistic at times.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Nice drama - like House MD for the corporate lawyers. Makes you feel good - good guys and the little guys mostly win mixed in with a little sizzle.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I don't have time to keep playing this game, so why am I still playing it? There's very little strategy, not a lot to think about, and I could , should be reading a book instead.  It must have something to do with the need to clear my mind while still awake or something.  I don't know why, but I know it's fun and addictive!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|As it says, nice and lite weight. Not heavy, as the equipment is heavy enough!<br />Looked at others that were 5 lbs. Check the specs out on this one.<br />SS
B0093LFXIG|5.0|It's amazing to hear all that went on and that just like everyone else they had struggles too. This book is an enjoyable eye opener and I recommend it highly to anyone even if they have no idea who McFly is (seriously though if you don't know McFly...) Amazing Awesome Out of this World book!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|Knowing next to nothing about North Korea, I was<br />fascinated and disturbed by this richly imagined<br />account of the hero's journey through what must be<br />one of the strangest society's ever. It's tempting to<br />accept Johnson's fictional account of that sad country<br />as true. At the same time, he is able to portray the<br />terrible choices available to the citizen's of this Orwellian<br />society.His account of the role that pain plays in the<br />organization of psychological life was as fascinating as it<br />was disturbing.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Love the books! Started the first and haven't been able to stop. Look forward to the next, before I even finish the present.
B001O53BK6|3.0|My teenage son selected this movie for movie night.  It was pretty late and I was tired, but I managed to stay awake.  It had some funny parts, and the rest of the family liked it.

B0097EWK3A|4.0|Great story line and graphics. This was a great game until the very end. It froze at the ruins when I put code in incorrectly. I had to restart the whole game just to play the last 5 minutes of the game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose the rating because this book was so intense.<br />I also chose it because it was a page Turner
B00CDUVDEC|1.0|I follow and pretty much love everything Phil has ever been involved with, just not feeling this one at all!! So disappointed when I heard this CD. Sounds like he was in a very pissed off mood, messing around in the recording studio, it's that bad, then again of course he's always pissed off lol.I tried to listen again, & it confirmed my first opinion.IMO it is the worst project Phil has encountered EVER!!

B002WV5A9G|4.0|Great, entertaining fun!  Haven't been a fan of Star Trek anything since junior high, but this movie, along with the first Chris Pine vehicle, have been just the right combination of fun, suspense, and reshaping of old story lines. Loved it!
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|fairway is a great game.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|Your supposed to be able to add pple through game circle or game loft i have tried many different ways and CANT get any where with this. Other than that I love the game but this issue is getting annoying :(
B00CO4KGYA|4.0|Played this type of game before, some were bad and some were good.  This is definitely one of the better ones.  Good physics, challenging puzzles and you get to bean clowns in the face!  What more could you want.
B00CATSONE|2.0|Tesla was a great man.  We have a lot of things (like alternating current) to thank him for.  But he did not invent radar or some of the other things the biographer claims mean old Edison took credit for.
B00EF460ME|5.0|This turned my Kindle Fire into a great sound instead of the tinny high pitched one it had. Great buy, anyone that listens to music on theirs should have it.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Slow at first but a good read! Hoping the series turns into movies like the Twighlight series did! The stories keep getting better!
B005BGBPBG|2.0|This is an okay movie. Just not my type of movie. Cheesy chick flick! Something to watch when bored. This is a movie that I probably would not watch again on purpose
B00EHMG358|5.0|I was not surprised at all that White Fire is a an edge of the seat page turner . I have read all of the Pendergast books and he never disappoints. I cannot wait to read the whole story.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|If you take your eyes off the screen, you may miss something important! This was a very good movie, will watch again, thinking about buying it.
B008XG1X18|4.0|I was used to using the app on my iphone when I got this version for my Kindle Fire. This app is just not quite as user friendly as the Iphone app. And it's not really intuitive either. It took me a little bit to figure out where my &#34;home&#34; button was and those kind of things. Once you figure it out...it's fine, but it still could use a little tweaking to make it more user friendly, IMO.
B008XX6J4C|2.0|I would suggest you listen to a few tracks before purchasing... wish I had.  It could simply not be my taste, verging on elevator music.
B0035JNTA6|1.0|What a lousy movie.  I like Ben Stiller in general, But his role this is very predictable And not funny at all.
B00991TCOG|4.0|Love her wild mix of violen with new age electronica!  perfect balance, love almost every track!  Pandora radio orginally suggested I'd &#34;like&#34; her music & this cd certainly doesn't dissapoint!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game.  Great for any time you need to increase your blood pressure!  Just wish more of my friends played.
B00BB8Q13A|3.0|I love the characters and the actors.  It is a cute story and good for a mindless afternoon inside.  Pretty much a chick flick.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A delightful story with plenty of magic for the imagination.  I wanted to see Lettie come back, maybe it will be another story.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Prior to the Chromecast my wife and I had been playing the game where to watch something on the TV we had to grab a laptop, a charger, an HDMI cable and precariously position all on the edge of the TV stand (which unsurprisingly wasn't designed for a TV and a laptop side by side).<br /><br />Chromecast completely fixes the problem... now when we want to watch Netflix we just sit on the couch, turn on the TV and open up Netflix on my phone and cast it to the TV! It doesn't drain my phone battery like it would if we we're watching on my phone.<br /><br />Setup was relatively easy and straightforward (didn't take more than 15-20mins). One note, if you have a duel band router the Chromecast and all of the devices you want to control it on need to be on the same band.<br /><br />I've been *very* happy with the purchase.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|This book had all of the elements of a classic romance without falling into expected, overused cliches. I would definitely read another work from this author.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This board game is a lot of fun. So far me and my friends gave really enjoyed it. Inly downside is that expansion to get more players involved are costly
1250030951|5.0|Fangirl, by Rainbow Rowell, is absolute perfection. This book has it all--perfectly flawed characters you can't help but root for, realistic-yet-funny dialog, warm fuzzies and painful disappointments, well written \\"fanfiction\\" that was as good as the actual book itself, romance, family drama, everything. I couldn't put it down, I didn't want it to end. Rowell is a genius and every time I laughed, cried, ached or sighed in this book, I thought to myself, \\"This woman is an amazing writer. Where has she been hiding?\\" As much as I loved Rowell's book Eleanor & Park, I loved Fangirl even more (which I didn't think possible). This book is a great read and one I highly recommend. Now, if only there were a sequel...
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I played this game on my Kindle,  and I had no problems.  This was my first time playing an escape game an I could not put it down.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Muse never disappoints.  Recently saw them in concert.  This cd is another of their greats.  Buy everything Muse.  It's well worth the money.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It is only one game and quick to get through.  Not much of a challenge.  I like to play a variety of solitaire games.  This one's too easy.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|I love the action and that bit of humor.<br />If I could I would buy all of them, but I am<br />on a fixed income.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I like the many different boards presented.  Each presents a different challenge.  And I do like the fact of the shaded squares that are unavailable to play!
B005HEFB6M|4.0|I started watching Enterprise when it first aired years ago. I really enjoy seeing how Starfleet and eventually the Federation got it footings. Season opener off to a swift start, then some of the episodes move a little slower than others. This season sets the stage for all of the adventures to come!
B005LW5J9O|4.0|The book links the interest of the humanists in the early XV century for the classical manuscripts to the reform, to the iluminism and even to the American revolution. The narrative follows one specific work, the poem On the Nature of Things from Lucretius, rescued from a German abbey by an Italian humanist. The work contains the seeds of Epicureanism, which would latter influence and shock people on different times and help to form what we call the modern view of the human being and introduce the concept of the pursuit of happiness. Very good, well written and mind expanding.
B00AZKCU7G|5.0|Brilliantly directed by Steven Spielberg-his best since SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, IMHO-with a performance by Daniel Day-Lewis that does not just impersonate Abraham Lincoln but embodies him, LINCOLN is one of those rare historical dramas that does not try to give the essence of a man by giving us a pageant of their entire life but does so by taking one segment and illustrating within that segment what made this great man tick.  Supported by an extraordinary cast including Tommy Lee Jones, Sally Field, James Spader, Gloria Reuben, Hal Holbrook, David Strathairn and S. Epatha Merkerson (in a powerful cameo) with beautiful behind-the-scenes work from Janusz Kaminski on camera, John Williams with music, Michael Kahn's editing, a brilliant script by Tony Kushner from Doris Kearns Goodwin's book &#34;Team of Rivals,&#34; this is one of Spielberg's greatest achievements.  Get the 4-disc set-has more extras than the standard Blu-Ray edition and well worth it.
B00422LESO|4.0|I have never been able to read through a whole Jane Austen book, but I really liked this book, and the recently released movie.  I laughed at several parts of both the book and the movie.  It's a nice, light book.
B00B4Z5GDQ|4.0|Was an enlightening and inspiring history of where the studio music came from.  Thank you David Grohl. Nice documentary.  Awesome.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|Read aloud to the family and they enjoyed it immensely. Classic literature that inspired a great movie. The movie is somewhat different however.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory. It is clever and funny.  If you haven't seen it, you need to give it a try. The Big Bang Theory is the best show on TV, besides the Simpsons.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|I'd heard a lot about this show but until I saw the first season, I didn't realize how great it would be. Totally involved me, kept my interest and make me wanting more.
B00005JM02|5.0|The 2-disc set was in great condition and our 2-year old is OBSESSED. We're so glad we made the purchase.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Wow, a powerful and insightful book. It gives you experiments to show you that what you think really does create your reality. I read it and recommended to my husband. Sent one book to my sister and showed my daughter one of the experiments that she is using in her group and one on one therapies. Go, buy this book now, it will change the way you think about everything!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Every song a winner.<br />I always love the way Andrea delivers a song, so much feeling.<br />No matter which language, it's all in the passion.
B001L4I43O|5.0|Should be required viewing for any American history course covering this period in time.  It presents Malcolm in a fair, thorough, and interesting way.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|This is a poignant story about good and evil and the resiliency of the human spirit.<br />In a time when many are led to believe that evil does not exist,  this book is a reminder that evil is real and sometimes living in normal every day people.  If you haven't yet read this book,  get ready to meet Cathy!
B004CR5TD0|5.0|A massively deep rich vocal projector with electric timbre James Blake is a touch of amazing.  The repetitious lyrics are methodic yet engaging to make the rhythm flow.  I really like his style of blending traditional vocal with new age musical melodies.  He is definitely up & coming.
B00AYB0TOW|3.0|This version of the Judge Dredd story is a decent film. It was great to turn off the judgment part of my mind and just enjoy a movie. Lots of shooting and killing. Just a good shoot em' up kind of show.
B00D7Z4GQY|1.0|I was not happy with this selection.  I would not recommend it for good reading material.  Does not hold your interest for long.
B00CTSDDVO|3.0|I was never a fan of the TV show and bought this because I pick up all 3D movies.  The 3D was done well but thought the story lacked big time.
B00DQVST76|5.0|DVD format workd reat No problems with sound  or image I did notice the Filming  was extremely modified  but I understand this is Madonnas vision and artistry  in  the works so  I aknowledge and respect her and her production team for that  THIS IS NOT THE SAME AS SEEING HER LIVE But  having seen her live 5 times  this  concert format BLEW MW AWAY!!! It is the only way that such intricate detail  could be  apreciated  THIS IS ONE COMPLEX TOUR  and a lot of  work, tecnology, effort  and creativity  went into  producing it This version captures it all The  emotion the fans, the dancers  the lights the musicians  and Madonna shines Bright  in it! ( after all she IS  the Star!)  I highly recommend anyone  even non Madonna fans  to purchase this  concert YOU  WILL NOT REGRET IT! Again  I cannot stress enough the fact  that this is not the same as watching her live  It is a step beyond that in my opinon. Lots of memorable moments! this will go on to be one of her best  documented works  of all times! LOVE IT RECOMEND IT!
B00DQVSTCG|4.0|First, let me explain something. Those who bought the show and complain about the messy audio and video quality, please note that it's the Europeean release. I bought it at a Best Buy store in Canada and everything is perfect. The only thing that pisses me is that there is two options: You can buy only the show (on Bluray) OR you can buy the 3 discs set that contains two live CD from the show and the DVD of the tour. It pisses me of that I can't have the two live CD with the BLURAY in one purchase.... For my part, I just bought the bluray and I'm very satisfied by the quality.
B000059MEK|5.0|This album is a must own for daft punk fans and fans of electronic music or if you just need music to listen to while you work.<br />5 stars defiantly worth the money.
B00C32R64G|5.0|Great sounding band. This was the first album I have heard from them. I would recommend this to everyone who likes good rock music.
B009E3EY38|5.0|A great record of this once in a lifetime event .......... the undeniably greatest rock band of all time !
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|OK! I have not seen the movie yet...<br />I pre-ordered it, knowing I would be deployed (military) when it came in and I could have my family send me my digital code and get access to it. So I received my access code, which did not work. I submitted a trouble ticket with Paramount to help resolve the issue.They turned around and within a day I had a new code. I am thinking, AWESOME! I go back to the redeeming page, and now it is country code blocked. I am done with Paramount.<br /><br />Fortunately Flixster was not country code blocked, but it will not let me stream from it. My guess is the country code. So I have to download it, and it is currently ticking. From what I have read, it may count as &#34;Premium Content&#34; which means I can download it a total of 3 times, then it is worthless. The even better part is, I cannot stream it from UltraViolet's site now, it just redirects to Flixster. Who knows if they would even let me stream the content I bought while in a foreign country?<br /><br />Paramount, even if the movie is the best thing since sliced bread, I am never buying your products again. I am going to say you are doing an amazing job of combating piracy when you screw over those who are willing to spend the money on products they will enjoy.<br /><br />Amazon, THANK YOU for the amazing shipping time and for not screwing me out of the content I have purchased. Keep up the good work.
B00DHQHAH0|5.0|I really like the characters in this show. They're fantastic, they grow, change,  develop.<br />The dynamic between Harvey and Mike is awesome too.
B00932A4XE|4.0|Fun and heart-warming :-) This is a funny portrayal of several couples and their experiences with having a baby. Lots of laughs and a few tears.
B0036S4B6M|3.0|Did not enjoy the story.  It was the realization that is doesn't matter your morals and values as you become part of the environment that the existing environment can change you to be part of the culture there.  Just not my type of read.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|Enjoyed the book very much but since it jumped around, I needed to keep reading to keep the characters straight
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Love this movie Tom Cruise always plays a great roll.  The action scenes are amazing an life like,  Very Pleased!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This lets your phones flash for the camera become a powerful flashlight. It also lets your screen become a flashlight. Very cool app.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|Love this move even though it is a love story I really enjoyed the watching this and the story line was amazing.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|The author places the biblical Jesus within the historical context of the Roman occupation of the center of Hebrew civilization and thereby gives meaning and understanding the objectives of his movement.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Funny and sympathetic account of the impact of mental illness.  I laughed out loud in places and teared up in others.
B0060V1WJ6|1.0|Same old sexist ethos. serial dater/cum man whore falls &#34;in love&#34;.Alcohol saves the girl.<br />pile of predictable codswallop.. nice bachelor pad for the movie stars.
B00BRUQ7ZY|3.0|After first three chapters, not much new information. Lacked forward momentum. Many biblical references, but not as many non-bilical historical references to give a sense of the &#34;times&#34;.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I am a newbee to Twitter but it's been a bunch of fun so far...I was told it's the one place you go to scream at the world...I am currently following friends till I get the nerve but am still very much enjoying it...Thanks
B00AHHODH2|4.0|Lots of characters with an interesting and sometimes surprising web of stories and backgrounds.  Characters were well painted and placed in the plot.  Was the expected end ever going to happen?  Sure did not expect the authors unique and intriguing ending.  Could there be more?  But wouldn't that spoil what your imagination has pictured?
148951418X|4.0|I am very pleased with this book. It shows you a variety of different mounts and even ones you can make for your go pro plus shows you different lighting and ways to edit the videos.. must buy
B003OUXECE|3.0|I've played all the Bioshock games so I knew most of the backstory. What happens in this book is interesting but it is a bit slow getting there. However, if you really must know how Rapture came to be then definitely read this.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Fantastic game, well worth the price. It helps deal with the magic bug you get when you really want to play but none of your buds are available
B00DKY4LBW|4.0|Not very many bands make it to five albums nowadays, and to keep coming out with great material is even more of a challenge.  One of may favorite comparisons is the evolution of \\"The Jam\\" - Their fifth album \\"Sound Affects\\" is considered by many to be their best album, and while AM isn't the best Arctic Monkees album, it still a strong and consistent release that still leads me to believe that they will be making fantastic music for a long time to come.
B008I43DYU|5.0|Love it because of the big numbers and also when you turn your Kindle sideways it turns into more of an advance calculator.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|one of the best story I have read this year. Excellent style of writing, interesting, and well structured. The plot is keeping attention all the time and I thought the charters were well defined.  Really brilliant.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay the final book of The Hunger Games series was phenomenal it was packed with heartbreak, heartache, triumph and more. It doesn't have the Hollywood happy ending it has a realistic ending which is bittersweet. I'd recommend the entire Hunger Games Series
0553593714|5.0|Many have seen the television series based on this ongoing work which began with Book One Game of Thrones. If you are watching the shows you should go back and read the stories it is based on. It really helps with an overall understanding of the characters and story line-though the show follows along fairly closely.
B008Y6RGFE|4.0|Feel good chick flick that is made for guys....Old standb.  Nice to see the dance move seen again...perfect!  Enjoy the movie
B002APU580|5.0|I've seen this version of P & P as well as the mini series.  Love both of them.  I think they are both equal in talent.  I really can't decide which I favor more.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I read this book in a day....it was just that good... I loved the relationship he has with his therapist... i am not a football fan and I even loved the way the characters all kind revolved around it..
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was written as a book for tweens and early teens, but it is a book adults can enjoy as well.  Well written and engaging, it took me back to my elementary school days and reminded me of how wonder, and painful, those days were.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I like the interactions even though it is predictable. mindless and easy to catch up on. Its like a soap opera for guys. no real violence no hard plots to try and keep up with during my busy life.
B004EPZ03Y|5.0|Fun movie for muppet fans.  The music was really fun and some that can be sing alongside forever.  All the same silliness that goes with the muppets.
B009TZ7WDK|5.0|Jonathan and Charlotte will transport you to a world of unforgettable magical music.  A true delight to listen to. Simply amazing!
B005544TRQ|5.0|We are truly addicted to this show. Can't wait to see what is in store at this firm in the upcoming seasons.
B008OM0EDO|4.0|Thia movie was hilarious. There may have been some inapproprate scenes, but still it was very funny. The combination of politics, romance and laugh was amazing!
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|Love it!! It keeps my daughters attention while on car rides. I would recommend this movie for any parent and their child
B00AC8ZJPQ|3.0|I am not a Halo fan although a have obviously played it. I enjoyed the game a lot but a game is a game.<br />The acting in the movie is surprisingly good taking in account the age of the actors.<br />The plot is also fine but it is far from gripping. You pretty much know what will happen on every turn.<br />Overall nice little flick to watch but if I had to pay to watch it I wouldn't (I am with Amazon Prime)
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Try this clock........  Has all the functions I needed and Works well for me and the price was right!  I think you'll like it.  Waking with music is great and nice selection of songs.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|I downloaded this for my nephew, but it was not at all what we were expecting.  I took it off the kindle that same night.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I started reading this series near the beginning of it's creation way back in the 90's and put it down halfway through. It really seemed like it was never going to end and a lot of the books seemed to just fill in space in the timeline with little happening to move the plot forward. I loved the main characters and all (Robert Jordan's view of relationships takes some getting used to), but it seemed to get tedious. After reading this book I have a much better appreciation for the others and why they were the way that they were. This book was a lot better than the rest, more so because of the journey it took to get here. This is the only book that I can say I didn't want to put down. When I heard that the final book was coming out at the beginning of this year, I started at the beginning and read straight through to the end. It took me just under a year of casual but continuous reading, but I can now say that the story is 90% complete. The wheel of time will continue to turn, my heart bleeds to the characters lost, and my mind wonders what's next for those who carry on.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|i like all the different options when playing, like against another player or being able to play online or against the computer.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|The new level update (Moon update)  forces close and forces some of the other levels to close also. Please fix the bug so I can play the new level. Will change review when fixed.
B0095VPBFY|5.0|If all you do is browse the net, some online web games and so forth, this is the CPU to get. IT's snappy, you can OC it a bit to get a little more speed out of it, and it'll play some lighter games.<br /><br />I ran DOTA2 on max. I play that game religiously so when I'm out of town at my parents house, I can at least play it haha.
B004X2M9VY|4.0|David Tennant is still my favorite Doctor. I like Matt Smith, but not Moffat. Nor am I an Amy and Rory fan, so the season was slightly drawn out.
B003Z39G0O|1.0|I was very disappointed when I received the Vampire Diaries Soundtrack CD that I ordered from Amazon. The samples of the album that Amazon shows has \\"Obsession\\" by Sky Ferreira as the number 8 song, but in fact on the CD is \\"Under the Stars\\" by Morning Parade. I like the songs on the CD but I purchased it because of the song Obsession. Boo Amazon. Looks like false advertising to me. I'm sending it back.
B00CKR63F2|5.0|**I received a copy of this book in exchange for an honest review and I am giving one**<br />I am not used to reading YA books but Sheryl does such an awesome job of drawing the readers into the world she has created that I enjoyed the book very much and did not get bored. Thank you for the review copy, Sheryl!!! I feel completely honored. This story makes me wish I could shape shift and change the weather with my mood. Let's not forget the young love and magic! I would suggest this book to anyone who loves Fantasy. It's a great read!
B0083Z614S|5.0|This is one of my all time favorites from teaching.  Lots of deeper meaning  in the book.  I loved reading it again.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|What's there not to like. This is the top action movie of the year so far. A Trekies dream. Hopefully another sequel.
1593072937|5.0|I bought the books for my son and he really enjoyed them.  We are looking forward to the next volumes.
B001LOPYHI|5.0|I missed this movie - it does not make the reruns.  Now I can see it whenever I want to.  Thanks Amazon
B00D3NSDVO|5.0|Terry Hayes has written one of the best ever first novels. As an Israeli born in Turkey, I couldn't imagine all the research that went into it to make it  99.9 % accurate. The story develops on different levels keeping the reader alert and unable to put down the book from beginning to end. As my writer friend who recommended it said: I wish I hadn't finished it....<br />Thank you Mr. Hayes.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|this is a great product.  Its easy to use, and saves time. The dog had eaten the old one.  so getting this from Amazon so fast was great.
0439023491|5.0|Really good read. Keeps you really interested. It is definitely a page turner. Recommend read all three. Great story line.
B00992CF6W|5.0|He has minecraft on his at home game system.  This portable one gives him more moves and he can go into his &#34;world&#34; , make adjustments, and he says it is so much better with the touch screen.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|It was a well planned script. Very innovative. Had good magic tricks. Characters were funny. Definitely a must see movie for the year.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Love playing solitare, very happy to find this app for the Kindle Fire. Great game, only issue is all the pop-ups but they are understandable since it was a free game!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|w why so awesome awesome awesome cool amazement.  cool coolest. fun joyful l makes time go by booya fun again. almost like pie
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I am left hanging. This book was fifty shades of crazy.  Ana is fifty shades of stupid.  Christian was fifty shades of weird. And the ending was fifty shades of disappointing. Jeez...Smh
140006922X|4.0|Anyone who's bothered to study biblical history in the slightest know that the gospels are filled with fiction and inaccuracies--what Aslan does is create a more cohesive narrative on who Jesus really was (though sometimes he actually plays it too safe)--and who Jesus was, was a badass. This is a depiction of Jesus that is far removed from the anglo-saxon hippie that has been portrayed for far too long, and is instead a far more interesting figure. If this challenges your beliefs, that is good--if it makes you doubt, even better. If you aren't willing to test your faith, then you don't really have any. Aslan is not trying to destroy your faith, if anything, he is adding another layer to it. And if you are not Christian, this book gets rid of the \\"in your face\\" Jesus thrown around, and proves him to be more like MLK and Ghandi (but, you know, willing to use some violence). And if you hate Christians, this book will separate Jesus from his pesky followers.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Have enjoyed this series really late in the game. Was in residency while everyone else was watching it on TV.
B005LFS3ZS|5.0|Soulful, serene, absolute perfection.  I have Ben's cds and LP, and for the full listener experience - BUY THIS ALBUM TODAY.  True Musicianship at its finest.  Can't rave enough.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is a lot of fun. The challenges are reasonable and you don't have to spend money on it, just be persistent. The levels are creative and fun. I definitely recommend this game for all ages.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Thoroughly enjoy his writing and descriptions.<br /><br />I wanted another generation.<br /><br />How long do we have to wait for the next book?
B000I9YLUI|5.0|My absolute favorite movie. Every scene is fantastic. The characters are played by incredible actors, particularly Keira and Matthew. Love!!
B00DGKVW9Y|5.0|I don't write reviews but I felt compelled to weigh in on this product.  If you care about music but are using your phone or Ipod, do yourself a huge favor and buy this device.  You will be amazed.  It can easily drive any set of headphones with plenty of volume and the sound quality is taken to a whole different level.  My initial reaction when first experiencing the sound was that I was in the studio listening to the actual recording.  It's that good!
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|I love the game but, it takes too long to scratch the cards. It freezes up. And, we should be able to get more than one token for leveling up. Last week, I lost tokens and my ranking.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|This is a great show.  Keeps you interested.  Can't wait till the next episode comes on.  Love watching it.  k
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|its not what i was looking for at all i was looking for candy crush saga and that was what popped up
B005544TRQ|3.0|It's so predictable! However it's amusing and well acted. The whole cast seem to be from a fashion modeling agency.
B008JFUO36|5.0|We really enjoyed this movie, so we were surprised to see if sale so quickly at such a good price. Delivery time was good.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is an awesome invention for an even more awesome price. As soon as it got out I ordered it figuring that for the price it was worth to try even if it ended up being something we didn't use much. Turns out we love it and use it a lot!<br />We can see any video we play on the Chrome browser directly on our tv. It also streams video from Netflix and YouTube.<br />The only problem is that apparently you can't cast from Chrome on a Samsung tablet, at least not yet, so we have to cast from our PC which is an adjoining room and we have to get up to the computer if we need to pause or rewind or anything. Netflix and YouTube can be cast from the tablet no problem. This can be a bit uncomfortable but still better than crowding around the computer monitor.<br />I recommend getting it in addition to a Roku or Apple TV or other streaming apparatus. We have a Roku and prefer to use that for Netflix and Amazon Prime, it's better video resolution plus it's more convenient having the remote to control the video.<br />However, there are plenty of videos you can't get on a streaming device like the US Open tennis we were able to stream entirely from their site. It's a wonderful little device, highly recommended. For the price there's no excuse for not getting one.
B005HEPS6A|5.0|TNG is my favorite Star Trek Series, hands down! All seasons are great; I love the metaphors found within each program.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The show is very entertaining. I started watching out of curiosity and I got hooked. This season has a lot of drama with trouble in every corner. Good show with great actors.
B0047Y17P2|5.0|A classic lawyer novel. Really good and the kind of book that you want to read every day before bed.
B00BEBJEY2|5.0|Much different from the other Mogwai album I have (Zidane: A 21st Century Portrait Soundtrack), but still soothing and good ambient music.  Has some vocals and a little more upbeat.  I love it for an afternoon cocktail or background music while I'm reading.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I thought the story was a little cheesy, but the movie was a cinematic wonder.  I know it's all part of nature, but I hate watching animals die.
B0091X2K0A|5.0|Greatest movie ever made. Well the first half anyways. I usually only watch the basic training. I recommend it,two thumbs up.
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|I just viewed the Blu ray product of the MDNA tour of Madonna and its fantastic ! She did a great show and the final product on this Blu ray is excellent ! She did an excellent job editing all the footage and making them more engaging to watch.<br />I did notice that it took almost two minutes for the Sharp Blu ray player to read the disc, but after that, everything went smoothly. The video is definitely shot high definition 1080p. I did notice though that the TV or the Bluray player rendered the video at 24hz instead of the usual 120 hz.  This may be that disc requires a TV that can render the film in 24 fps. My Sharp TV bought five years ago can render that, as well as my Sharp Blu ray player. I'm not sure if all HDTVs have that capability but that may be the reason why I'm seeing issues being posted about the blu ray version of the concert film.<br /><br />(My Sharp TV and blu ray player have the latest firmware updates and connected to a Sony sound bar.<br />I also choose the Master HD 2.0 audio option for playing on the sound bar.)<br /><br />Update 09/14/13: Since I play the disc using the DTS Master 2.0 option, I don't see the issue with regards to the 5.1 audio setting. My suggestion, try checking each speaker. The Maxell Blu Ray player cleaner also has audio check settings that will check the configuration of each speaker.  Otherwise, just enjoy the concert in Master HD 2.0. It sounds great !
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I love it! Watch it is a great show.  Can't wait for season 4, I stay up to watch the first two seasons
B00136RVUC|5.0|It just doesn't get any better than Texas Flood by Stevie Ray Vaughan.  From &#34;Mary had a little Lamb&#34; to &#34;Pride and Joy&#34; a rock-n-blues album that delivers.
B00ARF93AQ|4.0|They did a good job of staying true to the character.  I was woried it would be a &#34;forced&#34; character, but they pulled it off. I enjoyed the movie.
B00E8JZILA|5.0|is very good game looks like the TV series difrutar hope much of this game i like the horror survivor
B005LAIIJY|2.0|This movie was horrible. This flick was not even a good western,all it turned out to be was a poorly done,race baiting,western. I'm suprised that it wasn't made by spike lee. the 2 stars was me being generous. This flim was a huge stinker.
B009NH6AOQ|4.0|I am very happy with the season three, now waiting for season four to begin on television.  I am a very avid Walking Dead viewer!  My son and his family got me started on this when AMC and DISH were having their dispute and they would come to my house and watch the program and I got hooked.
0307949486|5.0|The book is a great read.  I have difficult putting it down and getting to bed before midnight. It is well written and very entertaining.
0385340990|5.0|I first read this book as part of a book club and decided that I had to have a permanent copy for myself.  It's great having internet shopping to find, purchase, and enjoy.  Thanks
B00821OX98|5.0|I started this show because it was recommended, I cannot get enough of it. i have turned my husband onto the show and now we cannot wait for the next season.  It is a good mix of syfy and action with a little bit of a love story, perfect for anyone.
B004QX07G4|1.0|I adore Ellen and her talk show but the book was a big disappointment.  I expected much more than a running monologue peptalk about being nice to others and keeping your chin up.  I expected some insight into Ellen's personal life with Portia, which never happened at all in the book, and I was just disappointed overall.  I wouldn't recommend the book to anyone.  But I will continue to watch her show.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I truly enjoyed reading this book. The content kept me hanging on until the next time I read. Great book.
B009NH6JRE|5.0|Hands down the best season in the series. A few missteps does not stop this from being riveting and engrossing, edge of your seat entertainment. A few negatives, Rick's hallucinations, a little too long in another town with a boring character from Rick's group. Other than that, highly recommended.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|Great app! Excellent sounds, very soothing. I enjoy mixing my own combinations and have found the best combo that sends me straight into sleep mode.  The timer is convenient at bedtime, so I don't run the battery down.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Good story line and good ending. The movie does leave you with a question but it is good all the way through. It is on the top of our entertaining movie list.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Safe haven and all books by Nicholas Sparks are the best books ever! Nicholas is my favorite author. I've been convincing people to read his books because I'm hooked. They are easy reads and incredibly addicting!
B007MU85D0|5.0|I am very happy with this album, great lyrics, beats, feel and vocals. The band has been around for a good while but just recently picked up by the mainstream ( i know hippies, cry it out...)

B005MVJM3I|4.0|I really enjoy Machine Head's music (except the rap phase--I'm glad that's over with).  This gets back to the hard and heavy sound that they are known for.  The seven original songs are really good (yes, there are only seven original songs).  That is the reason for four stars.  Don't get me wrong, the covers are well done (not a huge fan of &#34;Witch Hunt,&#34; but I can live with it) and the acoustic version of &#34;The Darkness Within&#34; sounds great.  I just think the band could have put at least ten new original songs and added the others as bonus material.  Seven songs...that's only slightly larger than an ep.  If you're a Machine Head fan, you should like this.

B008X9Z37A|4.0|it fits on the kindle fire perfectly.  allowing all the ports to be accessible.  however my nephew prefers to use teh kindle without the case and just like to hold the kindle in his hands.  but it gives it the neccessary protection.  he only uses  it on weekends when he's at my house, so the rest of the week, it's in its case, on my table, well protected.

B004SKHJF2|5.0|I accidentally hit the button before I was ready for it to identify the song.  I quickly tapped for it to stop listening.  With one second worth of listening, it correctly identified the tv commercial that was playing in the background.  That is pretty good.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I enjoy historical stories.  I was pleasantly surprised to find Brendan Coyle in this.  All the actors give great performances.  And the sets are so real.  All quite natural.  This series would be excellent for students to watch with a study guide asking appropriate questions.  Great series.  Will be sad when it ends.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Easy to set up and use, but there are so few apps (mainly Netflix and YouTube) it currently is not that useful.  With more available apps it would easily be four or five stars, especially at this price.  Would be nice to view Prime movies over this device.<br />*** tried the chrome browser extension to view prime videos. Picture and sound ok using flash as recommended.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I like the way the game flows... have played various presentations but I really like this for smoothness and class
B00ENTDDGW|1.0|Edited -- I have changed this so that it will not longer show up on this reviewing system. It was an error.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|the book is written in an almost childish manner, where concrete thinking rules. The story captivates you from the start: it tells the escape of a centenarian from a nursing home the day of his birthday. From then on, it turns into a very enjoyable  comedy of errors. All characters are very unique. It is a little jewel!
B00CATSONE|5.0|I agree with the reviewer who points out that this is not a full biography of Tesla, and I too thought that it would be when I started reading. That did not take away from my enjoyment of the book, though.<br /><br />Nikola Tesla is a fascinating man, and his accomplishements were many (and often misattributed). This book provides an overview of Tesla and what he accomplished, as well as an in-depth analysis of why he didn't accomplish more. It goes one step further, which is to share with the readers just how men of Tesla's greatness can fail to reach their full potential, using him as the case study for this main point.<br /><br />The e-book is well-formatted and easy to read, the material is interesting, and it is short and to the point. It may not tell you the whole story of Tesla, but the story that it does tell sheds a lot of light on his backstory and the outcome of his life. Those striving for greatness can take quite a bit away from the points that are made throughout this book.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I thought it was really good. I mean its based on a comic book so it cant be super realistic. But, it was very good for the entertainment factor.

B007SSEZNA|4.0|I love this movie, the acting is good and the story is interesting.  This is what I've always imagined women of this time doing to pass the time, idle gossip and matchmaking.  It cracks me up.

B0040HO01Y|5.0|Witty, Charming, and of course; entertaining. This series took me back to a time a bit more simple with emotions we share today. There's a character for everyone to relate with. There is so much trash TV out there. I found this to be a refreshing gem.
0525478817|5.0|How do you judge a book that puts on full display all of your deepest worries and fears? You don't. Not really. All you can do is just sit back and let it move you and then try to accurately explain the experience. So here it goes: The Fault in Our Stars by John Green is brilliant and intelligent, but mostly, it's just honest.<br /><br />There's something so... connected about The Fault in Our Stars. It makes you look at death in a realistic way, in a way that says this happens to everyone and will one day happen to you and how are you going to deal with it? Death is the one thing that connects every living thing. It doesn't matter who or what or where we are, we will die one day, no matter what. And it's sad and horrible, but, reading this book, death's not brushed over, it's not swept under the rug so we can have our fantasy of happily ever after, but it's also not as tragic as one would think. It's actually quite beautiful.<br /><br />The funny thing about The Fault in Our Stars is that it's full of this suspense. Not knowing whether a character will succumb to their body's illness is possibly the most suspenseful suspense can get. And then adding the whole Peter Van Houten mystery and its just so much. All I wanted was for Hazel and Gus to meet this guy, a guy who I could care less about, but they were so enthusiastic about it they made me enthusiastic for them. I couldn't wait to see their reactions.<br /><br />I have to say, in the beginning I was a little put off by some of the vocabulary used in this book. I mean, I have a pretty decent vocabulary, but there were times when I had to look up the definition of the words in the definition of the word I just looked up. Seriously! It's not a huge deal, but if I had to say one thing detracted from my enjoyment of the book, that was it, at least at first. It's something that grows on you as you read until eventually you can't imagine the book any other way. I'll say this though, John Green doesn't talk down to his readers. He expects them to keep up.<br /><br />There's something so odd about this book, because, unlike the hundreds of other books I've loved and then tried to push on people, I don't want to push this one on anyone. It's like Green says in the book, some books give you an evangelical zeal while others make you wish that no one but you knew of them at all. And I think it's because the beauty of John Green's words will not be felt by all who read them. I know so many people who wouldn't have this book touch them the way it touched me and there's something so sad about that. It's like commenting on how beautiful the stars are and having the person you're with shrug and say, \\"Yeah, sure.\\" It's like you're trying to share this piece of your soul with them and they can't see it. That might be a little bit dramatic, but it's how this book made me feel. It moved me in a way you can't always make other people understand. There are some things that are ruined when we try to share them with others. Some things that are better off kept to ourselves. The Fault in Our Stars is one of those things for me.readers.

B003B02O7I|5.0|One of Gresham's best works. The research that went into it is obvious .  A very good read by a brilliant author.
B00BJA2VFW|4.0|Enjoyed playing this game. But a few more levels would be great. Looking forward to the next game level. Hope its out soon.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|Kinda good at first, but it's kind of a moody book... I dunno, it didn't really mesh with me as well as I thought it would. Maybe I'll read it again, and see if I can get into it more.

B0090X4GJE|5.0|Her voice and her songs are hauntingly beautiful.  I like listening to it when I am winding down at night.  I got several of my friends hooked on this album.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Nothing at all like I thought it would be. I thought it was a stupid teenager movie but it turned out to be some pretty deep and dark material. I actually enjoyed it.

B00CM9JKQM|5.0|queensryche is back with a vengeance. Hard to believe a different singer could bring back the old ryche sound but they sound fresh and inspired.
B00CCEHR80|4.0|I recently purchased this album, volume 2, to add to my ever expanding collection of CD's & MP3 Library. My REVIEW IS BASED ON A COMPARISON TO VOLUME 1, which is 10 years before Volume 2. I absolutely love Volume 1, so after reading some reviews on this album, I decided to get this, to see the differences and decide what I like best. Some of the negatives (in my own, personal opinion)of this album (Versus Volume 1) would be:<br /><br />- 10 years have gone by, you can hear the difference in Jerry's voice. It starts to sound aged by this point.<br /><br />- Back up Vocals: For this live set, there are a couple of women singing as back up, which I find to be more distracting than pleasurable. For me, it takes some of the Rawness Jerry provides when singing alone or with the actual band. I don't think they added the female backup singers because they need to add something more to their music. I think they were just an addition to compliment the songs. I find however, this takes away the \\"raw\\" edge I feel and hear with out this feature.<br /><br />- Sound Quality: I notice that a lot of the album sounds more like a bootleg that was successful, but it doesn't compare to the clarity of volume one, but that was a different time, a different location, and other variables that play into the fact that this particular live event's sound isn't as clean.<br /><br />Some of the positives of this volume:<br /><br />- It's still the Jerry Garcia Band, and this is by no means a poor purchase. Additionally, it's still good ol' Jerry and friends. they Jam just the same as they have been for decades.<br /><br />- It has great songs, and some of the versions that are in volume 1 are played in volume 2. This is interesting to hear some of the differences in the way the songs are played out. No 2 sets are the same, and that is obviously one of the major pluses about the JGB and the Grateful Dead. They are true performers, and play live music on such a high level, as they have been doing for so many years.<br /><br />This album is worth buying if you are into JGB or the dead. Even if you are a casual listener, this is still a good purchase. If I had to choose one album over the other, I would go with Volume One. If Volume 1 never existed, and I bought volume 2, without the comparison being present, I would not be upset with purchasing this. It's worth it, but it's not favored over Vol. 1, in my opinion.
B0030ZOYJ0|5.0|I love this movie and the case is so awesome it came in great condition no mark are any thing wrong with the case or dvds its worth a buy for any anime collector or fan of the series
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Absolutely love this game.....so addicting and fun... and play on the go....haven't found one better yet. Even my son loves playing. Great for whole family.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|This opening season of the series sets the tone for the series. It's at least as dark as The Soprano's was, but set in a very different world. Sort of like watching a slow motion train wreck that keeps escaping the final cataclysmic and devastatingly ultimate conclusion. They keep lurching from situation to situation, from lie to lie and getting away with it. It's very dark, very human, plausible and human. I'm really hooked.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Why do people keep giving bad reviews? This is one of the best apps. From what Ive heard, IT HAS REALLLLY IMPROVED. Best FB app out there. Being free just makes it that much better
B001RTSPVY|5.0|I have not yet finished viewing the second season, I'm savoring it, but I am hooked and it's till an amazing ultra slow motion train derailment that you can't believe hasn't completely become unhinged yet. And that's because the main character is intelligent and manages to keep one step ahead of his own foolishness at the same time. It's scary good.
B005R32L66|4.0|I really enjoy using this app'it reallt comes in handy wwhem obgb,h i want to cjir chst with en frequency

B00DZP3KJ0|5.0|I always buy Scott Kelby's books for Photoshop/PhotoshopElements and when I purchased Lightroom 4 last year his book was the first purchase I made after downloading the software. When I upgraded to Lightroom 5, it took a few months for his book to come out and I was chomping at the bit to get my hands on it. I actually purchased the digital version for my Kindle Fire HD and then a few weeks later bought the actual book.<br /><br />His instructions are easy to understand and the features he goes over and explains are things I am wanting to know. If I am trying to find out how to do a certain thing in the software it is easy to find in the book using the index. I love his humor and it really comes out in his books.<br /><br />Scott Kelby is the best!
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|I'm a total Anglophile, and Broadchurch just added to that love.  The acting, the scenery, the story.  Felt like I lived there.  If you are a Masterpiece Mystery fan, don't miss Broadchurch
B00E5Q1HJS|5.0|I must say that when I heard the first Star Trek was coming out at the movies I had no intention of seeing it. I grew up watching the original TV series, the movies that cast made, and then went on to enjoy Generations and their movies. I didn't think anything could be done to make what had all ready been done better. Boy, was I wrong!<br /><br />My nephew made me watch the first when after it came out on DVD and I did so reluctantly but was soon sitting on the edge of my seat and enjoying the story as well as the acting. I couldn't wait for a secon one.<br /><br />Into Darkness certainly kept the excitement going. It had me laughing, crying, on the edge of my seat...It had it all!<br /><br />The story line was great and the acting just as incredible as the first one. This truly is a must see!
B009KS4XRO|2.0|Right now there is a petition going around in hopes that Caesars will make improvements to what was once a fun social network game.  Bingo players play Bingo to get and hear BINGO. Cards are too expensive here. Daily credit amounts have not increased appropriately as players level up so very often you have to wait days to play more than two rounds of Bingo simply because you don't have enough credits to do so. Many of my teammates have left Bingo Blitz and gone to GSN. Thet also have monitors slip into rooms who are pretty much useless other than to mute anyone who is frustrate with the game.  Freedom of speech is not allowed while playing which at times CAN be a blessing if there is perv or cusser playing.  It doesn't happen often but does happen so parents beware.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Loved it from the moment I started reading it until the very end.  I smiled, remembered, cried, got angry, and felt peace all from one book.......
B002LII6KA|4.0|great great collection of these movies!! thanks. I learned a lot about the philosophy behind these films by being able to watch and re-watch key scenes
B0090P98Z4|5.0|Awesome game!!! Very easy to play. Great graphics. Ur missing a great game if u dont try it!!! Almost like diablo but less magic.
B0067QPVJ6|5.0|I didn't want to pay top dollar iTunes price so I looked online and found it at a much better price. I thought the movie was pretty good. Lots of cool special effects. Same story line as the previous with Kurt Russell with a few changes here and there.
0553582461|5.0|Just finished reading the 6 books back to back.. What an amazing story line. After the Assassin's trilogy still wanted more of the Fitz and the Fool, and am so glad I skipped the Ship trilogy. If you read them as a set they are incredible. The Fool is utterly brilliant. After a long time a book had me teary eyed for the Fools Fate.    A bit rushed towards the end, some incomplete arcs perhaps, but it was the most satisfying completion. Utterly brilliant and staisfying. Am almost reluctant to start the Dragons or the Liveship series.. It cannot possibly get better.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|Honest information for anyone looking to be an innovator in a world where there fresh discovery seems out of reach.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|I originally had low expectations for this movie (even as a huge fan of<br />the Walking Dead, I'm feeling \\"zombie-fatigued\\"). But the idea that<br />zombies are both fast and \\"swarm\\" (like ants crawling on top of each<br />other) to climb a huge wall is a unique twist that could make this<br />movie fun to watch (written May 2013).<br /><br />And it ended up being a blast. It introduced an original story-line to<br />the zombie-apocalypse genre. First, an origin to why the zombie plague<br />started. Second, the potential for a cure? And lastly, Brad Pitt as the<br />best dad/survivalist ever. If I had to pick my team to battle the<br />zombie apocalypse, I'd want Brad on my team, no matter that he is 20<br />times more handsome than me. (written July 2013)<br /><br />Afternote: If you saw the movie, don't read the book. In this rare<br />case, the book falls short of the movie. The book is told in<br />\\"documentary-style\\" based on memos etc. that recall the events \\"after\\"<br />World War Z. The movie tells it in real-time which is how it should be<br />experienced.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This was a great fast paced Jack Reacher story. He continues to utilize his skills used in the army to survive and help out the United States along the way.
B009MYARIK|1.0|I have enjoyed many of Sophie Kinsella's books but I could barely make it through this book.  It was predictable and annoying to read.
B001ECDVKE|1.0|This particular seller sent me a copy of the movie that does not have any sound other than the music.  No other sound,  no voices.  Who would sell a movie like this . . . It is worthless!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Encouraging, inspiring, and honest!  A must read for young women (and men) aspiring to leadership or even just a successful career as well as leaders of both sexes!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This book was excellent!  I decided to read this after I read Gillian Flynn`s Gone Girl which was also very good.  If you enjoy murder mysteries and psychological twists then this book is perfect for you! Even though the content is somewhat disturbing, it makes this book all the more captivating to read. Read it, you won't be disappointed : )
B000U1ZV8K|5.0|works great delivered on time as well
B008RXYOKY|3.0|The adapter works well.  However, there is no reason it should cost $29.00.  That is just obscene.  Just another way for Apple to stick it to its customers.

B0011UBDTK|1.0|Not sure if y'all knew but you can get this set (probably with even more stuff or extras) cheaper at FYE. This shows $161 and it's $134 brand new at FYE. Just thought it should be known. If I happen to be wrong please let me know so I can remove. :-)
B00CW6DAKC|2.0|Perhaps an ok childs game, but for me? Stupid and boring and dumb. I uninstalled it but right away! I like farm game but this is nothing like it!

B0050DZ8J0|3.0|The user interface design is overly complicated, and it is difficult to sometimes find the exact content you are seeking. Because of this, I am less inclined to use this application on the kindle.

B0094BB4TW|4.0|This application presents the interface that I am  familiar with, and like. There are no hidden surprises and although familiar, I don't have to feel overwhelmed by having to learn a new interface on a new platform.
B00EB6F1TY|5.0|Awesome movie, like the fact that I don't have to return it after I'm done watching it! Highly recommend it.
B00E193TM2|5.0|The Wrong Side of Heaven and The Righteous Side of Hell, is a spectacular album i was glad a made the purchase especially for the price it was for a digital download you cant go wrong! I've always been a fan of 5FDP since I've been in high-school and every time i grab there new album I'm never disappointed. The songs have a good balance between each other there is a balanced mix between both slow paced songs a fast paced song. Every song on this album makes me sing along all the time. Thank god there's going to be the next volume this November because I cant get enough of them and this album.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you love 5FDP and are thinking about getting this album, don't hesitate!

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Loved it!!! It was so poignant and beautifully written. I knew when I bought this book that one of them was going to die but I thought it was going to be Hazel. I was wrong. I could not stop myself from crying when Augustus throws himself his own pre-funeral.

B0026QC0TA|5.0|This movie is heartfelt, full of drama, but yet funny as well. Damon and DeVito make a great team. I could watch it over and over again.
0679890475|5.0|This book has been a favorite for generations in my family.<br /><br />The one star reviews almost all have to do with adoption or mixed race families because the baby bird happens to look like it's mother. All I have to say to that is not EVERY book is for EVERY child. I have no need to read a book to my grandchild about a child with two mommies or whatever. I personally see no need in my family for a book like that, and think it could be very confusing for a young child not in that situation. I won't go all melodramatic like some did and say it's scary and anxiety producing for a child, even though it might be. So...all you folks who hate this book better steer clear of the classic books and movies, like Moby Dick, Jungle Book, Bambi and Lion King.<br /><br />My step daughter loved this story as a child, as did I, and I am buying it today for my granddaughter. Neither of us were ever frightened by it. I am a step mother and obviously don't look exactly like my SD...which never mattered to us, either. We're both human...we're both female...we share the same last name...we both love her Dad. There are plenty of things that families can have in common besides looks. The mother bird going out to get food for the baby is a great message. It's also a teachable moment, because in the animal world, they do have to leave their babies alone sometimes, but human mommies should never do that, and hopefully don't. All in all, it's a children's book, not a parenting how-to...certainly no one mistakes Green Eggs & Ham as a restaurant training manual.

B00DUIBZSK|3.0|I actually like her voice.  This is a good album and most would probably give it a 4 or five.  The downgrade is just for me.  this album is the most recent style with a lot of special effect,  I prefer more of her voice without the effects.  but the songs are fun and you can still listen to all of them.  Just me I guess

B002ZHKZEC|5.0|This is really a short &#34;Season Five&#34; for the David Tennant incarnation of the Doctor, and the end of both Tennant's and Russell Davies run with the show. The writing for these specials, especially &#34;The Waters of Mars,&#34; is a high point for the series, with mature development of character and themes such as the Doctor's interference in the time line. Tennant is more serious in some of these episodes than he has been in seasons 3 and 4, and we see the acting quality that he brings to his non-Doctor Who roles (such as his brilliant turn in the RSC Hamlet production).<br /><br />If you skip this set of specials and move straight from season 4 to season 5, you'll miss a very important story arc that leads to the end of the 10th doctor and the regeneration into the 11th doctor. Don't be deceived by the numbering of the seasons--as I said at the start, this is really season 4.5.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Excellent read! I didn't want it to end ! I would recommend this set to anyone who likes this type of reading.
B001BR3P3U|5.0|Just introduced Blues Brothers to the last grand child (5 years old) and she loves It.  She loved the R&B music most of all.  The inane story, droll dialogue, and music continue to entertain (even when you already have the lines memorized).

B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Purchased this mouse as a replacement for an old Microsoft Intellimouse that finally bit the dust.  Decided to try the Anker brand after reading some good reviews here on Amazon, and I wasn't disappointed.  Lots of buttons, good custmization app (downloadable - as it should be!), and quality build.  I use it for both work and play, and haven't had any issues so far.  I'll be looking for other Anker brand peripherals next time I'm in the market.
B00A0SQBDM|4.0|I am REALLY enjoying this game.  I know - they said it was free,  and there are those who are complaining,  but nothing really good is for free,  right?  This is an exciting game; the graphics are fantastic; and the story is engaging.  G5 - you've done it once again!!!
B0002S947K|5.0|Got exposed to this cat through Pandora... ended up going with this particular CD b/c I really liked the song Trouble.  Solid CD... a lot of the songs have similar sound, but his sound is undeniable and I haven't tired of it yet.
B00AYB1RGG|3.0|A very dark version compared to the first Judge Dredd adaption.  Lots of action, lots of explosions.  Not a deep movie but fun.
B002IVLH60|3.0|Love the song Just Breathe and bought CD hoping it would have some similar tunes.  Had a couple other good songs, but overall not a great... end up skipping through and ultimately listen to about 1/2 the CD each time I listen to it.
0765367297|5.0|Halo: Fall of Reach Review<br /><br /> Are you a fan of sci-fi novels? Do you enjoy the Halo series? Well, if you're ever looking for a book that will actually entertain you, Halo: Fall Of Reach is the one. I have always been a Halo series, but i was never a fan of war or sci-fi novles until I read this book. This book really got me hooked with its great themes of action, its great storyline, and its skillfull writing done by the authour.<br /> I was not expecting much when it came to the descriptions of the action bits in this book. I really had turn around and give props when I read this though. The action is real great, with its great themes of suspense and trial on the battlefeild. It really gave intersting perspectives of a Spartan Soldier in combat, and used good adjectives that really kept you reading through the good parts.<br /> I was really intersted in the storyline and the chronological location of this book. It explores the story of John-117, the greatest soldier who ever lived. Much of the book explores his early experiences as a child, including his abduction and training at just six years of age. The books carries you along as you really go in depth, learing who John really was, verses in other stories in the Halo sereis where nothing is really told about his backround.<br /> The last thing that really impressed me about this bok is great job that the Author Eric Nylund did on writing the book. Honestly, when I picked it up, I really expected it to be a cheesy book about shooting dudes. But it really impressed me on the great story and themes that really kept me reading and allowed me to get lost in the book. Great Job!<br /> Overall, the book really had me impressed and changed my perspective of war and sci-fi novels. I give it a good 5 star rating. I recommend this book to all fans of the Halo universe.

B00CLD65X0|5.0|This program is just amazing. From the clothing , mannerisms, home furnishings, introduction of new electronics and vehicles of the age, to the whole ambiance ,this show has it covered !  We watch the characters develop through the changing times. Lovely! I have about 30 minutes left to watch, and am taking it slowly, for I don't want the Season to end !

B0083Z614S|5.0|I remember as a teenager to have seen during the late 50's a film based on this great book that was really a nice picture, Now , more than 50 years later, I enjoyed again the story reading the book from which the film´s plot was taken, It is a book written for children but I think that most adults will also like it. I highly recommend it.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|if you take it serious it might save your life one day, obviously most of it translates to real emergency situations but here you get a fiction perspective that just helps getting through it

0593065700|5.0|OK, this one was also great but irritated the heck out of me with the spelling of curb.  When he talked about parking next to the curb, it was spelled &#34;kerb&#34; throughout the entire book.  I guess it must be the British spelling and, by the end of the book, I was laughing.
1419702238|5.0|Great book for my 9 year old.  He's a little behind on reading and this material was interesting to him.  Delivery and service was fantastic.  Thanks!
0545586178|3.0|First I just want to point out that this is part of a series.  These are not individual books but part of a trilogy, and so if you have not read `The Hunger Games' then you may not want to read this review as I will be referencing that book and the events within it and so if you don't want spoilers you may want to avert your eyes.<br /><br />Alright, so under immense peer pressure from, not only the teenage kids I know but also their parents, I decided to give `The Hunger Games' a whirl last year.  Besides, I really didn't want to be the ONLY person out of the loop, and I like to (at times) read the books before or at least around the same time that I see the movie.  I was pleasantly surprised with how much I enjoyed `The Hunger Games'.  It wasn't the perfect read (the Young Adult style of writing often irritates me) but it was a breezy and easy and engulfing read (I couldn't put it down).  I found the conclusion a tad sloppy, and yet the buildup was great, the explanation of the games itself was nicely done without being over-the-top and the character development (and that romance between Peeta and Katniss) was nearly perfect.<br /><br />`Catching Fire' picks up a few months after `The Hunger Games' left off, with Katniss and Peeta the surprise victors of the games and their act of rebellion (those berries) serving as a catalyst for the districts themselves to turn on The Capital.  Katniss in particular has started a movement she isn't aware of and cannot stop, but the question arises; does she really want to stop it?  President Snow hates her, in fact he loathes her for what she has done and is determined to DESTROY her and the ones she loves.  Couple that with the approaching Quarter Quell (I'll let Suzanne Collins explain that to you) and the lockdown in the districts by Peacemakers using excessive force to ensure peace and you have high tension within Katniss's life.<br /><br />Not to mention her confused feelings for both Peeta and Gale.<br /><br />I really can't say more.  I mean, that only covers about a quarter of the book, mainly because there is one major plot twist that I don't want to spoil, which also prevents me from explaining any more of the book.  So that leaves me at a little bit of a loss because explaining my personal feelings on the matter and the reasons I feel that this book is a step down from the previous sort of requires that I get into the stuff I don't want to spoil for you.<br /><br />Let's just say this; there is a `games', it isn't what you think and the ending here is almost just as sloppy as the first.  But, worse than that, the book is too repetitive, especially with the constant reminders of Katniss's confused emotional state, and then many parts, especially in the middle of the book, begin to feel like `The Hunger Games' redux.  Then you have the treatment of the games and the cast of characters, which is lazy and uninspired (possibly overworked) and doesn't really ring true with the intentions set out in the first book.  The set up for `Mockingjay' is rather good though, and makes me anxious to get my teeth in that one, but overall this book feels like a sophomore slump to me.<br /><br />I'm sure rabid fans will disagree, but it's how it all felt to me.n't say more.

B005H9B2CE|5.0|For me, I watched the movie the adventures first , so this movie  filled in some character holes about Thor
1401938906|5.0|I loved this book, simple and to the point. I'm re-reading it again...I've read so many books on this subject and this was written in a simple understandable way that newcomers and old comers can grasp.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game, it plays smoothly and is entertaining. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ads keep causing it to force close. This needs to be fixed before I would recommend it to anyone else.
B009RX85N0|5.0|One of my favorite Tv shows love watching all at once.Help me out here, it was totally great and what I wanted.

B00CTSDDVO|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Great plot, great acting and amazing filming!! If you like action, drama, thrillers, or any movies at all, you'll love it. I Recommend this to everyone.

B0044XV3R8|5.0|Being one of the few people on the planet who did not see Avatar in the theaters, I decided to watch it and knew I wanted to have this collectors edition.  The collection comes with three discs, the first two giving extended and added material from the movie broken up in to two segments and the third is how the movie was made.  I really enjoyed it and each time I watch it I see something new.  My only complaint if it is one is that the sound is very low on the DVD set otherwise amazing.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I bought this book on a lark, and am so glad  I did.  they guy who wrote it did a wonderful job creating the characters, and really immersing you into thus world.  thank you Mr Cline for writing such an amazing book.  please write more for this universe!

B009XIXVU6|5.0|This book takes you on journeys, mentally and physically. Highly recommended. The author continues to transplant me. Despite the sorrow, joy emerges.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good book. Good premise, with a couple of interesting twists.  It is worth a look if you like post apocalyptic stories.
B00EEXPDTM|4.0|Amanda does an excellent job.  This couldn't have been an easy role to play, and I think 99% of the actresses in Hollywood couldn't have done it.  This movie is based on the life story of Linda Lovelace, and is a tough and touchy subject.  Certainly worth seeing.
B00DQ8GDV8|5.0|The book is so dense and so well researched that I had to put it aside after each half chapter. I had to adjust my thinking before tackling the next set of evidences. His 33 years of inquiry has been distilled into the unified synthesis that he seeks. It was especially interesting to me as I have familiarity with his Papua New Guinea.
9382951008|5.0|Very few books, nay authors for that matter, are able to engross me in the story and characters in the first 3 chapters, but Khaled Hosseini does it well. Reads less like a memoir (like Kite Runner did). I haven't read anything like the format he's using in this new book (altering between character perspectives as a narrator and then in the form of a letter). So far so good and I'm only on chapter 4. I can't concentrate on anything else at work, I keep thinking about the story. It's soooo good.
0812550706|5.0|Amazing book! Amazing find, I plan on reading this to my kids someday. A story that almost compels you to be like its main character, Ender, as he overcomes every struggle that comes his way. A true work of literary heroic art.

B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this show and can't wait until I can watch the next season.  I wish It could air at the same time as it does in England.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|Very cute game, but can get redundant. The graphics are pretty good. The tilting aspect is new for me, but I find I like it.

B007MAETA8|5.0|This is the kind of music that suits John Mayer.  I might offend his fans from years gone by, but his two latest releases are so much better, years ahead of anything previous.
B00EI6E17A|5.0|want to dance dance dance! this song is another one of Lady Gagas classics hits! Great song! Great beat! Phenomenal!
B0014VPFTA|3.0|There are a few good songs on this CD.  Recommended for the JM fan.  But, I think that the two latest offerings are so much better: Born & Raised, and Paradise Valley.  Skip this one and buy those two.
B009LMTDL0|4.0|I recommend this book for everyone. It offers important insights into perceptions of girls and boys, women and men, and it challenges all of us to be kind, accepting and supportive, and reserve judgements on others.
0061733199|4.0|Great information that everyone should be aware of - wherever you live.  One never knows.  But, took off one star for just a few glaring errors.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I don't know what to say except I do like this game. I have it downloaded on both my phone and my kindle.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|Okay, I am now a John Mayer convert.  With this latest release of some truly great \\"folk\\" music, and his previous release of Born & Raised he has set himself above the mundane music currently available.  I have been listening to this CD nonstop for weeks.  This music is not \\"rock\\", and if you like subdued folk music, I highly recommend this CD.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy doing jigsaw puzzles but to take the time to make space for it to sit out for me to work on when I have time is almost impossible. But with this app I can have it all. I absolutely enjoy it all.  Vibrant colors  spectacular pictures and  I can get more any time. Thanks.
B009LQKHIO|2.0|Megan Kimble lands in Pride, Oregon to attend her older brother's funeral and plans to remain there until she figures out what's next for her. It doesn't take long for her to be embraced by the people of the town and the Jordan siblings, especially Todd, who is immediately drawn to her. Megan is just out of an abusive marriage and is still wearing the  evidence of that brutality.<br /><br />My rating for the book has nothing and everything to do with the story. I'm not usually very picky about grammatical errors and can often overlook minor misspellings and misplaced apostrophes. That isn't the case here as many basic rules of grammar were ignored. It made reading difficult and it's just not excusable to call a work product finished with errors on just about every page. I came close to just abandoning the book but continued on for two reasons.<br /><br />First, in spite of the barriers to getting through the book, it is an interesting story. I liked the characters and wanted to see how their relationships would unfold. This is at least a three-book series and I wasn't willing to give up so easily.<br /><br />Secondly, after reading two chapters, I checked to see if there was an updated version and found one but it wasn't much better. I also looked at the reviews on Amazon to see if anyone else had my same experience and determined I was far from alone. I also noted that the author has since engaged a credible editor for subsequent books and, after reading the sample for the next book, I could see the fruits of that investment. I read at least two chapters and they were nicely presented and completely error free.<br /><br />In summary, rather than give this book one star, I'm giving it another for the quality of the story and the promise of something better in the next books. Megan and Tom have a lovely relationship and his brother and sister are pretty interesting. But, you need to be prepared for a pretty poorly written beginning to a promising series. It's worth the effort and investment to correct all that's wrong with this book.<br /><br />(I was provided an ARC from the author)he effort and investment to correct all that's wrong with this book.<br /><br />(I was provided an ARC from the author)
