B00BAXFAOW|3.0|The first half of the book is very good. However, the last half of the book was more political review, nothing overly insightful, and thus, slower. Not one of my favorite Gladwell efforts.

B005PK56TA|5.0|The story line is top notch.  It keeps me in suspense.  I look forward every week to being entertained by this series.  I am happy that each year is a different story line.  Also Jessica Lange is an extremely talented Actress.  The series is a complete immersion into fantasy.  The story grabs you, and keeps you coming back for more.  You don't want the hour to end
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is great my nephew who is six loves it. it is easy and he doesn't seem to get bored by it which is awesome. plus I enjoy it when I get time.
B006IND5M8|3.0|I was initialy worried that this movie would be as hokey as the title seemed to indicate, but actually the characters and overall production was quite good.  It's basically a western with a genre twist which worked pretty well.  Aside from the title, the plot unfortunate comes up pretty short with poor development, and inexplicable motivation.  Definitely watchable, but don't expect too much from the story.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is a gifted author, this being his best novel. Cathartic, with small hints at life's hidden meanings scattered throughout. Not a pushy writer, but you can walk away from the book taking on some of the subtle beliefs he includes. Would reccomend looking for alaska as well.

B00BD99JMW|1.0|Full disclosure: YA distopian fiction is (not unlike many people these days) my guilty pleasure genre. I love a good crazy government power structure. Divergent certainly delivered on that score, with its factions and choosing ceremonies and kicking people out to live on the streets for no reason other than that they turned 30. Is it high literature? Of course not, but no one wants to read War and Peace all the time. Divergent was fun, had an interesting plot and decent characters, and the writing moved along at a good clip. The romance was teen-y enough to bring me back to my own (admittedly less dangerous) high school days, and I was definitely rooting for Tris and Tobias by the end, eager to read the next book.<br /><br />Insurgent suffered a bit from Middle Book In The Trilogy Syndrome. Tris got pretty whiny, but it was understandable considering what she went through in the first book. When I became annoyed at her, I reminded myself that she was 16 years old, and who among us didn't like a good self-righteous rant at that age? Come on, you know you did. Yes, you. The factionless element was interesting, and bringing in Tobias' mother was a nice look into his life. It definitely dragged more than Divergent, but there were moments that made up for it. It was good enough that when I finished it, I was excited for the last installment.<br /><br />***SPOILERS*** Which brings me to Allegiant. There were so many problems with this book, it was like it wasn't even written by the same person. First of all, I guessed the \\"shocking\\" ending pretty much the first time I came to a Tobias chapter. Why else would she need another narrator besides Tris, if not to do exactly what she did? I didn't have half as much of a problem with the ending as with the fact that the voices sounded exactly alike. Other people have said it, but I will add my own frustration at having to constantly go back to the beginning of the chapter to see who was talking. Next, introducing about five million new characters, plus some other characters that I guess we were supposed to know from previous books but were mentioned so briefly in them that I was left going, \\"Huh?\\" (Amar, anyone?) Maybe Roth thought she had to introduce new people to make up for the ones she killed off. Someone should tell her that there isn't a mandatory number of characters per book. Then, the huge 180 that Evelyn did, basically just because Tobais asked her nicely. Seriously? She spent at least a decade planning for the fall of the factions, and on the eve of what she could only assume would be victory, she gives it all away for the son she'd already abandoned, and proved in previous books that she didn't value above her mission? Okay. Maybe if there had been a -little- bit of hesitation, or characterization, or something that made this make sense, but there was nothing.<br /><br />Last, the ending. As I said, it was completely obvious that this was where this book was headed. It was still terrible, and I don't mean terrible in the sense that I cried because I was so sad that it happened. No, it was terrible because that is a terrible ending. Who is Tris to take away Caleb's decision to do what he considers to be the right thing, just because she thinks that his reasons aren't \\"selfless\\" enough? She comes out the selfish one in this. If she as really selfless, she would have let him make the decision, and lived with the consequences of that for the rest of her life. Oh, and of course, she could resist the death serum. But then, whoops! She got shot anyway. Okay. Honestly, I would have been fine with her dying if she had just died in the crossfire as she ended up doing, and hadn't had to go all \\"hero\\" on everyone, which was really just her martyr complex becoming even more apparent. Her motives are better than everyone else's, we get it. Sigh.<br /><br />All in all, this book was way too long, poorly paced, and repetitive, with characters who were completely different than how they had been portrayed in previous books. Save yourself some time, read Divergent, and make up your own reasons for why the city was the way it was. I guarantee you'll be more satisfied if you do.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|There is not a lot of character development and the dramatic moments sometimes seem muted but, nevertheless, I mostly enjoyed this book. Perhaps the lack of depth in the handling of the story is meant to convey the superficiality of a Circle dominated existence.

B007IXWL2C|5.0|I liked the way this book rounded out their relationship. I thoroughly enjoyed their tit for tat conversations in dealing with married life and all the normality that  we regular folks deal with. The fact that Ana is so from one side of the  tracks ,and question s  him on everything without backing down is refreshing. So many times I see in the public that we take our relationships for granted that no one talks about what pleases them because it's so taboo . Here Ana tries to enter Christians world because she loves him and wants to please him without compromising her own desires. I love that he learns to be a good husband and to protect her ,but backs down when she wants to keep working because that was her desire. All 3 books led to this wonderful end in which it goes to show you things can work out if your willing to work at it. Too many relationships an  marriages fail because people just don't have the patience to see it's worth saving. I'm glad Ana had the balls to stand up to him ,and he had the balls to respect her.<br />I resent that some reviews see these books as so called porn. I see them as a learning text to be more open to what makes you love your mate to experiment to spice things up and to respect and support each other.
B005ETA5K2|1.0|I bought this device because I'm full time in a motorhome and often in a park with WiFi but a very weak signal which my Mac mini couldn't always lock onto. The description says \\"...if you are trying to pick up Wi-Fi from long distances then this is the device to get! The AWUS036NH Receiver sensitivity will allow you to connect from greater distances and get stronger signals to Wi-Fi networks around you.\\" It turns out that it works this way only on a Windows system, but that limitation is not mentioned in the description. You can use it on a Mac to create a LAN, but not to connect a Mac to an existing WiFi network. I exchanged several emails with ALFA before I found this out. It was difficult communicating because they write in broken English that is often impossible to understand, and they obviously hadn't really read what I had written. They would make no offer to exchange it for a device that would work as described on a Mac. $30 down the drain. I don't know if Amazon will refund my money because it's been a year since I bought it, and this week was the first time I actually needed it. Alfa denies any responsibility.
B00FFHG6KQ|4.0|Review on Kindle Fire HD (Previous Generation)<br /><br />I like sports games, but don't actually watch sports on TV, so I have little knowledge of player stats or rosters in the real NBA, which may affect my review. This NBA game by the popular game developer 2K Games is amazing, but will look much better on the Kindle Fire HDX, as it has 323 PPI. The graphics are the best I have seen on a mobile sports game. It does have some great game modes, such as Lebron: Path to Greatness, and a Season mode. I really was hoping for online multiplayer, but unfortunately it only has Bluetooth multiplayer. Overall, it is a really great looking title for a mobile game.<br /><br />Controls<br />The controls were easy to use. It has a d-pad mode or a one finger mode, which I'll explain. The d-pad mode is similar to other games with the d-pad on the left of the screen and pass and shoot buttons on the right. The one finger mode allows you to play the game with just your index finger by tapping characters on your team and using various swipes. It makes the game feel smoother using this mode. The controls were great and I had no trouble.<br /><br />Graphics 10/10 [On Kindle Fire HD (Previous Generation)]<br />The graphics, as I mentioned, are amazing for a mobile game such as this. This will be an astounding game on the new Kindle Fire HDX. I can't say much more other than \\"Wow\\". These graphics make me want to play the game more.<br /><br />Gameplay 10/10<br />One thing you notice first is that there are no commentators at all. I don't know why, because I always hear commentators for sports games. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, as most commentary for mobile sports games is repetitive. I really enjoy playing through the season of any NBA team and having a special Lebron James mode. By the way, in the Lebron James mode, you are only playing as Lebron James and no one else on your team and as far as I know you must defeat teams to make the Miami Heat champions. Although I don't know much about Lebron James, I think this mode is creative and fun. I love the fact that this game has instant replays, too because it makes it realistic. I had a blast playing some match-ups.<br /><br />As for me, this app makes it way to my must-have on Kindle Fire HD list, but drops a star due to a lack of online play. It still is some of the most fun you'll have in the app store because of the realism and gameplay, especially for NBA fans. I love this game and can spend about half an hour playing at a time.<br /><br />Friend me on Amazon Gamecircle to see scores and stats on great games: Miles917much about Lebron James, I think this mode is creative and fun.

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I read this on the recommendation of a friend who is an avid reader of literary fiction and also young adult fiction.  This book was not what I was expecting - it has more fantasy elements in it than I expected.  This is fine, though, and I found those elements woven nicely into a plot about a man coming to terms with a series of episodes from his childhood.  I think ultimately this book is about loss, and about how to live with a childhood trauma that never really goes away even through adulthood.  I like the narrator of the story, I'm sympathetic to him and I root for him throughout.  I wonder, too, if the whole story isn't a metaphor for how children experience the world of adults as a world in which they (as children) participate and have to deal with, but inside which they have very little control and feel at the mercy of forces far bigger and more ominous than them.  Anyway . . . . it's not that long, it's engaging, and I'm glad I read it.

B000002J2F|5.0|This is a top 25 rock album for me and clearly Genesis' best. Phil Collins was never better and the instrumentals never more focused, elaborate and creative. Their later albums like Abacab and Invisible Touch had tracks that got more radio play, but were not better albums, with a lot of silly material that hasn't aged as well today. No so here. Just listen to tracks Behind the Lines, Misunderstanding, Turn It On Again, Dukes Travels/End. All of these tracks are on a level considerably higher than any other albums from the band. The rest of the album is solid as well. Duke sounds better with each listen and, taken as a whole, is one of the greatest rock albums of all-time. It still sounds amazing, even today.<br /><br />** Note - For the small portion of Genesis fans out there who think their early stuff was the best and the departure of Gabriel brought the band down, I will just say this: Phil Collins wrote/co-wrote every song on Duke, sings all of them, and plays the drums on all tracks. If that isn't talent I don't know what is. He's amazing. No, they didn't miss that oddball Peter Gabriel at all here. 5 Stars. Highly Recommended.

B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|The Room reminds me a lot of the Myst games, which I really enjoyed.  I actually like The Room even more.  With the Myst games I used to get stuck to the point where I had to keep detailed notes and look up walk-throughs to figure out how to get past.  The Room, while challenging, isn't so challenging that you get stuck indefinitely.  When you really get stuck, the hints help you along and keep you from getting to the point of frustration.  They made good use of the tablet interface, although it sometimes takes me multiple attempts to zoom out.  It would be better if they used a double tap rather than or in addition to a pinch to zoom out.  I also liked the use of tilting the tablet on some of the puzzles and hope they make more use of it in future games.

B00EQF2EIG|3.0|I love Joss Whedon. I love Nathan Fillion. Both appeared out of place with this flick -- as though they bought into the hype and just went with it. The black-and-white was annoying; the actors ranged from buying into the material hard-core to simply reciting the words... not much about this version struck a chord with me.<br /><br />I fully recommend the Branagh version of this classic. Hate to say it, but I wouldn't waste your time on this version.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I hated the thought that wheat could be the cause of my irritable bowel syndrome, but it was the cause, beyond a shadow of doubt. I eliminated wheat, and only wheat. All my symptoms disappeared within a week, maybe less! I've had this condition more years than I wish to mention. I don't know about others, but for me, this book has changed my life with respect to my health. I have learned one other thing: There is more to eat than wheat, so, if you must admit that wheat is hurting your body, do not despair. There are other good things to eat. Really. I know it seems impossible to believe, but, there are tasty and satisfying foods that do not contain wheat. Yes, you will miss pizza and pasta, as I do, but get over it! Live and be healthy! Incidentally, I've been off wheat for about five weeks. Not a long time. Long enough to know for sure.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I pre-ordered Allegiant and was thrilled to see it pop up in my kindle cloud.  At first it was slow reading - I even put it down for a couple of days because I couldn't bring myself to get back to what seemed to be a mediocre and dragging story line.  But then - NO SPOILERS - WHOA. I was taken on a thrill ride that made me laugh, cry, want to hug someone, cry some more, and be astonished. Whatever your preconceived notion of this book is, toss it out of the window.

B00CL8D83U|3.0|I see a lot of people are making rave reviews about this album, saying it is a true return to form for the boys. A return to their magic formula of their so called \\"imperial phase\\" : the tracks they made between 1985 and 1989 but there, I really disagree.<br /><br />YES, Electric is a pretty good album and a very electronic one which is a pleasant change, especially when you compare this album to their previous one Elysium. But saying that this is a true return to form is a lie.<br /><br />Granted the track Thursday (their next single which will be released November 4th) can remind us a lot of their first hit West end girls (a moody music with Neil speaking voice on it) and I know a lot of Americans love Neil Tennant's speaking voice but the rest of the album is not on par with their first three albums.<br /><br />I'm not saying the other tracks in here are not good either but quality wise, it is just not the same, so don't let yourself be fooled by these reviews. If you like what the PSB have produced between 1985 and 1989, you will not automatically like all of this album. But there are a handful of honestly good tracks here.<br /><br />For instance, Axis is an excellent high-energy instrumental (one of the best they have ever done in fact : it's too bad the other tracks on this album don't have that kind of insane energy. When I first heard this track, I immediately bought this album thinking all of the tracks will be like this one, unfortunately, no other track here is like Axis.<br /><br />The rest of this album is like a mix of everything (good or bad) the Pet Shop Boys are able to do when it comes to dance music.<br /><br />Love is a bourgeois construct seems to mix classical music with disco beats just like Left to my own devices did in 1989 and the cover of Bruce Springsteen's song The last to die could be an honest single as well but the rest of the album is much more disapointing, at least to me (an early fan).<br /><br />The track Bolshy started out nicely. It was really refreshing to hear nice sounds and a very nice melody (which reminds me of Domino Dancing a little : their 1988 hit) but when the chorus comes, it ruins it all sadly. I think this music deserved a much better chorus than that lame and painful Boshy, bolshy, bolshy-o routine, it's a shame.<br /><br />The tracks Fluorescent and Inside a dream are ok tracks I guess but I've heard better Pet Shop Boys b-sides back in the day. Vocal is a little bit better, but it is a little too repetitive for my taste. Too bad it was a physical single release especially knowing that Axis wasn't because they really are not in the same league, not at all.<br /><br />And finally Shouting in the evening is the worst Pet Shop Boys track I've heard in a long time (it reminds me of that awful Left to my own devices b-side called The sound of the atom splitting : really awful). Just like Bolshy, it started out nicely as well but went down the toilet pretty fast this time. How dare they put this track on an album !<br /><br />I am not a bitter old fan that says that everything new they make is lame, I love a lot of things here and there on this album and even on their last three or four previous albums but it's just that hearing everyone saying (or writing that) Electric is as good as their first albums is just wrong.<br /><br />Some people say that having only 9 tracks is the problem here but I don't think it is. Actually, I was really pleasantly surprised to see them release a brand new album less than a year after Elysium (it's almost a first for them since the 90's) and especially after hearing Axis, I was really looking forward to listen to this album but even though it has three or four very good songs (the singles mostly), it doesn't necessarely make it a truly memorable album. Besides the album Introspective only had 6 tracks but it was a great album and almost a masterpiece nevertheless.<br /><br />So you can say that Electric is a decent album, even a good one if youcompare it to Elysium but please, be a little honest, and don't say it is as good as their first three album because really, it is not.<br /><br />This album is good alright, but still, even when you compare it to more recent \\"up\\" albums of the Pet Shop Boys, it is not as good as Very or even Yes.

B00DMEQP46|5.0|If you only like MGMT for their early pop singles 'Time to Pretend', 'Kids', and 'Electric Feel', then OF COURSE you aren't going to enjoy this album. MGMT are just as gloriously as all-over-the-place as always, but with even better production this time around. I really loved the visualizer thing they did with this album pre-release, but hearing it on CD quality is a real treat. One of my favorite bands right now. Can't wait to see how they subvert expectations even MORE in the future.
B00821OX98|4.0|Better than I had hoped. Glad we had a chance to try it out. The story line keeps you driven.
B00BG4RLF6|5.0|This album didn't blow my mind the first time I heard it, but the more I listened to it, the more it grew on me. He is so talented in so many different, subtle areas of music-making. If you are into hiking at all, try listening to this album on a stroll through a forest, or any kind of nature (especially on a foggy day). I guarantee it you will enjoy it.
B00009AHSO|4.0|If you remember listening to Men at Work back in the day and would like to catch all their hits on one album this compilation will do it. If you are a stronger fan with even one of their albums (especially Business As Usual) then it's a harder call. This compilation is not layed out equally among Men At Work's three albums so your mileage may vary depending on what you like best.<br /><br />Here is the breakdown:<br /><br />Business as Usual represents nine songs on this compilation, and the original album only had ten tracks. You are essentially getting the entire first album with the exception of Helpless Automation. What sucks for me is I really like that song! If they made room that one song I could get rid of my album. If you have Business As Usual  please be advised you are pretty much getting the album all over again.<br /><br />Cargo has six tracks on this greatest hits album which is more than half the original record. I think this compilation hits the mark on the most notable songs from that album so not as many worries on my end. If you have Cargo... well you're getting the better half of Cargo again.<br /><br />Two Hearts has four tracks and this is the album I know least about. I am assuming that goes for most fans out there as it was released after their popularity waned. I couldn't tell you if these are the best from that album or not but to me these tracks don't hold the same magic as their hits from the previous albums.<br /><br />So in conclusion if you have no albums from Men At Work then this is a great grab, although I cry for you for not getting Helpless Automation. If you have one of the first two albums it's a tough call... easier for you if you have Cargo as you get all of the first album and a bit of the third. Probably the best compromise other than if you have Two Hearts only, which gets you the most bang for the buck. If you ask me if you already have one of the first two albums just get the other. Personally I don't see enough on the third album's representation to factor it in.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|The game is very good. I enjoy the game very much. I think it's the best game I've ever played. I have no negative comments as what I see. The game gets challenging after a while but that's fine by me.
B00G32OER4|4.0|The haunted house/demon haunting genre is a bit overplayed but this movies was done well.  The cooperation between the two families was refreshing.

B00785P2QC|4.0|Virtual city playground is so cool. My little brothers play it every day before they go to school.  I play it too.  My cousin down loaded it too and we give each other hints on how to make our cities better
B0000CABK8|5.0|All the movies were in great shape.  Brings back good times to see then all again.  Will share with my kids later on.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Loved it. A must read. Right up there with the Shining. The Stephen King I love to read. Was well worth the wait.

B00A8ECU24|5.0|Wow I do say I just got it to make my sister made for coping her but I will though that out the window this is a great app for my little pony lovers any age.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I've enjoyed this series intensely! Intense is the right word since there are so many emotions tied to these characters. This particular book made my heart ache.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This is a great book and a great read. You will gain not only a new look at who Jesus of Nazarath might have been, but a detailed understanding of the times that he lived in, what his followers may have experienced, and how it all fits in a context for us today.
B004XZR63M|5.0|This book is the first that I have read that so perfectly illustrates the mindsets of the rich versus those of the middle class.  It offers excellent practical advice to efficiently use money and &#34;make money work for you&#34;.  I am working on building my mental assets in order to start a portfolio of monetary assets right now.  Highly recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This is a fun and maddening game. There is too many steps (for me) before getting to game. That is why I gave it 4 out of 5 stars. Works great on KINDLE FIRE.
B0089EHWQE|3.0|I think the writer took a controversial subject and tried to write a love story about it. I can't say it was awesome, it was middle of the road. It isn't a book I'd read again and it wouldn't be a book I'd recommend.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love Candy Crush Saga. Was very excited to see it available for the Kindle Fire!  Hour of endless fun right in my hands.
1446249182|5.0|Andy Field makes what could be a tedious and difficult to understand topic enjoyable to read about.  He also found a way to make the book as applicable to the undergrad stats student as it is for the seasoned researcher.  If that weren't enough, there's an incredible online resource that doubles the amount of material you get for the purchase price.  Highly recommend it to anyone interested in learning how to apply SPSS to a stats task or even to learn more about the appropriate uses of statistics in evaluating information.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|nice variety of imagination and movie intonations. very engaging and keeps your interest with no dead ends to have to return later for more play.

B004H4XDBI|5.0|I really enjoyed these books they were such a great break from the same story that are in all the other books.  Such a unique way of telling a story.  I loved his point of view.  I would reccommend you all to read this.
B000VIK8D0|5.0|Just coming back from visiting Tombstone, AZ.  This film gives a little more light into his life and appears to have some interesting detail.  I enjoyed it for the first time especially after my Tombstone visit.  I do like Tombstone with Russell/Kilmer combo, but this gives a little more information behind the story.  Looking forward to watching it again soon.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|What a refreshing take on a book.  Great story about the choices we make and how they affect us.  I loved the style of writing the author uses.  You learn alot about the characters in th book.  Grab your kleenexes cause this is a tear jerker.
B0094K1K8I|3.0|This is an ok movie. It's much like the others. Nothing sets this movie a part from 1&2. Can't speak on 4 as I have not seen it.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I love entering the world that Veronica Roth has created with the Divergent series.  This book will keep your attention till the last page. Shocking ending that I thought was so brave on part of the author.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|So disappointed in the last book of the series.  I invested time in getting to know the characters and the story.  After 3 books, my heart was ripped out...and for what, because Tris just had to die according to the author.  Books are fantasy, why couldn't Tris have a 'happy ever after' with Four?  I understand I am not the author, it is not my story to tell.  I will not buy any future books by Ms Roth.  I don't want to take a chance on being disappointed again.  I was really looking forward to the movie - I see no point now.  I feel as if she ruined the future movie(s) for everyone.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|relatively inexpensive and a perfect mix for listening to audio, watching video on PC, even mixing music on Garage Band
B000001DYJ|5.0|Got it for a friends birthday and she said it was great, i could hear her smile through the receiver
B001DJLCPE|4.0|This review is for the Blu-ray transfer only and not the film itself.  The Blu-ray version of Dr. Strangelove is an improvement upon the DVD version.  Scratches, noise and other artifacts have been removed.  The level of detail, while not totally crisp, is nevertheless good for a movie of this age.  Some scenes have noticeable film grain, considerable in a few scenes, but of the soft variety, not gritty.  The sound was strong and clear of hisses, pops and the like.  Gunshots have some oomph to them.  If you are considering an upgrade from DVD, I think it is worth it.  Recommended.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game, everyone was talking about this game<br />And finally it's here. I am having a ball playing it. It's very challenging and addicting.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Just a great racing game. Lots of upgrades and keeps you involved. Fun to race others. Have not ran into any issues except in game purchasing of cars and items.
B00C2VIA52|5.0|This game is awesome I am asiomo from the awesome demotion were we are from an  we created this game with our awesome minds .......your welcome
006202406X|1.0|I will not critique the ending, though do not get me started on that. The true flaw of this book is the terrible decision to have dual voices. Was Roth trying to shock us? Was she out of ideas? Horrible decision. Roth cannot make any distinction between narrators and I frequently had to remind myself whose perspective I was reading. Moreover, the plot never truly comes together with any logic. Like Suzanne Collins before her, Roth falls victim to a terrible last book in a trilogy. I suspect she tried to write it and get it off to the publisher too quickly and with too much of a wish to \\"have a bang.\\" Lesson learned: authors, please don't write a third book for the sake of writing a third book. Wait until your plot makes sense. Better yet? Make sure you have a quality ending before you write book one and two. Also, probably best to keep all books in a trilogy written in the same voice.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Best game I've played in a long time great way to pass the time when work is slow even got my bossess playing it

B00ACP3OOM|5.0|Before i bought this I searched a lot on the internet about every waterproof mp3 player available on the market.<br />Generally this one was elected the best.<br />So I decided to buy it too. And I am very pleased with it. Sound quality really impressed me. It gets very loud if you want too.<br />4gB it's enough to have fun while you swim.<br />But, to be honest, it took me some attempts to get the best way of clipping it to my swimming gogles.<br />It just kept falling of it. But after some trials, I got the hang of it.<br />Once it´s correct clipped, you'll problably forget that it's there.
B00BG08FKK|5.0|Can you tell that I love it?  I originally heard a little bit of the music on the radio and said to myself that I have to get the soundtrack.  I have yet to see the movie but hope to soon.  After ordering the soundtrack from you I then found out that I could also put it on my phone and my computer.  I am now set to hear this wonderful music both in my car with the disks,on my phone and on my computer.  I am looking forward to ordering more music from you.
B00A0ABQLM|3.0|Bought one for my Surface Pro - works great.<br /><br />Bought another one for my Surface Pro 2.<br />The SP2 was having problems staying connected to the Internet.<br />Finally tracked in down to the adapter - it would work fine then 'die'.<br /><br />Going to try a different brand.<br /><br />Update:  I would like to thank Anker for great customer service regarding this problem.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game is challenging and entertaining.  The graphics are beautiful.  My only complaint is how long it takes to earn crystals and then how few you get.  I am on a fixed income and I have learner from previous games hoe easy these games can suck up your money.  I have to be very careful about not buying anything at the store.  Otherwise, I really enjoy the game.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|I purchased this for my son who is studying World War 1 and World War 2 this semester.  Though, many of the clips are in Black and White, these are very informative.
B00F88U4J6|5.0|This is my main epub reader, I like highlighting words, using the dictionary for clarifying words, ease of use. importing books and magazine from different sources<br /><br />I tried several of the top readers, this is the best for versitility
B0019I6WDG|2.0|I didn't love this movie.  The characters and the storyline were somewhat unbelievable.  I wouldn't watch this movie again or recommend it to anyone else.
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|Great movie. If your a Star Trek fan, buy this movie. The special effects are amazing and its action packed.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|EVEN OLD PEOPLE WILL ENJOY USING THE PROGRAM DUOLINGO. THE PROGRAM. IS FUN AND EASY TO OPERATE. I LOVE THE MANY DIFFERENT WAYS THE PROGRAM ENCORPORATES TO REALLY GET YOU INVOLVED. I AM HOOKED ON THIS PROGRAM. I SPEND HOURS ON IT. IT KEEPS MY MIND ENGAGED AND IS SO MUCH FUN. I ALSO LIKE BEING ABLE TO GO BACK THE NEXT DAY AND START AT THE BEGINNING IF I NEED THE REVUE. IT ALSO MAKES YOU LEARN TO SPELL IN BOTH ENGLISH AND THE OTHER LANGUAGE YOU ARE WORKING IN. I LAUGH AT MYSELF SOMETIMES WHEN I AM SUPPOSED TO TRANSLATE TO THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE I CATCH MYSELF WRITING HALF IN THE FOREIGN LANGUAGE AND HALF IN ENGLISH. IT JUST GOES TO SHOW YOU YOU THINK IN THE LANGUAGE YOU GREW UP WITH. SHOWS I MUST BE CAREFUL TO PUT ALL THE WORDS IN THE SENTENCE IN THE RIGHT LANGUAGE. IT REALLY IS A GREAT PROGRAM.I have had the program for about two weeks and have learned more Spanish than I had learned in the past 72 years living in the southwest about 100 miles from the border between Mexico and the U.S.A. It will be nine to surprise my Spanish speaking friends when I can converse with them in their language. They have had to learn my language now I will learn theirs. THANK YOU FOR SUCH AN EASY WAY TO LEARN.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Megan wasn't going the relationship route anymore. She was going with sperm donation. No more problems, no hassles, and no more bad relationships. She and her girlfriends were out drinking. Megan wasn't feeling any pain.<br />  Conner was at the same bar. He and his buddies were getting trashed.

Megan does go up to him explaining about her girlfriends and asking him to just walk out of the bar with her so she won't be harassed by them all night.<br />  She wakes up in the morning talking to the tidy bowl man, hungover, and very married. Uh Oh!! She doesn't even remember the ceremony.<br />  Conner wants her because he fell in love with her last night while he was getting to know her. He makes her an offer. Instead of getting an annulment...how about giving the marriage a chance for 3 months. Every time they kiss each other, Megan's mind blanks out. She does agree, but only if there is no sex for those 3 months.<br />  This book is hilarious in the way this situation is handled. I enjoyed it from beginning to end. I hope you do too.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|While Hollywood tries, BBC know how to produce the best Jane Austen movies. You won't be disappointed in this delightful version of Emma!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This book was a disappointment to me compared to the first two. I didn't like how it jumped back and forth between who was telling the story. I kept getting confused. Of course the ending sucked - no one will want to see that movie! For some reason I pictured Tris as a brunette - not a blonde!
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|This movie was very original.  I imagine it would have been great in theatres.  The effects were different and the story kept you going..
B00BEIYMAG|4.0|Why do people write these terribly-long-reviews?? Like they're Professional-Critics, Or writing their College-Thesis on the flick? Geezus! Anyways, here's my review on The Conjuring; Its a Good Movie! Not the scariest movie I've seen,  but still-Scary! Without alot of C.G., Blood & Guts, Swearing, & all the other things ya see in 90-percent of today's horror movies. Go ahead and get it if you haven't seen it You won't be sorry! It's definitely one for the collection! :-) Peace, Thomas (Tommy) M.
B002WY65W4|5.0|This movie has funny, scary, and drama all in one.  Along with great casting and effects.  Really love Woody's character!
B0089LOG02|3.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I could feel for the children, and the unfeeling nature of the adults involved.  I had trouble understanding people could be so cruel.
B00DWZHTRW|5.0|The title threw us off but the movie was great.  Kept you wanting more at the end.  Exciting effects and great storyline that keeps you guessing.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it, but it's so addictive!!! So many adults play this. So it's not just for kids!! It's awesome and addictive!!
B00C2PO09I|5.0|This was the most creative movie thus far that did not get great publicity.  The actors really pulled you in and the graphics made you believe it all!
B0014BY72Q|4.0|Science fiction used to have more leeway, back in the 1970s when this one was made.<br /><br />Most modern science fiction has to include some kind of alien race that's trying to kill us these days.<br /><br />But to me, the best science fiction explores different aspects of human nature as this one does, other examples include Blade Runner, etc.<br /><br />No spoilers here but, I would like to say that, despite the Hollywood ending the story claims no &#34;answers&#34;<br /><br />I highly recommend it if you have an afternoon or evening to kill, it's fun, enjoy.
B0000AK7AA|4.0|Wish it was on bluray.  Love Christina Ricci (sp?)  This is a great movie for kids also.. Even though it is not in their era...

B00G6Q29KQ|5.0|I have been eagerly awaiting this book since falling in love with Outview and Outin. I am happy to report that Outmove, book three in this exciting trilogy, does not disappoint! Book 3 starts off fast and the relentless pace continues until the unexpected climax.  Hero Nate  becomes the leader of the revolutionary movement against the dark forces of Omnia and this makes for an exciting plot. I was blown away by many of the plot twists and reversals. If you haven't read this trilogy, you are in for a treat.
1405911662|2.0|Did not keep me engaged; it did not live up to the hype and I feel that I wasted my money.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|I loved the first book and this one is good too. The back & forth point of views was not my favorite & it confused me in the beginning but it worked very well for what this book needed to accomplish. I want to start reading the next one right away. I would recommend this to anyone that like  the dystopian genre... similar to Hunger Games & The Giver series.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have been waiting awhile for this Thank You!!!!!  I just love this game!!!!!!! I haven't had not one glitches or problems and I play it like crazy.
B00DHHWY9I|4.0|Director Baz Luhrmann is creative and this film looks amazing on Blu Ray. But, it also looks fake. But that's the way he films. It's dazzling as an art piece, but a bit boring at times. Music is crazy because it tries to blend modern (Hip Hop) with the old jazz from the 20's, which doesn't really work. I find his films fun to watch because of the incredible attention to detail and color and the film is visually spectacular. But, the story gets a little lost in the glitz and glamour.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I LOVE THE GAME I PLAY THE GAME almost every day PLEASE thank you for putting it on kindle fire hd for free.PLEASE PUT MORE FREE GAMES  I love games to play when I out of town.

0525478817|5.0|The feeling this book leaves is a hope in your heart that there are bigger things in this world than electronics, the newest clothes, and frivolous things. Love is what really has Hazel pushing through, especially when she meets Augustus. Augustus' actions towards Hazel are indescribable. Going through the same things she is going through, is a bond not many can have together.  On their trip to Amsterdam, even though Hazel did not meet her favorite author, Peter Van Houten, I believe she found more about herself and her true heart than ever before. The compassion they share for each other is amazing especially when Augustus' cancer came back, she never left him. Also, at his funeral, she completely rewrote her eulogy to him to tend to the broken heart of his suffering parents. This book reaches beyond your outer core and finds something everyone can relate to through these two characters in the book especially. I know I found many things in common about myself and Hazel while reading this book. This experience has taught me that even though someone is different or has a different life, does not mean they are bad. Just because they might not understand what you are going through, does not mean they are not going through anything as well. I recommend this book for anyone who needs to find a deeper meaning in their life, or even themselves.

1401917232|5.0|This third book in Gary Renard's trilogy, \\"Love Has Forgotten No One\\" is well worth the wait.  Gary takes us deeper into a spirituality that shows we are perfect: unlimited, unbounded, eternal, innocent, immortal, and complete.  We are created by a power so vast and wise that we can't imagine it:  God - by whatever name you choose.  And we are a part of this Light/Energy/Spirit.  He also shares more secrets with his readers, some of them rather shocking.  As people obtain and read this wonderful book, the Universal Mind, or Collective Intelligence cannot help but be raised.  This book contains hope and optimism for the future.  It is very personal and uplifting.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|a very nice game fun till you run out of lives and too much of a hassle to beg for more.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I thank you should get it. If you dont your missing out on alot of fun .you can play ot any where you want .
B0089LOG02|4.0|I was quite caught up in the Orphan Train stories.  I can't imagine what all of those children went through.  The book was very informative about the plight of these kids.
B00BUKZ4O6|5.0|My family has been so invested in Disney/Pixar films that other productions have been somewhat ignored.  We also don't go see many films in the theater as our kids would rather watch movies at home. However, this summer we chose to go see Despicable Me 2 - having never seen the original movie.  It was awesome and obviously resulted in the later purchase of this Combo pack.<br /><br />What a great movie!  It's funny, intelligent, creative, and very entertaining.  The music flows well with the writing and characters.  Our kids think that the minions are hilarious.  We've watched it many times since buying the movie and can't wait to buy Despicable Me 2 when it comes out.  Highly recommended for families!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|i thought the plot was intriguing, and i liked the actors. The ending was a surprise, and took me off guard.
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I like gadgets that track my activities, running mileage, etc.  I have a [[ASIN:B003J2V8AC Garmin Forerunner 110 GPS-Enabled Sport Watch with Heart Rate Monitor (Pink)]] that I wear when I'm running or hiking.  Because it is linked to GPS, though, it doesn't work for most of my daily activities (primarily the walking I do at my job, indoors).<br /><br />I liked the idea of this activity tracker, including the sleep monitoring feature.  Unfortunately, this little device doesn't deliver on most of what it offers.<br /><br />It is truly a small, unobtrusive unit.  Easy to slip into a pocket.  Battery life is pretty decent.<br /><br />The problems are with the reliability and dependability of the data.  I can move all day (walking around factory floor, easily walking a couple of miles, and have just a fraction of a mile recorded).  Or I can take a flight of stairs, and record 100 feet of elevation change.  The sleep monitoring only recorded me as awake if I actually got out of bed, but didn't care if I laid there all night awake.<br /><br />I think there is a lot of demand for a product such as this, so I'm hoping they'll eventually upgrade the device.  I'd be happy to have a truly functional activity tracker.
B005LJJESY|3.0|We will watch this movie on the Kindle ASUS when we visit the kids for a Halloween treat at evening time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a highly addictive and fun game! Don't start playing this unless you're in it for the long haul because once you start, you won't be able to stop!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|It is ok; my daughter shared it with me and I will play it occasionally. Very much like bejeweled which I enjoyed and that I learned to play a few years ago.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Stephen King has done it again--written another book that you just can't wait for the next thing that might happen when you turn the page. I wasn't sure I would like it. I'm more into truth and reality and I'm definitely not a zombie fan at all. But I am a die-hard Stephen King fan so I pre-ordered the book for my Kindle and waited impatiently for its release.<br /><br />Some of my friends used that waiting time to re-read \\"The Shining,\\" thinking\\" Doctor Sleep\\" was a sequel to it. I didn't and didn't ever feel like something was happening that I would've understood better had I brushed up on \\"The Shining.\\"<br /><br />The story moves right along, never getting bogged down with too many plots. One of the reasons King<br />is my favorite novelist of all time is that he writes like he is sitting across from the reader, talking in normal, everyday language as he spins a story that you find yourself a character in. You don't have to be a lover of King' s books or even a fan of paranormal stories to enjoy this book. After all, the characters are just normal, everyday people like you and me.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|You will wish there was more... There should have been. The universe is well crafted, take the wild west, far future, and set them just after a civil war. Characters that are so diverse you'll wonder how they can stand each other. Throw in a mystery that arcs throughout the series and Joss's mastery of craft. Firefly. You will wish there was more... There should have been.
1451678193|5.0|The Story of this book is fragmented between different times and is very interesting. The Martians in the story seem inconsistent and makes for an interesting tale.

B0088EDMMS|5.0|We watched this the day it arrived. Love this movie! Hilarious! I love all three of these actress, how could you go wrong with them?
B002LHRM2E|4.0|TOC view on project management. A very mind provoking view on how to handle estimation and buffers in a project. Read it!

B009RH973I|3.0|Had no idea I purchased a new generation kindle fire hd 7. (Not identified as 2nd generation) So the 1st generation did not fit. I like the product I have it for other devices.  I think this is kindle's fault for not stating what generation the product was.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|My daughter arrived in this area a couple of days after this had happen. It affected her greatly. I was half joking about the tips. We do keep a bag of emergency essentials with us , in our house and in our car. Yes,even when we went on vacation to the beach this year! As luck would have it, my daughter moved to Joplin, MO shortly after the tornado. The devastation was overwhelming there too. She keeps a grab and go bag in the tornado proof room of her house. You never know when or how disaster will strike.  The movie was great. The story line will pull at your heartstrings and was well done, the filming was amazing.  My family enjoyed it.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|The Lorax is such a good story/movie.  And finally something without princesses.  It is funny and has a current/modern message.  The animation is adorable and the music is awesome.  The whole family gets up and dances.  We gave it to several families for Christmas and they love it as well.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|It's just as well this thing is relatively cheap - it really isn't all that functional while Google falls all over itself trying to appease 'big content' providers so that they'll allow their media libraries to be streamed to it...  Do you really need another middle-man between you and those re-runs of \\"Married with Children\\" that you're so interested in watching on Netflix?<br /><br />In the meantime:<br />Can you use it to 'cast' pictures on your phone  to your TV?  Nope...<br />Can you use it to cast that cute video of baby's first steps that's on your phone to your TV?  Nope...<br />And that great album you just bought on Amazon MP3 and spent all day bopping to at work, can you cast that through the home theater sound system attached to your TV?  Nopety nope nope...<br /><br />I gave it two stars because the YouTube integration is fairly smooth and the screensaver pictures are cute, just don't expect to use any of your own pictures in that slideshow...
B0060MYM3S|5.0|A wonderful movie that will give me many fine hours of entertainment.  It has an exciting plot that keeps one on the end of the chair.
B0018RC7QE|4.0|This is a great chick flick.  I would definitely recommend this if you want to see a good old fashioned love story.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|It is exciting, well done with a good plot.  Sometimes it becomes a little hard to follow but pretty soon things start coming together.  I would recommend it for serious viewers.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|Great show.  It has intelligent writing and thought provoking plots. Love the starsand how they carry over the suspense from one show to the next.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing this game and my goal is to get all three stars one every level its a challenge
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I have been waiting what feels like forever for this book.  I read a lot of series and usually never bother to retread the first books, but instead just start with the new installment. However I was so excited for Allegiant I actually spent the last three nights rereading the series after my young and early rising children went to bed.<br /><br />I want my wasted time and lost sleep back. Not to mention that I just spent the last few hours of my only day off this week reading this horrible book. I would have felt more satisfied if I had tacked the laundry pile I ignored to indulge in a long awaited book.<br /><br />I did not bother to read the reviews, as the first two books were great and the characters seemed to be solid. I wish I had. I still would have read it since I need closure, but I would have done it leisurely. It felt like a separate story all together.  The genetics thing did not really solve any problems or add to the story, it was a plot that felt rushed and not thought through. Both Tris and Tobias annoyed me the entire book. I thought we got past all the whining/ not being together stuff in Insurgent, but like a broken record it just keeps going.  The ending left me depressed. And the most depressing thing is that the &#34;BIG EVENT&#34; didn't affect me like it should. I should be wiping tears from my eyes right now and yet nothing. It's almost like the book caused me to uninvest in the characters I had grown to love.<br /><br />My recommendation is read it if you have to. If you  can handle not having closure, then stop with the first two before allthe characters you love are unrecognizable. And for heavens sake, DON'T bother wasting your day off like I did!
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|This book tells the life story of one fascinating woman in a style resembling earlier writers, which is incredibly well done. It held my attention straight through so that I started it on a Saturday and finished it by Monday.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Best series in a long time..can't wait for the next season...might have to move to England to see the #4 if Jan. doesn't get her e soon enough

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|game is fun to play.do not like that u have to be involved with face book to get extra lives. I am not a fan of face book.
B0092S4WLY|3.0|This game was really had to figure out as there were no instructions and you had to figure everything out yourself. I did enjoy it once I figured it out.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Good story, interesting plot twists, but the epilogue absolutely fascinated me, made the book a new favorite and one I often recommend to others.
1856697061|5.0|This book is great picture and instructions are very easy to follow would be great for anyone trying to add dimension into there designs.
B000002L3P|5.0|I was very happy to discover Kenny Wayne Shepherd's music. Guided by the numerous 5 star reviews on amazon, I took a chance on this CD and very happy with my purchase.
B00BMCAM6M|4.0|this is a very  good app and it fill the needs i need it to fill  all the  music i want to hear  i find  there are a few probs i have with it such as loading time but thats it
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Kaled Hosseini is a gifted writer.  I was drawn into this story immediately and couldn't wait until I could get back to it each day.  The story reveals the impact of a one decision on the lives of several individuals and how they interconnect.  Once again, I gained more insight into the story of Afghanistan.
B00CUKTG2Q|5.0|I didnt even hear any of the singles for this album, but the whole album is good pick it up if your into them you wont regret it
006202406X|2.0|I am a librarian.  So you could say I am a professional reader.  I have read Divergent and Insurgent.  I have received my copy of Allegiant.  Haven't read it yet.  But I have read the reviews-even the spoilers.  While I read all of the negative points of this book that are being made by the readers I keep thinking one thing.  If these are all true then Veronica Roth got very poor advice from her agents and editors.  I applaud any writer who tries different writing styles.  But her agent should have told her you don't change a writing style (different POVs) in the middle of a trilogy.  Fans are looking for cohesive continuation of the story they fell in love with. They don't want to familiarize themselves with a different structure.  Try the different writing style somewhere else.  The attempt to veer from the formulaic plot of present day dystopian fiction is also commendable.  How many trilogies (plus) have we seen book 1: fall in love with boy A.  Book two: triangle between protagonist and boy A and boy B.  Book three: protagonist returns to boy A.  I read so much I LOVE it when someone forgets the formula and writes something different.  Please-surprise me! The holes in the plot?  Where were her editors?  I am sure they are all getting a huge chunk of the money being made off this book.  They didn't earn it.<br />I will read Allegiant.  I am sure I will see the flaws the reviewers are writing about.  But let's point the finger at all the people in her list of acknowledgements.  They didn't do their job.<br />They force you to fill in stars.  I put two because i am not really reviewing the book but rather the process of the creation.
6304078102|5.0|Good quality tape and glad to be able to get in VHS. One of the best music education movies to explain the current loss of such a necessary part of school for every child. Join band!
B0064MGU98|5.0|This series is full of drama and has your mind trying to help the lawyers. Your main character has always been one of my favorites ever since she was on E.R.<br />Definitely looking forward to the following Seasons.
006202406X|1.0|There is a lot to dislike about this book, and I feel like the negative reviews are justly deserved. My disappointment in this book has little to do with Tris' demise (although it is one of the disappointments of this book), but more to do with the fact that the writing in this book felt like it came from an entirely different author. The dual POVs did not work. As others have said, their voices sounded the same. Tobias, who is very distinct in the first two books, sounds just like Tris in this one. Let's talk about Tobias...he was like an entirely different character in this book! Way too trusting. Completely lacking the intensity of Divergent/Insurgent Tobias.<br /><br />The plot was plodding and pointless. When Insurgent ended, I closed that book, held it close and felt like it was going to be impossible to wait for book 3--I felt like some big stuff was going to go down in Allegiant, but that didn't happen. My thoughts as the story unfolded were as follows: 1. Something needs to happen. 2. Oh, ok...so there's that. 3. That's *it*?! 4. Well maybe something more is coming. 5. Nope. By the end of the book I just couldn't stand anyone. Also, what is the population of the Bureau? I imagine there has to be thousands of people, as there is a population to sustain, so how is it they were able to do anything with their plan without someone noticing them? Furthermore, they know that the Bureau is watching everything going on in the factions and yet there's never a camera on our heroes the entire time they are there, and as a result no one ever hears or sees that they are up to something?<br /><br />Sidenote: If the country is basically isolated from the world, and the cities/areas are isolated from each other...where do they get things like coffee?<br /><br />At the end of Insurgent, Tori's brother's name is Jonathan. In Allegiant it is George. How did that get overlooked?<br /><br />The first two books in this series are great. I was on board with everything, even thoughyou do have to kind of suspend disbelief for some things, but this third book is unforgivable. I'll go back and read the first two, but I'll never waste my time reading this third book again. I'll just imagine my own ending, I guess?
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Not as good as previous books. Seemed forced in the storyline. Almost like they had an ending and just forced the characters to get to it
B00FGM0IEU|5.0|If you have any interest in the origins of American R&B, soul and rock music, this is motive is a must see.
0307476073|4.0|Cheryl Strayed's meticulous memoir of her trek across the Pacific rim happened 15 years ago but it sounded like it occurred last month.  Though there are other ways to recover from the sudden and mean death of a mother and from a failed marriage, she carelessly chose this path for her recovery.  Her writing is crisp and candid, dark and exquisite.  I did not weep or feel shock at her dilemmas.  She skidded past potential terrors. Cheryl endured an immeasurable lack of creature comforts along the way.  Her serious problems arose from within herself, not so much from without.  I saw her as a complex, immature woman who blustered into her mistakes without apology.  Her planning was inadequate. Over and over the reader sees her nearing potential danger, then it fizzles into an inconsequential interaction, like almost stepping on a rattle snake.  Even at the end, Cheryl builds to a  positive potential laisson and she avoids it.. That in itself was good judgment, but she reached many precipices, so to speak, and never fell off.  Readers may view her story as a metaphor for life when we, who are flawed, too, make poor decisions and carry our lives on our backs as she did with Monster, her 80 lb. backpack.  Her fortitude saved her.  When her feet were bleeding and blistered she tapped her incredible strength and withstood excruciating pain and still continued to walk  more miles toward her goal!  She accepted that she didn't find all her answers on the trail or at the end.  jmq
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Once again Grisham nails it! He writes with such a grasp of the law and of human nature that the story grabs readers to pull them into a real life experience. There were tears in my eyes at the awful murder scene as well as when Anvil met Lettie. Love, jealousy, greed, hate, tolerance, redemption and making things right - all things were characterized. A great read!!
B005ETA5K2|5.0|I have used the device for sometime now and get great reception, especially at long distances. I did run into an issue with it and the customer service from Alfa has been exceptional. They have bent over backwards to get me a replacement unit. Thanks Alfa Network, I really love how you stand behind your products!
B004ULNJF8|5.0|I love this actor , he is my favorite action star. This movie was real good, not his best, but good.
B002MFV0UA|5.0|A very enjoyable comedy and a comment on society.  I would like to have Elwood P. Dowd as my friend and invite he and his 6ft. 3.5 inch  Pooka over for dinner. As described by Dowd,  Harvey is a pooka, a benign but mischievous creature from Celtic Mythology who is especially fond of social outcasts(like Elwood). Elwood and Harvey have driven Elwood's Sister and niece to distraction by introducing everyone  Elwood meets to his friend, Harvey.  Elwood's family seems to be unsure whether Dowd's obsession with Harvey is a product of his (admitted) propensity to drink or perhaps mental illness.  I like what Elwood had to say &#34;In this world, you have to be oh so smart or so pleasant&#34;  Well for Years I was smart, I recommend pleasant.&#34; This is certainly a great philosophy.  Another great quote from the movie is from the cab driver who said he had driven many folks to the sanatorium to receive some medicine and saying that if Elwood receives the medicine he will just be a normal human being and you know what stinkers they are.&#34;<br /><br />Jimmy Stewart's supporting cast is wonderful and works well together. Josephine Hull as Veta Louise Simmons, Peggy Dow as Miss Kelly, Charles Drake as Dr. Lyman Sanderson, Cecil Kellaway as Dr. William Chumley, William H. Lynn as Judge Gaffney, Victoria Horne as Myrtle Mae Simmons, Jesse White as Marvin Wilson and Harvey as Himself.  Two thumbs up watch this enjoyable comedy.
B004EPZ08Y|5.0|This is a really good movie, I loved it. There were some really good special effects as well. I think it is worth buying.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|It is a beautiful and heart warming book. It's sad and beautiful. It have me a lot of life lessons but the best was &#34;just because someone has it worse or someone has it better, it doesn't change the fact that you have what you have. Good or bad.&#34;
B009GESJH2|4.0|This was a brand new CD, and it played fine. It is kinda bluesy, and takes a while to really like it.
006202406X|1.0|Some people say that it wasn't Veronica Roth's responsibility to write an ending that made the fans happy. And I guess she doesn't have to. As a fellow author I would want people to enjoy the books I read. Not only for them, but for myself. The whole book felt rushed and disconnected from the other two fascinating books in the series. It wasn't just that it sucked, it didn't belong. Tris, Tobias, Christina and Evelyn all felt like totally different characters. I understand that characters grow and change but there was nothing familiar about them at all. It was sad to read a book I've been waiting for what seems like forever for and then it be terrible. I'm just completely disappointed.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|A good look into the Aristocratic life in England and Scotland as well as how the common man was viewed.
B001BANK32|5.0|I have read this book several times & it's always scary & always good! If you have only seen the movie, you are missing out. Read the book! It's great & I can't wait to read Dr. Sleep.  :)
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|It's like your favorite candy bar. You anticipate it for what seems an eternity, then you have it in your hands and you just devour it! After it's over, you think &#34;Wow.... When's the next one?&#34;  My business partner is another avid fiction reader. When I lamented the fact that I was close to the end of the latest Grisham book, she asked who that was. I was stunned and mentioned a few of his earlier works. She said she had heard of them, but had never read him.  As I finished this book and looked at the list of his previous novels, I envied her that she would get to enjoy so many months discovering this author. I just can't seem to get enough.  When's the next one?
B005DJREJS|5.0|Love this show, funny, ironic, a little bit crass. Love it!  We all can relate to those moments in high school where you are so embarrassed you want to die. This show is so much fun!
B00BB3UYS8|5.0|Author Brandt Legg weaves an imaginative tale of suspense in Outview. In the beginning, Nate, the protagonist, is experiencing an outview. An outview is similar to a horrible nightmare but much worse. The reader experiences this nightmare right along with Nate. My heart breaks for the tortured life that Nate lives. Blaming himself for the death of his father and dealing with the fact that his mother had his brother committed to a mental institution, leaves Nate feeling that he is alone in the world. On top of all of that, he fears that he is headed for the same fate as his brother.<br />With the help of his friends, Nate discovers that the outviews are only the beginning of his journey to self-discovery.<br />This is a well written YA read with everything from murder, mystery, and government secrets enhanced with paranormal aspects. You will be thinking about this book long after you have finished it.<br />I'm excited to read the next book of the `Inner Movement' series.<br />I highly recommend this book-----Five-Stars
B00EB6ENXO|1.0|If you're a Mac user or an iOS device owner that believes you should have control of the content you own, buy elsewhere. Movies from Amazon can't be downloaded to a Mac (only streamed - requiring an internet connection). Amazon movies can therefore never find their way into iTunes; the only way to get them on your iOS device is through Amazon's own app, thus separating them from the rest of your videos and forcing you to manage content through multiple apps. I will never buy from Amazon again (unless they fix this, and how would I know that they did?)
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I enjoyed this game it could use better animation with the character's in the game.  U should make it longer it was a little short.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|The stories are more correlated and complex. Direction is top notch and some of the characters have been elevated.<br />Its not always about Harvey and Mike in this season. A true masterpiece.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Great characters well developed. A little too much jumping from theme to them, but tied up at the end. Very fast Read and hard to put down. Highly recommended.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love young adult novels.  This book has further peaked my interest in Katniss and I wish that these books would never end.  It is a trail that you must follow and will leave you wanting more.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This was my first time playing a game out of the Persona series and I loved it. Yeah, the first like 5 hours is pretty much all talking but for some reason it all caught my interest and the story grabbed, I grew attatched to the characters and grew worried for them throughout the game. It's a great turn based game that should be in everyones collection.
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|*sigh* I do have a weak spot for young adult books, and this being the third in the trilogy really scratched my itch and wanting Maggie to write more.  This left me fluttery in the heart for days after reading.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book was amazing<br />Five stars and very adventurous one of the best books I have ever read can't what to read the next one!!!!!!!;)
B000JQUMPI|5.0|What can I say about this book?  It was a childhood favorite of mine that has a way of making me feel better on those rare days that I get to spend at home.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|Love the u k r&b sound somehow in the usa we forgot how to do a cd based on originality and with arrangements
B003NHRGSQ|5.0|I loved this second book of the trilogy, and it increased my desire to want the third one, even though I had to wait for the author to finish (it is out now).  This is a great series and scratched my itch for young adult novels, and it is nice to re-read it.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|This does what it says. Large easy to see features,very easy to use. The features are comprehensive and reliable. Great App.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Have I mentioned in my previous reviews that I love young adult novels?  Well, this being the third in the trilogy has me with a huge hole in my heart wanting more and more of Katness.
B00G32OER4|4.0|I'm not a huge fan of horror movies, but I thoroughly enjoyed this one.  It is not the most original as goes with most hauntings ie: Amityville, Haunting in Connecticut, etc...but it is very well made and moves along at a nice pace.  In fact, I would've enjoyed a longer version.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I am addicted to young adult novels. This book has sucked me, and being the first in a trilogy, made me read the following two books.  I love Katniss and her world, and how she handles herself.
B009VIZDLI|5.0|It got my attention since page 1.. I thought I was reading Sheldon Copper digest... its funny, cheaky, and makes you wonder... is it possible that there are guys like Professor Tillman out there???<br /><br />It's amazing!
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Oh Mr Darcy, how you pull at my heart!  This book has always been a favorite of mine and will always drag me down to crying and then back up to elation. *sigh* My heart!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I'm fairly new to the Kindle world, ( completely new. First and only tablet I own ).<br />I also got tired of update prompt for FB,so I deleted and downloaded what I assume is the latest version that Amazon app store has, any way problem solved.<br />  Now I have separate desktop and mobile versions , good or bad , I don't know but it works for me. Probably the wrong place but any feed back appreciated! Have a  ?  About skype also but I'll find the fight place.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|This was the first part to her trilogy about this special breed of wolves that started me down a path to love all of them myself.  This is a great read that will pull you in and won't let you up to breathe, just how I like my books!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I found this book very sad but at the same time inspirational to all those children in the world that there is a light for each of us.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This is an easy game to play. I really enjoy getting to new  levels and the daily and weekly challenges.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Interesting read, although a little far fetched in the world of reality. A scary look at a possible future. Would have preferred a happier ending!! 😎
B00EE3FVSU|5.0|Good character development and a lot of plot twists.<br />For adult audience.<br />You have to pay attention to the dialog - scots accent is sometimes hard to catch.
B003G4GMPO|4.0|Elvis Cole, Jack Reacher, Lucas Davenport, even Dave Robicheaux . . . these are great characters who solve crimes and bring justice into a bleak world. Hieronymus Bosch - Harry - has always been part of this list of flawed heroes. I just came to him late in my reading.<br /><br />The good news: I have many back adventures of Harry's to read, while I wait for the next adventures of the others mentioned. Yay!
B008FRJ1IW|5.0|My kids love Lego's, We were heading for a play date and decided to bring something with us so kids can play together, it was the hit of the day! It says 6-12 age group, my son is a mature 5 and he was able to do it with our supervision. Definitely a great buy!

B005H9B2CE|5.0|Characters were developed well. Costumes were great. Good against Evil plot with romance. Good moral lesson learned by Thor.<br />Must see movie.
B00F35BV64|5.0|Now ,  that is the way to do a new  star trek movie. 5  stars  and then some.  plot was good , the  characters came alive  ,  MONSTER FACES WERE MINIMAL, and the SS Enterprise  was  the way I had remembered it.  good job  all.  and $3.99  was way less than I paid for the original!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|It's a five star this is an amazing game. I can't go a week without this game. It should be 99&cent;

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book held my attention from start to finish!  I was so glad I was familiar with The Shining or it might not have made as much sense!  I loved how he tied the two together!
B005HJU7HA|5.0|This collection of Sir Conan Doyle's is a must-read, especially if you are a fan of Sherlock Holmes.  It has been my companion for many an enjoyable hour!
B00006AW63|1.0|This DVD plays only in Europe and neither myself or anyone else I know here in the USA could get this to play here!<br />Had to return it to Great Britain which cost me almost the cost of the DVD.  My fault, I realize, because I didn't read the description carefully enough.  Just a &#34;heads up!&#34;
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|I am not a scf-fi junky. Pacific Rim has a good story line, plausible, not too fantastic. I gave 3 stars because heroism and self sacrifice was a little 'over the top' in some scenes. If not, It would get 4 stars. Either way is not a movie that disappoints. It captivates.  I enjoyed it and you will too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I think it's great.challenges you brain.it's so much fun and exciting to play.i would recommend it to all my family and friends.
B00846F1YW|3.0|it gives pretty good reasons for searching for stuff.<br />easy to zoom and scroll.  at least using a kindle fire.

B00514908S|5.0|Excellent cast with a script to match.  A little offbeat, often hilarious, but with great heart.  Thoroughly enjoyable!  A young crazy Kevin Costner and a wonderfully tongue in cheek performance by Kevin Klein.
B00FGH3TGO|5.0|The love club is rhythm candy for your ears.  The lyrics are surprising deep for a young woman especially when you look at the crap American pop stars pump out.  Well done album all the way around.

193700788X|4.0|What the heck?  I feel like there were way too many loose ends for the ending of a series.  It ended almost too abruptly as if Charlaine Harris was just tired of the characters that she's been writing for years.
B008MM9630|5.0|awesome game me any my girls love it !! just a lil buggy tho...other than that I would def. recommend
B00G32OER4|4.0|Pretty scary. It's another demon possession movie and they all start to look the same after a while. This movie did give me nightmares.

B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Clones is a fairly common topic in sci-fi, but I don't know that it has ever been done this well on TV. The special effects with multiple clones on the screen are seamless and Tatiana Maslany is brilliant at playing each of her characters (sometimes playing one character trying to impersonate another one). The plot is fun and the show effortlessly moves between sci-fi, thriller, comedy, and drama. Excellent show and I hope its popularity will continue to grow!
B005DWBO0K|5.0|I just love this dvd. The 1st ever vampire movie. It still freaks out my wife that she has to be next to me and holding my arm.
B00AKKS278|5.0|Thank you Hal Elrod!<br /><br />I was skeptical that this book would just be about waking up early, but it is so much more. Hal Elrod digs deep to help us recognize why we have been staying up late and sleeping in and helps us make REAL life changes. Just like how not everyone who buys a weight-loss product, gets a club membership, or starts something like P90X will truly decide to take upon themselves the responsibility of changing their life and being consistent; the same is true here. This program will work with you if you TRULY give it your all and become committed to developing a morning routine as outlined by Hal Elrod. All the results in his life are currently enjoyed because he implemented this program. I've finally begun to consistently wake up in the morning when I used to immediately turn off my alarm and go back to bed. My results have changed to say the least. I even caught myself promoting this book to a friend last week!<br /><br />Keep on creating these great materials that have provided value to so many!
B00FG1Q5J8|5.0|I actually have never played this game however,<br />me and my boyfriend are big pc gamers and never really play mobile games.<br />Since downloading this game my BF has been playing it every night! He actually chooses to play this game over going straight to the computer to play other pc games, which really says a lot! The soundtrack is awesome too!

B000ANVPPQ|5.0|I love this movie. It is my all time favorite John Wayne movie. It is so entertaining.Lots of fun to watch.
006202406X|1.0|OK, so I didn't get a tattoo but, I did LOVE this series. So I will keep this short, I hate this book, not going to see the movie, and I wish Roth all the best but, I will never trust her enough to invest my time in reading anything else she writes in the future.
B004QX07G4|4.0|If you enjoy Ellen, you will enjoy this book.  Although it is very funny she does give some good advice and important life lessons.  I liked this book, but nothing can substitue Ellen's humor in real life.

B003VPWXRO|5.0|Written so beautifully and from such a vulnerable place.  Would recommend this to anyone who has had issues w/ food or addiction of any kind.  Don't believe you have to have a full blown eating disorder or addiction to relate to this story.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|This is an absolute dvd to have in your collection if you are an Eagles fan.  I believe it has most of their famous songs and the audio and video plays perfectly on my home theater system.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Very insightful book about the federal prision system.  It was sometimes sad, sometimes funny and very well written and entertaining.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I have loved Stephen King since I was a child.....I was scared to death of The Shining, but Doctor Sleep was a really good book.  If you have not read The Shining I think if you read this book you will not be lost, very little if so.  Stephen King and Danny (Dan) are a perfect match.  Happy Reading

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I just downloaded this game and this game is blowing my mind i'm like going cra cra and I just rated it and guess what I rated it to I love it
B005LAII8A|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite. I love the premise behind it. Time travel, killers, and revenge has never been put together so good. Bruce Willis and Joseph Gordon-Levitt made this movie so much fun to watch. I must admit there was a moment it nearly lost me because of what the lead character did, but I kept watching and began to understand. [I didn't approve really, but it's apart of the story].<br /><br />Without really telling spoilers, Levitt plays a young Willis. It is based in the future, and they are killers. Levitt is literally sent people to kill, and he is supposed to get rid of them. If not, there's a price to pay. The hook to this story is one of the people that Levitt is supposed to get rid of. It's not so easy, and the movie really takes off.<br /><br />Levitt and Bruce are excellent actors. I have enjoyed Levitt's work in Inception, and Bruce in all kinds of movies. I recommend this movie, and I further recommend to pause it if you have to leave. You don't want to miss a single detail of this story.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|Star Trek has always presented timely topics in an intriguing way. The hallmark of the show has always been high production values.
B004U7JYXS|5.0|The film was shipped to me quickly.  It is exactly as described.<br />It will be going with some other items for a Christmas gift and<br />is exactly as pictured and described.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This was not the type story I would normally read.  I couldn't put it down and have just started book 3!  Enjoyed the book from start to finish!
B005LJJESY|5.0|I haven't got this yet but I do like Ryan Reynolds he is a great actor and he is amazing
0345803485|1.0|The writing in this book is absolutely terrible & I find myself wondering how this person got a book deal. The only reason this book got this far? Word of mouth. I am guilty of reading it only to \\"see what all the fuss is about.\\" Save your time....
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I know lots of people have issues with this book as the other reviews will show, but I think it truly was a fitting end to the series.  It was by no means what I was expecting when they decided that they would want to find out the truth of the outside at the end of Insurgent, but it was excellent.  The threat was so much more sinister because it wasn't immediately apparent.  The themes were excellent from facing fears to choosing what is right instead of what is easy.  The characters grow, but their choices fall in line with their descriptions and the characteristics that we have seen over the last two novels.  We may not be happy with what they decide or do, but all their actions felt right for them as characters.  Yes, sad things happen, but I will take the realism and love shown in Allegiant any day over a sappy happily-ever-after.  Well done Veronica Roth!
B009GFEOY8|2.0|Well, well. It is great that there is a company that does Polaroid film again. And other films of the impossible project seem to work well (though i haven't tried any). But the PX70 is quite a pain. It takes at least 40 min to develop and in cold October weathers up to 2h. If light hits the film (only for a second is enough) it renders awkward colors (well, some will like them, though they are mostly beige) and greens are completely missing in my exposures. Also fine details in faces are absent (probable because skin is beige?). It looks more like skin is continuously overexposed. For 3$ a shot I would like to have a better product - at least in terms of developing time. I have old original expired polaroid film, although the colors are off too, I get a picture in 2 minutes.
B003U4ZQRK|5.0|Season 5 of Lost introduces a lot of new twists to the story with the &#34;flash sideways&#34; storylines.  HD Video quality for the Amazon streaming video is not up as good as Blu-ray, but is acceptable.
B001RTSPVY|5.0|If you love  Breaking Bad , this is  a  must keeper.  The  DVD's play  perfectly &  have  had no problems.  Thank you.
0743298039|5.0|This is one of the best books I have read in a long time. If I didn't know any better, I would think this is one of the classics written a couple of centuries ago, just by looking at the writing style.  Some parts of the book and the descriptions of some of the  characters sound a lot like writings of Charles Dickens. So is the surprising, unexpected and bitter sweet  ending.<br /><br />In spite of the fact the subject matter of the book  is very depressing, the writing style of the book is  intriguing and suspenseful and is not depressing at all. There isn't any event or a person in this book one  can relate to,  but still the story telling is priceless and keeps one sitting on the edge of one's seat, wondering what is coming next and wanting to know more. Reading this  book is like savoring a gourmet meal in a sense that the impression that has made on one still lingers long after it is finished.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|If you  don't  watch this  show (or  used to  watch it  when it was on)  you  really should. It is  awesome.  Great  DVD addition. No problems w/them at all.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|Packaging and instructions were very good, but repeated trials always ended with &#34;extension failed&#34;.<br /><br />Reassembly made no difference. I am excusing the poor performance, blaming the wi fi signal strength.<br /><br />Does Chromecast have any other uses ?  I was enthusiastic about the original purpose . John B
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My granddaughter loves this game. I like the fact I can get money and stuff for her while she is not here.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|Great acting and actors...nice story that made me feel like this really happened somewhere in time. We all have mental illness of some kind at different times in our lives, its nice to know that if you persevere at something it can happen and other things happen along the way which makes everything so much better.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|I enjoyed reading a book that took place in Australia and was written by an Australian. The characters were interesting. And the plot really made you think. What would you do, if this happened to you??? How would you handle things?<br /><br />The ending also was thought provoking.
B00E8B1358|3.0|I fell asleep with my husband during this one... Even with the awesome actors, it just wan't original and interesting.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I absolutely fell in love with the story and its characters. I hope the movie does it justice. Zusak is an exceptional writer and I thoroughly enjoyed his story telling style. The Book Thief captured my imagination and my heart. I was captivated by both the extreme tragedy the characters endured as well as their tiny treasured moments which many of us would take for granted today. This book is truly something special.
B00BGIC3T6|4.0|The previews made it out to be a lot funnier than it was. The movie was actually fairly serious and almost a drama.
B00G32TD98|1.0|Not worth the time, unless you're in it for the shock factor. Other than that, not a scary movie. Boo.
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|The story line is interesting and stays true to the other movies as well. It actually makes me hope for a 4th!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love candy crush . So happy to see it finally on the Kindle....Keep up the good work and give us more kindle games from King.com
B00F91RYL8|2.0|Good make up though!<br />Brad is flat and his family are paper cut-outs.<br />Not recommended. I turned it off after 2/3 of the movie and watched the rest the next day, only to be bored by the continuing repetitive plot. Typical Hollywood ending, naturally.
B00BHJ0MY2|4.0|This is a good album if you are starting to try or already have an interest in \\"World Music\\".  It is a very high 3 1/2 stars.  If you are familiar with the Putumayo Label of world music and wish the cd's/albums were more \\"cohesive\\" & \\"consistent\\" and a little less obviously \\"commercial\\" this is a recording for you.  It is interesting that the music is in three languages ( French, English, and Bambara).  The liner notes include the lyrics.  I enjoy it, but if you are trying Ms. Traore for the first time, I suggest you try her album \\"Tchamantche \\", it is definitely a 4 star.
B00G32OER4|3.0|Pretty good movie. Same thing as every other scary movie but done well. Stupid ppl following stupid sounds but thats scary movies for ya good halloween movie.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I can't say enough good about this book! The insight and humor it was written with were refreshing. I couldn't put it down! I fell in love with both the characters and their stories. I was sad to see the story end. I wanted more. But Mr. Green knew just how much was enough. Thank you for such an incredibly light-hearted look into such a delicate subject. Kudos!

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The android version of this game is definitely much better than the Facebook version. It is completely different and more enjoyable. You can also connect to your Facebook friends directly from the app. Excellent game. Definitely recommend.

0062225790|3.0|I enjoyed the descriptions of all the family members. How so many generations attended Balliol College, and what they got from their experiences and education. The fact that Richard had a taste of Africe and how it relates to him. His appreciation of all those many friends and colleagues who helped and inspired him. I found him a humble man, he realizes that his hard work and love for his subject lead to his fame. I am lucky to have found him and loved the many books of his that I have read.<br />Margaret Reid - South Africa
B001MSMUH0|5.0|Dr. Robinson is not saying that everyone can be a Mick Jagger or a Mick Fleetwood or some such. He's saying that our current education systems for the most part are geared for the 19th and 20th centuries, and that we have passed by the conditions that gave birth to the educational system, but few have noticed and made the required adjustments. When you read, pay attention to examples of what works. It's important.
B004U7JYXS|4.0|I thought I was going to get an unopened box, I ended up with 2 2-packs and a single cartridge. The single cartridge was almost damaged. I'd rather just purchased 6 so they would all come in a box.
B00AYQNOFI|5.0|This movie needs a IMAX screen to do it justice, not a 47inch HD tv on my entertainment center.  Just a incredible visual journey.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|I love this game because of the learning and learning and learning , also I just did the phrases in Spanish and it was so fun! I hope that whoever reads this review will play or try the game Duolingo will like it as much as I do !
B007EC27QM|5.0|Great, basic ten key type of calculator.  Easy to use, keys large enough that you are accurate.  Good for anyone who grew up with ten keys
B003O86FMW|5.0|I really can't find a way to describe how great this book is and at the same time I'm so in love with the characters I'm upset at different turns and excited , it a rollercoaster of emotions for sure but the one thing  that rings true is just like the first I couldn't put it down .
B0045KS6M0|5.0|I love this movie. I have loved it through repeated viewings. It is compelling. The actors are terrific. The period detail is wonderful. This is some of Jodie Foster's very best work. Richard Gere is flawed and convincing and wonderful as well. I'm not sure it's an accurate representation of the post-civil war south, but it certainly could be an accurate representation of one town's part of it. One of the most romantic movies ever, with a plot twist based on a true story. Watch it for it's sheer beauty and appreciate it for its strength.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I never thought I would get so sucked into a book again then I picked up this one and I could not get enough I only hope the next two are as exciting and intriguing !!
B003G4W49C|5.0|This book gets 5 stars! I enjoyed it and think other kids my age and middle/high school kids would like to read . I felt like I was really there!!

B006M7JCC2|5.0|You should read this book and you will see why it gets a five star rating!  Probably one of the most important books I have ever read regarding why we are here on earth and a peak into what it will be like on the other side.  If everyone on earth read this book and took Anita Moorjani's advice to heart, our world would be a much, much better place!
B0088W6IMQ|5.0|I have enjoyed watching this show, sometimes you wonder why they cancel great shows like this one..bring it back for another season..can I ask why there is a word limit?  I find that quite stupid. And I am going to need your response to be 10 words or more thank you.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|The conclusion of this series is great. Totally unexpected and just heartbreaking. I recommend the series to everyone and the author in general.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|The Movie was a remake of the original version,however, the Directors did an amazing job. I really enjoyed the Movie.
B003G4W49C|4.0|A long detailed read but very interesting. Read it because the movie was coming out. It ain't doctor spocks child rearing guide
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Great special effects.  No acting, no script development, herky jerky story, you don't much care about the whole thing.  In time you become numb to the over-blown rockem' sockem' action.<br /><br />This could have been good too.  A little effort, thought and some acting would made a fine movie.  What a waste.  One of those movies where a couple trailers show you all that was worth seeing anyway. Don't waste your time.
B00B0X4PIO|5.0|You dont want it to end but it must, a definite re read book to fully appreciate the tale being told
B000OCXIDK|4.0|The picture is timeless and begs for a back story - this is a quick and intriguing read which serves nicely.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is absolutely addicting!  It can also be frustrating when you so close to clearing a level and you run out of matches and then you run out of lives!  I wish you had more lives and/or replenished quicker, but that won't stop me from playing on my phone and my tablet!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use my kindle for every thing I use on my laptop.  I never go ANYWHERE without my Kindle in my purse.
006202406X|1.0|There's a reason why this book has recieved so many one starred reviews. I don't have much to add to it: I have the same problems with this book as most of the other low starred reviews.<br /><br />I'm going to go through a couple of my main issues anyway, spoilers are indicated.<br /><br />1. I was initially SUPER excited when I read that Allegiant would be from the perspective of Tris AND Four. I read one of Four's short stories (The Transfer), and while I didn't love it- it was decent. I wouldn't buy all four of them though--- especially after reading Allegiant. Charging $2 for each short story (The Transfer was maybe 40 pages long?) = $8.. What a rip-off and obvious trick to get more money.<br />I'm getting off track though- Tris and Four's POV read as if they are the SAME person. There were points where I forgot which person I was reading simply because they both sounded the same.<br /><br />2. Weak characters- I loved the character of Four. He was interesting, smart, and fun to read about. Tobias should have still read as Four, since they're the same character! But getting into the mind of Tobias was like reading a whiny brat and acted as someone I wouldn't associate as Four. As for Tris, she was too one-dimensional. Just because you're writing a 16 year old character doesn't mean you have to write poorly.<br /><br />3. Boring romance-kissing kissing... more kissing. I get it. It's a romance. I like romance! The writing was over the top though, and the romantic moments seemed kind or ridiculous and off-beat with the rest of the plot. **SPOILER** I found the sex scene... (was it a sex scene?) unnecessary.<br /><br />4. Crazy plot holes. **SPOILER** What happens  to the rest of the United States? We're introduced to a big world outside Chicago. By the end of the book though, it's as if Chicago is the only city. Making one city believe that GD are the same as GP does nothing for the big picture.<br /><br />5. Too unbelievable. There were too many aspects of the story that were too ridiculous to believe. The story depended too much on the serum.There's a limit to what's plausible for the story. Allegiant not only pushed that limit, but went past it.<br /><br />I know it's basically the same complaints as other reviewers... but I also wanted to share my disappointment. I've held off on a review for a few days because I hoped that letting the ideas sink in would change my thinking. Unfortunately, 5 days later and I still think that this was a terrible book. *sighs*

0553385461|5.0|Having read A Brief History Of Time, I wasn't sure how much I would get out of this updated rewrite. I haven't sat down with each book to outline differences but as in the first book, Hawking is such an amazing teacher, I felt I understood everything he wrote. Until I tried to explain any of it to someone who had not read the book. It's a credit to such a brilliant mind that he is able to simplify what is extremely complicated physics and math so a non physicist could understand it. I took two courses in Calculus 35 years ago but Hawking requires no knowledge of any higher math for the reader to enjoy a terrific read
B00G32TD98|4.0|This movie was not too bad. It had its moments that made you jump. The actress who played Loraine Warren did a great job.
B00846REIS|5.0|Amazing!!! Anxious to continue to the next one. Great reading with a good story. A real page turner.  Really feel like your a part of the story and you personally know the characters.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|The old Wii went out of service on us so we needed something that we could use Netflix. This little gadget is great. It's. Simple to use and can be operated from the home  computer or my kindle fire. The best part is the price.You just can't beat $35.00.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Great writing, directing, and acting.  A show for those who love a thrill whole being thuroughly entertained!  You will be engaged the entire time!
B009PK9SB8|4.0|I found the LCD back very helpful in setting up the camera for the wildlife photos that I take. It helps get the camera aimed correctly, but more importantly the menu system using the touch screen assures a quick review of the camera's settings to be sure everything is the way I want it for the shots I expect to get. I can even read the data on the back without my glasses, which is a blessing. I then generally take the back off the camera while waiting to shoot the birds as it uses a lot of power as you can imagine. The screen is clear and sharp, and wonderfully allows replay of videos shot without having to go to the computer. I think the back is well worth the cost.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I feel let down. There's nothing I can say that everyone else hasn't already. I'm just sad. I will never buy, read, borrow or even use for kindling, another one of her books again. I will not be watching the movies either.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|She leads one to suspect a few for the murders and gets one<br />holding through to the very end...will try more of her books.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I don't understand why everyone is putting this book down. Yes it had issues: as do all books. The negative reviews ALMOST stopped me from buying this great book: don't be fooled,  READ THIS SERIES!
B00FAEPX9Y|4.0|Great first album by this 16 yr old who has a great vocal range.  Song writing has depth unlike other young artists.  &#34;Royals&#34; is a catchy song.  I wish her the best and I will give her next album a listen!
B00FX8EY60|3.0|this is an okay album. no where close to as good as the previous two albums. there are a few good songs.
B002361MLA|4.0|Once you start this book it will be almost impossible to go back to old ways of thinking or &#34;being&#34;.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Large font, easily used.  Many of the other reviews have described it much better than I can.  I chose this app pretty much at random when I first got my kindle. Now I can't say enough positive things about it.  I only encourage you to get it for your every day needs
B008Y7DV70|5.0|Such a great movie. Yes it's a strange idea, yes it's science fiction, blah blah. But in the end if you have an inch of depth to your soul then you will find a deeper motivational meaning hidden in this film.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Only two chapters into this book, I knew I was going to be in trouble. I never should have picked it up. I never should have started reading. The problem is that I cannot be unbiased towards this work or its contents. Much like the author John Green, I too am a writer with several novels on the market. Unlike John, my books have not been successful. My foolish assumption was that the sincerity of the work is a direct indicator of the success of a project. Apparently that has never been true. My naivete is to blame here. What I have awkwardly discovered is the sales of a book are relative to the size of audience that the celebrity has an emotional bond with. If the writer in question is not a celebrity, there may never be an audience to follow.<br /><br /> Why did I pick up this title? Perhaps I was hoping that if I read one of John's books and found him to be an outstanding writer then I would be happy about his success, elated that he is getting his just rewards. Yet with every page I was rolling my eyes and sagging my head. The Fault in our Stars is a love story between teenagers who have been dealt a bad hand but it is a hand that comes with “Cancer Perks” as John put it. It is the kind of story where no one would ever dare question the integrity of the characters due to their circumstances. However, I had to question the characters. They are fictional after all, “Scratches on a page.” They do not represent the pain of real people like my Aunt and Mother who had Cancer or my Uncle and Grandmother who both died from it. Not everyone gets wishes but yet I continued reading...<br /><br /> As I questioned these ghosts, I kept seeing through the thin assumptions. Instead of filling in the gaps, as no reader should have to, I kept doubting the motivations and intent of the author. I kept hearing his voice booming out of impossibly intelligent monologues. I could not, no matter how hard I tried, suspend my disbelief. Each misplaced notion jumped off the page projecting a stretch of credulity. Each simple conversation felt like a sleepy walk in the park, like a cover band complacent to play whatever song the audience desired to hear. In the harshest terms I would call this book commercially contrived, a search engine soup of teenage emotions painted with an algorithmic brush. Yet, I continued reading...<br /><br /> Despite having said these unpleasant things, I would suggest that you should also read it. As I have admitted, I am jaded in the worst possible way. The truth is that I'm a huge fan of John Green and his brother Hank. I adore what they are doing to better educate today's “internet infected” youth. I wish them all the luck that their hard work and creativity can produce. That is why I feel terrible about writing this. I wanted to like the book as much as I like them. I wanted to rise above my petty jealousy by giving John a proper review, but I can't or I couldn't, at least not at first.<br /><br /> Perhaps my stories are a true reflection of myself. No one could ever relate to the misadventures of my unusual and tragically disadvantaged life. My books are the same way – too unique for public bonding. Therein lies the real quandary. John writes about the people and places that slowly transformed him into the amazing person he is today. Maybe that is why his stories are becoming as beloved as he is. Conversely my path created a writer who is merely “A failed experiment” and due to my faults, I'm not so easy to love. That's when it hit me. I'm just like the characters – damaged by fate, grasping for meaning, wrestling with obscurity and doomed against the tides. Suddenly I too could relate to this story.<br /><br /> Just because the vessel of the message is flawed doesn't mean that the message is not important. The Fault in our Stars is that only some people get to enjoy the peaks of idyllic destinies while others merely survive the troughs. The latter must accept that the only ride they have ever knownis the best they will ever have, that they can't change the stars. It will all be over before anyone truly grasps what has happened or what was lost. With this sentiment John has elevated the argument for compassion. I had to read a little longer and search a little deeper to get his meaning but I found it and it was worth finding.<br /><br /> By the end of the book my cynicism had died. Disbelief bled from my eyes like a river that was part guilt, part self pity. I cried because I knew how meaningful this story would be for many people and I feared I might never write one to match its beauty. This journey had been emotionally traumatic. Now that it is over I feel better about my place in the world. I feel grateful for those who have come to appreciate me. Maybe I was never meant to match the absurd expectations of my imagination but that's a good thing. If I had too much of the wrong attention, I'd never be properly focused on those who deserve my love and affection.<br /><br /> As for the movie, I'm sorry to say that I won't be watching it. I simply can't go through all of this again.is the best they will ever have, that they can't change the stars. It will all be over before anyone truly grasps what has happened or what was lost.

B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|Amazing movie if you like the sci-fi genre. The  film has a great mix of action humor plot and fantastic special effects.
B002VWNIDG|5.0|Hey it's The Scream Queen here, I just can't get over how fun Halloween is this year; and since I'm celebrating with my annual tradition of watching Stephen King movies, and have done my review for the re-make, I thought I'd write one for this 2 (don't worry I love them both. And after watching this on DVD last night I noticed a few things (even though my friend The Nostalgic Critic made a very good review) I noticed something last night. Even though Jack is played by Jack Nicholson who is pretty much the same in every role (I'm not saying he's not awesome though) They make the reference that he's just playing Jack Torrence as well, Just &#34;Jack&#34; when that Isn't true....(even my friends noticed this. Take the beginning.....when they're driving in the car...and he's talking about The Donner party. He's still being his Scary self.....but it's the start of how the character is. Then we have when he's upstairs....he's trying to write but nothing's coming in a bad case of Writers block before he starts getting Cabin fever....and the Nightmares. Now this is another thing as Shelly Duvall walks into the hedge maze with Danny (and Shelly Duvall is NOT as bad as Everyone says (and now that I've seen both movies I actually like BOTH casts.) And one of the best scenes is when the ghost start up Jacks drinking problem again, now I always loved this scene. We were all reading about this as well and it said in this internet encyclopedia....that the rooms in here don't make ANY logical sense. But the only rooms that seem off..are the hallway the girls are in, the Gold ballroom and that weird bedroom, and these are my favorite rooms in the place (but I also love Every room in the Hotel ( in both movies....with no surprise to my guy or Any of my friends....Room 237 being my favorite.) But then with how I am, what I like to watch, and what I like to write....I was born to be scary.
0061950726|4.0|I would have paid for this book it was that good.  I love historical fiction books that flow smoothly and keep me interested.  I highly recommend this book and suggest you keep some tissues handy. Happy reading.
B0055D3EFU|1.0|and this was no exception. Useless movie. How many more bad movies in this genre are people going to make.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|This app is a waste.  It will download for the first hour that it is on my phone but after that it stops working. First it just does not try to download any video and after that the app won't even stay open.  really sucks.
B00E0SXNE8|4.0|The Movie was great, but purchasing the movie in HD for streaming was the same quality as watching a Bootleg version. I have great internet connection and stream HD through other browsers fine.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|It was ok...a couple of things in the book actually grossed me out....and that's not easy to do....jus wasn't the book for me...wish I never purchased it....but all is good....the hype of this book did not deliver.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|If you're looking for old school shooters with great music and effects, this is the right for you.<br />Worth the dollar!
1423170148|5.0|The illustrations in this book are breathtaking! Anyone with a child or a sister needs to own this amazing book!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Love the music.  This was so mind blowing, I had to play it 3 times all the way through. Only problem was that it was too short.  Game should have gone for several more chapters.  Can`t wait for The Room 2'  Hope it lasts longer.  Fireproof games puts a lit of innovation in their games.  Way to go......
B006MW3V6U|3.0|Love this show! Season 2 is great! As for what amazon prime offers, the first episode of season 2 and 3 for free isn't a big incentive when you have to pay for each episode after. I can watch it else where for less. Still, 3 stars because the show is great.
0399255370|5.0|My daughter said she loves it! If she's happy, Im happy. The book was in perfect condition. And it was at a low price.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Cute. A few clever twists on Bejeweled.  This won't become one of my obsession games.  Not had a problem on my Kindle Fire running it.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I am anxiously anticipating the movie because I have to see how they take this face melting awesomeness and adapt it to the screen. I think that so far the series has been perfectly cast and I hope the newbees are just as awesome. I won't give any spoilers, but I will say unless you have had the twists spoiled for you, you are in for a jaw-breaking-through-the-floor-dropping surprise.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I love Downton Abbey and cant wait for season 4 to be available.  This is the first show my husband can agree on he likes it just as much as I do.  I do hope they continue to keep our intrest I do like the time we spend together watching this show.
B000TM1CKQ|5.0|The title explains it all, folk. Tis the most legendary of all legendary things. I proclaim it in Barnibus Stinson's name
B00B8R1NP0|1.0|A killer whose target is people who waste his time... an interesting premise, and one that could have been a fascinating read, except for the hokey writing style and completely predictable story progression. It would have been easier to read a conversational style. As for the plot development: No evidence ever left behind, not even trace - come on now; I guess the lab isn't looking that hard, and I guessed he was a car salesman very early on. The coincidence of the investigating officer (spoiler alert) being the three-year old victim left alive 25 years ago was too obvious from the first mention of his dreams. Having the detectives glean so much from the murder scenes, yet not be able to profile the killer, just annoyed me. The neatly wrapped up ending was also all too formulaic and predictable.
B009LH1WLO|5.0|Best Supernatural episode yet!  Just watched this one and Swoon, when the tent's a rockin' don't come a knockin'.  Felicia Day - \\"I'm the one who saves damsels in distress around here\\" and then a nice nerdy lesbian kiss!  :)  Even Dean can't help but get into some of the quirky LARP action in the end.  Great fun episode.
B0018STVHQ|3.0|I can't help comparing it to the book.  I love the screen time given to the Boleyn parents, but so much else was missing.<br />Fine acting performances from most.
B000MHY03Y|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I didn't think I would, based on some of the comments on this site, but I did. The story of Connie and Mellors is sweet, honest and moving.
B00DMK6WN4|5.0|So I wasn't sure a sequel or prequel in this case could be worth while, but Monsters University is amazing!  It is the story of Mike as a  little monster who had a big dream of being a scarer.  He shows determination, confidence and the smarts to make it to college and into the Scaring Program.  He meets Sully the first day and they are huge opposites.  First they compete against each other but learn that to make it they need to work together.  They become true friends and show awesome teamwork and make a few friends along the way.  It is a great story with great lessons for kids.  We laughed and laughed throughout this movie, which by the way we have watched more times than I can count already!  The animation is so bright and colorful, its hard not to like it.<br /><br />I received this title to review in exchange for sharing my honest opinion.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Really enjoyed this book. I felt like I was trying to put a big puzzle together. Even when I wasn't reading it I found myself trying to figure it out. Already recommend it to my friends!
1490313370|4.0|It was an interested book. It was a quick read and easy to understand. I will most likely read it again.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I find this to be a very challenging game at each level. It is also very addicting. I enjoy reaching new levels &amp; seeing friends names on the different levels. I'm not crazy about needing help from friends to advance in levels, it should be of my own doing.
B001DRF84W|4.0|&#34;The Start&#34; of it all.  Excellent movie development and direction of script and characters to lead the Hulk on his adventure in Marvel World.
B0040FMG2G|5.0|Crowe executes a splendid performance recreating life on a ship of the line. Well worth watching on cold stormy nights when the intensity of crossing the cape can be truly understood.
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|An Excellent &#34;Return to Khan&#34; movie for Star Trekkies who know the history of Khan. The &#34;Wrath was Spectacular&#34; !
1401923127|5.0|To start with, I have no experience with Psych-K and probably never will, but I do have a science background. This is simply the amazing story of a biologist willing to admit that he doesn't know it all, that \\"it\\" appears to be beyond our understanding, BUT that \\"it\\" also appears to be the result of intelligent design or control. That of course is something few scientists are willing to admit, with the exception of Einstein, who said \\"God does not play dice with the universe.\\" Highly recommended.
006202406X|4.0|I am still mulling over this book a few hours after finishing. I cannot say for sure whether I liked the ending or not, but I understand why Veronica Roth went this way. Rather than be angry for not getting the ending most everybody wanted, I thought about what led to that, which I think most readers should do, rather than just be mad and post a negative review.<br /><br />While there were inconsistencies with characters and plots, and I agree with others, not a big difference between Tobias's and Tris's POV's, I feel that these characters are much more complex than many I read about, and ultimately, they did not deserve an ending that tied everything up too neatly. It wouldn't have done them justice.<br /><br />I look forward to seeing what else VR will do with her writing.
B0055V6EZE|5.0|This is an Awesome  CD  and i have gotten the other one he has so  5 stars to all he does.<br />Really love it, and hate to keep talking after all i have said above.<br />Awesome man, voice and CD
0345803493|5.0|Haven't read such a hot juicy book like this since Hollywood Wives.  This book is well worth your money for a good read.  Make sure the young ones aren't around to read this hot one!
B00F35BV64|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie.  I had to watch it twice because it was so good.  I would definitely recommend it!  Thanks Amazon!
0345803507|5.0|This Trilogy is well worth &#34;Good Read&#34; on my list.  This book was so hard to put down, it kept me wanting whats going to happen next.  Looking forward to the movie.  Disappointed that Hunnam is not going to play Christian.
B004JMY312|5.0|Great Halloween movie for kids & adults.  A classic of my generation!  Funny, touching, well-acted, & well-filmed.  Highly recommended for all generations!
B00CEQ1JOO|5.0|Twyla is one of the newer dolls this year. Get her before prices go up. Very good prices right now and you don't have to keep checking the shipments at Toys R Us.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I almost wish I had never found this .. but it has all but cured my snoozing-too-many-times problem. If you use the math setting to snooze or dismiss the alarm, the thought it takes to do the math problem will make you think twice about snoozing again. If you want something to keep you from snoozing, this is it!! Also, it was free.
B00CKH9WOQ|5.0|I haven't given this to my daughter yet, as it's for her birthday but the doll is very unique and hard to find.if you want to long prices will go up around the holidays,
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game but i need neighbors. Add me? ID is angelolacrime ..earning coins is a little though and everything is so expensive in the design section.
B00B5AP7NY|5.0|This movie is pretty popular in my house, but I agree it's almost like the game just in movie form. My kids didn't care. They enjoy watching it and I'm glad I bought it.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|You ever heard the term, &quot;If it ain't broke don't fix it&quot;? My app was working great and I did NOT want to download the new update but I was bombarded with it asking me to do that. I always exed it off, it was very annoying, until it updated itself! Now the dang thing locks up every time, it won't connect with YouTube and when it does connect it won't play more then a few seconds. I should have the CHOICE as to whether or not I want your update, not harrassed and forced. I am so tired of being forced to download app updates on various apps and it completely ruining my app and making it non functional. Please at least give us the CHOICE and don't pester us non stop to download the update. This is really wrong.
1465408681|5.0|My 5 year old is obsessed with Star Wars. I would recommend this as well as some of the othe books (of course with the mini figures)

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is highly additive, lots of fun and challenging. I have it on my cell phone, my computer my iPod and now my kindle.<br />Great game. Thanks kindle, for another reason not to get anything done.  :&#62;)

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I find it very challenging and difficult to put down.<br />I find the game to be very relaxing and enjoyable. I especially enjoy playing when waiting on appointments.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it but when we pay for lives we should get more than 5 moves for 99&cent; that's a rip off
B00F56AZK4|5.0|They are fun to do without the worry that you dropped or lost a piece. I like it. It's fun.
B0016YBFZ8|5.0|My favorite movie. Great acting. Amazing detail. Always worth a watch. It is up there with any classic you can think of
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Found this fun and challenging at times. I would recommend this game for ages 8-99...Found myself playing for periods of time.  Try it now and decide for yourself.  Have fun!
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Alarm works perfectly. It is User friendly, easy to use and I like design.  Good, very good, very -very good!
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|I hadnt really listened to anything by pearl jam before this album, being exposed to Jeremy and Alive, left me with the impression that they were kinda a dark band.  i will admit it, I was wrong.  I absolutely love this album, and it has helped me to appreciate all of the other great music they have put out.
B001BANK32|5.0|One of King's best books. Scary and satisfyingly disturbing. I highly recommend reading the sequel, Dr. Sleep, after finishing this one.
B00ERIUO02|5.0|I bought this cd on sale in the mall. I got it for 11.99 at F.Y.E. . I listened to it, it is one awesome CD! I love Roar, unconditionally, and Birthday. Those were my fave songs also Floating on air. It was a good buy. I'd highly recommend it to any Katy perry fan.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Glad to have the last installment of the series but disappointed with the conclusion of the book. Not a fan of the \\"bow tied\\" ending this seemed to have.
1439152810|4.0|I wanted to read all of her books. My book club read her story and also researched Kate Morton. She has a knack for weaving intrigue into her well researched story.
B00EY7LT9Q|3.0|This show really tells me that Whedon isn't in control of his own show. Maybe I just didn't pay enough attention to who's actually in charge, but this has been a rough start. The plot isn't that interesting and I really only care about Coulson because I've really had to no reason like the rest. While Fitz and Simmons are cool and dynamic there's nothing spectacular and this show doesn't hold a flame to other shows by Whedon like Firefly or, my favorite, Dollhouse. I'm really hoping things pick up as the season goes along.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Love this book! The last one third of the book is impossible to set down as soon as you've started.  I just wish this wasn't the last book!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|It was such a good series it's sad it has to be over I also cried when tris died it was a very well done series and Veronica Roth did a good job hope she writes more good stories in the future
0739368435|5.0|What a gem of a book. My wife read it first, and to be honest, the title made me not wabt to read it. But I was certainly glad I did.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|i chose it because the actors did a very good job.<br />sigourney did a very good job in all of the movies.<br />i also have other movies she was in.
B00EJX2YGM|3.0|This box set is okay but it has way too many special features to keep count, which might be fustrating for some people. Anyways all i care about is the movies. Time to let go and get on with your lives.

B00BSB2AE4|5.0|As soon as I knew the book was out there for me to buy, I had to have it. I have read Allie's stories and adored her drawings for years. If you are a fan of her work, the book does not disappoint. New stories! Yay! She is simply hilarious and makes me want to draw my own weird stories of my own weird life. Love her!!!
B00004TJKI|5.0|I just reviewed The Paperboy and that makes a modern contrast in style and content.<br />The acting line up in terms of stars and future stars is similar and<br />it is about a man accused of murder as well.<br />There the similarity ends as one is a 50's classic that should be mentioned with To Kill a Mochingbird<br />for the art of motion picture making and the other as a complete failure<br />of writers and actors in The Paperboy. As impressive as the cast is with a bit part by Duke Ellington,<br />even the sleepy slow judge is a master piece of characterization in this move.<br />It is maybe the sense of irony and affirmation this film parts with that is the best touch?
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|DiCaprio is always good and does Gatsby quite well, I was thrown off by actress who played Daisy - not appealing.  The surrealistic settings were distracting
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Many people could ( and I  am sure have) benefit from information and ideas in this book.  I have found myself giving advice because of ideas given in case studies.
1449305172|5.0|This is the first amazon review I've ever written and I've bought and read hundreds of books over the years.<br />I felt compelled to write something as this book has changed my business life.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|entertaining and fun.cool sounds and neat graphics. it never gets old! I enjoy playing this game which is both thought provoking but simple at the same time.
0783225903|1.0|Only bought this movie for a film analysis class...needed an energy drink just to get through the film. The film deals with fantasy and imagination, but was hard to follow.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|Susan, as always, sings from her heart and soul.  She touches you with her remarkable voice, and how blessed we are that she shares that with the world.  Yes, it is another Christmas album, but each song seems as if I have heard it for the first time.  Susan truly feels every song she sings, and the duets with Elvis Presley and Johnny Mathis make it perfect.<br />What a wonderful way to enjoy the magic of the holidays, and every day!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Spent years reading these books I'm very happy and very sad I've finished them :/ the greatest series I've ever read an probably ever will.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game, but was getting tired of only being able to play on my phone or a computer.  Glad they finally made the app compatible with the Kindle!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing an  wonderful. You my not get cause of your device. So don't hate the game hate the device. ; )
B00BEIYMAG|3.0|The Conjuring isn't nearly as good as it should be. Like Insidious, it is highly derivative of horror movies past. That was what made Insidious fun - getting the visual references to so many old horror movies. The Conjuring is merely tiresome, even if it is &#34;based&#34; on a true story. We've seen it before and done better. If the screenwriters and director had gone for more originality, less &#34;over-the-top&#34; theatrics and more subtle menace, it might have become a true classic of horror. Speaking of the script - it starts out well enough but my the third act it becomes overly active including an unnecessary detour to a Warren family crisis which didn't add anything to the story. The few short scenes didn't detract from the momentum, but they only added confusion to an already hyperactive script when the film should have raced straight toward the conclusion. The cast is good, particularly John Brotherton as Office Brad - watch his body language as a typical early 70s macho stud becoming unnerved by a creaking rocking chair. All in all, not great and not bad. You might want to rent or otherwise view before you buy - or wait six months till it retails for 8 bucks. I won't be rewatching my 16.99 purchase anytime soon.

B00FPH6M82|1.0|SLOW,SLOW,SLOW...insufficient reliance on poor acting by his real life son. SAW all the poor reviews and decided to waste the money on watching it cause there was nothing new on...it didn't disappoint me. IT WAS LAME!...proves that your name can put together a LAME STORY LINE, SLOW, OBVIOUS PROGRESSION to &#34;MANHOOD&#34; by a BOY who's dad teeters in and out of reality from a scratch gone bad...THIS GUY IS A GOD to everyone and get's taken down by a wound and has to rely on his son to save EVERYONE?...let alone HIMSELF and HIS DAD?...I think next time I see Wil Smith advertising a SCI-FY movie I'll wait until it comes out on the Amazon &#34;FREE SIDE&#34;...and even then I may ask for SOME SORT of monetary compensation for wasting my time YET AGAIN!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Why bother I don't have enough to say to meet the minimum, which is sad.  And they'll reject it because I just pad it out add in more words, like a 2nd grade essay.
0804137501|5.0|Have you ever wished you didn't have to commute to work (1 hour each way) every day? 5 days a week? 50 weeks a year?<br /><br />\\"the verdict is in: long commutes make you fat, stressed, and miserable. Even short commutes stab at your happiness.\\" - Remote, Office Not Required<br /><br />I finished this book in one sitting: couldn't put it down. Jason and David expose why we *shouldn't* need to commute to the office every day - and they show us a better way. Based on their experience at 37signals, the duo explain why remote working makes more sense for this generation.<br /><br />It's also refreshing to have the boys at 37signals talk about the downsides to remote work. It brings a sense of balance, and realism, to the book. They mention a few very real negatives to working outside of the corporate office; but they also provide tips for circumventing those challenges.<br /><br />My guess is that most employees would jump at the chance to work remotely, if the opportunity was given to them. You don't need to convince them.<br /><br />It's bosses that need the convincing. They're the target that I hope read this book. David and Jason do a good job of describing how remote work can help a company, and its people, thrive. They show that it's not just \\"for 37signals\\" - it can work beautifully at any company, regardless of size.<br /><br />The employees are already on board; the question is if more teams will offer remote work as an option. I'm hoping Remote: Office Not Required changes that.
0385537131|5.0|I always await a new novel by the beloved author, John Grisham. This one had me crying at the end.  The novel was moving and told with that wonderful way he allows the story to unfold. The pacing and characters were exceptional. I saw an interview recently with the author, who stated that A Time to Kill was his favorite, as it is also mine. He took the issues head on in this book that begins where his first novel left off, a few years later. This novel rivals his first - it might be difficult to choose my favorite now. Highly recommended!
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Loved every minute of this movie. The perfect family story!!! The colors are stunning and the graphics actually compliment the caveman look!! Loved it. I hardly watch a movie twice but this one could make it to 5!!!
B00FWLDHSY|5.0|Gripping ...Must see, keeps you glued to viewing the whole movie to the end. No breaks or pauses even for drinks, snacks or well you can just imagine the you know where!
B00FEHXCIG|5.0|No gadgets, a little cliché here and there with the dialogues between Tony Stark and the kid. Great movie overall and Pipper getting some muscle action... Why did she ever get &#34;fixed&#34; she could have had her own story!!!
1476727651|3.0|I'm not done with the book. It is very good so far, as all his books are! Frankly I was very disappointed with my purchase, It arrived slower than I expected, and then when I opened the package, the book jacket, (back portion) was torn ragged and sent anyway. I have repaired it with scotch tape, so it is in one piece, but It certainly made me very upset that it was sent in this manner. The jacket is very important (to me anyway).  The damaged jacket did a lot to ruin the 'read' because each time I handle this new book, I have to rehash the ripped cover.  It took more than 10 days for it to be delivered as well. On the whole, the transaction was very upsetting. The purchase was made with the residue of a birthday gift from my daughter.  I know I am making a ''big deal'' out of it. but it WAS to me.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Like the show, it held my interest and was both enjoyable and humorous. Sorry to hear the TV show was cancelled.

B00B89LZ4C|5.0|The likeness of Bryan Cranston as Heisenberg is excellent and all the items that are included such as the bag full of money make this a terrific item.  I gave it as a gift to a big fan of the show and he loves it!

B00881VLCE|1.0|I enjoyed putting the puzzles together but everytime I tried opening the app I had a hard time. I also then realiized I would have to buy more after I finished with the few given.
1401233791|5.0|I love Batman comics so of course I wanted this comic!:D It's great I haven't been able to finish it yet but if you're a fan of &#34;classics&#34; I'd definately reccommend it!:) Speedy delivery as well!(:
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This program just keeps getting better.  The plot remains intricate, and the writers continue to make sure that you don't know who to trust. Great acting by everyone.  Definitely habit-forming.  You can't watch just one.
1451666179|5.0|I am a long time fan, but that doesn't matter. All that matters is that you read this book and that you read it right away.  And then go read the award-winning blog. And then go read her Gloss articles. And then tell me you've ever read anything more insightful that made you laugh until you cried and back again. And THEN tell me you're not going to quote the part about the vacuum in the parrot chapter to all of your friends, because I totally have.
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|THIS WAS GREAT, JUST LIKE ALL OF LEE CHILD'S  JACK REACHER NOVELS!!!!  I AM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT ONE.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If you liked &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; you'll love<br />&#34;Sycamore Row&#34;. Spending time with the characters I fell in love with years ago was a highlight of this book. I couldn't put it down until I'd read the last page. A great read! John Grisham has done it again.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The book is somewhat cumbersome with a split narrative. Ultimately it offers a satisfying conclusion without feeling like things are left unresolved. Fun read!
B003UYUP58|4.0|A great history of cancer and medical cancer treatments.  I was disappointed that it didn't include other more holistic forms of treatment.  For instance, it didn't mention nutrition or any cancer research pertaining to nutrition.  Aside from that, it provides a deep understanding of how difficult it is to come up with a medical solution and at the same time gives some glimmer of hope.
B00FJU1HLC|4.0|Very enjoyable and a great family story. My son (9) only gives this 4 stars because he feels there could have been a little more adventure.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|overall a good hidden game. hard to find objects in certain rooms. objects found by mistake. enjoy the zoom feature
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This should be taught to every person from the time they are born.  It should replace some of the required curriculum in school.  This is life 101!  The world would benefit greatly.
0316055433|5.0|It's almost 800 pages and one would ask \\"do I have the time to read it\\"?  But once you dive into the mountain of densely rich pages, you will ask \\"is this task at hand worth keeping me away from \\"The Goldfinch\\"?  Donna Tartt's book will take you on a journey in vivid detail by placing you among a diverse cast of characters as Theo Decker - a boy who loses his beloved Mother to a terrorist bombing searches for meaning of truth as he tries to define the sorrow, despair, struggle, and path of his life. All the time his acquired 17th century Dutch painting of the Goldfinch accompanies him. The parallel between the work of art and Theo's journey is cleverly composed. Some reviewers state that the author goes a bit far with the details, but I believe she could write about paint drying and make it interesting.  This book is the work of a master, and will surely be read & studied by generations to come. If you hunger for fine American Literature, then this book is the best buffet in town.
B00CM6ZLG8|5.0|hands down the best album she made so far. He songs fit her age and her age group so there aren't any &#34;kiddie songs&#34; Her last album was good and I really enjoyed, but this one tops it. And the lyrics are excellent.  Every song is great
B0049J2CKE|5.0|Adorable, feel good story...plus cooking - in Paris...what's not to love? I mean, does it really get any better?? :)
B0038ZITIE|5.0|A glorioius 1970´s movie-!!!  The gay content is SO powerfull, and SO obvious now in 2013.  It makes me giggle that straight men could see this in 1970-something and NOT realize the strong gay content.  Hawkmen-?!  LOL  Fabulous film; too bad there was not a sequel that I know of .
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I've gotten to love the characters in the Divergent series, this book, even more!! It was fun hearing & reading Tobias' POV, is fun!!! I think the immersion reading helped make that part much better!! I do have to say, I was NOT a fan of the ending! I'm going to try not to spoil, so it's just not a typical ending.it seemed short, but that could very well be that I couldn't put it down!!!!
B0063B2BNE|5.0|I love all the seasons of Bones. It is a very cute show, I will watch it until it is done.
006202406X|1.0|Disappointment of the year award goes to Allegiant.  If I could, I would return this book.  Tip of the day, if you have to explain your book on your blog and on mtv, you probably didn't do your job as an author.  But, that's just my opinion.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|I had loved the idea of this when I saw the reviews.. finally got to watch it and it was very cute-love love loved it!

B00579EL18|3.0|From the cast list, it seems clear that Corelli's Carlo is the draw here. The best parts of his performances of this opera were always the two scenes with Elisabetta. Here, the music in these is so brutally cut that there is a disappointment around every corner. Some of Corelli's best sections are just not there, making it necessary to seek another performance to supply them. The listening becomes too frustrating to be enjoyable. Why choose these wonderful scenes to do such insensitive cutting? The Met should have issued a warning, considering how few people would buy this set for any reason other than the tenor.

0486268659|5.0|Thank you! It was very quickly. I like the speed. I want your shop will be better than now, I like it.

B001P9KR8U|4.0|I rented this film about about 2 years ago from Netflix, after I heard so many good things about it and I was not disappointed. And even though it was Shah Rukh Khan who is the reason I recently became interested Hindi films after watching My Name is Khan recently (which to me is one of the best Indian films ever made if not one of the best movies i have ever seen), I did enjoy Slumdog film which is one of the few or first Indian films I have seen. Very we'll made and interesting story.
0756686970|4.0|This was a great introduction to the Star Wars world.  And what a way to do then through Legos.<br />Good job!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|Not! Not! A favorite, I don't believe I would recommend this book to an everyday blue-collar worker nor a person that has a spiritual relationship w/God.  However,I understand there is a section to the book,Afterword, that directs the focus to God.  If so this is good, in fact it could be the best part and worthy of recommending the book to believers of God.&#34;
1449305172|5.0|I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn about the Lean methodology. Ash did a great job at explaining the key elements of the methodology while keeping it very practical and full of examples. Also remember that the best approach is to apply what you're learning to a real use case. So get started now!
0062255657|2.0|What a let down. Neil is so much better than this. I you're into easy-to-read childish prose (adult book?) than this is the book for you. I'm so disappointed at the level of craftsmanship from a master craftsman.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Not really a reader, but I couldn't stop turning the pages. Loved it all! Can't wait to continue onto the next book
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|So Smooth and flawlessly written You can almost  feel the humidity and hear the old ceiling fans .<br />It flows, and Gives  You Wonderful visuals. Court-room drama that I didn't find at all boring<br />as it continued to paint a accurate picture of how it was in the day.I was Mesmerized.
B00BSZZA3I|1.0|Terrible. It did not fit the phone properly, even though the phone type is correct. Disposed of it the next day. A total waste.
B00AE2J5HI|5.0|Loved this movie and it kept you interested throughout the movie. Would watch it again and again. You will not be disappointed in the movie.
B0046ECFRM|2.0|Anna and the French Kiss was the book I read to make up for Just One Day… well that obviously failed.<br /><br />I wanted another cute, romantic, Paris book. Anna and the French Kiss did start off kind of cute, but after the half-way point, it tanked hard. I could not finish this book fast enough. In the last quarter in particular I was whipping through those pages because I just wanted it to end!<br /><br />Honestly, I don’t even have enough desire or energy to talk about “the good” in this book, so I’m only going to talk about the bad.<br /><br />Anna.<br /><br />I didn’t mind Anna at first. I didn’t start to dislike her at all until the second half of the book. I hated her when she expected &Eacute;tienne to leave his girlfriend for her. I hated her when she went out with another guy as a “rebound”. I hated that she did things with that other guy (Dave) that she didn’t want to do, and she probably just did them to make &Eacute;tienne jealous. I hated when she got drunk and acted like a complete and total b**ch. Also, this paragraph makes her sound totally lame:<br /><br />&#34;Why have I never drunk before? I was such an idiot—it’s not a big deal. I totally understand why people drink now. I’m not sure what I’ve been drinking, but I do know it was something fruity. It started out disgusting, but the more I drank, the better it got. Or the less I noticed it. Something like that. Man, I feel weird. Powerful.&#34;<br /><br />Maybe it’s just because I’m not a party girl, but I thought that was a pathetic sounding paragraph.<br /><br />But I really started to hate Anna when she let &Eacute;tienne cheat on his girlfriend with her (and that’s also when I started hating &Eacute;tienne). Cheating isn’t suddenly “okay” just because the guy is doing it to be with the main character. I don’t care if the MC is the one benefitting.. cheating is still horrible and quite frankly, I don’t want to read about it. Cheating is a quick and easy way to make me hate any book, and this was no exception.<br /><br />Then, that was followed up with another doozy. I still don’t understand this..<br /><br />Amanda (the stuck up, queen bee b**ch of the school) spends the whole year making fun of Anna here and there. She calls Anna a skunk (because of her hair style), a slut, and just throws in insults all the time. But what pushed Anna to the edge was when Amanda called Anna’s best friend a dyke (to Anna, not to the friend). Anna got pissed and kind of tackled/hit Amanda. When they got called into the principal’s office, Anna refused to tell the principal what Amanda said that provoked her… WHY? Well, apparently because:<br /><br />&#34;The detention was divided unfairly because I refused to tell her what Amanda said. Because I hate that word. Like being gay is something to be ashamed of.&#34;<br /><br />You hate the word so you refuse to tell the principal when someone uses the word in a derogatory way? WHERE IS THE LOGIC HERE??? Amanda was a freaking b**ch using derogatory words and you just let her get away with it because you “hate that word”. What the hell??? I literally feel like there’s no logic here, and it’s still bugging me even after finishing the book.<br /><br />So as a result of Anna’s silence, Anna got two weeks of detention and Amanda got like nothing. Nice one, Anna. I hope you feel like you’ve accomplished something.<br /><br />Then after this point, Anna continued to annoy me with her “OMG &Eacute;tienne hates me” attitude, when he so obviously liked her. It was painful. Everyone knew &Eacute;tienne liked Anna, despite the fact that he refused to break up with his girlfriend (which was also annoying).. but Anna went around moping and crying about how he hates her and doesn’t want to talk to her—boo hoo.<br /><br />And &Eacute;tienne annoyed me too.  He had a girlfriend, but he spent all his time with Anna.  All his thoughts were about Anna.  He was clearly into Anna... and yet he wouldn't break up with his girlfriend because he &#34;doesn't want to be alone&#34;.  That's horrible.<br /><br />Towards the end it was just pathetic high school drama that made me want to finish the book as quickly as possible.girlfriend because he &#34;doesn't want to be alone&#34;.  That's horrible.<br /><br />Towards the end it was just pathetic high school drama that made me want to finish the book as quickly as possible.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Some of his latest novels have been good but with Dr. Sleep, King brings back memories for me of reading his great ones (IT, The Stand, The Shining, etc). Great read.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Different style of course, but what a fun read! Loved the story and the style it was written. Another great book from Stephen king.
B009LDCXNY|5.0|This season has been a beautiful but soul-crushing journey. (&#34;Loved it&#34; would be an understatement.) The purgatory story-line was magnificent - The only let-down was that there should have been more of it! And I'm so thankful that Jeremy Carver has brought back the epic mythology of seasons 4 and 5, making it one of the best seasons.<br />I would give it a 1,000,000 star rating if that was possible. ;)
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Incredible book, truly.  I had high expectations, which usually leads to disappointment.  That did not happen here.  A fantastic read, start to finish.  Enjoy.
159562015X|4.0|This book is based on Gallup assessment tool and the online questionnaires are adequately designed. The report generated helped guide me on how best I can utilize my strength. A book that I would highly recommend for sure!
B00FAX6XQC|1.0|it wont load. took me 5hours to install it and now that I finally have it I cant play it. I have to reinstall it which will take another 5 hours.. don't get this game
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|These silly games usually annoy me, but I am now on level 147.  I'm hooked.  You can buy the extras to help you thru the difficulties, but you don't have to.  You will get thru them.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Very sensitive and touching!!! Book is sad yet very truthful and exposes mental illness to the reader in a thought provoking way!
0385737955|4.0|like my title says, this book was slow at first. i think that's mainly because dashner spent a great deal of time trying to build up the setting. at some point, the book definitely picked up and i found it hard to put it down. i found the lingo that the characters spoke with a little annoying but i guess that's the author's way of dodging using curse words in a young adult's book. overall, the whole concept of this world really intrigues me. this book didn't offer much background in terms of that, but i'm looking forward to the subsequent books to learn more about WICKED and the flare.
B00DPH7QFM|5.0|Blackmore at his best!!!!!  Looks like he is happy too. Just to hear him play burn makes this DVD a must.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Is ridiculous to sell a product without apps.DON'T BUY this until GOOGLE put more apps in the market. There are only few apps
1449305172|5.0|An excellent book that really dives into the practicalities of using the techniques which are only mentioned in other books.
B00881VLCE|4.0|i really enjoy this puzzle game but it often freezes and closes. it would do it occasionally with the free version, then when i bought the ad free version and did the update it was much worse. i had to uninstall and reinstall twice since it wouldn't run at all. now works but still occasionally freezes and closes. great game other than that
B006UKFFE0|5.0|After you find out about Lean Startup, MVPs, Pivots, read Ash's book to find out more about how exactly to do it.<br />Practical information such as the Lean Canvas, how to structure interviews, experiments, MVPs and more bring this exciting concept down to earth.<br />I still find myself referring to specific sections when trying to iterate through a lean startup process.
B00FWLDHSY|4.0|Watched this last night... it was a good sci-fi movie and was never lacking in action.  Fast paced and monsters getting their ass whooped.  It was late and i had intentions of watching half the movie, going to bed then watch the other half the next day.  That didnt happen!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love that I can now play this on a larger screen than my Android phone! This game is addictive so beware!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Turn your dumb tv into a smartTV.  But it will be better when it has more apps.  Right now it has Netflix and YouTube.  The cool thing is that once you get a show or movie going, you can pause it right from your phone.  The APP is in the ChromeCast, not your phone, but if they are on the same home network, you can control it.  The Beta cast from Chrome works, but with some delay.  Great for the money especially if you're a Netflix person.
B00BSBVJVE|5.0|This tells of the adventures of Pusheen the cat as well as tips for cat owners and potential cat owners.<br /><br />This is a quick, cute, hilarious read.<br /><br />The drawings are fun and adorable.  Humor filled tag lines adorn and help explain the drawings.<br /><br />Overall, a fun read!
B004W25KKW|5.0|An insightful read, it explains a lot of the working of the brain that helped me.<br />Everybody should read this book at least once.
B006O6F932|5.0|Excellent quality, on-time delivery, fulfilled all my expectations of price and quality and the service very good, really excellent, very good
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|I was nervous at first.<br /><br />When &#34;seasoned&#34; performers come out with new material I'm not typically a fan - lets face it, the music that got us into them was saturated with the emotions and struggles of youth whether it be love, friendship or financial strife. When artists become famous and successful, they lose that turbulent river of emotion; the songs, although performed flawlessly, sound forced. The most recent example that comes to mind was &#34;Long Road out of Eden&#34; by the Eagles - horrible album, and I love the Eagles.<br /><br />This album does not disappoint! every track is great, from start to finish, I can just listen to it all the way through. It's not the Beatles, it's not Wings, it's Paul - good writing, good music, and good production. It sounds like honest new material, not just some songs he stored away for a rainy day.<br /><br />Wish I could give it six stars.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Honestly this is the greatest game I have EVER played for my Kindle Fire. The multiplayer is just incredible. Better than COD for DS

1476727651|4.0|I was in high school when THE SHINING came out in the late 70's.  I read it just before Stanley Kubrick's film was released in the summer of 1980, and I was a huge fan of SALEM'S LOT, THE DEAD ZONE and PET SEMATERY.  But after I read CHRISTINE, a very long book about a killer car, I drifted away somewhat and stopped reading him.<br /><br />Stephen King was and is a great writer.  Anyone who ever thinks of writing should read his book, ON WRITING.  This month, another remake of CARRIE was just released in theaters.  \\"Under the Dome\\" is on television.  Although he personally detests the Kubrick film, it's still being screened all over the place this Halloween while ROOM 237, an off-beat documentary about all the conspiracies seen in the film, was released on DVD.  King's mark and legacy on the culture are assured.<br /><br />And, also, comes King's official sequel to THE SHINING called DOCTOR SLEEP.  Sequel to the book, not the film (the Overlook Hotel did not survive--physically--in the novel).<br /><br />It's a fun read, a skillful sweep that finds Danny Torrance as an alcoholic hitting depths in reality worse than his father had in the first novel, then getting involved with another child who whose \\"shine\\" is much more powerful than his ever was...and more valuable.<br /><br />The villains this time is a gypsy-like group of psychic vampires who seek out mostly children with \\"the shining\\" and sacrifice/absorb them in a weird pagan-ish ritual.  The evil of the Overlook Hotel is a dim memory and distant presence, so I wasn't as enthralled by the story as I was hoping to be since Danny is fighting them to save a little girl.  It's not so much a sequel but a character from one book wandering into a whole other book, if that makes sense.<br /><br />But I'm quibbling.  It was a fun read and I'm grateful to Mr. King for letting us know what happened to little Danny.<br /><br />It was such an awful business up that the hotel in Colorado.
B00E7Z7D2M|5.0|First review, just sayin.... Anyways this album is bonkers. Big Ups Robert. And for real, I edit videos all day everyday, holla at ya boy if you need some film work, least I could do[humbledown (dot) com]. The first album was great. This one is winning awards as well, nothing else in the market is musically pleasing. Some other albums have a couple tracks here and there, this whole cd is a banger. Play it when you with the homies.. Play it when you in the park with the kids. Let it play low, when you with the lady. Play it while you dream big dreams. I'm saying, Dave Chappelle plays it while he writes his next movie...<br /><br />So, on a real level, Macy Gray, Jean Grae and Brandy...All on one cd... Then Common, Snoop, Lupe...Jill Scott, Lalah Hathaway and Faith Evans...Do I have to go on? Hell yeah...Norah Jones, Bilal, Anthony Hamilton, Dwele...And for real to top it off...Malcolm Jamal Warner (the coolest Theo Huxtable), Wayne Brady (I'm Wayne Brady b**ch)...Need I say more?<br /><br />Yes I will-- Robert and his guys are all trained at the highest level, could teach themselves, instead have chosen to share their gift with the the world....<br /><br />Get this album you won't regret it...<br /><br />-Purple Rain
B003IY47JK|5.0|Delain was started as a band using many know signers and guest musicians.  Martijn decided that Delain could be more than that and together with Charlotte created a very creative band.  Using singers like Marco Hietala from Nightwish and Sharon den Adel from Within Temptation they created their own sound causing a large following in Europe.  Delain has becomes a favorite in the US as well as concerts are booked solid and concert goers are every familiar with their songs.  Their first album, Lucidity, is a compilation some of their early but yet creative songs and  musical ability.  Charlotte voice ranges from angelic to full on metal.  The arrangement of guitar, bass and keyboards work in harmony to produce their own unique sounds.  I enjoy listening to their music and will complete my collection to include their albums April Rain and We are the Others,  Am looking forward to their next new album.  I am a fan and hope to see them in the US soon.
B00EE3FTNM|4.0|Purchased to watch online since our cable video on demand no longer had this episode.  Loved the show and continued to watch the entire season.
B0010SKUYM|2.0|Slow character development. Took way too long for the story to unfold. I just could not get into it. For me it did not live up to the other reviews.
B00CQRN3QI|5.0|It is a wonderful classic Disney movie. It is just as wonderful as I remember it being as a child.
B001XVD2Z0|3.0|When this movie came out it seemed revolutionary in effects and storyline...watching it again at the age of 27 just made me laugh at the bad acting and overall silliness of it all. I can't believe I thought the plot was so complex, but hey I originally saw this when I was 14. So three stars for nostalgia, but if you are not a teenager, you mind bad acting, and don't like cheesy lines you might like it.
B0098VXDDS|4.0|It's good, but took a little getting use to with the replacement Actor for Spartacus, but story line is uninterrupted.
B00ANAC32U|5.0|This is by far the best looking and functioning bumper cover you can get for the Google Nexus 4.  I highly recommend it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|A simple, reasonably priced device that'll allow me to watch my Kindle on the big screen.  Look forward viewing a good selection.

B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I love the chemistry between Castle and Beckett. Throw in some comedy and crime and it becomes a very addicting show.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|It took me a little while to get into this book.  Once you learn the characters and see how they all fit together, you get sucked in.  There are unexpected twists in this story that keep you hooked!
0399243860|5.0|Not what I expected at first, you match the colors to the pictures. I do really like it tho and will buy the others.

B0055ANHBY|2.0|We found the pieces to be entirely too small for a beginner. we bought this for our 6 year old and my husband ended up doing all the work. wish there were age recommedations
B0033H7VI6|3.0|Was wanting a good camp knife to replace one that was lost. The fit and finish were not great. Uneven grind, the handles don't line up to the tang which could cause blisters etc. I like the feel of the grip and the heft but the first time out the blade chipped. I was chopping some very small diameter green wood. Unacceptable in my opinion. It will be my beater camp knife until it gets to bunged up and for the price i should have known but read some great reviews.
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Seen this a couple of times and decided to go ahead and buy the 3-d version to watch with friends.  Such a beautiful movie.  We bought the extra 3-d glasses for our Panasonic so we can have 4 people watch with us.  Nice that the playstation does 3-d.  When we upgraded our tv, we didn't have to buy a new 3-d player.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have mixed emotions about this book. A love/hate relationship! I love Christian when he's being a simple man. But I hate that he turns into this not so loving person. Ana is annoying sometimes. But other than that I like the story line of the book so far!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Have to be more patient as apps get compatible with the device,<br /><br />DNS hardcoded into device so won't get netflix unless they let you.
1490313370|4.0|As a self-starter and entrepreneur, I love real entrepreneurial stories about success and failure, and the lessons learned along the way to ultimate success. James Altucher's book, Choose Yourself, reminds us over and again, that we are the ones we've been waiting for.  And, no we're not perfect and no our entrepreneurial endeavors will not always be perfect or even succeed, but investing in yourself and giving yourself permission and a chance to try is always worth it.  I would rather live with the regret of a failed endeavor than the regret of never trying and giving it my best shot and that message is reinforced over and again in Choose Yourself.<br /><br />James Altucher speaks from the heart and funny bone, and will have you laughing and cheering and rising up to meet your fears, demons, and triumphant self...all while having fun unleashing your creative self from the dungeon of abandoned dreams.<br /><br />I agree with the 5 stars for this book, and only bumped it down to 4 stars because I'm not a fan of the use of expletives.  However, I AM a fan of being real, authentic, innovative, enterprising, and sharing what you know and that's what James has done in this book, Choose Yourself.<br /><br />If you are an entrepreneur or want to be, if you love business, and/or if you need some inspiration and chuckles and reminders of what's possible, read it...you will be glad!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|The divergent series was great, one of my favorites I've read. I was so excited for the last book and the movies. I was so disappointed!!! I hate investing in a series only to be let down at the end. If I had know what would have happened I wouldn't have read the series. Still, it was  well written, I just didn't like what she wrote.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It was so boring I fought to get through it& I'm a huge fan of the first 2 books. This book was a waste of time&  horrible. She filled it with nonsense to fill the pages. Lost me after they went to the Bureau. This was the most boring and worst book I ever read & I've read some lame and boring books in my lifetime. Veronica was beginning to become a favorite author of mine now I won't go out of my way to find her books and definitely wish I never preordered this one. If I didn't like the first 2 books so much I would definitely return this for a full refund!!!!!!!
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I was skeptic about this app,however I was impress when I tried it. Easy to use, I am satisfied. I don't youtube much tough.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Love the book but the ending was just so sad.. it's a different type instead of regular love book but still you can't help but wish it would have been different.
B002GSXKN8|5.0|Yay for Burton! Four movies in one package is always good news, right?  I was not disappointed at all with this purchase.
B001G70M6S|5.0|Film was well within date code and arrived in good condition. This film works great in Polaroid Land film cameras like the 100, 250, etc. With 3000 speed it is much easier to take pictures in low light levels than with the FP-100, and it has a faster development time. Very sharp, high contrast film.
B00943SQCI|5.0|I tried to watch an episode of the original Dark Shadows, but was bored to death from it. But, I couldn't care less about Burton's reason for his film adaptation, this is simply a fun movie, particularly for Halloween!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|this app is by far my favorote this and blood and glory yeah it is so cool cool cool cool
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Cute game. I love playing,but do wish the game would sync with different devices. I started playing on my Kindle and when I got a Samsung, I had to start a whole new game.
B00F8OUBXE|5.0|I love this album. It's exactly what you hope for as a fan and more. Kurdt Vanderhoof's signature riffs are all over this material and Ronny Munroe finally sounds as killer in the studio as he does live. There is zero filler on this album. It's got a lot of great songs to choose from but my favorite by far is the haunting \\"Noises in the wall\\" which is too killer to try to explain but you just have to hear it for yourself. You can literally hear the walls moaning in the track! Let me also say that if you're into killer bass, Steve Unger does not disappoint here. My friend Metal Jim told me to trust him and get this cd and man was he right! I can't wait to hear this stuff live too. This album can easily stand up next to any of the band's previous material and hold it's own. Buy it or you're missing out on something very special.
B003B02O14|5.0|A good read.  John Grisham writes well and I enjoy all of his novels.  Recommend this book for those who enjoy good stories about lawyers and their profession.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Such a fun game and absolutely addictive.  Only problem is the long wait for more lives.  I would play a lot more if lives regenerated faster.
B004LROUNG|5.0|A good read.  John Grisham writes well and I enjoy all of his novels.  Recommend this book to those who enjoy stories about lawyers and their profession.
B00CMYRSQG|5.0|I'll admit.  It did take a couple of listens to get used to this album.  Its obvious they tried a few different things on this album compared to previous albums, which is understand able if you're a constant progressing musician.  All in all a very good album.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|\\"STAR TREK: INTO DARKNESS\\" -<br />review by James S. Cameron. (No, not 'that' James Cameron!)<br /><br />I went into this movie with some sense of unease, as I did with the last film with the new Star Trek cast. OK, it was more like \\"fear\\"; FEAR! (There, I said it!) The last movie, (the first film with the new version of the old cast of original characters)(?), the reason behind my fear was rather obvious, I think. I thought that the movie was going to ruin what I held 'somewhat sacred' about the original series with this 'fresh' cast of the old characters, that same \\"dedication feeling\\" which continued developing right through to the first handful of movie adaptations with these beloved 'original' characters that I'd grown up with in them, as well. When I finally managed to watch the last film, & happily, I found it to be much like a slice of pumpkin pie at Thanksgiving to me. So my fears were phasered right into black-hole oblivion. (There's 'got' to be an easier, or at least more 'condensed' way of describing, differentiating between, the various Star Trek casts, here!) (Hmm)<br /><br />So you'd think that now, 3 years later, and myself having been so adequately reassured by that first movie, that I'd be able to go into 'this one' with a sense of ease and comfort... but noooo; it happened again. My reasoning this time, was that maybe the first film with the new cast had just been a fluke, and that the characters might suddenly turn into the cardboard-cut-out-cast with some badly-tailored hacked-up rag-of-a-script that I'd so expected, and dreaded, for the first film.  (I know, I know.. where's my faith!? Where's my Trekkie dedication? I've been humbled.) Well, I'm happy to report that I found this movie to be one of the best Star Trek..., hmm,.. make that best 'science fiction',.. hell,.. I'll just go ahead and go for broke, and put it in the \\"one of my favorite movies of all time!\\" category. (This might, however, just be a psychological ploy on myself, trying toprepare me for the \\"next\\", 3rd installment with the new Star Trek cast. Hmm. I don't know.. You think I'll fool myself? Yeah, you can do it James. Thanks. No problem..)  (!??!)<br /><br />*Disclaimer:  I'm sure, if you're reading this thus far, you have this picture, of some major Trekkie/fan, some burnt social-reject from the late 60's, sucked into my imaginary fantasy Star Trek world, that attends Star Trek conventions, collects memorabilia, reads Star Trek paperbacks, breathes Star Trek.. LIVES Star Trek, etc., in your head. I'm really nothing of the sort, so you can 'mind-meld' that warped little thought right out of your ridged, Klingon-textured cranium. I consider myself a semi-fan, sure,.. but not like a major major one. I think I've only seen every episode of the original show, maybe 3 or 4 times each 'at the most'. (LoL). So yeah, don't EVEN go pigeon-holing me as some sort of Star Trek wacko/nutcase, OK? And like I already mentioned, the movies, after the first 4 or 5 full length features with the original cast, I burned out on them, myself. Yep. I 'did' like the Next Generation show, too, but only saw each episode once, occasionally twice.. some episodes I never even saw at all! (Gasps!) Yep, I KNOW; and as for the other trek spin-off shows, I had no interest in them at all. I'm a 51 year old man, and I proudly tossed my Vulcan ears in the trash during like my junior year in High School, back in early '79. So stick \\"that\\" in your dilythium crystal pipe and smoke it; all you who had already formed the total wrong impression of me! (LMAO)<br /><br />Anyway... Okay, let's just forget about my own personal insecurities, my seemingly-overly-desired needs for Star Trek disassociation, and get right to the pulp of things; shall we? Why did I think this movie was so great? Well, for one, I found myself on the edge of my seat just about the entire film. Never a dull moment for me. Not 'one' single \\"boring\\" scene in the whole movie, in my opinion. I'm sure that not everyone will share my sentiments on that, for we all have different views and opinions, but I truly can only think of maybe a half dozen movies I've seen in my 'lifetime', that have achieved that strong of a grasping of my attention. I have to thank the writers of the film, I suppose, and the editors, along with a great cast of actors as well, for that. I appreciate too, that I think the technological level of the current special effects for science fiction movies such as this one, has finally reached the point to where there were maybe only a couple of scenes where I found myself 'not' believing that the Enterprise was an actual star ship. To where, it's now pretty believable the 'majority' of the time to me, not the 'minority' of the time any more. Surely, it's grown exponentially in believability from the time of the original series' episodes from the late 60's and early 70's. I look back and almost have to laugh at how cheesy some of the \\"space\\" and \\"star ship\\" scenes looked back then.<br /><br />It had all the \\"value-based humanism\\" aspects from the original series that made it so wonderful, too. The morality thang, the power of love and hate - the lifting and devastation of the human spirit. What's more, the inner conflict that was set up within the core characters of the federation, itself, made it all the more compelling for me; right down to the admiral and his daughter conflict. And the Kirk and Spock bro-mance factor, actually had me in tears not just once, but twice in this film (I'll hesitantly admit it). I haven't felt that particular emotional string being tugged since \\"Star Trek II, Wrath of Khan\\", and it only got me once in that flick. This one got me twice!<br /><br />I find the characters of Scotty, McCoy, and Chekov in these latest films to be even stronger than the originals, and that in itself, is saying a whole, whole lot. At first, upon seeing the Khan character portrayed by Benedict Cumberbatch in this film, (and knowing absolutely nothing about the actor), I was thinking.. \\"this\\"? .. 'this' is supposed to be the same character portrayed by the great Ricardo Montelbahn? Just as I was about to go into semi-disgust mode, he started speaking,.. and portraying this new-Kahn character with such assurance and perfection, that I was soon just blown away and forgot all about Ricardo Montelbahn's old character. (Sorry Ricardo, .. God bless your soul.)<br /><br />All in all, I'd give it a maximum number of stars rating without question, as you might have already guessed; and would strongly encourage anyone who ever enjoyed anything 'Trekish' in the past, in any way, shape or form, to \\"yes!\\" See this movie. \\"Own\\" this movie! Put it on the shelf with your classic movies, for it's surely destined to become one. - The END<br /><br />(Oh, and by the way, as far as the next movie goes... Let me just say: \\"I'm ready! Hurry up and release it, already!.. BRING IT ON!\\")<-- (he says loudly, and with the great confidence!) - Sorry, just practicing.  ;o)
B0035HKWLW|5.0|The Dual Charger is great!  I have owned this for about 2 weeks and use it to charge my New Trent PowerPak Xtreme dual charger mainly - it is incredible.  It does the job quickly and without fail.  No doubt a great product.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is good<br />It is fun<br />I like it<br />Yeah!<br />Play this game fun<br />Want more fun game<br />Oh baby!
B00AG6Z92C|5.0|Every song is great! Excellent background music for any activity....for example: cooking, phone calls, having coffee with the girls, etc etc. I even leave this cd playing while I leave the house so when I walk into my house it is on!  It just makes me happy and I might be learning to pronounce a few Italian words...well maybe...of course I don't know what they mean :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game to play. easy. but gets harder as you go. easy to get addicted to playing easily. ready to okay more.

0452273331|5.0|&#34;The Fountainhead&#34; by Ayn Rand is a groundbreaking philosophical novel on the concept of objectivism. Objectivism is the idea of putting yourself in front of others. It is being selfish but selfish is a more blunt definition. Ayn Rand was a heavy supporter of objectivists, and she expressed her views through her books. I would recommend this book to anyone who wishes to expand their knowledge.<br /><br />  &#34;The Fountainhead&#34; is, metaphorically, an immortal book about a man of the name Howard Roark. Roark is an unorthodox, yet brilliant architect who is hated by almost all other architects. Roark is hated by these architects because of several butthurt and superfluous motives. One of these reasons is because Roark only chooses commissions that he wishes to build. These jobs all have one common denominator, this denominator is that the job does not limit Roark's architecture abilities at all, and they allow him to freely construct what he wishes.Many people dislike Roark's buildings, but a handful of people see the true beauty of his buildings. These people are often other objectivists. Together, they are an unstoppable force opposed by the world. How they conquer the world together is too expansive to even begin to describe, because of this, I urge you to read the book.
B00BSB2AE4|5.0|I've been counting down the days for this book to arrive on my Kindle (I pre-ordered it a few months ago).  I was going to try to have some self restraint and wait for tonight, but I could not resist!! If you don't know anything about Allie Brosh or \\"Hyperbole and a Half,\\" please go check out her blog. I would honestly be shocked if you do not come back here and buy her book after reading a few of her posts like \\"Sneaky Hate Spiral\\" and \\"This is Why I'll Never Be an Adult\\".<br /><br />Allie Brosh is smart, honest, and more often than not, hysterically funny.  She honestly shares her childhood memories and has an incredible way of even recalling her childhood rationale.  She writes in a way that makes you feel like she is your best friend regaling her tales of childhood and her extraordinarily, ordinary life events.<br /><br />This book is amazing! Allie included a few stories for her blog, but a lot of new stuff.  She definitely makes up for not posting for a while.<br /><br />Thank you, Allie for writing a book!  If you happen to read this review (highly unlikely, I'm sure), I really wish we could be friends! Please take that in the most un-creepy way possible! :)
B002RUA524|3.0|Not so interested in the stories of insects etc but found the family antics and activities very funny.  This was our monthly book club reading.  I gave it a rating of 5/10
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Deep and delightful, this film shows how aging, despite its losses, can be a time of exploration and connection. Eight somewhat disgruntled British elders make their way to India and become a community in the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Its okay but too hard to get to the next level.  People always asking for lives because they can't move. Somedays I just give all my lives away. I like seeing my family play and share.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I loved this movie!!  great story, great acting and very scary, it had my attention the whole way through, and that is very hard to do.<br />Normally when people say a movie is scary, nine times out of ten, to me its nothing.<br />So if you like horror check out this movie, you wont be disappointed..

B003YL4LYI|1.0|The game of Thrones was an interesting read for the first 500 pages the next 4500 pages were total repitition. Same sub plots repeated over and over and over. I would never recommend this book. I will never waste my time reading another George R.R. Martin book.
B004SIP71M|5.0|And not just because my son is in it.....  :-}  Love the story line and the acting is great!  Can't go wrong with Meryl or Philip!
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|Enjoyed watching the entire season to maintain story-line continuity.  I wish the characters were getting a tad more interesting thou.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|Now have all of it together so can watch start to finish - with no interruptions!  There is sooooo much in the dialogue that flows that you have to watch it again and again......  Too bad we didn't have THIS president running for election!!!!!
B0010VD7EO|5.0|Out of the 10 songs on this album, I have to say I love, not just like, at least 8 or 9 of them.  Track number 2 (Weekend Warriors) is my favorite.  MGMT has a unique sound--almost Beetle like.  Love it!
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|Even tho I got a couple of the illusions, it was greatly entertaining. Loved Mark R and great ending. Just goes to show the best plans sometimes have surprise at the end. Watch this one!
140006922X|5.0|This book mirrors many other books in publication on this subject. A similar book that I recommend is Jesus Interrupted, which wasn't written by a Muslim (but actually says the same thing).
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The book was a good read but I felt like the ending was too abrupt.  A few too many loose ends.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is something unusual I read in recent years.  This book might seemed easy to read but it has do much after thoughts.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great for streaming Netflix.  I look forward to plugins being released for Hulu and other streaming apps. Using my phone and tablet for control works well, and I don't have to worry about line of sight like my universal remote control that I have to fight with for my bluray player.
B004RL9T50|5.0|As I stated before in my review of [[ASIN:B00FJTYDKK The Croods]], Dreamworks' films have always been rather hit-or-miss for me.  While their animation has gotten considerably better over the years, easily on par with Pixar's output, many of their films lack the heart, soul, and charm of Pixar's classics, instead choosing to rely on celebrity voicework and pop-culture humor.  A few of their films in recent years have managed to break out of this mold and put story and characters above cheap gags ([[ASIN:B0047C4KBW How To Train Your Dragon]] and [[ASIN:B00BBQXQFI Rise of the Guardians]] being the best examples), but for every one of these films it seems we have to suffer through another soulless \\"Shrek\\" or \\"Madagascar\\" sequel, or some other lackluster film.  At least we didn't get a \\"Shark Tale\\" sequel, I suppose...<br /><br />\\"Megamind\\" is a different sort of film -- it's still primarily a humorous film, with its share of pop-culture-ish jokes (though mostly drawn from comic books rather than more current media).  But it also has a heart behind its story, and characters that are both well-developed and able to take the classic superhero tropes and stereotypes and turn them on their heads.  And of course, its a LOT of fun.<br /><br />The titular Megamind (voiced by Will Ferrell in a surprisingly clean-mouthed role) is an over-the-top supervillain who delights in his wicked ways, waging war on his lifelong rival Metroman (voiced by Brad Pitt) with the help of his trusty companion Minion (voiced by David Cross).  In a shocking twist, one of his villainous schemes actually works and leaves the city without its hero, and for a time he revels in his victory.  But he soon grows bored, wanting the challenge that constantly fighting a hero provided, and so creates a new superhero named Titan (voiced by Jonah Hill) to pick up where Metroman left off.  But when Titan goes out of control and proves to be even more a villain than even Megamind could hope to be, it falls on Megamind and a sassy TV reporter (voiced by Tina Fey) to set things right.  Will a villain turn out to be the hero a beleaguered city needs?<br /><br />As always, the animation in this film is top-notch.  The look of the film is sleek and stylish, with the sort of over-the-top feeling of classic comic books.  The human characters have their own unique style, without looking like living dolls or ultra-realistic.  When a CGI film tries to make its human characters look photo-realistic, they usually fall just a bit short, resulting in the characters looking creepy or zombie-like (I'm looking at you, \\"Polar Express\\"...).  Some of Dreamworks' earlier films fell into this trap, but \\"Megamind\\" keeps a stylish design that avoids the \\"uncanny valley\\" effect.<br /><br />The characters are what make this film really shine, though.  Megamind isn't just a one-dimensional \\"villain,\\" but a socially awkward being who decides that if he can't fit in, then he'll simply stand out in his own way.  His performance is campy and over-the-top, but purposefully so, reveling in spiky leather costumes and elaborate gadgetry and classic-rock anthems at every appearance.  And ironically, he has a stronger sense of good and evil than many other characters in the film, and provides some of the most heartfelt scenes in the film.  Metroman is comparatively bland, but given that he's pretty much Superman in a different costume that's to be expected, and he does show some surprising depth to his role later on in the film.  Roxanne, the reporter, is a spirited character who provides some delightfully snarky humor throughout the film, while Titan starts off dorky but turns out to be surprisingly creepy and effective as time goes on.<br /><br />This film hits a good balance between Dreamworks' usual humor-driven fare and Pixar's heartfelt storytelling, turning classic superhero tropes on their heads and exploring what makes a villain and what makes a hero.  It's fun, pleasant to look at, and has strong voiceacting that never jars the viewer out of the story with a \\"hey, isn't that so-and-so?\\" moment.  And while I still consider \\"How To Train Your Dragon\\" and \\"Rise of the Guardians\\" to be Dreamworks' best films, \\"Megamind\\" is a close third.  Probably best for kids 8 and up due to action violence and some scary scenes.acting that never jars the viewer out of the story with a \\"hey, isn't that so-and-so?\\" moment.

Dan Brown has the ability to tell an intriguing story that is frightening in its real world applications but keeps you guessing as a \\"Who done it.\\" The book follows the work of the NSA and the complex code breaking technology that is the backbone of the agency. While the book is heavy in technology it is not overly complicated to follow. The book also features a strong female lead character, Susan Fletcher, that is worthy of more stories being written about.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Felt left out while everyone else raved about Candy Crush Saga. It's as awesome and as much fun as I heard it is.
B00G24KKAS|5.0|Enjoy watching on Amazon (no commercials). Maintaining ones sanity in an apocalypse (especially a zombie apocalypse) would be difficult at best.  It's always interesting to see whose going to have the next mental breakdown and it looks like Carol is the one.  I am surprised her character has lasted this long, but who knows, she may recover or it may be her demise.  Good suspense.
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|I loved the final season of Ghost Whisperer. I am a huge fan. I would recommend this to anyone who loves the supernatural.
B002NHIJTW|5.0|When I decided to watch this show earlier this year I had no idea what I was in for it is amazing a true homerun I have seen twilight which I also like but The Vampire Diaries is its own show way different some people try and argue that true blood is better but they are wrong true blood is uninteresting The Vampire Diaries is the best show on television and should be watched more sure there's alcohol, sex, and violence but what do you think draws you in the happiness and kisses no the more interesting stuff does and for everybody who says that Nina Dobrev, Paul Wesley, and Ian Somerhalder can't act are you deaf and blind they are fantastic actors so you all can stop hounding them now I love this show, and I especially love the actors.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|This just gets better with repeat viewings.  Going back through the movie with director's comments is very interesting, but the special shorts on the second disc are surely worth the modest additional cost!
0486274268|5.0|Extremely great purchase - I had this book before when I was younger but had lost it and needed a replacement. Perfect book for those who like drawing animals and need good references in animated poses and get a better understanding of how everything works in motion!
B0074QGGK6|5.0|A great little book for artists to read on occasion to remind about how and where to get and create your art.
0761172726|4.0|Getting used to this calendar as our previous family calendars were in the traditional grid display.  This has a vertical display which takes a bit of getting used to, but works well.<br /><br />This calendar has room for Mom (and/or Dad) plus four kids.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|A great little alarm and stopwatch app with lots of options, including starting up to streaming music. I use it all the time.
B0012GMWCA|4.0|Good CD.  Meets expectations.  I think Bruce would have been better of to take the best songs from this CD and Human Touch and make one great CD rather than two good CD's.<br /><br />Up to the normal high standards of Bruce Springsteen, but not one of his best.
0143038583|5.0|There are many fine reviews of THE OMNIVORE'S DILEMMA on Amazon.com. There is also an excellent Wikipedia page on TOD, which summarizes Michael Pollan's discoveries as he investigates how a single meal is produced in three American food chains--industrial (McDonald's), organic industrial (Whole Foods), and organic pastoral (an enlightened local farmer)--as well as how a foodie meal is gathered and prepared near Berkeley within self-imposed hunting/foraging restrictions.<br /><br />There is some amazing stuff in this book. These include: the effects of a hide-the-true-costs government policy and the role of corn in industrial food; the tendency of the organic industrial food chain to overpromise, as well as its undeniable positive impact on the environment; and the commitment required to both raise and routinely purchase organic pastoral food. I also enjoyed Pollan's section on preparing a meal sourced through hunting and foraging, since this enables him to address the ethical concerns of vegetarians and vegans, as well as to convey the panic of any host/hostess who begins his/her dinner party with an overly ambitious menu.<br /><br />This is a nothing-to-add review, written only to help me remember my reactions if TOD ever arises in conversation during dinner, when a foodie friend duplicates Pollan's home cooking and serves fava bean toasts, Sonoma boar pate, Power Fire morels, grilled loin of wild Sonoma pig, wild East Bay yeast levain...<br /><br />And since I'm adding nothing, I also refer to David Kamp's review of TOD, which appeared in the Sunday Book Review of \\"The New York Times\\" in April 2006. There, Kamp says: \\"... if I have any caveats... it's Pollan's tendency to be too nice.... Likewise, I wish Pollan would stick his neck out and be more prescriptive about how we might realistically address our national eating disorder.\\"<br /><br />Regardless, this is an important and always interesting book. Highly recommended.
B0031RS2HC|4.0|Good read and thoroughly enjoyed the action packed journey that jack reacher takes you on.<br />A must read in my opinion
0847842134|4.0|I previously owned a copy of this book that was given to me and my room mate by a friend back in the '70's. I relinquished that copy to my room mate when we went our separate ways. In trying to replace it years later I discovered that it could not be had for under $300! I was so happy to see this new edition become available and even with new added pages. Serafini's style has evolved since the '70's which is to be expected, but the new pages still blend well with the rest of the book. The highly textured laid paper used for the pages might bother some readers. I personally am ok with it.<br /> This is a book that belongs in every library! A truly astonishing work! Others have described it as well as I could hope to, so I won't take any time doing that.<br />  The reason I give only four out of five stars is that it comes with a sticker on the back cover that is *very* difficult to remove. I in fact did a a tiny bit of damage to my copy removing it. There was no good reason for it being there in the first place as it only contained a blurb quote. That they used something like Gorilla Glue to hold it on mars this otherwise great volume. It's a tossup as to weather it should be removed at the risk of damage or left it place. It clearly doesn't belong there.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|couldn't read it anymore.  It lost the real story after about a quarter of the way through. It jumped around to obscure, on the fringe characters that were not interesting to me.  The Uncles story was just okay, but I wanted to hear about Abdullah and Pari. First book of his I have read and don't think I will read any more.  Life is too short and there are too many GOOD books out there.  Sorry but no  can do.
1442337966|5.0|What a wonderful book! This is a message of hope for everyone. Love is the fulfilling of the law of life. Listen to this audiobook and then pass it on to others. Better still, buy another for someone you love and want to help.
0817439390|5.0|great book for those who want to understand exposure more, nice pictures and east to read and understand this book

B00ERIUO02|5.0|Every album she comes out with is quite different then the last, but always in a good way. She doesn't produce albums nearly as fast as other artists, but when she comes out with an album it's diffidently one worth checking out. Personally, I enjoy every song on this album except &#34;this is how we do&#34;. 14 out of 15 tracks isn't bad. Especially considering most artists have 1 maybe 2 songs I like on their whole album. I'm very interested to she what she comes out with next.

B003XDUCIG|4.0|I love to cook.  I don’t always have the time, but when I do there is nothing more therapeutic than putting together a meal and serving it.  I am a huge fan of the Food network and wish it didn’t require a cable subscription to get it.<br /><br />I’m also a geek with a slant towards the so called ‘nerdy’ subjects(math, science, computers).  Even if I wasn’t working in IT I would still qualify with the love of sci-fi, music, and books.  Put to the two on a Venn diagram and in the middle you would find “Good Eats” with Alton Brown, “America’s Test Kitchen,” and this book among other shows and tomes.<br /><br />I was excited when I saw this book.  I really wanted to love this book.  Don’t get me wrong it is a good book, but for me it isn’t a great book.  The good in the book is overwhelmed by some overly geeky exposition, a few too many interviews, and style that’s just a little too dry for my taste.<br /><br />The book really delves into the science behind cooking.  Unfortunately it sometimes reads more like an article out of a high end science journal.  There are plenty of facts and I did find plenty of new, atleast to me, information that will help me cook better.  The problem is the delivery.  To be fair I’m spoiled by shows like “Good Eats” and “America’s Test Kitchen” where the science is wrapped up in an entertaining package.<br /><br />This is “Cooking for Geeks” so the delving into the hard science of cooking isn’t out of place.  The presentation is probably a matter of taste, but I did find myself wondering how much longer certain sections were.  Also, I felt like there was one too many interviews with the experts.  Again it maybe a problem of personal preference.<br /><br />The book is broken down into basic sections.  There is a fairly comprehensive breakdown on equipping your kitchen.  A very informative chapter on food safety.  A discussion on the science of taste/flavor.  An indepth discussion on the effectsof air on cooking.  An analysis of how chemicals(think salt, corn starch, sugar, etc) change the composition of food and what role they play in the cooking process. There is also a chapter on advance techniques including sous vide cooking and, a personal favorite, cooking with a lot of heat(think blowtorches and pizza ovens).<br /><br />The one chapter I didn’t mention is perhaps my favorite in the whole book.  It is an in depth discussion of what happens to food at different temperatures.  It starts with a basic discussion of what happens with heat and time.  It then moves into what happens at key temperatures like 144 degrees Fahrenheit where eggs begin to set or 356 degrees Fahrenheit when sugar begins to visibly caramelize.  I find the whole discussion fascinating, even if the writing remains a tad dry for my taste.<br /><br />Overall this book doesn’t quite hit the bulls-eye for me personally. I would still recommend it for someone who has a interest in the how’s and why’s cooking food.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It's' such a cool game. I have all the temple games and this is much better and more fun to play. I ended up deleting the temple games, because this was the only running game I played.<br /> I had no problems downloading or opening it.
B00CUKTGW6|4.0|My only dissappoint with this set is that you can't copy the songs into your computer.  The physical makeup of the CD will not allow duplication of tracks to MP3 or other electronic formats.

B009KS4XRO|1.0|This is perhaps the best of the many, many Bingo games available.  I play on my Kindle HD.  The action is fast paced, the payouts can be a little to huge, depending on what price point you select to play.  And therein lies a serious problem.  This app has a tendency to freeze frequently, especially just as it is displaying your winnings.  Sometimes, after you close and reopen the app, you will find that all is well and, you have indeed, been awarded the appropriate amount of coins, bingo tokens, power-ups, and keys.  Sometimes you lose it all, which really doesn't make much difference, UNLESS YOU WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A REAL MONEY TRANSACTION!  Twice now, I have authorized payment for bingo chips -- both times in the amount of $19.95, and both times my method of payment has been charged the $19.95 plus tax, BUT BINGO BLITZ DID NOT CREDIT ME WITH THE PURCHASED CHIPS!  I have simply lost in excess of $40.00 playing this game with no apparent way of recovering my money.  I haven't even found a means by which to contact anyone to request a refund.  So, a word of caution if you need to replenish your holdings.  And if anyone has experienced this problem and knows how to either get the money returned or get the merchandise credited to your Bingo BLITZ account, I would dearly love to learn how.  I truly can't afford to just throw my money away.  But, as I said earlier, other than that, it's a great game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|so much fun and so addicting IF YOU WANT THIS GAME GET IT it is the best game ever get this game is my life

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I like this even better than on the computer.  Fun to pass some time....and you do have to strategize a bit to win.
B00EY8BRGU|5.0|I was worried at first that the best parts of this movie were revealed in the previews, but this was far from the case!  Excellent movie! While some things were predictable, it was designed that way, so you wouldn't see the big twist at the end!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Great way to pass the time!!  Gives the same feeling like playing in an arcade.  Would recommend this game as it is easy to play
B007Y6OZE0|5.0|Great cd!  I can listen to it from beginning to end without skipping songs! Actually purchased this twice, a friend borrowed the first one and lost it. i missed listening to it so i bought it again!

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown always leaves me wanting more. His characters come to life and cause the reader to have very real feeling s for them.<br />The historic, symbolic and geographical details are mind boggling! The twists and turns of the plot keep the reader engaged and tense.<br />I highly recommend this book. The intense, intelligent writing and high-level vocabulary seduces a wide variety of readers.
1476727651|5.0|Jaded opinion alert. Having enjoyed all things Stephen King for a very long time now, I encourage everyone who loves a very intricately woven story to read Dr. Sleep. Even if you didn't read The Shining, this story will keep you turning the page. King proves again why he is the greatest novelist of all time.

0783230370|3.0|So, I guess that Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito were the first Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker?  United, they make the most of a preposterous script that never tries to be anything BUT preposterous and thus succeeds in being largely entertaining from start to finish.<br /><br />The film tells the story of two scientists who reach the end of their rope when their funding is cut dry.  In order to make it work, they decide to continue their testing on themselves, and before you know it Arnold is impregnated and begins his march towards motherhood.  He has morning sickness, gets overly emotional and eats like a horse.  Things get complicated when DeVito's ex winds up pregnant and seeking his professional help, and when a fellow scientist starts showing a special interest in Arnold, their secret risks premature exposure.<br /><br />The ending is a complete mess, but it doesn't matter.  Arnold and DeVito are a better team here than they were in `Twins', their chemistry is better suited to the material and the corn here is easier to digest.  Watching Arnold filter through maternal emotions is somewhat hilarious and makes for an interesting ride.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|My daughter loves this  app. She esp likes the mini game. All around this app is a fun little time killer when your waiting .
1449305172|5.0|I recommend this book to anyone creating a new idea in the world that hasn't been tested. This can be a startup, or a new nonprofit, or a project for a student group, or a food cart, or a book someone is writing. Anytime there is a big investment in time and a risk that the product might not match the needs of the consumer, this is the book I thrust into my friend's hands.<br /><br />I love the clear method presented for validating an idea through interviews, then scaling the business. This book turns a maze into a map!<br /><br />The biggest takeaway I have is that you must iterate on your idea BEFORE you put in a lot of time to create it. Doing this through interviews saves so much time and ensures that what you create is actually received (whether it's a business idea or not, you still want your contributions to be used by the world!). That has revolutionized how I approach every single idea I have in my life, especially ones for businesses.<br /><br />My only criticism of the book is how choppy it is. It's clear that it could have used better editing and some more time and effort to make the ideas flow together. I've been following the Spark59 blog and am entirely impressed by how quickly Ash and his team are improving the model. I can't wait for future books that are even more refined!<br /><br />I love this book so much that I created a big flowchart to map the whole process out: [...]
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Amazing, I haven't even watched the blue rays yet, but if they are half as good as the VHS, then I am satisfied
B004VYYA2K|3.0|I bought this to store my daughters barbies as well as have an added place for her to play with them and something to carry to the grandparents house. Overall its just ok. The top of the box does not stay on very well and now we have had it for alittle over a month or so and its becoming warped somewhat since she stuffs the barbies and clothes in it but thats probably our fault.

B001KTATIS|5.0|The story is bold and epic. The cast is star powered and talented. The sex scenes are measured and calculated to not completely over shadow the story. You'd have to be non human though not to get aroused. Full salute on this one.

B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Pam Grout delivers a wonderful presentation on how thought is the driver for your life.  Her dialog is very much conversational in that she provides an easy flow to the material in a format that fits today's writing styles.  So it is not a mind bender to read.  She also provides a set of experiments to try to prove the existence of the energy field that permeates us all.  I did try the \\"48 hr\\" experiment.  I asked to locate a medallion from my high school days that I had not seen for over 25 years (knowing that I did have it somewhere in my multitude of storage boxes in my basement).  During that time I was encouraged to search for something else completely unrelated to the medallion and there it was - in a box it really should not have been in.  Has it made a believer out of me?  Well, let's say it has piqued my interest to explore further and to pay more attention to what is suggested in Pam's book.  Ultimately, worth a read to expand your thought.
0316776963|4.0|A very beautiful  book about a little guy with a speech problem. Travel with him as you go through his world with him. The author has a real read on the life of a mildly handicapped lad.

B006UKFFE0|5.0|Running Lean is a must read for every team considering launching the next \\"killer start up\\" as well as any company that is testing the viability of a new product or service.<br /><br />In our experience, we adhered to the principals that Ash clearly and concisely lays out in Running Lean. By conducting experiments and examining the data, then refining our hypothesis and repeating the process we came to the conclusion that our concept was not market ready. Thanks to Running Lean, we avoided having our team waste time and saved us all unnecessary stress and heartache. And since we overcame the temptation to build/develop we were able to conserve a considerable amount of capital!<br /><br />The book paid for itself many, many times over!
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I read about this, and waited for it to be out for a couple of months to see what others were saying about it.  Finally, after it had been out for a couple of months, and I read many reviews, I decided to buy one.  For $35, I felt it would be a decent gamble if it worked, and little lost if it didn't.<br /><br />It arrived when I expected it to, and setup took only about five minutes, with much of the time required to get the device out of the box and physically connect it to my television, and power it up.  As a Netflix subscriber, I wanted a means to watch videos on my television in the bedroom, and this worked great.  It takes only seconds to switch the video from my iphone to the chromcast, and the controls remain on my iphone.  We have also used a tablet running android to play vidoes through this, and that works well also.  Basically, if you can turn on a computer and connect it to a wireless network, you can handle this device.  We have watched many movies with this, and some television shows off of Netflix, and we have had no issues with connectivity with the device during playback.  I have a wireless N router, and highspeed cable broadband (10 - 20 MBS).  Once you start the streaming to the device, you can turn off your device, as the streaming will continue straight from the wifi to the Chromecast Player.<br /><br />I am only giving this four stars, as I feel it should do more, as, right now it is limited to Netflix, Google Play, and a few others that I don't use.  I hope to see the apps to increase in the future, however, this is cheaper than a Roku device, and accomplishes what it says it will do.<br /><br />I expect significant improvements on this device over the next few months, possibly a next generation out within six months.  But, for less than the price of movie tickets for a family of four, and if you need a means of streaming videos to your television set, this is a great device.  And you don't need to be a computer scientist, or build rockets for NASA to set it up.  A television with an HDMI connection, a wireless router that you can connect it to, and a computer, smartphone, or other device to control the device with.
0345535421|5.0|Very much enjoyed Book 2 of the popular &#34;A Song of Fire and Ice&#34; saga. I am reading the books before watching the films, and I have to admit, I am glad I am doing it this way. Consider picking up these books, as they will, one day, be considered as important and relevant as Tolkien's famous trilogy.
1444737112|4.0|A homeless, recovering heroin addict meets up with a stray cat and rediscovers trust, responsibility, hope, friendship and ultimately, self-worth. The story of James and Bob the cat is told in the first person, simply and directly.  Along the way, we learn about life on the streets, and what the two must do to survive and stay together.  Bob definitely shines as a calm and stabilizing force in this young man's life as the two share their life journey. He and his &#34;person&#34; have become celebrities of a sort in London, with fans from across the globe.  I really enjoyed this book, and it's nice to see actual video of Bob the Cat on YouTube as well!

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|i have read almost all of grisham's books & with very few exceptions i think they are all very good to great reads; sycamore row in my opinion is the best or one of the very best of his books; the ending, while i suspected some links to that ending, was surprising & great maybe the best of all his books; if you are a grisham fan you probably have read a time to kill, his first or earlier book, or seen the movie; the book is great & the movie is very good as well but if you have not read the book or seen the movie i would suggest doing so then reading sycamore row; it is not a sequel, it stands alone extremely well but the two are a great one/two punch; he has some of the earlier book characters like jake barganes & his family, harry rex, lucien willbanks, sheriff ozzie walls & others in this book & it is great to read about them again in a different legal matter; i highly recomend this book to anyone who likes this type of fiction; as a trial book, it rates right up their with m connelly's lincoln lawyer series

B005LAIIFS|5.0|My family loves this movie and were so excited when it came out on DVD. There are some parts that are a little dark with the nightmare guy but overall great movie.
1449305172|5.0|18 months ago I was looking for a good guide to help me with a baby steps in Lean Startup world. And I found this book. It contains great explanation of Startup lifecycle and a list of tasks with examples and a clear phase exit criteria.<br /><br />It is amazing, I'm still using it while struggling through phases. Thank you Ash. :)
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Well if you like the book you'll like the movie so it was a no brainer for me to buy the movie.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|This trilogy takes the reader on a wonderful journey through Sweden, relationships, romance and murder. I couldn't put these books down.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|THIS COMPLETED ALL MY NEEDS FOR A CAMERA. IT WORKED JUST LOVELY. IT IS FANTASTIC, AMAZING, WONDERFUL. I REALLY LOVED IT!!!!!!!
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This is an absolutely fabulous book in sooo many different ways.<br /><br />The story plot is a fictional first person account of a brilliant scientist with an Autism Spectrum disorder. The professor decides that he should have a wife, so he goes about finding one the only way he knows to do anything. He uses a factual, step by step logical scientific approach. With this goal, he embarks on a journey that changes his life and the lives of most of the people around him. His personal growth is painful, poignant, and hilariously funny.<br /><br />May every human who dwells this earth have the opportunity to explore, discover, and grow as Dr. Tillman did. I learned a great deal, expanded my beliefs and practices, all while laughing so hard that I made my sides ache.(

B008HTQ28K|3.0|A good yarn but I miss the tense legal drama that Grisham does so well. Not his best work but interesting none the less.
B001AIRUOU|5.0|The part that holds the disc was broken upon arrival and the disc was all scratched up, and froze after the 4 minute mark when played.  I went out and bought scratch repair for the DVD as I wanted this special collector's edition.  It fixed it up mostly, there are still a couple parts where it skips a second, but not extremely noticeable.  I contacted the seller and they did not have a replacement.  This was their only copy of this DVD.  As I wanted this special edition, I chose to keep it how it is and the seller refunded the shipping fee to remedy the situation.  I am a satisfied customer.
B00FEX2ZFG|1.0|So I went to watch this and it was the first option on Amazon movies ..well didn't realize it was the bonus features and it costs just as much as the real movie...? why would a company do that? I mean seriously it stopped me from watching the actual movie. So my rating is bonus features equals straight stupid!
006202406X|1.0|I was really looking forward to the third book, I even preordered it and bought the first two in hardcover and reread them before the third one came.  Ugghh, this was terrible.  Not just the main characters depressing death but the whole thing.  It didn't even feel like it was written by the same author.  The story had such great potential.  Honestly, I wish more of the story had stayed where Divergent was, with living with the factions and really getting more of a taste of that.  The whole mind control thing happened THE SAME NIGHT that she finished her initiation and I wish we could have seen Tris finding her place in the dauntless before all the craziness happened.  But I stuck with it believing the author had a point with her story.  Not so.  It just goes downhill from the first book.  I really wish now that I had not bought them.  A trilogy should leave you feeling that it was WORTH the emotional investment, that you would read and enjoy them again and again.  What would Lord of the Rings be like if Frodo DIED! This ending left me feeling empty, sad, and a little depressed.  I will not be reading it again.
B002MQYOFW|2.0|An empty, soulless novel. I can't understand all the hype. While I can't say it was badly written, the writing seemed wooden, heartless, blank... I don't know how to explain my feelings about this particular bestseller. Everyone seems to love it, but I just didn't care for the story or for the characters. It seemed like a robot had written this book. Emotionless, wooden prose. Took me 2-3 hours to finish it, and i can't even remember a particular scene that stayed with me afterwards. Or a particular character. Nothing. Asd if I haven't even read it.
B00F9040HU|3.0|I admit I love match 3 games but this one seems to be harder to conquer even in the beginning levels. You do earn power ups but have no chance of building your inventory unlike call of atlantis. You don't ever seem to have enough time. I like being able to feel a sense of accomplishment and this just plain frustrates me. I keep playing though in the hopes I will eventually get better at it.
0061537969|5.0|I was given this book after my dog had to be put down, in my lap.  She had been in every part of my life for nearly 12 years and was \\"The Best\\" ever.  I have been lucky to have had many pet friends.  This book helped to redefine my dog's life in my heart and eyes.  I really could feel for this book's grand characters.  I have given this book as gifts to my family and friends, it is one of the best.  You will be pleased at its beginning, middle & conclusion.  May your adventures bring you many rewards, this book should become one of those rewards as well.  My dog was such a good friend.
B003L7DK74|5.0|All of the episodes never get old, and the DVDs come with great extra features like a really funny blooper reel and a stand-up comedy special.
1449305172|5.0|Maybe one of the single best books I've ever read related to start ups. Ash clearly walks through (and details) the key steps one needs to follow in order to have a chance to be successful in a start up. His emphasis on building a product someone actually wants to buy and building it before you run out of capital are absolutely critical.
B00C7TAF3Y|1.0|This game could be fun...if it would let me get beyond the first chapter.  I continue to get kicked out of the game after finishing the first set of clues.
B004G606K8|4.0|This was the first Dragonlance novel I read.  I met Flint, Tanis, Tika, Raistlin, Caramon, Kitiara, Strum, and the rest.  I was hooked.<br />If you like swords and sorcery I think you will like this book and the others in the series.  I have read many and enjoyed them all.
B00CO4GO7I|5.0|I am glad I did not read this while my son was deployed. Chris Kyle gives more than a glimpse of life in the military. He paints a picture of what he and many others have gone through and allows those of us who have never served our country get a glimpse of what it is like. So thankful for men and women like Chris who are willing to serve.
B00555X8OA|5.0|We all make decisions everyday.  We make a lot of good decisions and a lot of bad decisions.  Kahneman takes you through decsion making and gives you a structure to help you make better decisions more often.
B0017I1IZA|4.0|Another good book in the series. Fresh & funny. Stephanie always finds herself in a predicament. I wonder what else she will get herself into.
B001E45XT4|2.0|So I'm not an audiophile so I can't speak to how amazing or not the sound is, but I thought my music sounded great. The microphone was really clear and worked great for Ventrilo/Mumble. No hissing or popping and the sound appeared to match what I put into it.<br />They're very comfortable for long term use and the earpads are nice and velvety.<br /><br />HOWEVER, I've managed to break these twice now. There's a weak point just above where the microphone slots into the headset. It breaks right through the M on GAMECOM (when looking at this products listed picture). Looking over my order history it seems it takes me about 2 years to break them. I assume its due to how I put them on and the weakness of that one point. This was an almost acceptable flaw for a $25 headset. But is a complete dealbreaker for $60.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved the book divergent which led to insurgent and allegiant.The freak ending was weird but overall this book was amazing. I am devastated that the series is over-
B003CH9PTU|5.0|Awesome, great character development, great writing. Love to see parts of ABQ, however I think the show could have shown more love for ABQ.
B00FPGSPQU|2.0|The 2nd Hangover wasn't as good as the 1st but this one is outright bad.  It doesn't even stay within the storyline of the &#34;hangover&#34; ie, waking up the next day after a wild night before . . .Glad I didn't go see this one in the theater.
B00CP4GSGO|5.0|This set is great for bass hogs as the tracks dig lower than most systems can resolve.  Mine can and I love hearing the deep bass under the dreamy and sometimes drum heavy soundtrack.  Recommended!!
B0081336FO|5.0|I think the actors are great.  I appreciate the hanging notes when they are tracking a villain through the streets of London. Superb writing and good camera work.
B00DV2D0JC|4.0|Great game!!!  Very entertaining and good for passing time.  I didn't enjoy the dominoes though.  Other than that, liked the puzzles.  I can't wait to see what the sequel holds.
B00EJGMCG6|5.0|Could Testament have picked a better time to put out a live album?  \\"Dark Roots of Earth\\" was such a fantastic release, it only makes perfect sense they'd document the tour for it, and this gets it done perfectly.  This concert features four of the best tracks from it, \\"Rise Up\\", \\"Native Blood\\", \\"True American Hate\\", and the title track, all four coming on the first disc.  Having served up this much of their newest full-length, Testament concentrates on their older catalog for much of the set's remainder, playing tracks from several of their most popular albums (excluding \\"Souls of Black\\", \\"The Ritual\\", \\"Low\\" and \\"Demonic\\").  \\"The Legacy\\" is represented by \\"Burnt Offerings\\", \\"The Haunting\\", and \\"Over the Wall\\".  From \\"The New Order\\", they play \\"Into the Pit\\", \\"Trial By Fire\\", the title track, and \\"Disciples of the Watch\\".  The title track to \\"Practice What You Preach\\" is included.  Next up are four songs from \\"The Gathering\\"; \\"Riding the Snake\\", \\"Eyes of Wrath\\", \\"D.N.R.\\", and \\"Three Days in Darkness.\\"  Finally, from \\"The Formation of Damnation\\", they offer \\"More Than Meets the Eye\\" and the title track.<br /><br />While there are some songs from the excluded albums I'd love to hear, like the title track to \\"Souls of Black\\" or \\"Dog Faced Gods\\" from \\"Low\\", I'm happy with the set list.  Eighteen of Testament's best songs are tough to criticize, and again, the timing couldn't be better.  What makes this release stand out, though, is the coupling of Testament's professional proficiency and sheer ferocity onstage.  No band sounds better than Testament live, and it's been that way since they started.  The instrumentation is spot on, and Chuck Billy sounds EXACTLY the same live as he does in the studio.  For most of this release, you would swear you're listening to the regular album versions of these songs.  A band just can't get any better at replicating the sound of their recorded output.  Testament proves they are the real deal once again.<br /><br />As for the DVD, it does require a tolerance for quick-cut, color effects, occasional slo-mo \\"music video\\" editing.  I'm not really bothered by this style, as I can usually tune it out and concentrate on the songs themselves, but I can understand how some find it distracting; it actually does take a conscious effort to ignore it.  I definitely prefer longer shots and fewer added effects, which does a better job of making me feel like I'm at the show.  It seems the majority of bands go with this editing style, so it's not like Testament are out there on their own, but it would've been nice to have less obtrusive editing.  Either way, it's still a great release and highly recommended to any fan of theirs.  No metal band tops these guys.es require a tolerance for quick-cut, color effects, occasional slo-mo \\"music video\\" editing.

B00BSBVJVE|5.0|Love the book. I'm a long time Pusheen fan and I'm so glad that she finally got her own book. So proud and it's so cute, I recommend it highly.
B006BDHAX0|3.0|pro. pretty to look at. lots of fun layouts<br />cons. crashes a lot. needs more than one set of tiles.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love, love, love this game. Thanks for finally putting it on kindle.  I have been waiting a long time for this.
B000000OXH|2.0|I had never knowingly heard any Asia music and, being in the mood once more to address a musical oversight, I invested in the first two Asia Albums and sucked 'em into my laptop for my commute this morning.<br /><br />Having listened to Alpha (because iTunes alphabetizes things by name rather than publication date this was the first one to play) the best thing I can say about it is that it did not make my laptop catch fire.<br /><br />Totally bland, the Buggles sans synth. Everyone can play well, and they do, but the material is just...meh. Serious meh.<br /><br />Yes, I was expecting better. With the creds of the musicians here I was expecting more rock, more roll, more crunchy goodness. This just doesn't need more cowbell, it needs *some* cowbell.<br /><br />It's no wonder I can't remember Asia. The music is entirely forgettable and everything about the soundscape of the UK early 80s I didn't miss a bit when I emigrated to the USA in mid 84. I'd love to go into more depth here but there isn't any. This is Edison Lighthouse for the 80s, but lacking the earworm ingredients.<br /><br />I hope to gawd the original album is a bit more meaty. I'm listening to that one tonight.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It might not be pretty but it works for basic calculations and it's BIG and easy to read!  I recommend it!
B001NB545Q|5.0|Who wouldn't want to have a remastered epic masterpiece?  This is well worth it.  Arguably one of the top 5 rock albums ever recorded.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Dear God this is the best book I have ever read in the history of time, and trust me I have read many books. This book I would recommend 11 and up if mature. But read the first two in the collection, Divergent, and Insurgent. Be sure to take your time, because this is a book you just can't put down
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great story telling; full of surprising twists and turns!<br />Even though it was unrealistic, it held my attention until the end!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This USB micro to cable cord is just like the one that came with my Kindle Fire and I have had no problems with it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|At first, I was displeased at how challenging it was; then I caught on. Yes, you can pay to keep going, but with patience and perseverance--you can play for months for free! I would like to see a way to be rewarded with energy to keep playing if you solve puzzles, but it's still fun.in
034580404X|5.0|That one word is the only way I can sum up this series.  A friend recommended it to me, and boy was she right on the mark.  I fell in love with the characters right away, and read all three books in record time.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Everyone at work was talking about this game.  It is as much fun as every one of them said.  Very addictive!  I don't have a smart phone and was so pleased to be able to get this app on my Kendal Fire HD!
B008HJGPVO|5.0|This is a great stylus.  I love that it has three different sized tips so that I can use it on just about any of my devices.  I have such big fingers that I used to hit the wrong buttons all the time, now I rarely have that problem.
B009LDD1X0|5.0|I'm a hug fan of the show and this season did not disappoint. The acting and writing continue to impress me. The show is hilarious. I recommend this to anyone who needs a good laugh.
B0035LMTZA|2.0|Seriously... how they conned such a terrific cast into accepting such a played-out, predictable script is simply stunning. This movie has been done in whole or in part sooooooooo many times.<br /><br />Bunch of lovable thieves. A wise old mentor passing the torch. A betrayal. A chance to even the score with One Last Score. Someone who gets sucked into the crime while trying to stay away from that life. The betrayer loses. The big score, guy gets girl, the good guys retire on a beach. Are you freakin' kidding me??? Oh- and all the while, the entire movie is an unrepentant ad for Mini Coopers.<br /><br />I'd accept this as a late-night B flick to kill time when battling insomnia, but from THIS cast? Appalling.
B007KLKFSO|4.0|A really enjoyable read to lose yourself in. Reminded me of the insecurities we all feel growing up and wondering if we are lovable.  Made me laugh, cry and mostly just feel good.  Wanted more.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I love my Chromecast. I didn't know I'd need it until I started using it. It's the best for showing content to your friends when they come over and watching YouTube series on tv. The support for it is getting better and I can't wait until they have support for Amazon Instant Video.
B000OJFV4C|5.0|Addicted in the first five minutes. First rate production, gorgeous costumes, great acting. Of course we already know the story but this is so worth watching anyway!
B005ZMUXDC|4.0|I was so happily surprised when I watched this film after all the initial negative reviews that came out after the trailer. Although it is still a Disney film and is very formulaic, it was still a great twist on a classic fairytale, and a refreshing film to watch in the end.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game it not only has my love of dragons but also combining them, too! I have created many hybrids and I am eager to create even more! #Best game ever! I truly love this (and I am not just trying to be nice) I hope I continue to create new hybrids!
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|My only regret with simple rockets is not downloading it sooner. There are a lot of games out there that make you feel good when you complete it or simply complete a task. But the feeling of designing and building a rocket that went to the moon and back safely is a dang good feeling. I recommend this game to everyone. Sorry for the pun but it's a blast!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I had been waiting to read the sequel to the very first Grisham novel I ever read and I was not disappointed. I was on the edge of my seat with each chapter and oddly felt like cheering for both sides of the party.<br /><br />I feel as though I personally know Leftie and her family and I felt for Jake as he struggled with getting his family back on track after the infamy of Carl Lee Hailey's trial.<br /><br />I loved hearing about the old characters, too, like Lucien and Harry Rex. The way everything connected at the end kinda felt  like a family reunion.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is even fun for a grandma. This is my 8 year old grandsons game and I have been playing it. I'm 50'.
B00D2CYU2W|5.0|Price is ok and the delivery was efficient<br />It deserved the awards won<br />Performances of main cast  are great<br />Ambiance of the film is just perfect
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I like the way this application gives me direction to choose what application to close that I am not using and all the small cookies and back up files we don't need be cleaned out releasing memory for other application I need to use.
B005EHQGTS|5.0|I have used this on my Kindle HD and my HDX.  The crisp high resolution on the HDX makes it easier to use but it was equally functional in both.  A great tool to have in a pinch but on the 7 inch screen not my preferred way to work but still a nice tool to have.
B0097PW7H8|5.0|App. really works and help me to save battery in my phone and in my Kindle Fire, great to close any unwanted applications consuming energy
B000W7JWUA|3.0|I have played Settlers of Catan and really enjoyed it as a basic strategy game.  It is appropriate for a &#34;family game night&#34; that both kids and adults should be able to play without getting bored.  Unfortunately, the manufacturer's quality control isn't ready for prime time.<br /><br />Really Mayfair Games?!?  You are selling a board game that retails for $40+ and you can't be bothered to ensure that all the pieces required to play are in the box?  Boooooo.<br /><br />I was planning on playing with my kids tonight - I guess I'll have to disappoint them.
B00DH7P6WU|5.0|I would recommend getting into Ever After High if you love Monster High.  I love collecting Monster High dolls, and to be honest, I think they're offering much better quality for the Ever After High brand.  The dolls are bigger than Monster High in comparison, and I just love the packaging.  When you get this set it looks like they're standing in front of a book.  Very nice.  I would get one for any of my friends and family.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Such an inspiring book!! For any woman in any career this is a must read. Thank you Sheryl for touching on a subjects often not discussed.
0316204366|4.0|Throughout David and Goliath Malcolm Gladwell gives us the rest of the story behind a number of people, incidents, and events we think we know. And it is so hard for me not to spill the beans and talk about what we have wrong perceptions of - who were actually soldiers and what were actual weapons, how the media is more about creating a sensation than getting the participants right, how people with the best of intentions can do more damage than good when their \\"good intentions\\" are translated into real life and carried to their full extent rather than the ideals that their originators intended. Malcolm exposes how so often the sociological models used by \\"authorities\\" don't take into account the human factor - where individuals and individual actions can radically change the outcomes in directions the intellectual planners never saw coming.<br /><br />In each section we are  introduced to the background story of an individual and how their situation highlights an aspect of being an underdog or misfit. Malcolm then breaks up their story within the section, using the portion of the overarching story that was shared to springboard into a discussion of what is working, or more often not working,  in the situation presented. For me, this was where thing could get bogged down. Not because the information wasn't pertinent, but because I am a casual reader of the subject and wanted to know the rest of the story for the individual originally introduced. Most chapters conclude celebrating how they conquered the giant they were battling. In the case of any exceptions, winning strategies for battling that specific  giant are put forth.<br /><br />I would strongly recommend Section Three - Carol Sacks \\"If I'd gone to the University of Maryland, I'd still be in science.\\" to every person considering where they should go to college. Her story is one where she did not win the battle with her giant, but provides a lesson that every parent and college bound teen would be wise to study. Malcolm lays out an excellent argument that I saw played out in my own sons' journey through their college experiences. The argument is that it is better mentally, emotionally, and even career-wise, to be a Big Fish in a Small Pond than to go to a prestigious school and be a Small Fish in that Big Pond. While going to that name school may look good on a resume, the internal damage could stop you from pursuing your passion.<br /><br />An overarching theme for the book itself is the fact that these individuals did not look at what others would label \\"disabilities\\" or \\"disadvantages\\" in their lives and let that be their label, but each turned the lessons learned along the way of living different into advantages to battle the giants. By refusing to be defined by any perceived weakness, they conquered obstacles and have changed the way many of us live.<br /><br />Thank you Malcolm for introducing us to some courageous individuals and giving us insights on how they were able to conquer their giants so we have vision and strategies for taking on some of our own.
B0030CLMI4|4.0|Definitely the first Rambo expressed many Americans frustration.  I had not seen the alternate endings before.<br />Perhaps the best was the final Rambo, definitely better than the second.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Well, what a read!<br />It made the research understandable and the facts clear.<br />Uses everyday language to illustrate the facts.<br />I highly recommend it for anyone sick of/or trying to make sense of healthy<br />Weight loss and diet. A must read!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Not only a wonderfully written love story, but also a beautiful heart breaking tragedy. (Not to mention all the vocabulary that can be learned!!) ( ontological, Unconcionable...)
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Not what I expected, Hot as a pistol. Might find a use down the road but concerned about working temperature and efficiency/life span of product unless engineering intended it for supplemental winter heat source.

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I'm moving up pretty quickly but I don't want to get stuck on levels because I won't send game requests. That's gonna suck.

B009LDD1X0|5.0|This is a great show, very funny, can't wait for the next one to come out. We are big fans now.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It is difficult to know where to start. I was really looking forward to this book, and it was an enormous bummer.<br />There were so many &#34; how the heck did we get here&#34; moments. The story lurches from one event to the next. I Kept feeling like I had missed some huge important part of the story. Tobias/Four seemed to have some sort of major personality meltdown. He was an entirely different character. I expected that there would be some maturation of Tobias and Tris in this third book, but they seemed to have regressed instead. Their relationships to the new characters had no forethought, no logic.<br />The alternating point of view between Tris and Tobias was confusing. They had the same voice. I kept having to stop and try to remember who was talking. After a while I gave up trying.<br />As for the ending... Yes, it was unexpected, and heartbreaking,. Beyond that, it did not make any sense to the plot of the entire series. The way Tobias' emotional reaction was handled through all those sort little chapters was...well... stupid (I really tried to find a different word.) Those were not chapters. Did Veronica Roth have a chapter quota to meet?<br />I can picture this story being rewritten into two separate volumes with the missing plot and character development fleshed out properly. I would not read them though unless the ending was changed to fit the plot progression from the previous books, and to show maturation of the characters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't put this game down.  So much fun and it's free.  Get this game but don't buy anything in the game though.
B004UFEJXK|5.0|Wall-E is one of my all time favorite Pixar Movies...I just wish they'd release it in Blu Ray 3D. I can't find any info online about Pixar's release schedule. Wall-E, The Incredibles, Bugs Life 1 & 2, and Ratatouille, and Cars 1 haven't been released in 3D. I've heard some talk that Pixar is re-rendering their entire catalog in 4K 3D before they release them again.

B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Is privacy already in the past?  I have been thinking about our youth.  They have been photographed and videotaped since even before their birth, their every moment shared. Is privacy perhaps an alien concept to them?  This book will help us think about whether we want to keep going in this direction.  Perhaps it is already too late  to change.  The book is very direct, no subtlety, but it seems appropriate for the subject.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Before picking this book off a dusty shelf in my basement, I questioned whether it was worth reading, due to what I thought was an overrated reputation.<br /><br />I was proved dead. Wrong.<br /><br />Ender's Game is certainly a worthwhile read, if not more. I provides an escape from everyday troubles and is much like a wormhole, transporting you so deeply into something greater than you can ever imagine.<br /><br />It has plot twists on every page and plot turns around each corner.<br /><br />Never before have I felt so intricately connected to the characters of a book, or enveloped in a story so complex, than when I was reading Ender's Game.<br /><br />From a more literate point of view, Orson Scott Card is a master of words and a wizard with letters. His diction is extremely advanced, and he appears to have done his homework on the scientific facts in this book.<br /><br />In addition to that, Card opens up his political views within Ender's Game pages, which many may find very interesting. Unfortunately, not all of us are into politics - including me. I did not, however, find this dull; I found, rather, that I could relate to the political aspect.<br /><br />I hope other readers will find this as captivating and intriguing as I did; it's certainly worth all you hope and it LIVES UP TO ITS NAME!

006202406X|1.0|What a letdown! The first book was good, the second book was so-so, but this was just plain bad.<br /><br />Although this was targeted to the YA market, please give this age group a little credit. The \\"good genes\\" / \\"bad genes\\" premise is way too simplistic. Whether GP or GD, no one has the same genes. Tris was GP, but she had abilities that the rest of the GP did not, and yet the genetic researchers running the Chicago program never investigated this?<br /><br />Switching viewpoints between characters is not necessarily one of my favorite ways to read a story, but it works in some books. It did not work in this book. Without the chapter headings indicating whose viewpoint you were reading, you could not differentiate between the characters.<br /><br />The ending, as many have said, was just plain bad. It did not make sense. It was anti-climatic and it didn't provide explanations consistent with many of the characters' actions. It also alienated many readers - how would the Harry Potter movies have fared if JK Rowling had killed Harry Potter in the last book?

B00BD99JMW|3.0|I was not at all pleased with the ending of this book. I won't spoil it but I waited a long time for it  to be released and  am shocked at how it ended.
1936891026|2.0|There were a couple of things that turned me off about this book - one was the use of unnecessary profanity.  Profanity is so overused today that it has lost its ability to shock or spur to action, making the use of it in this application boring and distasteful (to me).  The second thing was Mr. Pressfield's rant on fundamentalism and those who embrace it.  This chapter, suddenly appearing in the middle of the book, was a complete turn-off.  Like many Americans, I consider my views to be moderate to slightly right of center with regard to &#34;fundamentalism&#34;, whether it be religious, social or constitutional.  Mr. Pressfield expressed that he thinks those who embrace fundamental principles are rigid, stupid and certainly not creative - it was a most unpleasant chapter and bizarrely out of place in the book.  I found myself wondering what his point was.
B008Y212PI|5.0|Love this game..I always have to play one more! It's not fast paced or exciting but it is very satisfying to figure out which squares to fill in and which squares to leave blank. One of my favorite games!
B00BD99JMW|2.0|** spoiler alert ** After the first book in the series, everything went downhill. The writing in this book needs improvement because it lacks finesse. The series in general is written as burst of action with make-out sessions evenly distributed. There is no flow of time. This is true for the final book as well.<br /><br />Additionally, the characters were not believable. The narration switches between Tris and Tobias, but their voices are not very distinct.<br /><br />Tris speaks lines of wisdom that do not seem genuine to here character. They were placed there by the author to ensure that a \\"message\\" was sent, but the way it was done was obvious and implied that the author did not have faith enough in her readers to get the deeper, implied messages.<br /><br />The scientific aspects of the plot were also awful. There should have been more research done, so the explanations could have been moderately believable. Additionally, the scientific solution to the story does not seem like a feasible one. The resulting problems and plot holes were not addressed.<br /><br />THIS PART HAS SPOILERS!!!<br /><br />Usually I can appreciate the death of a major character. In fact, there have been times that I am satisfied (while emotionally scared) with the death. It is harder to write a satisfying death ending than a happy ending. Roth did not write a satisfying death ending. Instead the death ending seemed to be there just to cause a stir. The reason why I did not find Tris's death satisfying is because it transformed her into a mythical hero. No longer was she a girl who repelled for the right reason. She becomes immortal as an imaginary figure rather than a human being. Thus, Tobias will never have the chance to recover and overcome the loss of Tris.

B00BD99JMW|3.0|SPOILER ALLERT (general not specific)<br /><br />I enjoyed this book until the end. It was displeasing and ruined this entire trilogy for me. It used to be some of my favorite books but because the author made a most hated choice of killing off some characters the ending was left uncompleted in my mind. I wish the ending was happy. Believe me I don't only like stories with a &#34;happy ending&#34; but this left me with a huge hole still needing answers.<br />To make up for the death, Veronica said they did it out of love and other deep emotions which was okay until the other character wanted to erase their memory so they wouldn't have to suffer. I wish it at least included that they met in some sort of afterlife.<br /><br />It was sloppily written in the last few chapters stating flashbacks to when the character was alive, then ended with the spreading of their ashes. I was happy when I found out they included an epilogue which only the pressing of the ashes took place.<br /><br />It was still a well written book but left me disappointed without answers.

B0036TGT2A|5.0|For those with a compatible 3D TV - do not miss out on this release! It truly is an art form to convert something into 3D that wasn't originally intended. This is my favorite movie of all time, so I've seen it a million times. Watching it in 3D was like experiencing it for the first time. It's something you really have to see, words don't do it justice. Not to mention, this release features some new great special features that give you insight into how the film was animated by studying actors who acted out the whole movie on a small set. There's also a beautiful piece about the lyricist who I feel is responsible for the Disney renaissance, it brings a tear to the eye.

B00BD99JMW|2.0|I read 'Divergent' after I went on a speculative fiction tear and Amazon suggested it to me. Ok, I'll sign on to a future Chicago where everyone calls the buildings and the streets by their old names and everyone wears colors to signify their faction and people act according to the stringent rules of their factions, sure. I'll accept the author's weird anorexia porn heroine (she's so small! and strong! but also skinny! she's got lean muscles tho! maybe she does pilates??? her boyfriend's hand spans her entire stomach! because she's small. like a skinny person.), I'll accept that this future city just lets a bunch of hooligan teenagers run around, despite the fact that there are rules for everything else, I'll accept it. I got all the way through 'Insurgent' with my disbelief stretched like Tris' skin across her bony rib cage (she's so skinny, she's like a bird, a fragile bird who can hold a grown man at gunpoint).<br />Fifty pages into 'Allegiant,' my eyes glazed over, and they didn't stop being glazed until the end, where I cried (I cry at everything) away all the glaze.<br />Let's start with the weakest conceit in the book and peel back the layers:<br />--The perspective &#34;switches&#34; from Tris to Tobias every chapter. The two are indistinguishable, and each has the interior complexity of a hypothetical character in a freshman-level ethics class scenario. &#34;Which is worse, killing a bunch of people or killing one person? Killing one person or killing another person? Losing your memory so other people don't die?&#34;<br />--The psuedoscience would be weak for any teen novel, but for a novel purporting to be dystopian sci-fi it is astounding. Though I accept the existence of serums, because Roth's writing is basically a serum that makes you feel bored and annoyed at the same time, and that is a feat.<br />--Roth's writing is capital-R repetitive. Every chapter is this: &#34;They said GP but I think GD and really if we serum then ~moral conundrum~. What is love? LOVE IS A BURNING KNIFE MADE OF LOYALTY. I'm 16.&#34; She uses the same images over and over, and her characters keep tripping over the same stumbling blocks.<br />--The characters are cardboard cutouts with cardboard feet and that's why they keep tripping. Tobias, tall dark and handsome, forged in the cold fires of an abusive childhood. Tris, a weak and fragile baby bird, spreads her wings through love and bullets. Peter, an evil person. Christina, a girl. Caleb, a brainiac with no moral compass.<br />--The entire plot. This entire book felt forced. Like Roth had a great idea two books ago and completely ran out of steam/ideas before she could reach the end. As the reader I could literally feel her wading around in her own plot, sweeping her hands through the mucky bottom and coming up empty. I would almost feel bad except she has like a $34589034589 movie deal from her Shitty Katniss and the Goblet of Coals so whatever.<br /><br />One thing that I really, really like about the book was the representation of characters of different races, different gender orientations, etc. Even though Tris and Tobias are written as white, there is still a range of supporting characters who do make choices, have relationships and personalities. If you don't think this kind of representation matters, you are probably already represented. I appreciate and respect Roth for writing characters who are explicitly people of color, so bigots can't freak out when the characters aren't white in the movie.

B00CPTUN5G|5.0|I got this for my 5 year old son, who loves MLP (although he might be a little loath to admit it!) But you don't have to be into MLP to really enjoy this, its actually very funny watching TwSp adapt to life as a girl (&#34;I'll have my coffee with extra oats&#34;!) and all her misadventures (especially with the computer). Major themes about friendship (of course), teamwork and forgiveness. Its even a little scary at the end when Sunset shimmer turns into a monster/demon-but not too scary. If you are into MLPs, you will have fun identifying all of the pony characters as humans (Granny Smith as a lunch lady, Apple Bloom and the crusaders, Featherweight, etc.). The songs are catchy and the animation is everything you'd expect it to be from the series. I highly recommend this!

B00BD99JMW|2.0|Let me just say that I am upset that she killed of Tris, but what is more upsetting is the way that is was done. I get why she did it, but it felt like it was so rushed and not well executed. Here is my rundown of what didn't work for me and how I would have liked to see Tris die.<br /><br />1) If you are going to kill the main character please make us fall in love with one of the other characters as well so we can move on with them. Of course I loved Tobias, but we don't get to hear from him till this last book and well, I liked him more before I heard his internal dialog. Tobias started sounding pathetic. He didn't want to look at the new world, was shaking, looking down at his hands. He was strong in the first 2 books and now all of the sudden he is weak. He let Tris run over him, he follows a girl he doesn't even know to try and stop something he doesn't understand. If Veronica wanted to kill Tris in the end maybe we should have had both points of view from the beginning. I don't really love that since it gets confusing, but at least then we would feel equally invested in both characters.<br /><br />2) This new world sucked. It didn't make sense. Why would you need to have people live in a fake world to create pure genes. If they had the technology to damage our genes, then you think they could have the ability to change things in a lab. Maybe they could have produced hundreds of fetuses, till more babies showed pure genes. Not that that would have been nice either, but it would have been a hell of a lot faster then 200 years. Do you really think that scientist would have gone this route, with as fast as things move today. But just to go with it, lets say this all happened this way. Why didn't they just use the memory serum on the Abnegation so that they wouldn't tell everyone the big secret instead of letting them all die from Simulation. Especially since a lot the the Abnegation where Divergent. For that matter why did they need the video to begin with. Why did anyone in Chicago every need to know that there was an outside world. If the Bureau didn't need for them to come out, then it seems pointless to have the people in Chicago believe in some outside war. Couldn't the Bureau still have had the aptitude test to find out who was Divergent. And then they could send in people to take their DNA and let things proceed. Did the Chicago world need to think that being divergent was bad? I just didn't get how all of this would help the outside society. If there was a Purity war and now they are tying to make everyone pure again, why doesn't the government just kill off all of the damaged people and start to populate the world with the small pure population. Or, why wouldn't the government inculcate all the GPs and use the memory serum on the whole GD population across the country and then they would have made them all follow the factions and watched from high above. I don't get the little experiments. It already sounds like the GP wanted to get ride of the GD. And there are no shortage of people out to get what they want. Wouldn't the bigger government with all it's pretty powerful weapons just taken over society as a whole?<br /><br />3) How would getting ride of the Bureau's memories fix everything. What about the outside government. The Bureau answered to other people. Those people didn't loose their memoirs. Wouldn't they wonder what happened? There where so many answers we never got about the bigger picture. Like what about the rest of the world? Did everyone fall victim? Did the USA take over the world? How did people start to believe that GD people where the cause off all evil? How did they make the whole world forget that there has always been war and to make people believe they are damaged?<br /><br />4) Tris. Besides the fact that the rest of the book didn't really make sense I am going to go with it and try to see it form Veronica's point of view. Follow the character arc. So Tris has to die. I get it. We believe thewhole story, it makes sense and then she just gets shot. REALLY!!. She has gone through so much and is smart and calculating. Yet at the end she is so dumb. I don't mind that she sacrifices herself for her brother, that makes sense. Even that she might drop her gun due to Death Serum, but then when she is standing in front of a man in a wheelchair who has probably rarely shot a gun and she dives for the control box? You don't think she might have tried to disarm him? He still might have gotten off one good shot, but she most likely could have stopped him from killing her. And then to top it off Veronica has her just die. And then she is in the morgue and then they spread her ashes. It all felt uncaring and rigid.<br /><br />5) Here is how I think it would have been nice for Tris to die. I am not a writer and I know that she has a right to do what she wants with the story. But her readers put a lot of time into reading and we all get invested. I really just wish the the characters could of all had more closure. I think it would have been beautiful if Tris decides to sacrifice herself, she get into the room, she sees David and she is trying to talk him down. She goes for the gun, it goes off, she gets hit. She gets the gun way and as she is about to shoot David, Caleb make it into the room, as he realized that he needed to help her, and he is barely standing from the poison. He gets a shot off and kills David. Tris runs to help him. She can barely stand. They have a quick meaningful conversation about forgiveness, life, their parents. Then Caleb dies. Tris cries and then crawls to the control box types in the code and passes out. Tobias comes back and finds them both in the room . The death serum is gone. He takes here to the hospital. She is in a coma. (we omit the fact the Uriah was in a coma) They say she won't make it but that you can talk to her through a serum. Tobias, Christina, Uriah, Zeke, Cara...they all take the serum. They are with Tris at the top of theHancock building. They are all laughing. Talking about life, bravery, being more than just one Faction. The group starts to jump each one says goodbye to Tris. Then Tris and Tobias are left. He is still afraid of heights and she talk him into using his fears and making the world better. They stand at the edge. Holding hands and they jump off together. They scream on the way down. Smile and each other and then Tris floats away.<br /><br />Not saying that this is any better, but this is the type of thing I wished for. Taking you back to the beginning characters, the simulations, the fact the Tobias was always going through his fear landscape. At the end this is the last fear landscape that he has to go though and he gets to do it with Tris like he did in the beginning.

As a reader, most of the time I felt like I was right there with her, step by step and that is quite an accomplishment on the Authors part.<br /><br />This is a rich story, full of insightful wisdom. It shows how someone who is down and out can do something, even if it's a bit radical, to change their lives, start over and give themselves a fresh start.  Whether it's a green monster on your back or the emotional baggage life hands you, a book like this inspires positive perspectives and that's always a great thing.<br /><br />This is a book I look forward to reading again.

0062225677|4.0|How does one rate a book published thirty years ago, by an author considered among the greats of our day, and that commences one of the most read and popular series in recent times?<br />The Color of Magic introduces us to Discworld, a series that has grown to include forty novels. Given that I didn't discover Terry Pratchett or Discworld until the 2004 Going Postal, which was number 33 in the series, it might be asked how I jumped in, as well as whether the series ends. Fortunately, each novel stands alone, and no new reader needs to have read previous books in order to understand what's going on in this one.<br /><br />Since Going Postal, I've since read a couple of other Discworld novels, but I've never read the early ones. That changed when, a couple of months back, my good neighbor and friend Mike mentioned that he was looking for a good home for his substantial collection of Pratchett novels, including nearly all of the Discworld novels. I about wet my pants with excitement when I heard and couldn't wait to start reading.<br /><br />The Color of Magic lays out the elements of Discworld that have since become familiar to millions (I once read that Pratchett's books had the distinction of being those most often stolen from booksellers in the British Isles): Discworld is flat. As is explained in another of the Discworld novels, when introducing the character Death:<br /><br />\\"This is the Death whose particular sphere of operations is, well, not a sphere at all, but the Discworld, which is flat and rides on the back of four giant elephants who stand on the shell of the enormous star turtle Great A'Tuin, and which is bounded by a waterfall that cascades endlessly into space.<br /><br />\\"Scientists have calculated that the chance of anything so patently absurd actually existing are millions to one. But magicians have calculated that million-to-one chances crop up nine times out of ten.\\"<br /><br />If that doesn't give you enough of a taste to tell that Discworld is not only part fantasy but also partly tongue-in-cheek satire, then one need only get to know the heroes of the quest to realize how little Pratchett takes his fictional world seriously (unless you consider being serious about writing a rollicking good story, which Pratchett is). Rincewind is the wizard who lacks any real wizarding skills, except perhaps that he's very good at dodging death (both in the abstract and the concrete in the person of Death). Along for the ride, if as the ostensible McGuffin, is Twoflower, a tourist from a far of empire who is oblivious to danger, and The Luggage, a semi-sentient and energetic piece of luggage made from sapient pearwood, and Cohen the Barbarian (and he's not a mockery of Schwarzenneger's Conan, I'm not sure what is).<br /><br />Each is a riff or commentary, delightfully and humorously drawn to entertaining effect, and it's not hard to hear echoes of Mark Twain and Douglas Adams in Pratchett's writing, though, to be honest, Pratchett is a flavor all his own. Here are a few lines that Pratchett slips in, each full of commentary and satire, and yet humorous all on their own:<br /><br />\\"The Watch were always careful not to intervene too soon in any brawl where the odds were not heavily stacked in their favour. The job carried a pension, and attracted a cautious, thoughtful kind of man.\\"<br /><br />\\"Picturesque meant - he decided after careful observation of the scenery that inspired Twoflower to use the word - that the landscape was horribly precipitous. Quaint, when used to describe the occasional village through which they passed, meant fever-ridden and tumbledown. Twoflower was a tourist, the first ever seen on the Discworld. Tourist, Rincewind had decided, meant `idiot'.\\"<br /><br />\\"What heroes like best is themselves.\\"<br /><br />\\"He wondered what kind of life it would be, having to keep swimming all the time to stay exactly in the same place. Pretty similar to his own, he decided.\\"<br /><br />\\"Some pirates achieved immortality by great deeds of cruelty or derring-do. Some achieved immortality by amassing great wealth. But the captain had long ago decided that he would, on the whole, prefer to achieve immortality by not dying.\\"<br /><br />\\"I've seen excitement, and I've seen boredom. And boredom was best.\\"<br /><br />And Pratchett's The Color of Magic is anything but \\"boredom.\\" If you've never had the opportunity to enjoy a Discworld novel, The Color of Magic is a fantastic place to begin.<br />(And many thanks, Mike, for gifting me the wonderful lands of Discworld.)mortality by great deeds of cruelty or derring-do.

0385743564|4.0|Steelheart, first in the Reckoners series, may have the broadest appeal of Brandon Sanderson's growing variety of imaginary worlds. At a time when Marvel and DC turnout multiple blockbusters at the movie theater each year-think The Avengers, Iron Man, the Dark Knight, and Man of Steel-interest in superheroes is at an all time high and Sanderson's look at the dark potential of super-powered humans is a timely and relevant addition to the genre. For a guy who kicked of his career with epic fantasy, it also shows the breadth of his imagination and flexibility.<br /><br />Rather than swords and sorcery, Sanderson's premise is flight and telekinesis, invisibility and fire. What if the supernatural powers of Superman, the Flash, and Captain America didn't just make them more than human, but also corrupted them, too?<br /><br />For a genre that has always been willing to show the light and the dark sides of human nature, compounded exponentially by the bright and dark natures of the heroes and villains holding those powers, it's not an entirely new look, but it does take a new spin. Any reader of comic books knows that almost every superhero is just as likely to take a turn to the dark side, but only in Sanderson's world does that actual endowment of superpowers nearly guarantee that the turn will happen. Power corrupts, Sanderson says, quoting Lord Acton, and absolute power corrupts absolutely. Sanderson's super-powered humans-or Epics-are power hungry and evil, killing and taking at whim.<br /><br />How does humanity survive?<br /><br />Told from the perspective of David, a normal human who at the outset of the story accidentally witnesses one of the nascent superheroes, Steelheart-of whom his description of superpowers it eerily similar to the better known \\"Man of Steel,\\" Superman-Steelheart is about the quest to find a way to defeat the villainous super-powered humans that have carved out fiefdoms for themselves across America (and presumably the rest of the world). David is obsessed with understanding each Epic, charting their powers, their weaknesses, and more as he plots his revenge against Steelheart for the death of his father.<br /><br />Conceived in 2007 when Sanderson was still a newly published author, Steelheart may be recognition by his publisher that he has a platform and an audience that will buy Sanderson's books, almost no matter what he writes. This isn't to say that Steelheart is not good, or that it would not have been published otherwise, but it is a step outside of Brandon's brand of epic fantasy, a bit more young adult than Elantris, Warbreaker, or the Mistborn series, and far more comic book than anything else Sanderson has yet produced.<br /><br />In that sense, I see in Steelheart the most potential of any of Sanderson's own works (I'm not including the Wheel of Time since I consider that to be Robert Jordan's creative genius to which Sanderson added his considerable writing ability). The story, set in a post-apocalyptic and dystopian Chicago (Newcago, Sanderson's renames it), featuring day-after-tomorrow weapons and technology, capped supervillains, and a cast of colorfully written characters, would translate well into film or television. Videogames could be easy to add to the brand, as well.<br /><br />All good ideas aside, though, I wish Sanderson had spent just a little more time with the novel. The plot feels rushed and the relationships only superficially developed. When David meets Megan, about the most we learn about his attraction to her is about how she looks in a short, red dress and her ability to shoot a gun. I'm no stranger to the attraction of a woman in a short skirt (cue up Cake's Short Skirt, Long Jacket, please), but the depth of the relationship and David's motives never really deepen much more. I suspect that this is in large part because Sanderson is writing for a young adult audience, but age has never been a reason to short-thrift the young. Gary D. Schmidt`s Wednesday Wars and Okayfor Now prove that you don't need to be superficial or shallow, nor do you have to treat teens like they can't understand what it means to grow up. Granted, we're reading about superheroes here, and maybe my expectations are too high, but the driving force of the conflict is David's relationships, and Sanderson's handling feels rushed.<br /><br />That said, Sanderson executes the premise almost flawlessly. His Epics are epic villains, his plotting is careful, and the final twist is a satisfying moment for the triumph of good-real good, not just the `good guy'-over evil. Borrow or buy, Steelheart is a welcome addition to the fast growing Sanderson collection, one that you should read soon.for Now prove that you don't need to be superficial or shallow, nor do you have to treat teens like they can't understand what it means to grow up.

B0024SQW2Q|4.0|Underworld series prequel earning 4 of 5 mainly because it is a roller coaster ride that was fun for me. As the third in the series I expected forward with Selen and Michael, but the Underworld producers went back to the beginning.  Here you have the story of Lycans and Vampires that led to the original Underworld movie.<br /><br />This one embraces the Romeo and Juliet plot and converts it to fit in the world of vampires and werewolves.  Much more info and too much is revealed, I think.  You still have all the action and excitement well known for the Underworld series.  No Kate Beckinsale as Selene to drool at, as Rise of the Lycans is actually a prequel to Underworld. Enter the beautiful Rhona Mitra as Sonja. Folks may know Rhona Mitra was Claire Radcliff in the wonderful TV series, The Gates: A vampire and werewolf TV series that was sadly canceled after the first season.  Rhona is not a step down from Kate, so those who come to drool, you've not been forgotten.<br /><br />Lucian, a new kind of Lycan, plays Romeo to Sonja, a princess Vampire as Juliet. All the emotions you might put in any adaptation of Shakespeare's play you can invest in this outing.  Except, in my opinion, you should wear a seat belt as well.<br /><br />If you haven't watched these Underworld movies the watch order should be Rise of the Lycans, Underworld, Underworld: Evolution, Underworld: Awakenings. #3, #1, #2, #4. These movies had good writers and among the action, excitement, and gore are good stories that should entertain more than just an adrenaline fix.<br /><br />J. Michael Stracynski was my motivation to watching the series.  JMS screenplays are always good.  When I heard he wrote &#34;Awakenings&#34; I jumped in and watched the earlier movies first.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I had bought a Smith and Wesson M&P knife for work and after a good amount of use my knife had dulled to the point of almost being laughable. I had looked around and put off purchase of a knife sharpener for quite some time as I really didn't know what I was looking for. I'd seen this product in several sporting goods stores and after reading reviews on Amazon I decided to give it a try. Worst case scenario I was out about $9 and would look for another sharpener. After reading up on the best practices I attempted to sharpen my knife and I was definitely impressed with how the sharpener performed. It brought life back to my dulled blade and it performed like it originally had. I would very highly recommend this product for someone like me who was just looking for a quick and easy way to sharpen their EDC knife for work and camping or anything of the sort.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Although this is meant to be fiction, I love how Veronica integrates real life instances into the Divergent Trilogy. Many people say that the ending was &#34;disappointing,&#34; but I think that she had a realistic point of view, and chose to stick with it. It was extremely saddening and heartbreaking- the ending of Allegiant and the Divergent Series- but that being said, I am somewhat contempt with the ending as well. -N

If you have some experience or are willing to look up similar dishes to get a gist of how it should look, this book has some fabulous recipes!!

B005PWPUW6|5.0|This product is excellent.  The size is very compact and doesn't seem like it's larger than it needs to be.  I recently updated my TV from a LG 32in LCD to a LG 42in LED.  My PX21's were connected to the older TV via 3.5mm.  However, the newer TV was missing the 3.5mm port.  Connected an optical cable from my 360 slim to the FiiO, and the PX21's 3.5mm connector into the &#34;line out&#34; port on the FiiO.  On the 360, make sure the audio is set to &#34;Stereo&#34; because any of the &#34;Surround Sound&#34; setting will not output audio to the headphones. I believe if you connect the device to the TV, you change the audio settings on your TV to &#34;PCM&#34;.  I am very satisfied with this product.

B00DR0PDNE|2.0|As a self-professed gadget hound, I had to at least give Chromecast a chance to prove it wasn't worth my investment of time and money.  After 3 hours of plugging away, I have yet to experience a strike (almost as bad as my fishing luck but how far is this silly \\"casting\\" metaphor for the sake of alliteration worth taking)? I was more than a little impressed by my $60 ROKU box (a gadget that's so effective I gave two to my grandkids and an extra to my wife, who occasionally uses it at her desk).<br /><br />Next up was the Apple T'V box, which admittedly has seen far less use.  Part of the problem is the tiny aluminum remote control, which has proven virtually impossible to keep track of for more than 3-4 days at a time (a replacement is $20--or you can download the free (but unsatisfying) one from the App Store).  Equally problematic with Apple TV is that I really don't get any extra pleasure from \\"streaming\\" videos, photographs, and audio files from my computer to my 40\\" Sony--esp. when no one else appreciates the novelty.  And unlike ROKU, Apple TV doesn't offer videos from Amazon, many of which come with no extra charge to Amazon Prime members.  True, iTunes has become the store with everything for every body, but frankly I found it more useful as a \\"dedicated\\" music service.  Of late iTunes has become cluttered in appearance and sluggish (even stubborn) in operation due to its many offerings (tunes, apps, books, magazines, movies and now extending to major computer programs and operating systems along with its iCloud and social services.  I had until recently always thought of Apple as a cutting-edge innovator, trend-setter, and \\"leader\\"--sort of the \\"Miles Davis of consumer electronics.\\" It seems almost sad these days to see this former giant-slayer looking to sites like Facebook and even Pandora for guidance.  Beginning perhaps with \\"Genius\\" and continuing, most recently, with the iTunes \\"radio station\\" Apple has stooped to the \\"gonzo\\" revenue-producing tactics used by dozens of mediocre companies to hijack personal information from anyone who surfs the internet or uses a computer--the better to serve \\"individual\\" choices (i.e. by selling more media products that match up the user's \\"profile\\"--i.e. the personal \\"tastes\\" of the consumer).<br /><br />I should have known, especially since Apple TV saw so little use, that the investment in Chromecast would be problematic. After two hours I managed to set up, through my wi-fi, my very own \\"casting\\" channel (using an iPod Touch) and am now staring at at the words, in large font on a 40\\" Sony screen, \\"ready to cast.\\"  Looking at my iPod screen, I see two options--YouTube and Netflix--but clicking on either produces no change to my television picture.  I've even pulled out my 2011 Mac Air, which can offer me Chrome as an alternative to Safari (along with dozens of questions asking me for a simple check in response for Google's request for personal material on my computer--information that I'm loathe to disclose, since all I stand to receive in return is the ability to cast/throw/mirror/extract/download a few Youtube or Netflix images viewable on my TV.  And now I see notes from Google warning of a \\"small caveat\\" that Chromecast is optimized for the 2012 or newer Mac Air (when \\"Chromecasting\\" with a 2011 Mac Air, I was \\"skunked).<br /><br />In conclusion, this is a potentially nifty little gadget (not much bigger than a thumb drive) for the right person with the right browser and the right equipment. But besides problems with getting Chromecast to cast a youtube video (I finally got it to perform as advertised with an iPod Touch 5g), I was unprepared for the extra clutter of a USB powered cable (which, unlike my Roku or Apple TV, isn't long enough to reach from the closest AC outlet to the required HDMI port. (You could spend $15 for an AC outlet that adheres to the back of a TV set ([[ASIN:B00CQ9F2XS InstaOutlet Google Chromecast Streaming Media Installation kit]].  But now you're within $10 of an infinitely more useful ROKU box).  I've read a couple of reviewers who rationalize that the ChromeCast is a great little \\"back-up\\" for use on the road. I already have 2-3 back-ups, and my road warrior days are behind me. The way I see it, one less Chromecast will save me enough to pay for almost 4 days of my cable package.e within $10 of an infinitely more useful ROKU box).

B007K3JFUQ|5.0|While only loosely based on the Holmes canon this film is quite faithful to its spirit. Holmes and Moriarty are doppelgangers and throughout the film one feels that one cannot exist without the other and the climax will be devastating to both. It seems to play out that way but I won't spoil it.<br /><br />There is another subtext throughout the film that was not, and indeed could not be, present in Doyle's stories. There is a definite undercurrent that the 19th century and the Victorian era is coming to an end and that we are seeing a glimpse of the century to come. While watching Holmes and Watson thwart Moriarty the viewer is left with the impression that the final victory might have been Moriarty's. While usually not a fan of projecting modern perspectives back into an historical setting here it seems to have been handled just right.<br /><br />The film is highly recommended. I think director Ritchie's Holmes movies are a perfect blend of respectful reverence for Doyle's stories and modern storytelling trends with their emphasis on fast paced, over the top action and special effects.
1400079276|1.0|I've read six or seven books by Harumi Murakami, two of which I thought were excellent (\\"Norwegian Wood\\" & \\"Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche.\\")  However after this book, and the disappointing IQ84, I might be done.  Situations were set up over the first 50 pages that seemed like they might be interesting, but then didn't really go anywhere.  Characters didn't evolve or even act consistently.  Too much of this felt like a retread over the author's previous ground.  For instance the narrator talks about brand names and everybody talks about the cool jazz music, Beethoven, and Baby Boomer rock that presumably the author loves as well.  Women exist purely to throw themselves sexually at men, there's weirdness with the spirit world that I felt didn't truly resolve itself, and was sometimes weird for weirdness's sake...<br /><br />I was off-put by several scenes that didn't fit into the overall structure and were a pain to read, the cat torture scene and a lengthy diatribe against feminism being the first ones that come to mind.

As an advisor and counselor to startups, this is the one book that I recommend the most for entrepreneurs trying to find their way (and even those who already have a pretty good idea what they're doing).

The book was somewhat believable and I couldn't wait to see what happened to the characters.

I couldn't put this book down as it had me on the edge of my seat every time a chapter came to an end. I am not a big reader but this book really caught my attention. If you read Hunger Games, I would strongly suggest read Catching Fire. It is debatable that Catching Fire is better than Hunger Games, I think it is! It is a love story between Katniss, Peeta, and Gale. Are you a Katniss and Gale fan or a Katniss and Peeta fan? Be careful who you choose because President Snow is watching everyone's move. Katniss and Peeta must make all the districts believe they are truly in love and this is not all an act as a direct order from President Snow or even a threat. Will Katniss and Peeta succeed and even convince President Snow? Or will the districts think Katniss was trying defy the capitol and everyone start to rebel? But will they even need to after President Snow tells everyone his plan for the Quarter Quell? I was really surprised by the ending of this book and cannot wait to read Mocking Jay, part three to the Hunger Games. Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and their families must now fight a battle against the Capitol that they can't back down from.

Your highest score for each screen is saved, so you can go back and try to beat it if you want.  I play a little each evening. I would probably play all night if I could, but only allow myself a few screens/levels to prevent my head from exploding.  Good game that never gets boring!  I recommend it.

0765325950|4.0|The general reader will find this book worth the wait. Those of us who have followed it for decades will be a bit harder to please.<br />The book is fast paced, far, far, far more than any other book of the series, for of course he has to get everything in, from Andor to outward, and from Tear to the Blight. The side effect of this was that several interesting things that could have happened, that from the point of view of the story itself did happen, were completely ignored. For instance, the meeting between Moiraine and Lan was not written. Nor was the marriage of Thom and Moiraine. Excluding such events probably shaved an hundred pages from the book.<br />I disagree with Mr. Ashby's review on a number of points (namely that Deathly Hallows had a poor ending) but he is correct that one core character fell, and it was a kick in the teeth. As predicted, just like in Harry Potter, the main character does not, cannot die, but JK Rowling did a better job of making the audience fear it. Demandred's secret identity was less disappointing than Mazrim Taim's, but the two authors pulled it off, I think, simply by not writing about it. I disliked the sequence for Egwene (I must admit to its power and effectiveness) but I really hated the Suian Sanche sequence. From one view it was absolutely necessary, but I still hated it. It was effective writing, however. A mention of a homosexual character or two was placed in this book.  One person said that was too little, too late. I see no reason why sexual preference of characters would have any bearing on the last battle, though perhaps it was done to balance all the talk of \\"pillow friends\\" in earlier books. I must disagree that no \\"C-rate\\" heroes and heroines died in this book. But for two primary characters, to my mind, everyone that dies is off secondary importance. Many had less than an hundred words of dialogue. But I must agree entirely with the reviewers who mourn Bela as I do, and that the Horn Blower was the perfect surprise.<br /><br />Mat comes into his own in this book, and his primacy is so obvious once it happens you will think, \\"how in the hell did I not expect that?\\" on a conscious level. I think we all expected it subconsciously. Perrin does not quite get the glory Mat does, but is just as important. Rand's defeat of the Dark One was surprising, but upon reflection, was appropriate. It was also well done, as was the time dilation effect/disparity between different sections of the Last Battle. I must state that it was a very complex battle, and had I my way, the peripheral battles would also have been mentioned (what happened at Tar Valon, Far Madding, Ankor Dail, etc.) This would not be cause I wanted to make something complex complexer (that's fun to say, complexer), but because it has to be more complex to be realistic. A simple duel with lightsabers will not suffice for Rand to beat the Dark One! No, Rand must fight at Shayol Ghul, after getting everyone else on the same page, Mat has to win the \\"mundane\\" part of the Last Battle, and Perrin guards Rand's flanks, not only directly, but also in aiding the Asha'man. No, the complex battle fits both the legend of this story, and the military logic to which the authors must conform. There were some parts that were painful, but that is fitting.<br />Rand's part was the least satisfactory, but it more than works, and now we know why the Last Battle is repeated when the Wheel Turns.<br />As for the pipe, Rand no longer needs to be the Dragon Reborn, but the Pattern rewards him for his service by letting him still be ta'veren.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I couldn't put the book down.  Her writing style changes to reflect where she is and it's an engaging read.
030758836X|5.0|I came to this book without expectations. It seems everyone but I had heard of it and already added it to their Goodreads \\"Want to Read\\" bookshelf, but it's all in character for me, so I shouldn't be surprised. That being said, I only got to page 16 before I decided I loved this book. Gillian (like my name, so we're practically twins!) Flynn's Gone Girl is a perfect specimen for a morbid curiosity. The girl in question is Amy Elliott Dunne, the supposed victim in a missing person's case. Her husband Lance Nicholas \\"Nick\\" Dunne is the supposed perpetrator (because it's always the husband, right?). Amy and Nick are beautiful, successful, clever, and bursting with love for each other, but when both are laid off, the initial spark of their marriage dies out, and a family crisis uproots them from their beloved Manhattan and lands them in Nick's rural Missouri hometown of North Carthage, the two are embroiled in a battle of wit, sadism, and manipulation. You won't be able to tear your eyes away from this train wreck, and you may think you can predict the outcome (and maybe you're better at that than I am), but you will enjoy the unfolding of this disastrous relationship the whole time.<br /><br />Read the rest of my review on my blog: [...]
0345525558|5.0|I was given this book by my sister-in-law to read on a trip. She really believed I would love it.  She knows I am an avid gardener.  She was right.  From the first paragraph I was hooked. I had no idea that flowers had sentimental meanings.  It taught me so much about the meaning of flowers and the meaning of life.
B000J10ER4|4.0|I can't really rate this movie, because I've only watched bits and pieces of it. I ordered it for my son. He likes it.

0385349947|5.0|Even if you are not in a leadership position, you can get some insight on how women react in certain situations. I read parts of this book to my daughter and she said that she sees herself doing some of these things and has changed how she operates. She has seen a difference in how others treat her and how they react to her. She has even been put in some more leadership roles. I highly recommend this book...for everyone.
B00E0SXNE8|5.0|Cute movie, my daughter loves this movie=)<br />Looks really great on her Kindle Fire HD Screen.<br />Great for road trips or long excursions in the car.
B00701QV8W|5.0|One of my favorite albums since I first heard it shortly after it was released way back when.  Had it on vinyl, tape and CD. One of the kids &#34;borrowed&#34; the cd, so I got a replacement.  Another kid borrowed that one.  This is my third cd.

Aside from the hit single \\"Roar,\\" I really enjoyed many other songs in the album, especially \\"Legendary Lovers,\\" \\"birthday,\\" \\"walking on air,\\"unconditionally,\\" \\"this is how we do,\\" among many others!! I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to listen to a fun and enjoyable CD. Katy Perry has done it again!! And this is coming from a 20 year old guy!

0525423842|5.0|My son loves to read now! He enjoys mysteries in book more than TV thanks to this series! He read the book in no time.
1400032717|3.0|I laughed and had moments of worry and empathy. Although I enjoyed the perspective of this story, I was very disenchanted with the language. I was hoping to share the book with my children to give them some understanding of how some people think differently and view the world differently than they, but I won't be passing this along because of that. We loved the movie Temple Grandin for that purpose. It would have been easy to eliminate the language. Not everyone speaks that way. I've found, in fact, that most don't.
B00DW2PDH8|5.0|Luna Sanguis is a very fresh and delightfully unusual take on vampire lore. You are captured by the confused and traumatized mind of Eternal, while also seeing through the eyes of her other self, Rose. I have never seen anything written quite like this. The prose are very unique and feel real if you look beyond the fictional story. A great mystery and must read for vampire lovers.<br /><br />Looking forward to the rest of the series!<br />[[ASIN:B00DW2PDH8 Luna Sanguis (Luna Series Part1)]]
B0088EDMMS|5.0|If you don't like this movie, you have no soul!!! It's a timeless classic and yes, it may be a Halloween movie, but it's perfect to watch any time of the year.
1781162646|4.0|Interesting story. Not outstanding. The writing style of Stephen King is not at his best in this book. Would recommend, but don't pay full price- get at a thrift store!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This book made me wish I'd never started the Divergent series! Veronica Roth really dropped the ball with this book! So disappointing!

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have to say first thoughts were this just pain written porn. But in the short 24 hours that it took to read this first installment,  I was posses at the abrupt open ending. I want resolution. So on to the next with eagerness.

B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this in high school and I was blown away, had to pick it up before the movie let's hope it doesn't disappoint
B00CL6HGIK|4.0|Well it wasn't bad but I fell asleep during viewing which doesn't happen too often with his movies. It had some very good action and special effects and the plot was pretty good but was a little slow to develop in places.
B00AYJCEYC|4.0|Michael does a really nice job of adding his voice to some of these hits & enjoy the feature of a couple of people who join in. Nice listening.
B003U4UNPK|5.0|It is the best. The whole series is. Of is the acting that makes it. The acting is the best I have ever seen. The scenery is great. And the relationships are creative and real. It drew me in like no other show and I have never seen another show or movie that can compare in these respects.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|No spoilers, but I happened to watch this movie the day after watching Identity Thief.  There is a bizarre parallel in the two stories.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant.... you have broken my heart and made it joyous. The tears that flowed for joy, the tears that flowed for sadness. The triumph, the mistakes, the love. The truth of our own society so vivid. A wonderful read, suspenseful , and surprising.
B00AQA0OJG|5.0|Excelent Item, Nice details. I love it
B0015DROBO|3.0|Great story! Very engaging. Certain parts were a bit drawn out. I think that, while the girl was a relatable and realistic character, I thought she had too many masculine qualities, but I had to remind myself that I often find female characters in books written by men, to be this way.  Overall, I enjoyed the story!
B00FPH3YQA|3.0|I felt like I had to watch this one after seeing the first two.  It was a good movie, but definitely didn't live up to the level of the first or even the second.
0316055433|2.0|One of the values of being a \\"senior citizen\\" is this. Because the public knew that their young president, JFK, could read at amazing speeds, his eyes taking in huge chucks of words at one glance, the art of skim-reading became very much in vogue. I learned how but never used it much. But decades later I am pleased that I still have the ability to do so because for this so very, very overly-written novel, it has been the only way for me to plow through the 771 pages. And now I am hoping that I will find a novel such as the brilliantly edited \\"Someone\\" by Alice McDermott.<br /><br />Bennington College has a reputation for producing, per capita, an amazing number of published writers, Donna Tarff being one of them. I only wish she'd taken more courses in, say, \\"flash fiction.\\" This novel could easily have been reduced to 200 pages. And had it been, it would have been so much better. It is filled with unbelievable characters although the main character, Theo, and his mother are really well drawn. There are huge chunks of this \\"tome\\" (I actually wrote \\"tomb\\" and then changed it, a real Freudian slip I think) which have no value to the plot, or little. The scenes in Vegas should have been reduced by a tenth. And none of the characters are believable in that part. On second thought, there is absolutely no value in any of that large part. Ms. Tarff could easily have killed off the horrid father somewhere else. And the father's girlfriend, Xandra, is about the most god-awful silly soap-opera-ish creature.<br /><br />Theo has a stolen piece of art: that's the plot. What will happen to the piece of art? And the opening of the novel is the only reason--absolutely the only reason--I decided I would see just how fast my elderly eyes could race through the pages to see what happened to Theo who, as a late-twenty-something is holed up in the Netherlands. You know that nothing good is going to come of what has happened to him. By the way, he really didn't intend to steal the painting. And without the guidance of his mother, dead from an explosion in a museum where Theo, living through it, retrieves the work, he is left to figure out what to do with it.<br /><br />I too enjoy using the dash. And so did Emily Dickinson. But this author uses it so badly in places, annoyingly so.<br /><br />Fortunately I was able to purchase this novel at Amazon at a greatly reduced rate from the $30 retail listed price. Anyone want a very heavy free book you could use to practice your speed-reading skills?ng.

B0045HCIZY|4.0|I bought this as part of a Before Sunrise, Before Sunset, and Before Midnight movie marathon, now that they are all available. The quality of the film is a bit better than the first one. I think that whether or not you actually like the film is personal preference, but I'd name this as realistic romanticism.<br /><br />It's a great story! Perfect for a date or a girls' night!
B00992CF6W|5.0|As if I really needed another reason to be less productive in my life. That's it. That's all I have to say. Why is there a word minimum for reviews? But yeah, worth the money.

B000FCKRDI|5.0|I adore evie and I'm half in love with Sebastian! The descriptions of him are amazing. The perfect blend of perfection and villainy.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Breathtakingly beautiful, with words and phrases so deliciously, creatively crafted that you will want to taste them, chew on them, savor them, and suck every last morsel of meaning from their artful bones. It is humanity's startling amazingness, boiled down until just the essence remains, to burst into fragrant flavor in your heart. Take a bite, and then another, and it will be hard to put this book down!

B007SGM084|5.0|I loved the book. I don't read much but I tried these books based on my familys sugestions. I am so happy I read it I found out I really like stories like this. I read Darker and Freed in 2 days. I could not put it down. I have even started reading other series because of these books. I can't say enough about it. Oh I am rereading it again now.

1449305172|5.0|Maurya's Running Lean is one of the three treasured start up tomes on my shelf (Steve Blank's Start-up Manual and Ben Yoskovitz's Lean Analytics are the other two). It is clear, and action oriented. If you are starting a company, you should buy this book first.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Lzzy Hale and the boys have a great CD with a great bunch of tracks, There is no loser here except you, if you don't buy this CD. She howls and wails and sails to hit the high notes and crashes down to the low notes. Smile, and rock out with Lzzy Hale. You will not regret it.
B00A285OOW|3.0|Not as good as the white queen.Hit over the head too many times with Henry Tudor's bad temper, and his verbal abuse of Elizabeth.
0375842209|5.0|I feared this would be another tear jerker about Jewish people caught up in the Holocaust. It is much more. Germany had many other people living there. What were their lives like? It has been so far a most thought provoking book I have read in a long time. Well packaged. I have nothing to complain about.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is awesome.  It allows you to upgrade your weapons without having to purchase a lot of glu credits.  Very addicting,  can not put it down.

B009NQZVKG|4.0|Good book. Moves fast & keeps you interested. Typical Rollins action. If you are a Rollins fan you won't be disappointed.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This book was such a monumental letdown on almost every level. The storyline was jarring (sudden shift in location and characters) and boring to boot. Roth's decision to write the novel in alternating POVs is interesting in theory but not handled well because both Four and Tris are given the same voice. The ending was needlessly devastating and heavy-handed. If you've read the rest of the series, you will likely want to see how it all plays out, but I think you will be disappointed.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It makes you exercise your mind.<br />You have to remember things that you will use later. It makes you think.<br />Looking forward to new floors.
B00BQH9SY0|5.0|love every song.  Neighbourhood's music is as beautiful as they are. Sweater Weather will just put you in a great mood.
B00DDVPXTG|5.0|Good to be able to get several out of print CD's all in one.  This is the no frills approach - no extras, but to just have the music is worth the price.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|The reason why I love this app is because it is so fun but it is pretty wrong yet very funny to watch the consenqunces when your person dies. BTW when you get enough points watch the music video.
B003Y74KC0|3.0|When I first started using it I really liked the case, but the edges of it started to discolor within a couple of weeks.  I also felt the the fit around the edges was a bit too loose.  Loved it at first, but became disappointed after a while.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is great for teaching all kindest of stuff to your kids and not to mention it is very fun.
B00G8YVVYG|1.0|Content chosen for season 4 episodes 1-3 are uninteresting. Bad editing of bad materiel. Hyped up drama. Get back to being tactical. Mankind is doomed if this is the last group of humans.<br />Rick needs to get in the air with a Cessna airplane and scout around for Fort Benning. Get to an airport and take off in something. Break into a gun store and get lots of ammo and survival gear. Get with it and be like doomsday preppers. Did Herschal grow is leg back? lol<br />Season 4 episodes 1-3 we have seen before. You are disappointing you fan base as I type. Get off the touchy feely crap. Instinct for survival is what we want to see.<br />Oh yeah and flamethrowers too!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Chromecast is a great little device.  Using my Android Phone or iPad, I can easily look at Netflix, Hulu, etc while controlling from my device.  Simple to setup, easy to use.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I absolutely adored the first two books in this series. I loved reading the storyline and also appreciated Tris' journey/growth as a character.<br /><br />I was super pumped for this book...I pre-ordered it through amazon and started reading the first day. Instantly, I was turned off. Not only does it keep switching from Tris to Tobias but the tone of each character was EXACTLY the same so I had to keep trying to remember which character this chapter belonged to.<br /><br />Now that they finally escaped the fence, I was really hoping for some meat in the plot but it turned out to be incredibly boring...the government shutting people away to weed out the genetically damaged people and produce genetically pure ones. Blah blah blah. I am so terribly confused by this whole story after that fact came out. Why would they shut them up with no control? Scientifically standing, this makes no sense...you need to have direction and involvement in this sort of program but it seems like it is just a bunch of government people watching the people in the fence all day. Really? If you are talking about genetically pure vs genetically damaged in the sense that the pure people did not have alterations done (blue eyes, blonde hair, etc), this would never work the way it is portrayed in the book. Everyone keeps breeding with everyone and eventually genes will sort themselves out again...but this could be happening inside or outside the fence.<br /><br />Also, the government compound is in...what, O'hare airport? Uh huh...right. And then you have the genetically damaged people living in the outskirts of chicago, again with no oversight. So, again, the damaged genes gets pushed all together, breeding with each other, never truly solving the problem. I am so confused! I felt like there was NO POINT to this entire story now. Nothing got accomplished...especially since this is going on all over the country!<br /><br />Now back to Tris and Tobias; they flat-lined as a couple. Throughout 75% of the book, they were awkward and weird with each other. They either couldn't stop arguing or they would kiss for a moment and say something cheesy before running away from each other. If you are going to throw in a love plot in a book, you need to commit to it so that it works in line with the whole series. This third book left me feeling like Tris and Tobias barely knew one another.<br /><br />Finally, Tris dying. One of the most pointless and unremarkable deaths I have read in a long time (this third book is on par with Twilight writing). She, of course, steps in to release the memory serum and she beats the death serum but ultimately is killed by the government's leader (in a wheelchair). And then, nothing happens. Vision going black, oh, I see my mom, time to die. There was no time taken to expand or revolt against what happens to Tris. Her brother was right there...plus all of her friends had been sneaking around for days getting things set up and no one is around to help or kill David or something.<br /><br />Another thing, all this security and no one notices all these kids whispering in broom closets with maps and whatever else...I wanted to beat my head against the wall.<br /><br />And Tobias's mother...after YEARS and YEARS of trying to become who she eventually became, she just gives it up in a less than 2 minute conversation. Willy nilly, no big deal. Easy peasy man. Let me just put down my gun cause my son wants me to and I will give it all up. Definitely not the same woman in book 2.<br /><br />This book seemed really rushed...not only rushed but a panicked rushed. 'I gotta write this third book to finish the series which has taken off...movies being made...' The author fell so far short of finishing this series well that I am surprised the book even has three stars.<br /><br />As I was reading, I would find myself looking for anything else to do beside read it...first time that has ever happened. I will finish anything but this was almost painful tokeep reading. I was so disappointed. I hope they have some fan fiction come out for this series so I can read one of those endings instead to satisfy me.<br /><br />Boo, two thumbs down.<br /><br />Summary; book felt like it was written in a panicked, rushed state of mind. It was a disappointing and painful way to end the series. I really hope they take a second look when they decide to do this book in the movies.keep reading. I was so disappointed.

B00ELOOYZI|4.0|I found this to be a refreshing change to FAOTD. Fairly easy to play, rockets are always cool. It lets you interchange engines and fuel tanks and then you can see how well it will fly. I keep seeing though that the version I downloaded needs to be updated, Google play is version 1.44 and the Amazon version is 1.3. It would be nice to be able to download the up to date version to be able to use all the features.
1582406723|5.0|I give this book 10/10. This book if you do not know is the book that escalated Walking Dead's fame, for a good reason to! This Book is full of suspense and horror I highly recommend this if you are an adult that is into the horror but yet on the edge of your seat thriller.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Allegiant did not disappoint. Once you get into, you can't put the book down. Highly recommend this one and the previous books in the trilogy.
B00ARHAAZ6|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is amazing. His storytelling has a common theme throughout. The theme of his superb development of super humans using rules that are complex and intricate. His books create fictional worlds where those who seem powerful have great weaknesses. For every superman character, there is kryptonite. Read this and then go read everything else he ever wrote. You won't be disappointed.
B00D7NWTSI|5.0|Excellent movie!  However, the clean-up after the fight sequence happened too quickly.  I don't know if there will bve anymore Iron Man movies or if he'll only be in the Avengers' movies.  His last words were I am Iron Man??????
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This sequel does not disappoint. I enjoyed it tremendously and, fellow King fans, you will, too. King is a master.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Love it, keeps you guessing, very exciting! Can't wait to see the next two seasons episodes. Want it to go on forever!
B002RI9X8S|5.0|The book is an amazing, and beautifully written, account of the impoverished people working on drought-stricken land who are  forced - by big banks driving them off the land - and misleading leaflets offering the 'land of milk and honey' - to travel Route 66 to California.<br />Their journey is fraught with many hazards, tragedies and extreme hardship.<br />In California they are not welcome and competition for work is extreme - for every job there are 5 people!<br />The book is a brilliant account of a period in American history that should be understood to prevent such a situation arising again.<br />The resilience of the characters is amazing. It is a tribute to the very best people in society.
B0091REZMW|2.0|Senior here, unable to read the teeny tiny writing, then on a night quest have a hard time with only the flashlight.<br />I enjoy the game as I love searching for objects but really have a hard time with the dark screen.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|works perfect-I hope they keep the OMAP chip from TI in it.<br />Installation - was very easy, I highly recommend it
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book had so many twists.  Some of them I saw coming and some caught me by surprise.  I loved that Sky was a strong character and that the connection that she and Holder shared was able to endure.  I am looking forward to reading Losing Hope next!
B00BC5FN2C|5.0|I will keep this review very short as people have already covered how amazing and original this show is.<br /><br />I rented episodes 1-6 from Redbox Saturday and watched them ALL in one day!! It was that good and that addicting.  I had no intentions of having a 5 hour marathon viewing session but that is what happened.<br /><br />Sunday. I had plans.<br /><br />Monday...I was off work so I picked up the continuation (episodes 7-13) of the series and watched them ALL in one day!! Once again, I never thought I would be glued to the TV for 6 hours!!!!!<br /><br />Rent this or buy this if you love sarcastic type, great storytelling drama.  Best show since the Sopranos went off the air. Great job NETflix!!!!!
B009SKPVO8|4.0|I saw someone with a strap similar to this at the zoo, but didn't catch the brand before they walked away.  After some research I decided on this one, and I am impressed.  The shoulder pad is a little bulky, but it's great if you're carrying your camera around for some time (as I tend to). The camera moves very easily on it, and I'm never worried about it coming undone and falling to the ground when I let it hang just by the strap.  Overall I'm happy with my choice!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Just wanted to refresh my memory in preparation for the second movie. Reminded me how good the first movie was.
B002U1F32M|4.0|everyone is entitled to their own opinion and mine is that I really liked this movie. Yes, it's your standard boy meets girl flick but I think that Levitt and Deschanel play their parts well and with conviction. Everyone knows how it feels to be hopeful and then completely and utterly disappointed. Love (or a lack of love) is a funny thing...it always leaves it's finger prints on you.<br /><br />p.s. I also enjoy the music in this film.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Works great best investment ever!! The only thing is it doesn't have enough apps as of yet to do more with chromecast
B005IQZB14|5.0|I am not going to say much...but if you are a fan of Cheryl's(Sugar's) you'll love this book.  She had me engrossed in this book right away with her wit and charm. It's always nice to see someone shed in actual light (flawed and raw) that over come their obstacles (even if they are brought on heavily by them selves) and furthermore to do so with a sense of grace.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I love this game, but I have -2 billion some glu credits. Even though I got +3 credits it still says minus the same number it never goes down. I can't buy anything now.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Really liked this book. Had a few twists I didn't see coming. Thought the premise of the book was interesting

B0089LOG02|5.0|I really liked the book. I couldn't put it down. It was all that more interesting knowing it was part of our history.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I like the show about a woman trying to make the right decisions with everyone and tries to take care of everything that is thrown at her and at the end of the day accept everyone and take care of herself also.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|This little guy boosts and enhances your music a lot. Whenever it runs out of batteries (after about 10 hrs) its upsetting, since listening to music without it seems dull in comparison. I keep mine charged and use it every day. A must buy if you have quality headphones and what to hear them put out some serious volume and high quality sound. Otherwise you're missing out.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|It can't get any better than what it is and their is no blood so kids of every age can play, it's a good game to pass the time
B00E5Q1HJS|4.0|Great move, good price, not sure I really am totally down with digital delivery only however. Like the feeling of having the blu-ray in the video cabinet. I leave in the woods and internet download speeds can be sketchy.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Loved the different view points, twists, turns and assumptions that kept you wondering about what if?!  Best book I've read in a long while.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|I had the unfortunate experience of watching the first Dredd with Stallone several years ago.  This version which had a better storyline, was truer to the original story and characters and was way more intense blew the old version away.  Excellent movie with great effects ... Slo-Mo anyone?
0142501123|5.0|This book has been on my wish list for a while and I finally added it to a recent purchase as a last minute decision. I wish I had bought it sooner! My 3 year old son absolutely loves the story and the rhyming is fantastic. He loves to help read the story and it was easy for him to pick it up after only reading it a couple of times. Can't recommend enough and it's a great price!
B00B6CUO6Q|5.0|This is what great television is: a compelling story that is neither too sentimental or too overly dramatic. It is superb writing, the finest acting, exceptional cinematography and art design, gorgeous scoring, absolute perfection. I was skeptical about starting to watch this series, not being a fan of the Upstairs/Downstairs genre but was talked into trying it, so bought the first season DVD and was instantly hooked. Rapidly went through the entire series, and eventually my DVD player began to shows signs of aging. Bought a BluRay player and immediately replaced the DVDs with this entire series package. It was like watching it anew. The detail, color, and clarity are astonishing, everything from pores in the actors skin, to beads on dresses, to booktitles on shelves. So much detail, and so gorgeous. The scenery and sets are breathtaking.<br />Everyone else has gone into elaborate detail about Maggie Smith, Michele Dockery and company, so I  will leave it at get the BluRay version if you can, it's equisite!! A masterpiece of television!<br /><br />Be warned this is not the box set, but the three seasons being sold together.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Overall, this is a well made movie that appeals to the general movie going audience. Both Trek fans and non-Trek fans alike should be able to appreciate the appeal of an action packed Sci-Fi movie. I appreciate the fact that J.J. Abrams appeals to us Trek fans by keeping certain themes alive from Star Trek II like self-sacrifice for the benefit of others or a greater good, friendship, life/death, and constantly breaking the rules of an established semi-militaristic organization where you advance your career when your superior is murdered or incapacitated. Well, you get the idea. For you younglings out there, watch Star Trek II first, then you will understand this movie a bit more. It's slower, so you might want to watch it earlier in the day. Anyway, Star Trek Into Darkness (No colon anymore? What happened to good grammar?) is a fun ride!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Kept my attention the whole time. Advise reading the second book first. The first I just watched the movie. Loved the series!
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is a rock solid app that is easier to use than a traditional calculator for my fat fingers!<br />Great for little fingers too!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is awesome I love it. I would recommend it to everyone. I is definitely a good game for little children because it easy to play. My little brother plays it all the time and he loves it too. If you can get it get it. If you don't get it you will regret it.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|The game is fun and additive watch out you won't believe how time will fly while playing it. In its own way it is meditative.
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Best show on BBC right now.  I am so looking forward to the next season.  I can watch it over again and always catch something that I may have missed.  Very intriguing and exciting and funny at the same time.
B0090SI3EI|5.0|Fantastic movie, easily my favorite of all the Avengers tie-in sequels. Loads of action, but still with a sense of humor. Lots of twists as well. Some of them you will see coming if you're a comic fan, but many others will still surprise you. old school comic feel, but with a contemporary message. In particular I enjoyed the Winter Soldier. Think Anton Chigurn meets the Terminator. It's about time we have an awesome recurring villain besides Loki.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Before purchasing the book, I read about 50 reviews by very ticked off readers. I considered not even buying it, but decided I had already invested in two books, I might as well see what all the fuss is about. I'm glad I did. I didn't love the characterization. I felt like it was difficult, at times, to tell whether we were hearing Tobias or Tris. I think it's possible that she might have done that on purpose, and here's why I say that. Roth seems to have a very important point to make with this book. She uses the whole &#34;genetic deformity&#34; idea to show the reader just how alike and damaged we all are. She is pointing out that we CHOOSE our behaviors and our choices regardless of our backgrounds. We all have the ability to be heroes and villains. The two characters, though one is GD and one is &#34;pure&#34;, one is male and the other female, are alike in their humanity and struggle and love. Great authors don't just tell a story, they tell a story that reveals something about us and ultimately reveals something about humanity. Greater love hath no man than this, that he lay down his life for his friends. In this selfish, materialistic world, people need to see that real love doesn't always end the way we think it should. Love isn't selfish. Point well made Veronica Roth and I loved it.
B008JFUS5A|5.0|Just got back from a showing. Absolutely amazing movie. From beginning to end the action never lets up. Fantastic. The cinematography, the the acting, the writing, the special effects, everything was great. The movie absolutely lacked nothing. I love Hunger Games and Jennifer Lawrence is so talented in her masterful portrayal of the girl on fire. I'm only sad that the trilogy is now almost over.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This was the first book I have read from this author. It is a very good and quick read. I would highly recommend it.
1449305172|5.0|I think this book is a must read for any entrepreneur. It describes --step by step instructions-- how to move from an idea into a validated concept. Using this book drastically helped me with my own progress on a funded tech started which I founded. Maurya created a new business model canvas and describes the reason for recreating the traditional Business Model Canvas is that it ignored the number one reason why startups fail:<br /><br />\\"Most startups fail, not because they fail to build what they set out to build, but because they waste time, money, and effort building the wrong product. I attribute a significant contributor to this failure to a lack of proper \\"problem understanding\\" from the start.\\" ~ Ash Maurya<br /><br />Maurya has written an in-depth article describing the advantages of The Lean Canvas over The Business Model Canvas, which can be accessed here: [...] But this book walks an user through the validation stage and even supplies word-for-word interview examples. Cheers Ash.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Neil Gaiman is getting better if that is possible.<br />This is a story distiller to the essence, excellent writing by a master.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|If you weren't madly in love with Divergent or Insurgent, Allegiant probably isn't going to change your mind. If you loved the first two books, one of two things is likely to happen: you're going to feel like this is the perfect, inevitable ending to the trilogy, or you're going to hate it. I'll have a spoiler section in a bit to talk about the ending, but as for the major content of the book, this is what you'll get:<br /><br />1. More of an emphasis on ideas than action for the first 2/3. This doesn't mean nothing happens, but the tension comes from a different place than it does for most of first two books. This will bore some people quite a lot, but if you're like me, and you find questions about what motivates human behavior interesting, and you love to critically analyze where assumptions come from and how they become problematic, you might find this section fascinating, as I did. I love peeking over Roth's shoulder as she examines where humanity's aggression comes from and how we fool ourselves into thinking these answers are obvious.<br /><br />The fact that a YA book bothered to dig deeper into these complex situations without offering easy, parental answers is impressive--much of the recent YA I've come across struggles to deal with anything more than love triangles and supernatural powers. This careful consideration of what constitutes moral behavior digs deeper than the first two books. I liked the first two, but they were a little immature in the complexity of thought compared to this one. I see this as a pro, but as I said, if you don't enjoy this sort of reading, you might get bored.<br /><br />2. Struggles between Tris and Four. I love love love Tris and Four's relationship, and I have since the beginning. I loathe insta-love in books. It's stupid and immature and completely unrealistic, and I'm not a fan of love triangles either. Tris and Four have been better developed than that, and considering the state of things after Insurgent, it wouldn't be consistent or realistic if they didn't have some bumps here. I thought they were explored well for the most part, and Four's issues in this book were occasionally frustrating, but I always felt like his behavior was real and consistent with his character, despite the fact that he sometimes did things I didn't agree with.<br /><br />3. The resolution of the battle for the city and the exploration of the world beyond. This part is intriguing, although in a couple places it meanders a bit. New characters are introduced that, frankly, aren't nearly as interesting as the old ones, but they don't spend a lot of time in the forefront of the plot, so it isn't a big detraction. This part delves into the original development of the city and the factions and you'll learn about the vast conspiracy that set all of that up--and how it influences things for the better and worse now.<br /><br />Finally, the ending. SPOILERS follow, but mostly about theme and tone. I won't discuss specific plot points, but you'll probably be able to infer some content if you keep going.<br /><br />This series takes place in a dark world, and it's only getting darker. Characters are killed (think of how many died in Divergent alone), Tris and Four endure terrible grief and hardship, and the violence in these books is unflinching.<br /><br />That being said, I was kind of expecting this ending. It's true, the ending is not what I would call a happy one, but I do think it's the right one. Roth could have arranged things so that everything worked out perfectly and everyone lived happily ever after, but to be honest, that's the ending that would have made me angry. It doesn't fit the world or the characters, for one thing. There are so many dystopian YA books on the market that end just like that. They play it safe, and as a result, they're predictable and boring. I've read so many of them that they blend together at this point, and it takes a lot for a book, and a character, to have lasting resonance.<br/><br />Tragedy abounds in literature for a reason. Complicated endings keep a story in a reader's mind for a long time as we try to figure out why we had such a strong reaction to the events in the book. It forces us to be engaged, to respond, and to think. The ending to Allegiant is beautiful, meaningful, and perhaps most important, consistent with the themes, characters and world that this series is set in. It isn't an easy ending or a fun one, but it's real, and far more adult than most YA I've read. I won't be forgetting Tris or the journey I've been on or the way this has made me think anew about what it means to be strong. If the ending were different, some of that power would have been lost, and Tris and Four and this story deserve to be remembered.
B008S4YZCO|3.0|The game looks great, The monsters are original looking and I like how you can interact with them. That being said, There are quite a few bugs in the game and it has already crashed twice on me. I think once they fix the bugs, It'd easily be a 5 star game. Well worth checking out.
B003G4W49C|3.0|The concepts and story line were interesting enough, although the character development seemed a bit rudimentary. Mr Card is also not the most descriptive of writers and seems to rely perhaps a bit too much on the reader's ability to mentally paint their own scenes for him.  The writing is simple enough to read very quickly.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I am very grateful that you heard our cries for the game. I love it. just one issue. when you switch 2 wrapped candies it should blow up a whole lot more. can you fix this minor detail? thank you
1439102813|5.0|This book was amazing!  As an adult child of a parent who is experiencing many of these same struggles I feel so much more in touch with her.  The descriptions were so detailed and real.  I am so happy to have the added insight into her daily struggles that this book provided me.  I encourage everyone who has older parents who are struggling (whether diagnosed or undiagnosed) to read this book and find a deeper understanding of those you love.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You have to watch this it is great I have become upsessed with this show and i normally don't get interested in shows/movies. So this is worth your time so, Shiney lets be bad guys.
B00ESY7QXI|5.0|I just watched the Great Gatsby with Redford and enjoyed it.  This new one with Leonardo was great!  I loved the special effects....looked so real and helped 'glam' it up a lot more than the older one.  Plus, I love how Leonardo looks in this one:)
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Use this on my multi tools, knifes, etc etc. It is in the shop with all the tools hanging on the wall with in reach to put a few passes on cutting tools as needed.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|In reading the first novel, my expectations were not very high.  I was pleasantly surprised though because this novel was a billion times better.  The relationship between Ana and Christian is extremely interesting because in such a short period of time, two people have become not only close intimately but also on a personal level.  The transition of their relationship was the best part of the novel for me.  Ana's boss, Jack, genuinely creeped me out.  I was definitely happy when Ana stood up for herself and gave him what for in their break room, he really did deserve it after all.  The ending - well a couple pages before the very end - is so absolutely perfect.  It really made me start to understand why people have been so obsessed with the trilogy.  I was a bit confused though by the ending.  I think I know who was speaking (Jack?), but I'm not quite sure.

0545586178|4.0|Great story! A fast read, but make sure you read the first book of the series (the hunger games) first!
B000PC0S5K|5.0|If you have not read this book, you MUST buy it NOW!!! You will be awakened and therefore live the most ultimate life. I have read countless books on spirituality; the bible, the Torah, the Tao te Ching, the Bhagavad Gita, and countless others. A New Earth is so simply written that there is no getting lost in translation or interpretation. You will easily understand the concepts and actually experience awakening while reading this book. Your life will be changed forever!

1250038820|5.0|As someone who used to live in NY and work in NYC, it's nice to see all the people and places in this book.<br /><br />Seeing all the random people, (and even in your everyday life - no matter where you live) it's always something that you wonder.  &#34;What is his life's story&#34; or &#34;I wonder what's on their mind?&#34;<br /><br />This is an entertaining mix of imagery and answers some of your wonderings.  And leaves you wondering more.  What I like is that it also reminds me that everyone has a different perspective, different burdens that weigh them down.  For me, it helps to remind me to not be harsh and judge people.<br /><br />I love this book :)  And I highly recommend it!
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I read this book on my iPad and was inspired by Steve Jobs genius and distraught by his treatment of family. I used to be a PC guy, but now appreciate the simply beauty of the spectrum of Apple products. The writing flows easily, and it makes me feel as if I knew Jobs. We are fortunate to live in a time when we benefit from Apple and Jobs contribution to the meld of art and technology.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I really thought this was going to do the job for what I needed it for but, it did not. The messages do come and go, they are not consistent with what is playing as an example: watching videos. It starts ok, then goes away and then come back. I have used it once and have not tried it again.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Once again I bit and bought an album/CD off of hearing one song and man am I glad I did. When both the male and female leads sing it is awesome. One of my favorite groups, can;t wait for the next CD to come out.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I liked the way she wove the story,  at first a little hard to follow the characters, but once learned it was a terrific read!  Unpredictable, which Zi like.  As an avid reader sometimes I guess the conclusion, so lose enthusiasm for the book.  Not so with this book. A good read. Thanks Liane!!!
B00B89WXYS|5.0|I bought this because I heard one song on the radio that I liked. I've been burnt doing that before but not this time. One Republic has quickly become one of my favorites.
B00BEIYMIS|5.0|this one keeps you alert  to see what is happening next. and seeing its actually based on a true story makes it even more intense. will need to watch again to see what I missed the first time around  lol great movie
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I must say it is refreshing to have a group put out cd after cd and maintain the say high level of music.
B00985E3UG|5.0|it is interesting, and gives you good information to think about  it gives us tools to arm ourselves with when making choices
B005GFPZYK|5.0|I love the book. I wish he could have written more about some of the left out stuff he was a part of but other than that it was a great read. Chris Kyle was a true American Hero and did not deserve the untimely death by a cowardly miscreant slug who should rot in hell for the dastardly act he committed.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|There were a few songs that caught my attention so I purchased the CD, what a great album!  Lots of great tunes!

B000035Z3K|5.0|Liguosi's portrayal is spot on.  His quite, yet intense stare is unsettling!  What is on his mind? What is coming next? Manners and civility sometimes had a real monster.  Liguosi is the only true Dracula.
