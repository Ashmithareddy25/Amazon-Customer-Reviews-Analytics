B003BVK36Q|3.0|When he is on target, there is no one to beat John le Carre for sharp, atmospheric writing.  His exchanges between characters, especially the conversations between the deceiving and the deceived, have been developed by him into something approximating an art form.  When le Carre chooses to give a master class in this form of writing, it is the closest thing I have found to readers' heaven.  There are snatches of this in A Most Wanted Man, the mystery and the despair come through strongly at times, but the story does not really hang together as well as his classic tales of the Cold War.  It is a clever move to set this book in Germany, the scene of so many of his other espionage dramas, but this time the bad guys come from both the east and the west and in the war on terror, there is no place to hide.  There are a few memorable characters but they get lost in a plot populated by too many walk on parts.  The complicated story line, although very topical today, leaves the reader racing to the end without fully understanding what has been traded away to satisfy the shadowy figures who emerge, calling all the shots.
B004HO6HWA|5.0|I was very impressed with the action and the storry line. As always it was a fun movie with alot of action. you will not be sorry if you get film. It keeps you on the edge of seat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B000FC1MM8|4.0|I Started reading the Harry Bosch Series by accident actually read Black Ice first and loved it then went back and read the first book. Just finished the last cayote and I loved it didn't dissapoint.
B008XNPO20|5.0|UPDATE: My first copy of the LP was unlistenable. Both discs were warped, with the first disc more warped than some of the worst abused used records I've seen at Goodwill. I returned it to Amazon, who promptly sent me a replacement copy (great customer service there). The replacement copy is far better, however, the second disc has a slight warp, but not enough to warrant returning it again.<br /><br />As for the album itself, many of the reviews posted here do a far better job than I could. I think this is a natural evolution of Parker's sound and songwriting. He keeps his distinct guitar style, and the drums sound blissful with the same quality of engineering found on Innerspeaker (just the right amount of compression, and ADT). But the addition of synths and keys make for a more progressive sound in a great way. So far the album feels less psychedelic than Innerspeaker in the sense of studio trickery, even though its there in spades. To me that speaks to the strength of Parker's songwriting and his ability to produce a product that is a cohesive whole. I look forward to what he'll do next. I am curious what a Parker project would sound like produced outside of his home studio or in isolation, but suspect that's part of the formula for his success.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|This is a must have for anyone who wants to enjoy their kinect to it's full potential, but have limited space to use it in.  You can get VERY close to the kinect and it registers your body and face perfectly.  I rarely use it since I do have a large space, but when I travel I also bring my xbox with me and this is very useful to have in small hotel rooms where the play space is limited.
B0061IMJBI|4.0|Wow, great series.... I have continued to watch all of Season 2 and look forward to Season 3 next week.<br />I'm on the edge of my seat.... love it. Have it on my Kindle to re-watch, again n again.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I bought this for my dad for his birthday. It arrived in quick succession, quality condition, and he enjoyed it. As for the movie, itself, my parents and I went to see it in theaters. We enjoyed it very much and it led to my father and I reading the book series. It had action, romance, and sci-fi, what's not to love? I admit that there are mistakes, but it makes the movie endearing, rather than boring. The changes to the movie are interesting in a way that prevents the story from falling flat, and I was able to follow the story fairly well. Overall, a movie worth buying.
B0090XOJAA|5.0|This is Mika's third official album and even though at first like many I was a bit skeptical at this CD. However, after listening to the CD through its entirety, I have to say Mika has done it again! This time with a different spin to his CD. Like the first two albums, the creativity, artistry, and uniqueness of each song bring out the versatility of Mika. Nothing sounds alike, yet the sound is still original to his style. Origin of Love is in its own way quite meaningful on so many levels from lyrics to musicality. Emily, an English version of Elle Me Dit, is quite playful yet packed a punch in making you pushing that replay button over and over again. Underwater and Overrated are quite ... underestimated and overrated, they are the must listen songs. Popular Song is an interesting take of Mika's rendition of the \\"popular\\" song from Wicked. While Heroes and Celebrate are the two songs that end the album on a high note. Lola, Stardust, and Step with Me are the other songs that I have no word to describe. From the delux CD, L'Amour Dans Le Mauvais Temps and Un Soleil Mal Lune are two great songs for even a person with no French comprehension. I love the music and the emotion listening from those two songs! All in all, this is a must buy CD!

0316227706|5.0|I was beyond excited to receive this book after pre-ordering several months ago.  The first time I saw the underwater picture of the silly black lab, Duchess, I was hooked on Seth Casteel photography.  He does amazing work and I am thrilled at the quality of the pictures in this book.  The images of these dogs underwater are beautiful and often hilarious.  If you want to make a dog person smile and laugh, get this book.  You and they will not be disappointed.  I am going to buy many more copies to give to family and friends.  Well done, Seth Casteel.  I hope there will be more to come!!!

0061537969|5.0|I absolutely adored this book.  I actually  happened to read it because a friend's friend had posted on their Facebook page they loved it.  I hadn't heard of the book before, now I am a disciple, telling everyone about it.  It helps that I love dogs, and even like car racing.  It's obvious that Garth Stein has lived with dogs too, I don't think you could put yourself into the head of a dog without having been surrounded by one.  I was reading this book on my kindle while on a trip and read lots of it out loud to my husband.<br /><br />Beware of the evil Zebra!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Do not read this book if...<br /><br />1) You don't like reading books involving a compelling protagonist who legitimately earns your adoration and respect by being relatable, three-dimensional and human.<br /><br />2) You don't like an interesting world being fully explored.<br /><br />3) You don't like books where the supporting characters feel like they have actual personalities and a sense of independence and are NOT just one-dimensional cut-outs whose only purpose is to share lines of dialogue with the main character and not be interesting in their own right.<br /><br />4) Have a problem with excitement, tension and so on.<br /><br />5) Don't like good writing.<br /><br />6) Consider Twilight a hard read (Not because of bad writing where you would literally struggle to actually understand what was written because it wasn't written well but because you found it too heavy).<br /><br />7) Think science fiction has to be stupid.<br /><br />If, however, the seven aforementioned things don't apply to you. Run don't walk to this book. Read it from first page to last. Let it rock your world.
B009D0LBRO|4.0|Played on 1st generation Kindle Fire.<br /><br />The game is definitely fun, but short in length. I completed all levels/bonus in slightly longer than one hour.<br /><br />It should feel familiar to anyone who has played \\"Rayman Origins\\".<br /><br />The only problem encountered was graphical slowdowns on several levels where multiple animations are happening (mostly bonus levels), but that did not ruin the fun.
B00006G8G1|5.0|This is without a doubt the best concert video I have ever seen. The fast camera action is a little to get used to, but the sound and video quality more than makes up for that.

B008GVD6D8|5.0|Reflected in You was sinfully sexy and deliciously dirty while also being so filled with emotion that my eyes were constantly leaking, releasing the excess feelings from me so that I could keep reading. I felt so much for Eva and Gideon and their struggles. And even though for every two steps forward they'd take, there was always one step back, they're still headed in the right direction. The last couple chapters were nothing short of amazing. My heart is still fluttering in my chest.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|This is one book I could not put down without extreme discipline.The story line flows so well and it leaves you wanting to turn the page to see what is happening next.  The characters are so real and you want most of them to win. The history lesson is learned without you even realizing it. It is a great experience.

0307948110|3.0|I would not rank this book much above the category of \\"entertainment fodder\\" other than to say it does mention the fact that the majority of stock exchange transactions are simply bets, and that the profits made are based on no tangible value until settled with liquid assets.  This book serves as a warning against automated stock trading and is a statement of how hopelessly dependent the world economy has become on speculation and short-term profit objectives.<br /><br />I was going to give this book three-and-a-half stars with the final half star being added because of the message contained in the story, but then I took the half star away because of some basic inaccuracies in the author's descriptions of the less sophisticated technology involved.
0316228532|1.0|Wow.  I loved her writing with HP and was really looking forward to her new effort.  Unfortunately, she seems to equate \\"adult fiction\\" with the idea that it must contain disgusting language, images and people.  It's an insult to the reader.  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.  Save your money.
B007FEFLTO|2.0|I am so disappointed with this book. Book 1 introduced some wonderful, believable people. But the 2nd book continued on with their children and another War. This is beginning to sound like a history lesson instead of a novel. I think Follett does a lot of research before he writes and this helps bring his subjects to life, but this book is beginning to sound like a repeat of the last one, only the names have changed.<br />I'm not too sure if I'll even buy the third book.

B007S3S8HO|3.0|This review is based upon my 13-year-old daughter's assessment of the product.<br /><br />First impressions:<br /><br />This looks like it could be a lot of fun. I love Angry Birds, so I can't wait to test it.<br /><br />Directions:<br /><br />The directions are a bit lacking. It wasn't always easy to tell how many blocks needed to go together. I liked all of the pictures as it made it easier to determine what was needed for each section. The pictures themselves were clear and easy to read.<br /><br />Assembly and Play:<br /><br />This is where things started to go downhill. While I do think this set will be durable in the long run, the pieces fall apart way too easy which makes playing with the set difficult after the assembly takes place. Yes, the Angry Birds (which are really cute in this set) are suppose to knock everything over, but when it falls over before you're able to do anything, it defeats the purpose of the set.<br /><br />Final Thoughts from my daughter:<br /><br />The idea of the set is really neat, but it needs a few tweaks to make it really work as intended. Even though it had some issues, I still liked playing with the Angry Bird characters. I think I may use some of the pieces with some Legos to achieve a better working set.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I've been a Mumford fan for years now and I anxiously awaited the release of Babel. It was well worth the wait. Love every single song on well worth the money and the wait.
B003B2H3MC|5.0|Considering the age of the original film, I thought this transfer was excellent both in video and audio.  I bought this blu-ray version because it was in widescreen format.  I do not like full screen versions of movies that were filmed in widescreen.  I grew up reading about the exploits of Prince Valiant in the comic section of the Sunday newspaper.  This movie brought back a lot of old memories.
B008Y1YFNU|5.0|Sorry I am a little late on the review, but I wanted to listen to the entire record to give it a fair shake.  I didn't realize I would listen to it over a dozen times back to back to back.  WOW!!!  I am a HUGE PAPA ROACH fan from way back, but this record may be their GREATEST!!  I was extremely NERVOUS after viewing the video for the single, \\"Still Swingin'.\\" I was very SCARED and HUGELY disappointed.  After hearing the entire album, I am HAPPY to say I was SO WRONG!!  Jacoby lets the audience into his troubled and crumbling real life by penning some of his BEST work to date. The production on this record is AMAZING as well, considering it is being released on ELEVEN SEVEN RECORDS. Jerry lays down some of his heaviest and most melodic riffs to date.  The sound on this record is absolutely HUGE!!  This shows how well PAPA ROACH continues to deliver AWESOME true to form tracks and yet isn't left in the past re-hashing records filled with \\"Broken Home\\" and \\"Last Resort\\" sound-a-likes. One of the few bands that stays TRUE to their roots yet evolves with the music of the day. \\"Were Did The Angels Go\\"  \\"Walking Dead\\" \\"What's Left Of Me\\" and \\"9th Life\\" are my FAVORITE tracks.  Be glad YOU got the DELUXE record to get the two BONUS tracks....two of the BEST tracks on the record!!  It would have been TOTALLY INSANE if the U.S. deluxe release also included \\"Set Me Off\\" as well, but even without the Japanese BONUS track, this record totally KILLS!! If you are into \\"nu\\" rock and LOVE the edgy hard rock records Papa Roach has delivered in the years past, I am sure you won't be disappointed!!  This ONE is INSANE!!!! A MUST for any PAPA ROACH FAN for sure!!!
B007THA4FI|5.0|This was a great book. 5 stars.<br />It pulls you in. Not like the harry potter books at all but still great.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|As stated in my title, the only word I could come up with was \\"unneeded\\". And I am an AVID scifi fan as well as a HUGE supporter of remake/sequel/prequel modernizing of predetermined storylines. There was alot that couldn't be done in the originals of almost ALL the epic and genre setting scifi films, which took away alot from the experience. Such films as the Star Wars Saga, the Aliens Quadrilogy (which is also associated and tied into the Predator franchise and storyline now), the Terminator Story Arc and just about anything else that was mind blowing 22 years ago or more is now just a joke compared to modern film. Characterization in scifi genre'd films is richer and more colorful now, not to mention the visualizations and music scores almost acting as main characters to the films themselves. You will never find ANYONE who supports modernizing a project more than me!!!<br /><br />With that said, this film couldn't have been any further off the mark. Charlize Theron phoned it in (or I hope so, because she was worse in this than she was in \\"The Astronaut's Wife). The accent of Noomi Rapace was so thick, I couldn't understand 90% of what she was saying. Scott tried WAY TOO HARD to wedge this story to fit one or two stories away from the original Alien, so much so that he lost all traction with what started out to be a very original story! I won't get into the canon mistakes that were made when the story is held up against the 4 previous Alien films and the 2 Alien vs Predator films, but needless to say, there were ALOT mistakes(if you go against canon, you start to erase the story, and you WILL lose fans that way, which is obviously what is happening here).<br /><br />You should definitely give this movie atleast one watching. It is very entertaining (albeit predictable as all hell), and just visually STUNNING!!! It has some suspense. VERY GRAPHIC surgical scenes (which I could not watch). It's good to have under your belt, especially if you're like me, and want to have ALL CANON locked into your brain. I honestly hope that they go through with making the next film (which they leave it open for) to fill in as the OFFICIAL Alien prequel. Maybe gapping some of the time that seemed to be lost somewhere in the stories.have ALL CANON locked into your brain.

B007712XAU|5.0|Downton Abbey Season 1 and 2 are some of the best programs every produced.  I can't wait for Season 3.  The Episodes are so good that I watch them over and over.  I love the story line.  It is fascinating. I purchased Seasons 1 and 2 for my Kindle Fire.  I purchased Seasons 1 and 2 on disc so I can watch them on TV.  And I purchased the Collector's Edition of Seasons 1 and 2 to keep for my collection.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I found this to be a very cool, calming game.  It helps me to unwind at the end of the day.
B0041KKYEM|5.0|Excellent film. The combination of ballet and an exploration of destabilization was a great combination. Recommend this for people who enjoy dance, and also the psychological aspects of performance.
B005HEVVAM|5.0|Primary Takeaway<br /><br />Seven of Nine is Star Trek: Voyager's MVP, so I would say about 80% of the time when an episode comes along that features her, it will usually turn out to be a keeper. `Imperfection' is very much a great episode, as it puts Seven in the position of tackling aspects of her human side that she'd rather keep buried (this concept has worked before in episodes like `One' and `Infinite Regress').<br /><br />The backbone of the episode is Seven confronting her own mortality. Her cortical node is burning out (a device in her skull that keeps her Borg implants in check with her fleshy side) and without a new one soon, she'll die. The episode is a highlight real of great moments as Seven deals with her \\"imperfection,\\" searches for any meaning to her brief life as an individual, and is reassured by members of the crew that she has impacted everyone on Voyager.<br /><br />Fantastic episode. Don't skip it.<br /><br />Positive Points<br /><br />- Jeri Ryan. It's easy to hate on a girl in the skintight catsuit, but Ryan once again shows she is so much more then her character's shameless taste in wardrobe. Her scene with Dawson is powerful stuff.<br /><br />- Manu Intiraymi as Icheb. The kid has chops and they finally show.<br /><br />Negative Points<br /><br />- Voyager as a shuttle vending machine. The Delta Flyer was destroyed in the last episode, but Voyager has an infinite supply of raw materials to make another one.<br /><br />- More angry aliens who love space debris. They're most likely angry because they love space debris.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I considered it the best book I've ever read until I got to the end. The ending should have been completely different
0060920084|2.0|I enjoyed reading other works by Bill Bryson, and as someone who has had a chance to drive many parts of back-roads America on business, I had higher hopes for this book, and wanted to enjoy it.  But as noted by other reviewers, Bryson comes off in this work as a curmudgeon rather than a humorist.  His attitude comes off as that of a \\"conservative's\\" pejorative stereotypes of an elitist, stuck-up \\"liberal\\" far too good for the likes of Wal-Mart, Gatlinburg, tourist attractions, buses, motels, fast food, and the like.  What others may find rural wilderness, he calls \\"bleak,\\" \\"depressing,\\" and \\"lonely.\\"  I have been to many of the locales Bryson visited, many at roughly the same time as his 1980s tour (Beaufort, Bloomsburg, Mackinaw City, etc.), and I came away with much different impressions of the same places he describes--most likely because I actually interacted with an area and its occupants as an equal, not passing through hastily as a \\"foreigner\\" even though I have a bit of an accent.  My cynical impression is that those who find Bryson's travelogue humorous to the point of laugh-out-loud share a similar disdain for \\"flyover country\\" and its occupants, whereas those who live, work with, and even enjoy \\"America's heartland\\" will find this book disconcerting or depressing at best and insulting or offensive at worst.  Worse, the feel of the book is that of someone setting off to tour the country just to write a book about it, not of someone taking a trip to see the country for its own sake.
0525952926|1.0|The book focused more on lining all conservatives as pure evil and all liberals as godly, then to tell the story of what happened. It didn't even attempt to be objective, so it's difficult to tell what's fact and whats fiction. I'm in the middle in terms of politics and was disappointed in the turn this book made. The line \\"it's amazing my father is willing to help a black child, even though he's a conservative is amazing.\\" Really? It's a shame he ruined the story by forcing his hate for the right, instead of what actually happened.
0451196716|5.0|About:<br />Whenever I start reading a King book, I have high expectations. I'm happy to say my favorite author delivered here yet again.<br /><br />The Long Walk is an annual event that begins on each first of May in Maine. One hundred teenage boys are made to walk on a stretch of road for hundreds of miles and through several states. If anyone slows to under four miles per hour they get a warning and after three warnings they are shot dead. Who is in charge of all this? A man called the Major. When does the Long Walk end? When there is one person left standing he will win the Grand Prize, which means he will have whatever he wants for the rest of his life. There is no established finish line and no stopping of any kind. If anyone stops for more than 30 seconds, first warning is issued. Each walker is not to receive any outside help either. Armed guards follow the boys on trucks on the side of the road, gauging their speed with computers.<br /><br />This national sport is televised and as the boys walk, spectators can be seen on the sidelines cheering them or just staring at the gruesome sight. As The Walk progresses and there are fewer and fewer left standing, the crowds get bigger and wilder.<br />As the boys walk, the soldiers provide them with canteens full of water anytime and food packets at 9am each morning. These are the same armed guards who shoot them.<br /><br />The protagonist is 16 year old Raymond Davis Garraty from Maine. While Garraty walks, the few boys that are walking with him become friends to him. Peter McVries, Arthur Baker, Hank Olson, Collie Parker and a few others start to refer to themselves as The Musketeers.<br /><br />My thoughts:<br />Stephen King has said that The Long Walk is the first novel he ever wrote and he started it eight years before Carrie was published.<br />I was surprised to find that this book is a bit dystopian in nature. It takes places in the near future where America is ruled by the police, not the government.<br /><br />Garraty's inner monologue gives insight into his good nature. As he walks, he wonders if he can win this whole thing but at the same time he doesn't want to see his friends die. The thought of seeing his girlfriend and his mom again is what keeps him going. He does wonder what he will do when he finally sees them in the crowd. What else will he have to look forward to after that?<br /><br />He and McVries become best friends on The Walk and it's interesting to see these two help each other out because essentially, only one can win.<br />The Walk is gruesome in itself. It's a sad, hopeless scenario. As can be expected some of the boys go insane while others suffer illnesses that eventually lead to death. Endurance is key, mental as well as physical. While they walk, the boys talk about life and the reasons why they signed up for what is basically suicide.<br /><br />The characters are all well written, I think that's a given with King. Garraty and McVries were my favorites.The police, are always there, a menacing presence. As is usual with King, here is the struggle of good verses evil. There is symbolism within the story. I think the walk itself represents the human condition, the journey we all take. Each person is different, each struggles in different ways.<br /><br />\\"They walked on, somehow in step, although all three of them were bent forever in different shapes by the pains that pulled them.\\"<br />p.358,  The Long Walk<br /><br />Another thing I noticed while reading is the similarity to reality tv within the storyline. We've got shows like Survivor and Amazing Race where the contestants become reality tv celebs. The boys in The Walk become celebrities as well, with the bloodthirsty crowd cheering them on, making banners and chanting their names.<br /><br />The storyline is so intense, as I read I was on the edge of my seat, I could almost hear the walkers footsteps on the blacktop. King drew me in completely.<br />He takes the act of walking, and turnsit into this gripping and emotional story. Masterful storytelling as per his usual. I could not put this book down, especially towards the end and I even dreamt about it. It invaded my sleep.<br /><br />I wound up reading the last chapter twice because the ending left me stunned. If you've read this one, let me know how you interpret the ending. It's by no means a cliffhanger, but I do think it's up to interpretation. I found myself so drawn in, some of what happens at the end left me misty eyed. That's another thing King has a knack for, writing about the strong bonds of friendship. Friendships that form in the most unlikely of places.<br /><br />I recommend The Long Walk to any King fan and to readers looking to get caught up in a scary read that will completely suck you in and leave you stunned.<br /><br />\\"They walked through the rainy dark like gaunt ghosts, and Garraty didn't like to look at them. They were the walking dead.\\"<br />p.349, The Long Walkit into this gripping and emotional story. Masterful storytelling as per his usual.

0525953728|3.0|I purchased this book expecting an exciting action/thriller novel based on fact. It is not a thriller. At least in the sense that you can not put it down once you start reading it. However, it is a good book and it is written more as a documentary. It is kind of like a diary written by the author. I have always respected and admired the \\"Seals\\" for what they are able to do and this is an insight into the daily life of a Seal team member more than a entertaining \\"thriller\\", but, don't discount it for that. It is a good book and an interesting and informative read well worth the purchase price.

B003EVFHYG|5.0|In my opinion this is one of the best examples of an incredibly well done film score.<br />In addition to delivering perfect emotional ques during the high impact scenes, the whole sound reflects the film's lighthearted, happy-go-lucky feel.<br />I listen to this score just about every day, as music that doesn't always demand your attention and is still fascinating.<br />\\"Forbidden Friendship\\" is probably the best piece of score I've ever heard, even among the more iconic songs from Lord of the Rings, Star-wars and the more modern action films.<br />Frankly this score is more interesting then a lot of mainstream radio singles.<br /><br />100% recommended.

That said, I bough Push and Shove the day it came out and I've since listened to this album multiple times since getting it and still, it hasn't grown on me yet. Which I thought was weird. Because usually, with good albums, by the fourth or fifth listen, I have several (more than 2) tracks I love and I continue listening to the album over and over.<br /><br />Not so much the case with this one. Most of the songs sound like they were rejects from Gwen Stefani's last solo album. And indeed, as others have said, the stand out star of this album is the title track \\"Push and Shove\\". I also really enjoy \\"Settle Down\\" but that's about it. The rest of the songs are boring and incredibly lackluster. And I know, I know, this isn't 1995 anymore or even 2001 (Rock Steady is my personal fave of the band.) and I know bands evolve and change and blah, blah, blah. But I really think that this album was kind of just thrown together, or at least that's how it feels when listening to it.<br /><br />I guess my suggestion to others thinking about buying this is, save your money and download a copy from a friend.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I like all the options available....entering in notes, underlining, highlighting. I use this to get my studying done on the train. Love it!
B0095R64AO|4.0|I love Jason Segal and Emiky Blunt. Having lived in te snow I could relate to his transformation to a northerner. It was true to the movie, made me laugh out loud. Also who doesn't love a good love overcomes all story. I do!!
1609611543|5.0|Dr Davis does a masterful job of explaining the problems with genetically modified wheat in addition to addressing the under diagnosed Celiac disease.  His eye opening book confirmed my own suspicions about wheat and my own body.  I would recommend this book to anyone who is in charge of feeding a family or raising children.  Also I think this information should be presented in medical school.  Our government probably will not be much help in bringing about awareness though as it is big business behind the genetic modification of our food.
B00493E1GI|4.0|[[ASIN:B00493E1GI Eat Pray Love]]Eat Pray and Love movie is entertaining. If you are the type of person that likes to fantasizes about the What ifs.... On life you will like it. It takes a lot of courage to just take of when one is not happy with their current situation, and this is what Julia R. Did on this movie. I saw myself in this movie. The book is better because it allows to see visualize the scenes the way one will like it.
B009G8GRX6|5.0|The 2nd Law is an exquisite treat, and listening to it puts a smile on my face. The creativity exhibited on this album is dynamic to the point of being brilliant. Muse has a really stellar command over melodramatic soundscapes, and The 2nd Law takes these established tendencies and launches them into new realms. The music is often synth-heavy, but not to its detriment at all. Follow Me is an example of a highly synthesized track that really pulls me in. Guitars are utilized playfully and stylistically, generally enhancing the music rather than driving it. And that's all good by me.<br /><br />The first time I listened to this album, I was struck by how much fun I was having. Panic Station and Survival were two tracks in particular that made me grin ear to ear whilst simultaneously getting my blood pumping. These tracks could rightfully be called \\"cheesy\\" but there's more to it than that. It is like Muse has mastered cheesiness to the point that it's not cheesy anymore. It's more like \\"intentional melodrama overdrive\\" than cheese. It works for me. Survival is going on my 5K playlist and I'll run my happy little head off to it without an ounce of shame.<br /><br />I think that the reason I have so much fun listening to The 2nd Law is because Muse sounds like they had fun making it. In my eyes, their experimentation and playfulness has paid off bigtime.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|Filled with spoilers because buying/watching this was annoying.  I know my bar for Ridley Scott is high, but considering you'll see his name or ScottFree at least 10 times before the movie starts, I think a high bar is fair. LOL.<br /><br />Blu-Ray - 1 takes forever to load.  I'm talking 4-5 minutes of black screen after the Blu-ray may take a while warning.  Loaded Avengers = 10 seconds.<br /><br />Supposed to connect with Alien - So explain why the \\"Engineer\\" doesn't die in the pilot's seat as shown in the first 15 minutes of Alien.  The \\"mama\\" Alien barely looks like Aliens.  I'm not one to be nit-picky but seriously I don't think the screenwriter and/or effects designers have watched Alien.<br /><br />The robot - Seriously, \\"Data\\" from Star Trek without the silver makeup but with pink lipstick instead.<br /><br />Rich Guy - makeup, think Old Biff from Back to the Future.  I think they just reused the mask.<br /><br />I think other reviews have hit on other points.<br /><br />Ships Captain - (probably the best supporting character) a black man who carries a squeeze-box from Crosby, Stills, Nash and sings their songs. Ugh!<br /><br />Charleze Theron - Rich Girl In-Charge - has a medical bay that is only for males.  \\"I didn't come 2 years away from Earth to get laid... Come to my room in 10 minutes to get laid.\\" Nuff-said!<br /><br />A spaceship that is 2+ years away from Earth with a \\"lifeboat\\" that doesn't fly.  Guess what ... the Alien is on the lifeboat.  So maybe they watched enough of Alien/Aliens to go for a recurring theme.<br /><br />The mapping team that leaves first but is the only pair to get lost. I swear I thought that guy was Jason Sidekis? from SNL.<br /><br />A genetic poison that is used by the robot to make Alien sperm that impregnates an infertile female to have a c-section that turns into a giant Alien egg layer, that lays an egg circa Alien in an Engineer, that turns into Mama Alien.  Really.<br /><br />Incept-alien.  An alien in an alien laying an alien to spread aliens.<br /><br />Do yourself a HUGE favor ... just watch Alien/Aliens again!!!

B0046A9MRW|5.0|The Murder of Roger Ackroyd is a brilliantly conceived and written novel. Absolutely gripping from start to finish, and impossible to fathom as each new turn of the tale shifts the reader's perspective on the situation.

B001974DG0|5.0|This book is his best work. I agree with the authors words at the end of the book where he give us information from readers who have said they loved this book more than any of his others. He agreed with them.  I think it's because it has more heart and love and tenderness there.  Everyone loves stories about pets but a dog who can actually communicate with you and share his thoughts! Haven't we all wondered what our pets were thinking from time to time? I've only read this story twice but now that it is on my Kindle it will be with me forever and I'll be reading it over and over.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is very fun and addicting. starts off easy and progresses to harder and more challenging puzzles as you keep playing.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Excellent app. It's easy to see how much batttery is available. I prefer it over the one that came with the Kindle because it is so easy to read.
B0098WWEH8|3.0|I would say that this is a good album. But that's about as far as I would go. Grizzly Bear has the potential of being great but it seems to me that they will never get off that--pretentious, vague, cheap--lyric style that doesn't convey anything real. The feel of their music says much more. Also they're too produced for my taste. I watched a few videos of them playing live and that's where I really lost respect for them. But all in all they're a decent band and their albums are pretty good.
B0083GVG6K|5.0|I! Purchased this because I missed the original airing. I'm so glad I got it because now I can watch it again, and whenever I want plus there is the benefit of no commercial interruptions.

B009NQKPUW|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and would categorize it as an instant sci fi classic for the home collection.<br /><br />While there are those who enjoy finding fault in the details, I allow myself to be pleasantly entertained by the fantasy.  Known physics render sci fi movie plots impossible. Seems silly to accept that light speed is real but assume future medicine can't allow a woman to have an alien surgically removed then go all \\"warrior princess\\" a few minutes later.  For all those who want to get picky....  this movie can't even be prequel.  If the Prometheus crew left earth about seventy years from now and traveled 2.5 years at faster than light speed (Wyland files on BlueRay disc reference ship's FTL drive), then the Aliens saga as we know it from the first movies would have concluded hundreds of thousands if not millions of years before Prometheus even lands on that Engineer's moon.  Time becomes infinite at light speed.  Even at near light speed 2.5 years to the crew might be millions of years to everything outside the craft.  Assuming the Engineer traveled back to earth to destroy us(yet another million or more years in the future) I think he might find his old-school tech laughable to us our highly evolved society.  So don't let the \\"that's not possible\\" or \\"that's stupid\\" arguments deter you from kicking back and enjoying the ride.  I choose to let Prometheus deliver.  I hope you do too.<br /><br />I will say this... the extended/deleted scenes should have been better integrated in the blue ray edition.  They are viewable separate from the movie and add a lot of wonderful context about the opening scene and offer a dialogue between David and the Engineer.  All of which were cut to satiate momentum.  I would love to have the option of seeing them included in the main movie.  Maybe the director's cut will suffice.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|\\"Wool\\": Omnibus Edition, is a five book, sci-fi work of fiction by author Hugh Howey.

TOTALLY GREAT and RECOMMENDED!!!!!! OVERKILL RULES FOREVER!!!!!!!!!
B0080OJBQW|1.0|It's a bad sign when a new album isn't heavily promoted, especially when the artist's last album did pretty well. It's even worse when you find the album in the $2.99 bin at your local music store less than one month after its release. This is not a good deal; it's a bad omen.<br /><br />Such is what happened when I purchased pop star Adam Lambert's latest CD \\"Trespassing\\". Let's get this straight (no pun intended): I love Adam. His \\"what you see is what you get\\" attitude is win, and I love that he pushes the envelope. He has some fantastic pipes and rock growl that will knock you off of your chair. He is practically dripping with sex appeal as a same-sex loving, Elvis Presley doppelganger, and his 2009 release, \\"For Your Entertainment\\", was a defiant rebel yell against the hypocrisy that is \\"American Idol\\". His latest album, however, is surprisingly disappointing.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed when I first put the CD into my car's player, but I dutifully skipped ahead, thinking that maybe there were two or three gems amongst the filler. Sadly, I could not find one song that didn't sound like its rightful place was as background music to conversations in a nightclub. Gone are the stand-outs we loved from \\"For Your Entertainment,\\" like \\"Strut,\\" \\"Broken Open,\\" and the title track.  Only one track on \\"Trespassing\\" (\\"Outlaws of Love\\") perked up my ears, and even that was forgettable. The sentiments expressed over being in love and society's refusal to acknowledge said love were touching and sad, but the song remains in safer territory. The rest of the album is filler fluff. How can you take a CD seriously when it proudly displays the shamelessly titled \\"Pop That Lock\\"?nce to which album of the two is of a superior quality.
B000002UB2|5.0|I simply love this album.  My collection of vinyls is on the rise, ranging anywhere from the \\"Cramps\\" to \\"Don Carlos\\". This album is one of the few that i can let play from beginning to end without having to skip tracks.  I truly appreciate the complete side B, and how flawlessly John and Paul harmonize till the end.  Well played good sirs...

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book has been one of the best books I've read in awhile. I couldn't put it down, but when it ended I was slightly upset. This book is an emotional roller coaster! It made me laugh at loud, angry, happy, nostalgic, excited and depressed. The plot was unique, at least from what I usually read (favorites: Mitch Albom, Jodi Picoult, Laurie Halse-Anderson), and I never thought that it was boring. I yearn for more but in the end, there is no way to make this book better. I will be looking into more of John Green's books.
0345803493|5.0|The trilogy is a romantic, racy, cant put down read. Not for young readers but a good read for adults. It was so so popular that i had a hard time finding it in a town that closed its only book store so made sure to have the next book in the series before I finished the last.
0425263908|5.0|This book was an easy read that I am taking my time on because the second and third books are not out! I do not want to have to wait when I finish this one!

B008I34YYY|2.0|I really, really wanted to like this movie after seeing the trailers after which I immediately ordered it. The special effects are remarkably well done. The soundtrack was beautiul. The concept was clever. Sadly, the execution simply left me somewhere between flat and annoyed. It impressed me for about the first ten minutes before disappointment took over. The humour was startlingly childish in many instances and came across as forced and self-conscious in even more.<br />  Even though I'd been warned by a previous Amazon reviewer that aspects of Iron Sky might prove insulting, I thought it wouldn't be so bad that it would override the humour that political/cultural  satire is SUPPOSED to have. The idea that American conservatives are filling the niche left available by the death of the Third Reich is as insulting as it is tiresome and, well, simply not funny.<br />  If you must see Iron Sky, watch it on Netflix if they ever get it (They haven't yet.) or rent it somewhere, but don't make the same mistake I did by buying it. Es ist sehr schrecklich!

B000JMKTLO|4.0|I really loved Flynn's \\"Gone Girl\\" and was hoping for a similar mind-twisting read.  Not surprising that this was a precursor to that book -- she is a very good writer, and can spin a wonderful yarn.  Intelligent prose, although others felt it was far fetched and drew too much on popular social themes such as \\"bullying\\" and \\"cutting\\" - I felt it was more topical than set up to exploit.  Also, even in the book, the idea is that mental illness rarely presents in one particular disease, it's usually several diseases that can be contagious and affect the lives of families and those in their communities.  Only four stars because I've read better by Flynn, and am now looking forward to \\"Dark Places\\" which I see has gotten accolades from the Kindle community.  Did return this one to the library quickly, there are 27 readers waiting - and it's too \\"girly\\" a book for my husband to like, especially since he has several in his queue.<br /><br />For those following my reviews -- I'm coming to enjoy and anticipate the genre more and more -- sometimes it's great to just enjoy a fun read!

B00005OM4K|5.0|Transferring your vinyl collection to your computer and/or your portable media player is a long process and if you can find CD releases of your albums, it makes the job so much easier.  The only problem is that CD releases aren't always the same as the vinyl versions you grew up with and remember.  Since the 1975 'The Golliwogs Pre-Creedence' is not available on CD, re-creating the album from the Creedence Clearwater Revival Box Set will get you something a little bit different.  The tracks: \\"You Came Walking\\" and \\"You Got Nothin' On Me\\" both contain studio chatter before the songs.  \\"Where You Been\\" has a longer fade.  \\"You Can't Be True\\" is a slightly extended version.  \\"You Better Be Careful\\" is also an extended version.  \\"Walking On The Water\\" is a longer alternate version.  And \\"You Better Get It Before It Gets You\\" is a really extended version.  And in the 'for what it's worth' department I had to adjust my turntable speed for all the cuts on the album to get them to match the CD, I wonder which one is right.  Apart from all that, if you like CCR, this puts it all in one easy to get collection (well, other than the fact if you're a purist, 'Susie Q' is only available here as the album cut and not split into two parts as it was on the single release).

030758836X|3.0|\\"Gone Girl\\" was the first novel I read by Gillian Flynn. The characters are not people you root for that is for sure and they are very complex. While I do not read a lot of mystery fiction and would like to read more, this book did have suspenseful parts, but I agree with a lot of other readers in saying the ending was unsatisfying.  Ms. Flynn is a detailed writer and makes the characters very in depth. I do think some parts of the book were unrealistic, but also made the plot more interesting. I have to say most of the characters do leave a bitter taste in your mouth. I'm interested in how other people who have read this book digested the ending. Is it an amazing book? No. But it's an intense psychological read for those who enjoy that type of mystery. I'd recommend \\"Before I Go to Sleep: A Novel\\" by S.J. Watson, instead of this book, but I would not discourage anyone from reading it.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|We rented this to watch as a family movie. We all enjoyed it very much. Drama, funny stuff. Would recommend watching.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book definitely lived up to the hype. Finished in less than a week! Intense descriptions.made.me feel like Miss Steele :)
1423140605|5.0|I have to say I think this is probably my favorite book Rick has come out with so far. I like all the characters, I love how everything is set in this book. The plot and the settings were perfectly set up. And emotions that are going through all the character are just really fun. If you really like the relationship between Percy and Annabeth you will love this book. It was kind of sad that this book wasn't longer, and he didn't go into more depth with all the characters. But other than that this book is great. I like how the book ended, but it is very sad that I have to actually wait another year.
1449410243|5.0|**Note: The author does use swear words in this book, and it is sometimes quite colorful. Just a heads up.<br /><br />Preordered for a cat-lover friend. Now, that same book has changed hands 10+ times to other people who want to read it. It was an excellent purchase.<br /><br />Personally, I would use this book for a good toilet-read or I would throw it on a coffee table when friends are coming over so that somebody can have a few good laughs.<br /><br />The poster included is perfect and is currently on the wall in my room. It's not big enough to read from far away, which kind of stinks, but it is good to have up somewhere. Makes me smile when I see it up on the wall.<br /><br />Overall, I'm pleased with this purchase. There is more content than expected and everyone who has read it really seems to enjoy it. The comics are detailed and are easily understood, even for people who have no cats. The book itself is well made, and is very colorful. Really going to enjoy showing this to more and more people.<br /><br />Hope this helps!

B003HE2BKS|5.0|I don't even write reviews for music albums but I felt I had to for this because of how dramatically different this version is to the original. This one's a lot better. This, or something similar to it needed to be what they put out. The original album, unlike her other albums just didn't have that spark. Songs like Russian Roulette, Photographs, Rockstar 101 & Stupid in Love sounds soo much better, especially if you have a good system. Rihanna is brilliant. When it comes to making good music, there is very few like her in the game. If you're looking to get Rated R, this version is definitely the way to go.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Very poor writing. I was disappointed with the book. The writing language was very poor. She used redundancy in her verb choices....boring.  There are other better written descriptive romance novels out there that draw the reader into the book.  I found myself skimming most of the book because I was bored.  This book just had a great marketing team; that's it. I did not feel this was a &#34;true Best Seller novel&#34; to capitivate the reader. Sorry. But this is sad if the BEST SELLERS list is now determined by people who really don't have a clue on the true art of writing novels.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is one of the best game apps I've downloaded. The game scales the difficulty well, from very easy to I-still-haven't-finished-it challenging. Complete each level, or finish perfectly. It has NEVER crashed or froze. It responds excellently to touch. The only downside at all is I'm going to run out of levels to play.
0061537969|3.0|Interesting view of racing, although I really wanted more about that part. The relationship with the dog and the man is great, if a bit of a fantasy. I like that the dog is an integral part of the family, but of course, seeing a dog as a person is not exactly totally respectful of the dog...  One thing I wish I could complain about to Garth Stein is one reference he makes to Lolita: he apparently thinks that Lolita was a little girl who seduced a grown man into kidnapping her and raping her repeatedly. Anyone who has read the actual book, called Lolita, would not use that name, that way. So why bother to use it at all since  you don't know what it means? From Rebecca Solnit: It’s just when you identify with Lolita you’re clarifying that this is a book about a white man serially raping a child over a period of years. Should you read Lolita and strenuously avoid noticing that this is the plot and these are the characters? Should the narrative have no relationship to your own experience?

B007URVZJ6|4.0|This a good, step-by-step tour through the basics of creating a book to be published on the Kindle. It corrected several misconceptions about the tools needed to convert a book to Kindle. Like using MS Word to edit. Also, the tips on how to format the titles and spaces between the paragraphs are key information if you want your book to look right on the digital page.<br /><br />The book is short enough that I don't dread reading it again just before I tackle converting my first novel from print to Kindle format.<br />Chris Caldwell

The music is just as clean and fresh as the first album. The lyrics are just as heart felt and emotionally driven. Everything about \\"Babel\\" is exactly what we've come to expect from Mumford and Sons! Well worth the price of admission. :D

B0074YVW1G|4.0|I did not know we Introverts had a problem (perhaps only in USA). Actually we rather like our own self sufficient, thoughtful & quiet sytle. Having said that the book provides interesting insights into human behaviour. It suggests ways of making sure introverts are heard and so contribute fully to the betterment of all of society. After all Introverts are nearly half of the population.

0316228532|1.0|I'm so glad I did not purchase this book, but I carry tremendous guilt that I am the person who asked that our public library pay money to order it!  Not one likeable character, no real plot, horrible all the way through, then an even worse ending.  I would not have even finished it, other than my optimism that JK Rowling would at some point in the book, make it all worthwhile.  Did not happen!  Had this been her first book, it would have been her last.

B008G8SFGO|4.0|This is a decent disc. I wont do song breakdowns , but its solid Kiss for the most part. People seem to forget that what we are dealing with is a band led by 2 60+ year old guys now that has been in existence for 40 years!! We cant relive the 70's, or 80's. They probably wont deliver another REAL solid CD like 'Revenge' again. But that said, what other so called rock bands at their age are delivering home runs? None. The 2 'newer' members (if you want to call them that at this point) add the energy element and songwriting ability needed to help Kiss deliver a relevant record.<br />This disc is a major improvement over 'Psycho Circus' and the overall weak 'Sonic Boom'. This is more in the 80's style in songwriting, but more Guitar driven then say 'Crazy Nights'. The lyrics are cheese/rock star style which is better than attempted sing along anthems that don't work like on the last 2 discs. This is a welcome change as I thought the last 2 CD's were more focused on the artwork, merchandising and commercial appeal than the actual music and the other members were trying to create that Ace and Peter 70's style playing than actually being themselves.<br /><br />What I do like about this disc is the fact that they wrote it on their own and Paul Stanley Produced it (as he produced their best 80's disc 'Animalize'). Tommy Thayer is stepping out of that 'by-the-numbers' Ace Frehely clone playing and delivers some solid solo's on here. The band has gelled well over the years. Too bad Bruce Kulick didn't play a small part in the co-writing stage as I feel this could have been a good time to add even more of the 'Revenge' elements. These songs are solid, catchy and rockin for the most part, some of the chorus's lack a bit of creativity. But its Kiss. And to be honest, to hear 60+ year old guys singing some of these corny lyrics is a bit funny. But I still love the guys (Gene and Paul) for having the guts and swagger to do it.<br /><br />I have been a KISS fan since 7 years old (36 years now) and I am glad they are still around. Its always nostalgic. The newer members, regardless of what others say, add some needed energy to the band. Ace and Peter would have been horrible at this point, lets be honest. So I enjoy the fact that they still create new music. Glad the whole band wrote some of this together and they all seem more focused on songwriting and rocking out. I am sure to listen to this disc more than the last 2.<br /><br />Who knows, maybe they will milk the whole tour circuit again in a few years without makeup and deliver the record of their career as they did with 'Revenge' in '92 (Even though they will have to do it with walkers). But this hit or miss CD is a step in the right direction and shows that they still can deliver a decent album. That is worth the 4 stars in itself.6 years now) and I am glad they are still around.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|The controversy and criticism of \\"Prometheus\\" pretty much centers on two things: 1. Movie fans expected a straight-up \\"Alien\\" prequel, complete with queens, face-huggers, and worker aliens, and 2. The film does not have a neatly laid out, simplistic plot like the usual fare we see nowadays. Director Ridley Scott decided to go his own way, not taking the easy and simple route. The result is a masterpiece of mystery and questions. Lost by the critics is Scott's examination of human nature and the desire for absolute power and immortality contained within the search for our origins.<br /><br />Prometheus asks big questions about the creation of life on Earth, as well as what might be out there in deep space beyond our present technological capabilities. Human civilization has existed for a mere few thousand years, but the universe is billions of years old. The foolish belief by many of us today that we somehow have it all figured out is exemplified in the film by the monumental hubris of Peter Weyland, who selfishly set up the expedition to somehow cheat death-and to profit by whatever else it found.<br /><br />The fact that the Engineers in Prometheus were able to create magnificent technologies on such a vast scale only amplifies the mysteries of what we don't know. The universe is vast beyond our comprehension, and the world Ridley Scott creates in this film, with it's monsters, spacecraft, and buildings reinforce his plot device. The ending of the film, with the robot David and Dr. Shaw leaving LV-223 in the Engineer spacecraft, tells us in no uncertain terms that there remains a great deal still to be discovered.<br /><br />Think about it! Humanity has only begun to scratch the surface of space travel; we've only landed a few men on the moon, and the sum total of our exploration beyond that is limited to our own solar system-which constitutes a tiny portion of the Milky Way galaxy. We humans are like a speck of sand on the shores of a vast ocean-but one must remember it was only a few centuries ago that we thought Earth was the center of the universe!<br /><br />It takes a bit more than Transformers or the Avengers (which is a good movie for its intended audience) to touch on the kind of questions Scott is tackling here. He assumes his audience will consider the questions his film is asking. Many critics condemned \\"2001\\" and the original \\"Alien\\" for the very same things people are saying now; they weren't easy to understand, they didn't fit into established categories, etc.<br /><br />\\"Prometheus\\" thus fits into something the ancient Greek philosopher Socrates said 2400 years ago: \\"I know nothing except the fact of my own ignorance.\\" Scott asked us to open our minds, and see beyond the usual formula stuff. It seems some lack the imagination to follow where he leads. That's okay. I'm quite willing to go on the journey.ber it was only a few centuries ago that we thought Earth was the center of the universe!<br /><br />It takes a bit more than Transformers or the Avengers (which is a good movie for its intended audience) to touch on the kind of questions Scott is tackling here.

B009B51K9U|4.0|I really like this album because it feels like the Green Day of old. I hear so much of how they used to be on Kerplunk and 39/Smooth in this album. I loved the last two albums and how the stories flowed through the music, but I really appreciate the era of Sweet Children and the growth of Green Day and that is what they have gone back to. Billie Joe Armstrong can do no wrong - that man writes lyrics like poetry and I adore him as an artist.<br />Get the album - if you love Green Day you WILL NOT be disappointed.

B006Z7Z3S6|3.0|A lot of people have reviewed this flick and some thought it pretty much bit the big one, while others thought it went more for spooky nuance than the big scare. For the most part, it did go for nuance, but there were still some cheap scares. So I'm siding with the former.<br /><br />Here's the scoop. A vintage New England hotel, the Yankee Pedlar, is closing down. The owner is in the Barbados, and two young folk are left to man the place on it's final weekend. The only guests are a mother and son, a one-time actress turned psychic and an old fellow with fond memories of the place. The hotel has a reputation for being haunted by a ghost tied to a particular incident. The kids want to record evidence of the haunting. Of course, things get out of hand.<br /><br />The only other film I've seen from writer/director Ti West was \\"The House of the Devil\\" and I liked it quite a bit. This outing, however, is a real stinker. There were individual scenes, between the two leads, that I liked quite a bit, but the story overall was a mess. Like most (if not all) haunted type flicks there is something at the center of the haunting needing resolve. Here it's a woman who hanged herself on her wedding day. Little clues are given but there is no logical building of the clues to a resolve. The viewer never finds out what happened to bring on the misery. I'm not certain what the mother/son characters were there for. They have nothing to do with the story and are written out of the script about two thirds the way in. There are a couple of cheap, jump scares and there is no way to know why it ends the way it does. And what about the old guy? He is nowhere integral to the story. Was he needed to fill in the clock? This movie is just stupid over and over. All it really has are a couple of good characters. I liked Sarah Paxton and Pat Healy as the two leads. But they just couldn't get their story, or the overall story, on track. And Kelly McGillis is a veteran. She does a decent job, but it's way too convenient that she shows up in this place on this particular weekend.<br /><br />The production values are good enough. The Yankee Pedlar is a cool place with a lot of personality. It made for a great setting, but there just wasn't enough here for a movie, and what little there was was put together all wrong.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This last book had a different pace than the 1st 2 books.  It lacked the action and life-threatening-edge-of-your-seat pacing that made the 1st 2 books so fantastic.  The ending wrapped things up in a way I could foresee, but may not satisfy other readers.  It was enjoyable, but not overtly thrilling.  Product did arrive instantaneously and upload perfectly.
0984999302|5.0|This book is so much more than just a Startup Owner's Manual. It's a whole new paradigm of what a start-up really is. A start up is not a smaller version of a big company. Starting up has it's own identity and nature. This book covers all of that and takes the pressure of trying to start a small version of a big company. It's an experiment and one of my take-aways is you should have a little fun in the process. Enjoy!

B001TAJGO6|5.0|I like Kate Winslet in this movie. I like her way of talking and her manner. I like that she and Joel both go to places where not many people visit. I like that they visit empty beaches in the winter, ride buses to empty places and eat at restaurants not filled up with lots of people. I like that Joel writes and makes pictures of things. I like that Kirsten's character likes quotes that make a person think and feel. I like Kate's hair colors and styles. I like her differentness. Why would someone want to erase their memories? That is what the movie is kind of about. How they do it and their experience of it while its being done. Do we just throw away the stuff we don't like? Do we embrace it? I prefer to keep mine. They find out that even though they try to control their thoughts which is also their feelings or vice versa it still doesn't really change who they are. They erase their relationship and connection but they do it all over again anyway. Maybe the erasing helped them to grow because they found out about it. And they got back together with that knowledge. I mainly like the places where you go that hold spirit and aloneness, it is nice to share it with another and that was kind of what Clemintine understood and Joel just did. I liked the chinese restaurant, the neat music, the ending song, the connections of the people.

B0097PW7H8|5.0|I've tried DOZENS of battery apps. This is by far the best. First off, this has a notification on the status bar with your current health. It then goes through all the things that consume battery. It gives you a time of how long your battery will last with your current settings. It then gives you tips to improve the battery and even gives the amount of time added by doing said action. Get it and you will never regret it.

I ordered a new one, got it quickly and am very pleased with it. It is just like the one I had the end fits on it as always, and I was able to recharge my battery immediately. I have now gone so far as to buy another kindle. I have a kindle fire this time. It is even easier to use and smaller. I love that it can do thing just by touching it. My other one was a kindle from 2009. It still works great, but thought it was time to get a new one. I will be giving this one to someone who really needs it, but may not be able to afford one now. I love my new one. Thank You

B008G8SFGO|1.0|Not sure which one sucks more this one or Sonic Boom. In one respect it's even one further downward turn from Sonic Boom, which is that the production went from fairly clear to the muddy garbage that trendies and the mindless will listen to.<br /><br />Either get inspired or quit, Kiss! Listen when people plead and shout mercy!<br /><br />Another problem as usual is the rating system. It makes this album look more popular than it is. Like myself, some others did not want to give this ANY stars, yet our stars add to the total. And with a new system, some people that voted 2 stars would vote as 1 star. If you took out the one stars, ratings would show as about 2.5 to 3.

B007J4T2G8|3.0|Writing is good and story is interesting.  It's not for everyone, though.  It's explicit to the point of being pornographic which will be good for some and bad for others.  The story contains kinky material which will also be distasteful to some.<br /><br />With the typical \\"contains material not suitable for...\\" caution, I recommend the book.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the app is amazing. all it needs now is flint and steel for creative mode. a lava &amp; water bucket. and rails and minecarts. it also needs the ability to change your skin. also armour would be nice. but other than those things this app is amazing. the multiplayer id cool as well. they need to make it long distance though. but the app is still cool. I give it 4 stars for the missing items. but they need to develop it. Notch. if your reading this. put these items in pocket edition please. thanks for reading my review.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I can't say enough about this app. Not only is it elegantly designed, it is tremendously useful. I have had absolutely no problems with it, and it has transformed my workflow. Do yourself a favor and upgrade to the Premium account to really free yourself to manage large image files and videos, etc.  I love this app.--

B003568FR6|3.0|I started this workout system 35 days before my wedding. I completed it in 32 days, taking only 2 days off from the workouts (once because I was sick, the other because I was camping). I had been running 3 miles a few times a week for months before this, so my cardio health was already good so I moved from level 1 to level 2 after just 5 days. I spent 10 days at level 2 and then moved to level 3 and spent the remaining 15 days at level 3. It's definitely a thorough workout and I liked that each level was so different from the one before it-- however, her banter gets VERY repetitive after about 5 days or so. You can imagine how I felt by day 15 of level 3...<br />As far as weight loss goes, I didn't shed a pound. Literally. I actually gained a pound or two in the whole process. (I'm 5'4'' and I started out at 130 and ended at about 132) HOWEVER, don't let that deter you from doing the workout, especially if you're like me and you're not looking to lose a ton of weight, just tone up. By the end, my stomach was much flatter and I could definitely feel that I was leaner. I lost about an inch around my waist and hips but my thighs and arms actually got slightly bigger (because my muscles were increasing). By my wedding day, I didn't have my little gut anymore, my back was lean, and I felt very good and confident in my dress. But the title is definitely deceiving-- I didn't feel \\"shredded\\" by day 30. Maybe it was because I wasn't also following her strict diet plan, however, I was definitely eating very modestly and healthily because it was before my wedding.<br />My suggestion for anyone wanting to do this (and who isn't in a rush to lose weight) is to alternate between levels 2 and 3 a few times a week for a few months. You'll really start to see muscle definition then I believe. I didn't see anything like that in my 32 days but like I said, I got leaner. And I suggest doing both level 2 and level 3 because I believe they're almost equally as hard (1 isn't worth including in a mixup routine, unless you're just looking for a mini workout). I feel like level 3 was missing some of the important components of level 2 so if you decide to NOT do this in 30 days and do it out of order, I would definitely just alternate between levels 2 and 3.<br />As for the DVD itself, the music gets a little old and as I mentioned, Jillian gets a little annoying. The most frustrating part, however, is that they put Anita, the girl who is in incredible shape, as the \\"beginner\\" person to watch and then put Natalie (an adorable Beyonce lookalike) as the \\"challenging\\" person to watch but Natalie is constantly half-assing the workouts!! I DON'T recommend watching Natalie for the more difficult modifications unless you just want to laugh about how she's just got a dazed smile on the entire time while she sort of does the moves... Just keep your eyes on Jillian.<br />I think my workout dvd days are over but who knows, I might bust out my Jillian Michael's DVD on a frosty day this winter when it's too cold to run outside and I need a dose of Natalie to make me smile.

0316228532|5.0|This review doesn't have spoilers.<br />First, if you are a Harry Potter fan, and are looking for this book to have the same content, then this book is not for you.  That being said, if you are a fan of JK Rowling's writing abilities/story telling capabilities, then read on.<br /><br />The story has a slow start, with character introduction being key.  Once you get through the intro of characters, the story is told in true JK Rowling fashion. She weaves a story with great character development, as everyone's lives intersect and outcomes of their lives are dependent upon others' decisions...true to real life.  The setting in itself is a character, but not so in a primary role, more of a support to the main characters.  If you have ever lived in a small town, you will relate to this story and the workings of the town and it's surroundings. If you haven't lived in a small town, I still think you will relate to the story, simply because you are alive and it is so true to life.<br /><br />Overall, this book should have a high rating. It is a gritty story that makes you care about the characters, despise the characters, understand the workings of how despite good intentions, bad things can still happen, and vice versa. I preordered this book in April(forgetting that I did), and when I realized this was going to be delivered, I almost cancelled based upon reviews.  I am so glad that I didn't cancel as this is a great book by an outstanding author and I would recommend that people read this book, and maybe learn a little about true life through this story.

B00112GVFO|3.0|There is absolutely no chemistry between Matthew M.  and Penelope C. Steve Zahn's character is borderline annoying. W.H. Macy and all the other characters are absolutely one-dimensional. BUT the plot line of the bad guys covering up how the mine activities is KILLING locals is happening RIGHT NOW in Nigeria.  THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN ARE DYING OR BEING PERMANENTLY BLINDED OR DISABLED! [...]   People are dying and it's all just part of the G-20's continuing extraction of wealth from third world countries.
B004ZJZQBK|5.0|I really liked this movie years ago when it first came out. Seeing it in Blu-Ray made it worth buying it and watching it again. The special effects in this movie are great!
B004OO4UFY|4.0|This album is a ridiculous amount of fun to listen to. Each track brings a large smile to my face. However, the one minor point against is that it doesn't really hang together as a cogent concept. I understand this isn't what they were going for, but be ready to think, \\"this is the next track?\\" a few times through out listening.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|That app is wonderful. My wife was having a really hard time managing her files on her kindle fire. I downloaded ES File Explorer and solved all her problems. Thank you!

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I've read a lot of Stephen King's book - and for me 11/22/63 had to be one of his best, if not his best book. I really enjoyed The Dome when I read it last year; but this book I think was more believable and a brilliant read from start to finish. I'll say the ultimate sacrilage now - I think this book was better than The Stand! Its that good, and best of all was the ending. I loved the characters, the plot twists - and the suspense, just awesome and a great new spin on time travel.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Blade runner transcends time! From soundtrack to cinematography, direction and acting the movie is top to bottom a concept ahead of its time. Consider the movie was released in 1982!<br />This movie is a must for movie buffs and collectors. Enjoy it!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|This movie is just what you hope it will be.  Smart, fun, action and excitement.  Enjoy yourself and get carried away with this one.

B00009RAJJ|5.0|I bought the LP long before there was an Amazon and it was one of those albums that I couldn't stop listening to. This seems to be one of the more controversial Fleetwood Mac albums, but it is my favorite.  It would be a boring world if everyone liked the same thing.  While I love The Beach Boys' Pet Sounds and The Beatles Sgt. Pepper, some people don't, and I wouldn't put them down for that.  I never warmed up to Dark Side of the Moon, which is one of the greatest albums of all time and like, but don't love, The Band's Music from Big Pink, which is another of the greatest albums of all time on just about any reputable list.  If you are a Fleetwood Mac fan, you might want to give this one a chance.
0307932427|5.0|This is an excellent book.  Diamond explains how planting crops changed some people from hunter gatherers to farmers.  He also explains why other societies did not change.  He explains how and where the original crops came from.  The explanation for how this changed societies was eye opening for me.  I loved this book.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. Definitely worth 99 cents.  My only complaint is that I wanted more. Uniquely challenging zen like puzzle game.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|To start with, Mumford's first album was absolutely fantastic. I came into this album knowing it would be good but not sure if it could top Sigh No More. Rest assured: they have done it. This album is absolutely fantastic from start to finish. There are no songs on this CD worth skipping. Do not hesitate -- buy it.
B0086700CM|5.0|ok I feel everybody's pain but I feel on my opinion that everybody has their OWN perspective. its hard to say this but on this I take everybody's side. it may be fun for you or not. downloading problems is not amazon's falt so you can not blame them for your troubles.even though I am not one of them...... you have my apologies.

I sent it through shop and ship and pay more much money.
B003ASLJO0|5.0|Another great Clint Eastwood movie! This one will tickle your funny bone and bring a tear to your eye as it takes your emotions for a ride, very good acting, character development and depth, something lacking in 95% of movies nowadays.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I've read plenty of books, but this is the first time I felt the need to write a review.  This series captured me by about the 25th page.  When I first started reading I felt the way some people have pointed out, too much detail.  I kept reading and there was no turning back.  I understand why Howey gives so much detail...after reading all 6 books, I feel like I could navigate all the locations in the book as if they were real!  Not only does he make you feel as though you are there while the story is being told and personally know the characters, but he manages to throw several curve balls throughout the story.  LOVED this series and cannot wait for more!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|couldn't wait to play this game. Love it ....looked for it for quite some time...couldn't remember what it was called.  very happy!
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|I am not very familiar with Lou Reed so I didn't have any particular expectations.  I think his narration fits really well with the music. In fact, I wonder sometimes who is accompanying whom, Lou the Metallica or the other way around?<br />As for Metallica, I am finally excited to hear some Metal from them. No pop sounding melodies or cheese arrangements, just pretty hard hitting grooves and chord progressions. Probably the best record since \\"And Justice for all\\" in my opinion.<br /><br />I find reading all the bad review about this album very ironic and intriguing. This record seems to be having the same faith as Lulu, the girl in the play. She is messed up, used and abused, made into villain and yet vulnerable and victimized after all.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Will say I wasn't impressed with the final book. It wasn't bad but turned more into a sappy love story. Far take from the first book. Had to force myself to finish it.

B005MMJ84K|5.0|This sequel to Delirium is as enigmatic as the original. Once again the reader gets drawn into the emotional turmoil boiling inside of Lena, and gets to experience her journey, not just as a witness, but as someone invested in the life of this stunning and complex character.
B009AJDDQU|4.0|I thought it was pretty good. I love sci-fi movies. Charlize Theron in one was quite a surprise. We see far too few of these types of movies that made the 1980s great. Advanced technology, advanced ideas.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|What can I say? first time owning a invicta watch and one of the best watches I have ever purchased. Price is very good. Quality is excellent. Recommend to anyone.
0375850864|5.0|This novel discusses the experiences of the main character Miranda. She is twelve years old and lives in Manhattan in 1979. This was a time when children could freely roam the streets. Even though I never experienced that the text in When You Reach Me made me feel as though I was actually in the 70s. I love the suspense that was created, and how everything connected at the end.<br /><br />Throughout the book Miranda gains and loses friends, and deals with many of the same types of issues most sixth grade girls do. Her experiences in the book allow Miranda to see things from different perspectives, and grow as a person. This is relatable to many young readers because it shows the main characters struggles to go from child to young adult, which many readers may currently be experiencing.<br /><br />The suspenseful \\"note-leaver\\" who believes they can see what is going to happen in the future, and gives this book the essence of time-travel and sci-fi. This book covers a wide range of genres and would be interesting to most.<br />Not only is this book extremely relatable and entertaining, will teach readers great lessons as well. When You Reach Me not only teaches how to treat people, it showed how to get along with others through growing and evolving relationships without sounding preachy.
B0091REZMW|4.0|So far I have enjoyed this came ..series of rooms to find objects .. limited time for the item hunt ..  .. so far have not seen any major hiccup.  This game is much more than a seek and search game ..Give it a try
B009A3NGF4|5.0|These guys are just amazing! I found M&S a year before thie Sigh No More release, singing and traveling around with Laura Marling. Its safe to say, I have been in love with them ever since.  The emotion that pours out of them when they play is breathtaking.  Their new albulm Babel, is a continuation of what M&S is all about. For anyone who is a true M&S fan, most of the songs on the album you will have already heard at their shows.  My favorite song 'Babel' has that upbeat tempo and raw emotion that pours out of Marcus when he sings and this song completely shows it.  But it also has the old time folk/blues sound like \\"where are you now\\" in the Deluxe edition. Such a great album. I recommend it to EVERYONE.  If you ever get a chance to see M&S live... do it! You won't be sorry.
B008N5UX9M|1.0|I really want this to be a good album, but it is not.  The best thing about this album is the cover.  Sorry Steve Harris.  Although I don't like this album, you have been with me my whole life and I will buy anything you put out.
B0060D3BWK|5.0|One of the funniest halloween movies I've seen.  Of course I like \\"Christmas Vacation\\" with Chevy Chase. But there is mention of a \\"virgin\\" lighting the black flame candle, several times. So if that's too mature for younger viewers then parents might want to watch first.  However, in my opinion it also points out that being a virgin is nothing to be embarrassed about.  But you will not be disappointed. I think nowadays kids understand the concept. All in fun.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|The book reveals how the Seals conduct their normal day to day training. You see many of the details that make the Seals such a potent force. These are not some macho, soldiers of fortune, but highly intelligent, superbly trained and detail oriented men. Nothing is left to chance. When they start on their mission to kill or capture Bin Laden you find out one of the choppers crash lands but it barely slows them down. You also get a chance to see how the intelligence people operate. I was surprised to see that some people spent 10 year of their life on nothing but tracking Bin Laden. I think the author was able to show us the facts of the raid in an fascinating manner. This is a book that everyone should read if for no other reason to laugh at the politicians when they start tryin to convince you of their importance to the raid.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|something to do when you are bored. its not hard and something to check daily to keep you entertained while waiting for a different game you have to check! lol
B00454U1NS|5.0|Finally, a \\"Greatest hits\\" compilation that actually includes the best songs by one of the greatest female singers of the last years. With her unique style, we hope to hear more from P!nk for the years to come. Simply GREAT!!
B002IU4TLQ|5.0|This is a very thrilling movie that keeps you on your toes. Liam Neeson is amazing! It is also very eye opening to things that do go on in this world.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Ok, maybe it is because I have been really tired when I am trying to read this.  Maybe it is because a lot of the stuff in this book is in reference to what I assume is and are English places and things.  But, I can not comprehend this book at all.  I mean, I read a chapter and instantly forget everything I've read.  No, I do remember key parts.  But the rest just leaps from my mind.  I got to page 30 or so and decided to start over.  She spends a lot of time telling things about characters right away.  Just little things.  I just have not gotten into it yet.  I guess I need a dictionary.  My eyes kind of pop out.  I will try again though.  I mean, it's on my iPad, so I own it for good.  I get the feeling that it is written well, just a lot of stuff that is above me, words, phrases, places and things.<br /><br />I just read another chapter of this book.  What the hell?  I mean, it just seems to ramble on with pointless information again and again.  It tells you so much about so many characters.  Are they main parts of the story?  Hell if I know.  There are so many things happening that really have nothing to do with each other, that it makes it even harder to follow the story (if their is one.)  All these characters, by the time I've read 8 chapters, I have forgotten who the hell the people are.  A name comes up and I think to myself who the heck is that?  This book is a mess.  I was going to rewrite the entire book in a language that I understood.  But that would take far to long.  I wish they would re release this book for the American audience.  It's just so confusing.  I said this a bit ago, but maybe it's because she tells so much about random things that happen.  When doing so, she gives SO much personal detail, which it may turn out really isn't that personal at all.  It's like I'm reading the diary of a 15 year old girl who is in an English class.  No matter how hard I try, I just can not get into or follow this story at all.  But I will continue until I am finished the book.<br /><br />Obviously, there are people who can follow and like this book.  I wish I knew them so they could read the damn thing to me.  I feel like I'm reading a book that is teaching me french.  I'm just lost.  The last chapter or two I read were fine, then the one I just read, about the boy at school with his teacher telling the school about something that happened, was a loss for me.  I have no clue what I just read.  Come on publisher, fix this thing.<br /><br />I just switched this from a 3 to a 1 out of 5.  This book is awful.  You get SO many pointless details about something in every chapter, that is makes it almost impossible to remember the important things.  When I read and finish a chapter, the only way I can have any clue what is going on is to sum up what I've read.  Like 8 pages and I will say to myself \\"the boy wants to be honest and genuine.\\"  That is all I can do for this book to make any sense.  She spends to much time rambling on about nothing.  Not every character needs to tell their life story.  I will finish the book, but it is awful.<br /><br />I am conflicted with what to give this book.  I gave it a 3, then a 1 and now I am just going to give it a 4.  Confused?  Yes, as am I.  While the books has far to much going on for it's own good and it is hard to remember stuff like peoples names and stuff people have done, I can not wait to read the next chapter.  I get so excited when I am about to read it.  As far as I know, that means it is a good book.  So, a 4 out of 5 it is.<br /><br />Knowing that this book has so many things happening, I was thinking about it yesterday, I think this story would make a good mini series.  Theres a lot happening and seeing it all on TV would make it even more interesting.finished the book.<br /><br />Obviously, there are people who can follow and like this book.

B009GEBBNQ|5.0|A great movie that keeps the kids as well as the adults entertained.  Good story line...can't wait for the sequel.
B0012NVGHU|4.0|So this is the movie that spawned the Broadway musical released in March 2012.  Wife and daughter saw the musical in Aug '12 before seeing the movie.  It blew them away with the singing, acting, stage, choreography, script... They couldn't imagine that the movie could live up to that live experience.  While of course not the same, they both loved the movie which rekindled so many warm (and funny) moments.  Is this a blockbuster, mega-million movie? No way and it would lose so much if it were.  Its the flower in a forest that you came upon and simply enjoyed its splendor.  I only saw the movie and was brought into the emotion.  Worth watching quietly.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Loved it!!  This is a great movie! Love how it combined all the separate characters.  Joss Whedon did a great job (as usual!!)

B007XNAPNY|5.0|Den Lennie and James Tonkin did an amazing job in filming this video.  Their multiple camera angles and use of light, movement, direction, brings out the best of Duran Duran.  This is a must purchase for all Duran Duran fans.  Their performance was fabulous.  I highly recommend this blu-ray.

0316228532|3.0|I've never read JK Rowling before and was keen to read this novel based on the majority of reviews which referred to humour - even if black humor - and brilliant depictions of people and life.  The brilliant depictions are true - undeniably Rowling is a gifted writer.  I didn't find any humour, black or otherwise, in this unrelenting picture of self-involvement, class warfare and pettiness.  I can only hope it isn't a real reflection of life in British villages.  Like watching a car crash repeatedly on film, I had to keep going (a testament to the author's skill) to see if there was some kind of redemption or hope available for this sorry and infinitely sad cast of characters.  Nope!  Buy it:  the writing is excellent, but the story line left me feeling rather like the character Sukhvinder.
0316228532|1.0|What a disapointment. While JK certainly doesn't need the proceeds from this book, somehow I think she owes her readers at least a shot at an entertaining read.  Enough has been said about plot etc. The effect of this book is depression and boredom.  Can she successfully put one word behind another to make a sentence? Sure. Is the outcome pleasant to read?  Not in this case.  JK has said that she doesn't much care what people have to say about her book, she wanted to write it. So there.  If this book did not have J.K. Rowling on  the cover I would not have bought it.  Adult fare  she says.  I will stay a kid, thank you.
B009CPEOC4|5.0|I rented this movie for my daughter as she loves Katy Perry.  I have heard of Katy Perry and seen bits and pieces of her videos but never really paid too much attention. I sat down with my daughter and watched this movie and really enjoyed it. She worked really hard to get where she is. I loved seeing her with her grandmother and her family.  She is very dedicated and professional. It was heartbreaking to have to watch her perform when she was so upset about her husband.  I have a new respect for her. I enjoyed this movie and recommend it to anyone of any age, male or female.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|This film was clearly designed with a video game in mind. The first two minutes of the film summarizes all the films that you may have missed: Virus, bad mutants. Alice, good mutant. And something about the red queen.<br /><br />In our soon to be released video game based on the film, the main character (Milla Jovovich) wakes up in a strange location wearing a skimpy towel. There will be a nude patch that you can download for the game that the manufacturer will swear it had nothing to do with. You then have 2 minutes to find your clothes and escape during a computer failure, one that is poorly designed and defaults to open the door and return your clothes. Once outside you will need to quickly locate weapons and kill low level mutants to level up. You are then forced to return to the facility. Here you team up with someone (Bingbing Li) who looks like Tifa Lockhart (FF VII). You gather as may weapons as you can. Make sure to take extra weapons to arm any future new members of your party.<br /><br />You now have 2 hours to escape the underground area by passing through models of various cities. You kill mutants for points and save humans who you can add to your party while you go to the rendezvous location to meet up with your rescue squad. Due to the cloning nature of the facility you can meet up with people from previous films who couldn't possibly be here. The film ends at a point where we can have a CG sequel and video game.<br /><br /> 5 star movie if you love watching someone else play a video game.<br /><br />Parental Guide: I don't recall any F-bombs, although don't hold me to that. No sex. No nudity, but skimpy outfits.
B006MW3VGA|5.0|Love downton abbey, really enjoyed every minute. Sat on my bed, watching episode after episode within a period of a few days. My plan is to do it again in time for the 3rd season to premiere in the US.
B007B5EDEG|5.0|Just finished the first 5 books. Love the winding, far reaching story. Love the twists and no-traditional turns - the hero does not always come out on top. Love the characters who are so diverse. Frustrated by the saga not being complete yet but will have to be patient. In fact I am going to start reading it again to catch all the little things that I missed first time round. Cant wait for book 6 and 7. Hope Mr Martin is writing furiously!
B005O7Q6FM|5.0|I've watched castle from season 1, and this is probably the best season by far. Lost of deep episodes and the character interactions actually evolve.

0689853637|5.0|great book it arrived before the time specified and in great shape. My children really enjoy this book it full of amazing pop ups.
B004MOMT2M|2.0|Sounds pretty good but they didn't do the titling/buttoning right... you hit dolby 5.1 and it's like you hit nothing.  Has 4 or so videos that seem to be 5.1 - the audio portion I have a hard time telling if it's that or just fancy surround.  Could be much better in my opinion with a little more clarity on the procedural stuff and perhaps better mixing.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I really like this album. It gets away from the lame Bon Jovi choruses and leaves you with good song structure. The reviews here are for the album not if you want mommy to come back. I would rather have new material than dream about the wonder years. If you don't like the band, or who's in it then don't buy this. Move on and have a wonderful life. Like who you want and leave others to like what they want.
B0099G3I96|4.0|Huge No Doubt fan.  It's been a long 11 years, but these songs deliver.  There is some filler in the second half of the songs, but the first five are outstanding.  Love Settle Down, great comeback track.  Push and Shove is probably the best song they've ever recorded.  Looking Hot is a great pumped up track in the vain of Hella Good / It's My Life and is probably the biggest potential radio hit of all the new songs.  Hoping One More Summer gets a summer release, perfect summertime jam.<br /><br />In all, the 80's influences are really strong along with the ska / reggae / pop that made No Doubt awesome.  A must have for the superfans!

B0071BGOJC|5.0|Winter of the world, is unput down able, the tension and suspense as the story of the 5 families unfolds is wonderful to read, and having read fall of giants, the expectation when some of the characters meet , and as a reader you know the background is so exciting. Beautiful story, get it today.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love to look through Pinterest and picking out other ideas for this and that.  I love the crafts I can do. Then I also like the self fix it areas where I can fix something naturally.

B0073U2F12|1.0|obviously you are unaware, but i have not only returned this particular DVD but also hunger games and crusades as they are unable to be played on players made for australia. I am more than annoyed seeing as the address that these were posted to was also an Australian address and nowhere in the sales advertisement did it state that they were made for USA. In future i would suggest that if you are selling DVDs for a different region that your sales people check the address that they are sending to, or you put in your advertisement that they are not for certain regions.<br /><br />regards<br /><br />Les

B008NCSZQ8|5.0|i love this movie.it brings me back to when i was a kid having the action heros . the  actors  was amazing.loved how they built up each movie toward the avangers.it kicked butt.
B002O01I9Q|5.0|Love every track. Even got my College son to love it. Border Reiver is both haunting at the beginning and picks up speed like a train. Some of Mark's best work.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I was late on reading this book and I am glad I did. I am enjoyed it as an adult and I suspect that as a young adult I would have really found something special about Katniss' beautiful and brutal reality.
B00914JWSW|5.0|This is an amazing collection. This album is proof that there is no other vocalist who could perform such a variety of musical genres as well as Streisand. She stands alone.<br /><br />What's so puzzling is that it has taken this long for these recordings to be officially released. When you hear Barbra's fabulous renditions of \\"Glocca Morra\\" or \\"Being Good Isn't Good Enough\\" or \\"Willow Weep For Me\\", it's hard to believe that she didn't deem these performances worthy of a place on any of her previous albums. Obviously, Barbra has always raised the bar for excellence very high throughout her career.<br /><br />At this point I can't decide which tracks I like most because there are so many standouts. I can't wait for her to unearth more treasures!
B000FCKC4C|5.0|The Alchemist does what it promises, transforms mere words on paper into gold in your hands. This is a great story for the ages, a story we all know at some point but have forgotten.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|I can't say enough about this movie.  It is touching and informative on so many levels.  I was truly surprised at what an excellent film it was when I first watched it on Netflix, then realized I had to own the DVD.  Such an inspirational movie is lost among today's action films.
0316223239|3.0|I'm not sure why this book is so well reviewed.  I didn't think it was written overly well, even if it is written from the view point of a child (Jack, age 5).<br /><br />I thought some aspects of the book weren't overly plausible the biggest part of this was that she was abducted at 19 by a man using a tactic that would trick a child but not a 19 year old woman.<br /><br />I also didn't like the inconsistencies in the verbiage used by the author.  She based the novel in the US but she frequently used vernacular that isn't American.<br /><br />I thought the beginning chapters were provocative and emotion filled but I lost interest in the story as it progressed.<br /><br />On a positive note its a quick and easy read.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Can I give this 100 stars.  Great album.  I didn't think they would be able to top Sign No More.  I was wrong.  Keep them coming Mumford!
B0056CUZRA|4.0|The story and charactors draw you in from the opening chapters. Also historic war references are interesting and disheartning as I lost my Great Grandfather in the so called \\"Great War\\".
1608193381|2.0|I listened to a podcast of a lecture by Ha-Joon Chang at the London School of Economics.  While i disagreed with most of his comments, he seemed thoughtful and I thought his book might sharpen some of my thoughts.  In his introduction, he tells the reader that he intends to debunk free market economics.  To his credit, he occasionally make some sound observations. And at various points, he acknowledges that there are multiple ways to look at an issue and his way is not the only way.  But as others have noted, he often relies on setting up straw men that have nothing to do with free market economics and then picks on them.  Let's run through his 23 \\"things\\":<br /><br />\\"Thing 1:  There is no such thing as a free market\\"  The author points out various voluntary rules & boundaries as some kind of gotcha.  And he discuss immigration controls as if everyone who believes in free markets also believes that closed borders are good.<br /><br />\\"Thing 2:  Companies should not be run in the interest of their owners\\".  The author makes many thoughtful comments about the perverse incentives created by corporation laws.  But he seems to assume that everyone agrees that corporations are an inherent by-product of free markets.  Corporation, whether you like them or not, are a product of government laws, not the market.<br /><br />\\"Thing 3:  Most people in rich countries are paid more than they should be\\".  The author blames most of this on immigration controls, not productivity.  Here he makes his first of many correlations that he tries to convince us are causes.  He may be correct that immigration controls have some impact here but immigration controls are not a feature of free markets.<br /><br />\\"Thing 4:  The washing machine has changed the world more than the internet has\\".  The author again makes thoughtful comments here but this topic has nothing to do with central planning vs free markets.<br /><br />\\"Thing 5:  Assume the worst about people and you get the worst\\"  This isa convoluted discussion that attempts to disprove Adam Smith's thesis of the invisible hand.  The author suggests that because most people don't cheat that they must not be driven by self interest.  He seems to think that when people are honest that they must not be self interested.  Very weak thesis, in my opinion.<br /><br />\\"Thing 6:  Greater macroeconomic stability has not made the world economy more stable\\"  Here the author suggests that government efforts to minimize inflation are counterproductive.  A topic with different points of view, for sure, but again has nothing to do with free markets.<br /><br />\\"Thing 7: Free-market policies rarely make poor countries rich\\"  A weak discussion that again confuses correlation with causation.  He discusses the tariffs imposed by the USA in the 1800s and suggests that this proves how protectionist it was.  He fails to note how small the US federal government was at that time nor that tariffs were primarily a revenue generator not a trade control mechanism.<br /><br />\\"Thing 8:  Capital has a nationality\\".  A slightly interesting discussions of the incentives of transnational corporations.  Again, nothing to do with free markets.<br /><br />\\"Thing 9:  We do not live in a post-industrial age\\".  Another slightly interesting discussion of the evolution of manufacturing & services in various countries.  The author makes sound comments about the continuing value of manufacturing.  But again, this has nothing to do with free markets.<br /><br />\\"Thing 10:  The US does not have the highest living standard in the world\\".  Here is one of his most audacious straw-men.  he seems to assume that the US has the most free market system.  Then because of this assumption, he suggests that because the US does not have the highest standard of living, that proves the fallacies of free market economics.  A recent study published in report\\" Economic Freedom of the World\\" notes that US now ranks 18th in terms of economic freedom, behind such countries as Finland & Denmark & Switzerland.  In other parts of the books, these countries are highlighted as proof that more centrally planned economies are better.<br /><br />\\"Thing 11:  Africa is not destined for underdevelopment\\".  A convoluted effort to suggest that most of the under-performance of economies in Africa are caused by IMF and World Bank requirements to open up their economies.  More correlations packaged as causes.<br /><br />\\"Thing 12:  Governments can pick winners\\".  A few anecdotes of successes of state owned enterprises and other organizations that were helped by governments.  Sure, ok.  But no rigorous effort that proves that governments are better at picking winners than the market.<br /><br />\\"Thing 13:  Making rich people richer does not make the rest of us richer\\"  Here he makes an effort to suggest that more progressive tax system is better than a less progressive tax system.  Interesting discussion, i suppose, but again unrelated to free markets.<br /><br />\\"Thing 14:  US managers are overpriced\\"  The author seems to assume that executive compensation in the US is only a byproduct of a free market. He makes no attempt to discuss the impacts of corporate laws, financial regulations, etc.<br /><br />\\"Thing 15:  People in poor countries are more entrepreneurial than people in rich countries\\"  A sound premise, actually.  But then he discusses the distinctions between individual vs. collective.  He seems to assume that collective entrepreneurship can only happen as the result of central planning and seems to discount or ignore voluntary associations.<br /><br />\\"Thing 16:  We are not smart enough to leave things to the market\\"  The author goes to great lengths to prove how irrational humans can be as economic actors to prove that markets need to be managed by governments.  Then he discounts or minimizes the impact of the irrational humans that are given the levers of power in governments.  as Milton Friedman noted \\"Just tell me where in theworld you find these angels who are going to organize society for us?\\"<br /><br />\\"Thing 17: More education in itself is not going to make a country richer\\".  Another sound discussion and very thoughtful.  Nothing to do with free markets but enlightening reading, nevertheless.<br /><br />\\"Thing 18:  What is good for General Motors is not necessarily good for the United States\\".  Again, the author confuses free markets economics with pro business economics.  The author is correct that governments should not be supporting individual companies, no matter how big they are.  In fact, most government regulations are designed to protect incumbent business from the competition of new entrants.  And that is exactly what happened to GM.<br /><br />\\"Thing 19:  Despite the fall of communism, we are still living in planned economies\\"  Now the author decides to turn the tables.  He laments all of the bad things that have resulted from current free market economics but now admits most current economies are planned.  Maybe those bad things are the result of that planning, maybe?<br /><br />\\"Thing 20:  Equality of opportunity may not be fair\\"  An interesting discussion of equality of opportunity vs equality of outcome.  He accepts the virtues of equality of opportunities and cautions against too much emphasis equality of outcomes.  No issues here.<br /><br />\\"Thing 21: Big government makes people more open to change\\"  Some interesting thoughts about how \\"big government\\" can provide a safety net that enables citizens to change jobs/careers/vocations/whatever.  He suggests that a well functioning welfare state can function as the bankruptcy law for workers. His points about the choices that people make based on their sense of security are well reasoned.  But he assumes that any welfare state is indeed well functioning and does not have any disincentives.  And he assumes that institutions that evolve under freer markets will never produce any security for those that need/want it.  Thesecurity argument is sound.  The only bigger government can provide security argument is suspect.<br /><br />\\"Thing 22:  Financial markets need to become less, not more, efficient\\"  The author falls into the trap that free markets are only a profit system.  Free markets allow institutions to profit if they succeed and impose losses if they fail.  The various \\"deregulations\\" of the last xx years around the world unleashed more profit seeking but did little to penalize losses.  the various backstops: deposit insurance, GSE guarantees, and money supply manipulations by central banks convinced financial institutions around the world to under-price the risks of their portfolios.  And when those portfolios crashed, most governments confirmed those convictions by bailing out the very institutions that took on under priced risk.  Only way for deregulation of profit seeking to work is to also deregulate loss taking.  It was mis-regulation that caused the financial crisis, not deregulation.<br /><br />\\"Thing 23:  Good economic policy does not require good economists\\"  Mostly a discussion of semantics about who is labeled whom and about why no one foresaw the financial crisis.  The author continues to put great faith in central planners while bashing anyone who can't predict future events.  so, we consolidate authority to a small group of people who can't be trusted to foresee the consequences of their actions?<br /><br />Bottom line for this reviewer:  snippets of interesting reading buried in a sea of flawed reasoning.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Love the app but 5 hours off work gone when my kindle froze and POOF by by World Of Art
B005LAII94|2.0|The first thing Savages does is to pull a punch: in a sweaty basement imprisoned Mexican workers are captured on home video suffering atrocities, off screen, at the hands of a chainsaw-wielding sadist. It's meant to be a bracer, but it doesn't quite shock because it only implies, and is followed too quickly by opening credits scrolling prettily over Southern California sun and sand, beautiful people frolicking in rolling, reverb-drenched surf guitars.<br /><br />An odd dissonance: an opening which doesn't know whether to be Arthur or Martha. It's kind of a theme.<br /><br />Over stylish fast-cut editing we meet our narrator, a girl called O (Blake Lively). O (for Ophelia, which we're helpfully informed is from Hamlet) is the fulcrum of the film, and she introduces dual heroes Ben and Chon, both of whom are her boyfriend. Dual heroes. They're good drug dealers. We meet some bad ones soon enough: the dudes with the chainsaw.<br /><br />Amongst our dual heroes we have a sensitive one, Ben (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and a hard bastard, Chon (Taylor Kitsch). They are a Cheech & Chong for the net generation: they're even name-checked that way. Only they're not as funny. They share O: it's a yin and yang thing. A Bizarre love triangle, then? Some submerged fear and loathing between the beaux? Underplayed. Implausibly underplayed. Thus the whole three-way relationship, which you would think would ooze of it, seems contrived.<br /><br />In any case, why have two heroes, if not to harvest the drama that flows from the submerged resentment between them? It is as if Oliver Stone can't make up his mind: it speaks to a muddle-headedness with which the picture is shot through. For now, though, no matter: early exchanges are slick, voguish and handsome, being not troubled much by way of plot exposition.<br /><br />Things start to fall apart when Stone moves onto that job. To do so he dials back the modish editing, but without that distraction, a preposterous screenplay reveals itself. The vibe is confused: my best guess is that Stone is shooting for Quentin Tarantino's blend of irony and brutality, but Savages isn't nearly cool enough to carry it off. For one thing, Stone doesn't trust us to be hip to his references, so explains: \\"IED - that means improvised explosive device\\". (We are told this particular fact twice.) Perhaps this is meant for viewers who are thinking of the contraceptive coil.<br /><br />Now a Roberto Rodriguez or a Quentin Tarantino would never patronise his audience in that way - he would expect you to keep up: no concessions for laggards; and when he sought ironic belly laughs he would therefore get them. In Savages, the theatre's laughter, which grew bolder as the picture wore on, was not ironic. It was embarrassed: Did someone really ask Benicio Del Toro to say that? And he did?<br /><br />Del Toro, then: The more we see of him and his cohort of Mexican provocateurs, the less menacing they are. Del Toro's accent is direct from Ren & Stimpy.  He wears a ridiculous wig. Despite doing despicable and ultraviolent things he seems content to play for laughs.<br /><br />His boss, also in a ridiculous wig, is Salma Hayek. She is a drug lord. Salma Hayek a drug lord? Good lord. Poor Hayek is way out of her depth, hobbled by an atrocious script and required to play a character riven with so many contradictions it is a wonder she doesn't spontaneously implode: by the end of the picture, fairly much, she has done. In the mean time, characters labour over exposition, frequently telegraphing it to each other - literally - over skype. But then, for daggers-drawn blood rivals, they also spend more time than I would visiting each other boldily. Especially since they're meant to be in different countries.<br /><br />In fairness, Stone keeps the pace up and the picture is never less than entertaining. John Travolta has a whale of a time as a bent DEA agent playing every angle, but this is not his Pulp Fiction of the 2010s.<br /><br />Fundamentally, the flimsy superstructure of Stone's enterprise has no chance of supporting the colossal weight of ludicrousness that Don Winslow's premise hoists upon it.  By the time we get to the most equivocal ending I can remember - yet again, Stone seems to want to have a bob each way, as if the focus group screening came out split 50/50, so he puts both endings in - the whole edifice is strewn across the landscape, a blast radius wider than one of Chon's IEDs*.<br /><br />*That's \\"improvised explosive devices\\" in case you were wondering.<br /><br />Olly Buxtontally, the flimsy superstructure of Stone's enterprise has no chance of supporting the colossal weight of ludicrousness that Don Winslow's premise hoists upon it.

B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This is one of those games that has a high rating for WHAT REASON?<br /><br />This is the most mind numbingly stupid, Boring, useless, good for nothing game I have ever seen, and it has somehow managed to get an overall four and a half star rating. The only thing I can think of that would cause this is 1) Very young kids are playing it, or 2) The people who like this game are, for the most part, brain- dead. I'm leaning towards (2).
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I have been blessed on successive nights with documentaries I could scarcely believe were true. Last night it was The Imposter, this evening Searching for Sugar Man.<br /><br />The story of Sixto Rodriguez' accidental stardom in South Africa is every amateur songsmith's wildest dream come true. Having plugged away for years in front of unappreciative hometown crowds - in Rodriguez' case, having given it away altogether - to then discover you have been adored all along, by half a million fans, must be quite the trip. A trip, in this case, from inner-city Detroit in 1971 to Cape Town, South Africa, in 1998.<br /><br />Sixto Rodriguez was (if this film isn't really an elaborate hoax, a caveat you may take as read for the remainder of this review) a singer songwriter from Detroit who came to brief notice in the late sixties. He was picked up by a label which was part of the Motown empire. Perhaps his mistake was to ply Greenwich Village folk to the people of Motor City, but in any case his two recorded records sold not at all, and he was promptly dropped and passed quickly into oblivion.<br /><br />Or so he thought: But not, as it turned out, in South Africa, where his songs had spread by word of mouth and bootlegged cassettes. Under Apartheid this Mexican American folkie became an immense underground hit. South Africa was then a police state, so this is no mean feat, but perhaps explains why there was no greater communication in or out of the republic, for Rodriguez knew nothing of this success: he didn't know his record was even released in South Africa, because it wasn't: in a story as implausible as the one about American sailors donating 45s to Liverpudlian guttersnipes and thereby educating them about Chuck Berry, someone's girlfriend came over from LA with a copy, it got taped and passed around, and before long it had shifted half a million copies. Viral marketing, 1971 style.<br /><br />I checked with a South African compadre and it all seems to be true: his music (mostly a passable, if unremarkable, pastiche of Leonard Cohen or mid-sixties Dylan) is available on line. Still, vital things are not, or only half-, explained, such as how a few ropey C90s were converted into an officially released long playing vinyl record without interaction with the artist or his label, and where the money went: the film darkly hints at skulduggery amongst American impresarios, but never gets as far as pointing a finger.<br /><br />In any case, the film's first half centres on two South African fans and their quest to find out more about this artist. Common consensus in Capetown had it that Rodriguez was long since dead, a victim of on-stage suicide, variously by self immolation, gunshot or overdose. The fans (one of whom is nicknamed \\"Sugarman\\" after Rodriguez' song) set out to get to the bottom of how he died.<br /><br />*** spoiler alert ***<br /><br />It is difficult to talk about the second half of the film without giving away the spoiler that they do eventually find a trail back to Rodriguez, and he's not dead at all - but still working as a casual labourer in Detroit. Sixto's nearing sixty and has three daughters.<br /><br />It doesn't take long before he and his daughters are flying to South Africa for a concert tour. This last part of the film is an uplifting record of that triumphant tour, where over six nights he played to 30,000 hysterical fans. Really hysterical - Beatlemania style, mouthing every word of his lyrics. I dare say Leonard Cohen never had that.<br /><br />Throughout it all Rodriguez remains nonchalant: he takes it all in his stride, returning after each tour to his labouring job in Detroit, where his co-workers are most amused to find he is recording artist at all, let alone one with a huge following.<br /><br />*** spoilers over ***<br /><br />This is a gentle, amusing, poignant tale of a labour of love and the redemption of a man who is big enough not to have been disappointed by his life's trajectory, set againsta story so remarkable you'll have trouble believing it to be true. Well recommended.<br /><br />Olly Buxtona story so remarkable you'll have trouble believing it to be true. Well recommended.<br /><br />Olly Buxton
B0061Q13V2|5.0|This is a story that had to be told and it speaks volumes about how our most talented athletes are being abused and exploited at a young age.

0525953728|3.0|Maybe I've read too many books on modern military affairs, but it seemed to me like most of this book was just perfunctory background on the SEALs that is probably better covered in other books. The reason I bought the book was to read about the bin Laden raid in particular, and it was pretty skimpy. This likely could have been a five magazine article without losing too much substance.<br /><br />All of which is to say that there are clearly no national security risks posed by this book and no secrets revealed. Had the author opened up with the secrets it would have been a more interesting read, I'm sure, but until the details are declassified I suspect this is about as much as we're going to get.<br /><br />It's clear that the only reason the Obama administration is going after the author for writing this book is that the author clearly doesn't have much respect for Obama. Obama spilled more secrets than Mr. Owen did.

B006XF5BTG|5.0|This is a great book. There is so much info about \\"bodybuilding\\" on the internet and most of it has nothing to do with the way most men want to look. I want to be bigger, with a well built chest and shoulders that make me look good in my clothes. If that's what you're looking for, this is it. It ain't easy and he'll have you training in ways that you are not used to (shorter reps, heavier weights). And the nutrition part is even harder. But after 2 weeks, I'm seeing results.
B005V4X8JA|4.0|This is not to disparage Steve Hoffman. Though I have both questioned and praised his aural decisions in the past, this particular album is a tough nut to crack.<br /><br />I bought this Audio Fidelity Gold CD because of his recent superb handling of James Taylor's \\"Sweet Baby James\\" and \\"Mudslide Slim\\". Both blew me away, and made my stereo system sound absolutely primo. If you're at all interested in James Taylor, go buy these two 2012 Audio Fidelity gold discs before they cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />Regarding this particular album, I've heard multiple formats since its release in 1969. I have a very good 90s Atlantic Gold CD (with great packaging) of this album. It sounds like a flat transfer. All the instruments sound great, but the vocals are strangely muffled, with absolutely no sibilance. I could tell they were recorded that way in the studio, and hence written in stone on the stereo mix.<br /><br />This Audio Fidelity CD, mastered by Hoffman, adds sibilance to the vocals. However, that makes the instruments sound harsh. I prefer the good instruments/flat vocals master over the great vocals/strident instruments master present on this CD. It's the lesser of two evils. The listener needs to decide between the two approaches to the mastering.<br /><br />To give Mr. Hoffman his due, he has \\"fixed\\" the main problem with this master, but at the expense of the acoustic guitars.<br /><br />Unless there's a remix of the multitracks (which makes me shudder in general), there will never be a great mastering job of this album.<br /><br />However, when all is said and done - \\"Crosby, Stills and Nash\\" is a great album, regardless of the mastering job.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|It's ok. I feel like the book was a bit rushed. The book feels like Mt. Riordan forcibly wrote the book which makes it it bit... bland.
0525953728|2.0|I read this book thinking a first hand account would have a little more grit to it than this  offered. It never delves to deeply into any of characters and I think I was looking for more of a Tom Clancy account of what killing the most sought after terrorist in the world.
B008JDAC7G|4.0|The Good: Colorful graphics, fast paced and intense gameplay, good in short bursts<br /><br />The Bad: Not enough monsters, only two modes<br /><br />Adult Swim Games makes some pretty change yet fun games, but they are all only good in shorts bursts. That's what mobile games were designed for though. MAMC is a really fun game that keeps you on the edge of your seat. This is a block stacking game that is like Jenga on speed. The game has colorful graphics, and an addictive gameplay formula.<br /><br />There are four colored blocks (condos) that you need to match up to keep the tower straight and the monsters fed. When you don't want a block you swipe it over to the same colored monster, but if you give the wrong color to the wrong monster too many times they will freak out and try to knock your tower down. Once you stack at least three you get a bronze block. Get three bronze blocks and you get a silver, get three silver blocks for gold, and three gold for platinum. This is really difficult and some times you have to sacrifice your medals to keep the tower striaght. Feeding medals to the monsters releases their powers like keeping the tower straight, slowing time down, etc. There are bomb blocks and bricks that need to be stacked around to be removed.<br /><br />That is pretty much the game in a nutshell, but the tower gets bigger and will fall down quicker as time goes on. The game is highly addictive and you will tense up trying to keep the monsters fed and the tower straight. This is probably one of Adult Swim's better mobile games, but sadly, only one of three that are on Google Play. For $1 you are getting a lot of fun, but there are only two modes; endless and time attack. I wish there were more monsters, and maybe a mission mode, but for $1 you are getting a lot of fun.
0385335997|5.0|love this series, I was sad throughout the beginning because i was waiting for Claire and Jamie to get back together and it seemed like it was taking forever. The whole 4 person perspective was also confusing in some parts but was enjoyable (and i hate multiple perspectives).
B008MEM24S|5.0|Honestly I think &quot;Where's My Perry?&quot; is the best app I've downloaded in quite some time. It has very interesting features such as the hidden duck hiding in one of the levels and the secret files that give you bonus game's.I'll give that a five-star review.

0316228532|4.0|I was excited to read JK Rowling's new novel, but then after reading many of the reviews I was worried I would be disappointed.  Thankfully, I was not!  The plot, setting, and characters are nothing like Harry Potter, but especially when I first started reading, I kept noticing similarities between her writing style in this \\"adult\\" novel and in Harry Potter. However, I made a point to disassociate this novel from her previous ones.  I think you do this novel a disservice by associating it with Harry Potter.<br />JK Rowling has a great way of making characters come alive, and as I read the novel I felt like I could picture each character and the town.  I thought the subject of the novel was an important one and Rowling did a good job making her point.<br />Did I think it was a perfect novel? No, but do I think it is good? Yes, it is worth the time it takes to read.
B0018QOIXU|5.0|All I can say is the CD is EXCELLENT. Listen to it all the time!  Adele is going to have a long career ahead of her. Great voice and the songs are from the heart.
B002RHGYOA|4.0|Quality read that takes us to the next stage of Lizbeth's adventures. We also learn much more about her past and her many skills. I found it difficult to put down.
B009FZZFME|5.0|On the details of season 3 they completely wrote the wrong date Sunday October 16, 2012. The season starts Sunday October 14, 2012. October 16, 2012 falls on a Tuesday so they might want to get that right because it seems kind of sketchy to purchase a show that doesn't have the right date for airing.
076781214X|5.0|I have always liked this movie which I first saw as a kid. One of the co-stars is Catherine Hicks who fell off the face of the earth except for one other movie until she accepted the role as the mom on Seventh Heaven. Another co-star is Jim Carey. Everybody in this movie is good and its an excellent movie. You should get it.
1423165691|2.0|What a pedestrian book!  Ken Shue's overblown Foreword notwithstanding,  one is left wondering why so little effort and imagination went into this often delayed project.
B0071BGOJC|4.0|All in all I enjoyed this book, the war scenes in particular from the paratroopers point of view on D-Day were excellent. It is clear that Ken Follett is a phenomenal researcher when it comes to his settings. Obviously from this level of research and study and his general command of the English language to get his tale across, Ken is a highly intelligent individual. However, I find that occasionally his take on a relationship between certain characters and certain plot twists are somewhat disappointingly cliched. *SPOILER ALERT* for example the scene where Lloyd Williams meets Boy behind enemy lines? You could tell a mile away that Boy would be revealed to be the pilot but still it took ages to get to the point. So much so that when it did plonk in front of you as though it was made to go TA-DAA it just made me grimace as though I was being forced to watch something very uncomfortable. Part of me was hoping that he wouldn't be Boy and we could all save some face. I also don't see why every single character HAS to be in a relationship and the set up for each relationship seems to be that the persons story cannot continue unless they have some sort of relationship with someone. Some relationships are complex and thats fine but the associated sub plot of such can sometimes come across as an irritating distraction from the main story, which for me was the collision of the different families ideals through the war. I also found some of the characters interest in politics to be so cumbersome that they came across as, to put it mildly, a pain in the ass. It doesn't make sense that such young people would want a party to be about everyone sitting around discussing the crisis in Europe. If the crisis was such a bell ringer, surely they could do with some outlet to let off steam more than ever. The last scene too was nicely thought out but badly executed. If you look at it for what it is, the final scene left one of the families awkwardly sitting in the dark?!? Overall thoughI must take my hat off to Ken Follett for yet another mostly good book that I am glad I purchased, as for the most part I found it a very compelling read, despite some really one dimensional characters.
0062127241|5.0|This is not really the autobiography we would have expected from one of the premier musicians in Rock. This is after all the composer and leader of the Who, the classic Mod, psychedelic and Hard Rock band and who also produced some really decent solo records.<br />Do not get me wrong, I do not like the Rolling Stones but Keith Richard's biography was much much funnier and had more bite. Also George Jone's biography is more rock'n'roll. However to some degree, when you read this book, you will notice that there is still a lot of the Meher baba loving peaceful type in Townshend ; this fact recurs all over the book when he osntantly falls in love sometimes surprisingly platonically. This is what makes him also much more sympathetic than most rock stars.<br />One problem seems to be that while Pete Townshend is one of rock's more intelligent spokesmen and has produced also some of its most powerful music, he here comes over a bit wishy-washy.<br />If one is used to the way Pete Townshend used to write, e.g. in the music press or even his (unintentionally) hilarious rant in the deluxe boxed set of quadrophenia, he was usually an extravagant and opinionated writer but here he comes across as somewhat too sedate.<br />The Who went from being sub-par Beatles copies to rock opera creators to a savage band while crearting at the same time some of the more musically interesting albums of the beginnings of the 70's before collapsing after the death of Moon. They went from being Mods to Psychedelic Rockers to a typical hard rock band in what is one of the more interesting odysseys in rock.<br />While it is t rue that he does write somewhat better about the period where they were probably the most prolific, ie.e from Live at Leeds to Who Are You, at the same time he does not sem able to put all these transitions into clear perspective. What is also surprising is his somewhat bohemian private life during the 70's and which contrasts wildly to the band's music.<br />Also, while the Who produced two really major pieces of music in the 70's he does not dwelve for too long onit, which is really surprising if one knows the place that hese two albims occupy in both the histories of Rock and the Who. Concerning Who's Nexr which established the hard rock sound that would become a standard for the industry and its revolutionary use of synthesizers he does not spend at atll enough time on the subject. Also, the inherent contradiction of Quadrophenia, whichdels with the subject of Modism which was all about style by treating it with synthesizer laden hard rock, is not discussed at all (Ok, again go to his notes in the box set). There is however a very interesting book on that era that is available : Won't get fooled again. I mayself am mesmerized by this period since I even went to see one of the Lifehouse concerts in London at Sadler's Well (leaving my wife alone which she still does remeber)but the book is rather skimpy on this subject. As of writing I am still debating whetehr to go and see the current Quadrophenia tour but we will see that later.<br />While it is obvious that he was close to Moon and Entwhistle, he only provides anecdotes and not enough insight into them. Again this is surprising for someone who himself used to say he would put  his foot in his mouth. Also what is evident is that he is very discreet when it comes to his wife which is a good thing. However he does get somewhat oversentimental when dealing with his current companion (I even bought her record which was kind of good even if not exceptional).<br />That is not to say that it is a bad book, by no means, it is even one of the better ones if one considers the writinga nd one can see that his time as a bok editor did him some good. It does lack some sense of transition because it does move too quickly from them being local Mod sensations to composing Who's Next. While I understand that there are limitations to what one can write size-wise this is a story that needed to be more detailed.<br />What the book lacks at times is the wildness that his band had and at times if I was not reading it on an iPad I would feel like throwing it against the wall in frustration. He has shonn himself to be a faithful friend to people like Clapton or Ronnie Lane, helping them to recover musically in difficult times.<br />Over the years there have been a quantity of books on the who : the one by Daxe Marsh was way to dry ; there was even one called behind Blue Eyes Ithink and that I bought in Oxford in 1997 and which I have thrown away but that contained more entertaining stuff.<br />I give it 5 stars because any book on Townshend and the Who deserves 5 stars and because it has to be read. He is after all a musician's musician : Eddie Van Halen sometime in the 80's in Guitar Player arted him as his favourite rythm player. He has also produced some of the more important works in rock while remaining a decent person and  this is quite rare.re detailed.<br />What the book lacks at times is the wildness that his band had and at times if I was not reading it on an iPad I would feel like throwing it against the wall in frustration.

B007MG360G|5.0|Pretty good game. Some strange combinations but very good. My son enjoys it so I do as well. Good price and good settings.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I don't think so... People who are slamming this record are just negative people who obviously never understood what Rock and Roll is about... Do I watch Gene Simmons' TV show? Hell NO!! Do I think Paul Stanley is the original model for Dr. Rockso? Most definitely yes!!! But can these guys play and write good Rock and Roll songs? YOU BET YOUR A$$!!!<br /><br /> Being a KISS fan, not a DIEHARD fan, but a KISS fan nonetheless, I too LOVE the early albums... Creatures of the Night and Revenge were great too, albeit relevant to the era... But were any of them PERFECT albums? I don't think so, but what is a perfect album anyways, if not relative to the listener.<br /><br />To tell you the truth, I wasn't planning on purchasing this, at least not immediately, but seeing as it was only $9.99, I thought, well why not?<br /><br />Verdict, I'm glad I bought the new KISS album!! It Rocks!! These guys actually surprised me BIG TIME!!! They went in and cut a no gimmicks, no BS Old school Rock and Roll record, that sounds and FEELS like that good ol' Classic Rock and Roll that has been missing from the modern day musical diet for quite some time.<br /><br />The songs are all solid, the lyrics are good, not deadly serious, but fun (it's Rock And Roll remember) and the music itself is rockin!!<br /><br />First, the guitar tones on this album just hit the spot... Warm, Rich and cutting!!! No bland digital sounding generics here... The guitars are in your face and just feel good!! The solos are amazing as well, the world needs more guitar solos!!!<br /><br />The drums are great and so is Genes bass!!<br /><br />One of the first things I tend to notice is the sound and production, it's amazing!!! No high compression BS here!! Just warm, rich analog, so anyone knocking the \\"Sound\\" of this record maybe needs to get their hearing checked because this is how ALL Rock And Roll records need to be produced!!!<br /><br />All in all, if your a KISS fan, and more importantly and fan of Rock And Roll, this is a must buy record!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! \m/Roll, this is a must buy record!! HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!! \m/
B008I3QZKU|5.0|The Killers' new album, \\"Battle Born\\" could be their most cohesive and best record to date! I noticed that the fans have been complaining about the \\"new\\" sound and saying things like, \\"It doesn't sound like \\"Hot Fuss!\\" Well, why would it? Yes, I love their debut album but I've loved ALL their records since then too. This band from Las Vegas, Nevada are so much more than \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\". I wish most of their fans (not everyone, mind you) would stop comparing every album to that one because bands change and their sound expands, and there is absoultely NOTHING wrong with \\"Battle Born\\". The first time I listened to it, I was instantly hooked! Brandon Flowers voice has never been stronger and the rest of boys have never played better! \\"Battle Born\\" is a solid rock album from start to finish. There are no fillers here whereas their 3 previous albums had at least 1 to 2 songs that were just so-so. Another gripe from the fans is this album has too many ballads. Yes, there are more ballads but you have to admit, The Killers are at their strongest when they sing and play from their hearts. But no fear, there are some hard rockin' songs like the opener, \\"Flesh and Bone\\". And there is even a cool alt-country track called, \\"From Here on Out\\". Other standout tracks include: \\"Runaways\\" (such a beautiful song), \\"The Way It Was\\", \\"A Matter of Time\\" (highly underrated), \\"Deadlines and Commmitments\\", \\"Heart of a Girl\\" (romantic as hell), and \\"Be Still\\". But there is one song that could be the best song Flowers' has ever written, \\"Miss Atomic Bomb\\". This song has so much emotion and sincerity that it's hard to believe that \\"Battle Born\\" has been so harshly judged. As you can tell, I LOVE this album, one of my favorites of 2012! Give this album a try, you don't hear this kind of music on the radio anymore and that's a shame because they are so talented and down-to-earth. Enjoy!
B00846REIS|4.0|This novel is the next 50! I felt that the character in this book are much more realistic and that the sex is hotter!! A must read!!

B008BRC7BE|3.0|With maybe the exception of the re-recorded version of Trashed ( That's why I bought it) you can pass on this CD.  Even Trashed is just okay. Ian Gillan's voice is simply not as dynamic as when on Born Again.  Most of this double CD is generic hard rock.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I have been looking at this app for a very long time,and then saw it for half off. I got it,and loved it. Know I have looked at other drawing apps bought them and did not like them one bit. I believe it can be for all ages. I highly recommend this app very much!
0525953728|3.0|I'm not a huge fan of military books and despite how much I wanted to read this book, I was afraid it would be hard to follow and confusing to me.  That was not the case.  I had no trouble at all keeping up with story and the jargon.  The book was extremely informative.  God bless our troops!
B00887490Y|4.0|DON'T read too many reviews about this movie, just watch it! If you read too much into what it's all about it will ruin the effect of the movie! Don't listen to the 1 star ratings! If you like smart, keep you on the edge of your seat, keep you guessing type of movies then this is the one for you!
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely love these books! Only bad part about them is there was an end. Would be very interesting to read more on Christian's side like the last part of the last book. Great love story and I can see why there was so much hype about these books. I could not pull myself away from them. Looking forward to possibly more Fifty Shades!

0316228532|3.0|I've only read 93 pages, but am giving up - or maybe taking a break? - from the book. I ADORE the Harry Potter series, and knew going into this that it would be very, very different. I didn't expect to love it, but I did expect to enjoy it. Instead, I've met a cast of characters, none of whom I like, and it feels like, after 92 pages, we're still in the intro.<br /><br />Honestly, I think after a decade writing the HP series, which were vibrant, full of life, fantastical, and (ultimately) optimistic, there MUST have been ideas, feelings, etc that JK Rowling wanted to explore but didn't, They were kept bottled up inside, and then, with The Casual Vacancy, have all been spewed across the page into a single book.<br /><br />I would like to know how the story ends, and do hope that I pick it up again in the future, but for now, I've got to stop reading. I need to read something I enjoy - not something that feels like a chore.<br /><br />Here's hoping her next book, which she has already announced will be a YA one, sees her back in fine form.
0345803485|4.0|UPDATED REVIEW:<br /><br />Regrettably, I own this trilogy. I have one word for James, Thesaurus.<br /><br />Good luck with your future endeavors.<br /><br />What can I say about 50 Shades?<br /><br />I just read an excerpt of this book furnished by Amazon and while I haven't read the entire book I do plan to purchase a copy.  I have read many reviews given by readers on Amazon most of which are negative.  People seem surprised that it is &#34;almost pornographic?&#34;  This surprises me as until tonight all I ever knew of the book was the title and not the specific contents or plot but still I surmised it had something to do with deviant sex.  Whilst it is not Bronte, Hemingway or any other prolific author it is still an accomplishment by E.L. James.<br /><br />I too am an aspiring author and give kudos to her for her unique imagination at penning such a graphic novel.  It is difficult to do this knowing full well there will be harsh critics.<br /><br />She also had the tenacity to write not only one book but three.<br /><br />Congratulation's, Mrs. James.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Preordered this for my teenaged daughters and was very pleased to find that the digital version was available (at no extra cost) at midnight (eastern time so here in Calif we got it at 10pm) the day the movie was released.  We all sat together on my bed and watched it on the laptop.  Nice family time.  Had a problem with the dvd, a whole \\"chapter\\" was missing.  Contacted Amazon and got a replacement in just a couple of days.  Excellent service.  Thank you, Amazon!
B0050PYNP8|5.0|Had to buy this video---absolutely hysterical. A GREAT SF film! (And very pertinent after coming off ComicCon myself!) A must buy!
0525953728|5.0|No Easy Day-afraid it would be \\"no easy read\\" with a bunch of military terms I could not understand.  Good read.  Hard to put down!
B001NLKT60|5.0|A very, very good book.  Better than the first (Dragon Tattoo) book in the series, as good as that one was.  This book kept me up several long nights reading.  Be warned, though, this adventure doesn't end at the last page.  It picks up in the next book (Hornets Nest), which is ALSO edge-of-the-seat reading.  I'm a big fan.  It's too bad that we won't be seeing any more work from Mr. Larsson.
B009AJD5E0|1.0|I had high expectations for this movie so I was very disappointed to find a rehash of the Alien legacy. The movie was well executed with good acting and good effects but yet it lacked any originality. Apparently it was assumed that only people living in a cave for the last 20 years would watch this movie. A lot of money and time could have been saved by just splicing old sci-fi movies together with no loss of entertainment value.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This is my second favorite calculator app for the Kindle Fire.  I like the easy way you can make it switch from a simple calculator to a scientific by flipping the Fire from portrait to vertical.  The different skins are pretty nice too.  It's scientific mode is not as good as NeoCal, but I like Calculator Pro's simple mode quite a bit for more mundane calculations.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Excellent game. I can't believe it was only $1.99. Good graphics with a good storyline. Can't wait until the sequel is released.
B0098VYCCE|4.0|This was a lot better than I thought it would be.  While I didn't like Kristen Stewart, like usual, I thought everyone else did an amazing job.  Charlize Theron was AMAZING! Not many people could have pulled off such a psychotic character so well.  It was so believable.  Also, I loved the story.  It wasn't just your basic Snow White tale.  It went further.  Plus, the dwarfs were adorable and heroic.<br /><br />The only thing I didn't like was **SPOILER** in the end, you don't know who she chooses!  I have a feeling it was the Prince, because he's a Prince, but it definitely should have been the Huntsman.  Also, I didn't feel much love from Stewart in this movie.  She didn't do a very convincing job with either the Prince or Huntsman.<br /><br />Anyway, I would recommend it :)
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Highest recommendation!<br /><br />Incredibly engaging and intelligent SCI FI - beautiful special effects, masterful and subtle use of 3D, mind-blowing set design and CG...<br /><br />best of all, it is filled with terror and suspense, and genuinely scary. Fabulously frightening... GET YOUR COPY ASAP!
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|jetpack joyride is the most addicting game evr!!!!! My friend showed it to me on her ipod and i have loved it evr since!!!!!!!!
B009B53LA6|5.0|Well worth the wait, so happy with this! Plus Amazon's downloads are so much cheaper than others... Completely happy with the CD!
B0086DB566|5.0|The kids loved it and we did too. A great family movie that everyone enjoyed. The setting is beautiful and the characters are great!
B0017P520U|4.0|A nice rendition of the classic story, with the added bonus of Angelina candy!  It's hard to believe it's an animated movie at times, as it's done so well and it draws you in.  If you like this movie try Beowulf and Grendel, a live action movie that's very well done!
B008Y2IU12|5.0|I had to run out and buy this. Not only is Kristen Steward awkwardly perfect for the role, buy Charlize Therone as the witch was mesmerizing. And Thor as the huntsman, who could ask for anything more. Beautiful settings and exciting story lines. I recommend watching it and then buying it!
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Loved it as much as their first one.  I've had hipster friends criticize it for 'not being daring or new' - but when you have this kind of sound - why change it?  I love their mix of bluegrass with alternative rock.
B008673ZAQ|2.0|****Spoilers Below***<br /><br />I too am going to me in the minority with this book. I didn't really love or hate the first book and hoped my feelings on it would change with the second book. So its final..I despised this book. This book is the same reason why I hated Fifty Shades of Grey. I read this book because I was mislead by the reviews that this book was better. Does any author out there have any idea what a true dom/sub relationship is like?? I HATE the fact that these so called dom's are like this because of some childhood abuse. And these so called women make excuses for them because of it. Why do authors feel the need to connect the two? Why can't a man and a woman have a sub/dom relationship without some childhood sexual abuse or trauma attached to it? Gideon is so damaged he should NOT be in a relationship. Eva and Gideon's relationship is sooo toxic. It is solely based on sex. This is not a relationship. There is no respect, no trust and wayyy too much controlling and not in a good way. This is purely a take take relationship by Gideon. Im going take what I feel is mine and don't expect anything in return. I'm going to lie to you, cheat on you and make you feel like an idiot for even questioning why I do these things. You are on a need to know basis and when I get around to it I may or may not confide in you. And don't get me started with Eva. A woman so traumatized by her childhood that she thinks a man can F[***] her clean. Is she serious? Apparently she thinks that also works when she cheats on Gideon.<br /><br />I still have NO idea what all happened to Gideon as a child. Because we the readers are also on a need to know basis and apparently we don't need to know and are just suppose to accept the fact that it was bad and therefore, that excuses his horrific treatment of Eva. There are still wayyy to many unanswered questions and to top it off it ended with Eva saying to Gideon \\"Im going to marry you\\" Is she out of her flipping mind??? You just find out that your on again off again boyfriend just murdered someone and your first thought was \\"oh man I've got to marry this one\\"???<br /><br />Unfortunately this is the same reason why I hated Fifty Shades of Grey so much. To try and relay that if you love a man enough you can change them. Or shall I say the love of the \\"right\\" woman and you can change a man. This is why so many women live in toxic and abusive relationships. Because they always believe they are the \\"right\\" woman. I am still on my quest to find a erotic novel of a true sub/dom relationship that is not based on lies, cheating, abuse, rape and not surrounded by childhood abuse. Wish me luck :)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|lots of fun. reminds me of days on boardwalk down the shore playing at the arcade. can be addictive though
B0014BY72Q|5.0|Great movie.  Very advanced for the time it was made.  Very futuristic in the sets and overall feel of the movie.  A must see for the sci-fi fans.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|Good, not great. Well written. Wish there were more books! Maybe someone can get \\"in Larsson's head\\" and continue the saga. Fascinated by his characters but  still hanging with several of them!
0525952926|2.0|While I haven't finished this book and don't intend to waste my time finishing it I would like to comment on it to warn others.  Don't buy it, take it from the library first then if you like it purchase it.  I can't believe he wrote this.  I was only a quarter into the book when I realized it wasn't going to get any better and the writing wasn't improving and the characters weren't developing into believable people when I decided I had better things to do with my time then plow through this book.  Fall of the Giants was a magnificent book and I have recommended it to many friends and some strangers.  This one is written like an amatuer wrote it.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I luv M&S. I think they are the best band around currently. I would def recommend getting the delux cd
B0017P520U|4.0|Excellent movie, lots of action. Really keeps your interest. The animation is awesome. Definitely entertaining Would recommend to a friend for sure.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|All I can say is Wow! This book is pretty steamy and anyone who is easily offended by \\"different\\" sexual preferences should NOT read it. If  you have an open mind though, it is engulfing! I love it and find it hard to put down. I can't wait to finish it and find out the outcome for poor Ana!
B008G12ERC|3.0|I'm actually quite dissapointed in it. I've only listened to it twice now, so my opinion may still change (though I haven't had any interest in playing it lately). Overall it's not a bad album, but the move to a Brittany Spears feel (Madness) is annoying. I find that he's focussing too much on his singing with this one (with little originality and differentiation), and there's less clever, more forced orchestration of the vocals.<br /><br />so far, this is where I stand...<br /><br />1. Supremacy... good opener, but not their best work<br />2. Madness.... terrible song; feels like the newfound fame is getting to them<br />3. Panic Station.... decent, but feels forced to me<br />4. Prelude.... very nice orchestration<br />5. Survival... on the fence with this one. This may be a dislike by me, but I can see this becoming a fav of mine after a few listens<br />6. Follow Me... annoying as hell; what's with the faux dub-step???<br />7. Animals.... Great song!!! Best of CD imo<br />8. Explorers... again, why the shift to cheesy electro beats? Boring song, but then again I've never been a fan of Muse's ballads<br />9. Big Freeze... Good song, nothing spectacular though<br />10. Save Me(Bass player wrote and sings this and track 10) ok opener, but this song really does pick up. Very good indeed, though the lyrics are cheesy<br />11. Liquid State... Great Song!! This one jams all hell! Second fav on CD for me<br />12. 2nd Law: Unsustainable.... love the classical orchestration. When the dub-step kicks in, my initial reaction was WTF?!?! and WHY??? After a few bars, I changed to THIS IS AWESOME! It really does work merging the classical with DS sound.<br />13. 2nd Law: Isolated System... very good classical piece with some beats thrown in to close the album<br /><br />I personally don't like the popiness of the album by throwing in today's passing fad of dub-step and electo-pop beats, and I feel the anthemic nature of the band has been compromised. There are some gems for sure, but overall it feels week.<br /><br />3/5 stars for me.... but this may very well change over time.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Like the second book the author seemed to have issues with how to Segway from one point in the story to the next. It reminds me of the math cartoon where \\"a miracle happened\\"
B000YDAYHC|5.0|These boots were a gift for someone who normally wears a size 12; however after reading many reviews and seeing that this boot ran larger than normal, I ordered an 11.5 and they fit him perfect! They are very sharp boots and the fit (according to him) is very comfortable!
B003O86FMW|4.0|All of these books  after the original seem to reach a point where the author says\\" now what?\\" and just makes a jump to another part of the story. Interesting reading although rather patchwork in places.
B008Z9YLV2|2.0|For some reason, I have noticed that Amazon streaming (I have a Roku) is slower and sometimes just stops.  Netflix does not have this problem.  And neither does Hulu.<br /><br />Otherwise, the movie selection is pretty good (thought I have found movies and TV shows that cost me on Amazon for free on Hulu and/or Netflix) but there are newer ones sometimes that I can pay a small amount and watch on Amazon, which is nice.<br /><br />I also have recently gotten onto Vudu and Epix and at times their movie selection is bigger.  But, I must say, the Price membership is still worth it because of all of the other benefits that one gets (free shipping and so on).<br /><br />I forgot to mention the movie.  I loved the books, and, as usual, the movies are usually not as good.  There were a few things left out, but how can one make a movie exactly like the book; almost impossible, books will always have more details so when I read a book and then see the movie, I am prepared for that.  That said, I really did enjoy the acting.<br /><br />Though, I must say, I was disappointed that Josh Hutcheson was Peeta - I felt Chris Hemsworth was a better choice and that the roles should have been switched. But whatever, they were all very good actors and I couldn't have asked for more.<br /><br />MUCH better than the Twilight series movies; I will be seeing the rest of The Hunger Games movies when they come out, but the Twilight series lacked good actors and totally ruined the books.  The Hunger Games did very well. I really enjoyed the Twilight books and despised the movies (they should have, in my opinion, picked people who could act).  But I am just speaking for the first movie in that series, never did see the others. IMO.<br /><br />As for The Hunger Games, Jennifer Lawrence was awesome, as was Donald Sutherland, Elizabeth Banks, Woody Harrelson, etc.  Great cast choice (people who have actual acting abilites) makes for a way better movie! But, this is all just in my opinion.
B005ZUR724|5.0|if you were to take all the bad annoying stuff out of world of warcraft and keep the good it would be this. dont waste your time and money on other games this is awsome and unlike everyother game its endless no short story bull crap. love this game just wish there were more races but other then that its a masterpiece the graphics are amazing and no lagging either.
B008CP93S0|1.0|Only one word, awful. The only thing positive is that it shows just how screwed up the hippy movement was.  I was in my teens when that experiment began and I was totally turned off.

B006MW3V6U|5.0|Had seen a few episodes but didn't get to keep up with the rest. Downton Abbey is fabulous and love being able to view episodes in marathon style!
B008QE9VJI|4.0|By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, Mississippi<br /><br />Occasionally when I was young, and home sick from school, I would click on Dark Shadows. I never kept it there -- it was just another soap opera, as far as I was concerned.<br />Dark Shadows, the movie, is much different. It's directed by Tim Burton, the creator of the current top movie,  Frankenweenie.<br />It stars Johnny Depp and the inclusion of this director and mega-star are what make it worth a look.<br />The story revolves around the Collins family who migrated to Maine and set up a fishing port, naming it Collinsport.<br />When a teen, the son, Barnabas Collins (Depp) subduces the family maid, Angelique Bouchard (Eva Green). He regrets his decision and tells her he doesn't love her. That would be bad enough to tell any woman, but in this case she's a witch. She decides to put a curse on him, if he won't be with her he won't be with anyone.<br />He falls for Josett du Pres (Bella Heathcote). Angelique puts a spell on his true love, causing Josett to leap off a cliff. Heartbroken, Barnabas follows her, but he doesn't die, he comes back as a vampire.<br />Angelique then rials up the townspeople telling what Barnabas is, and what he's done to Josett.<br />He is captured and buried alive, only to be dug up during construction 196 years later. The best part of the show is Depp's reaction to this new century he has landed in.<br />It's quirky, funny and has a neat performance by Alice Cooper but Burton seems to search for a way to end the show.
B000Q04XDY|5.0|Very useful book, for getting to know the people who want to take-over the world, in the name of their perverted \\"Prophet\\".
B005K17RU0|5.0|love this app! it is detailed and has a great presentation. it also puts the present temp in top left of my Droid. I uninstalled my old Weather Channel app because it kept freezing up.

B0097GVJWQ|5.0|not really being one to sit and read a book&hellip;my wife got me hooked on this kind I of what I called &quot;interactive reading&quot; .  the combination of some optional reading and puzzle solving and memory excersizes have really gotten me into discovering the capabilities of these tablet devices and the enjoyment that goes with it.  cant wait to start the next one!!!
B001JDS7CU|5.0|These are the best documentaries about our wonderful planet ever. Highly suggest buying these for your collection. Buy them all.
B005USZML4|4.0|I was halfway through the book before I realised it was a childrens book. Nevertheless it was a good read. Good story throughout. I would recommend it for any age.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|I enjoy watching the show and being able to watch my favorite program again is great.  The VD is a good show for young people because the VD does cover some of the issues of the real world.
B005LAII8A|2.0|I have to say that science fiction movies are outside my normal viewing so this was an unusual choice.  My impression was that it was more of a thirller but that was incorrect - notwithstanding the numerous dead bodies that pile up.<br /><br />Is the premise creative?  Yes, but somewhat confusing.  Is the view of the future interesting?  It's what can fairly be called dystopian - dark, poor, depressing.....but it also shows only that part of the city in the future, with no reference to the shiny tall buildings except to see them in the distance.  The oddest thing were the heavy eyebrows of Joseph Gordon-Levitt, which made him resemble even less his future self, Bruce Willis.  Couldn't the director have tried harder to find someone who could have been more credible as a young Willis?  That was  jarring in scene after scene.  Best part of the movie:  Emily Blunt's mother on an isolated farm with a son who has more than a passing resemblance to Damien in THE OMEN.<br /><br />If the above seems choppy, then it is an accurate reflection of the movie.  Continuity wasn't its strong point but it is discussable and original.  It may also be helpful to note that it is rather slow-moving so if you are someone who gets itchy, this movie will increase your impatience.  There are several parts where nothing happens for quite a while.....and a while more....and so forth.  Then, sudden action.<br /><br />If you love science fiction generally, I think you'll like this one.  If not, give it a pass.
B00991TCOG|5.0|My wife and I bought this CD at Lindsey Stirling's wonderful live concert in Washington DC in September, and it was definitely a worthwhile investment. Lindsey is a brilliant violinist who can evoke the full spectrum of emotions with her playing. Unlike more traditional classical violin music in an orchestra setting or country fiddling, though, she has written and arranged the violin parts to be played atop a wide range of modern electronic tracks, with results that make you want to listen to them over and over.<br /><br />Some of her more recent works, including \\"Elements\\" and \\"Crystallize,\\" have explored the dubstep genre. If you don't like dubstep, you'll probably still like Lindsey's dubstep violin; she has skillfully kept her instrument's voice dominant, and used the mix of electronic voices as a scaffold upon which to play. For all the dubstep I've listened to, Lindsey's songs are in a class by themselves. She's not only a very capable musician; her arrangements and mixes are very artistic and fun to hear.<br /><br />Lindsey is a gifted young artist who is both inspired and inspiring. If you get the chance to see her perform live, go and enjoy; it's well worth the time and expense. Also check out her videos at LindseyStomp on YouTube. They're fun to watch, her dancing is joyous and spirited, and she does most if not all of her own video editing. You can't be watching videos while driving or at work, though, so get the CD - the music stands on its own without the visuals. It's well worth it.
B00914JWSW|5.0|Barbra Streisand opens the vaults and her heart with this masterful collection of beautiful songs and timeless performances. Buy two copies and share with a friend.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not put the book down wanting to know what would happen next. Great ending to a strong first story in a series
B008AT71WI|3.0|There are no \\"deleted scenes\\" on this disc besides the original ending.  Yet both the 1998 DVD and this one list \\"Deleted Scenes and Outtakes\\" where all you get is a gag reel with about ten seconds total of something shot for \\"The Meek Shall Inherit.\\"  This should be labeled as outtakes.  Nowhere on the package should it be labeled \\"deleted scenes\\" since I bought this 1) for the alternate ending tacked on to the movie itself and 2) to hopefully see a deleted musical number and a few more violent bits that we know were deleted along the way, even if they were only from a rough assembly.  Bad advertising!
B00992CF6W|5.0|My son has been dying to get Minecraft. He has a Kindle Fire.....all his friends have access to Apple products and have had Minecraft for a longtime. He was so excited to get it that I didn't mind forking over 7 bucks. I guess the game is limited but he is thrilled none the less.

B00000JGHM|3.0|Mostly, I was disappointed with the slow pace of much of this movie. Somehow, I feel it had the potential to be really good, BUT IT WASN'T. I was bored through about half of it. It's a cop/robber movie that drifted in and out, sometimes thinking it was a socio drama. The melding of these two genres didn't work. TOO BAD!
B008B11R2A|4.0|One of my expectations was that it would be similar to The xx. And it was. So yeah I thought it was good. I got this on vinyl. Chained and Fiction are my two favorites. Definitely buy! :)
B003I55BIA|4.0|I enjoyed this book because it always had me wanting more, i could never find a good stopping point because i never wanted to put it down. Most books lately end with two people from the same crowd it made it something special that they were total opposites in many ways but deep down so similar. This book was great and i recommend it to anyone.

B0053VKP8S|5.0|I've installed quite a few of these converters, mostly to incorporate Apple TV's into multi zone systems as well as connecting to older televisions. I have found that if this converter is connected to a LG LCD that the audio coming directly from the TV via a off air antenna source does not work! The HDMI and component inputs work fine. I don't have very many customers that use only an antenna and use a surround sound system. I thought it might be the converter, but I checked it on the DVD player and it worked. I ended up installing a speaker bar. I tested another converter on my fathers LG LCD with the same results. I called LG and they tried to schedule a repair person but when I told them that this happened with two different TV's and two different adapters, I was told that a firmware update may be required. Nonetheless, this device has worked flawlessly on LG TV's through the other inputs as well as with all other TV's I have installed it with.
B00846REIS|4.0|Definitely reminded me of the Fifty Shades series.<br /><br />Eva is a young woman in her early twenties that has recently moved from California to NY. She's landed a great job with an advertising agency as an assistant and is rooming with her close friend Cary. It's not long before she bumps into our leading man Gideon, and we get to sit back and witness the highs and lows of their relationship. Let's play the game of 'what's SIMILAR and what's DIFFERENT'.<br /><br />Similarities:<br />- A young inexperienced woman moves to a new city with hopes of starting her career<br />- This young woman immediately meets drop dead gorgeous, multimillionaire, emotionally<br />challenged,possessive, insatiable dominant young man.<br />- A woman or two from Gideon's past challenges the relationship<br />- A possible family member or family friend has sexually harmed one or both leading characters.<br />- Eva and Gideon can't seem to keep their hands off of one another. (sex can happen almost anywhere)<br /><br />Differences:<br />- Very sensual sexual senses (characters both express how they can't be without one another)<br />- Both have experienced major trauma when they were younger<br />- Both have trust and relationship issues/major insecurities<br />- They both are financially secure<br /><br />I can go on and on with the lists above. The only reason I continued to read this book (other than the chemistry between Eva and Gideon) was to find out what happened to Gideon for him to act the way he has been acting. As the story progresses we know that something from his past has damaged him as an adult concerning his personal sexual life, but the details have been left out until book two. I am also interested in seeing how far Eva will be able to push Gideon to get the security she needs when dealing with his past relationships (women).<br /><br />Over all the book was pretty good. Sylvia did a great job creating a world and personalities that seems real. I cannot wait for book two.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|Went to the cinema to see this film and couldn't wait for the DVD to be released.  I was not disappointed and found it even better the second time around.  It reminded me a little of the TV series 'Merlin', very dark and mysterious.  The special effects are amazing and Kristen Stewart and Charlize Theron are superbly cast.  This one is definitely NOT for the children - quite scary in places!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|JAW DROPPING, FINGERNAIL BITING, HEART POUNDING book that keeps you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next wrong step.<br /><br />After hearing so much about The Hunger Games series and how I should definitely put it on my reading list I broke down and bought it. Once I opened the book and read the first few pages I knew I was in for it. The Hunger Games series is one of the top three series I've read this year.<br /><br />Brilliantly written with relatable strong characters and a suspenseful plot, I was captured immediately. What I've found most common recently in the YA genre, specifically for the newer authors, is that the romances are rushed, the climax almost always falls short and the story line is predictable. The Hunger Games is the extreme opposite of that. I kept waiting for the obvious to happen with who would die next, what the Capitol would do throughout the games, and how the relationship between Katniss and Peeta would play out but I'm glad to say things turned out very differently from what I thought.<br /><br />I'm sure I'll be addicted to this series since I couldn't seem to put the first book down. I can't wait to start the next and find out what happens.
0606235434|4.0|I ordered this book to replace an old copy that I had and lost somewhere. This is an awesome book, and is my 4th time reading it. Master Lee's principles, philosophies, and methods never get old, and they can change your life.
B005LAIGZU|1.0|Movie is excellent but when I received it it was damaged a little. Blu Ray played fine but DVD and digital copy were ruined.
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I've read them all. So I was pumped to get this new chapter in the series. But it was painful to read as it became a puzzle throughout most of the book with a big ending. I'm a huge fan of Reacher running around off the grid, applying his own sense of justice with braun at a constant pace from about the 4th chapter on. This was not the case in this book. And at the end, the mystery was a big let down as far as I'm concerned. Is it worth the read, maybe? Will you really enjoy it, probably not.
0316044695|5.0|Marcus Luttrell takes us through Navy Seal training with a detailed insight rarely shared.  He then introduces us to members of Seal Team 10 and their experiences in the Hindu Kush mountains of Afghanistan.

This is a must read for any patriot.  I couldn't put it down.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Mark of Athena is the best book so far in all of the Percy Jackson books. I loved all the demigods together and how they worked with all of their strengths. Of course Rick Riordan has to leave us with the best cliffhanger yet. All of the action makes the never boring and makes you want to finish it in one sitting. Rick Riordan's best work yet. Can't wait for the next book... House of Hades.

B008G8SFGO|1.0|This album, in my humble opinion, has absolutly nothing going for it. Apart from the first cut (\\"Hell Or Hallelujah\\"), not one song drew my attention. I bought the CD cause i'm a KISS fan and i feel obligated to do so. For my collection. And the first song will surely go in my own compilation CDs of the band. But to me, Paul Stanley and Gene Simmons are simply not good enough composers to make a full album on their own. They might not want to but i think that they need outside writers. Some of their best hits were written by outside writers, mainly DESMOND CHILD. I know, \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\" wasn't a typical KISS song. But what about \\"Heaven's On Fire\\"? What about \\"Uh! All Night\\"? Or \\"Who Wants To Be Lonely\\"? Yes, Desmond Child mainly worked with the band during the eighties and that period isn't the favorite of most die-hard fans but, to this date, \\"Heaven's On Fire\\" is still one of the band's best success. A true anthem that's sure to be popular in concerts. Still today. Who can say that a song like that wouldn't fit \\"Monster\\"? Or \\"Sonic Boom\\" before? Desmond Child has written some of the best songs in Rock History (Bon Jovi, Kiss, Alice Cooper, Joan Jett, Aerosmith, etc...) and he is still composing hits even today. \\"Live To Win\\", a great song by Paul Stanley on his last solo effort was a hit and guess who helped write it? You got it. Desmond Child. All of the songs on \\"Monster\\" sound like a collection of fillers from past CDs. Songs that you would find on B-sides. At least, on \\"Sonic Boom\\", you had \\"Danger Us\\" and \\"Say Yeah!\\" that were truly \\"KISS worthy\\". But on \\"Monster\\", nothing. Well, just the first song but still, it's not even one of their best. Just like Meat Loaf who refuses to go back to Jim Steinman and keeps putting out insipid records, KISS is staying away from their hitmaker (Desmond Child)and keeps coming to us with lesser efforts each time. I appreciate the effort on their part but my opinion is made. Without Desmond Child, they will not survive another album like this. They need another \\"Heaven's On Fire\\".
0316228532|2.0|I had hoped to love this book, but am afraid that I found it to be filled with characters who are mired in lives that are sad and pathetic.  The adults are bitter and dissatisfied; and the children are on the same path.  I tried to feel some sympathy for all of them, but am afraid that I was glad when I came to the last page.
0525953728|5.0|Outstanding book.  Having read a first hand account of what the Seals go through gives me a solid appreciation of what they go through day to day.  This should solidify keeping our defense budget at a level that can fund our national defense.
B000002AGN|5.0|This CD brought back great memories.  This was one of the few early crossover hits from Jazz to popular music. (back in the day when an instrumental could be a best seller). Musically it is complex, a collection of unusual time signatures (for instance, Take Five is written in 5/4 time).  But it's also just good listening for upbeat daydreaming.
B000SEFCD8|4.0|Very informative book although goes into much detail about things not about dogs at times. Learned a great deal from book that I will use for temperment testing dogs at rescue.  Amazon delivery was great!

B007N5YIUS|4.0|The game is fun and takes some thinking power to figure out what moves to make to accomplish the win.  For a Grandma and her grandkids it is a blast! (No pun intended)
B007THA4FI|1.0|Snooze inducing and terminally boring. A pointless excursion into English suburban life. Too much exposition, and I am not engaged with the characters. The Only thing interesting was the barrage of un-potterlike profanity.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Truly loved all three books..great series, reminded me of some of Jackie Collins stuff back in the day.  Look forward to reading more from E L James.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I can see why some people might enjoy it but it's really not my style.  It started to get predictable for me halfway through so I'm not really interested in the other books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it looks cool but I don't have the money for it yet. I do have block story and the lite edition and is very cool. if you have the money for it, get minecraft and compare it to block story if you want to.
1439102813|5.0|I read a review on this book and it sounded interesting to hear the side of the \\"alzimee\\" instead of the hardships the family faces (which are horrendous enough).  I am close to her age and have had a few moments of \\"forgetfulness\\" and wanted to hear her side.  I absolutely fell in love with Alice and didn't want the book to end.  It was hard and sweet and lovely. I have recommended it to all my friends.  A book like this is a treasure.
B005GC8FKE|5.0|Okay- I wasnt too sure I wanted to watch this. I dont like these kind of ahows! But once I started- I couldnt stop!!! It is the best T.v. drama ever!!  Very Very addictive!!!
0545123275|3.0|After all the hype over this book, it didn't live up to my expectations. I didn't really like the characters; they didn't seem especially likeable. But my main issue was that nothing really seemed to happen in the book. Grace finds Sam and they're together, but I felt like throughout most of the book they didn't do anything until the very end of the book. I couldn't feel the passion or romance and this book just didn't pull me in like I hoped it would.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|I looked forward to the release of this album since seeing Mumford live this summer. It's a fantastic album but I expected it to be a little more upbeat, similar to their first album. I highly recommend it, but wouldn't add many of the tracks to my running/pre-game/workout playlist :)
0345803485|1.0|Worst book EVER!  My fiancé brought this book home to me after hearing all about it at work.  Apparently all the girlfriends and wives of his many work colleagues LOVED this book... so I had to give it a try.  I knew absolutely nothing about it when I first picked it up, now I wish I was still blissfully unaware that book was in existence.  This is probably the worst book I have ever read.  I am a voracious reader, and will read anything.  The one exception is this series.  I never write comments online, but I just had to give this book one star because it is SO BAD.<br />Any woman with brains, common sense, and self-respect will find nothing redeeming in this trash.  Worse writing I have ever seen published; the author should be ashamed of this mess.  The sad part is that people actually like it.<br /><br />I think everyone that liked this book should pick up a couple of classics and find out what real writing is all about.  This book is a sure sign that society is going down the drain when crap like this is considered a good read.<br /><br />If I could choose one book to be stricken from all human knowledge and destroyed, this would be it!
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I was so happy when I got my USB Cable in the mail.  I really hope this one lasts longer then my origional one did.  My first cable didn't even last two years.  If I have issues with this one also then I will not be happy.  I know the cable is less then 10 dollars but when you pay the shipping it's crazy.  I don't want to spend that money every year and a half but I guess I'll have to to power up my Kindle.
B000FC1LOC|4.0|Very interesting book.  Plays on your emotions.  I wanted to know more of what was happening, but I would have to set aside until my emotions were under control.  Keeps your interest from start to finish!!
B005LAIHXQ|2.0|Boring. I have no idea what this movie was about it didn't make any sense. Rent it from the library if you want it and don't waste your money until you know you like it.<br /><br />I thought this was going to be like the old alien movies but it was too \\"high tech\\" and didn't have the feeling of the older movies and didn't have anything to do with them.
B00834R580|5.0|Been a Sherlock Holmes fan for as long as I can remember! I have all of sir A.C.D.'s novels and even some not written by him. This modern version of Sherlock is really brilliant and even though some parts might be slow it gets even better towards the end. :)
B003H4I4JU|5.0|This book was utterly amazing.  The interesting plot, well thought out characters, and amazing setting made this book hard to put down. I personally thought Ender's Game was a bit better, but Speaker for the Dead made you think more. I will definetely continue reading the series, and I encourage you all to try Speaker for the Dead, I don't think you will regret it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is totally addicting.... love it so much fun!!!!  recomend it to everyone try at least once!!! you wont be  able. to put it down

B001E45XT4|5.0|This is one of many Gaming Headsets I ever own, they are great for the price, very comfortable, good above average sound. I've purchased this back in September of 2010, and by far this is the most durable headset I ever own, I stopped buying expensive headsets that will go bad in 2 months and I was looking for durability, this is the one to go! The cable has a special cover so it is very well protected for you to step on it.<br /><br />Overall very good product for the price, specially that by that time they were at $24.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Above average sound<br />Comfortable<br />Long cable and thick.<br />Very useful volume and mic control<br /><br />Cons:<br />None so far.

1455502758|5.0|ANYTHING by Christopher Hitchens is worth the read. Go for it !<br /><br />This site requires me to write at least 20 words ! I feel my first eleven were quite sufficient. So in keeping with the force of few words, that is....brevity.... here's a haiku:<br /><br />For those in the know<br />I now further recommend<br />Hitchens at his best.<br /><br />I hope the \\"period\\" at the end wasn't excessive !<br /><br />Yours Truly.....Ted Harazda
B008WCP2KG|4.0|Director Steven Soderbergh pulls another rabbit out of the hat with this unconventional film certain to stimulate the pulse of most audience members. While the hype and certainly the film focus is on the beefcake shots of some of our better known actors, the film has an appeal that goes much further. And for the guys, there is enough of Olivia Munn as a part time bedmate of Mike (Channing Tatum) and Cody Horn as another love interest to keep you awake.<br /><br />With all the skin flashing about, it's a mistake to think that's all that there is. This is a well told story penned by Reid Carolin about two guys. Mike is successful as it were. He runs several businesses to make ends meet but most of his money is due to his ability to properly shake a tail feather in front of longing women. He lives pretty comfortably and has saved up a nice nest egg to get him started on what he really wants to do. Design and make one-of-a-kind furniture.<br /><br />Mike becomes friends with a 19 year old dropout he calls \\"The Kid\\" (Alex Pettyfer) and his older sister (Horn). The Kid gets an opportunity to \\"dance\\" and becomes a hit. He also finds an alternate source of income (drugs) so think about the Dirk Digler story in \\"Boogie Nights\\" and you will get the drift. Matthew McCanaughey gives an excellent performance as Dallas, the owner of the strip club and this is certainly Channing Tatum's best performance to date.
B008XG1X18|4.0|so glad they finally got an app.for the fire. really like using it besides it seems to not load the first time opened .
B0099116AY|3.0|Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones provide yet another acting lesson, this time as a married couple of 31 years. Their marriage has gone stale to the point Kay (Streep) signs them up for a 1 week getaway in Maine for marriage therapy. Arnold (Jones) wants no part of it, but reluctantly goes along, bitching the whole time. While Arnold and Kay don't even sleep in the same bedroom any longer or even touch each other, there is still some deep rooted love needing exploration.<br /><br />The explorer/therapist is played with perhaps a little too much seriousness by Steve Carell. Surprisingly, the story is short on humor. The best scenes involve watching the couple squirm when the issue of sex is discussed. It's pretty much all there in the trailers but Kay and Arnold and their issues will certainly be recognized by many in the audience. There's not much of a story here, but it's always enjoyable to see Streep and Jones do their thing, this time together.
B005I4JG80|4.0|I am about 60% done with this book, but I must say that so far it has been such a helpful - and hilarious - \\"parenting book\\" about keeping perspective.  With all the noise about being perfect parents and being perfectly prepared for the arrivial of baby, I appreciate the author's well-researched - but very real - take on keeping balance and raising kids who are aware the world doesn't just revolve around them.  I know there is much more to this story, but this has been one of my favorite take aways.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|it is a good game it should be 99 cents instead of 1.99 I love Doodle God free and this should be 99 cents

1469984202|5.0|This was such a welcome discovery. I loved the consistency with the story and the amazing detail of the place. I could the see the silo, feel the claustrophobia, the burning in my thighs descending into the depths, feel an itch to ask for outside.<br /><br />This author is not afraid to work with hope and writes a story where hope becomes part of the horror itself. I won't say more because it would ruin it for others.  I wanted to read this book a thousand times over and hope that more people discover this book.<br />Such a welcome addition to my collection and I've told at least twenty people about it since I finished.<br /><br />Thank you!
B008G8SFGO|4.0|I think the songs are actually better than their recordings.  To me, the tones are ultra raw and dry and that is the thing that I do not like.  I wish there was more polish in the production and better thicker guitar tone and more dynamics in the mix.  I think Tommy did an especially good job being a co-writer all over and I think his solo song is one of the best ones on the CD.  I think Paul's Live to Win solo album was a touch too polished.... this a touch too raw... I'd like to see them doing work in the middle.  As much as I love Paul and appreciate all his hard work and coordination, I'd rather KISS use a real producer to shape the ultimate sound of the final product and really get the most out of the songs recording-wise.  I know that doesnt always work, however, all my favorite KISS albums are ones that had an outside producer.  I know KISS has made a real effort to use analog equipment and tap into a classic vibe... but... its all a touch too 70s to me... and I know from other albums that they can sound better than this (and using analog gear doesnt guarantee sounding better than going digital in any area that makes sense).  The songs earn the stars... the sound and production, for me, are what ensure it cannot be a 5 star release.
B0053O89KG|1.0|When I started watching this series, I enjoyed it.  Now it is just plain silly.  Nathan Fillion is acting way too silly for me.  It is no longer realistic and many here won't agree with me, but that's how I feel.  Too bad because it could have been better if he wasn't so darned silly acting in it.

B006QQ77F8|4.0|I generally don't like old movies very much. They seem amateur a lot of the time. This one was actually good though. The male lead is completely believable as a creepy pedophile.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|I  found this to be terrible book,very tasteless, close to being pornagraphic, and not to my taste at all.I read the first couple of pages and that was enough for me.
B001CDZZI6|4.0|Strengths Finder 2.0 is an excellent tool for ministry. If you are a pastor looking for material for your staff or congregation this is a great tool. The book is helpful because it lays out 34 different types of strengths which people have and how those manifest themselves. This will help you not only find and better understand your own strengths, but it will help you to pinpoint the strengths of others around you and then begin to see how you can best work together to maximize each others strengths.<br /><br />The Most helpful part of buying the book is the Strength Finder Test code which comes with a new book and allows you to take the online test which will then tell you your top 5 strengths and give you helpful detailed information beyond what is found in the book. The code is only good once so each person who wants to take the test will have to buy their own copy. Because of this, don't buy this book used. You want to get the whole package of book and test.<br /><br />Overall this is a great resource with a lot of potential for ministry and dealing with conflict and even could be very helpful in pre-marital counseling. I was pleased with the information I received and I am sure this is something that I will go back to in the years to come as I do ministry.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I adore this book in love with the whole series I am sad that it is over .This author is amazing .Its a fairy tale and fun to read about how the other half lives or how we imagine they live and to be loved like this oooh lala!!!!
B009B50QOU|5.0|In typical Green Day style and fashion, they again have created a GREAT album!  I am looking forward to the next release in the trilogy \\"Dos\\".
B0098VYCCE|2.0|First of all, when I saw the trailer in which the always terrible Kristen Stewart is more fair than Charlize Theron, I decided not to even watch the movie. I later caved in and unfortunately watched it. If someone had cut out panoramic pictures and screen sets from the movie, it would have been significantly shorter. Also, there were no emotional connections to any characters other than the evil queen and at times the huntsman.Overall, a very boring and anticlimactic version of this classic tale. Literally NOTHING exciting happens.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I haven't had a book that I didn't want to put down like this in a very long time. Lots of twists! I'm reading this author's other novels now. not quite as good but still more entertaining than I've read in a long time.

B005LAIHY0|5.0|Where do I start? Do I praise the visual effects and amazingly detailed sets? Do I call out the haters and point out that the bulk of their complaints were based on the movie not being what they thought it'd be? What about the epic 7.1 soundtrack and score? The ferocious Noomi Rapace? The synthetic David? The fact that the Prometheus ship looks like a Firefly on steroids? There are a few hundred reviews that wrongly wax on plot elements and acting. Here's the film AND the BD review:<br /><br />This IS an ALIEN movie. We are watching the start of it all. While the film takes place in the same meta-plot, it is easy to see the creatures presented being some how related to xenomorphs... maybe with a dose or two of Cthulhu mentality - tentacles a plenty.  The BD release has some great features by way of deleted scenes (some that might have done better to have been kept in the film), commentary tracks (Ridley Scott pretty much narrates the film, but it's not as bad as it sounds; he gets really excited about this film), and a background featurette that focuses on Wayland. The visuals are amazing on an up-to-date BD player, and as I said, we get the treat of 7.1 (which shook my apartment, literally, at normal volumes; so be mindful of the volume unless you want your photos and whatnots to get shaken off the walls at what you might consider a 'normal' volume). It's overpowering at points, but it sounds great despite the heft of it.<br /><br />Enjoy this for what it is - a long awaited reunion to the Alien epic universe. We're just going to be experiencing some elements that were never covered in the Alien franchise. Where does that leave us?<br /><br />Where else, but in the trusted hands of Mr. Ridley Scott. It seems this new trilogy is going to answer more than the questions left open by the film Prometheus. We're getting to see some answers that have gone unanswered for over 30 years. Key word there - some.<br /><br />I've waited this long; the promise of two more films in this series have me waiting, hopeful, that Mr. Scott can deliver the next movies on the same level that is Prometheus. Beautiful. Epic. Eerie. And more than a little... alien.n this series have me waiting, hopeful, that Mr. Scott can deliver the next movies on the same level that is Prometheus. Beautiful. Epic.

B0083SBMBM|5.0|i'm pretty sure that any man would know what to expect out of this movie. you have the combining of some of the most loved comic book figures. although i personally wished that they add Wolverine it is not a big loss. those already in it were played well, even the stand in for the Hulk. All i can say that would not do it justice is that the next Marvel movie won't be out for awhile. i enjoy watching the timeline of their movies.
1400052181|5.0|This book opened my eyes to some of the shady ethics around medical testing from not all that long ago in this country. I'm a caucasian male, but my girlfriend is black and it makes me sad to think something would be done to her without her permission.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I've been a big fan of Riordan or years, as he lives just down the road from me. His books are smart and the action is great. I really like the flaws of his main character, as they turn into his strengths, and are about learning disabilities. I have ADHD myself and this is cool.
B008XG1X18|4.0|works for the most part. only a few problems. but I love pintrest so it is worth it. especially because its free!
B002PEP4U0|2.0|This book is so much more than a story about a boys significant struggle with the wind.  This story opened my eyes to the tremendous challenges the people of Malawi face every day to survive.  As a product of farming in Texas, I have seen hard times but nothing on the scale faced by Mr. Kamkwamba , his family friends  and countrymen.  For this enlightenment I am truly grateful.

1455502758|5.0|Hitchens is a legend for his courage, his exuberance, his great intelligence, his provocations , his capacity for enjoying life, and also for something which for me is repulsive , his often ignorant attacks on the religious and his atheism. This small book tells the story of what happens to him from the time he receives the news of his esophegal cancer until the writing of his last journal entry. The book concludes with an epilogue by his wife Carol Blue telling a bit about their joint life together, and expressing her appreciation admiration love for him, and her sense of loss.<br />Hitchens mocks the whole business of 'struggling against cancer' and takes apart the Nietzchean cliche 'What does not kill me makes me stronger' He gives a brutal realistic sense of the horrors , the physcial horrors of his cancer. He talks about great hunger accompanied by a total disgust at and repulsion for food, or the disgust of a continual running nose because the hairs inside his nose have fallen off, the terrible nausea, of tens of other humiliating and painful physical effects. He writes a beautiful piece about what it means to have a 'voice' and how he uses his own voice in conversation. He celebrates Conversation as one of the great gifts of life. He includes a few hate- filled communications by those who object to his anti- religious writings. And he describes how most people endlessly misunderstand and bother cancer patients with their good- willed but stupid advice. He speaks of the surprise and shock of his impending death when set against the plans he had had about enjoying the next decade of his life. He speaks of the regret he has at the thought that he will never see England again. He keeps his wife and children pretty much out of the story , perhaps as a way of protecting them. He leaves the reader with a feeling of greater love of life in contemplation of the loss of a life of one who knew how to enjoy his life, and knew how to give so much to others.<br />True to himself and to his readers Hitchens goes out in an always interesting and moving way.imself and to his readers Hitchens goes out in an always interesting and moving way.

1451675046|3.0|This work is intended for young readers. In it Dawkins presents his view that the way we know about Reality is primarily through the scientific method. This is a simplistic view as there are many different kinds of reality and much of reality cannot be known through the scientific method.Consider the whole world of Kierkegaardean inwardness, or the varied worlds of individual literary consciousnesses. These are not subsumable to or understandable by scientific method. In however understanding the Natural world and teaching us how to transform it the Scientific method in operation for the past four- hundred and fifty years has proven more powerful than anything before known. Dawkins is an excellent expositor of scientific knowledge. He addresses some of the major questions humans have asked ourselves, such as the question of the origin of Mankind, the possible communication with intelligences in other worlds, the fate of our earth and our sun. As a major contributor to evolutionary thought he naturally is excellent in explaining Darwinian natural selection, and the process of the development of life on earth. Dawkins perhaps the world's most well- known atheist does however use one or two small dirty tricks in his presentation. He refuses to use the proper spelling for 'God' and even when talking about the Biblical God uses a small case letter 'god'. He deliberately compares the complex Biblical myths with far more simplistic and less known primitive creation stories. He makes a kind of simplistic literal reading of Biblical texts which no true student of this literature could reasonably countenance. He would have in my opinion done better simply expositing the scientific material in relation to those areas where it has relevance.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Excellent book. Everyone should read it! Far more amusing (in the funny sense) than I would have imagined. A book for life.
B003L77GH4|5.0|Love the show, The product came on the date estimated, the DVD works really good, this is a quality product.
B005LAII8K|5.0|One of the most underrated movies along the lines of Repo Men and Sunshine. Too bad these movies didn't become hits. This movie is super original with a huge twist involving a character not really seen in the trailers (i won't spoil it). Too good to spoil so watch this movie!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I have never seen the original series but I thought this was a good dark, comedy that the whole family could watch.  The vampire parts weren't too scary and I thought that Johnny Depp was great.  The story line was simple and the movie reminded me of Beetlejuice a little bit.
B005LAII0S|4.0|Moview had a unique point of view and told a great story. Good effects and the star was much more attractive than the Snow White in the \\"Hunstman\\" - after all - she is supposed to be the Fairest in the land.

0425263908|3.0|Bared to you by Sylvia Day<br /><br />3 Stars<br /><br />I read this on recommendation because I wanted a read that I could sink my teeth into and lose myself in like I had done the `Fifty Shades' trilogy by E.L James, and I was told this fits the bill!  I have to say for 75% of the book this did it for me. I was really happy with the story, the characters and  the fact that although similar, Bared to You, was not the same as Fifty. Gideon Cross is a powerful and rich business man, just like Christian Grey, but Eva and Ana are not the same. Eva is stronger and is reluctant to fall for Gideon for very different reasons to Ana's hesitance with Christian.<br /><br />The story fell off for me when `subs' and `doms' were mentioned, there really was no need for this subject to be brought up in this relationship, the book was doing quite well on it's own without all that and it's a shame it had to be ruined by half heartedly including the subject that the writer assume readers picked up that original book for.<br /><br />Giving both characters `issues' was OTT and took away the realism, it just went too far fetched and unbelievable. And Eva's reaction to Gideon's `sleep attack' was not how she would have reacted if the situation was real. Once the reader stops seeing the characters as genuine there is no way to pull them back. That's what happened to me and I am truly disappointed.
0316227706|5.0|I received my copy of \\"Underwater Dogs\\" on Tuesday and I without a doubt think this is the best dog photography book I have ever seen and I actually own quite a few as I am a huge dog lover.  The pictures in this book are unlike anything I have ever seen up until a few months ago when I, like thousands of other people, discovered Seth Casteel's website and his amazing underwater photos.  Not only are the photos themselves so unique but the clarity of them are incredible and the colors just pop!!  The expressions on these waterloving dogs are something out of a Dr. Suess book.  Who knew dogs looked like this underwater?  I will tell you who knew, Seth!  And he captures these expressions with amazing skills and what is one heck of a good camera.  These pictures are as professional as you can get and yet there is such a playfulness that it keeps it from being unlike any other dog portrait book.  As for the actual book itself I was impressed at how well the book is made.  A book of this quality could easily sell for 2 - 3 times this Amazon price.  At $12 this book is a steal and I, for one, plan to \\"steal\\" about a dozen more copies to give as Christmas presents to my dogloving friends and family.  The other thing I really like about this book is that it is a true coffee table book.  Some coffee table books have way too much writing.  Guests sitting on your couch dont' want to read a War and Peace novel.  They want a book they can flip through and look at pictures.  But as fun and entertaining as these pictures are I don't think anyone could just flip through this one.  They will have to look at each and every page as every page offers an entirely different view of the underwater life of dogs.  Some are wide mouthed, all teeth and look like sharks honing in on their prey which most of the time is a tennis ball.  Others look serenely under the water as if they are trying to discover some secrets of the deep.  While others have goofy grins that seem to stretch for miles under the distortion of the water.  There is even one very interesting photo of a yellow dog where somehow Seth captures the image of the dog's face in a bubble that the dog himself is breathing out under water.  I think other photographers could take thousands of underwater photos and never capture an image as unique as that.  How he did it I don't  know but I do know this.  Seth Casteel has mastered the art of photographing dogs.  His \\"land\\" portraits are just as impressive and I am so glad he included at the back of the book a small portrait of each dog so you can see what they really look like.  This book is an absolute must if you love dogs and I think should be one of the best selling Christmas presents under $25 for this coming season.  Bravo, Mr. Casteel, your book is utterly fantastic and as a fellow doglover, I thank you for showing those of us with waterloving dogs what they really look like down there in the deep end.

1452110581|5.0|I knew that I would love this from the time I first saw it in a cataog. I bought one for myself and one for a friend who will find it every bit as hilarious as I did.  I've lived with cats all my life, and these poems really capture the essence of cats.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I am only a third of the way through the book but it is gripping.  If you love a series that goes on forever I high recommend this one.  I usually don't go for fantasy but this is a great read.  The other books are awesome as well (minus Feast of Crows but you'll get through it).
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|the notes are organized well and the app is convenient to use. you can add notebooks and pictures and voice recordings and edit and stuff. really cool best writing app ive ever used
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I had no idea what tis was about and read it on a recomendation by a friend. I was totally blown away. I cannot think of anything that I would add or take away to better thisproduct.
B0097UO87U|2.0|Stick to \\"Let It Rock\\". That's a fine interpretation. But when the singer can't make it through the words \\"If I Loved You\\" without taking a breath in the middle, he shouldn't be tackling well-crafted classics. Paul McCartney surrounded himself with top notch jazz musicians/arrangements and used another side of his voice in his latest release of old tunes - The result was steller compared to this!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app is installed on all our devices.  No more sticky notes. No more coming up with a good idea and then forgetting it. No more &quot;what did we need at the hardware store&quot;. Try it.
B000FC12ZA|3.0|Suggested read from a friend in a book club, I was was aware of it being fiction and not necessarily a true story, although it reads a bit like one. As a story it is a bit thin, but the lessons and paradigm of thinking about our world and how we interact with each other was great. I am glad I read it, was not bored at all, and do recommend reading it as long as you are aware it may not be factual about the Aborigines and Australia.
B009329Y30|2.0|Acting was so so and Zac was good looking enough, but there was very little chemistry between the two. Story was weak and poor character development.
B009B50QOU|5.0|I've come to expect greatness from Green Day. Uno does not disappoint. I can't wait for the followup records Dos and Tres.
B009B50QOU|5.0|I have been waiting for a Green Day release!! Love this & cannot wait for Dos & Tre to drop!
0525953728|5.0|I found the book very interesting in that you found out what the troops have to endure on these dangerous missions.  I found Mark's writing to be very interesting and easy to read.  I did not feel like he gave away any kind of secrets in this book.  I think we all have the right to know about the mission that killed Osama Bin Laden.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Thor was a surprise.  It has a great plot, great character development and a winning cast.  They set it up with a long term approach in mind (anyone seen The Avengers ;), yet wrapped up this movie in a way that let it stand on its own.  It was special fx heavy, but surprisingly it didn't detract from the plot and character development.  This was no Transformers or Independence Day; this was a quality family movie that is worth a repeat viewing.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|So addictive.  Not sure why because it is so simple.  I did buy more coins but you can sell some of your prizes too.  After you play awhile they start adding up.  Just can't put it down!
0374214913|5.0|Someday, somewhere, I will find a door with a warm light glowing above it to look for the perfect book at the perfect time. This book is a treasure! It is like falling into the Alice in Wonderland between the ancients studying the great works of time and all those caffeine-driven crazies of technology who are trying to solve everything instantly. A young man in need of a job finds himself a night clerk in a most unusual bookstore. It is in a quiet spot on a nothing street, appears to run without selling anything, never advertises its wares and seems to have exactly the book that its patrons need. When Clay begins to enlist the help of his friends to solve an age old riddle of what exactly is going on in the bookstore, they all fall down the rabbit hole and become embroiled in the store's mysteries. You will ponder about the future of books, you will become nostalgic about those books you loved as a child and you might question if using all this technology isn't taking something away from our lives. A giant high-five to Robin Sloan who I hope is busy at work with his next book. This will appeal to many markets and I can see the book clubs lining up as I write this.

B000LB7G00|4.0|I'm a long-time SolidWorks and ProE user.  I've never been one to spend big money on 3D navigators, and for my money I'm pretty impressed with this device.  Right out of the box, this thing is intuitive.  I haven't even changed any settings yet, and don't feel like I need to.  The unit is nice and heavy, and doesn't slide around on my desk.  The feel of the control knob is very comfortable, and it's pretty sexy looking as well.  Now, we'll just see how well it holds up over time.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Okay I really enjoyed this second book Reflected In You.<br /><br />Yes the similarities are uncanny to Fifty Shades of Grey- lots of erotic sex, a rich billionaire, and a girl that is ever so willing to have her sexual desires met.  BUT Eva and Gideon are MUCH different people than Christian and Ana.  They BOTH have crazy emotional baggage and their emotions are complex.<br /><br />I literally couldn't put the book down and I'm so glad I only have to wait 2 months for the the last book.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|If you need a calculator app, you need this. It is truly a great tool and you don't realize how convenient saving previous equations and answers are, until it is a luxury at your disposal. This app is nice and simple and for common people,  exactly what you need.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|These are the basic eight movies in the Harry Potter series. Not many extras but are the movies as you saw them in the theater. Good quality DVDs - watched all of them and no problems. Compact case with no additional written materials.
B0091REZMW|4.0|i really like this game a lot and it is very addictive.  the only downfall is how long it takes to replenish your energy.
B0096CDG0O|3.0|I was wondering if anyone else is having trouble connecting the full version to their facebook account on the kindle hd. I had no problems with the free version but decided to upgrade. No point if i  cant use it.... Any suggestions appreciated!!! Will give 5 stars if I get connected. Its a great game!
B002KT3XH6|4.0|The incredible amount of research that went into this daunting volume is impressive, as is the way in which the author fits together the pieces of the story without excessive speculation or forays into into the realm of fiction and fantasy. The work is based upon an array of credible sources and rooted in fact,  which is the way I prefer my history lessons served up.<br /><br />That said, I think it could have been an even more compelling read had some of the intricate and occasionally excessive details been left out. Much ink is spilled, particularly in the early chapters on Katherine of Aragon, on describing virtually every pageant, masque, ball or feast the royal couple attended or presided over. Outfits worn and portraits painted are described at some length, and as they are presented in more or less the same order for each wife, tend to give the book a plodding and predictable feel. For this reason I tend to agree with the Kirkus review on the perspective that facts can feel  \\"piled on\\" . Oddly, Weir sees fit to include irrelevant, extraneous and ill placed details on the conditions of the corpses of Henry VIII (which is interjected at the end of the chapter on Jane Seymour, making it feel particularly out of place) and that of Katherine Parr, along with Anne Boylen's facial expressions after decapitation. One wonders what such facts lend to the overall story.  Macabre details aside, the one thing I objected most to  was a  statement by Weir that the King's refusal to acknowledge Mary Boylen's son as his child should be taken as \\"conclusive proof\\" that Henry VIII was not his father. I almost tossed the book down at that point. Though it may be likely that the assumption is correct, given that he had no problem acknowledging his bastard son by another mistress and would have perhaps been all too pleased to once again demonstrate that he was capable of fathering a healthy son, I think most scholars would refrain from calling this conclusive evidence.<br /><br />Afew other minor annoyances... there is occasionally a noticeable, sloppy repetition of facts in some sections, while in others Weir neglects to provide the reinforcement we need -- particularly in sorting out the identities of a confusing parade of Dukes, Duchesses, Earls or Ladies mentioned in passing in early chapters and then reintroduced later on without further hints as to their identity. Examples - we are told that the Privy Council kept the young King Edward VI short on funds at least three or four times within a few pages of each other; earlier, when Henry suspects Anne may have been responsible for death of the Duke of Richmond,  there's a question on the readers mind as to who that is since it is only mentioned once considerably before this section that this was the title given to King's illegimiate son by an early mistress. A more thorough editing job should have eradicated these somewhat annoying yet minor issues. Last and most disappointing, the book fades out on a decidedly weak note with the details of the funeral of the one last surviving wife, and arguably the least interesting, Anne of Cleves.<br /><br />A mixed bag of engaging character development interspersed with suspenseful episodes and monotonous detail, the book is a must read for those who desire a highly detailed accounting of the lives of Henry VIII's wives. Though I have not read M. Loades book on the same subject, having skimmed a bit of it I would suggest this as an alternative to those who appreciate a much faster pace, written by a recognized expert on the subject who has spared much of what some might consider frivoulous details.
B0098XY5VK|3.0|Awesome and addictive game, but then came to an end and couldn't buy full version thru my kindle and when I went on here to look for it, could not find the full version at all...so my question is where is it and where can i buy it for my kindle???!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|this book is the last in the christian trilogy so far, and I have read all of them.  They are not only provocative reading, but a great love story.  I couldn't put them down.
B0041I0N9A|5.0|My son has been asking for this particular Lego set for a few years now and we finally got it for him, and he absolutely loves it.  It will take awhile for him to finish it, but he is very proud of it and is working hard on it.
B000FC13Y0|5.0|Neil Gaiman writes stories of many different kinds. This is, by far, the happiest, nicest, prettiest story I've read from him. It is a fairy tale, written almost by the rule. But, being from THE Neil Gaiman, it had to be terribly epic as well.<br /><br />This book is... it's fantastic by all the definition of the word. It's about what happens in the lands where fairytales come from. About how the people from our world vaguely interact with them. About how our lullabies are songs of great power or wisdom in 'that' world. It's a story about betraying princes and lost heirs to the Throne. About immortal love. About secret wars.<br /><br />I'm not exaggerating. It's all in there.<br /><br />This book also has that \\"that\\" which made The Lord of The Rings, epic. There are lots of charactes that come in and out of the story. Characters with backgrounds you can almost glimpse, before they flee into the background once more. You can almost feel that world, behind the main story. A living, breathing world.<br /><br />Written in perfect victorian style, it's a story you won't be able to put aside, so I recommend the reader to be ready. Don't start this book if you won't be able to finish it immediatly. For every minute you pass not knowing what became of young Tristran Thorn, will be a minute of wishing you didn't stopped reading.<br /><br />For remember...<br /><br />Tristran Thorn<br />Tristran Thorn<br />Does not know why he was born<br />And a foolish oath has sworn<br />Trews and coat and shirt are torn<br />So he sits here all forlorn<br />Soon to face his true love's scorn<br />Wistran<br />Bistran<br />Tristran<br />Thorn.

I ripped it for my ipod (sorry Robert, cant afford 2 copies).<br /><br />Very Highly Recommend this Album!
B001LF3YQK|3.0|I was disappointed by quite difficult opening and the fact, that the box does not prevent drying out the wipes - it does not seal.

B000OZ0NXA|5.0|First Jack Reacher novel.  I am glad I choose it as it does bring to light something about Jack's family - he has a brother which I did not know about until I picked up this novel.  Plot is complicated but holds my interest!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I love nothing more than a book that sucks me in from the first paragraph, and leaves me aching for more after the last. Gillian Flynn's writing style is intense, gripping, intelligent and darkly humorous. I often look at couples and think \\"those two people are together because they are both completely crazy.\\" Gone Girl takes that to a whole other level.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|If you like going to the fairs but hats spending the money then your in luck this is the game for you. I remember this game a lot when I was young.

B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Not what I was looking for. Do not care much for this mag jong game. Looking for a more classic game with tiles easier to see and better differences.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Another winner for Lee Child. I do wish he would turn some of his books into movies. I do realize it would probably be hard to find someone 6'5\\", 250 pounds to play the \\"Jack Reacher\\" character, but come on there must be someone out there. I must offer these words of encouragement to Lee Child. Please write faster. I am now reading them faster than you can write.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I play this several times a day! Reminds me of when I was a kid. I like opening and having 50 coins to play.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I laughed and cried my way through the first book in the series and the author has done a great job once again.  I have fallen in love with the characters and I had to keep reading to know what happened. EL James has created likeable characters that I can relate with.  Yes, there is sex but there is also a story line.  I would love to see a cable channel pick up this series so they can continue telling the story.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|The book is really sane with hands-on advice for becoming great organisation, company, even person. Basic, but not always obvious principles of managing (anything, even your own life) based on tremendous research.<br />I'd advise it to anybody, even not in business, for gaining an overview how changes happen and what are wrong and right steps and understanding of this positive change process.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I was expecting more, story was slow and drawn out. The action really did not start until at least half way through the movie. It was ok.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|I like this movie. It had plenty of action and was NOT slow moving.<br />Yes, they had a little to much whining from some of the Super heroes.<br />But that is the down side of the liberal Hollywood we have to suffer with.<br />Note to all the Hollywood directors and producers, we have no need or desire<br />for you to try and teach us lessons of life. We pay to be entertained. We don't<br />give a crap about your opinion on any damn thing.
B00992CF6W|5.0|all in all I highly suggest this app. It is not as cool as the full version but you can expect that since it's an app. This app enables you to play minecraft wherever you are and requires no internet. Doesn't crash a lot, and does have survival mode with creepers, spiders, zombies, and skeletons. Minecraft fans: get this app!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice app for your Kindle Fire.  It's worked well for me so far without any issues.  I'd recommend it to anyone.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Where will book three in the trilogy take us? I am looking forward to finding out. The saga of the changing fortunes of the protagonists is 20th century history in 'novel' form and makes for enjoyable, engrossing, reading. Thank you Mr. Follett
B0053O89XI|5.0|Amazon was extremely prompt in shipping. I actually received my copy a full day ahead of time.<br /><br />As for the content itself, what can I say? I love The Big Bang Theory and for me they can do no wrong.  I can't wait for season 6!
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Enjoy playing game late at night after work.  Great way to wind down.  Hard level are a little challenging.  Works great on my Kindle Fire no problems at all.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Bizarre story.<br />Hope young impressionable people do not think  the behavior of the main character is excusable.<br />He's ill.<br />Friends say the next two books are better.<br />I will never know. Won't waste any more time finding out.
B003V63VNI|4.0|The music on the album is 5/5<br /><br />The way it was recorded sounds distorted and pretty bad.  I know BB was trying to get that raw, dirty, organic sound, but it really washed out the music in a shitty way.<br /><br />The CD should be remastered and re released.<br /><br />I hope BB learned his lesson and his next record will sound cleaner.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoy this album.
B0086700CM|5.0|I can't stop playing this! Even my 10 and 3 year olds love it!!!!! I wish there were more games similar!! Please let us know if there are.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun game. The entire family has enjoyed playing this one. I suppose it is good there isn't an endless coin supply , that makes you think how to play rather than dropping random coins.
1400069289|5.0|The book paid by itself by page 13. This is the type of book that must be read many times.
B004HUE57S|5.0|It's the most natural feeling mouse I have used.  Had to adjust down the sensitivity a little.  It keeps you arm and wrist aligned in a natural position.  The tension/pain in my wrist and arm have almost gone away (only a few weeks into using it).  Prefect for working a mouse for 10+ hours a day.

B005LAIHSQ|5.0|Since it was announced that a movie with Kristen Steward and Thor, sorry couldn't help my self, I had to see it. The trailer was incredible and the music awesome. The day that came out I saw it immediately and the expectations of what could I find where not lost. Now when it came to the DVD and I found out that there was a extended version I had to buy it. I will NOT SPOILER the surprise so if you want it buy it.<br /><br />Love it.
B008CYDDWI|5.0|This movie was even more gory fun than I remembered. Beautiful copy an laugh out loud funny. Definitely worth a 2nd look or a 1st if you have never seen it. Fun. Fun. Fun.

B000W178XO|5.0|Been looking for this to help me while on long runs for my Half Marathon training.  It's all I could ask for and more.
B003XQM2YU|5.0|This was much more realistic in terms of the era and the way people dressed and acted.  The acting was superb in all parts.  It does fly in the face of other versions in that King Richard dies in this one, and in others comes back to exonerate Robin.  It also probably showed how the court worked at that time better than other versions, and how the nobles would react in the given circumstances.  My wife -who does not like movies with violence - enjoyed this one quite a bit.  Russell Crowe and Kate Blanchet were perfect for their parts.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Love it. however I cannot find the app to buy the full version. Anyone can feel free to enlighten me.
B0050DIWFC|3.0|Interesting first person viewpoint tale. It was a creatively written story. I read it quickly, as it flowed very well. Not sure of the story line being quite that believable however. I think I would suspect something about my spouse's family if I never got to meet them!
B0094GW6YE|4.0|I was very disappointed in \\"Sonic Boom,\\" to say the least. It was so heavy-handed and self-conscious, trying to sound like an \\"authentic\\" Kiss album from the 70's. This time around, they just tightened up their formidable song-writing chops and got down to business. The songs rock and everyone is playing at the top of their game. I'm so glad they made this and didn't let \\"Sonic Boom\\" be the last thing we heard from them. This album does their entire history proud. I really love it. Thanks guys! And thanks for releasing it on vinyl with an affordable price!
B007FEFLTO|4.0|As a fan of most things that Follett writes I have enjoyed the second book in his trilogy. The story is one that keeps your attention and I found this book very well written.
B00846TTDG|5.0|This movie is what our warriors are all about - patriots who think first about what they are protecting and last about their lives. This is a well-written script with great direction and photography. I saw real Navy Seals and Marines in action and that makes me proud to be an American. I would love to see a sequal from the special forces of another branch of service with an entirely different cast that would show the depth of our military.  Craig Hermann
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great character analysis throughout. Loved how the author relied on the \\"voices\\" and interpretation of events from both the wife and husband. A good and satisfying read.
B001USHRCK|5.0|The product is great as all Lego products are.  The delivery is another story.  The vendor/distributor first sent this with another Lego box, where this products box was demolished, it looked used.  The other Lego box with it was in fine shape.  Since there was no way to determine if there if there were any Legos missing, I returned the product for a replacement.  It was a birthday gift for a child.  The replacement arrived quickly and in time for my daughter's birthday.  However, the Lego box was also destroyed.  This is an amazon distribution and there is no way to contact the seller.  The only choice is to return or exchange, without contact.  My daughter had to open her crushed box.  At 90+ dollars, this is disappointing to say the least.  Plan ahead, I guess.  Thanks Amazon.  :(
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Some of the levels are pretty easier but they are balanced out by the ones that you have to work at to make the 5min time limit.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Just as fun as the old Mahjong  but only much more colorful.  A great time killer for the doctor's office.
B004RSCWZ2|5.0|This is a wonderful collection of music from a very, very talented group of artists. I had heard Susan and Derek on Eric Clapton's Crossroads Guitar Festival 2010 and the performance was enchanting. With Revelator Susan, Derek and the band have exceeded that already high bar. The album rolls along in a pleasant trip, with just the right level of instrumentation, mixed perfectly. Oh, one more thing, Derek Trucks is a just plain amazing slide player.
B008XG1X18|4.0|these are the most beautiful pics I have ever seen. and then they have arts and crafts you can also see. Great!
B00824RJDW|5.0|What an excellent book. Since I'm millitaey the first part was a little slow. I already knew the type of entry level training for BUDs. Learning of his experience was amazing. Marcus and his fellow SEALs are true heros. And I will always feel for his losses.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|This is refreshing and wonderfully heartfelt, as well as being incredibly funny. It was easy to identify with the stories and feelings that she shares in her memoir, even though the settings are unusual for most of us. Often I would hear myself laughing without warning, then trying to explain to the clueless folks around me. She has a real gift.
B0001CNRSE|3.0|This movie did skip in places but over all i did get to watch most of it but I do wish I had known it skipped before I bought  it.
B004J4WKUQ|3.0|There are plenty of plot synopsis reviews here so I'll just put my thoughts in this review. The story is very interested, the world thats crafted is believable and vibrant, but the writing could've been better. I really loved the first act of the novel, the first few chapters got me hooked. I was very interested in the characters you can sense the adventure coming just around the corner, and there's this great mystery about the whole egg hunt. However, by the second act you no longer felt like you were going on this adventure with Wade, he was just describing it to you. All the challenges he faces are solved by dues ex machina, a lot of \\"oh I had this item\\" or \\"6 weeks ago I did this so now I don't have to worry about that.\\" There are a lot of details about how much things/services cost but it never really matters. When the last act rolls around I was ready for it to be over. There was no question at all to what the ending of the novel would be, the small amount of foreshadowing is directly revealed through dialogue, and the 80s pop culture references are just crammed in.<br /><br />I think this novel is a good but flawed. Its a great story and I hope Mr. Cline continues to write and grow as an author. I'll look forward to his next novel.<br /><br />Edit: How do you have an 80s Pop Culture novel about living inside a video game and not give some references to Tron?
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft I love this app its so cool. get this app it is so cool ( : c:
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love this app & site!  Great for finding recipes, holiday ideas, inspirational quotes and craft DIY ideas.  Would recommend !!!
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Marvel's The Avengers is one of my favorite movies this year, there's a lot of action, explosions, and awesomeness. The jokes are funny as well, and there are a number of emotional scenes in this movie too. The Avengers is clever, action-packed and I am definitely willing to watch it again.
B0058YPGSY|5.0|this is my favorite show. also the only show that my husband watches with me. i have brought all the seasons for my self and for two other family members.
B005FMZWD8|4.0|Excellent watch, am very happy with this purchase. The blue face makes a statement without being over the top. The engravings, finish and attention to detail in the casing is of a very high standard. I would have preferred it come with a dark brown leather band instead of the leather backed black cloth band, it would have made it a dressier watch; the black band is more sports oriented - bands are easily changed though.
0525952926|5.0|Wasn't sure I could remember where I left off or if this could be as good as first book.  Awesome on both counts, just enough back and forth to remind you who is who and story is epic.  Now I want the third one!!
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|We bought this video for our five year old grandson and ended up liking it as much as he did.  We highly recommend it to anyone.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|Great app thanks. Works like a PC photo editor. Had reservations but it really impressed me. I got this as the Amazon Free App of the day, but it's worth paying for as well.
B00095NX9G|5.0|I bought this DVD set and am still working through the yoga section and drills and it has been kickin' my butt.  The instruction is excellent and I've seen increased flexibility in a short period of time.  Cannot comment on the second DVD yet.  However, the techniques and camera angles used to show posture and how the moves should look is very helpful for me as I am a visual learner.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|This app has some interesting info, however the battery level indication is a lot like the DTE (Distance To Empty) on my vehicle: extremely optimistic.  If it (the battery level indicator) shows that I can listen to 3 hours of music, I'm lucky to get 1 hour.  I uninstalled; the battery icon on my phone is more accurate, so I didn't feel the need to be mislead by this app.
0425220931|5.0|This book lives up to and goes beyond expectations. Even for those out there uninterested in music, it is a well-written and heart-warming story that could inspire anyone. For the musicians, it is unlike anything you've ever seen or thought possible. A must-read!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the site, it's almost beating out google for me when I need recipe or quotes or craft or gift ideas.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I HAVE READ THIS BOOK SERIES FOR THE 3RD TIME NOW!!! I GOT MY HUSBAND WHO DOES NOT READ AT ALL TO READ THIS BOOK!!! HE LOVES IT!!!! I READ ALL THE TIME, BUT I DONT READ THE SAME BOOK MORE THAN TWICE! IM NEW TO AMAZON AND THIS IS THE FIRST THING THAT I HAVE BOUGHT AND I PLAN ON BUYING A LOT MORE BOOKS AND OTHER ITEMS FROM THIS WEBSITE!!! IM EXCITED TO BUY AND READ A LOT MORE!!!<br /><br />KIM CASTILLE
0321344758|1.0|This is just an ok book - nothing life changing. It cost me $40, then the publisher brought it down to $24. This is a $15-19 book. I'm upset I had to pay $40 for it. Asides from this personal issue, the book is ok, nice read. I would pick it used or borrow it.
B004MMEIK0|5.0|Loved the book!!!! will for sure read more from this author!!!! couldn' t put it down, and yes i will recomennd to everyone.
034580404X|5.0|Was skeptical at first about the books, just because people had mentioned they were quite racey - however, LOVE, LOVE, LOVE them!!!  They are quite steamy, but there is an awesome underlying story to it, the romance, the danger, suspense.  It's a definite FAV!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|perfect for what I need it for. its simple, its large, its perfect. couldn't ask for a better desktop calculator.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Honestly, I was suprised by how much I liked this movie. I must state when saying this that I have not watched the original series! I understand that many fans of the original are disappointed by this movie. However, as a stand alone movie I rather enjoyed it. I have always been a Burton/Depp fan and that definitely plays into my enjoyment of the flick. The \\"campy horror\\" that some viewers complain about is to be expected by Burton and he follows through. I thought it would be much more comedic and was very happy to see that while there is humor it was actually darker and more serious than I expected. Overall this movie satisfied my expectations.
0345803507|5.0|I got this book on time. I'm really please with my purchase and the fact that this book is brand spankin' new ;]<br />No pun intended!
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I was lucky and got it as free app of the day. I would recommended it even if u have to pay for it
0345803493|5.0|I got this book on time. I'm really please with my purchase and the fact that this book is brand spankin' new ;]<br />No pun intended!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I thought Bared to You was a great read...the sequel is even better.  I finished it in 2 nights and didn't want it to be over!  Then I got a pleasant surprise when I saw that there is a 3rd book! Whoo Hoo!  Like others before me have said, this story is very realistic and addictive!  Looking forward to the 3rd installment!
B0049J2CKE|5.0|I keep thinking that being a cartoon... not an adult show, but it was one of the neatest movies.... I loved it.
0446572993|5.0|I checked this book out from my local library and promptly dropped it in a puddle.  Therefore I had to replace said book.<br />The story itself is typically Baldacci, a good read, with the twist and turns he is famous for.  Service from Amazon was superb.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I saw the movie prior to reading the books and was not disappointed.  It was a page turner for sure!
B008QE9VJI|5.0|I am drained physically and emotionally, Tim Burton is without a doubt a movie maker, story writer, Producer, Director and Creator that cannot be compaired.  His genius is eternal.  Johnny Depp all of the afore mentioned and more as an actor he is Awe inspiring.<br /><br />I have watched every Tim Burton/Johnny Depp collaboration, and every Tim Burton art piece available.  Without a doubt in my mind I will watch this movie over and over again.  I have to date purchased 4 copies of dark Shadows, three as gifts.<br /><br />Please those of you out there who can see/hear my written voice stop what you are doing, get this movie, (DO NOT RENT IT, BUY IT) close the blinds turn the ringer on your phone off and watch this movie.<br /><br />The only thing I want now is the sequel, and the sequels sequel.<br /><br />I hope Tim Burton ignores the critics of his works and focuses only on his genius, continuing to gives us (BY US) I mean the people that do understand and appreciate his works of art more and more and more.<br /><br />Additionally Michelle Pfeiffers greatest vehicle to date.  Helena Bohnam-Carter pure genius.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B008QE9VJI Dark Shadows (Blu-ray + DVD + Ultraviolet Digital Copy Combo Pack)]]
B006XF5BTG|4.0|Enjoyed this book and the advice that it gives. I am a bit of an information junkie, and have seen most of the info in other books. That's not a bad thing, I mean how many ways can you explain to eat right, train and rest. The biggest confusion for me has always been picking a workout plan. Everyone promotes a different plan, and if you don't follow it, you won't grow. I have given up on finding \\"the perfect workout\\". Going back to basics, 8-12 reps 6 sets/bodypart, always strive for some progression (weight or reps). If I could make a suggestion for the book it would be to have a \\"Putting It All Together\\" chapter at the end that outlines every step from what/when to eat to the workouts. I know the holy grail of exercises is the big compound moves, like deadlift, bench, squat. For people that can't or don't like to do these exercises due to injuries or poor form, some alternative exercises would be nice to choose from. For anyone looking to get started with a workable plan, this book will definitely get you there.
1476715904|5.0|I could not put this book down!!  Such a beautiful story about two young people falling in love while everything around them is falling apart.  I laughed.  I cried.  You can't help but become attached to Will and Lake.  I can't wait to read the sequel!!
B008SVS3FC|5.0|If you've never had the good fortune to see John Hiatt in concert, you've been deprived of a music lovers' dream come true. My wife and I saw John at the Barre Opera House in Vermont on Oct. 9th. To say that my expectations had been surpassed would be a huge understatement. I'm 64 years old and have been listening to recorded music since I was five. I like to think that my musical tastes have been refined and fine tuned. It's come down to this : John Hiatt is by far and away the most talented songwriter/performer I have EVER listened to. I realize that is just my opinion, but I am sure there are multitudes that would agree. After seeing the show the other night, the only thing I was left wanting for was MORE!! Simply put...INCREDIBLE!<br /><br />Do yourself a favor. Buy Mystic Pinball and then start backing up and purchase every one of John's records for the last 30 years. It would be like hitting the lottery of joyfull musical experience. The man is a National treasure. But truly, it goes beyond that. He's a Planetary treasure. I like him. :))
B0064O927I|5.0|The strap is made of silicon so it tends to accumulate particles and dust, however it's easily cleaned using water. So everytime you go to the toilet and wash your hands, be sure to get that watch under the flowing water and it will look like brand new and shiny again.<br /><br />The touch requires you to apply a little pressure for it to work, after all, it's not an iPhone. This must be kind of a hassle for those who like to use chronometer function or need to change something fast.<br /><br />The screen color is black and the numbers are yellowish, giving it a nice contrast. The light function is blueish.<br /><br />Having no buttons, accompanied by the sleek design and stylized numbers, this watch does more than just give you the time, it's a great accessory and it looks good with many clothing you may pair it with.<br /><br />For $100, totally worth buying.
1611761565|5.0|I have come to enjoy listening to books on CD and have purchased all of the one's I own from Amazon.  The reader of 'no easy day' was pleasant to listen to and the book flowed well from the historical background to the final mission.  This is one I will listen to again.
B005K17RU0|2.0|The app looks nice...but no need to always have running. It also automatically chooses the wrong city...obscure ones at that. It would be nice if it could only keep itself straight. 2 stars for the look and feel. Quite disappointed with all the other issues. Uninstalling...
B009IEXKXI|4.0|This is a totally awesome story. I had a hard time putting it down. If you're a nerd of any kind you'll be researching the physics, the chemistry, the horticulture and the history of spaceflight as Mark Watney works through a series of epic problems on Mars. Just when things are going well, something else gets thrown in Mark's way. Man, this would make a good movie - but only if we can get Tom Hanks to produce it and someone suitably nerdy to play Watney. I'm off to look for more of Andy's work now. What a great book!<br />I read the Kindle edition (I don't know if there is a print version). There are one or two typos in the text as seems to be common in Kindle transcriptions. If there's a sequel in the works, I'll happily proof read it.
B001MDXOBQ|5.0|This album is beyond epic!!!  Laid To Rest is probably my favorite and Ashes of the Wake is not far behind.  A friend of mine actually gave me the album (the explicit version) and That's how I first heard it.  After a few listens, I knew right away the first listen that this would be a start to a very promising era for them.  I like their early stuff but not nearly as much as their newer stuff.  To my taste, this would be their debut album, maybe make an EP with the few songs from before this album I like.
B004TI5N38|3.0|Some of the themes in this book are common in any police procedural... local cops in over their head, random hostility to the outsider (aka an excuse to show the hero kicking some caveman's ass)... You also have oddly over-the-top methods of killing, and a tough chick who helps with the investigation and provides potential romance.<br /><br />But as others point out, some of this book reads so much like Lee Child's latest effort that you'll understand why people think it's fishy.<br /><br />The hero is a current MP named Puller rather than a former MP named Reacher. They're both well trained, serious, smart, and shop in the big'n'tall section. They both find an mysterious enormous abandoned military bunker in the middle of nowhere, and are stuck trying to infiltrate it with no backup except the token tough chick. Spoiler alert: bad guys are inside, and someone the hero has grown fond of may die.<br /><br />All in all, it reads okay, there's some meat to it. If Baldacci copied anything, he at least also mimics Lee Child's writing style, which means you'll want to read it even if it IS more-of-the-same. It's enjoyable enough that I burned through it in a couple of days.<br /><br />Additional spoiler alert: Ever watch pawn stars? The ending to this book reminds me of that show:<br />\\"Let me just call my buddy who is an expert in disarming nuclear bombs over the phone\\".<br /><br />While we're at it: \\"Let me just call the one living human being who knows of the secret underground passage into the bad guys fortress that's activated by a hiddens switch in the third locker from the left in an abandoned building.\\"
1451627297|5.0|This book was my first Stephen King read and it was really good. I didn't think I could get through 800+ pages and I admit sometimes it was a little slow but very well written and very suspenseful. Honestly now I'm hooked on the whole Kennedy presidency and am reading through it and of course the assassination. I don't write long reviews but trust me just read this book.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|At my wife's request I reluctantly rented what I thought would be another silly \\"Bollywood\\" comedy. Instead we were treated to a highly entertaining and absorbing story.  The soundtrack, cinematography, costuming, sets were all well done. It's presentation of human and cultural issues is both enlightening and entertaining.  This film succeeds because of a fantastic cast and a poignant and seamlessly interwoven screenplay.  There are no weak links.  The conclusion is edifying and uplifting. This film, while playful,  respects cultures and humanity and shows a view of the human condition which is seldom seen.
0525953728|5.0|Great accounting from a person that was there.  Good Bless our country and our soliders that have the courage to stand up for their beliefs.  Most will never be the same.  Some will not be able to survive in our country in a social re-entry.  They will be locked up and have a frozen picture of the necessary evil.  Thank you for sharing with us how this evil man was taken down.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game so much it is awesome It has great view<br />would u like or love this game cause I do
B007RRFUHM|5.0|After seeing a few of her live performances on Youtube I knew I had to have her CD. It's become one of my favorites. There's something different and jazzy about her voice that I love. Some of the more pop songs, like \\"Cameo Lover\\" took me a few listens to like, but there's a moment in every song that will make you want to back up and listen again.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Great app I have it on my phone, kindle fire, ipod, and lapop for easy notetaking and writing down memos anywhere I am. I'm an avid writer and often have inspiration for new story ideas dawn on me, lets say, on the bus. Instead of having to fish out a writing pad I'm able to just jot down the idea on my phone on evernote and when I get home I can develop the idea on my laptop. Very easy to use I give it two thumbs up!
0525953728|5.0|Powerful stuff!  Told in matter-of-fact fashion by a man who LOVES his job!!!  What he & his fellow SEALS did, they did dozens of times before yet with the added pressure of a \\"big name\\" target----NO PROBLEM-----MISSION ACCOMPLISHED!  3 cheers to this SEAL & all his colleagues!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I really like this game it is a lot of fun and I play it all the time. I think you should do the same.
0525953728|5.0|I just can't put this book down!  Very down to earth and an easy read.  Hilarious at times also and very honest and sincere.
B009B50QOU|5.0|Just one of the must amazing albums from Green day! can't wait to the other ones to come out, Dos! and Tre!
B00633W614|4.0|Enjoyable book to read.  Love the History and the characters.  I am waiting for the third book of the series.

0783240236|5.0|Great movie, have watched it several times and would recommend it to anyone, One of Hitchcock's Best Thrillers 5 STARS
B0027MJU00|4.0|I read \\"Gone Girl\\" and decided to continue with this author.  \\"Dark Places\\" is a very good book in character development.  The Heroine is very believable, especially if you have had a traumatic experience in your life like she has had.  The other characters were described and participated so well in the story that I had no problem visualizing them and setting myself in the story line.
0307719774|5.0|I've had several attempts in owning a journal before where I can write down my daily thoughts.  Sadly, all of those, failed -- never had enough thoughts to write down, haha!)<br /><br />I think this is perfect as I won't be forced to complete a whole page with my daily thoughts -- as I only have a few lines to put in my thoughts for the day.  What's more, there are daily questions which helps me on what to reflect and write about per day.<br /><br />I also love how the book looks like.  It gives the 'vintage-y journal' feel.  The front and back covers look like recycled paper and I also love the gold edges on the pages.<br /><br />I really hope I get to complete this for 5 years as I'm so sure it would be fun to read back on what my thoughts were years back.<br /><br />This is a great idea and I think it will make a great gift as well.  I'm buying a few more copies to give out to my friends.  I'm sure it's something they'll enjoy.<br /><br />Ps.  I don't recommend this to people who really have a lot of thoughts to write down per day as there are only a few lines provided where you can put in your thoughts. :)
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Very good and very smart and easy to use beautiful amazing qnd wonderful very    user friendly and has all the words in it
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a great book! with awsome cliff hangers! alot of people that i know have read this book and lokedbit!
B006ZCWTXS|5.0|Rebecca Ferguson's CD was a pleasant surprise. I really enjoyed the whole CD! I'm looking forward to her next album.
030758836X|5.0|This book gives new meaning to \\"can't put it down.\\"  With characters you love to hate, the plot twists and turns are amazing.  Yes, the central characters--one in particular--are sick people (both protagonists and antagonists in one) and no, you won't relate to them (if you do, perhaps you should be committed), but everything still feels, well, real, somehow.  The ending has gotten some negatives from readers, but I liked it.  The breathtaking finale was masterfully conceived and written, and not the cliche TV movie ending that some readers might prefer.  Go read it and know you are in the hands of an author who knows how to tell a story and creep you out at the same time.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Love the book!!!!! it caught me from the beginning till the end! couldn't stop reading it! I wish there was more to read about!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Love the game puts a spin on a classic arcade game find puzzle pieces to unlock more puzzles and get prizes to earn more power ups
B009GEGW62|4.0|Dish Network was fighting with local CBS affiliate for a couple weeks so I had to catch up online. Next time something like that happens to you call and threaten to switch providers. Got about $100 in credits and my station back. Deal! So, this HIMYM episode. Pretty good. Almost sounds like they've toned down the laugh track a little this season in response to the near-universal over the top complaints. Fun note: went to high school with series co-creator Carter Bays. We were both in the band and went on a trip to Germany where I snapped a pic of him asleep (hungover) on a bus with a banana, a tounge depressor and some other items in his mouth. Ah... Good times.
B002NHGG92|5.0|I'm not much of a TV person until my best friend talked me into watching The Vamp Diaries! I watched all 3 seasons in a week and am not SO excited for season 4!!
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|Love this movie, glad that kids are paying attention to the culture and to what extremes it may go.  Washington is already the richest district in the US! Not much of a leap to media personalities and lifestyle portrayed in this story.
B0099G3I96|4.0|I have been a No Doubt fan for a long long time.  This album is wonderful, but the overall tempo is slower than the older stuff.  There are a few tracks that play with the old style, but the new slower sound has its own wonderfulness.  A good listen.
B007MDB71O|5.0|My wife and me love this movie.<br />After we saw it at the cinema we had to have the blue ray, and we did.<br /><br />Whit this movie you'll have a great time and lot's of fun.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is an extremely fun and very addicting game. Both my adult daughter and all 3 of her children absolutely love it, as well as I. Well worth it! I give it a full 5 stars and highly recommend this app
B005OK722U|3.0|Hostel III is not as good as Hostel II, which was not as good as the original Hostel. Knowing this was a direct-to-DVD sequel, and having read reviews beforehand, my expectations were not very high. I wanted a decent story with adequate acting and special effects that weren't terribly cheap-looking. It met these qualifications, and I enjoyed it enough to give it three stars.<br /><br />The film takes quite a while to get going - more than 30 minutes - after a series of fake-outs and false starts. That wasn't a bad thing, and I was genuinely surprised a couple of times. The plot is more than a little influenced by \\"The Hangover,\\" with a dose of \\"Taken.\\" The gore is minimal, likely due to the cheap budget, and there are no real scares. There was one twist that worked OK, but the final twist was very predictable.<br /><br />Hostel III is currently available for streaming on Netflix. I'd recommend watching it there rather than purchasing the DVD.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|I received what I needed as a new author and self publisher.  The material was informative, useful, and foundational for my new business.<br />Thank you Jiohn.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|This is a great movie that has lots of good music and a good moral behind the story. Both my daughters love it!
B002QCD2QO|2.0|As a pagan, I found this film interesting.  It was maybe 40% accurate about actual pagan beliefs.  The rest was just, well, bushwa.  Not all that suspenseful, although Edward Woodward as the Christ obsessed cop was an intriguing character.  Toward the end, I kept thinking they should have made his character a priest.  Probably not one I will watch again.
0345803485|1.0|If you've ever been in an abusive relationship, Gray's need for absolute control will bring back VERY bad memories.  Controlling behaviors are often the first sign of abuse!<br /><br />Furthermore.....This is the most disturbing book I've ever read - and I'm not talking about the S&M but instead the psychological aspects of this story.  Not only is the book VERY poorly written, it makes me sick to think that modern day women would find this story attractive and/or sexy!  What real, well-ballanced, mature woman would find his \\"terms and conditions\\" appealing and not run the other direction immediately!?  Nothing about his initial behavior indicates he is capable of a healthy relationship...and don't we teach our daughters to run from this type of controlling man?  I'm sorry - but I find her \\"need\\" for him and his good looks, plus her inablity to totally assert her self quite repulsive.  I hope to God my daughters are/will be able to recognize when to run from a man that has to be taught how to be truly, lovingly intimate.  There are books out there that teach women the signs to look for when a man is really into you.  Read that - not this crap.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is amazing!!! I could not put it down. From the very beginning the author draws you into a world that is so exciting you don‘t want to stop turning the pages.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|this game is enjoyable.  It is challenging enough to be interesting but easy enough that you are not frustrated to a point of not wanting to play
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I really enjoyed this book and couldn't put it down!  It was written very well and kept me very interested.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I give a 5 for the films, but I don't want to buy this set for two reasons:<br />1. I only want the trilogy and<br />2. The packaging isn't good(I like actual snap cases)<br /><br />Does anyone know if there is such a set on Amazon? Either the trilogy, or all 4 I guess, with actual cases?
B005EGXTEE|4.0|Excellent trilogy.  Original plot.  Definitely worth reading for the realistic effect war and conflict has on people and its long term effects mentally.
1423140605|5.0|my grandaughter could not wait to get this book. We pre ordered it as all of his books are excellent. This one again, did not let her down. She loves it along with her other friends. Nice job Rick, hope others are in the works.

1455502758|4.0|Christopher Hitchens, the British American contrarian whose columns  for Vanity Fair describing  his  \\"Year of Living Dyingly\\" (of esophageal cancer),which are  collected in this striking memoir,  kept on keeping on as long as he could. He went for broke, electing an  experimental course of proton  treatment at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston when standard treatments were unavailing.  Throughout, he kept his readers abreast of his progress, or, rather, the progress of the disease: \\"every passing day represents more and more relentlessly subtracted from less and less.\\"<br /><br /> Much of the book's appeal lies in the author's  honesty, in his unflinching willingness to assess and address what was happening to him without ever asking us to feel sorry for him (but who could help it). Of his pain he writes \\"[i]t's probably a merciful thing that pain  is impossible to describe from memory. It's also impossible to warn against.\\" He struggles with the problem  of those who would commiserate with him if only they could find the right words. \\"Friends and relatives . . . don't really  have the option of not making kind inquiries,\\" but h finds them hard to deal with no matter how well-intentioned or thoughtful. As he put it, \\"there was the unreasonable urge to have a kind of monopoly on, or a sort of veto over, what was actually sayable\\".<br /><br />Hitchens  is not the first author to send us regular reports from \\"tumortown\\" after learning of the \\"nasty double cross\\" that would cut short his life.  In fact, Hitchens  had read and admired the weekly columns by the British journalist John Diamond in the late 1990's  as he described his year-long siege by cancer. \\"Rightly he admitted cowardice and panic along side curiosity and occasional courage,\\" Hitchens writes. But in the end, \\"Diamond had to die; and he duly, correctly (in narrative terms) did.\\" Just as Hitchens would and did.<br /><br />Hitchens was in all things quite remarkable. To shed light on our country's controversial practice of waterboarding, Hitchens, on assignment for Vanity Fair magazine,  voluntarily submitted  to the practice. His accounts of the experience  helped convince the Obama administration to outlaw the practice in January, 2009.  Such was the man. Much admired, he is much  missed and will be for years to come.<br /><br />End note. Hitchens  records that he discussed John Diamond with Julian Barnes. One wishes he had gone into detail. Barnes  translated and edited into book form \\"In The Land of Pain  Alphonse Daudet\\" (Knopf, 2002), the 19th Century French author's notes on his eleven-year struggle with  the excruciating pain caused by tabes dorslis (literally wasting of the back, a form of neurosyphilis,  and the equally painful treatments he underwent to help him cope with it.  It seems probable that Barnes may have given Hitchens a copy of \\"Pain\\" and discussed it with him. Whether or not that happened, reading \\"Pain\\" in conjunction with \\"Mortality\\" helps round out the picture of what these men went through.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|Ken Follette is one of my favorite authors.  I've read everything he has written.  I was very excited when I heard he was writing a series on the 20th century and wasn't thrilled with Fall of Giants his first volume but now comes his second \\"Winter of the World\\" and it is a winner.  A page turner from the beginning.  A great read through the rise of Hitler with wonderfully drawn characters and exciting events.  A great look through history for young adults and people of all sexes and ages.  It's a great love story, a great adventure story and a revue of history through those horrible days of World War Two.  It's big, it's colorful, its rewarding.  Did I say it was GREAT?  Buy it, you won't regret the investment.
B009B50QOU|4.0|I was 12 years old when I heard Dookie and was instantly a Green Day fan. I even loved the changing of styles over the years. After saying that I have to admit I am somewhat disappointed in this album. While it isn't bad it just doesn't have even one song that I would say is great. I understand this is really only one part so I am just hoping the next two will have some more to offer. GREEN DAY FOREVER!!!!
0307341577|3.0|3 1/2 stars if that choice was available.  Dark Places is compelling enough to recommend.  I enjoy the macabre writing style of Flynn. It's horror, mystery, thriller and family dynamics (dysfunctional to the extreme) all mixed together.  Is Dark Places completely plausible - no, but this is fiction and I think it is meant to frighten.  In Dark Places, as in Sharp Objects Flynn's method of narrating is captivating and she has an uncanny ability to portray dark family dysfunction like no other. I liked Sharp Objects better than Dark Places and I am currently reading Gone Girl, so I enjoy this author and will continue to read her novels.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Great story that just won't let you put the book down. Shows how amazing some people can be, makes you wish you could have been honored to meet such a person.<br /> Amazing people our military are!!!!

0316227706|5.0|Most coffee table books get looked at occasionally and put away.  I keep looking at this one over and over.....and the images make me grin each and every time!  Joy just seems to jump off the pages.  I have already ordered calendars for Christmas gifts and more orders will be placed.  I want everyone I know who loves dogs to share in the happiness this book gives.

B003L77G38|5.0|Which means you already know what I think of this simply amazing, too good for TV scripted show that NOBODY is watching, hence I get, I think 11 more episodes until my heart is once again broken as I salute the end of another absolutely outstanding television show. I am with both reviewers of TV Guide and USAToday who have tirelessly and shamelessly promoted this show (who both often will try to push a Friday night show opposite it, ie: \\"you can watch so and so for some slightly decent entertainment, or you can crawl out of your it's the end of the week and I'm tired and don't want my brain to work too hard malaise and watch Fringe for truly intelligent, well-acted, excellent entertainment\\" (sic). I do have to say that putting Grimm up against Fringe is simply Hollywood being rude again as if there is a real choice. I mean, Fringe has been on a lot longer, but has continued to get better and better for the three of us watching it. Grimm is pretty much on a par with Fringe, in creativity and intelligence and lovely quirky characters (seriously, Walter or Monroe? As if we have a choice!), but I think I'm just being bitter again.<br /><br />Admittedly, Fringe had a bit of a stuttering beginning, but I don't believe I've ever seen a sci fi show that didn't (I'll reference Eureka here, which in my opinion had about the worst first year of any sci fi show I've seen - fast forward to its final show that I used up a box of Kleenex as my heart broke watching what became, to me, as close to the perfection of Firefly we have gotten on the entertainment medium called scripted television). Fringe, for those of you who abandoned it for whatever reasons, thus making me soon face another evening wrapped in my favorite blankie, box of Kleenex on hand as I once again, pay homage to the finale of sci fi perfection, will forever be burned into my memory with its wonderful cast of characters - Olivia, Peter, Astrid, and the ultimate arguably best character since Capt. Malcolm Reynolds of Firefly, Walter, presumably *SPOILER ALERT* defeat the Observers as they seek to strip earth of whatever they need and move on to do the same to another hapless planet. And honestly? How did they find the perfect actress to play Etta - who is the spitting image of Olivia with Peter's eyes?<br /><br />While I am grateful that we get with Fringe what we have not gotten from countless other wonderful show (she says, bitterly, still wondering just what The Event was even after two or three years).<br /><br />So I should be grateful to Fox who has been far more generous overall than other networks *cough* NBC *cough* for giving us closure (ie:Prison Break). But really, I couldn't say it better than either the TV Guide guy OR the USAToday guy who have shamelessly and bravely stood up for this truly brilliant show (although without ant compensation) - THIS is not Fox's fault. It is our's.<br /><br />After all Fox is a business and has continued to allow the same 3.5 million viewers (paltry in network world) the privilege of this intelligent, exceptional scripted show far longer than the numbers game should have allowed. We all make choices with what little time we have these days - especially in the only demographic that counts which boggles my mind - those 18 - 49ers who are simply too busy raising families, working to pay the bills or attending whatever event or child-centered Friday night delight to watch an original brand new Steven Spielberg offering let alone a simple TV show. No matter that those of us OVER the age of 49 have made our money and probably have more discretionary income to spend on most advertisers wares - but I'm on my weighted soap box again. I think even Fox was hoping that the final season of Fringe would garner more than the usual 3.5 million voters as I read the comments when they announced them. I think even Fox would have liked another year of this wonderfully odd cast and the many stories left to tell about them.<br /><br />But alas, for whatever reasons, we, the People, have spoken and Fringe will soon be no more. Some day, people who could have made a difference now WILL find and watch Fringe and wish they'd watched it when it mattered. So do I.

B0099G7KDQ|5.0|This album is truly incredible. I can listen to the whole thing over and over again. \\"Broken Crown\\" is my favorite song on the album. If you like \\"Dust Bowl Dance\\" off their first album, you'll love it too. Don't hesitate to buy this remarkable album - you won't regret it!

0425263908|3.0|This was the book I chose to read to get over my Fifty Shades withdrawal. The book had rave reviews and promised to be every bit as addictive as the FSOG trilogy however it fell short for me.<br /><br />The story was just too rushed. If there was going to be a sequel to Bared to You, I feel the first book could have revealed more about the characters and their relationship could have built up. This would have allowed the readers to feel a connection with Eva & Gideon instead I got to the end of the book and didn't have a clear picture in my head of who they both were.<br /><br />Overall, Sylvia Day can write! But Bared to You just needed a little more substance to become a stand out story for me.<br /><br />My Rating: 3 stars
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|This was a joy of a read! I suspect it will make a fun movie.  The narrative plays out like an amalgom of Willy Wonka, The Last Starfighter and I Love the '80s.  Any lover of colorful fiction who possesses even the slightest inclination of reverence for geekery in all its forms should gave a blast with this one. I imagine I'll be rereading this before the year is up.
1476715904|2.0|I just don't get it. Everyone seems to love this book but I must be missing something!<br /><br />The book was short and the story felt rushed to me. After one date Layken is in love with her neighbour, Will. No build up, no questions, they are both equally infatuated with each other.<br /><br />Her relationship with new friend Eddie was equally as bizarre. After five minutes they were instant best friends without saying five words to each other.<br /><br />Also, the author seemed to take her fanatical obsession with the band, The Avett Brothers a step too far by including them in every chapter and then as part of the storyline. I understand that music can motivate writing, but I feel her fascination with this band didn't have to feature so heavily in the book.<br /><br />On a positive note I have to give the author props for the use of `slam' poetry, this was quite unique. I had never heard of it before and I think some of the poetry featured was thought-provoking and touching.<br /><br />For people who love Young Adult fiction and want a quick, easy read then this book may be for you. But once I finished the book I had no desire to buy the sequel.<br /><br />My rating: 2.5 stars
B008XG1X18|5.0|addictive...I like that it is not a social updating status, put your life out there kind of app. It's about things you like and find interesting.
1476712042|4.0|This was a great read and I was hooked after a few short chapters. The characters of Abby and Travis were well thought out and I became attached to them almost immediately. The gradual build up in their relationship was agonizing, but in a good way, that made me keep turning the pages in anticipation.<br /><br />The only thing that really bothered me about the book was Travis nicknaming his lover Pigeon. I really didn't understand the endearment but hey, it's different, I will give the author that!<br /><br />My rating: 4 stars
B008Y6QZ56|5.0|it is hard to find a good action movie that has a deep message about the fight in your life and heart:-) my favorite caracter is tommy even though most favor the older brother.and nick nolte did a great job he still has the stuff.
B009ENKLFS|1.0|It was chunky and stunk, I would never pay money for something like this again.it would be great if you made them load faster
B007UPNA6Y|4.0|Jack as you expect. Twist with the female characters this time though that I appreciated. Surprising that Lee Child can still bring something new to his story arc.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The plot was intricate enough to keep me interested, the characters were fully formed and believable, and likable. I cared what happened to them. This was a real page-turner.
B0049VQZUA|5.0|For anyone who loves horror, this is a great watch. I'd recommend the series to anyone who is into Zombies or \\"walkers\\" as they are called, in this series.  The acting is great and the special effects are just awesome.  I purchased Season 1 and we watched the entire series in one seating.  We started Season 2 and it was just as great.  I am so looking forward for Season 3 and hope that there is enough storyline for it to continue a few more Seasons.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|I am in love with Mumford & Sons! Their music touches me in a way that no other music band could. This album is definitely worth the buy! The songs are all so touching and soothing. Some are slow and contemplative while others are passionate and joyful. It has just the right amount of bittersweet melodies and uplifting tunes! This album is just as good as their first album. Definitely recommend it for any new lover of Mumford & Sons or a die hard Mumford & Sons fan! Either way, I do not think it will disappoint.
B006T4NQNO|2.0|This ring is lightweight poly or plastic of some kind and you have to be really careful when trying to thread a filter on it. I don't believe it is durable and am looking for a backup in case this one breaks. Would'nt take muck impact IMHO.
B005LAIHY0|4.0|This movie made me feel very nervous and freak me out so bad I couldn't sleep all night. I keep worrying about some aliens from distance universe is planning to destroy mankind.  This movie is very deep and NOT for young people,<br /><br />This movie is very disturbing.
B008RYN44U|1.0|I'm not going to pretend I'm a huge fan of No Doubt, but they played a pivotal role in my childhood. Tragic Kingdom is an album I remember being played throughout the house constantly as a kid. Spiderwebs, Don't Speak, Just a Girl. All three are fantastic song and I'll admit I remember liking Return of Saturn, if not as much. Then Rock Steady was seriously forgettable. Detective and Hella Good were the two songs I can remember.<br /><br />And so here I am, 11 years later, listening to No Doubt's newest. A little over halfway into the first track, I'm asking myself if I'm still listening to the same song. Ironically enough, it's called \\"Settle Down\\". What a crap. Is too long and just seems to ramble a lot. Sadly, it goes downhill from here.<br /><br />The only tracks I like are Looking Hot and the eponymous track. Both are not pop pap, well, they're quite pop, but they wouldn't be out of place on Return of Saturn. Looking Hot in particular has a catchy beat and ear worm chorus that will sure serve as a good concert singalong, but even then, I don't consider it to be anything special. One song, if I remember correctly, begins with a nice electric guitar riff... then suddenly this is blackballed by a thumping techno beat and synths, YUCK. Easy has absolutely pathetic lyrics and it sounds like they're whispering \\"I'm Madonna, I'm Madonna, I'm Madonna\\" in the background. It's quite creepy.<br /><br />Then in the second half of the album, we get six slow and boring ballads in a row... REALLY Gwen? What happened to the commentary of tracks like Just in a Girl, Trapped in a Box? Or the lyrical cleverness of Don't Speak?<br /><br />Maybe if this album came out about 3 or maybe 4 years after \\"Rock Steady\\", I'd be a tad bit more forgiving. But for this to be the band's first album in 11 years is really just inexcusable, and pathetic even. Avoid.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|This app freezes up my kindle whenever it comes on! I have no idea what this game even is because it won't go any further then the opening screen.
1594744769|4.0|I had been wanting to read this book for a while.  The photos disturbed me in a good way.<br /><br />I felt that the first part of the book was great.  The development of the story was good and the suspense left you hooked and wanting to continue turning the pages.<br /><br />However, as the story progressed and I came to the final chapter, I felt like Ransom glossed over the development of the story and rushed to the final ending, leaving me wanting to know more.<br /><br />I think a sequal would be good for this story.<br /><br />I rate this highly for the photos.  They totally made the book.  I wish more books would be interactive like that.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I remember this game from K, it is very child friendly,  although I did have to buy it for myself. So I would recommend it for others. :-)
B0086700CM|5.0|Best game ever! Everyone in my house loves the game. The game is hard to put down. My mom and dad feel in love with it too.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|All I can say that this movie is inspiring and shows despite any differences family will always be family!!!This is a must watch for everyone. Highly recommended.
B00846REIS|4.0|Having read 50 Shades of Gray, which I enjoyed but found somehow lacking. I was looking for more character development and variety of love scenes and interaction between the lead characters.<br /><br />I found this in Bared to You. The characters were more vivid. Eva was an adult with her own feeling and goals making the exchanges between Eva and Gideon more exciting and believable. The wide circle of friends and family included in the story line made you understand the motivations and actions of Eva and Gideon and their reactions to each other. I felt drawn into their world and eager to see where the next page would take me. I read the first book in 2 days and the second in 4 days and I'm sure I will devour the third installment with equal enthusiasm.<br /><br />To sum up I found Bared to you an exciting and satisfying read which kept your interest from cover to cover. I would highly recommend it.

0393338827|5.0|Michael Lewis' book is a laugh out loud expose of Wall street and its incredible greed. Not only is it hilarious but also very informative about how the subprime mortgage business turned into a wall street money machine and ultimatly crashed leaving the US taxpayer and many people and businesses around the world holding the bag.  Of course wall street walked away without so much as a slap on the wrist and billions in profits.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is an absolutely fabulous website, the recipies are off the chain, you find so many different ideas, and simple recipies. I was so caught up on that I haven't had time to explore all the other things on the the website. This is truly a good app to have and a very good website to look for something different and good!!
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I was very disappointed in this series, yet I had to read the whole dang set to see if it got any better. Unfortunately it didn't and it was very predictable and very BLAH. The writer used the same phrases and word choices over and over. It was a light read and I still don't see what the hype was about. I'm very disappointed there wasn't any depth; I feel bad for all of the women in our world who thought this was a masterpiece and really were excited and watched television interviews regarding the book. We need to expand our literary horizons and not settle for such low level smutty nonsense. I am embarrassed of myself for reading them but they kept me busy for a few moments.
B0027SSV90|5.0|In credible book. Hold on and wait to be shocked! You don't have to be a fan of there music to appreciate the book and stories. I just hope they do the book justice with the movie.
1449410243|5.0|It's nice reading the Oatmeal's works on these glossy high quality pages.  The pull out poster is much larger than I expected too.<br /><br />If you don't know if you'd like this or not, spend a few minutes of the Oatmeal's page, if you enjoy his comic on there you're basically getting more of the same with this book.
0307346617|5.0|I'll start this off by saying that I'm not usually a fan of the zombie apocalypse genre. It's a genre that seems to me to be far too easy to play out and tell the same story over and over.<br /><br />That said, World War Z was a pleasent surprise. Max Brooks takes the worn out idea of a zombie apocalypse and breaths new life into it with this book. He not only explores the idea of a zombie apocalypse itself but looks into some of the further reaching consequences of such an event. This book will make you think, make you laugh, and in a few places perhaps even make you cry. I highly recommend it even if zombies aren't normally a part of your reading list.

B005CRQ3LG|5.0|I am sure this is a wonderful book and I looked forward to reading it to my grand daughter.  When I got no confirming order e-mail and it didn't appear on my Kindle I checked my account data and found that the sale had been completed.  Here is where the story gets unfortunate.  The book is not compatible with my Kindle touch, but the Amazon cust. serv. person wasn't aware or didn't put two and two together so impatiently ran me through sync exercises and repeatedly rebooting, and checking each page of my contents.  He was frustrated when it took me some time to perform these tasks and he grew impatient.  I've never have previously had a bad Amazon representative experience, quite the opposite..  It was disillusioning, even a poor operation does better than this.  At any rate, I'll go to Barnes and get the book.  If you have a K Touch, this book is unavailable.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I enjoyed this installment very much it continued in the same intense and captivating manner I found in the prior book,a very good read
B00846REIS|5.0|Ok after reading 50 shades of Grey I didn't think that I would ever find another book I liked as well. But this was a very close run for the money.<br />Couldn't wait for book 2 in fact I read book 2 in one day:)<br />would highly recommend. Waiting for release of book 3......Awesome!!!!!!!!
B0015DROBO|5.0|Amazing visual descriptions and character development. This book bounces back and forth from lunacy to being  so sane that you wonder if someone has tricked you. Never have i felt so lost and grounded at the same time... A MUST READ
0307730697|5.0|Not just another Navy Seal book.  This man hit both lows and highs that are beyond imagination.  The fact that he hit both is so unique, he is most deserving of a book.  Great book!!

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|fun game. well done. like how I can play without paying for more coins. good gameplay good graphics nice sounds. addictive and hard to put down
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Okay so i just want to say that i have read all of John's books collaborations and all and i have to say this is his weakest book. I felt like i was reading a book by an author who was attempting to depress me out of my mind with a purpose. Unlike looking for alaska where i had a good reason to be depressed, TFioS was depressing from beginning to end purely because of the subject matter. I love Johns other books but this one did not feel like he wrote it, something was missing and i'm not sure what it is.
B004SEVPWQ|1.0|Full Internet access??? I was NOT playing with the app, but I got a Force Close prompt for \\"com.kb.carrom3DFULL\\" which seems to be related to this app, according to Goggle search.  Runs all the time?  I don't need it.  UNINSTALLED!!
B008G8SFGO|2.0|I'll admit, my days of enjoying Kiss died when the grunge era started. I've always kept up on what the band is up to and if they release new music, I'll give it a fair shake. The most recent lineup may be the strongest lineup the band has seen since the original, however my enthusiasm is long gone. I just don't find this style of music intriguing anymore. Lyrically Kiss has never been very good, but the energy that was put into the music made it worth listening to. That energy just doesn't seem to be there anymore and songs seem to be a group going through the motions in order to put out some new material. It's been this way since Psycho Circus or at least that is when it became most noticable. It seems to me that Gene/Paul are simply trying to live in the past these days instead of being true to themselves. I mean having Thayer/Singer in Frehley/Criss makeup is bad, but having Thayer write wannabe Frehley tracks and even to sing the song like Ace is an insult to every Kiss fan out there. There will never be a Kiss as great as the Kiss that ruled the mid to late 70's. I wish Paul/Gene would just let it die and go out some at least some dignity in tact.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|Really loved this movie and so did my little boy -- he's become a huge John Carter fan now! Had to buy some old toys that came out years ago for him to play with.<br /><br />Excellent production values, nice special effects, a beautiful leading lady and a dashing star -- an emotional adventure that I'm sure my little boy and I will relive again and again.
B0087HT36U|3.0|It could be worse, It could be raining.<br />I don't like having to review it before playing the last level.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|You have to love this guy.  What a success story to self-publish with this kind of success.  It is a great science fiction novel.  Although not answering or addressing the deep questions of mankind, it was an enjoyable read and a good value for the money.  Don't ask too many \\"why\\" questions (like -- why couldn't they figure out how to build an elevator; why didn't someone go apeshit and go outside?) and you will have a satisfying read.  I think it will make a stunning movie
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Oh my Fifty my poor Fifty.. I know It is really embarrassing to admit it, but I read the first book 4 times, the second book 4 times, and the 3rd book 3 times. Until I finally told myself \\"time to get a life & give other books a chance\\"! Well got so disappointed with some other books I downloaded. Nothing seems to satisfy me after Fifty Shades Trilogy. So I even demanded my husband to give me Fifty Shades of Grey Trilogy in German as a Gift on Christmas (yes! A demanding request although it will take two months for me to have that!) Since it would be helpful for me to practice my German. So after a month of disappointment from the books i downloaded after Fifty. I finally got over with it & I found couple of books that i can recommend to the Fans of Fifty.  I think On Dublin Street is a good read too.  Definitely worth reading. I highly recommend the Trilogy.. Guys it's worth the money!
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Jack Reacher is a wonderful character and I truly enjoy Lee Child's Reacher series.  This one meets the mark.  Reacher is involved in a plot with international and local twists.  The characters he meets hitchhiking in this one are truly woven together.  Great read.
B003V6L94Q|5.0|Cd arrived in prfect condition. Lots of hits on the album and some other lesser known songs that are pretty good as well.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I loved the CD. I have been singing the songs all day ever since I received it. Not all of the songs were familiar, but I have grown to like them.
B0007TKNII|5.0|Product arrived promptly and in perfect condition. My girlfriend and watched it right away and it is amazing on surround sound.Great dvd great value.
B008V0OLOW|5.0|I'm hoping to get these reviews up where they should be.  This is a fantastic album. Dance on your kitchen floor.  Play along and sing.  There are no mistakes here. Bluesy, jazz, swing.  The songs Diana Krall grew up on.  This is not canned music, top 40, or the American Songbook. Each piece here takes you on new paths with innovative and surprise arrangements and strings.  I say Grammy. I'm lovin' it.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|I love this CD. I have played it so much, that the songs keep playing in my head. There is not one song that I didn't like.
B008966SIU|5.0|I really liked Veckatimest because it had good energy and was well crafted. However, Shields takes their music to another level.  It's like listening to a dream and takes the listener to a place that is a little outside of reality.  I was lucky enough to see Grizzly Bear on the night of the album release and had never heard the album although it was leaked.  Hearing the songs live before I heard the album was amazing and is something that I can say is a rarity.  That experience made me buy the album immediately.  Overall, one of the best albums of the year!
B008G8SFGO|5.0|KISS Monster CD is Freak\\"y\\" and Outta this world. They don't miss a beat. Another outstanding CD from the greatest band in the world, (Who needs the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame). Excellent lyrics, vocals and music. Well worth the wait. Believe me you won't be disappointed. You wanted the best, you got the best \\"Monster\\".
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book. Realy good story. Lots of people would like it. One of the best books i have read. Get it
B00846REIS|4.0|At first I thought it was just an ordinary story, but then, read on.. The thrill is there. You would even want to go on till you get sad the story would end
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Seriously, buy it.  You will love it, and you will thank me later.  Best album of 2012.  Kinda sorta reminds me of DMB prior to Crash, in a good way.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book will really captivate your heart. Absolutely five stars! Exciting turn of events. You wouldn't want the story to end. Can't wait for the third bookto come out!
B00004YRQA|5.0|Works perfect and compatable with the Sony PS2 as stated. Great packaging. And now I'm able to save my games worry free. Sony approved!
B00000JGHS|4.0|This movie is actually pretty funny. Its acting makes it hard to take it serious even at parts that in any other movie would be serious points. In this film Demi Moore plays Erin Grant a recently divorced mother who is unemployed from her desk job with the FBI. In a unfair custody ruling her criminal ex-husband gets custody of their daughter. In order to pay for the appeal Erin starts working at The Eager Beaver which is a strip club. Her problems proceed to get worse as a crooked politician falls head over heels for her and begins to romantically pursue her. As Erin finds herself wondering deeper and deeper into troubled waters she must make risky decisions to protect herself, her daughter, and their future together.<br /><br />Striptease is a good movie, its not real high quality acting but i tend to believe that is intentional due to it is the only time i have ever seen some of the actors give such a 'unique' performance. It has plenty of funny moments and one liners where you get a decent laugh. It won't make you laugh until you cry but they will be decent laughs. This is a good popcorn movie that is enjoyable to watch. Its not going to gross you out, its not going to scare you, or keep you on the edge of your seat in suspense. The plot is fairly predictable and easy to guess what will happen next. It will however offer decent entertainment to those who are willing to lower their nose and give it a chance.<br /><br />The nudity in my opinion deserves its own paragraph. If your planning on buying this for the nudity then be warned you may be slightly disappointed while there is a good amount of it i wouldn't consider much of it extremely good. If your a Demi fan then you will love it because this is the only film i know of that she bares as much as she does in this film. There is plenty of nudity but i agree with the review written by The Hawk that the casting department did a good job making Demi one of the better looking girls in the movie.<br /><br />I also agree with The Hawk on the statement that this movie does attempt to change some social stereotypes that plague strippers and related professions. Being someone who knows two strippers and also knowing a few women in the adult film industry i was happy to see a movie that tries to show that strippers are people and are just as human as anyone else. Many people forget that about strippers and in related fields (adult film industry) that the women in those occupations are still people who feel all the same emotions that the rest of us feel. It was nice to see a film that tries to show that they are not evil people but are just people.<br /><br />This film is really funny and is fun to watch. It is not a movie to that will leave much of a long lasting impression on you. Meaning you it won't really change how you look at life. Other than what i mentioned above, it might make you realize strippers and women in related professions are not evil people. This is not a twisting thriller or a complex puzzle like Courage Under Fire it is just something that will entertain you with quirky acting, funny lines, and decent nudity.<br /><br />To sum it up Striptease is a pretty good movie for the value. I give it 4/5 stars it is pretty good and a fun popcorn movie that is fun to watch over and over.
B005K17RU0|5.0|this app has never failed me! I absolutely love how you can view the forecast right when it shows up!
B002OLV3CW|5.0|A Day to Remember has been one of my favorite bands of all time since I first heard All I Want.  Getting this album was an amazing day and now after having listened to it 65+ times I can safely say it is one of my favorite albums of all time!  A must get for any fans of the genre!  The music is amazing and the bonus DVD detailing tour and recording life is hilarious.  Plus I got it in perfect condition in a timely manner but that's Amazon for you.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|Would not have thought that controls so simple could be used in such a fun game. This game is worth paying for, but its free! So what are you waiting for?
B007GCY8FS|3.0|Not one of his best - the story line was at best acceptable, but it lacked the passed story lines that make this character pop.
B009FOBZL0|5.0|Have listened to the album 4 times now.<br />I can really say it grows on me everytime.<br />Jakob shows us a more mature version of his music, a few tracks take a bit from each of his previous albums, with a few very energetic tracks.<br />All very easy to listen to.<br />Nice job.
B00479SVBU|4.0|Having used the Satechi SD for several years now after the CD deck in my wife's Volvo went out (not an easy fix in Volvo's), I went ahead and ordered one of these looking for a better user interface. Not only have they managed to make a display that while small, one can still see the display well. In addition, they fixed the oddities of the old unit that made it so you had to label the folder a certain way for it to recognize it. It will read up to 32g media directly, 5 x 99 folder levels, and has external 1/8\\" input and outputs. Displays both the folder and file names on the screen.<br />If this one lasts as well as the last one things are looking up!<br />Never mind all those $9.99 units out there, this one is well worth the reasonable cost.<br />I would have given it 5 stars if there was an EQ function in the package, but still does a very good job on the transmission to the radio.
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Lana Del Rey's soulful, alternative hiphop/pop and bluesey sensual voice makes this album a unique and pleasurable experience. Every song is strikingly different from the last and each feels like an experiment gone incredibly right. I rarely enjoy ALL songs on an album but this one really blew me away... Hence the 5 stars! They say her style combines Gangster with Nancy Sinatra and her playful album showcases this nicely. I couldn't imagine those two concepts mixing so incredibly well.<br /><br />I've had this album on the top of my iPod playlist rotation for 2 weeks now. Can't get enough!
B007TKT2SK|5.0|What can I tell you? I love this fraction calculator. It's the best I ever had on all my devices.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was captivated by the story and the characters and the sense of past and present. But at the midway point I had to regroup and in the end the book left me with a bad feeling - sad and dark. Should you read it? Yes. Will you love it? I just don't know.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I down loaded this game for my 4yr old but I ended up playing more than my child. Its a little confusing to understand the prize's and what the different coins/tokens mean. Once you REALLY get into it....YOU RUN OUT OF COINS!!! lol But its a relaxing way to kill time.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have learned so much,  and found so many great recipes on this site/app!  it's great!  No problems really,  other than the occasional force close.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|It was aight. Book was given too much hype. The dominatrix/submissive relationship was too much for me. I felt sorry for Ana getting caught up in Grey's sick ways
B005LAIHY0|2.0|Wow, this didn't even seem like a Ridley Scott film.<br /><br />For a laundry list of what's wrong here, you can read the other in-depth reviews, but the image of  a couple of the main characters trying to outrun the path of a rolling spacecraft instead of dodging  off to either side pretty much sums it up. The most ineptly manned trillion dollar mission ever.<br /><br />This film also underscores just how important a good soundtrack is.  Go back and listen to how effective the soundtrack to the original \\"Alien\\" film is in supporting the awe, suspense and horror of the visuals.  The soundtrack for \\"Prometheus\\" just doesn't cut it.<br /><br />Though I will watch this movie again for the sets and cinematography, it's too bad \\"Prometheus\\" has more in common with \\"Alien Resurrection\\" than Ridley's original classic.
B001CDWFPC|5.0|This is certainly one of the best study Bibles I have ever seen.<br />It is generally conservative/evangelical without being particularly oriented towards one view (such as Reformed or Charismatic)<br />The graphical support is as good as the notes and commentary and on top of all that, the readability is first rate, being<br />single-column paragraphed and reader Bible like, even with all that other material on the pages.  Great job.
B008FC4WA4|1.0|That was one of the worst books I've ever read.  It basically ends right in the middle of the book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I freakin' love this app. Me and my mum play it all the time she plays it on her iPod, me my kindle fire. absolutely stunning graphics. looks so real! I love this app so much. good time waster. perfect to pass time in the car on trips... love it;)
B004T4KQJS|4.0|Very interesting book. It would be helpful to the reader if they went to YouTube and entered the books title and watch the video.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Has all the information. I want.  the layout is great and easy to go from info to details.  I would highly recommend
B008G8SFGO|4.0|It's revenge meets rock n roll over. Tommy Thayer kicks ass, a lot of respect earned on this one, alotta cowbell which is great. Heavy but is still really catchy. Really original when it comes to flow and classic 70's kiss when you listen to the lyrics.. (take me down below) = lol. Tommys song is fun to listen to, eric's really reminds you of peters material, somewhat. Eat your heart out = youll groove for sure. Long way down, catchy, all songs are good. No radio hits or headliners but all songs groove. All of the songs will get stuck in your head if you like rnr. I like sonic boom more, in terms of new lineup, but this one is very close, a nose length. Nothin tops creatures lp tho, this cd is KISS circa 1982/1983
B00881VLCE|3.0|I would give this app a better review but it freezes all the time, sometimes back to back, and forces itself closed. Most of the time when this happens, it doesn't even save your game so you have to start all over - REALLY frustrating! PLEASE FIX!!
B009B50QOU|2.0|This is greenday? I own every song they have made. There are more f bombs in this album than all their work combine. I like 2 songs but mostly I'm just disappointed. Hopefully they will bounce. Back with 2 and 3
B004UID2LC|3.0|it may not get the best quality  sound but it is cool. i have not tried to download a video.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|the game is real simple and there's not much to it. its fairly amusing and VERY addicting, providing hours of just dropping coins in certain spots to cause other coins and prides to fall into the ben.
B003RV43X4|5.0|If you like gladiator 300 and Troy your going to love this move. Lots of action a good twist on the original.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|If you like zombie related movies, then this is a must have.<br /><br />If you don't like zombie related movies/shows, then you might still like it.  This is a very well written series.  The character development is well done and the acting is top notch.<br /><br />Battling zombies, while it is part of the show, is more of the side theme.  The show deals more with the interplay of the cast and how they struggle to survive.<br /><br />Season 1 starts in normal time (i.e. pre-zombie).  Then, the main character awakens to find himself alone and trying to determine what has happened.  This is no cheesy Syfy channel movie.  This is a well done series with a strong cast that takes surprising turn after turn.<br /><br />Some questions are answered during this season.  But, many are left and carried over to next year.
B003XVYLDU|4.0|a very original and thought provoking book about the human condition in general and humans in war time in particular. I found it lacking in emotion, but it's an amazing read.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|This is a Christian movie. It speaks about God and his love for us, so if that offends you then this is not the movie for you.<br /><br />I loved Fireproof, and Facing the Giants even more so. So I was looking forward to seeing Courageous. I was not disappointed. This movie was amazing and very well made. It follows the lives of 5 men, 4 cops and their friend Javier. You will laugh (Snake kings!), you will cry, and you will feel God's goodness. This movie was particularly meaningful for me since my father was one of those that was absent.<br /><br />To address what another reviewer said, about the movie bashing men and their poor choices while not speaking about the failings of women: Yes, there are women out there who do bad things to their children. However, the truth is this; few women abandon their children, while many men do. That is why this movie focused on the problem of fatherless children. Just because this movie focuses on men, doesn't mean it's saying that women do no wrong.
B008B8AOQI|5.0|Heard \\"Let Her Go\\" cried and was hooked, had to hear more and was not let down. I am purchasing everything available from this artist. Love his style, voice and the message of every song I have listened to. Wish he was playing ACL Fest in Austin this weekend so I could see him live! Maybe one day!I can't believe I hadn't heard Passenger before now but since I have I am going to spread the word about this talented musician! This is a must have for your music collection, I promise. Check out passengermusicdotcom and give him a listen then come back and buy the cd and write your review to get the name out!
0440237688|5.0|This was an amazing book!  The story is like nothing I've ever read before.  The writing makes you feel like you are literally right there.  I didn't want it to end!  I'm on Amazon right now ordering more books from Lois Lowry.  I don't know how I'd lived this long and never heard of this author before.
B005CWRB44|5.0|This is one of the most valued edc lights on the market today. For the size this is one great light. !
B001JP5JRY|5.0|A Bro Should not write Reviews to another Bro (that´s a chick thing), except if the Second Bro wrote about how to score Chicks or how to support your Bro when scoring chicks. That said, This Book is Legendary!
B005I4JG80|5.0|Love this book! Such a logical approach to baby, I kept thinking \\"that makes so much sense.\\" I wish more American children were being raised this way, there would be a lot less entitled little toddlers running around I think. Fast easy read with loads of humor and relatable moments. Read this!
0525953728|4.0|very good reading, skipping all the training info we have all read before was a good idea and i would recomend it for anyone to get things straight.
B00571F26Y|3.0|The book was an easy read and gave me some information to work with.  I will likely get additional titles on the topic of Wheat sensitivity.
B005LAIHY0|3.0|I got this movie on Demand so I don't know about the quality of the Blue Ray or DVD, so I'm just giving you a review of the movie, don't bother, not because the movie wasn't well done, or it was a bad script, or the special FX were bad, let's face it, it's a Ridley Scott film, you can always trust that, but because it's basically Alien and Aliens with a the name Prometheus. Which is just the name of the ship by the way, a ship that is not shown to be special in any particular way other than it can travel super long distances through space, 3.74 x 10 to the 14th, to be exact, or 37,400 Billion miles, but that doesn't seem particularly special in this world, basically it's just a matter of money. So why they named the movie after the ship I have no idea. The second problem is, nobody does anything, nothing really happens till the very last 5 minutes (which I won't give away). So why put Charlize Theron, Guy Pierce, and Idris Elba, who is great actor, but is so bad a doing an American Texan accent it's ridiculous, distracting and comes out sounding like a bizarre combination of all the caricatures he's heard in the past, Mississippi/Texas/Louisiana, with a bunch of his own British Cockney (aka Michael Cain) thrown in. These are great actors Pierce was nominated for Momentum, and Theron won for Monster, it was as if Scott knew he had a nothing movie and called in a bunch of favors. Anyway, I realize I could go on and on but I won't, just don't buy this movie, rent it, if you feel you absolutely have to see it.
B001QOGYFO|1.0|The movie is a very good movie but the quality of the DVD is very poor we could not get it to play in our DVD player or our computers I would not recommend buying any DVD from this company unless you want to waste your money.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|What prompted me to buy this CD is that I saw the Paul McCartney special on PBS. This is a wonderful collection of old songs and very well performed. I love Paul's style and the collaboration with Diana Krall's jazz piano is great. This CD is well worth it. Even my parents both in their middle to later 80's enjoyed this CD.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Just The movie Alien on graphic steroids. Just The movie Alien on graphic steroids. Just The movie Alien on graphic steroids. Just The movie Alien on graphic steroids.
B004FOA84A|4.0|Loved the game!  Only problem is once it is over, the game is useless. Should allow you to play another series. some of the clues are very hard to figure out!
B00338QENI|4.0|I felt so bad for the Lackes family and really admired the author for digging deep and providing the reader with so much valuable information.  I really learned a lot and enjoyed the story immensely.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|Thank you for the much desired update. It is a great enjoyable game that never gets old! Again, Thank you and have a great day!
1609611543|4.0|Wheat Belly is an interesting, thought provoking read. The books best asset is the fact the authors claims are supported by scientific research. If you want to follow the diet it is very restrictive and I doubt it would be a long term weight loss solution for those wanting to lose weight for good as it is basically based around eliminating a food group. This book is packed with scientific terms which the lay public may find hard to understand if they have not come from a science background - maybe this was the authors ploy - so readers are impressed by his theories without understanding the background behind them? This book is well worth a read but pick and choose what you take away from it.
0767903862|5.0|This book was amazing. His American view on the life and times of what Australia considers a day to day life is informative in so many ways, yet laugh out loud humorous.
1401937268|3.0|When I received this deck I was kind of excited because the reviews for it were postive.  I thought maybe that this might be a good deck for a beginner to learn tarot with.  But after receiving it and going through the cards myself I am disappointed.  I do not find the images of the angels particularly amazing infact I think the faces of many of them are not very attractive.  In a couple of the images it looks like the male figure has make-up on.  This is not a good deck to learn to read intuitively with as much as it would be to use to either memorize the meaning of the cards or simply use the prompting words at the bottom for a reading with no memorization at all.<br /><br />The two things I thought were nice about the deck strangely enough was the word promptings and the book that accompanies it.  I think this would be a nice deck for those doing readings for others as a business and their clients do not appreciate the traditional tarot images or card names. Or for someone dabbling with tarot cards and are put off by traditional names or images.  But for beginners who seriously want to learn tarot I really don't think this deck is that great.  It could be because I have found 2 stellar decks that serve this purpose.  One is sold on Amazon and I have done a review for and the other is not sold here.  I don't think this is a must have for a collection because as I consider using it my mind instead longs for the other deck and for the images that I find on those cards.
B0012TWRAO|4.0|Use this to hold my cell phone to motorcycle.  Works wonderful for that purpose only reason it didn't get five stars is the paint is coming off already.  In fact it was comming off while I was putting it on the bike.  I got this one because it was black but the black is already comming off.  I still like product and I would buy it again i just figure I am going to have to paint it myself.
B002HFP0QU|3.0|I like the concept of dividing the music selections into each Beegee.  Barry's disc is great, Robin -not bad-where the heck Is \\"For whom the bell tolls\\", Maurice-just plain strange.  Have not listeneded to the last disc yet.
B00860YICC|5.0|The Legend of 1900 is a true work of art.  It is a shame that the general American public doesn't seem interested in movies that touch your soul and make you think.
B0053O89YM|5.0|Fascinante! Es una mezcla de drama, comedia, romance muy bien entrelazada.Muestra realidad en que operan los bufetes de abogados y los tribunales, y como sus influencias interactuan para manipular el entorno.
6304711883|5.0|I bought this DVD after seeing the movie a couple of times. Yes, I like it that much.<br /><br />I like the story line. I love how the Gibson character handles the kidnapping of his son. Even though I have seen this movie, I am still caught up in the story when I watch Ransom.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this app is so addictive!!! I can't quit playing it! The only thing that would make it better was if the prides and coins actually came to me!
B0085MNZ66|4.0|I would give this game 5 stars if it had instructions.  Very acceptable permissions.  Great to see developer providing feedback and updates based on customer feedback. I can't seem to figure out how to connect 2 dots of different colors when they are the only dots remaining.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|WOW! That is what sums it up for me. The ending just blew me away.  I  never saw it coming.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|LOVED it.  Can't tell you the last time I watched a movie and immediately watched it again to enjoy the story line and the excellent cast.  Just savor everything this movie offers.
B000V8A95C|5.0|Great! If you saw the play it is worth getting it to remember the awesome time on Broadway in New York City
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Definately buy omnibus (all five books); you won't want to take a break.  They are more like chapters than novels.  I'm looking forward to any more sequels
B003O86FMW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first two books and am now in the middle of Mockingjay.  I just don't want to put these books down.  I downloaded to my Kindle in an instant.<br /><br />June
0525952926|5.0|I had read Fall of the Giants when it was released but decided to go back and read it again before starting Winter of the World.  Boy, am I glad I did!  There was so many things that I had forgotten about some of the characters in the previous book.  Since most are continued  in his new book it has made for a wondefull read.
B007RI56NY|5.0|This album has a different vibe than Trains previous work.  It's more poppy and catchy which isn't always desireable. The lyrics are enjoyable though.  All in all, i like the album.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|as a Kiss fan since the 70's all I can say is this album rocks. best one since carnival of souls.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book kept me guessing all the way through as to who we are actually dealing with. Every time I thought I had a handle on a character, they slipped away, even to the end.
B005Z28M58|5.0|I LOVE 'Desperate Housewives'! I own every season, I have watched and enjoyed every episode! I know that I'm the exception to the rule with regards to my sentiments about the show, but I honestly loved every season of show- I don't feel that 'Desperate Housewives' lost any of its magic in later seasons. Like all good things the show had to come to an end, and I feel that Season 8 was the right time to finish the series, because the show was still great! The final season had it all- mystery, friendships, drama, romance, breakups etc, and HUMOUR!! I thought the Final Episode was generally well executed, except for the final 5 minutes which were unnecessary and disappointing. Marc Cherry, in the final minutes, didn't need to tell the audience that the 4 central characters playing cards together were doing so for the very last time, before going there seperate ways! It just didn't make sense that these women that had been great friends for years and survived extraordinary circumstances together, would in a short space of time leave Wisteria Lane and not stay in touch! Furthermore, Marc Cherry should not have told the audience what the main characters did with their seperate lives MANY YEARS into the future- this should have been left to the audiences imagination!! However, please keep in mind my criticism only relates to the final minutes of the final episode. The Final Season of 'Desperate Housewives' was consistantly brilliant! I highly recommend you buy ALL 8 Seasons of the show, it will provide you with many years of viewing pleasure!!!
B000GWE44U|4.0|A classic horror film. Still gives me the willies! I don't know who's more disturbed, Stephen King or Stanley Kubrick.
B0061PEAUY|4.0|I enjoyed this book but then I like all the Tempe Brennan books.  I enjoy the books set in Canada the most and this one was mostly set in Yellowknife in the Northwest Territory.  I was glad to see Andrew Ryan back in the picture.  The story was good, had good action and aspects of the story pulled at my heartstrings.  I always enjoy how fearless Tempe Brennan can be...she does not back down from the bad guys!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A+++++   i have to admit this is the first book that i have ever read the whole thing and am gonna read the next one
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great fun - very enjoyable... keeps your attention.  The graphics are excellent.  I enjoy playing this game over and over again.

B005D643PO|5.0|Great fan of the series DEXTER!!!<br /><br />Audio is very low in all videos streaming thru the iPad app from Amazon.  I have to turn volume to maximum to strain to hear, sometimes use ear buds to hear, and still it is low<br />.  Videos from other sources viewed on the iPad the audio is fine.  Please address this issue.  Thank you.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is so awesome. I reccomend to anyone who can read. It is so suspenseful and full of action.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|Ok don't buy this expecting love gun or dress to kill. But buy it and listen and follow lyrics . Best stuff they have written in a while . With all the music available on Internet  this Is what a TrUE. Kiss fan will want  And yes I'm a ace fan and a Peter fan but this a new era in the bands. Career and either you follow down the journey or listen to something else . Go on go . I'm sticking around hehehe
B0096DFBZQ|3.0|My nephew says the game is too fast to not have controllers to use. Other than that it looks cool to me.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Wow, I dont usually write reviews, but wow.  This book grabs you by the neck and does not let go. When you are done reading you want more, not because it leaves you wanting, just simple not wanting it to end.  It does a better job than most with back story and going into such detail that you feel the pains and hopes of the characters.  It brought back memories of my own unique military experiences from training to war.  Some good, some not.  But those experiences made me who I am.  And you can see it in a very believable fashion shaping the characters into what they will become.  No leap of fiath needed.<br /><br />But maybe the highest honor and praise that I can give Anthony Ryan and Raven's Shadow, is that I will be buying when it goes to print.  As much as I love my Kindle, some books you just have to have on the shelf and this is one of them.  I only have one major complaint. That I didnt hear about this sooner. Thank you, Anthony Ryan.<br /><br />MO
B004MC8CA2|4.0|thank you for bringing the Bible to this world I really love God and every thing about him so thanks
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Firstly reading this book was my savour to fill in for the 50 shades books but reading this second book has given me a new liking to the characters. The twist and turns in this book was what made it an amazing read I loved every bit of this book more then the first one all the characters have such strong personalities which you start to warm to cant wait for the next book I really dont ever want this series to end
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Good app. I am stuck on this game, my daughter loves it as well. Thank you for the download. Good game
B00992CF6W|4.0|Not on par with pc or xbox version. Also, redstone does not work. The creative inventory is missing a ton of items that you can craft in survival.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|I'm not so sure . I cant. figure out if there is a way to get more coins with out spending real u.s. moneys. cant just feed it like people do a slot machine...... just want to play for a little fun and to kill some time
B007FG9LIE|4.0|This book Had me confused yet addicted<br />I Couldn't wait to finish the book..I never would have guessed that ending.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is a book my married daughter recommended.  I have since recommended it to others and purchased it as a gift for my sister.  It is a feel good read that is not just fluff-one that you will think about and enjoy on several levels.
B00992CF6W|1.0|why didn't notch make a free version like on apple. it's. not fair for us to not have a free version but they do
B007GCY8FS|2.0|I am a HUGH Lee Child fan.  However, this was an absolute disappointment!!!  I struggled through this book in hopes that it would get better; it did not!!  Don't waste you money purchasing it, borrow it from your local library.  Sadly disappointed!!!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Wool: Omnibus Edition by Huge Howey is a light sci-fi series that actually combines all 5 books in the series into this one volume. If you're like me who didn't hear about this series till now, then you'll be able to save a lot of money by just getting this edition. I don't usually read science fiction but if this is what most of them are like, then please sign me up for more! The story I'm sure many of you have at time or another either read, heard or visualized about in some form or way. In some distant future, the world  outside is made uninhabitable. In order for humans to survive, they are forced to be secluded in an underground silo, never knowing how the outside world is like besides getting some view from a visual sensor or two located outside of the silo. People have been living this way for many, many years. But here's the twist. As punishment for actually talking about the forbidden outside world, these people actually got what they wanted: to be able to actually go outside. At first I didn't really understand what that meant but over time, things will be much more clearer and the fun then really begins!<br /><br />As soon as I read a couple of chapters in the beginning, it just automatically captured my attention. Just the mere fact that these people are confined to a single silo underground made things fascinating. Again, I doubt this is the first time I've heard of this idea but this is I believe one of the first time I actually got to read a book about it. In the beginning, I thought things would eventually get a little stale  due to the silo not being too inhabited with people and whatnot but I was to be proved wrong immediately. You see, I initially thought that the silo they lived in were at most only a couple of floors deep. Well, it turns out that number was actually closer to a hundred and more! The funny thing is that while you would think they are well developed in the technology field, they would somehow find a way to build an elevator! That's right folks. Imagine having to trudge up 20-30+ flight of spiraling stairways just to reach another area of the silo, which is sectioned off into different levels. However, the author does a pretty good job of telling the story while characters traverse these long flight of stairs. In fact, I actually think its the stairs that really add to the total atmosphere within the silo.<br /><br />There are many interesting characters within Wool. Towards the beginning, you're not sure what to make of things from a characters perspective but of course that is to change as you continue reading. Characters are likable and I really liked the pace of the book. Things are happening all the time within the silo. I think the author did a pretty good job also at giving us a visual of the surroundings. People are bustling everywhere and it gives what you would imagine as a place filled with sadness and depression that much more liveliness and excitement! It really does make you think what would happen if you were put in a similar scenario.<br /><br />After having read the entire book, I was just left exhausted but in a good way. So much happens toward the later half of the book that you just can't help but to continue reading. The writing was superb and that's saying something being as how I've never heard of this author before. Some of the later parts concerning Lukas was a tad bit boring but nothing to the extremes. As I said earlier, I'm not a big fan of sci-fi but that's because I'm more of a fantasy reader. However, I'm taking a big break from that genre and reading Wool really sparked my interests in science fiction. When I call it \\"light\\" sci-fi, hopefully that won't offend readers out there. It's just that with Wool, although it is considered sci-fi, it wasn't hard to pick up and understand at all. With some of my past experiences in this genre, I had a hard time following along.<br /><br />With all that being said, I want to congratulate the author on such a successful book/series offering. If nothing else, it really got me interested in giving science fiction another go at it!k/series offering. If nothing else, it really got me interested in giving science fiction another go at it!
0316228532|1.0|What a let down in reading this book. Not worth purchase nor worth the time to check it out in the library. The cost didn't bother me at all but the lack of .... Everything it is not!  It is so true about being inspired in life creates magic. This book was void of any! Very disappointed.
0525953728|5.0|This book arrived in perfect time and in really great shape.  I highly recommend this book to everyone.  Great gift idea!  Great book!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Well worth the money. This book kept me turning pages and everytime I thought I had everything figured out... turns out I was wrong. This author does a great job making believable characters that don't spend too much time hating themselves and aren't ultra perfect. It was a long ride through many years and many scenes but I enjoyed all of it.
B007HGPBRC|4.0|Only wish it was longer....and that the story was not so really sad. He was one of the most significant writers (and characters) of this generation
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I have just gotten my kindle fire I have down loaded a lot of games on to it &amp; the big fish games have been the best ones so far &amp; this game is no different. keep up the good work big fish
B00785P2QC|4.0|I enjoy designing my own city but would like to get upgrades more quickly.  This game offers fun for hours of play.  Wish was this easy to plan actual cities.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I can't get enough of this series, there seems to be no end to what Emily/Amanda will do to get back at those who wronged her.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book truly is destined to become a classic in Sci-Fi.  The characters are thoroughly fleshed out, they act as you would expect given their circumstances, and the plot is bullet-proof.  There are many free/cheap novels on Amazon, but none quite as well-ronded as this masterpiece.  5 STARS!!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I was half way through it before I understood what was taking place.  It was hard to follow because it was back and forth.  Also, it was too drawn out.  In the end I liked it but did not enjoy reading it.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|The funny thing is i don't own a kindle.  I am a avid reader and when a friend of mine wanted to loan me some books from her kindle, I downloaded this app for my smart phone.  I have breaks in my work day that i use to read, and I find this app irreplaceable in its convenience and easy use.  I can even download books from my library onto my kindle app for my phone.<br />Love Love Love this app!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I started reading and was disappointed. It took a long time for me to get into the book. I found myself skimming the pages and skipping things until about chapter 17 and realized I knew two people very very like the main people in this book, minus the bondage. Then it had my attention. But without that connection I wouldn't have enjoyed it at all. I loved the ending. But think I shall not go onto book 2. The writing sometimes was very....simple? I can't think of the correct adjective. Choppy almost. Like \\"see spot run.\\" \\"Spot runs fast.\\" Not that bad but close. Which turned me off of the writing, if not the content.<br /><br />If you want erotica there is better writing. If you want something a bit different or maybe to see how a woman's mind works- ok, it's worth the read.
B008G8SFGO|5.0|I have really been looking forward to this new set, and it is even better than I expected!!! I am really digging Tommy's song, \\"Outta This Word\\" and Eric's \\"All For The Love of Rock & Roll\\".<br /><br />I think this is probably the most solid sounding KISS set....no ballads, no pop...just straight up KISS rock & roll. PLUS, Gene's bass playing sounds better than ever. Paul is STILL my favorite rock voice of all and never lets up. I love Monster from start to finish!!!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|What a great read!!  Who cares if it had a few loose ends.  I couldn't put it down. The author must have an incredible mind to have come up with this plot. It was discussed at my book club last night and every-one had finshed the book even though it was not their usual type of book.  It created great discussion, which is a test of a good book for a club read.<br />Overall - brilliant!!
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|No deep thought needed for this book.  A bit more detail about how to kill people than I needed.  Over all an entertaining adventure.
0802473156|5.0|I purchased this book along with several more marriage, love, respect, and communication books when my husband and I got engaged. I was determined to make sure our marriage got off to a good start with communication being the key (love and respect too, of course). I started reading this book to myself at first but less than half way through it I called my husband (fiancé at the time) into the room and I stared the book over and read it out loud to him all in one sitting. We both talked about the book along they way. At the end of the book there is a quiz to determine your personal love language(s). I do recommend taking the quiz \\"First\\". We both agree it would've helped us understand or tie things together more during the reading.<br />Before this book, my husband would buy me presents all the time to show me he love me, however, that wasn't what did it for me, him spending quality time with me showed me his love for me. Until we read this book we didn't realize what our own love languages were and that day we were able to identify them, talk about them, and start nurturing them.  From that day on, my husband and I started really trying to \\"fill each others love tanks\\".<br />4.5 years later, we are very happy and very much in love. We attribute a lot of the success in our marriage to our wonderful ability to communicate with each other and \\"The Five Love Languages\\" helped us with this.<br />We purchased 12 copies of this book and gave it to all the couples we know in our immediate circle for Christmas. Every one of them have said they took something good away from this book. Highly recommend.<br /><br />* I also recommend the one for children!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|Story a bit unbelievable but great special effects.  I was really into it and the storyline moved quickly.<br />Why is it only the BAD guy, tuned GOOD GUY, can save the world?
0316228532|3.0|The people in this book are wretched and sad, the only good one dies within the first few pages of the book. He had the same limitations yet he managed to survive and thrive. He made a point of trying to help bring those less fortunate along with him. She seems to have picked out the vices she most dislikes in people and assigned them a character in her book. Each has a pronounced problem and you are shown why, they are so well written that I found that I wanted to slap some of them and put my arms around others. The book will hold you and make you think long after about the characters. In a way it seems to be a mirror, you must have the fortitude for self examination and the willingness to see the truth. She lays bare the most base attitudes and behaviors, it is subtle in some and extreme in others and you are made aware of just how much damage can come of it. There are chain reactions through out the book and there is a very tangible sense of how fragile life really is. This book is not a cozy as one reviewer mentioned and while there is humor, it is dark. This book is meant to make you think about yourself, your actions and your attitude towards others.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|My book club met yesterday and everyone agreed--something that doesn't often happen. We ALL love the book! It's a fascinating and intriguing story.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|the graphics were cool and the story intriguing I cannot wait for part two. well worth a dollar or two.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This app is great for me when I need a few minutes to chill and is my favorite board game so far.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|This is his best yet. Creative, intense and spine -tingling to the very end. If you need a great read, this book is it.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I can only agree with other reviewers about this book. I found it extremely enlightening. In the first couple of chapters alone I learned things that I never would have imagined might influence willpower, including meditation, eating well and exercise... Because of their effect on the brain. I chose a \\"willpower challenge\\" as she suggested and so far - a month out - I've stuck to it for longer than I ever have before. But more than that, I feel I have strategies and a helpful perspective on it that I didn't have before. If you're looking for a practical, easy to read, achievable book on willpower, I'd recommend it.<br /><br />On a side note, I also bought the Baumeister book on the same topic and was quite disappointed. I found it quite anecdotal, not very actionable, quite long-winded, and with some strange examples, such as the explorer Stanley being inspired by higher values... which occupied an entire chapter. It read like an attempt at a Gladwell book that didn't quite get there.  If I had to choose between the two, this would be my pick.
B0083SBJXS|3.0|It's the usual smash-em-up nonsense here, with lots of loud banging and crashing for most of the more than 2-hour running time: too long, incidentally. Too many close-ups of Robert Downey Jr.'s mug inside his superhero outfit. I grew weary. The plot is the usual saving the earth from outer-space takeover nonsense. The reviews are a bit over the top. This is just another Hollywood payday for the all-star cast. Nothing special at all.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this a lot on my kindle fire....great app! great for pulling up receipes that I previously pinned so I don't have to boot up the computer.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|This is a fun fame to play. My 4 year old grandson likes to play with me. It's s great learning game.
0345803485|5.0|i couldn't put this book down, and when i did i turned to look at my husband and wish that he would say or do the things that christian grey did in his book.....not so much the sexual acts, but just..well you'll see. definetely worth the read...it's a great vacation book..easy read...even though i read it after i got the kids to bed
B000IZA9PI|5.0|Son was really into it, was his first Start Trek movie.  He did his own review of the movie, on paper.
034580404X|5.0|definetely worth the money as the kindle version was more expensive, it's cheaper than costco, and i didn't want to wait a year to borrow the book from the library.<br />book one was an easy read which i didn't want to put down at all. i'm on book two and it's so captivating. i dreamt of christian grey and at times i looked at my husband and felt as if i was cheating on him with the book. ha! great vacation book as well as de stresser at home....deinetely great author who knows how to bring erotica to life.
0062086529|5.0|I did not realize this was a board book version, I thought it was a hardcover copy.  However, it is a great book and the perfect size for placing in a bag and taking to different places.  My daughters love the book too.
B0099G3I96|5.0|Sounds just like the no doubt we all know and love, these songs would have been at home on tragic kingdom, also great price!!!
0345803493|4.0|I have read the first 2 books of this trilogy.  Really enjoyed both.  Getting ready to start the third, Fifty shades Freed.  While there is a LOT of sex and it is not for the faint of heart, it really and truly is a love story.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Mumford and Sons definitely raised the bar. The musicianship was stellar and the lyrics did a great job of bridging the entirety of the album. I don't think they were as great as \\"sigh no more,\\" but for what the lyrics were intended to do, A+ in execution.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gone Girl is a page turner. Every once in a while a book comes along that doesn't let you stop reading until you're done. That's what Gone Girl was for me. It's dark, yet funny and real. Fantastic writing!!
B005T87QCI|1.0|I start a new game and thinking that it would be fun and all but I couldn't even get past the starting level its a ripoff game that only makes you rage quit with tears HORRIBLE GAME
B009CGYO0K|4.0|I really love The Oatmeal and this isn't a bad book by any means. Mostly, I felt that the new content to old content ratio was off... it seems like I could read half the book on his website for free. Definitely hoped for more new content. That being said, I'm not too bent out of shape on the price I paid for it. The new comics are funny, I skimmed it a few times today while I was bored at work. I generally feel as though the laughs I've gotten from the site over the years are well worth the $8 I paid for the book, even if the new content wasn't.
B003VXOFEU|4.0|I read this book in my reading class my 8th grade year and fell in love with it. I am always questioning why things are and how they work. This book starts by explaining the community and how everything is the same, in black and white, no emotions or feelings, and nothing to ever question. Jonas an 11 year old about to turn 12 is about to get his assignment of being the receiver. The Giver the most important character in the story is an older man with knowledge of the past. A past before the community and before everything was the same. When Jonas started to find out about all of these freedoms and choices people use to have he could no longer be happy in his community. He could not continue with the shallow lives that the people in the community were living. He made a decision to leave the community and with him he took a baby boy named Gabriel. Together they fled the community in hot pursuit. They traveled for a long period of time until he reached a house with bright lights all around it and music playing. It was winter when he made his escape and the only thing to keep him warm was the thought of a very hot day and the sun, and laughter. The book ended before telling us if he reached the house, or if he knocked on the door and humans came out to greet him. This was an excellent read, there was a lot of detail that painted a perfect picture in my mind and the way the author left the ending open for us the reader to interpret what actually happened to Jonas and the baby Gabriel.
B000002KXV|5.0|... after all these years! Grew up in the '70's and '80's for Steely Dan and Donald Fagan familiarity. Nice to hear this music again.
B0087YPIB2|3.0|The storyline of this movie was not as vibrant as I expected.<br /><br />If you have extra time, and want it to pass, then take a look at this video.
B000002MIY|5.0|... after all these years. Grew up in '70's and '80's and loved this tape. Great to hear in the new age!
B00127RAJY|4.0|I'd give this 5 stars except the only really annoying thing about this DVD is that you HAVE TO listen to the introductory blabber EVERY TIME...you can't skip it and just choose which workout (1, 2, 3) you want too do!! How annoying, after watching this DVD for 25 times, I want to just jump right to the workouts, but you can't. Bad design flaw. Otherwise, once you get into the workouts, these are my fave's of her workouts. Can't beat this DVD.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|Easier to use than another alarm app I had, Enjoy the gradual increase in volume setting. Overall works great, no complaints.

B009AJD5E0|5.0|After having watched all of the Aliens movies numerous times, this movie does a fantastic job of both explaining there they came from without giving away too much.
B004J64QSI|5.0|This blu-ray disk of the 25th anniversary Les Miserables concert presentation is wonderful. It looks great on our high def plasma tv and the 5.1 sound is awesome. We originally recorded this presentation when it was broadcast on PBS but this disk, without the PBS fund raising breaks, and with its' very high quality excels.
B0084IG8TM|4.0|Loved the movie not as much as the book but then I don't believe movies ever do justice to books, also the movie ended after what was in the book the first book.. no closer .. for this reason I give this movie 4 stars out of 5
B009B50QOU|4.0|This was a very good album that is a hybrid of old and new sounds from the band.  Loved it
B00846REIS|5.0|This book is simply amazing. If anyone has read 50 Shades of Grey, this should be your next read. This book is like the sister to that book...the better written, more descriptive, sexier sister, that is. I thoroughly enjoyed 50 Shades, but I LOVED this book.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|Eva and Gideon return in the second book to the crossfire series.... Reflected in You. The first book sets the scene for the characters lives past and present and for their love...I couldnt wait for this second book. Which puts their relationship to the test and shows more of their pasts... LOVED IT....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book!  It was very hard to put down and I bought the other two books in the Trilogy before I even finished this one!  Can't wait to see what happens next!  I am already half way through Catching Fire and I am loving that one so far as well. I would highly suggest this book to anyone that loves drama and adventure! Thank you Suzanne Collins for transporting me into another world, where I feel like I am jumping into the scenes and walking along side the characters, feeling their fear and sadness, as well as their anger for what the Capitol is forcing them to do. I am completely enthralled.
B005MJFA2W|5.0|Fun to read it with great insight. Plain English easy to read for a reader with English as second language...
0307346617|2.0|I'm one of those people that prefers books that contain a plot, characters, and so forth.  The interview style was a great premise, but on paper it just works out to be boring because you have no storyline to follow and no characters to connect with. Those elements are usually what makes a book interesting, so without those elements... you get my drift.<br /><br />Also, seriously, If you're going to execute each chapter from a different point of view...then make them sound different! This is starting to become a literary pet pieve of mine, with the increasing popularity of POV books.  If you are not capable, as a writer, of convincingly changing the writing to match the character's personality and point of view, just WRITE A NORMAL SINGLE PERSON NARRATIVE!!!<br /><br />Each point of view uses EXACTLY the same grammar, syntax, etc., peppered with some sort of local slang to let the reader know that we are now hearing someone else's interview.  At many points in this book, I would still think I was reading about the same person until all of the sudden they used a word in Japanese, and then it was like \\"wait a sec... isn't this the little american girl?  Oh wait, no, it's some japanese guy now...wtf?\\"<br /><br />Two stars for creativity and a great premise for a novel... minus three for boringness and poor execution.
B0098VYCCE|3.0|The movie was okay,not one I would watch again.My wife liked it more than myself,it was just hard to fellow at times.

B007FEFLTO|3.0|I love Ken Follett, I've read I believe everything he has written.  I have always anticipated and enjoyed his new releases.  However, I must say this time he let me down.  Parts of this book are very well written and are interesting and exciting.  Parts of it, I found myself saying,WTH???? X is going to happen and it did, and X is going to do X to X and they did.  Prime example, when Lloyd ends up pulling Boy from the cockpit of his crashed plant...YOU have got to be kidding me...I could have written this myself.  I think Mr. Follett, should have paced the novel better, not covered so much time with this one and then there would have been something to look forward to in the third book.  As of now, I don't see any reason to read the 3rd one.  I am afraid that I'm starting to see a \\"and they all lived happily ever after the end\\" and that's just a huge let down from a man that I know has the talent and the ability to do so much more with the subject matter.<br /><br />All in all, it's an OK read, from anyone else this might be more acceptable, but not from this author.  I didn't hate it, but I don't love it either.  I hope I can rustle up the will to read the next installment of the story...sigh.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good game no glitches fun fun fun yeah long review here i  come. love that some are easy and others crazy hard! but i dint know im kind of rambling here
B006OAB3ME|5.0|Delightful surprise to find a Beatle singing classic oldies in such a<br />simple, straightforward, yet jazzy manner. Great music spans the<br />generations, and Paul's renditions do justice to the originals by<br />the masters. Saw the video first on PBS, and had to have the cd to<br />keep the pleasure going. The cover is so apropos. Paul's singing is not<br />a florist's fixed bouquet; his gift is the picking of colorful wild-<br />flowers that just naturally please. He seems to be peekabooing behind<br />them and that fits too, because he lets the timeless songs speak<br />for themselves, and he's just the lovable musician who gathered them<br />and delivered them to us. A most memorable musical bouquet and a<br />timeless gift.<br />  AMAZON VERIFIED REVIEW by \\"Priam's Mama\\"
B007JWKLP6|5.0|Watching this Blu-Ray was transcendant.  The music, the history, the story, the people, the celebration of the wonderful life of George Harrison.  A masterpiece!
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This game is challenging and great fun! Still trying to get all stars on several levels! Get it! It's worth it!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Good writer, original ideas.  The series ends with a lot of unanswered questions so I assume there is more to come, and if so I will definitely purchase.  There is a lot of room for more good stuff in this story line!<br />There are some mistakes with what is physically possible but won't spoil it here, easy to overlook, nothing critical.<br />This author shows promise on top of already good work.
B000FVE3A2|4.0|I looked for a watch that was good size , I looked at all kinds of brands of watch and nothing matched the watch that I purchased. So far it runs good no loss of time so far. There is one thing I wished was better in all watches that has a luminated dial that one can see at night. Great watch Invicta Pro Diver

0307454894|5.0|The book was recommended to me by a friend who insisted that I read it.  Three quarters of the way through the book I was wondering why!  Well the ending makes the reading of the first three quarters all worthwhile.  I understood why my friend wanted me to read the book and I was thankful that I did.  Enjoy
B001NLKXK2|5.0|Dealing with a family member with Dementia/Alzheimers...this book has brought a much different understanding from the patients view of this illness.  My compassion heightened.  It was recommended to me and I'm so glad I listened and read.  I would encourage anyone to read this book. Excellent read!!

B007GCY8FS|5.0|Have read a number of his books and this rates right up there with the best.<br />It was a good lenght and well written for my taste in books.  Thank you.  MARY
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Classic Reacher by Child, but not his best by far.  Seemed to be more hastily done, character and plot development not up to Child's usual standards, but an entertaining read.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is a great read!! i could nit out the book down. save ur time and buy all 3
B009LZDGSI|5.0|I am hooked on this new series. My only quibble is that the NYC cops who work with Holmes are written like cardboard throwaway characters. Only the police captain (played by the ever wonderful Aidan Quinn) is written with a deft touch. One of the things I like about this series (and I watch a lot of detective shows) is that the writers are very inventive about the reason for the murders, and in this episode combine two crimes - a robbery and a murder. Watson continues to try and get Holmes to share his feelings and more information about himself, which backfires when Holmes phones her ex-boyfriend and invites him over to their place for dinner. Watson keeps her work confidential and does not want to share that information with her ex or her family. The case itself revolves around family, an expected inheritance worth millions, and how inventive greedy people can be to claim a massive fortune. Zoe Keating's string pieces from the premiere episode (see my review) make another appearance, and Holmes picks up the violin to play. Great second episode. Let's see where the season takes us.
B004U7MQXS|5.0|This was just as great as expected. Could not have asked for better. The boys at their finest. Wonderful music, comedians, and fabulous song writers. Interesting back stories from producer, director.
B009IJJ712|5.0|I was all set to hate this series since I adore the modern day version of Sherlock created by BBC. I would have been so wrong. This show is extremely well written and the music (almost all available on Amazon) is a mix of modern hits and several string pieces by Zoe Keating (Legions (Aftermath), Optimist, The Path, We Insist).  Holmes is a recovering drug addict who fled London after a relationship went sour, and Watson is tarnished surgeon who has become a sober companion. Holmes hides himself in the one thing he does best - works murder cases, while Watson hides in her comfort zone - helping people heal - but without a scalpel in her hand. Both are tortured souls, but when they combine their knowledge and expertise, they solve homicides that would otherwise turn into cold cases. If you have not seen the show, please give the premiere episode a try and forget their names and just watch. It would be a shame to miss out on a potentially great drama with two wonderful leads.
B00723NWJE|5.0|I liked this album because the music texture is different than her prior albums. The songs I listen to the most are Miriam, Say Goodbye, and She's 22, and Travelin' On. I like the music aesthetic to \\"She's 22,\\" in particular.  I think it's cool that Norah sang as well as played the piano and guitar for the album. She writes her songs, too, along with other musicians. So the music is very much her talent, end to end. I like All A Dream because of its length - 6:30 - created by the long stretches of instrumental sound.
B005DF2QMC|5.0|I have a very dated cassette collection of New Orleans jazz musicians and the DB tech product enabled me to bring it into the digital age.  The product works GREAT and is, after reading a very simple set of instructions, easy to install and use (I'm not technical at all) and when I had a question got better customer service than I did for a $2600 TV set.
B009329ZF2|5.0|This is a very action-packed movie. I really enjoyed watching it. I usually have a hard time staying awake to finish a movie, but I didn't have that problem with this one. It kept me on the edge of my seat. Very good movie
B006LSZECO|3.0|As a fan of this author's first two novels,  Sharp Objects and Dark Places, I was anxious to see for myself what all the hype surrounding her latest novel was all about.Gone Girl, released in June, 2012, and at times I felt like I was the only one who hadn't read this one.  You know how sometimes when there is so much hype, you can get that disappointed feeling when your done?  Yup, that is what happened to me... I felt let down.<br />In this novel, 30-something Nick and Amy Dunne were once a fairly happy young couple living in Brooklyn, NY. Well, on second thought maybe they weren't so happy after all, but I digress. In the 90's both were writers until a downturn in the economy left them both unemployed.<br /><br />When Nick learns that his twin sister Margo has also lost her job and has moved back to their hometown in Missouri to care for their dying parents.  Nick tells his sister that he and Amy will be moving to Missouri as well, doing this without even checking with Amy.  Nick and Margo, borrow the last of Amy's trust fund money to buy a bar in town. Then on the eve of their 5th wedding anniversary Amy goes missing.  She she just leave? Was she kidnapped, or did  Nick have something to do with her disappearance?<br /><br />Told through alternating points of view past and present by Nick (of Amy) and through diary entries by Amy (about Nick) prior to her disappearance, it quickly becomes impossible to determine the truth from the lies. Who's the psychopath?  Both Amy and Nick were equally disturbed, in my opinion, and one thing was certain for me -- they deserved each other.  Honestly, I don't think I've read anything in a long time with (2) such detestable individuals.<br /><br />Although the author did a good job creating an engaging psychological thriller, and the twists and turns were unexpected, the ending aggravated me. In the end I was disappointed at myself for caving to the hype.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game never gets old. The objectives keep you busy, and the path is never boring. I love having this on my Kindle fire because of the bigger screen. This is a fun and unique game!
B0042VJ1PI|3.0|Typical TV fare. Not much substance but a good time killer. Bought it to read on my airplane trip home and nodded off reading it. Was on sale for $1.99 and that's about what it's worth. Most interesting part was trying to match up the characters from whence they came, the TV program CASTLE.
0525953728|5.0|No more hype and rumors, this book is the first hand experience from one of the operators that was on-site when UBL was taken out.  I was very impressed with the honesty and attention to detail within this book.  I'm glad one of the operators on this mission had enough guts to tell it like it really happened to set the record straight.

B003O86FMW|5.0|WOW!!! I could not put this book down!! I think that it was even better than The Hunger Games! I am only taking a break long enough to write this review, before I start on the 3rd book! I can't wait! Read this Trilogy!
140053271X|2.0|this thing was a paperweight from the mint I opened it. and the customer service is just awful. it wont let you go any father unless you register the device and since it would not let me do it I could not use it. went back to the Kindle
B009D0LBRO|5.0|It was very fun, and can be play through hdmi on your widescreen television because the controls are easy. The only thing it needs is updates for more levels - more challenging for experienced rayman players, was a very short game.
B0015346OM|4.0|This book is a vivid, compelling, recount of the downing of three Black Hawk heliocopters<br />in Somolia almost two decades ago.  It's a nonfiction account with all of the qualities of a<br />fiction thriller.  It's obvious that the author immersed himself in detailed research, studying<br />archived bits and pieces of the battle, piecing them together and interviewing many of the combatants involved.<br />As a Vietnam veteran, I found the descriptions of the battles within the battle to be accurate portrayals<br />of war, capturing the fear, bravery, pain, camaraderie, and black humor inevitable in a firefight.<br />If you've ever questioned the sanity of the politicians who get the U.S. involved in domestic disputes<br />such as Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan, this book is another example of why we should stay out of the tribal,<br />internecine affairs of countries that have waged civil wars for centuries and want to \\"win\\" more than they<br />want peace. It is a telling indictment of \\"American Exceptionalisim\\" -- the philosophy that<br />the U.S. has a sacred mission to impose its form of government on any country we deem in need of salvation.<br />I'll reread this book.
B00866H7SS|4.0|Great read.  What a pair of messed up people.  Can't wait to find out in the next book, how two people with such horrible pasts can put their pasts behind them and move forward together.
0525478817|5.0|John Green captivated my attention right away - this book has instantly become my favourite, ever. As a 16 year old girl, I know that teen fiction in this day and age is typically nonsense, but John Green truly gives me hope. His writing is so intense and - for fiction - so lifelike. He doesn't shy away from negative situations. I felt like I could understand Hazel, not feel sorry for her. If you haven't bought and read this book, I suggest you do. Right now.
B008XG1X18|4.0|its still a little spotty and hss a &quot;force close &quot; every other day,  but I 'm glad there's finally an android app for pinterest
B008BM9L72|1.0|It's bad. Fair play to the author, but I don't know how she did it. It's so badly written, it's painful. Sure Christian Gray would appreciate that!
B005FITIDC|5.0|I had read quite a bit on this movie and the storyline.  Read some articles, found it on streaming and thouroughly enjoyed it.  Bought it as a gift for my father...he will love it!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Couldn't put it down! Read the trilogy in a week! I find it very difficult to find a book that keeps my interest, but this exceeded my expectations.
B003K15INU|1.0|There are few books that I do not finish. This was one. When it takes pages and pages and pages to say something that could have been said in a paragraph (and even then, perhaps it wasn't worth saying), well that just doesn't cut it for me. This book dragged unbelievably, and it seemed to jump all over the place. I agree with someone else who said that Roth just kept writing like a very long (and unedited) stream of thought. I could not get into the characters at all. Perhaps to some, this is a great novel, and I am clearly in the minority, but for me - IT STUNK!!
B006H5120E|5.0|3D is better than my expectations. Sound effect is great. There are also considerable added footage. In summary it's a great buy.
B00009AOBI|5.0|this is based on a true story of a teen boy.  see the main teen boy plays as a teen with a disability that his head and face grow big.  from the disability makes his face look deformed.  this shows you how he lived with stress.  and a girl friend.

B0099G3I96|5.0|This album has some of the best No Doubt I've heard.  I like all but one song on here.  It's got everything from ska to dancehall to easy listening.  It's like No Doubt are showcasing all the types of songs they've been able to do before.  Favorite at the moment: Push and Shove.  Can't believe it got bumped for second single by \\"Hot\\" or \\"Think I'm Hot\\" - whatever the song is called.
B0050DZN4K|3.0|I'm an iOS user who recently purchased a 7\\" Kindle Fire HD and was looking for a \\"stylish\\" app to use for my Google Reader account. On iOS I use Reeder, which has a great interface but is not available for Android devices. I purchased this app on my Kindle and was excited to dive in and check out my feeds but experienced a log-in error (\\"bind error\\" was the exact message) as soon as I tried. The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 1 is because on the right platform, it appears to be a good app; unfortunately, the developers have some work to do.
B0099G7KDQ|4.0|Mumford and Sons set the bar really high with the smash success of their first record \\"Sigh No More\\". With the release of \\"Babel\\" they've proved they are not a one hit wonder. It's a set of 12 really strong songs led by \\"Babel\\" and \\"Black Crown\\". You won't go wrong putting these songs at the top of your playlist.
B000008LOV|5.0|I was staying abroard for the first time in my life when this album came out. Upon reading about this band and seeing them on MTV, I bought a cassette of this album. It always gave me pleasure and strength.<br /><br />This is truely a godsend album. They were a one-of-a-kind in the histroy of rock and roll.<br /><br />What makes this album special is that they never meant to be a \\"super group\\" to make a lot of money. It obvious they enjoyed making an album together. The joy of playing good music is found every where on this album.<br /><br />It was sad that Roy Orbison died soon after this album released. But now I think he made it in time to be a part of the Wilburys. His unique velvet voice makes this album even more special in combination with the four other different distinctive voices.<br /><br />We must thank George for making this possible. Think of the Concert for Bangladesh, he was the only one who could make this miracle happen.
B007FLHW3K|4.0|I bought these for the 8 yr old twin boys next door.<br />after installation, and several trips up and down the street, they think i'm a hero that gives great gifts....

B008Y5OW20|5.0|If you love ELO/Jeff Lynne, then you'll love Long Wave 5 stars worth.  If you are not a fan, 3 stars.  But, as a fan speaking, what a pleasure it is to hear this guy with fresh material, even if they are \\"old\\" songs.  I'll be listening to this over and over again like I have all other ELO/Jeff Lynne work for decades.  This guy is outstanding.  And he's a real nice/decent person in real life too.  Hint, if you like these \\"old\\" songs, consider getting Jeff Lynne's Armchair Theatre as well.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|What a fun game to play. Simple mind-resting yet refreshing.  Good graphics in game. Try it!  fair price. But be careful it is addicting.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Okay, so it cuts the Waterloo scenes, I think a lot of people will be grateful for that.  I've read the original version, but misplaced my copy, wanted to grab the copy as I was going on a trip, and grabbed this kindle copy, because, well, it was free.  The heart and blood of this novel lives, it's easily read, it's a quick read, even at 900+ pages.  I have no doubt that you will enjoy this book amply.<br /><br />The story of Jean Valjean is the story of the human spirit, it is a story which lives inside the heart of everyone that reads this book.  Sentenced to 5 years for stealing a loaf of bread, and an additional 14 years for trying to escape, spending nineteen years of his life in prison, until finally let out on parole, he is treated horriby in a world that doesn't treat ex-convicts like other people.  He meets a friendly priest who takes him into the house and after an incident, one kind act of forgiveness changes him forever, and makes him a new man.<br /><br />Les Miserables translates into The Miserable Ones, and though the characters can be seen as depressing occasionally, this story raises the soul, and brings you to truly loving the story, and feeling renewed and valuing everything in your life a little bit more.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this book.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Typical Mumford and Sons, beautiful and catchy tunes!  I love their new CD because it has a different feel than their first CD but with everything you loved about the Sigh No More.  Would love to hear them live, I'm sure it would be an amazing show!!!
B000V7FZ7U|5.0|For me, the hallmark of a great band is the ability to recreate their signature recording sound live on stage. And if this had been the only measure of success in the music world, Simply Red would certainly be right near the top of the all-time greats list. I thoroughly enjoyed the performance on this DVD from that perspective - they sound as great (or better) as on any of their studio albums. Mick Hucknall is an amazing singer and his voice is perfect in this concert, and the band is simply outstanding.<br /><br />Video and audio quality is very good. Mick keeps the chatter between songs to a minimum but manages to engage and thrill a very receptive audience nonetheless. I am usually not a fan of the \\"audience sing-along\\" style of concerts (I want to hear the artist!), but thankfully it doesn't happen that often here and does not really detract from the quality of an outstanding performance. Well worth the time and money.
0525953728|3.0|I boought this book becuase the hype around it. and thats all it was, hype... the book is ok. Not my fav, however its a nice book to put on my shelf. The pics are very nice and the accounds are detaled, so if my son needs to do a report one day it will be a nice book to have.

0618001905|4.0|A century before the campaign to support Darfur and the anti-Apartheid struggle of the 1980s there was the Congo, an international humanitarian movement propelled by celebrity endorsements (Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Mark Twain) and stoked by graphic images of the atrocities that happened there, which horrified and outraged and inspired action.  Adam Hochschild tells this largely forgotten story with skill, passion and authority.<br /><br />Three characters dominate the storyline: Belgian King Leopold II and his two bête noires, the former shipping clerk E.M. Morel and the British consular agent Roger Casement.  (The intrepid and widely celebrated but deeply flawed and quirky explorer Henry Morton Stanley makes a strong showing, too.)  Leopold, Morel and Casement make for a fascinating trio.  So fascinating, in fact, that often couldn't help wondering if the sketches Hochschild provides are more caricature than authentic biographical profile.<br /><br />Leopold, in the author's telling of the story, is a psychopath.  There is no other word for it.  He ascribes to the Belgian king a diabolical conspiracy of epic proportions.  He claims that Leopold carefully and deliberately duped the world community into recognizing his personal suzerainty over an enormous swath of Central Africa encompassing the basin of the great Congo River not as a conquering imperialist, but as a benevolent patron dedicated to uplifting and protecting the natives, promoting Christianity, ending the Arab slave trade, and dedicated to economic growth via international free trade.  It was all a sham, Hochschild says.  The kind was \\"an illusionist.\\"  Far from the selfless humanitarian he professed to be, he was in fact a shrewd, calculating, rapacious monster, a megalomaniac bent on extracting from the helpless natives as much wealth as could be driven out of them by fear, intimidation, torture and the dreaded hippo hide chicotte whip.  At first it was ivory (the object of Mr. Kurtz's obsession in Joseph Conrad's \\"Heart of Darkness,\\" a story that Hochschild stresses is a true-to-life depiction of life in the Congo in the 1890s and not a parable as many literary critics have claimed).  But then, with Dunlap's invention of the inflatable tire, it was rubber, which could be harvested immediately but with great difficulty from the natural rubber vines that were found all over the Congo rainforest, that allowed Leopold an enormously lucrative opportunity to exploit before the new rubber tree plantations around the world could mature and glut the market with a cheaper product.<br /><br />What troubled me with this aspect of the story is that Hochschild attributes to Leopold such horrible motives and often cites such damning evidence (e.g. \\"I will give them my Congo, but they have no rights to know what I did there\\") but nothing is footnoted and there is no incontrovertible evidence that he knowingly and deliberately ran a terror regime.  Indeed, Leopold never even visited the Congo (and neither did his chief antagonist, E.M. Morel).  I have no doubt that the atrocities Hochschild describes with such cringing clarity are true; I'm just not convinced that Leopold could be convicted in a modern court with the material the author presents.  Yes, the king was a bad man in many ways:  a lecher who kept a teenage prostitute as his mistress when he was in his 70s, who disinherited his daughters, who extracted vast riches from the Congo but who refused to repay the generous loans he took from his Belgian government.  But did he personally direct and promote a regime that tortured, took women and children hostages to ensure quotas were met, that lopped off the hands of anyone who resisted them, all in an effort to boost the rubber harvest?  Probably, but not beyond a reasonable doubt.<br /><br />So what was the upshot of Leopold's 23-year-rule in the Congo (1885-1908)?  Hochschild claims it led to a 50% reduction in the native population - or roughly 10 million deaths - andresulted in over $1 billion of profits in modern dollars directly into Leopold's pockets.<br /><br />If Leopold was evil incarnate, the two heroes of the narrative, Morel and Casement, were giants among men.  Not infallible by any means: Morel could be domineering and egocentric; Casement could be self righteous and unstable.  But they were both skilled public relations and fund raising experts who were perceptive, indefatigable, and deeply committed opponents of Leopold's regime in the Congo.  A reign, it must be noted, that was even by Hochschild's own admission, no more bloody or exploitative than the French and German occupied territories adjacent to the Belgian Congo.  The campaign that Morel led almost single-handedly since its founding in 1898, the Congo Reform Association, and which was buoyed by the authoritative and explosive investigative consular reports supplied by Casement, was one of the greatest and most successful humanitarian campaigns of the twentieth century.  As Hochshild writes, \\"Almost never has one man, possessed of no wealth, title, or official post, caused so much trouble for the governments of several major countries.\\"<br /><br />The post-Congo phases of their careers are especially notable.  Morel emerged as the leading voice in the anti-war movement in England during WWI, earning a six-month hard labor sentence and losing many of his friends and former benefactors because of it, but who emerged as a hero to the Left and the new Labour Party, culminating in his election to Parliament in 1922 over a former Cabinet minister named Winston Churchill.  Casement, on the other hand, turned strident Irish nationalist, collaborated with the Germans during WWI, was captured after a foolhardy landing from a German submarine on an Irish beach and was subsequently hung for his traitorous acts, the first Knight to be so executed in centuries.  His homosexuality was also revealed after he was captured and investigated, which further damaged his reputation.<br /><br />In sum, \\"King Leopold's Ghost\\" is an excellent and lively narrative on a long forgotten story that absolutely deserves to be re-told.resulted in over $1 billion of profits in modern dollars directly into Leopold's pockets.<br /><br />If Leopold was evil incarnate, the two heroes of the narrative, Morel and Casement, were giants among men.

B008BGNMZU|5.0|I own all of the super jazz group FOURPLAY albums and each is a true work of art. The effort applied to each recording is nothing but a painstaking labor of purest love. each album is a complete contrast to what is going on in the world today. They take you to a dimension of complete peace. Each is indeed a dose of tranquility and ESPRIT DE FOUR (THE SPIRIT OF FOUR) is no exception. One observation..as a longtime fan I am detecting predictability (though not a problem.)<br />This jazzy,smooth record, with ten pieces total is worth every penny. Songs are..\\"DECEMBER DREAM\\", \\"FIREFLY\\" is my very most loved effort here, very well done!.\\"VENUS\\" is just so relaxing, another excellent effort. Fast and swift is \\"SONNY MOON\\", followed by the most tranquil yet busy \\"PUT OUR HEARTS TOGETHER\\". NATHAN EAST'S vocal caress on the sensuous \\"ALL I WANNA DO\\" is so fitting here. \\"LOGIC OF LOVE\\" is like an autumn wind, so cool.. \\"ESPRIT DE FOUR\\" is like a fusion of jazz and R&B, it's pretty good as well. \\"SUGOI\\" is another favorite too, with a little oriental essense, it's sure to please. Then finally is the vocal version of \\"PUT OUR HEARTS TOGETHER\\" with Japan's lady crooner SEIKO MATSUDA, she sounds very well.<br />An album you can relax to, an album you can meditate to, an album you can be alone with, an album to set the mood, an album for any pleasing occasion...A precious gift indeed..I can't keep it to myself..FOURPLAY has shared it with me, so allow them to share it with you..

B008673ZAQ|5.0|AMAZING!!!! I have never been on such an emotional rollercoaster ride when reading a book. Eva and Gideon's story is heartwrenching, I actually cried for the last 20% of the book. The author has written an amazing love story that is filled with such real and gritty emotion that I will recommend it to my friends. Can't wait to see what happens in the final book!!!
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Great quick read.  Loved the characters. Fast paced story.  Never a dull moment. Leaves you wanting more.Hoping for a sequel.
B0002KQNL8|3.0|I really love this movie. I love the fact that it is more of comedy than zombie movie. But I think I will listen to the reviews that are posted, save my money and look for an original cut of this movie. I don't want to take a chance of buying it and not liking the way the music is set up with the movie like everyone is saying. Thanks Amazon but I am sure you can help me with my next purchase.

B0085Z8F4A|5.0|After seeing the film, I was surprised by the negative comments about the plot.  Personally, I saw no need for a sequel.  I found the film incredibly engaging, especially when you consider the symbolism it contains.  Each character represents a different perspective on faith and a different approach to life.  The story unfolds as people seek answers and react to the answers they receive.  Some are disappointed. Some are harmed.  Some are inspired to seek more. I thought it was a clever examination of human nature and the lives we all lead.  Some will say I am reading too much into it.  I doubt few Christians will feel that way.  They are familiar with spiritual quests and interacting with the reactions of the many kinds of people the film depicts. In addition to that, it's an amazing 3D experience.  The director clearly knows how to use (and not abuse) the new perspective 3D films can offer.

B000Y7U98W|5.0|Amazing direction by Danny Boyle.  The best part of the movie for me was the performance by Cillian Murphy who is the most underrated actor.  He brought that character to life with a memorable performance.  In spite his unbelievable good looks, he is an incredible actor.
B005USZML4|3.0|This was my first read of a Theodore Boone book, I found it a little slow moving and boring. I prefer a little more suspense and not so predictable.
B000OVLINI|5.0|I checked out this book bacause it was on the Goodreads top books list and because a review said it had a bit of Umberto Eco in it. It was intelligent, spooky, suspenseful, humourous, and poignant. I couldn't put it down and will probably read it a few more times.
B009A3NGF4|2.0|This album does not deserve 4 1/2 stars. Every song is formulaic by starting off soft and building to climaxes suddenly with the banjos jamming. I've listen to \\"Sigh no More\\" and if you want something that works for the first time, listen to that album instead. There are albums that stick with you and are worth time and attention, but this seems like a crowdpleaser, for those who want more or less the same as SNM, but with far less conviction.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love it so far. It's a great way to share all sorts of things with others including recipes, home decorum and fashion.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|I did not get to see the movie, my son saw it and said it was awsome meaning we will buy the dvd.
B00908DDZM|5.0|I must say, this is my first product review...EVER. To be honest, \\"The Heist\\" is the first physical CD I've bought in forever. As an avid listener of Macklemore, I felt I owed it to him to buy the full album. He has just set the bar of modern day hip-hop to a whole new level. With Ryan Lewis's incredible beats and Macklemore's crisp voice and lyrics, the duo has outdone themselves with this outstanding product. I would highly recommend this album. Don't torrent it. It's worth the money, I guarantee it.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this is a great app.other reviews say it isnt loud but its getting louder every time. But its realy good i sugesst it.
B005CRQ3LG|4.0|My two year old grandson will love it! Bright colors and catchy words. I'm sure we will be reading this one often.
B005LAIHPY|2.0|I did not like  'Battle: Los Angeles'. It had corny dialogue, irritating shakey cam, and a plot line you didn't want to spend any brain power to decipher.  'Battleship' thought makes Battle:LA look like 'Battleship Potemkin' in comparison. One of the most poorly executed films of the year, 'Battleship' will certainly find a home in some future 'Mystery Science Theater' show or midnight cult classic screening. If only it took itself a little less seriously and ramped up the humor, it could have been a perfect 'park your brains in neutral' hoot.<br /><br />The film will probably find it's audience anyway among the perpetual 8-years olds among us and might even make back the obscenely large amount of cash it cost to produce. The script is awful and the acting is wooden and embarrassing. Watch Liam Neeson stumbled throught this film and feel sorry for him. Count up the bad lines written into the script and feel pity for the actors.  Luckily the use of CGI is very good  Water effects are very difficult to do. We have seen this CGI before but love for cinema visual trickery will still has us thrilled with the scenes of battles on the ocean between the US Navy and invading aliens.<br /><br />The non-actors, or perhaps they are actual Navy vets that were recruited to play battleship on the USS Missouri were also fun to watch.  They outshined the regular cast by their mere presence and physical reality.<br /><br />We also should celebrate the presence of another of the film's standout performance, so to speak, that of Brooklyn Decker's chest. It should have gotten an ending credit in itself.<br /><br />This film 'Battleship' is what happens when you attempt to base a movie on a board game. No story, no character, and enough plot holes to drive a battleship through. Suprisingly enough  the producers manage to insert the actual board game into the plot near the end of the film about some sort of grid-like tsunami warning system which will have most of the more knowledgeable audience members scratching their heads in disbelief at its sheer stupidity. But hey, after the opening scenes comical missteps, we could believe anything. 'Battleship' is filled with military errrors. It is the type of film that would have actual Navy personnel rolling in the aisles watching all the mistakes make about military life. Incredulity begins almost immediately after the start of the film when we are offered a lengthy barroom brawl, car chase, break-in sequence with Taylor Kitsch in search of a chicken taco which would then have us believe that Taylor Kitsch could then joins the Navy as an officer and in the next scene (with little of no time transition) appears to us as a Navy lieutenant. If we could believe that,  we could believe anything.<br /><br />Watch this film, for free if you can, if you need an evening of emptiness or if you like CGI work. Otherwise save your time and read a book instead.
0756697875|5.0|the front cover binding was torned in two places and dented in one place. I am a batman collector and would not buy this book at a store in this conditon
0545265355|5.0|I found the books incredible as well as an easy read.  Having the set allowed me to go from one to the other - just as fast as I could read. The set of books arrived in pristine condition.
B000GCFG7E|5.0|I can't get tired of Reacher... such a fantasy of a good man doing what needs to be done.  We need people like him in our world.
B008ODZEQ0|5.0|When I heard that a documentary about Jiro had been made, I wanted to watch it right away. It not only fulfilled my expectations, it also got me begging for more footage.<br />Jiro, a 85 years old sushi chef with 3 Michelin Stars in his restaurant tells about his life, his routine, and his family. Oh, and most importantly, his sushi.<br /><br />You'll enjoy it if you:<br /><br />- Love Japan, Japanese food, and sushi in particular.<br />- Are meticulous or, at least, like attention to detail.<br />- Are a gourmet.<br /><br />Don't watch it if you:<br /><br />- Get bored with details or slow-paced documentaries.<br /><br />For me, it's just perfect.
B002KS1IJC|4.0|I am always hunting between amazon and netflix for something worthy to watch. I am biased to sci-fi and fantasy and was surprised when this caught my eye. This flick is definitely worthy of your time and couple of bucks. Good story - acting and scenery. Gore and some cussing, no T an A. Not for little ones. If you like this kind of monster fantasy you'll be entertained.
B003F3NDWG|4.0|Shipping from Amazon was fairly quick as usual even though I use the free shipping option when possible. They don't usually penalize you for using it. The second season is my favorite, though the third season started out strong. It had it's ups and downs including the final.
B007TBZ63Y|4.0|From the very begining I was hooked. The plot twists and turns had me gasping with every word, and the ending nearly killed me with its anticlimatic cliffhanger. I could not stop reading with the final chapters. Only flaw was the POV, which I thought needed a little bit of the others. All in all, truly the work of the gods.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I like the game its nice to play. Its also entertaining and educational. I like it Aa lot so yeah that's all.
B008LSVL6U|5.0|If you enjoy the whole Porcupine Tree/Steven Wilson canon, this is one you will not want to miss.  I had the opportunity to witness the performance in Orlando and it was one of the best \\"small scale\\" shows I have ever scene. That show was pretty early on in the tour. Obviously, time together on the road has been favorable to this lineup.<br /><br />This to me is one of the best productions, the total package, I have ever seen.  Musically, visually and production wise, there is no one else doing what SW is doing at this point.  This performance is a master work.  It is very heavily based on all of SW various musical influences and is backed up across the board by a magnificent group of musicians and production staff that take SW's vision and realize it fully.  I feel you will be hard pressed to find any other product in the music industry, that meets the standards he brings to this DVD.<br /><br />SW has worked with these people just off the top of my head.  King Crimson/Robert Fripp, Jethro Tull, Gentle Giant, Alex Lifeson, Opeth/Mikael Akerfeld, Marillion/Fish (and other ex-Marillion bandmates), Dream Theater, Steve Hackett, etc., and that isn't even considering the Porcupine Tree and his solo collaborations with some of the best musical performers and minds in the industry.  Trust me, he would not get that kind of mind share if he wasn't on to something.  This is an evolution in Progressive music that is driving a bit of a revival in the genre and he is hitting on all cylinders in this project.  This DVD is evidence.  When Steven Wilson is old and grey, he will be known as the mastermind that he is.  This performance, this band, may well be his biggest masterpiece yet, and that is saying quite a lot for this guy.<br /><br />I know it might be a stretch, but I actually see this as a continuation of one of the themes from Floyd's \\"The Wall\\".  If you look at that seminal album as a dichotomy of building isolation through the emotional and environmental influences that Waters had experienced, this takes it a step further and maybe even in reverse.  He is starting the journey of this performance off from a base that all of his influences are with him here now and this is where he goes with them.  This is a journey and it is full to the brim with magnificent ideas and masterful music.  These guys can bring it and they do the entire show.  Marco Minneman on drums, Nick Beggs on bass, Theo Travis on flute/sax, and Adam Holzman on keys...make no mistake, these guys are all top tier in their respective areas.  It is no wonder, after seeing what this line up is capable of, Guthrie Govan (maybe the world's most versatile guitarist?)jumped on board and they immediately retired to the studio with none other than Alan Parsons producing, for the next album.  I can't wait to see what they come up with next...the power behind this lineup is undeniable.
1619491486|2.0|I have read this book, Lady Chatterly's Lover, several times, but was really surprised by the format and publication of this copy. There were several things that I was suspicious about that made me feel like this was definitely a bogus copy. The format of the writing and pages were terrible with lots of spacing within the paragraphs and sentences. When I looked for a copyright , publication or date published there was nothing on the tittle page, on the book or in the back of the book. There was nothing! How can Amazon sell or have a seller send out a bogus book ? Aren't there certain copyrights on books that have already been published and if some one produces a copy of that book, shouldn't there be some identification as the the who, what and where it was published???  Don't have my shipping information and can't pull it up on my account, but would like to identify the seller and report them to the Amazon police!!!!!
B00881VLCE|4.0|I love the puzzles. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is that it doesn't tell you which puzzle you are working on if you close the app with the puzzle unfinished.  I wish it would bookmark the puzzles that are incomplete.  Otherwise the game works well on Kindle Fire and there are plenty of FREE puzzles to add to your collection.
B00846REIS|5.0|Bared to You will be a book I will reread over and over from now on. It rates up there with Fifty Shades of Grey although they are similar the difference is what will keep me coming back.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I think this game is perfect.  if ur one of the people that hare this game.....I DONT CARE ABOUT IT.....
B007J4T2G8|5.0|For me the love story between Ana and Christian just reached out from the pages and grabbed me right from the beginning and I found it hard to put the book down until it was finished. It is definitely a book to reread over and over and I have.
B0091V6TF4|5.0|If you are a Bond Fanatic like me, then you MUST buy the 50th anniversary Bond CD.<br />I pre-ordered it and it was deliver this morning. It is a 2 disk set. Great for collectors or just cool to have, It has the most amzing clear sound all of the classic bond songs sung by the original artits [[ASIN:B0091V6TF4 Best Of James Bond 50th Anniversary (2 CD)]]and Instramentals. Some of the featured songs are Goldfinger sung by Shirley Bassey, View to a kill by Duran Duran, Die another day by Madonna and of course the Casino Royal theme You know my name by Chris O'Connel. WHEW!!!! You will love it.<br />P.S. Sorry , No Adelle for Skyfall an this track. You have to pre-order for Nov.movie release.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|If you can get over the ick factor of the rats, you will love Ratatouille.  The premise of this movie is really a stroke of madness or genius.  A rat who likes to cook and is a phenom.  Trust me, it works and I am now a fan of all things Brad Bird.<br /><br />Recently with the advent of Spongebob Squarepants cartoons have progressively become dumber or increasingly sexual.  What happened to the great Merry Melodies and Looney Tunes era?  The downgrade began with the death of Mel Blanc and it was all over by the time they joined forces with Michael Jordan.  Sharp, funny and cutting humor in cartoons is now replaced with spastic toilet humor.  So wrong for so many reasons.<br /><br />I am not a fanboy of extras.  But I couldn't resist watching these extras and they really do add value to the purchase, particularly the history of rats (ick but interesting).<br /><br />I can't say too much without revealing the plot but if you are a foodie and you like good clean fun, pick this movie up.  I've watched it many times over and as a foodie it works.  I own 2 of them, plan to give one away to a fellow foodie.  I'm sure he'll wonder why an adult is giving him an animated cartoon movie.  After he sees it I fully expect his deep thanks.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I am so glad I read Timekeeper. It was thought provoking and very well written. I'm going to read other books by this author soon.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is fun and challenging...when I can get at it to play!  Since I loaded it onto my Kindle Fire, my daughter has taken over and plays it all the time!  I must hide my Kindle from her, haha!!  Great fun!

B00563M11M|5.0|Thank you for the laughs once again Sir Pratchett.<br />I have read every Discworld novel and I personnally loved them all...some less, some more...but all of them I have found fascinating. I love Sam Vines and really enjoyed that in this book he was taken out of his element...it was hilarious to see him deal with the country and country folk...you just can't get the pragmatic copper out of Sam :) I also really enjoyed spending time with Sam and his family, including Willikins...I am just truly amazed at how all his characters evolve over time and the way he has them interacting is mindblowing. This author has got the most creative and funny mind...!<br />I enjoyed the balance between the usual trademark humour and parodies that make the Discworld such a joyful place to visit and the more serious points out of real world issues too.
B0063IH60K|4.0|standard solitaire, great free app but the adds between games are decieving. just click on thw black part of the screen to skip
B009CREQJS|5.0|The actual album is great, Very reminiscent of Dookie. It's good to hear the band come back to that sound after all these years. I personally really liked American idiot and 21st century breakdown. This album comes in where those two albums left off musically in my opinion. And then also brings in some dookie as well as other albums in between. For me it's not my favorite album, but that doesn't means it's not good by any means. one of my favorite Green Day songs is now Let yourself Go. Perhaps the rest of the album will grow on me in time. but as soon as i heard Let yourself Go I was hooked. It's nice a regular album after 10 years. I was worried Green day would always try to out do them self's after the success of American idiot. But then again this is only one of the albums to be released in the next six months. The extra videos were nothing special I'm sure you can find them on line somewhere. I actually wish I had saved three dollars and just got the single album for 5. if you are considering getting the deluxe I suggest getting the albums and saving money.
0307383415|3.0|Am still reading this book (10/12/12) but have already seen the trend. This is a book by a politition that reeads his past in a manner to color his future. Do we all? I think to some extent but not negative thoughts, one hopes.
B00000JPH6|4.0|Haha, this film was more interesting than I thought it would be. It reminded me of a cross between evil muppets, the neverending story, star wars, and an adventure quest movie. Quite well done for 1982 - it's always intriguing to watch old movies and see how special effects were like back then.<br /><br />The cracking of the dark crystal leads to two races appearing - the evil Skeksis and gentle Mystics. Jen, the gelfling, adopted by the Mystics is sent on a quest to find the missing shard of the dark crystal after his Mystic master dies. The film gets more interesting as it progresses, especially after the apperance of Kira. Other strange creatures are also introduced throughout.(Fizzgig is cute!)
B006LSZECO|1.0|I've read about a quarter of this book and I truly haven't picked it up again in weeks.  It does not hold my interest at all. I don't care for the unnecessary bad language. I guess the mystery about the book is what is going on? Nothing, nothing has happened so far! I won't trust Whoopie Goldberg's book recommendations again! It was a waste of my money.
B005CAAVVQ|5.0|Don't play this unless you want to dance. Great music. Unique talent. Never heard of him before and I loved it.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Very good processor. I would recommend this to anyone who is interested in a gaming or a regular home desktop. The integrated graphics are very good for being integrated.
034580404X|4.0|I think this is a cute, amusing and nice story. I got the trilogy as a gift from a friend. a very sweet gift indeed.
1449410243|5.0|If you like The Oatmeal, buy it, if you don't like The Oatmeal, move along. Yes, it's a comic with profanity in it.<br /><br />It's one of those things that if you aren't sure you'll like it, there is a possibility you won't. Or you're already a fan, in which case you bought it already.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Down loaded this game before a road trip.  Simple enough to play. I couldn't stop playing. I'm addicted.  Need more coins.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|This is so addictive but it takes so long to get your coins built up if you do not purchase them.  Love the game.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|This endless runner is nice a little cute and easy to access because of no 3d graphics people with lower end hardware or no Google play can play this popular ios game thanks to Amazon market. I wouldn't call it addicting. I don't get enough money in a run for anything so saving becomes a long process. The game never crashed on me or slowed down so that's good.
0333982231|5.0|A snail gets tired of the status quo and decides to set sail on a whale to see the world. During the trip, he helps rescue the whale when he gets stranded, proving that no one is insignificant and anyone can be a hero. When the snail returns, his friends decide they want to branch out too and see what they have been missing by living on the same rock all their lives. They all set sail on the tail of the whale!
0525953728|2.0|Book is combined poorly, with an early page skipping to a late page, then coming back to a spot and repeating the other.
0545157617|4.0|This story is about a stick that is picked up by a dog, then various other people/animals until he ends up in a fireplace. Santa ends up brining him back home to his family's tree. Cute story that takes place over the course of a year.
B006G83G2O|5.0|A terrific, slow read.  Not a novel to whiz through, but one to be slowly enjoyed. Looking forward to more from this writer.
0803726570|5.0|Just because the main character is a witch doesn't mean this book should be lumped into the holiday section. It is a cute story about a witch who keeps dropping things as she flies. Every time she stops to retrieve the items, various animals ask to ride with her on the broom. In the end, the broom is loaded down and it breaks. The witch is captured by a dragon but all her animal friends rescue her in a surprising way. Cute story about friendship and helping others.
B008OJ291W|2.0|If you read the liner, Jeff talks about improving on the originals.  After a couple of listens I think this CD was done to improve his wallet without much work.<br /><br />I love ELO and have been a fan since day one.  Jeff is brilliant as a singer and producer.  His work with the Petty, Orbison, and Harrison is superb.<br /><br />What I wanted was new interpretations of songs (say an acoustic version of Strange Magic) or added oomph to them with an actual orchestra.  Instead we get a slightly tweaked remake of classic songs that have appeared on numerous CDs.<br /><br />A few of these remakes are OK, others like \\"Do Ya\\" are miserable, not close to the quality of the original.<br /><br />Really disappointing from such a great artist.
B0058PJ6NE|1.0|Whats goin on? Works great most of the time. Needs an Update! Come on now its been almost a week now. 1 STAR Status
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game soooooo much and I. don't know any one who has played the game that bated it once again I'm In love with this game
B0040JHL7W|5.0|I have been a loyal brooks adrenline user for 2 years now and these are great running shoes.  This is my fourth pair! After about 200-300 miles, I have to trash them.  They have great support for someone who pronates like myself!
B008N1V11U|4.0|Gameplay a little buggy at times but for. 25 was more than worth it.  Probably better than the Batman Begins game that came out years ago for major game consoles
B005LAIHYU|3.0|I am a Classic horror fan, and I had low expectations for this film. But this is a good movie, if not great. Acting was very nicely done with it set in real 1860s. Nice story with good special effects. Take a chance if you like this genre. You will not be disappointed I hope!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I eagerly anticipated a good mystery....it started slowly and I did not think well written...but then it seemed to take off and held my interest. I was very disappointed in the ending as I thought...\\"this is some weird couple\\"....but I of course loved reading on my Kindle...light easy to read in bed and I could make the font as big as I needed ....so yeah Kindle...and little yeah for the book iteslf.
B00004XPPE|5.0|I saw this movie at the drive in Alice Springs when it first came out - I knew that I would find the age of the special effects different given the technology available to movie makers today - but the staging and the story still stand up despite the age of this film. I still found it gripping and was totally caught up in the drama unfolding as the US President and his Russian counterpart negotiated a response to a situation where a normal security exercise turned into a nuclear fatality of massive proportions which threatened to throw the world into full scale nuclear war. Cold war drama at its best - definitely worth watching again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was very enjoyable to read, it was a good follow-up to the first book, they flowed together very well.  The author did a great job on these books. Fun to read!
B003W77SAS|1.0|I have been and always will be a huge ELO fan. After a tremendous run of artistic and commercial success with ELO, ELO 2, On The Third Day, Eldorado, Face The Music, A New World Record and Out of the Blue ELO pushes their credibility off a cliff with this pop, disco trash. I remember how betrayed and disappointed I was when I first heard \\"Shine a Little Love\\". This album marked the end of ELO for me. While almost returning to form with 1981's TIME (ELO with no string section? Bah!)ELO, beginning with Discovery began a long slow descent into rubbish with its weakest songwriting and bad sounding records. Lynne would soon redeem himself with the absolutely incredible Traveling Wilburys and would go on to have phenomonal success as a record producer throughout the 90s and 2000's.<br />The only thing I like about Discovery is the album artwork.
034580404X|2.0|I'm just getting started with the book - I've heard it's very erotic.  I'm finding it a little shallow - character development specifically.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I played this CD today and all I have to say is that if you don't like Barbra, buy this CD and you will be enlightened by her magnificent voice and musicianship.<br />If you like her, you will love her even more.<br />Many singers have great voices, but when you master both the vocals and excellent musicianship.........WOW! This new CD reminds me why Barbra Streisand is the best artist of all time. The vocals are impeccable, the songs flow flawlessly, and by far one of the best compilation CD's she's ever made. Bravo Babs! One of my favorite songs \\"With One More Look At You\\"........I have listened to it over and over and over again, and still cannot believe this version was kept in the vault. Thank you Barbra for releasing such a great CD. This is a must for all music lovers, you will not be disappointed.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|City of Ashes was absolutely brilliant!<br />In City of Ashes the story of Clary and all the other charachters continue and it is an amazing story full of suspence, a few unexpected turns and humor...<br /><br />There nothing more I can say about this book except : on to the next one!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is like Chuck E Cheese, without having to spend any money. I played this game all the time when I am trying to pass the time without being bored.
B001NLL93W|5.0|In one word : WAW!<br /><br />City of Glass finally gave me some answers so my questions, doubts and guesses about the story untill now. I almost guessed right but I'm really happy how the storylines turned out in this book.<br />That's about all I can say without spoilers.<br /><br />Up to book 4!
B00846REIS|4.0|This book is definitely a good one to read after 50 Shades Trilogy. It also is a book i can read again & again. Definitely kept my interest.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|Rock of ages is my favorite broadway musical. So when i heard there was a movie coming out i was really excited. especially bc i had seen Mamma Mia on broadway and the movie version was excellent and spot on! when i finally got to the movies to see the rock of ages film, i have to say i was a little bit underwhelmed. the most annoying part to me was that they cut out about 9 or so songs from the movie that were originally in the play? i found that to be very weird since a movie can be as long as u need it to be. i also was a bit annoyed at how much they focused on Tom Cruise's character in this film. in the play he was a minor role, not even having that many lines and only 2 songs. in this movie they make him out to be kind of the main character. they also changed a couple details from the storyline, and changed characters. i'm assuming to give Tom Cruise more screen time. anyway, as for the movie itself it was pretty good. if you haven't seen the play, and you love musicals you would probably love this movie because they did a great job, but if you saw the play, you will be a little bit dissapointed. if you are planning on seeing the play, trust me, see that before you see the movie, bc otherwise it will ruin the fun of the play for you. good luck!
B0084I9QIW|5.0|My only question is, why would they take so long to release some so brilliant? Growing up listening to MJ, the Bad era was and still by far my favorite and ever since I watched his Bucharest concert when it first aired I always wondered if we would see any older concerts at all. All I can say that it's a shame they kept this locked up for so long, but now that we have it all I can say now is FINALLY!<br /><br />I am very happy with this release. I feel this performance exceeded that of the Dangerous concert. The entire focus was MJ and the band and if there was anything that defined the art of music and performance this is it. MJ performed songs in this concert that he has not performed since like \\"This Place Hotel\\", \\"Dirty Diana\\", \\"Rock With You\\". Plus, we still get the good stuff like, \\"Beat It\\", \\"Billie jean\\", etc. You see MJ was having fun in this concertas he smiled a lot more and was very energetic. Every performance was high energy. MJ is a prime example of being one with music. Also the band gets some time to shine as they have a little jam session in mid-show which I think was pretty cool.<br /><br />I see many people complained about the video qulaity. Well we get what we can get. Besides, this was ripped from the original VHS recordings so the footage can only be restored so much. Considering what we have in this release it's really not bad. I just think many of us have been spoiled with HD we expect everything in HD. This is a good release so don't let that get you down. It's worth it.<br /><br />Now, I'm wondering when we will get anything from the Victory Tour.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game is a great time killer! Unlike the real game you don't lose all your money! Maybe when the circus comes to town I'll try the real one again..
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Possibly the best super hero movie Marvel has produced so far. I could just end the review right here, but I won't. Prime shipped on time on release day and came with 2 discs as described (BluRay & DVD). It also comes with a redeem code for a free Avengers poster and digital comic. However, there is a setback with that. S/H 3.95. Clearly optional, but I'm just glad I got the movie.<br /><br />Four years in the making that lead to this: Marvel's The Avengers. Six extraordinary people are called together to stop a global catastrophe. What's not to like about this already?<br /><br />Everyone has already said all the great stuff about it so I'm not going to continue beating a dead horse. Short break down.<br /><br />Overall, the film has a great story that's been built up for the last 4 years. It has an interesting plot, a great cast of heroes, even greater action, witty humor and it's just overall fun for everyone. Even those who have not read a comic book in their lives. This is Marvel's first step at showing how vast the universe really is. This is the first movie in a very long time that instantly became one of my all time favorites. Just sharing the love.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Really loved the ending! Hope Mr. Dashner continues to turn out more. The whole series left me breathless with every page I turned...
B009GEOLM4|4.0|Sure, it's a cartoon..... but it gives you a look at a fairly grizzled, battle torn, and aged Bruce Wayne. With all the moves, gadgets, and dry whit you would expect from Bruce Wayne and company, this is a solid film that is worth checking out.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this game is awesome I mean at first you will not get it but then it will be easy peasy!!!
B007UXSPK2|5.0|I'm not a big fan of Tom Cruise and I haven't even seen any of the other Mission Impossible's but this one was great! Jeremy Renner did a great job!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I don‘t usually write reviews but absolutely loved this book.  I am looking forward to  future books on these same characters.
B000VIK8D0|4.0|A little drawn out, but still an awesome movie. Dennis Quaid is really good as Doc Holliday!!! I think it is actually better than Tombstone.
B0087HT36U|4.0|fun game lots of puzzles very addictive I really enjoy playing this game and so do my six and three year old kids

I haven't had much time to look at it myself, but she's been going crazy pointing out constellations and stars in the sky every time we're outside at night. When i flipped through it i was impressed at the quality and clarity of the star charts, they remind me of the charts in technical reference manuals. Very satisfied.
B000FCKC4C|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  This book made me feel emotions of sadness, my heart rate elevated in parts of it, and kept me interested in what was going to happen next.
B008XJM6NY|4.0|Uno's a really fast-paced, fun album, but it's not as epic or (in my opinion) well-written as 21st Century Breakdown. Also, at less than 45 minutes, the good times are over almost before they begin.<br />Also, the quality of the paper for the Duluxe Edition box is pretty low.
B00018D3RI|5.0|It was a great season.  I really enjoy Starsky and Hutch.  I love the episodes.  This is something baby boomers should watch it.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|The only things that were good about this film are the visuals, and Michael Fassbender who honestly is the only actor in this film worth talking about, if the rest of the film was as incredible as Fassbenders performance then this movie would have been an absolute masterpiece. What killed this film was the troubled script and poor performances by several key actors. There are a lot of great ideas represented in this movie, but unfortunately a lot of bad ideas too.
B004UID2LC|1.0|When i first downloaded it it worked fine, now it no longer allows me to save videos to my phone memory. Now if it doesn't work than why have it? DELETED IT!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I enjoyed the trilogy, however I found that it just ended, wondering will there be more - will Christian Grey become the next Harry Poter.
B009GEAWOU|5.0|Love this show, it gets better every season!! Hope its not the last season. So glad its avalible instantly!! I would recommend it to any and everyone!!
B00000GAIW|5.0|Though I discovered Jethro Tull's music at the age of thirteen during a student music concert that played Thick as a Brick, it was only at seventeen that I found out that this group was extremely popular, that their album Aqualung is one of their biggest best-seller, and has been recognized as a classic for Rock and Roll music. Though I believe it is much more experimental than traditional rock since it uses various types of melodies, instruments and rhythms to express its main thematic which is God and religion. Something that I did get to grasp during the song Cross-Eyed Mary.<br /><br />It is a good thing that this group has the decency of releasing the lyrics of their songs for as their songs have deeper menaging than what you could grasp on the first listening, allowing us to read them can make us grasp other questions that the album raises. Especially when, in the case of my favorite song Wind Up,they criticize religious figures who use God's Word as a way to damn people who disagree with what they say.<br /><br />I applaud Jethro Tull for having the guts to discuss the exploitation of religion and am happy to have, among my favourite tracks, Cross-Eyed Mary, a song that was used by Lars von Trier's Breaking the Waves - a movie that also criticizes how religious elders use God's Words to damn people to hell instead of helping them - Wond'ring Aloud, Hymn 43, and the melancholic Slipstream which, even though it is only thirty seconds long, keeps moving me up to my soul with its ending melody and last words.
