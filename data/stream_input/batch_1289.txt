B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a fun version of the game.  Easy to figure out.  It's also possible to win on random deal.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Great gift idea for young people.  My younger cousins and neighbors love her; great stocking stuffer too. Great voice, courageous young kid too.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great game for the whole family.  My six year old daughter loves it just as much as me.  I could play it daily.

B001GF7WRW|4.0|These completely wrap around my ears. Padding is OK but I've seen better. Very light, but they seem sturdy even though almost impossibly light.<br /><br />Bass is not crazy loud which is good I think. If you are using this to play games or watch Movies, excessive base would wear down your ears after a while. These thankfully are very balanced and don't have the feel of excessive base.<br /><br />Long audio cable. I like the product overall. Only gave 4 stars because sound quality did not blow my mind, but still very good and comfortable.<br /><br />If your a bass head, these probably aren't for you.

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I am so happy to hear that you openly support Ron Paul, because as we all know the media attacks people who support him and his message of a limited government that follows that Constitution. I listened to some of your songs when I heard about you, and I think you have a beautiful voice. Keep on singing and don't let anyone control how you think and feel about anything. You are in control of your mind. Don't stop fighting the fight for freedom!   You go girl!
0440246016|5.0|I was recently turned on to Lee Child by a friend who is an avid reader. I was skeptical about reading a \\"series,\\" but I've been pleasantly surprised from the start. I began with \\"Die Trying\\" and am currently on my fourth Reacher novel. I'd like to say that it's my guilty pleasure, but the truth is there is nothing about this author's writing style that gives the reader anything to be ashamed of. Jack Reacher is a believable action-hero; self-contained, relying solely on his wits and skills that have been honed to perfection over the course of his life. I love how with each new story, we pick up Jack with the shirt on his back and maybe a few dollars to his name. The character is quirky but completely believable; the plots are dynamic and full of surprises; and I've never found myself bored with Jack or the trouble that he can't seem to steer clear of. After the first book, I made myself switch genres so that I wouldn't get become a Lee Child junkie, but I find myself hankering for another Reacher novel. They are so entertaining, stimulating and satisfying. I'm glad it took me so long to discover this writer, for now I have plenty of unread books to look forward to. But I must say, I find it hard to imagine them being any better than \\"Bad Luck and Trouble.\\" It is definitely my favorite so far.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Thank you for going against the industry-grain and going with who and what you believe in for 2012!  You are not alone and we're 100% behind you.

B004WR125O|5.0|I had this up and running on my onkyo receiver very quickly.  I used the manual mode whereby you choose the network using the up/down arrow, then type the password using by selecting letters from an alphabet displayed on the screen.  An HDMI cable goes to the TV, so you can see menus for choosing from a variety of internet radio options.  Turns out I didn't need to buy this because the receiver had an ethernet jack and it is right next to the network hub.  Still saves one cable.

0156012197|5.0|The Little Prince is my choice for you- a gift of laughter and recognition of soul's work, and how we touch one another- always. The unexpected (usually not part of the life we planned for ourselves) appears. We grapple with the new entity and our \\"place\\", and sometimes our perception is wrong, but luckily there are others who are generous in their time and knowledge. They encourage us. And, we lose our guides (how we adore them), and we gain clarity (not as we would of planned for), but nonetheless our gifts multiply.<br /><br />1. Hardship- the flower- is ours. It is of value, but usually others have to illuminate oneself to realizing our love was freely given love (and the accompanying cherishing behaviors) will never be \\"in vain.\\"<br /><br />2. Clarity of Purpose-the blond curled boy-is ours to emulate, but never to incorporate. If we find a value, a memory, a time in our lives that taught us, and we grew that growth was due to Clarity of Purpose, and usually comes with great force of love- for life and life's purpose and it is our LOVE-and our Expressions of Love that conditions us for upcoming moments of Clarity of Purpose.<br /><br />I've reread these pages without count. A Southern Baptist looking for meaning in a wee funny  book filled with darling illustrations. I hope I can share some of that meaning that I found with you. It's a short book and each word is syntactically primed. Nothing extra is given. It is full of interaction- just as life is.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|Excellent app for quick notes or lists. I create my grocery list each week using the checklist feature. It eliminates the need for bulky paper &amp; pen lists that I usually forget in the car anyway! I highly recommend.
1455510319|5.0|I am a huge fan of Michael Connelly and his Lincoln Lawyer series. I fell in love with the character Mickey Haller after reading the Lincoln Lawyer, and my love for Mick has only grown. I was admittedly a bit hesitant about reading 'The Fifth Witness' due to the fact that unlike Connelly's prior Lincoln Lawyer novels, his latest work has not received anywhere near the usual acclaim as its predecessors have on the Amazon.com user reviews. However, upon finishing this latest addition in the book series about everyone's favorite Defense Attorney, I found myself feeling absolutely dumbfounded as to how so many users could have written such negative reviews about this novel. It is filled with wonderful plot twists and curve-balls that will leave you in plenty of WTF? moments. My only criticism of the novel - if you can even call it a criticism - is that unlike virtually every other work by Michael Connelly, the Fifth Witness does start off a bit slow compared to the rest of Connelly's novels. That being said, a slow start is hardly a legitimate reason for scrutiny, and does nothing to affect the overall quality and success of the novel. The Fifth Witness is not only a marvelous addition to an already wonderful series, but it is in fact the best Lincoln Lawyer novel yet! I highly recommend it!
B0050CQY1W|5.0|I am a huge music lover and look forward to buying good music all the time and folks, this right here is some good music. I love Beyonce anyways and think she is an excellent singer/performer so I was ready for 4!<br />This is her best album to date in my opinion. It's a 360 from her debut album, Dangerously InLove, but that's because she has grown as an artist and is evolving in other genres of music, and I respect that. People say that Beyonce is overated or her time is up now, grow up! Do u want to stay in the same place you're in for the rest of your life? Well, neither does she and that's why she does what she does. I bought both the standard and the deluxe the day it came out and here's what I think. Wanna hear it? Here it go:<br /><br />ALBUM COVER: Love the cover with the exception of them covering her name. I think her name should be more open but other than that, it's cool!<br /><br />1+1: Her best ballad song thus far. Love it!<br /><br />I CARE: More of a Pop song and Beyonce delivers on this track with her vocals, especially towards the end. Love it!<br /><br />I MISS YOU: A soft, pure song where Beyonce becomes vulnerable as she is painfully honest about missing that person you just can't let go of.<br /><br />BEST THING I NEVER HAD: A cool track that everyone who has an ex can relate to.<br /><br />PARTY: A track to play when you wanna get into the party groove. Love the harmonies!<br /><br />RATHER DIE YOUNG: An emotional track that pulls you right in and will have you singing along to the smooth beat.<br /><br />START OVER: Love the way Beyonce sings this song. It's all feeling and emotion.<br /><br />LOVE ON TOP: Beyonce gets down on this song as she modulates towards the end. Definitely a track to snap your fingers to!<br /><br />COUNTDOWN: A fun, hip song that has you counting down with the Queen Bey!<br /><br />END OF TIME: Love this song with it's feel of pure bliss!<br /><br />I WAS HERE: Beyonce mastered this song with her vocals, low and high. This song is definitely for the books!<br /><br />RUN THE WORLD (GIRLS): My favorite track off the whole album. Didn't do too well as her first single but I looooooove this song.<br /><br />Folks, it's Beyonce. Enough said! GO GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!l as her first single but I looooooove this song.   Folks, it's Beyonce. Enough said! GO GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Purchased this CD from here and the iTunes session on iTunes. Thanks Kelly for holding your ground. Listening to the CD now. Not normally my music, but someone that takes a stand like this for Dr. Paul deserves my $12 in my opinion.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I first saw this movie on TV.  When I realized it was out on DVD I had to buy it.  This movie touched my heart! The power of an animal's love is beyond measure.  I wish people had the kind of love and devotion to each other that this dog had for his owner!  This is a wonderful story.  You won't be disappointed.
0937381888|5.0|Author is very detailed and thorough in explaining ALL of the aspects of home brewing.  I brewed my first batch using the recipe he gave in the first chapter and it turned out excellent!  Favorite features:  - Down and dirty crash course in first chapter for those that want to dive right in.  - Lists EVERYTHING you will possibly need to get and need to know to get started...and then some.  - Gets deep into the science of brewing so the reader understands how this all works  - Witty, makes it an easy read  One minor complaint.  I thought that the chapters were a little out of order.  I found myself wishing that chapters 7,9, and 11 followed chapter 1 as they are important chapters for the \\"how to\\" part.
B00457WZEI|5.0|This was a quick easy enjoyable read.  I loved that the book is written from the horses perspective.  I will be sharing this book with my kids also.  Enjoyable for adults and children.

I really got into the plot but unfortunately the plane was getting ready to land and I lost the last 15 minutes of the movie.Thanks to Amazon, I was able to purchase it and watch the whole movie. This will be one of many other purchases I will make from Amazon. Thanks again, the movie was great.
B000JMKNJ2|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book so much! The plot is different and the start was a bit confusing but it gets clearer and more exciting as the story progresses. I haven't read any book like this: fast paced, intriguing ang thoroughly enjoyable. I have to read the whole series!

B003Y5H4SO|3.0|Maybe it is because I am from Philadelphia, and the beginning of the movie does show a great \\"devil's eye\\" view of the city.  Although I think they add an extra skyscraper to the downtown, or it was built after I left.  Or maybe I just like the premise.  But I love this movie.  The acting stinks, the plot is ridiculous, they got to save lots of money by putting five actors in a small space for most of the movie - no extra money for scenery.  The main detective is somewhat compelling - the movie came across as a fight for his soul, after he went through a traumatic experience which could have caused him to fall into a hole of cynicism and self-pity.  You don't know which way he is going to go until the end of the movie.  But it is handled is such a pedestrian, hamfisted way that it is hard to care.  But he does better than his fellow actors in getting to the point of the movie.  The ending is so predictable.  Despite all of these strikes against it - I found this movie entertaining.  I have seen it two or three times and I still cannot explain why.  But I will say - I think it is worth a look - you may disagree with me, but you should try it out.  Especially if you are from Philly.

0446585025|5.0|This book was so fun to read! I was so tempted to just sit all day and read the book. Ellen is veryyy fun and this book was definitely worth the buy. Normally I just borrow books at the library, but the funny and witty comments, as well as insightful reactions, make this book worth a second read.
B004SGWYW4|5.0|Awesome show.  While there may be a little too much emphasis on boobs and underwear for my liking, there are enough action-packed and serious scenes to help balance that minor flaw out.  The dialogue in this dub is particularly good.  They're not afraid to use profanity (when it's fitting, of course) and they really make it make sense to an English audience.  A really great buy.  I'd recommend it to any anime fan above the age of 18 :)
B004G600A4|5.0|I'll admit, when I first heard that Disney's next fairy-tale adaptation would be all CGI and not cell animation, I was very disappointed (I am over 30). I felt wistful for those days of good old-fashioned hand-drawn/painted animation and sad that that chapter of movies was coming to an end.  But let me tell, taking my daughter to Tangled, I was amazed, riveted, entertained. I watched it with the same wide-eyedness as my five-year-old daughter. I laughed, I cried, and I have NEVER cried during an animated film as an adult! (I won't spoil it, but it was towards the end and had something to do with Rapunzel and her real mother. I guess being a mom myself now, mother-daughter stuff always pulls at my heartstrings :) Finally, it has taken Disney nearly 20 years to bring back that Disney magic that I have not seen since Beauty and the Beast and Aladdin. Sure, some elements are a bit derivative of past Disney films, but so what? If it works, it works. Tangled has it all- humor, romance, adventure, an engaging story, a charming (and funny) hero, an AMAZING duet that will give you the goosebumps, and of course a great heroine who in my opinion is the best Disney heroine to date. Not to mention, visually it is just utterly beautiful. The lantern scene is one of the most moving, breathtaking scenes in American movies, PERIOD, animated or not. I don't want to hype it up too much for those who haven't seen it, but I just can't help it. I loved it. It is simply magical.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|great practice for chess, if u get better u can change the difficulty for more work. its excellent since its free and also its easier to study chess patterns. its also addicting and fun and another form to play chess with a friend.

B004ZJZPXY|5.0|This is a great comedy. It has that fun quirky indie feel to it with none of the low budget drippy music let down. Simon Pegg plays Nicholas Angel. Angel is London's greatest policeman. In fact he is too good and makes the rest of the force look bad. They promote him and railroad him out to Sanford, a village which constantly wins \\"Village of the Year\\" awards. They have a low crime rate, primarily because the police don't arrest anyone, a British version of Mayberry. This puts Angel at odds with everyone in town, whom remain polite as he seemingly busts everyone in the peaceful village. The comedy is greater good. While on duty and sitting in a pub with fellow policemen, they talk about firearms.<br /><br />Andie: \\"Everyone in town and their mum owns a gun.\\"<br />Angel: \\"Such as who?\\"<br />Andie: \\"Farmers own guns.\\"<br />Angel: \\"And who else?\\"<br />Andie: \\"And their mums.\\"<br /><br />Nick Frost plays PC Danny Butterman who becomes Angel's sidekick. He loves police movies and admires Angel. Together they become a crime fighting duo in a village that has a secret.<br /><br />F-bomb, no sex, fake nudity. some blood and gore.
0439023513|5.0|It was scary and it was real. Seeing Katniss so weak and so hollow made me die a little inside. No one was expecting the real aftermath of a deadly war between Panem and the Capitol. We all thought Mockingjay was going to be a logical love story with a slight backdrop of war to fill in the cracks. Boy were we wrong. Katniss must fight for Peeta, because Peeta has the inability to fight for her anymore. I was filled with tears throughout nearly the whole book. I became awar of the the realism of The Hunger Games Trilogy. War breaks you down. It shatters you until you are hollow and emaciated. It takes away everything you love and everything that you have ever believed in. Mockingjay wasn't just about a boy and girl falling in love and overcoming a government that wants nothing but death. It is about the actuality of a war and the bloody battles that could kill a sister or destroy the mind of a lover. After reading Mockingjay, I felt a deep sense of catharsis. Out of all the brutally honest death and sorrow, there was still a twisted happy ending. Through the mental hijacking and the physically mental hollowness, Katniss and Peeta end up together. Even with former shells of themselves, both entwined with the aftermath of war, they found love in a hopeless place. They found love in a world where death was at your doorstep, war was the only solution to problems, and even rebel rulers lost sight of power. It truly was the greatest way to end the Hunger Games Trilogy. Be aware this story is not for a reader who buys into happy endings. Sometimes happiness isn't the way to go. Sometimes what everybody needs is a strong dose of reality.

0670022950|5.0|Dr. Steven Pinker's  \\"The Better Angels...\\" provides an absorbing chronicle of violence (the good, the bad, and the ugly) throughout history, documents data that supports his thesis that violence has declined drastically over the past centuries (especially since World War II), and finally provides us with a recipe (what works and what doesn't work) for violence to continue its decline.<br /><br />Chapter 8, 9, and 10 provide us with an absorbing look into the inner workings of the mind that can lead to violent actions and reactions. Dr. Pinker's insightful analysis provide us with the tools to help fight the persistent incidents of violence that plague certain parts of our planet.<br /><br />After dragging the reader (reluctantly for me) through the gruesome history of violence in all its nasty, inhumane forms, Dr. Pinker carefully documents his reasons for the significant decline of violence between and inside countries over the last centuries.<br /><br />The book gives us a chance to step back and view the historical trends in a whole new way, mixing sociology, biology, and history together in a fascinating way. Dr. Pinker provides us with convincing evidence based on a thorough review of relevant studies and historical datasets. He allows readers to make up their own minds about the evidence and theories presented. He explodes many myths and really forces the reader to think and contemplate the significance of what his is trying to demonstrate.<br /><br />I have gained a new insight about many of the anti-violence trends that have occurred during my lifetime. I underestimated the positive impact of the peace-keeping forces, the importance of the UN, and peaceful demonstrations, among others. Also, Dr. Pinker's insights brought new meaning to my rereading of \\"Old Yeller\\" by Fred Gipson. As I start \\"Independence\\" by John Ferling, I understand better the difficult choices made by Great Britain and the American colonies as war approached.<br /><br />Other reviewers have summarized the book well (Eskildson, Nov 7, 2011 and Gintis, Dec 3, 2011). I only wish to emphasize what I consider the most relevant points, theories and perspective that Dr. Pinker presents.<br />The decline in violence can be attributed to:<br /><br />1. The Leviathan - a government monopoly on force to protect its citizens from themselves.<br /><br />2. International Commerce - an exchange of benefits can turn zero-sum warfare (where nobody really wins) into positive-sum mutual profit.<br /><br />3. Feminization - A more feminized world is a more peaceful one.<br /><br />4. Expanding circle of sympathy toward the feelings of others outside the family.<br /><br />5. The Escalator of Reason - Literacy, cosmopolitanism and education. People's reasoning abilities have steadily increased over time which have resulted in more non-violent solutions to conflict.<br /><br />6. The Spread and Evolution of Democracy - democracy by design allows the citizens to resolve their disputes in a non-violent way.<br /><br />I purchased the hard cover version for the details of the graphs. (I wish they would provide a spreadsheet file of the graphs so we could study and manipulate the raw data). The book was slow reading for me since the writing often made me stop to think over each enlightening analysis and theory about the underlying causes of violence and the reasons for its decline.<br /><br />As an American expatriate living in Mexico for the last 30 years, I especially treasured the insights into why outbreaks of intra-country violence continue in many parts of the world.

The book is well-researched and detailed, but it reads more like a thrilling novel than a dense finance book. Mallaby makes you feel as if you are in the room with the great titans of hedge funds, showing both their strengths and their glaring weaknesses, proving they are indeed men, not gods. I could not put the book down.   I highly recommend this book to everyone and it is very accessible to those who are not finance experts. I was a student that was interested in going to the field of investing before reading this book, but after reading it, I am fairly certain that the world of hedge funds is where I want to be.

B000ATQYT2|5.0|I've watched just about all the adaptations of \\"A Christmas Carol\\" that I could find, and this is my all-time favorite. Kudos to Michael Caine, as a sinister Scrooge, and all The Muppets for a hysterical holiday classic.

B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Thank you for supporting Ron Paul!!! You are one of the few brave people in Hollywood and the Music world to stand up against the status quo. I have always loved your music but not much about buying CD or downloading music but this is a great cause to support those willing to stand on the side of liberty. As a mom, Air Force Veteran, and wife to an Active duty Airman, I thank you. Stand strong.

B00319ECGU|5.0|I doubt I can add a meaningful review to what has already been written about the 5 Dirty Harry movies contained in this pack.  Clearly these film are forever engraved in our pop culture and this bluray collection (especially given the low price it reaches regularly) is a bargain-hunter's dream.  The films are \\"seen\\" at various aspect ratios (1.78:1 for Dirty Harry, and about 2.35:1 for the rest).  There is \\"grain\\" visible in all of them, but this is how they looked when projected.  The sound track is mostly Left-Center-Right dominated, with the occasional well placed surround effect, but this is exactly as these movies were heard in the theaters. And (at least for Magnum Force for which I have the DVD to compare) the look is much better (cleaner) than the DVD.  The \\"extra\\" commentaries in each film are an added bonus.  For Eastwood (and Dirty Harry fans) this bluray set is highly recommended.
B0063IH60K|4.0|the controls are great - just tapping a card sends it to the most logical place.  kind of weird that it requires an Internet connection for dealing a winnable hand

B002L5GQGY|5.0|I saw the Joe Bonamassa concert--Live From the Royal Albert Hall--first on Public Television. I was guite impressed by Joe's excellent guitar skills and guitar playing ability. Then I bought the DVD. I really like this DVD because it just focuses on Joe's great guitar playing. Joe does not have a big light show, and does not make this concert into a big extravaganza production. The crowd at the Royal Albert Hall came to see a great guitarist play, and that is exactly what you get when you watch this DVD. I go back to the 60's when I started to listen to rock and roll, and I have seen most of the great guitarists in concert. Joe is one of the best guitarist's of this era, and this is evident when you watch this DVD. This DVD is outstanding guitar music art.
B005I6EU7U|4.0|This is a wonderful cover. I love the design and the case is very sturdy. The only complaint is when reading with the kindle, there really isn't anything to do with the cover flap. It would be nice if you could fold it back and hold it there with a strap.
B00006JMQG|5.0|This film is a paradox in more ways than one. It is famous as the one which started the \\"Gothic horror\\" film genre, but it is rarely seen in theaters.  Not that silent films are daily fair at the cineplex, but even among the silent film circuit this film is rarely seen. I systematically go \\"hunting\\" for silent film showings but over the last 15 years I have never succeeded in seeing this film on this side of the Atlantic.  Now it is in my rec room and it is indeed a great pleasure to see.  Mind you, this is a DVD of a restored 1919 film (can you say D.W. Griffith?) so keep your expectations for picture quality to a level reasonable.  That said, modulo the few non-uniformities in tint/coloring during the first few scenes in the film what you do see is amazing.  And the \\"story\\" with its twists and turns is far more intriguing than what one might expect. Highly recommended.
0545265355|5.0|This was an excellent buy. This series is absolutely one you cannot put down. I would highly recommend it for anyone with a love of easy-to-read, richly plotted fiction.

B005ZUR724|1.0|so the game has had an update and now it will not allow me to play on my kindle fire.  ok I say things will get fixed, right!  well I have contacted amazon and they are very willing to help but when I contacted gameloft they have still yet to be of any assistance.  I would figure if it was my game that I had made I would try to let my loyal customers know what is going on.  I had just paid for a six month subscription when this happened, is gameloft gonna do something about this or are they gonna be stupid?  all I know is the game is a great game and for.gameloft to act this is very childish they should at least let us know what's going on.  I have experienced some bad customer service but this is by far the worst I have experienced.  thank you gameloft.

B005K2YXHO|1.0|The picture shows that under the flap that keeps it closed is 2 velcro strips. The ACTUAL product that was shipped has 2 magnets. I've heard magnets cause problems with the Kindle so I avoided buying a case with magnets. So unfortunately what they sell is not what they advertise. I have to return this and get a completely different case because now I don't trust what I would get from this company.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book. It really was (as a friend described) like 1984/Fahrenheit 451 but written for teenagers. It was compelling and I enjoyed it, however there were several loose ends that I would have liked to see tied up.
B0065GFXXM|4.0|this CD gives the listener the broad range of talent Drake has.  This content seems to polarized one minute its smooth songs for the ladies and next he wants to validate his presence in the hip hop industry. Its great album and if you are into hiphop you like this album

0393338827|5.0|This book is either going to interest you or it's not. It chronicles the financial crisis of 2007-2008, explaining the subprime mortgage markets that drove the economy into recession. In my opinion, it's very technical. Most of the vocabulary and some of the concepts will be brand new to the reader. When writing this review, I realized it's hard to talk about the subject because much has to be explained initially. Here's my best shot:<br /><br />A subprime mortgage is one that is less likely to be repaid by the borrower. These subprime mortgages were packaged together into bonds for large investors. For example, an individual subprime mortgage could be rated triple B, but when a group of them were packaged together they were rated triple A (same as a U.S. Treasury bond). Investors wanted more of this safe investment, so more subprime mortgage loans were giving out to less and less deserving borrowers. Borrowers were offered teaser rates: low interest rates for the first 2 years then it would jump up. And little or no documentation was required, credit scores were glanced over, there were no down payments. Basically loans were given to people who had no chance of repaying once the interest rate jumped up.<br /><br />No one really questioned - or understood - what was in these bond packages. How likely were they to default? What if house values stopped increasing? How could a strawberry picker earning $14,000 a year pay off a $725,000 mortgage? Who would even give a loan for that?<br /><br />I've tried to simplify the root of the problem. But truthfully, it's way more complicated. Products were created that held a 100 of these subprime mortgage bonds. Things got so big and out of control way too fast. Companies earned millions of dollars and wanted more. This was all too good to be true and turned into a vicious, self-destroying cycle. You wonder how everyone could be so ignorant and not question what was going on. The few people who dug into the prospectuses and questioned others realized the whole system was going to blow up. They made hundreds of millions of dollars, some even made billions.<br /><br />Out of all the books I've read this year, this was the hardest to read. There is so much new information that I found myself re-reading page after page. And I was reading it very slowly. You have to in order to take it all in. I don't mean any of this as criticism; I think it's important to read the book slowly in order to understand it. The book contains a lot of facts and information. For the most part, Michael Lewis leaves out his opinions until the end. From other stuff I've read or seen, I think The Big Short provides the best explanation of the crisis. I am not saying this is the only thing one should read, but it offers a great starting point to understanding the basics. After reading The Big Short, you ask yourself how did they not see this coming?le system was going to blow up. They made hundreds of millions of dollars, some even made billions.

B0052VUNHC|2.0|Okay so i picked this up wanting a light read and first few chapters i liked and then when i thought i was coming to a close i checked where i was on my kindle and was only at 20%. Why the hell is this book so long? It should have stopped at long time ago. First let me start with either stay or F-ing go, Abby was seriously pissing me off with Travis. I like him but i hate him...but i like him. No wonder the dude is pissed. While Travis turns into a completely different person from lady killer to whipped pup with some serious codependent ways that remind me of the twilight series, not a healthy relationship. I felt like it was supper dragged out as to whether she could just put all their problems to the side and be together but at that point I just didnt care anymore.Im not a big fan of Abby, i thought some of her choices where stupid. It wasnt a bad book but just a little too much drama and angst for me, or more then i was expecting anyways.
B004EPZ07U|4.0|I was tempted to buy this when it first came out but because it received mixed reviews I decided to save my money.

1451648537|4.0|In case you couldn't guess by the title, this is the biography of Steve Jobs. He was a co-founder of Apple, created the first truly personal computer (with graphical interfaces, the mouse, fonts, and colors), started Pixar (Toy Story, Finding Nemo, Monsters, Inc.), and more recently worked on the iPod, iTunes, the iPhone, and the iPad. Steve Jobs died at the young age of 56 this past October, and the biography was released a few weeks after.<br /><br />It's best to know a little background on Walter Isaacson. He has written the biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Albert Einstein. I actually read half of the Einstein biography but it was too burdensome for me to finish. Steve Jobs is just as detailed and lengthy (571 pages). Every aspect of his life is covered - work, family, religion, diets, relationships. The smallest details and conversations are included. Given all of this, it took me over two weeks to finish this book.<br /><br />What Steve jobs accomplished is unfathomable. Besides being one of the first to bring computers to the world, he has revolutionized so many industries: animated movies, music, phones, books, newspapers, retail stores. (Yes, retail stores. Consider this: on average, each of the 326 Apple stores earned $34 million in 2010. The store in New York earned more money per square foot than any store in the world, and it earns more money than any store in New York City - Saks, Bloomingdale's, Macy's, all of them.) His philosophy was people didn't know what they wanted: if Henry Ford asked people what they wanted, they would have said a faster horse, not a car. Often quoted in the book is Wayne Gretzky, who said \\"skate where the puck was going, not where it's been.\\" It's easy to describe him as a genius after reading the book, and history will place him with Thomas Edison and Henry Ford for all the he has contributed.<br /><br />Steve Jobs can apply to many people. It's not very technical, but it will certainly entertain those amused by computers and technology. There are a lot of management lessons, some that should be followed, some that should never be repeated. There are deep questions posed, such as open-sourced or closed-sourced, whether it's good or bad to have end-to-end control. Younger readers who are energized to begin their own company will enjoy hearing the initial struggles that were overcome.ot of management lessons, some that should be followed, some that should never be repeated.

076790592X|3.0|My guess is most people have heard of Tuesdays with Morrie. It's what I would describe as a recent classic. Morrie Schwartz was a professor at Brandeis University who was beloved by many students. As he grew older, he was diagnosed with ALS and forced to retire as his body began to shut down. An article about him in the Boston Globe prompted NBC Nightline to interview him. Mitch Albom, one of his favorite former students, saw him on television and reached out.<br /><br />Mitch decides to take a break from sports reporting to visit Morrie. Their relationship is rekindled and Mitch visits again. They continue to meet on Tuesdays. Each week they discuss something different such as marriage, death, family, forgiveness, etc. Morrie has so much to share, Mitch has so much to learn, but there is little time left.<br /><br />Tuesdays with Morrie is straightforward with plenty of life lessons that reads quickly. The layout of the book is smart - it's laid out like a professor would do, with a syllabus and lessons. I will say that this is not my favorite Mitch Albom book, but I still think it is very good. He is near the top of the list of my favorite authors. His other books include The Five People You Meet in Heaven and Have a Little Faith (maybe I will feature a review on them in the future).

1416511946|4.0|Overall, a good book. I have a lot of respect for the author as an artist and a person in recovery. I read this book because I am in recovery myself, although fairly new at it, and read a review that said it would deter anyone from ever wanting to use drugs and that it was an accurate description of addiction. I'm not bashing Sixx here, but there are two thoughts that I would consider before choosing this reading material. One, it is not a totally accurate picture of real-world addiction, simply in the fact that celebs can get away with alot more than other people with fewer consequences. I have seen so many lives devistated far more by less excess substance abuse, because we are addicts in normal life, trying to survive. There is not just the anguish of withdrawal and obsession, which he mentions, but in addition, there can be the loss of basic necesities, our freedom, homes, and our precious children, not to mention the horrible guilt that we live with every day over the chaos and pain that we have caused. Second, it may be helpful for loved ones of addicts to understand the mental process of addiction, which is the same, celeb or not, but I would not recommend it to anyone in recovery. In our altered mental processes, despite the sometimes repulsive nature of the descriptions Nikki gives, just focusing on drugs and such detailed descriptions may be a trigger for some, especially ones such as myself who aren't detered by much of anything, unfortunately. So the long and short of it is, there are many differences between this and addiction in the real world, but the sickness is still the same in our hearts and minds. I would handle this one with care, and probably not give it to young people or people in recovery.

B006O5Y0SS|4.0|A charming stroll through a magnificent city and a wonderful age of larger than life personalities.  Thoroughly enjoyed.  However, definitely not for every taste.  You don't have to have been a literary major to enjoy, but if you're moderately well-read you'll certainly have added appreciation for how the film brings life to its characters.  I thought Owen Wilson was nicely matched to the material and plays his character wonderfully.  But again, if you're into shootouts, or car chases, or Ninjas, this is probably not your treat.  Just a delightful fantasy told with wit and grace.

An implausible plot is made believable through the author's unique narrative style and his deep, multi-layered characterizations.  Humor and heartbreak, love and disgust, humanity and horror, intricately woven into a page turner!
B000EQ5SRK|4.0|Saw this movie years ago and could not find it anywhere other than Amazon.com.  It is a thriller but should be for adults only due to sexual content.

The movie was enjoyable, Ryan Reynolds is so adorable! What female wouldn't want to watch him. It's a Super-Hero movie, it's supposed to be \\"cheesy\\"! Glad I have added it to my video library!
B001UV4XJ2|4.0|The Blu-Ray transfer of the film is truly a great experience visually. The darks are sustained and the color scheme is really protected and done justice by the Blu-Ray. If you haven't heard, the Ultra-Violet digital copy is sort of a scam and truly is a big negative about this package, as you have to subscribe a service and the digital copy actually expires after a year. But the extra DVD is a plus considering that the price is only a few dollars more than the single-disc Blu-Ray package.
1451648537|4.0|I enjoyed reading the book, and there were times when I couldn't put it down, such as the time Steve was ousted from Apple, and when he ousted Gil Amelio years later. I thought the amount of detail was sufficient, although I did spot a couple of details that left me hanging, such as what happened to his travel buddy Daniel Kottke after Steve refused to give him Apple stock.  The biggest disappointment was Steve Jobs, the person. Before reading the book, I (like many people) admired and respected the guy for Apple's innovative creations (especially the iPhone) and for not giving up after being a perennial bridesmaid to Bill Gates/Microsoft/IBM compatibles for so long. But I was caught up in his infamous \\"reality distortion field\\", and had an incomplete picture of him.  While I had heard and read about his temper tantrums and \\"dressing down\\" of people in public, but I never knew he was as egotistical, narcissistic, stubborn, manipulative, excessively rude, and impulsively critical as what I had read in this biography! Did Steve think he was running a boot camp instead of a company? He must've thought the Golden Rule was \\"crap\\", to use one of his favored descriptions. Ever since he, Woz and Ron Wayne created Apple, all of his \\"friends\\" were either people in the I.T. industry (Larry Ellison), former employees of Apple (Andy Hertzfeld, Debi Coleman), current employees of Apple (Jony Ive), people from Pixar (John Lasseter), or people whom he had done business with (e.g. Lee Clow, Rupert Murdoch). He only put value in a person based on his intelligence and talents, and ultimately, what he could do for Apple - for example Woz was a \\"brilliant\\", \\"intelligent\\" guy. But if you didn't have anything to offer to Steve's business ventures, he didn't bother with you. He abandoned his early friendships with Daniel Kottke and Chrisann Brennan, and later on in his life, it seemed that the only friends he had were his wife's, and only one of them was mentioned in the book.  I haven't lost sight of his accomplishments. He really did achieve more than most people in his life, especially from the time he acquired Pixar. He was a skillful negotiator, and there are not many people who could see the beauty in an object the way that Steve could. He is still a fascinating character. But I do feel he could have achieved everything he has achieved without the unconscionable treatment he dished out at everyone around him. I have a more accurate perception of Steve thanks to Isaacson's book, but I have now lost a lot of admiration and respect for him.

Some aspects were glossed over, characters weren't fleshed out and the prose really stood out as not being the original author. I found it really distracting until I got to the middle.<br /><br />I realized I had to step away from my fandom and look at the reality. This book wasn't completed, and someone had to fill in the gaps. That person wasn't Crichton - and didn't know everything he was thinking about - so logically there are going to be some bits that annoy me. I had to stop getting so annoyed and just step back emotionally because at it's best, it was classic Crichton. There was dialogue and action scenes reminiscent of Jurassic Park and I felt so excited about the potential of this story.<br /><br />I'm glad this was published. I wish he had been able to complete the whole thing, but I'm glad they brought on Preston so that we could see the story as a whole. Sure, some bits were unsatisfying, but it was so worth it to get to read more from my favourite author.
B00001OH7O|5.0|I listened to this album 2 times in a row just so I could wrap my head around it. \\"Hunky Dory\\" works almost like a preview or prequel to \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" in that it's lyrical abstractness and it's willingness to explore uncharted musical territory is incredibly similar. Which is a good thing because I can't think of one bad song on this album, maybe one had a minor flaw but this is just about as good as it gets.<br /><br />If you're looking to get a David Bowie album that won't disappoint you, this is definitely one you could choose.<br /><br />If you're wondering what album of his to get first to test the waters, I'd say \\"Ziggy\\" or \\"Heroes\\".<br /><br />This album is definitely a classic.

0061997811|5.0|i was so pleased and amazed  when i got this harry potter film wizardry, the transaction and the shipping was so fast, i ordered it last Dec.17 and i got it yesterday Dec.29, the book is all about the making and producing harry potter 1-8 movies which gives the readers the knowledge on how harry potter films were made
0393330435|4.0|I read this immediately after reading Woz's chapter in Founders At Work. I knew he had something to do with the early days of Apple and was considered to a god in the computer industry.<br /><br />I was really, really surprised by how much I enjoyed the book. It was written by a journalist who condensed multiple conversations and organized it into a narrative. I'm not a technological person, but I really enjoyed Woz's anecdotes.<br /><br />Sometimes it was too techie - particular when talking about the two computers he designed. I didn't feel like there was much that was relevant to my business, or knowledge of computers, but it did make me realize that genius alone isn't enough to accomplish great things. You need a great salesperson.<br /><br />I recommend this if you are interested in Woz, Apple or the early days of tech. I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it that much if not for being on a startup binge.
B001TOD9VI|5.0|This is cinematic artform at it's finest.A great film from Darren.A moving film regarding pro-wrestlers.From the relationship of Mickey Rourke's character with his daughter to the struggles he goes through as a pro-wrestler.It's a highly recommended film!
1451648537|5.0|An rare insightful look into the mind of a true pioneer and a fascinating behind the scenes walk through the last 25 years of the computer business.
B000H4QD1O|5.0|I really enjoyed the cast and writing.  Quite refreshing and fun.  I've watched the entire season 4 times now and still can't get enough.  A must watch if you like westerns and or science fiction.
B005H0IW6W|4.0|This is a nice album with an old-fashioned touch of Christmas.  Whether he tries to or not, Buble comes off sounding eerily like Bing Crosby, a crooning sound the under-50 crowd may not know.  The question is: do they like it?
B000X5SPBI|1.0|I didn't realize until I had thrown out all the packaging that I was not given the last DVD disc.  Instead I was give two of one of the other DVD discs.  Very disappointing.
B000MV8XPG|4.0|Our son was so happy to get this gift Christmas morning. He loves it and is ready to  Start digging. He did pinch his finger twice, trying to figure out how.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I bought this because Kelly Clarkson publicly supported Ron Paul. I will continue to support anyone that is not afraid to question the establishment. Oh, the music is great.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|If you are looking for the most versatile and comprehensive calendar, you can stop looking. Please don't let the price stop you from purchasing this. It almost did me. It is WELL worth the cost. This calendar app does EVERYTHING you would want it to do. REALLY! I have looked and looked for a calendar that does all the things this one does. It does them all and more. You can set up repeat occasions from daily, to weekly, to monthly, annually, every 4 weeks, first Tuesday of every month and on and on. You can set reminders, reminders of the reminders, color code events, I'm telling you your options are endless. You can even reload this app for free when you get a new phone. Can even be used on a Kindle Fire or other electronics. Perhaps the best feature is the support. I have emailed with no fewer than 6 questions as I am learning and within hours (sometimes minutes) I have a response. Support from other companies and organizations have perhaps equaled this one MAYBE, but none has ever been surpassed. I know I sound like I work for the company but I assure you I don't. I have just been pleased beyond my expectations. I use this calendar app continuously for both work and personal scheduling.
B004QK5N5W|1.0|This adaptor doesnt work. Purchased exact model from apple store in the local mall and it wonderfully displays iPad and iPhone 4 video & audio. I suspect there is a circuit board in it which got static zapped somewhere, with this dry winter air.
B005FMZX9Q|5.0|I really like the weight of this watch and it's pretty bulky, which I really like also.  So far, it appears to be high quality and is a really nice looking watch.  Overall, for the price, I am very happy with it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|This movie is amazing. The chemistry between Margaret Hale and John Thornton is amazing. Hale's beliefs and actions are all fairness. Thornton's affections for her are pleasant in a sense that he's always loved her.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Like her other albums, this one has tracks which are less entertaining or less fun to listen to but the majority of them are up to her typical excellent standards.  I do wish that there were more tracks which highlight Clarkson's amazing range and incredibly strong voice but I suspect the producers may have limited that in order to not be seen as falling into a musical rut or too formulaic selection.
0061992860|5.0|This is a good book loaded with valuable info for that \\"just in case\\" cause you really never know. I think it's just the right size, I know others have said it's to small but I think for the amount of info that it contains it's just the right size. The price is quite reasonable for what you get. I am going to get a couple more, to keep in the car and one for an emergency kit. Like the saying goes preparedness favors the bold and it's just a good idea to have the info on hand. You really can't go wrong and it could just save your life.
0061134007|4.0|I really enjoyed this first of the detective mystery series starring Harry Hole. Nesbo does an admirable job of weaving in the history of WWII Norway as a backdrop to how many of the characters from that past fit into the current tense of this mystery's puzzle while simultaneouly imparting some Norwegian history as it relates to Norway's role in WWII. Perhaps part of the reason I didn't give this book 5 stars is that I read it in tiny fragments over 6 months time and that is really no way to read any book, let alone a detective novel. I would advise any reader to pay close attention to the details of the earlier chapters lest they forget who was who and what they were doing as the book progresses. It was a little slow for me to plod through those details, but the details give the necessary backdrop to serve the rest of the book's arcs and subplots. By the time you are halfway through the book, momentum has built sufficiently to turn it into more of a page turner with each passing page. Harry is a very likeable anti-hero type of guy. Some sort of renegade cop replete with bad habits and inner demons but who is uniquely intuitive, crafty and someone you will care about. You will root for Harry Hole. Nesbo also has a flair for weaving surprising plot twists with tension and excitement. He is crafty like Harry. That in turn, gives me the desire to pick up the next book of this series.
B002JWD6AS|5.0|ok seriously guys we dont need to argue over a little thinglike this its only a book. sure we can sa our opinions but dont write another review arguing with that person about there opinion

B004A8ZWXS|5.0|I am old enough  to remember, as a boy, meeting the survivors and widows of the First World War.  In a sense, it has become a \\"forgotten\\" war with History Channel 1 & 2 focusing on pawn brokers and Hitler. (Not just the History Channels by the way.)  War Horse brings back a forgotten era of slaughter and poor decisions by politicians.  And it makes it more interesting through the eyes of Joey, and how Joey affects the lives of the many people who stumble upon him  There isn't any judgement in the film, which side is \\"moral\\", but, ultimately that humanity can come to the front in an otherwise inhumane world.  This is a 5 star movie.
B004QSQMKE|1.0|If you want the right version of Legend make SURE it says \\"Theatrical Version\\" before you buy. The directors's cut does not end the way the theater version does. It is disappointing to put it mildly. The \\"Ultimate\\" version is the only version that has both endings and the theatrical version is hard to find. I no likey the directors cut.
B004I744AS|4.0|Useful, though haven't had achance to try offline mode. A worthy addition to my toolbox. If it's as good as the web site, it'll be very, very helpful.
140053271X|2.0|I bought the Nook Touch instead of the Kindle because it was on sale for $75, which is still alot to pay for something that can only be used to read books. I didn't realize that if you buy books from B&N, you can only read them on your Nook, and not on anything else.  So even though you paid for them, those books really aren't your property.  You have no access to them if you don't use their products! Still, I liked the fact that it used ePub, and you had a variety of stores you could buy from and also that libraries have more ePub books available.  However, I just heard that their latest firmware update prevents you from reading any books except those bought from B&N. If I had known this I never would have bought the Nook. It's as consumer un-friendly as you can get!  Really a nasty way to do business.  Amazon is different.  Once you buy a book, it is yours.  You can read it on any device. When it comes to buying books, Amazon is far easier to use and alot more consumer friendly.  The Kindle is by far a better choice of the two.  I am returning the Nook after only a week, because this is a frustrating product that doesn't function like it is supposed to do.  There are simply too many glitches in how the touch screen works to be reliable. Here are the cons:  First, it often takes multiple touches to access anything.  You touch or swipe the screen, and nothing happens.  You try it again, and still nothing.  What a joke.  Second, pages turn mysteriously on their own and without warning, both forward and backward.  I am always losing my place when I try to read a book.  I've noticed that this happens almost every time you alter the angle of the Nook.  If you're reclining and turn to adjust the pillow, don't expect to return back to the same page you were on.  Third, the pop-up menu and dictionary are too easy to activate by accident.  If you hold the Nook too close to the screen, or at the top or bottom, the pop-up menu will appear or the dictionary will activate unintentionally.  This happens several times an hour.  You can't just simply sit down, relax and read unless you sit motionless in a chair and hold it on your lap. Last of all, it does not use a standard USB/micro USB cable. The USB connection to the computer is standard, but the micro USB connection to the Nook itself is NOT!  It is thinner and wider.  You can only use the cord provided with the Nook to connect to your computer to transfer files or charge the batteries.  You can't use the standard USB cord that works with all of your other electronic gadgets, like your digital camera or your portable hard drive.  So if you need a longer cord, or lose their cord, you're out of luck. Talk about a major inconvenience, one that makes zero sense!  Pros: I did like that it recharges in under 4 hours and that it has a very long battery life.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Easy to learn but plenty of strategy. Expandable, and extendable. If you plan to play with just two people though, you'll want the Traders and Barbarians expansion (which also adds the event cards to replace the dice!!!).  It's also really fun.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Wonderful app.  Best bible app out there!  If your looking for a bible app for your kindle fire, don't pass this one up.

B005OCFGTO|5.0|This item was a great price and it was shipped very fast.  I am very very happy with this item. I would recommend this product to everyone who enjoys Harry Potter.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Not even sure what to say... Wow.  Overclocks like a dream. Combined with H80 cooler for now and it runs at 5Ghz, and still doesn't even hit 80 degrees. It's fast.
B002ZG99A4|3.0|Disc had a scratch and will not play all the way thru... fizzles and dies after scene 10.  The movie is ok, probably wouldn't buy again though.  Also, think I'm finished buying used.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great replay value. The game is good and u can replay levels to get more credits to unlock more games.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I haven't been much of a Stephen King fan in the past couple of decades. When I was a teen, I ate up his horror novels--for some reason, \\"Thinner\\" left a mark on me I won't forget--but my tastes changed over time and outside of Dean Koontz I mostly read thrillers that are more grounded in accepted reality.  However, I started reading the buzz about this book so I decided to purchase and read Under the Dome, the latest King novel before 11/22/63, to see if perhaps I should give Mr. King another chance and spend the money on his latest. To my surprise and delight, I loved Under the Dome and eagerly awaited 11/22/63.  The plot has been rehashed in all of the reviews, so I won't get into that, but the ending has stuck with me since I finished over a week ago and I find my mind wandering to the what-ifs pretty frequently. All of our choices have a domino effect and really do change our own paths and those of others. This isn't some new revelation but it's something most of us don't spend a lot of time thinking about. Mr. King manages to impart the lesson while portraying a very sweet love story that ends in an unexpected way.   He also make me ache for simpler days that I haven't experienced in far too long. He only pays lip service to the numerous problems of the 50s and 60s (racism was mentioned a couple of times, very briefly), which I definitely consider a flaw in the book, but danged if I mostly wish I wasn't always connected to my job and everyone I know via smartphone. *sigh*  Highly recommended. And I'm a speed-reader so I extra-appreciate the very long books Mr. King writes, since it takes me several days to finish one and makes it even more worth my money!
159102594X|5.0|This book fulfills the usual sword and sorcery cliches in an unusual and interesting way.  We have the battle-hardened Northern barbarian, the powerful magician, the bumbling magician's apprentice, a spoiled young nobleman, and a band of fierce mercenaries.  The author does a great job of transcending the usual fantasy tropes by giving each character a distinct voice and history.  The battle scenes are gritty and realistic, but there is also an undertone of humor to the novel.  Rather than trying to capture it myself, let me give you an example:  \\"A dour-faced woman was working at a spinning wheel on a doorstep, and she frowned at Logen as he walked past with the unconscious apprentice over his shoulder.  Logen smiled back at her.  She was no beauty, that was sure, but it had been a very long time.  The woman ducked into her house and kicked the door shut, leaving the wheel spinning.  Logen sighed.  The old magic was still there.\\"  Maybe I'm actually a battle-hardened barbarian, because this sounds exactly like something I would actually think to myself.  So what should one expect from a good sword and sorcery novel?  Non-stop action?  Check.  Ancient mysteries?  Check.  Palace intrigue?  Check.  Main characters caught up in a conflict beyond their control?  Check.  Moral ambivalence? Not necessarily, but here anyway.  Throw in well-written dialogue, well-imagined characters, an understandable antagonist, and you have the makings of a brilliant series.  The one minor quibble I would have with this novel, and which others have expressed more or less heatedly, is that it serves mostly as set-up without a true conclusion.  In the end all the loose ends have not been neatly tied up.  I am willing to overlook that in hopes that the next installment will work towards that goal.  Absolutely couldn't put it down.  4.7/5 stars.
B0056BU3I2|5.0|I would definitely recommend this movie, it is AWESOME! My family loves it! So please go out and get yourself a copy.
1419702238|4.0|Dont know what it is about this corky book but the kids seem to love it. Since my daughter has the other Wimpy Kid books, she was happy with th collection.
B004QX07G4|1.0|I love Ellen.  I have some of her stand up comedies on DVD, I try to watch her as often as I can, and I talk about her all the time to people.  Well when I started reading the book it was semi-entertaining.  I could completely picture her saying the things.  I am very disappointed though that the book has no point to it.  It is just like she write about whatever thought comes to mind with no point to them at all.  It just seemed like she wrote a book to say \\"Hey, I wrote another book.\\"  I have ended up skipping chapters because I couldn't take the nonsense writing any longer.  Not worth the money I spend on purchasing it.
0553582038|2.0|At this point A Feast for Crows has gathered over 1000 reviews.  Rather than discuss the plot intricacies and characters in vivid detail, which other reviewers have no doubt done in greater depth and with more clarity than I could, I only plan to add a brief two cents.  The first novels in this series were good.  Really good.  But there are so many different plots and characters, at some point in the second or third novel, most readers must begin to wonder \\"How is the author ever going to bring all these different elements together into a satisfying conclusion?\\"  This novel makes the answer painfully clear: He's not.  There is no theme, no consistency, and rather than trying to bring the tangled shoots back together, this novel sprouts off into ten new directions, raising more questions than the reader could ever realistically hope to have answered.   The pacing is slack, the action is nonexistent, and the entire novel revolves around minor characters no one who read the first three novels gives a damn about to begin with.  This is the point where I cut my losses and vowed not to indulge the author's pedantic descriptions of random bits of history and heraldic colors and insignia in a made-up world any further.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I could play this game hours on end.. and sometimes do. I recommend this app to anyone that likes to play solitaire.
B0055S348W|5.0|I got this app for free a while back during an amazon free app of the day promotion. I have to say, I had no idea how great of an app i was getting for free!   Simply put, it prints everything. Docx, pdf, photo, contacts, call log, excel spreadsheets, you name it. It found my obscure HP c8180 and printed with ease. Also, having a physical print out of my contacts - complete with photo and all details is just awesome.  I use this app daily.  Just yesterday I was at best buy and I had left my coupon at home. Instead of waiting in line at customer sevice, off to the printer isle I went and printed my $20 coupon.  If you need to print somthing and your current mobile printing solution is not working well for you, chances are this will hit the spot.
B005HSL626|3.0|well this is not a 5 star or 4 star because some of the levels are a little tricky like getting the shadow blade its impossible. but don't get me wrong..this is still a really cool game!! I would recommend it to be for 7 and up. still super cool!!
B00684J49U|5.0|I purchased this for my 22 year old daughter. I have purchased all the season's for her. I received product in a timely matter. Packaging was fine.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|The Hunger Games is supposedly a book written well; of an adventure. But, as I read the first few pages, I instantly got bored. It was a waste to spend my money on a book that was very deceitful to me. I soon read on the first few chapters and realized I had gotten no where. The plot and the spark weren't in me, as usually, most books I enjoy. I hope that future readers will not buy this book for its boring plot and characters.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Oh! did I enjoy this? Yes I did!   The special features is as good as the movie.   It was absolutely fascinating to see how they did the special effects to make this movie. I found myself saying wow! as I saw how much work was involved to make this movie.   I also enjoy watching the extended and deleted scenes because it gives you an idea of what could have been included but wasn't.   What amazes me so much about these Twilight movies is that each one has a different director but the movies continue to just pick up and keep going as if the same person was directing. You also get to hear what the actors think and how they feel about each director.  Each special edition also gives the viewer an opportunity to sort of get to know the directors for each movie and to see how much they interacted with the stars and the entire crew.   There is an audio commentary with the two stars Robert Pattinson & Kristen Stewart and also an audio commentary with Stephenie Meyer & Wyck Godfrey.  The documentary on the making of this movie will keep your eyes glued to the screen. I enjoy watching this movie and the special features over and over again.  The entire Twilight Saga Series is great.   I am on the waiting list for Breaking Dawn Pt.1. I can't even imagine what the special features for that one is going to be like but I'm a waiting to see.
B002ZTQVGQ|3.0|Truth be told, all of this Japanese animation (excuse me, \\"anime\\") gives me \\"Speed Racer\\" cartoon flashbacks; I bought this for my daughter, who loves this kind of stuff, but myself (being 414 years old) looks amaturish to me, even though I'v been told that the hand-drawn artwork is impressive and intentional.  The story's cute but tends to be juvenile and stretches credibility at times.  Probably good for younger kids but older fans might want to check out \\"Sprited Away\\" and \\"Princess Mononoke\\".
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love playing this game on my kindle fire! great free app. haven't had any issues with it at all.
0316056863|5.0|This book was so great I had to force myself to only read a little bit at a time because I didn't want to finish it too quickly! It's pure Tina and a truly enjoyable read.
B000I62JAK|5.0|This movie is hysterical. I saw it when it first came out and loved it. I don't know why it didn't get too much traction in the box office. Maybe it wasn't crass enough for audiences. I watched it many times and when my kids grew up older, I watch it with them also. We are constantly quoting from the movie. It's our inside joke.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is a great app. I use it to write my personal journal on the go and email it to myself. I can print it out later when I have the time.  I also use it to write lesson plans for my preschool and take it with me so I know exactly whet we are doing that day.  Finally, I make my to-do lists with this program and it lets me check them off.   Each type of entry can be organized in a book/catagory. Woks great.

B005FITIGO|3.0|It's not often I'm lost for words when it comes to writing reviews... and no it's not in a good way I just don't really know what can be said about this film.  The cast is pretty impressive and there are some real big names in here - Kevin Spacey, Demi Moore, Zachary Quinto etc. but the plot just seems a bit lacking.  Basically a financial firm ends up in a bad spot financially and needs to find a way out of it - this comes with a huge loss of jobs.  Yes, the film illustrates how the normal man can go from a well paid job to nowhere within a few hours but I don't really see the point to the film - or rather I do I just don't see why they made this film out of such a \\"normal\\" story.  I'm not after huge special affects but this just seems rather lackluster and for such a star cast I expected a little bit more.  This is probably the worst review in history as I don't know what to say - the cast are good, the acting is good but the story line is well urgh.  Maybe it's because it was advertised as a thriller but it's more of an economic drama that I'm struggling to say anything - it's not really my kind of film.
B003KUZSWW|4.0|Doctor who is a great show. But for some reason BOTH Amazon and Netflix fail to list the last for episodes of season 4, including the finale which explains why **spoiler alert** Matt Smith takes over as the Doctor in season 5.<br /><br />This information is **not** a spoiler<br />after episode 15 \\"The Next Doctor\\" comes:<br /><br />16 Planet of the Dead<br />17 Waters of Mars<br />18 The End of Time Part 1<br />19 The End of Time Part 2<br /><br />All great episodes and my god, missing the 2 part finale, crazy!
B0034G4P9E|5.0|I was unprepared to see such a classic performance by two actors I have never seen before in an MMA related movie. There were so many story lines and plots in the movie, that it completely overshadows the MMA, that wives and girlfriends alike would enjoy seeing this movie as well.. Nick nolte is cast perfectly as the drunk father of the two brothers.. He becomes sober, and trains one of them who has gone AWOL from the war in Iraq.. The older brother is a physics teacher, but is then suspended from his job, as he fights to help maintain his home and family.  If you are a big MMa fan, you would enjoy it somewhat, although the MMA is tarnished somewhat by the Coda Aka Kurt Angle, who does some pro wrestling moves that are too unrealistic for the MMA... It also seemed to be a big promotion for TapOut, which is the biggest producer of MMA apparel in the world. The movie was dedicated to it's creator Charles Mask Lewis, who died in an Motocycle accident two years ago.  At the end of the movie, I said to myself, that this was a highly underrated movie and should have gotten more acclaim for the whole production.. Too bad it did not do well in the box office.. Now people should rent/buy it.. Definitely!

0571283578|1.0|Fans of Jane Austen, and fans of the \\"normal\\" PD James mysteries should avoid this book.  I am a fan of both and wish I had been warned not to buy it or read it.  It was facile and dreary.  Character development, a long suit that Austen fans come to expect, does not happen.  Complex and subtle mystery plot which James' fans come to expect is absent.  What is worse is that PD James attempts to expand on relationships or interpretations of events from the Austen novels and put a new spin on those past events/relationships.  And it doesn't work.  I have read and re-read Jane Austen novels many times.  Similarly with PD James mysteries.   I just finished reading Death Comes to Pemberly and am trying to decide whether to give the book away to the local Thrift Store or put it in the recycling bin.  I will never be re-reading this book or recommending it.

0765322889|2.0|WARNING: I've only managed to complete around 40% of the book before giving up. Continuing on would have been a hazard to my own health and sanity.<br /><br />First off, there are generally about three major concepts to having a good book, at least in my eyes. I'm no famous author by any means but as a avid fantasy book reader, there are just some things I experience whenever reading a good book no matter who written it. These concepts include:<br /><br />#1. Interesting characters. Any book is not worth reading, fiction or non-fiction wise, if the characters are boring and flat! As the story progresses, you develop certain emotions for certain key characters. Whether you cheer for the protagonist, root for the villain, get teary eyed when a character dies or whatever, interesting and exciting characters is what drives the story forward and compels you to read further on.<br />#2. Awesome storyline. Having an interesting storyline is the second most important aspect to a good book. Obviously if the story fails to capture the readers attention, then the reader themselves will see no point in continuing. While many books seem cliche, I can't put 100% of the blame on the authors because let's face it, what hasn't been done before?!<br />#3. Vivid world and surroundings. The last concept is painting a vivid world for the interesting characters and storyline for the book. With many fantasy books, the authors have pretty much free reign to let their imagination go wild. The hard part is writing and describing it in a way that the readers can share the same visions as the author originally intended.<br /><br />Gardens of the Moon, up to the point I stopped reading, failed on all three concepts. First of all, characters in the book like Paran, Tattersail, Whiskeyjack and Quick Ben are all boring and lifeless. They think the same and even talk in the same fashion as all other characters. The author also did a horrible job at describing the physical traits of the characters! This makes it really hard as a reader to visualize them in our mind. Add the fact that these characters are completely lifeless and what you get are characters that you absolutely have no intention of caring for. You don't care if they die or not because there is no emotional attachment to them! In fact, I don't even know what most of the character's goals are in the story! It seems that they just trudge along for the ride. I sense that vengeance is a big part of it (killing Laseen, the Empress) but the author just doesn't seem capable of driving that point home, hence the confusion.<br /><br />The storyline is one that needs a lot of tweaking. Being that this book is set in a fantasy world, the author must do a good job at explaining things such as the world's history and magic system to the readers. Because this is the first book in the series, it is even that much more important as you are depending on this book to hook the readers in to continue on with the series (in this case, a whopping nine others). Well, the author completely negates this fact and assumes that you already know what has happened in the world. This can lead to a lot of confusion. The book obviously includes a lot of different characters and so there will be a lot of hopping around between them. My main gripe with the author is that he does a pretty poor job at managing them. He jumps around so much that while it may not necessarily be hard to follow along with, it manages to lose the attention of the reader. Only certain authors can do this and get away with it and that is due to their awesome writing abilities. If you've read George Martin, Brandon Sanderson or even Stephen King novels before, you already know what I'm talking about. I hate to have to bring in other authors in a review to make a point but I really have no option here.<br /><br />What small credit I can give to the author is his effort in trying to paint a lush world for this series. However, in the end, it's still pretty lackluster and just can't be compared to other fantasy books I've read in the past. The magic system is a mystery to me and once again, the author doesn't help at all by not going over the details. He might have done this during the later part of the book but its too late for me because I've already given up on this book and series.<br /><br />In the end, while many readers have thoroughly enjoyed this book and series, I along with many others have seen differently. You know you're not nitpicking about things when all of the other negative reviews of this book on Amazon all state the same thing over and over again. Flat and boring characters that you absolutely have no care of whether they live or die, boring storyline that seemingly goes nowhere, lack of history details and explanation by the author, horrible character names (Tattersail?) and a bunch of others. What I'll say here is what I'll say time and time again whenever I leave a book unfinished. Life is too short to invest so much of my time on badly written books. Will it get better as the series progress? I have no idea. I can only hope so for the other readers who chose to continue on with the series even though they hated the first book. If not, I can't even begin to imagine what reading the other nine books will be like.ooks I've read in the past.

B003PIUBZS|4.0|I've owned this set for a while and I never did a review on it. I feel compelled to do one as I've been going through my collection of movies, games, and books and started doing some reviews on them. This one needs to be done sooner than later.<br /><br />So what's there to be said about the Spartacus first season? It's amazing. I'm one of those ancient history buffs and while I understand that the show isn't \\"realistic\\" or accurate to history per se, and that the events surrounding the Spartacus revolt were made \\"cinematic\\" and \\"hollywood\\" style here... it doesn't make the story and scenes that less entertaining.<br /><br />I remember walking through Wally World one day and saw this DVD set on the shelf. I looked at it, shrugged, and bought it on a whim. This is right when the first season was released and I hadn't heard about it at all. Of course, I've never really had Starz, Encore, HBO (except in the 90's) and never was exposed to it. So I brought it home.<br /><br />I watched the series through over the course of two days. I didn't stop at all except to sleep and eat. I thought it was amazing. The special effects were a tad over zealous (ala the movie \\"300\\"), but the scenes were believable. A lot of green screen work was used in this and while I understand the reasoning, and while I wasn't impressed as I would have with a real set, I could picture it enough.<br /><br />Spartacus for the new viewer was a slave who fought as a gladiator and then caused one of the more successful uprisings in Romes history. As all other revolts it ended tragically, but it caused a lot of strife in Rome and got the politicians, and money makers worried. Sanctions were plenty after the revolt to ensure it didn't happen again and in this show you can see why (even if they presented it out of accuracy).<br /><br />Spartacus is portrayed by the late Andy Whitfield. I've seen some behind the scenes work of him and I must say he seemed like one of those REAL down to Earth actors. It's such a shame that he died the way he did so early. I guess one of the things you can take from this, was that he sure left his mark and legacy with this show. I hear that the new Spartacus for season \\"two\\" (there was a prequel season as well) is being played by an actor that Andy himself chose as a replacement when he underwent his recovery. They feared he might not become stable enough for the role so he helped choose a new Spartacus. His choice carried over after his death and I imagine the shoes (or sandals) are now being filled with mixed emotions by the new actor. Any how sorry, I just wanted to recognize Andy for a minute.<br /><br />Spartacus goes on an adventure here that puts him inside the walls of a ludus (a gladiator training school). He learns quickly his place among the other \\"veteran\\" fighters but shows his determination and skill over many fights. It was amazing watching him obviously progress from the green fighter to champion and have it be both believable and clear (you could see him improve physically and mentally).<br /><br />Along the way there are a number of obstacles... people he fights, those he's wronged in the past, and his striving to become the champion he needs to be to enact a certain revenge. It was well scripted, well acted, and fun to watch. I was certainly impressed by every minute that passed by.<br /><br />I will say without ruining any surprises, that this is not a show for the faint of heart. Blood, gore, sex, nudity, and everything in between is plentiful here. This is certainly not for most people. I never read other reviews before posting, but I'll bet at least a handful of people disliked this on the sex scenes alone.<br /><br />In the end you'll either love or hate this show. It's a mix of the tv show \\"Rome\\", and the movie \\"300\\" with a touch of \\"Gladiator\\" mixed all into one. The actors (from the Doctore, to Crixus, to Batiatus) were so well crafted. Lucy Lawless who I've watched only in Xena/Hercules (which let's be honestwere rather silly shows at best) was fantastic. She was the type of character I rooted against, and wanted the utmost bad things to happen to (and her little she-devil friend). But the characters were ones you could instantly connect with one way or another.<br /><br />Buy it. Buy it now. It's not perfect, it has some flaws... but it's VERY good. I may subscribe to Starz just to catch the next season even though I most certainly am not happy with Andy not continuing the series. I look forward to seeing what they do with history.ainst, and wanted the utmost bad things to happen to (and her little she-devil friend).

B003O86FMW|5.0|A great book. At the end of book one The Hunger Games I had no idea how the author would play out the next book. it is definitely one of the books to read again.<br />  Katniss and Peeta are sopn to be newlyweds  although Gale also claimes he loves her. Then the president shows up at her house.<br />  Katniss survived the hunger game, although unintended by the President, who is now out to get her. He creates what he thinks will be the ideal finish off... A hunger games where the tributes are picked from the victors. Katniss and Peeta go in together. The hunger games have started all over again, cancelling Katniss's and Peeta's wedding. Meanwhile in the town, the rebellion has spread.

B004EPYZXK|4.0|I read the bad reviews but decided to check this out anyway. One positive thing I can say is that it's suspenseful. In the beginning, you are chewing your nails wondering what is happening. Honestly, in all of these outer space sci fi horror/suspense movies, I am usually disappointed with the outcome. This was no different. This movie could have been much better. When you find out the source of the suspense, it's kind of a let down. Then it goes from that to predictable. You can just see what's coming next & it does. Since most of this movie is grainy old film, Blu-Ray won't be much of an investment. What made this story sound good was that we all know & believe that the Dept of Defense would conduct secret missions, could send men to the moon or anywhere else without even their family knowing. This gave the basis of the movie, and the fact that it was going to be a space mission, a lot of potential. Eventually it just turns out to be another cheesy scifi movie. I gave it 4 stars because of the suspense, the acting was well done & it was entertaining enough to make it worth the money I spent renting it.
1583334386|5.0|I highly recommend this book! It is a practical, grounded guide to empowerment through self-awareness. You are invited to be a gentle observer of your own life: how you talk to yourself, what temps you, when do you procrastinate, and how you judge yourself. Then using compassion and self-forgiveness, you can choose actions that support the life you desire. Everyone can use a book like this!
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|The Tree of Life, the latest film by Terrence Malick, won the Palme d'Or at the 2011 Cannes Film Festival and has been compared to Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. Like that film, it has received polarized reviews from critics and like Malick's previous work it pushes the boundaries of cinema and is not immediately accessible. It's a film that requires you to think, to analyze, and to discuss; it's not a film that you can sit back and watch at any time. In telling the story of one family, Malick takes his film all the way back to the creation of the universe with the Big Bang. This is not a film without ideas and ambition. The Tree of Life does not intend to entertain, but rather to evoke. It's an existential work that's pacing and scope resembles 2001 to such an extent Malick could have titled it \\"2011: An Earth Odyssey.\\"  Lacking a linear plot, there is no description of the plot that I can provide without giving you a false idea of what the film is about. What little I can say is that the film illustrates the childhood memories of Jack (played as an adult by Sean Penn), including his memories of his strict father (Brad Pitt) and his passive mother (Jessica Chastain, whom I find bears a striking resemblance to the Swedish actress Liv Ullman). Throughout the film, as you'd expect if you've seen any of Malick's previous work, several characters deliver whispered voice-overs that ask questions about God, faith, life, death, loss and time.  While the dialogue poses some important questions about the themes explored, it's probably the most irrelevant part of the film as Malick and his cinematographer Emmanuel Lubezski emphasize images over words. Malick is one of the great visual filmmakers and he uses images so beautifully that this film is almost entertaining based on the beauty of the images alone. Whether you love or hate this film you can't deny the beauty of it. Malick's eye, the cinematography, and Jack Fisk's production design make this film a wonder tobehold. There are some incredible shots of nature throughout and even shots that simply feature Penn wandering through a vast wasteland are haunting and startling in their impact.  There are many special effects (yes, including dinosaurs) and even these are fascinating and beautiful, which can also be attributed to Alexandre Desplat's beautiful, operatic score. As many of them have stayed with me long after the credits rolled, I can't rave enough about the images that drive this movie. As a dream-life evocation of childhood, this film succeeds on a remarkably existential, and perhaps even esoteric, level. The final thirty minutes are some of the most beautiful and moving images I've seen on film, but I can't say that I think The Tree of Life is a perfect film nor can I ignore how indulgent much of it is.  It's a film built on images and it's been written that Malick will reject shots without an artistic aesthetic, but these shots do grow repetitious at times. The pacing will trouble many and I admit that the film felt much longer than it was, but that's not to say I was bored by it. While some will be drawn in by the beauty of it, others will be alienated by the slow pacing and the overindulgence. Know this; The Tree of Life is less of a film than an experience and it is best seen on the big screen.  While imperfect, The Tree of Life is a rather profound cinematic tapestry that doesn't spoon-feed its themes to you and instead allows you to interpret them how you wish and come to your own conclusions. It does evoke emotion in such a way that I've already found it growing in stature in my mind and wish to see it again as soon as possible. It begs to be seen more than once as it gives you so much to take in and to consider that a single viewing can't possibly do it justice. It's a pretentious film, but that's not necessarily a bad thing; in fact, it's the best film I've seen so far this year and I highly recommend it for the curious viewer.  GRADE: A-
0756404738|4.0|A massive 1000 page second part to Patrick Rothfuss's Kingkiller trilogy.  The first novel \\"The name of the wind\\" was a deservedly massive hit and expectations were high for the next volume.  Wise Man's Fear is more of the same, superb storytelling that is not linier but diverts off into all sorts of directions.  Possibly annoying for those who like a clear beginning, middle and end, but the writing is so good it is easy to forgive this and go with the swing and style of the story.  Again we have the famous Kvothe, a legend in the land, in the role of an innkeeper, Kote.  We have yet to find why Kvothe has decided to step out of the limelight but as he tells his story to the visiting Chronicler  we find out more and more about how the legend was formed.  Kvothe is still in his teens as the story ends so we obviously have  a long way to go and I would be surprised (and disappointed) if the author finishes this as a trilogy!<br /><br />Slight frustrations as Kvothe seems the smartest teenager in the world but that is a minor quibble in a standout book of fantasy.  As the tales unravel and Kvothe takes a kind of gap year from University, we see how his legend grows and the backstory to some of those legends.  There is also a dark undercurrent like a shadow on a wall that suggests much is wrong with the world Kvothe inhabits and the author has yet to give us a real glimpse of what it is.  Storytelling at its best.

0061969656|4.0|I'll confess that the Old English names for towns and individuals slowed my reading at first, especially since many of the names, of both towns and people are very similar. I often had to stop and think, is this one friend or foe, so this slowed my progress some. However, as I continued to read this became less of a problem and I was allowed to more fully enjoy the story. And the story is quite good. Told from the perspective of Uhtred, a Dane and non-Christian who fights for Christian Saxon kings. The story continues to spiral toward a conclusion full of intrigue and action. One thing that sets this novel, set about 900 A.D., apart from others of the genre is that it comes in at just over 300 pages. This points to Cornwell's to-the-point writing style. Especially when Uhtred is speaking, the writing also is very clever. This is my first book of Cornwell's to read, so I have not read previous entries in the Saxon Chronicles, but I found this to be a fine read even without that background.

B004NSULHM|5.0|Let me first \\"give a shout out\\" to NPR who keeps brining focus to amazing musical artists...a relatively short time ago, during my drive home from work, I was listening to an interview with Radiohead regarding this album.  Immediately after I got home, I listened to more samples from the album and was compelled to buy The King of Limbs right then!  I truly knew nothing about Radiohead until that day, and I am SO GLAD that I was tuned in at the right time.  This album is wonderfully understated, as well as complex, and haunting.  With every listen, I am soothed and also intrigued.  It's just really great.

B00JKOI180|4.0|I had the muddy sounding bootlegged version of this album that was floating around in fan circles just before the massive 1996-1997 Reunion tour.  I originally dismissed the album when the band's label later released it during the Reunion tour and didn't buy it until a couple years later and boy, did that help.  I was pleasantly surprised at how well written the songs were.  I had some trouble buying Paul's vocal style in this style of music but his songs are surprisingly strong and much better than the majority of material he had on the band's prior two releases and Gene and Bruce shine through on this album.  I like this release better than the band's 1992 Revenge and 1989's Hot In The Shade.  If you are new to the band or can't bring yourself to give this album an honest listen, do yourself a favor and pick this one up, put on some headphones and &#34;go one L-O-U-D-E-R to E-L-E-V-E-N&#34;
0380807343|5.0|Neil Gaiman has done it again. Here is another tale to thrill young readers. Is it dark? Yes. Strange? Yes. But it is also captivating and magical in a way that really great children's books are.   Coraline Jones and her parents have just moved to a new flat. While exploring one day, Coraline discovers a door in the corner of the drawing room--a door that leads to a house just like hers, though it is slightly 'off' and certainly more interesting. She also encounters her 'other' mother and father in this house, who desperately want her to stay in their world, \\"forever and always.\\" Coraline must summon all her courage and smarts if she is to conquer her fears and the other mother, and return to her boring old life.  Coraline is a wonderful character: smart, brave, and real. Like Nobody Owens in [[ASIN:0060530944 The Graveyard Book]], Gaiman has crafted another very authentic-feeling child as a main character. The author creates an 'other' world which is frightening and richly described. Readers will feel as if they are right alongside Coraline on her strange journey, discovering these fantastical things with her. (And as a cat lover, I have to say that I loved the fact that a cat was Coraline's \\"trusty sidekick\\"!). This is definitely a darker fantasy story, but I would still recommend it to children 9/10 and up. A fascinating and otherworldly read.

B0036CWK8O|5.0|It had been a while since I listened to Helloween and bought this on a whim.  I threw it in and started hearing horns and a way different arrangement of Dr. Stein at first I thought \\"What?!\\" but as I started running down the cd I was blown away by the musical diversity of the band.  I always knew they were great players but never really thought about what they would sound like playing outside the parameters of their defined genre.  It's a different take on Helloween classics and usually hard rock and metal bands fail miserably when they attempt daring projects like this, reworking their material in attempts of being \\"new\\" and \\"different\\" and \\"updated\\" but Helloween really pulls it off.  They achieve it with style, taste and integrity. These guys are world class musicians and this album just reinforces that.  Other metal bands like Metallica, Megadeth, Queensryche and Judas Priest should take a few notes on how it's done.
0439813786|5.0|Not only is this one of the most visually stunning books I've ever come across, but it is an amazing story as well. Partially told in words and partially told via Selznick's beautifully rendered pencil illustrations, this is the story of Hugo Cabret--orphan and clock keeper. Living in the walls of a Parisian train station, Hugo's world is full of secrets and mysteries, including his father's old notebook and a strange mechanical man. When he crosses paths with the curmudgeonly old man who runs a toy booth and a bookish, kind girl, Hugo's world is turned upside down, and he discovers that there are others who have secrets too.  Selznick weaves a complex story and a compelling mystery for readers 9 and up. The characters are vivid, and the setting (Paris in the 1930s) is just the perfect backdrop for the mysteries that unfold over the course of the book. The pencil illustrations and old photographs that pepper the book's pages are simply wonderful--they add such depth to the magic and wonder of the story, which is sure to capture any child's imagination, as it captured mine. Highly recommend this one.

B000001DYJ|3.0|This was a great lineup who put on a great live show but this album is my least favorite of the Alive series.  There should have been way more 80s songs on there like Tears Are Falling, Crazy Nights, Reason To Live, Who Wants To Be Lonely and Hide Your Heart.  This lineup could have pulled off those songs easily.  People complain about the production and audience but I think it sounds pretty cool.  Highlights are Creatures of the Night, I Was Made For Loving You, Lick It Up, I Love It Loud, Forever, God Gave Rock and Roll To You, Domino, I Still Love You and Heaven's On Fire.  Lowlights are Unholy, I Just Wanna and all the songs that were already done before on Alive! and Alive II.
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down, 2001 film  The movie begins with a man preparing a body for burial in the desert. This is \\"Somalia - East Africa 1992\\". Years of warfare among the people created a famine. A powerful warlord ruled the capital of Mogadishu, he seized food shipments to use as a weapon. The US sent 20,000 Marines to restore order and deliver food. In April 1993 Aidid declared war on the UN peacekeepers, then targeted American personnel. The US sent soldiers to Mogadishu to remove Aidid in just three weeks. But six weeks passed without accomplishing this mission. This is the story of that operation.  We see food trucks being attacked by desperate people (like some Holiday sales in December 2011). Machine guns fire into the crowd. The US helicopters cannot intervene. A journalist reports on the presence of a person of interest. Outside the city helicopters attack his car to arrest him. he is a businessman who knows General Aidid and sells weapons. He lectures the American general on local politics. \\"This isn't Iraq.\\" A new soldier arrives in camp. We hear a comment about a Delta Force soldier with a \\"hot\\" weapon. The soldiers talk about their lives. One soldier is suddenly sick.  In `Mog' there is a meeting among top leaders. Can they be kidnapped by a helicopter attack? Black Hawk helicopters will provide air cover when they enter this hostile territory. One soldier worries about the troops on the ground. The soldiers prepare for their mission; it is expected to be short. A spy on the ground drives a marked car to direct the helicopters to the right building. Soldiers board their helicopters. A radio warns the Somalians of approaching helicopters; the element of surprise is lost. The convoy of trucks approaches beneath the helicopters. The Somalians prepare barricades in the street.  Burning tires provides thick dense smoke to start the operation. Soldiers deploy from their helicopters to start the operation. Others slide down ropes. The Rangers shoot back at the Somalimilitia. The men captured in the building are extracted. The trucks speed out while exchanging gunfire. A 50-caliber machine gun defends each truck. A rocket-propelled grenade hits a helicopter and brings it down in a town square. \\"We just lost the initiative.\\" Soldiers are sent to view the crash site. The enemy is driven off, but others begin a new attack. Civilians approach the downed Black Hawk. [Notice the difference in sounds between an M-16 and an AK-47?] the trucks run a gauntlet of gunfire in the streets.  Soldiers arrive at the crash site to rescue the crew. There are more wounded. Another Black Hawk is shot down. RPG's do the most damage. The soldiers approach the crash site. Can they secure the perimeter? The enemy militia seems to be without limits. The soldiers are ordered to return to base. Can the others hold out? One soldier is captured alive. A rescue attempt attracts more attacks and casualties. A Somali officer explains their aims: \\"there can be no peace without victory\\". A field operation stops the bleeding from a severed artery. In the dark the militia attack again, and are attacked in return. Can the UN troops arrive to rescue them? Not for one soldier. A helicopter attacks the enemy. The soldiers are rescued by UN armed vehicles, alive or dead. But some have to run under fire to reach the safety of the stadium. The wounded get medical attention. Would the civilians back home understand why they do it?  The ending lists the 19 American soldiers killed in this raid. Over a thousand Somalis died too. Two weeks later Delta Force and the Rangers were withdrawn from Somalia. This is based on the book by Mark Bowden. This deserved more awards than it got. [Why were we in Somalia?]

159514188X|1.0|I really did not like this book. Let me start off my saying, I read it quickly. Within 5 hours and I was never once bored. What I don't like is how I left this book not feeling sorry for Hannah at all, not feeling any kind of connection to her or understanding of why she did what she did. Most of the reasons that she had to kill herself were honestly petty and small and the bigger reasons she had did not actually happen to her they were things that happened to other people. She spent and entire book complaining about how no one read her mind and helped her when she was in trouble but at the same time she stood back and watched someone being raped and did nothing about it and used someone else's terrible incident as another reason to feel sorry for her. I didn't like her when I read it. I felt she was sarcastic and went out of her way to hurt other people. She basically did everything to these people that they did her and we are expected to feel sorry for her. I feel it was a great concept that was wasted into a completely unpowerful book. I wanted to like this book but I really did not.
0446691437|5.0|A great book motivates you to take action.<br /><br />The overwhelming reason to read \\"The War of Art\\" is because it will make you write. As I read sections of the book, I became so motivated that I went directly to the computer and started pounding out text for my nest book.<br /><br />Were you put on this earth to be a writer?<br /><br />As Pressfield says, \\"Don't cheat us of your contribution. Give us what you've got.\\"<br /><br />There are three reasons that authors should read Steven Pressfield's book \\"The War of Art\\".<br /><br />1. To Recognize Your Biggest Enemy<br /><br />Your biggest enemy is resistance. The only thing standing between you, and you being the writer that you would like to be, is resistance. If you are a writer who doesn't write, then you know what resistance is. Resistance deforms our spirit and prevents us from utilizing the genius that God gave us, and from achieving what we were meant to achieve.<br /><br />In our brightest and most lucid moments, we can see the person that we were meant to be. What is stopping us form being that person? Resistance.<br /><br />Resistance does everything it can to distract us and discourage us from writing.<br /><br />As Pressfield says, the great secret to writing is:<br /><br />It's not the writing that's hard. What's hard is sitting down to write. What keeps us from sitting down is Resistance.<br /><br />2. To Combat Resistance<br /><br />Pressfield distinguishes between a professional writer and an amateur writer. An amateur writer only writes when he feels inspired. A professional writer writes every day. Resistance hates professionals.<br /><br />A professional knows that she becomes inspired, or taps into her genius, in the process of writing. The Muse doesn't start to come to her aid until she takes the first step.<br /><br />Although the professional makes money from his writing, she writes because she loves to write. The professional is also detached from her work. She knows that the work that she creates is separate from who she is as a person.<br /><br />This allows the professional to avoid flame out and false expectations about the time it takes to write a book (usually twice as long as imagined) and allows her to impartially accept criticism. The actions of others do not define the writer's reality.<br /><br />Regardless of what obstacles or distractions that Resistance may present to us, such as fear, illness, friends, headaches, or rejection, the writer soldiers on.<br /><br />3. To Reach Higher Realms, Beyond Resistance<br /><br />Pressfield points out that there are great forces who become our allies, as we move boldly forward. These forces, like the Greek Gods, take an interest in the affairs of humans, and intercede in our activities. Their activities explain how great works of art have been created.<br /><br />Pressfield identifies the possibility that great works of art, like the Fifth Symphony, may have already existed on a higher plane, before Beethoven ever wrote it. The music only \\"potentially\\" existed, but it didn't have a physical body. It needed a human to bring it into our plane of existence.<br /><br />The Muse may have whispered a few bars into Beethoven's ear. She may have previously whispered the same few bars into many thousands of other ears, but only Beethoven got it.<br /><br />Artists are like mothers. They don't make new life, they only bear it.<br /><br />In the end, writers don't write to advance their own standing. They write for the sake of writing, obey the guidance they get from their Muse, and ultimately, give birth to a work of art.<br /><br />Another great book to inspire authors is [[ASIN:1619490943 Self Reliance]] by Ralph Waldo Emerson.e it takes to write a book (usually twice as long as imagined) and allows her to impartially accept criticism.

B00008J2PG|5.0|\\"The Scarlet and the Black\\" is a moving depiction [based on a true story] of the very different choices made by two very different men during WWII.  It is a story of 'pride goeth before a fall and a haughty spirit before destruction', as well as the amazing story of a man who unabashadly stands on his faith.  It also portrays some of the horror that the Jewish people endured; something none of us should ever forget.
B0052FG8KO|5.0|I just found out about these guys recently and have been blown away by how good they are. 'In Progress' is a masterpiece of tight, polished production with soaring vocals and guitar-work. Sort of like a cross between Toto and Journey at times, these guys know how to put down tracks then are just infectious and uplifting. No fillers on an album that is just outstanding, which is a rarity these days. Particular favourites are 'The Great Fall', 'Eye of The Storm', 'Nature of the Game', 'Rain', 'Never Love again' 'Emelie' and 'Castaway' which are incredible tunes, however the whole album is fantastic without a weak track at all. Can't recommend these guys highly enough. Hopefully they get the recognition they deserve, in an age where autotune and oversexed, talentless, manufactured pop seems to far outweigh the truly great largely undiscovered artists such as Work Of Art.

B006BZ8WAI|2.0|All along the lines, KoRn have been figuratively \\"experimenting\\" all the way. They have never been more on top of remixing their rusty formulas from albums like Untouchables or TALITM. In the Path of Totality, KoRn reinvent a familiar voice, with the tradeoff to brostep influences. Don't get me wrong, this album isn't terrible, but it does lack a sense of vitality KoRn have shown in the past. Songs like \\"Narcissistic Cannibal\\" show true potential for the album with good breakdowns. But other songs and many are like this, such as \\"Get Up!\\" has blinding difficulty trying to get accustomed to the overall composure of the song. Due to instrumentation that often backstabs the songs simply because they're too noticeable or too loud so to speak, the songs are often drowned out and overrun. The Path of Totality also features some rather unnecessary artists. Even Skrillex attempts at many moments to thieve some of the fame off of this album, but ultimately traps himself in its waking disaster. Other featured artists seem to have no primary attributes that show this album any real shining point, and only solidify my tendencies to mention how this album blind's itself. Aside from taking cheap shots at the post-modern disappointments KoRn have up their sleeve, this album dedicates itself to a much more monumental disaster than even the cheap-skate artists featured on it: KoRn themselves. Primary to the contrary on how this album could've succeeded is the bands maturity levels. It is passed around from hundreds of thousands of audience members, and I have to agree, that KoRn is simply too old to be rambling about the same depression and desire lyrics they became famous for to begin with. Since hate is the only emotion Jonathan seems to be capable of exemplifying, perhaps the symbolizing for a more poorly designed album matches his taste. Aside from being too harsh on the overall composure, KoRn have tried too hard to become the very thing they were against in their outstanding debut album, and follow-ups, for the next 6 years. Only now, have KoRn finally been reduced to the rubble they used to build up their career.  To be perfectly honest, while the album is the most exemplary reinvention to KoRn's rusty traits, and outdated lyrics, I believe only the not-so hardcore KoRn fans will enjoy, because they won't have as great as an appreciation for the old content like their debut or Life is Peachy.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|Very difficult to use.  The menus are hard to get to and manipulate.  The buttons are touch sensitive on the rim of the watch, but they often don't do what you want no matter how you touch the rim.  The battery lasts less than a day and so using this as a watch by itself doesn't work either.  I feel this purchase was a total waste of money.
B001B6PBBK|1.0|Wow um what else to say but the first four minutes made me disgusted enough to feel slightly ill. I guess the review has to be 20 words long and so I suppose I'll also add that this was horrible.

I Want the original trilogies untouched as well but George Lukas is to Daft, Dumb, and Stupid to understand, or is just plain old greedy. actually lets just go with all of the above

1451629184|4.0|I remember when all of this happened. I remember the news broadcasts, the theories, and the hypotheses about what happened to her. And what makes her book so strong is that it explains everything. It was a very smart choice to write the story in present tense. Dugard's details are subtle, obviously that of a child's. and yet through saying so little, she says so much. Ultimately, it would be easy for me to say that Dugard isn't the best writer out there, but I don't believe strong writing or solid diction or things like that are the points here. This isn't a memoir that professors will use to teach students how to write creative nonfiction, but what it does accomplish is universality and humanity. How can anyone not feel for her?   I think the reason why readers will forgive her for things the book may lack is because it is written in her voice. Reading her story is kind of like sitting in a room with her and letting her tell the story to you. She even makes a disclaimer for her rambling, jumbled writing in the introduction, but I didn't think it was necessary. She told a story that many people wanted to hear. She answered questions that many people wanted to have answers for. Perhaps if she had written the story along with a professional writer, it would be easier to criticize her memoir and critique the nuances, but if that was the case, would readers really see her like we do after reading something directly from her? Probably not.  It's not a perfect book, but it's a powerful read. I've studied creative nonfiction for years and one cardinal rule is to keep emotions out of reviews and critiques. Here, I'm making an exception. If anyone ever feels like they're having a bad day, Dugard's story should remind all of us that life could always be a heck of a lot worse and that we should never take what we have for granted.

B0013FXWU6|2.0|I love Daniel Day Lewis in almost every movie that he has been in.  He is my favorite living male actor.  Nevertheless, this movie was a big disappointment.  I had been looking forward to watching it for years but I found the movie tedious with me looking at my watch hoping that it was almost over for the last hour or so.  Normally I would have stopped watching a movie at the point but since Daniel Day Lewis was in it, I kept hoping that the film would improve.  It didn't.  The cinematography was stunning and the initial part of the movie depicting the early oil industry was fascinating.  However, as the movie continued into the eventual mental and moral decline of Plainview (Lewis), it lost me.  The final hour of the movie seemed to be a series of vignettes with little rhyme or reason.  Frankly, I did not get it and do not understand all of the praise that this movie has received.

1594744769|3.0|This was a weird book. A fantastical story about an old man who you think is at first using words like \\"monster\\" to describe his escape from the Nazi's. He's also showing his 17 year-old grandson pictures of unusual children, and saying things like, \\"find the bird.\\" His family thinks he's crazy until the grandson goes on a journey to a remote island to discover what his grandfather was talking about. Finds a fantastical world of children with special powers who live the same day again and again, in a time loop. One of the monsters his grandfather told him about actually killed him (because he also had magical powers but didn't tell anyone) and is now hunting down the grandson. An invisible boy, a levitating girl, people turning into birds, and other weird kids, all combine to make it a weird, adventurous, scary story. One of the little girls in this time loop (real age around 85 but still looks like a child due to living the same day over and over again) was in love with the grandfather when he was also a young boy on this island, and now falls in love with his grandson  - and yes, the grandson know she's 85 and falls for her anyway. Still not sure what to think of this book!
B004LUS390|4.0|This program is wonderful and fairly intuitive for those who are used to working with layers, though with some quirks. Whenever repositioning layers it will delete anything that has gone past the work area and will sometimes insert or delete pieces that have been drawn. Saving while working on an image is not possible, you have to save it then reopen it, something I found out only after losing something when my tablet restarted itself. Otherwise this app has been great.
0439023521|3.0|Reminded me a lot of the plot of The Running Man (Arnold Schwartzenager movie from the 1980s) but with sympathetic YA characters and some engaging writing.  The book is very readable, but I think that avid readers of sci-fi and fantasy may want a little more depth and originality -- I did anyway.  There is very little \\"how we got there\\" for the society, and its not compelling.  A vastly better job is done on the family circumstances/personal background of the hero.  The flip-flopping pettiness of the evil leaders from the capital wasnt very credible, and the romance didnt feel terribly well done to me either.    Verdict:  3 1/2 stars; nice beach read that may actually make you nostalgic for The Running Man, which I havent thought about in 20 years.

B002ZG981E|5.0|Digital Copy says it expires May 6, 2011. I tried to use iTunes to download the digital copy and it didn't work. At first I was upset but then tried again with Windows Media Player and it worked. Now I would have preferred to have it on iTunes but a working copy is better than no copy at all.<br /><br />If you loved the In Treatment series on HBO, the Matrix Trilogy, Meet Joe Black, New Moon, and Ocean's Eleven you are going to LOVE this movie. This is one of those kind of movies you can watch again and again. It has a little something for everyone.
B000KJT8IG|4.0|I love this movie and I have owned it on VHS since it first came out. That copy is the copy that I have watched every year (yes I still have VHS). But I saw this year that this was out on Blu-ray so I wanted to get it because it was time to replace the VHS copy. This copy of the movie doesn't look any better than my on VHS which when you think about it is terrible. Anyone who has bought a vintage film on Blu-ray with the remaster done from the original film knows how amazing they can look. This looks like the Blu-ray was made right from the VHS copy! If you see a copy of it you will see right in the very first shot on the title screen that the stutters (jsut a little) just like old VHS tapes did. If you want the movie because you don't have it then you have no choice but if you already have a decent copy don't waste your money.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|Product works as expected. Not high quality recording but I wasn't expecting the quality of a CD. Happy that I can move tapes I cannot replace to MP3. Some of the parts are cheap and there was no power cord but it will take batteries. Pretty easy to use and has the software to copy and edit with it. The ability to edit is huge plus, I was expecting to do this through another program. Overall happy with the item.

B000LTAY1U|5.0|I am into watches.  I have several watches some really high end watches and some middle of the road.  This watch looks, and feels great.  I am impressed with how accurate it is for a self winding, automatic.  The adjustments for the day and date and independent and intuitive.  With all of the above and the super value price below $100, I couldn't help but give a 5 star rating.  I thought I might be getting a chincy whatch (even though it is a Seiko)  becuase the price was so low for a self winder.  Pleased to say I am verry happy with my purchase, and would definetely reccomend to anyone looking for something a little different with classic styling
0807014273|5.0|This book is a powerhouse of emotion, insight and revelation. I have watched films and heard accounts of the holocaust but never read such a matter of fact detailed account written by a survivor. Although painful to read, the insights are so beautiful and clear and hopeful that one is able to benefit from the pain of experiencing his horrific ordeal. Perhaps not in spite of it but because of it. Viktor Frankl is a giant among men (humans) and stands as an example to us all that nothing can happen to us that we cannot choose to react to.  A book that everyone should read to get a perspective on themselves and an understanding and guideline for perceiving their lives.

Cut the Rope is my most used app on my Kindle, and with good reason. I love feeding candy to the cute little monster, and it's a brainteaser type game to boot.  You won't be disappointed if you choose to bring Om Nom home.

B0001KZM3O|5.0|This album has a mood, a deliberate and patient pace, that feels intimate. Because of this album's reputation, I never expected to like it. The first few listens were more quizzical and interesting than anything, to me. Then...something happened. Now I can't stop listening to this.  Some people have complained about lack of melody, which I have to vehemently disagree with.  Perhaps some people can't get past Roger Waters' almost casual voice that hovers somewhere between spoken word and singing. The feeling I get from this album is that Roger Waters didn't make this with an audience in mind. That can be good or bad depending how you look at it. I think some fans feel like the were *owed* a repeat of an earlier work, yet Waters just went ahead and made the album that was inside his head. I agree with several reviewers who noticed that it's nearly impossible to, at once, like the Wall and dislike this album as they're incredibly similar.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|I was looking for a pdf reader that will display a book the way it was meant to seen, without conversion.
B004EPZ07K|4.0|The movie itself is absolutely great! The \\"free flixster download\\" sucks though. I downloaded it and only got the first seven minutes of the movie! After 4 weeks I sent them another email and they finally responded to me. They're sending out a disk to download the movie (I guess) again. We'll see how it works. Amazon was great though, it shipped fast and they had an awesome sale on Black Friday!!
0802473156|5.0|The Five Love Languages is a quick, easy read filled with valuable information for anyone in a relationship.  I enjoyed reading about each of the five love languages and the stories Chapman tells about working with clients who fit into each categories.<br /><br />For me it became more and more clear in Chapter 9, Discovering Your Primary Love Language, what my personal love language is, but the 30 question profile at the end verified it for me (and surprised me a little, too).<br /><br />While I was reading it, I enjoyed talking with my husband about what I was reading and when I finished I suggested that he read key parts of the book. I was surprised that he read it right away. I look forward to practicing speaking each others' love languages and working toward a stronger, more loving relationship together.<br /><br />I recommend this book for anyone in a relationship, particularly married/committed couples.  Even if your relationship is solid, learning to speak your partner's love language will help you ensure it stays that way. As a mother of 3, I can't wait to read The Five Love Languages of Children next!
B005TPCQ5I|2.0|Funny dialogue, if you can hear it. Anne's British accent verges on Irish at times. Its frustrating and then sad and then sadder... If you want to cry or just feel depressed, go for it.

B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a fantastic way to read, listen to, and share God's word.  At times it can be a little buggy, but it more than compensates for it with all the great features.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I recently received the Kindle Fire and this verso'' case for Christmas and I couldn't be happier! It looks and feels even better than expected.  The case is BEAUTIFUL! It looks just like an old book. The case is soft to the touch and very comfortable to hold. I find the spine of the book especially good looking. The inside of the case is nice and will not scratch the screen.  I love this case!  It obviously FITS seeing as to I have my Kindle Fire in it now : ) it is tight but I wouldn't trust it to hold my Kindle Fire if it wasn't. I read a few bad reviews on this and I have to say they were nuts. The cover closes nicely and after some use it lays completely flat.  The straps DO go across the speakers but they do not cover them and I see no problem with sound.

B004FOA84A|2.0|I agree with the other reviews in that this game is too short.  It was fun, but I expected more for a paid app.  I hope there are more levels to come.  If not, it is a waste of money.  I wouldn't recommend this game.
B003L77G06|5.0|Wonderful show, my husband and I laugh almost constantly through each episode. So glad we bought the season to watch as many times as we want.
B005MYEPXC|3.0|How many times can Woody Allen remake the same film?  Sure, different settings and character names but essentially they all seem to involve wealthy people whining about their lives.  In this version, Woody (as Gil Pender) ruminates about how he's not living his desired artistic life and sets up the usual set of foils, from the shrew of a wife he seems to have little real affection for to her evil parents who hate him and want to kill his free spirit.  There's the requisite pseudo-intellectual nemesis who casually belittles Woody (um, I mean Gil).  Whether his films are about murder, adultery or failed careers the dynamics and character archetypes are always consistent.  If you've seen one Woody Allen film since the 80's, you've truly seen them all.<br /><br />Perhaps if you're an art and literature history buff, you may get a kick out of the portrayals of great artists of the 1920's (Hemingway, F Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Salvador Dali, etc).  For me, the beauty of Paris and the reminiscing of an imagined grander age aren't enough to carry this film.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I love to support artists with integrity whose art is expressed with such feeling and honesty!! The world could use more role models like Kelly Clarkson, who have the courage of conviction.

B005COO1X6|3.0|I was extremely disappointed with this read. It started out great but was a damper in the end.  It left you looking for more and to see when the story would actually end!
038541627X|4.0|I'm ashamed to say that this is the first Asimov I've ever read.  Somehow I slipped through life without it until now, but I'm glad I discovered him.<br /><br />Although I didn't like most of the poetry and fantasy, his science fiction is very powerful.  Most of the pieces are rather slow, but engrossing.  All very conceptual.  Not very action-oriented.  The whole of some stories involves men sitting around and talking.  I can't help thinking that my critique group would trash it for that, but I quite enjoyed it.  I would have enjoyed it more if he had cut out some of the mundane physical descriptions of characters.<br /><br />What an imagination!  His tricky issues and fascinating possibilities gave me lots to think about.  Not a book I'll forget it three months, that's for sure. It's amazing how so many of his predictions for the future were so dead right, yet he imagined computers getting bigger and bigger, until Multivac (the most powerful computer) is a mile long and three stories tall.<br /><br />The book is also a product of the times.  Most stories were written in the fifties, and a LOT of them directly or indirectly address issues of WWII, nuclear weapons, nuclear wars, etc.  A great gender inequality also shows itself.  Almost all the main characters are male.  Most of the female characters are silly, doting, 50s housewife typecasts.  Only about three of them have real minds.  Though I found this rather offensive, I also found it an interesting peek into the mindset of the 50s--or at least Asimov's 50s.<br /><br />Some of my favorite stories in the collection, in case you don't have time to read the whole thick volume:  \\"The Feeling of Power,\\" \\"The Dead Past,\\" \\"Living Space,\\" \\"Profession,\\" \\"The Gentle Vultures,\\" \\"All the Troubles in the World,\\" \\"The Ugly Little Boy,\\" \\"Nightfall,\\" and \\"Hostess.\\"
0142414999|5.0|(Originally posted at That Artsy Reader Girl. I bought my copy from a seller other than Amazon.)<br /><br />I love Christmas romances that aren't sad. The back of this book sounded happy to me, so I decided it was worth a shot, even though I don't like the idea of short stories. I like to read a book that is one big story. Not three little ones. Needless to say, this book was a gamble. JACKPOT!! Halleluiah! I LOVED IT! Gush, gush, gush. Ok, on to the review. (Clearly I don't read enough books that cause happiness to gush out of me. I'm not crazy, I promise.) Oh, and wanna know what else is fun? These three stories are all intermingled. I didn't realize this until I started in on story #2. They all take place on and around Christmas Eve in Gracetown, NC during the biggest blizzard in the last 50 years. Each story discusses different characters, who end up all being connected. I loved all of them, and want to go find everyone at The Waffle House in Gracetown now.<br /><br />The first story is called The Jubilee Express, by Maureen Johnson. I'd never read anything by her, and pretty much adore her now. Not many authors make me love them in roughly 100 pages, but I'm about to go buy more of her books! Anyway, there's a girl named Jubilee (she was named after a building in a very expensive Santa village! Hahah!) who finds herself on a train to Florida because her parents decided to be crazy this year. A big snowstorm causes the train to stop in a small town, where she finds some interesting people (and some sweet ones) in the Waffle House. Her Christmas plans end up needing a slight alteration, but I doubt anyone would feel that she suffered as a result! I loved this story. Jubilee is hilarious. The thoughts running through her head had me laughing out loud. I loved the main guy in this story too. He is so sweet and sensitive. I'm not giving away more of the plot, because you just need to read it. That is all.<br /><br />The second story is called A Cheertastic Christmas Miracle, by John Green. Oh my. It's hilarious. The main guy, Tobin, has two friends named JP (my favorite character, because he is amazing) and the Duke (Angie). While watching Bond movies, they get a call on Christmas Eve to hightail it to the Waffle House to see 14 stranded cheerleaders from the same train Jubliee was on, hanging out and being cheerleadery. Their journey to this Waffle House (in the middle of a blizzard) is priceless. It includes a lost wheel, some scary twins, a Twister mat sled, and a dangerous beer keg. I died of laughter. And of course, it turns out to be an adorable story. I want to meet JP. The things he says are hilarious, plus he was wearing Tobin's dad's baby blue ski suit for the entire story because he thought it would make him look like a hardcore skier, just back from the slopes. Gotta impress those cheerleaders! Oh, good stuff, Mr. John Green.<br /><br />The last story is called The Patron Saint of Pigs, by Lauren Myracle. This was a very \\"meh\\" read for me. Luckily it was the last story, because I don't think I would have continued with the book if it had been the first.  It's all about this girl named Addie, who I didn't care for much, who cheated on her boyfriend a week before Christmas, dumped him, and now wants him back. She spends a lot of time whining about her situation, even though it's her fault. And she spends a lot of time being mad at him for not responding to her latest apology e-mail with open arms. She CHEATED on him. Why does she expect a happy ending to this? The story also involves a little old lady who thinks she's an angel, and a quest to acquire a little teacup pig that is to be her friend's Christmas present. It was just weird, and a pretty weak way to end the book. The first two stories were brilliant, and long-lasting loves for me. This story really fell flat, and pales in comparison. The ending was also pretty cliche and unrealistic. I can look past this story, though, and rate this book 5 stars for the other two. If we factor in my rating for this one, the book would probably get a 3.5.<br /><br />I definitely see myself re-reading the first two stories a lot. They are so sweet and Christmasy, not to mention a quick dose of the Holiday spirit. I was delighted to find them.r two.

B0063GORYU|4.0|This is one of the better solitaire games I've played.  It remains challenging long after the others have worn thin, and the ads are minimal, though occasionally. irritating during the game.
1451648537|4.0|I waited for this book to come out in print. Having read his \\"Benjamin Franklin\\", I greatly anticipated \\"Steve Jobs.\\" I cannot say I was disappointed. Isaacson's style of writing always keeps me interested.  The subject of this book also added to my interest in reading it.  Mr. Jobs may have been a person who was different, condescending, at times, abusive, brilliant,  focused: but in my opinion, a true visonary in every sense of the word.  It is a a fascinating true tale of someone both puzzling and extraordinary. Just talk to Steve Wozniak.
B0025UHKNS|1.0|I bought this runner's watch as a Christmas gift for my daughter.  She was beyond thrilled!  But imagine our disappointment when she opened the box and learned that it would not work at all.  She called the Garmin 800 number and they determined that the watch must be defective and have offered her a replacement.  It cost us $20.94 to FedEx it back to the company.
0393061434|4.0|I'm glad Steve Wozniak decided to tell his own story. The book is a great enjoyable read, with no need to have an engineering or computer science background.  He spoke of his early years and the support and counsel of his father which appears to have had a major impact on him and how he \\"evolved\\" through life. He speaks of the excitement he felt   with each and every step......   Yes, I would say he really did \\"invent\\" the first real personal computer for the masses.  I enjoyed \\"spending the time with him\\".
B004X60QE2|5.0|Have wanted this for a while, and as you know the series can be costly. I could not believe how good the price was,love the dvd. I will definetly be shopping at Amazon.com more.

I get lost and confused but i still like the story and his world. But (back to the point) has anybody heard of the saying \\" calm before the storm.\\" Because that what i think what going to happen (If not please watch the perfact storm).
0307279189|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a runner friend. I suffered a knee injury during the Phila Half marathon, and this book helped me through the mental block. After realizing I wouldn't make my PR, I focused on a quote from this book, \\"You're not going  to win. No matter what you do, you're going to be out there all day. So you might as well just relax, take your time, and ENJOY it. Keep this in mind-if it feels like work, you're working too hard\\" Recommend this book to any runner.

B006NXIO0Q|2.0|This movie was a big disappointment.  Zoe Saldana is great to look at but anyone with a brain is going to get bored of that real quickly unless there's some substance to back it up.  This movie had none - very little character development, weak fight scene choreography, no story continuity. I couldn't wait for the movie to finish.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I stayed up all night reading this book because I could not put it down.  The story draws you from the very beginning and at the end I found myself wanting more to read.  Not enough words to describe how incredibly well-written this book is...you just have to read it for yourself!!!
B001RP1G0U|1.0|Horrific.  The only reason I sat through it is because my kitty cat was holding me down with extreme cuteness and cuddling.  Horrible script, non-existent direction, acting?  What acting?  I loved Diane Lane in Under the Tuscan Sun, but I'm afraid she gave that movie everything she had and the only thing left for succeeding movies is the left-overs.  Don't waste your time and money.  P.S.  I've never written a review for anything ever before, the horribleness of this movie drove me to it.  P.S.S  why isn't there a \\"no-star\\" option?
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is fun but sometimes it like glitches this game can be fun like the sushi game were u need to get the sushi on the stick

B005I6EU48|3.0|I mostly like it because I need my kindle to feel like a book, but it isn't leather and has an awful plastic smell that is taking a long time to dissipate. I would like it better if it was leather and didn't smell bad. Other than that it's OK.

B003YCOIFY|5.0|This semi-realistic mini-series has you pulling for the characters the whole way through.  While not particularly 'accurate' as a historical documentary, it's not really meant to be.  It's a drama and it's meant to invoke feelings about a 'band of brothers'.  Which it does masterfully.  From what I've seen and read, it basically pulls the experiences of several people together into a single character.  More bang for the buck as it were.  Most people who give this series a bad review seemed to expect a historically accurate film, but forget that it's not a documentary film.  This film does just what Hanks and (Speilberg?) wanted it to.  It tells a story.  And it's a very good one.  Buy this.  It's well worth watching over and over.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Fun and creative. Kids love it! Can you make the candy monster dressable by kids? Thanks for this great game.

Nothing to say about the story, you probably know it or at least might have some idea, it will keep you trapped in your home making you keep watching and watching episodes!!

0143145150|5.0|The Grapes of Wrath is a classic and needs no further critique from me.  Although set in the thirties, it still resonates today -- perhaps more than it did ten or fifteen years ago, given the current economic and political situation.  The reading by Dylan Baker is great; no phony Oakie accents, no trying to sound like a woman or little kid, but still each character comes across as an individual.  I couldn't ask for a better vocal interpretation of the written words.
B006G2ZEV6|4.0|great game. great concept. great execution. but bug were no words are present despite subtitles makes it hard to play sometimes so I will have to only give it 4 stars
B00631VJIC|5.0|Not only is the show amazing, but so is the soundtrack! if I could personally talk to Mr. Sutter, I'd beg for a second one with a list a songs too! He has an incredible ability to pick the perfect music for the scenes in the show. It just makes me want MORE!!! WELL DONE! A MUST HAVE FOR A TRUE SONS FAN!!
B005O30Y5Y|5.0|We really enjoyed this last movie in the Harry Potter series (but the books were still better!). The BlueRay version was very good. We also liked the option to watch it via streaming until it was shipped to us!
B0063IH60K|4.0|This is a nice app of the standby boredom buster. Requisite ads pop up at the beginning of games. On the Fire version, the tame goggles between portrait and landscape orientation.
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is super fun!It works well on my kindle fire and loads quickly.A lot of people say all you do us slice fruit ,which is true but you can also unlock stuff and there are 3 different modes to play so you almost never get bored! I highly reccomend this app.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Loved this game so much that as soon as the second (Quell: reflect) game became available I bought that one too.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|The cover is really pretty and very sturdy.  Other reviewers commented that the fit was too tight but I think it's perfect, I had no trouble fitting my fire in.  The cover doesn't lie flat at first but that's just because it's leather, after some use it will be fine!
B002UXRGM0|5.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas because we are big Planet Earth fans and we have enjoyed this series as well. I love how this series really goes into detail on some animals (some we saw on Planet Earth and some are all new)! The Blu-ray is very clear and the colors really pop. It is very informative and it is definitely something that we will watch many times.
1932907009|5.0|As always Amazon has been one of the most reliable sites to order things from.  This product was in wonderful condition used just as it stated. Thankyou so much to amazon for giving people a peace of mind when it comes to online orders and for amazing prices.  And to Blake Snyder, this book will literally bring you out of a bad mood!  It truly lays it out for you in black and white.  This really is the last book you will ever need on screenwriting.  -WooDy
B005HSG3TC|4.0|This is a very nice, simple, but good-looking cover. It has nice feel: not to slippy, not too sticky. It fits snugly around my Kindle Fire and does not add much weight or bulk. The cover folded back easily into a stand for the device and that is its best feature. The edges are a bit sharp for holding the device in hand in portrait orientation, but then the Kindle Fire is a bit heavy for doing that. A good buy.<br /><br />As of July 2012, still working well. Elastic band is showing some signs of wear (beading, somewhat looser), but that is minor in comparison. Still a good buy.
B0063IH60K|5.0|fun game easy to move the cards around. no need to drag the cards just tap the card you want and it goes to the open space available. even with a chain of cards just tap the top card and they all go. when you have won the game it asks if you want all the cards to go automatically to the ace pile.
B000056NX5|1.0|This one had poor acting, poor singing, etc by Jesus and Judas.  There will never be anyone who can portray Jesus like TED NEELEY.  I have seen him many times in the stage production and also the movie.  There is no one with his passion, dedication to the role, awesome and untouchable voice.  You have to make people take the journey with you which is what Ted Neeley does.  Never remake a classic version.
B005Y4241K|1.0|Love Adele, saw her live and thoroughly enjoyed this concert. But I'm disappointed to say I can't recommend the edited version for family viewing.   In addition to her incredible voice and songwriting talents, Adele has an amazing stage presence- one of the best ever. She has the rare ability to connect with her audience and make you feel like it truly is just the two of you, alone, having a chat and some tea in her living room. She connects to the level I've only seen before in a Paul McCartney or Bruce Springsteen.   But regretably, she has a very filthy mouth in person. It's who she is, and part of her background and her very charismatic personality. But as engaging as she is live, I'm really happy we didn't take our two young daughters to her concert. Every other word between songs is an F-bomb, which is fine for adults, but she has a huge cross-generational fan base, and I hope she grows enough to realize that this is in poor taste, not appropriate for her younger fan base, and that she's hurting her career and reputation with such filthy language live.   Bought this edited version DVD for our daughters for Christmas so they could see her as close to live as possible. Sadly, the editing job was very poor, and you could basically still hear every F this and F that. They also didn't blur her hands when she flips off her old boyfriend with both hands before one song about him. In sum, don't buy this if you have kids.  Beyond that problem, the concert is OK but not great. Her voice was noticably ragged. Don't get me wrong. Even damaged, she's still better than 99% of the artists out there today, but she was clearly having troubles by this time, and canceled the rest of her tour a few days later.  We saw her a month earlier in Seattle and her voice was in much better shape then.  The band is very strong, and the sound and production values are high. Worth getting if you haven't seen her live. Just don't watch either the unedited or edited version with your kids!
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I fell in love with this book before the end of the first chapter. I read it in one day, I just couldn't seem to put it down. Honestly one of the best love stories ive ever read and one of the best books ive ever read.   MUST READ!!

Hollywood's CGI chops are prodigious; we've come a long way from Roddy McDowell's crazy rubber mask.  But I confess it felt a bit sterile at times. Clearly someone wrote a new algorithm for breaking glass, so they had to use it over and over. And over. We should conclude that, in addition to getting high-octane brains, the new and improved apes are also made of Kevlar. Those chimps exploded through more glass than a Lawrence Kasdan saloon brawl. But we're all cheering for our newly enlightened cousins, even though we know they'll be hunting us for sport and tearing down Lady Liberty within a few generations. This is a roar of a good time.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|\\"My Week With Marilyn\\" gives us a glimpse into a world we can only imagine, shared with people we only know as legends, through the eyes of a young man who knew he didn't belong but desperately wanted to and, through pluck and luck, found himself hobnobbing with cinema's elite. The film cannily establishes this young man as our sympathetic and amusing hero before granting us entree into the world of his and our dreams. The light humor remains through the film but parts occasionally to let us experience the heartbreaking insecurity and desperation of one of cinemas most revered stars as well as the devastation that fell on those she touched.   Michelle Williams' portrayal of Marilyn is a wonder.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|The Murray River in Australia is suffering the same fate as the Colorado - over allocation of a scarce resource. The Grand Canyon in 3D is an excellent documentary - even better than one gets by being there!!
B003Y5H5HO|4.0|My experience of the American film version of [[ASIN:0307949486 The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo]] can't help but be influenced by the powerful experience of the earlier Swedish film. There is much to recommend each. There are choices in each film that I prefer over the other.   David Fincher's American film is more slickly and confidently made but, perhaps because the story was familiar already, had less of an emotional impact that the rougher and rawer Swedish film. The American version of the investigation seemed too easy and, as good an actor as he is, Daniel Craig just carries too great an aura of physical competence to convincingly portray Mikael Blomkvist.   Rooney Mara's Lisbeth Salander is distinct from but just as good as Noomi Rapace's. We experience less of Lisbeth Salander's world in the American film, mostly to the detriment of my investment in her story, but Fincher and Co. do leave out some information which was shoehorned into the Swedish film from later books in the series which was probably better left for later. Good call on that.   And the American film has Stellan Skarsgård; always a good thing. Still, I think my preference falls to the Swedish [[ASIN:B003TTWJJO The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo]]. Or better yet, I can just mash them up in my imagination and have the best of both.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really. Enjoy. Playing. This game it keeps me occupied.  I can play it all day long.  On a scale on one to ten. I give. It a ten.
B005DCJ1J6|5.0|This is one of my favorite books so I was curious how it would follow the book. The movie did a great job of telling the story and the acting by the stars was terrific!
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy, fast. I can spend hrs playing this. few ads come up. but do not interrupt at all. love it love it!
B002KSPKRS|5.0|Shipping came 4 days early which made me happy!  The sound quality of the headphones is amazing. When you play call of duty you can hear all the sounds in depth. The surround sound is fantastic and simulates directions really well.  Overall I'm really impressed with this and I'm happy I got it.  Recommend it to everybody else! PERFECT.  Also regarding static and interference, I don't get any. My wireless router is really close to my xbox and headset transmitter but I don't get any popping or interference.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I've always been a huge fan but have never bought a CD in years, but just tired of the media. It's slanted and truly felt horrible to see you get lambasted. Honestly checked out the CD and now a big fan. I know that you have taken allot of flack but applaud the courage to say your feelings. Ron Paul's message is an amazing one and to someone that feels like the debts of the world are crushing me everyday, it's been very nice to hear someone with solutions or at least believe in someone. Giving your CD a 5 because I like it and glad to see that something good comes from the horribly mean things that were said on Twitter.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Great CD - Buble really hit the mark with this one!! Very happy with it and the service from Amazon!!  Will continue to use for future purchases!!
1594744769|3.0|I'm half way through - enjoying the story so far - it's just another teen fiction read, however I am entirely unimpressed with the Author's depiction of Wales and the mannerisms of the Welsh characters. For example, a common phrase in the UK is \\"taking the piss\\", which refers to 'joking' - unfortunately, the Author has got the wrong end of the stick and writes \\"taking a piss\\", which is the act of urination (unless this is a kindle misprint, which seems unlikely). Similarly, his Welsh characters use the most American slang, and completely fail to appear even stereotypically Welsh - I have yet to see a \\"boyo\\" or a Jones or a Gwyn/Bryn. He could even have made it a bit more believable by throwing in some words in Cymraeg (the Welsh language).<br /><br />I picture Ynys Llanddwyn as the island. As it stands, Rigg's island and it's inhabitants are entirely unconvincing for me.<br /><br />Also, I'm not even from Wales.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Not bad on the Kindle Fire a little lag mid plaay but not enough to stop playing. over all I'd give it a solid four stars

0439023483|5.0|I read all three books in 2 days, just couldn't put it down even when it got so ugly I cried. It was amazing and the twists kept me guessing. One of the best survival stories I've ever read. Bravo!

B0037UUZQY|4.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift for the daughter of a friend.  I also purchased the little tin purse and she had a wonderful Christmas.  She loves the hair extension.
1451648537|5.0|I cant wait to read this book. I have flicked through and it looks extremely interesting. With two little children it might be a while before I get to read it. It's on top of my reading list.
B001RIY4WE|5.0|I watched this flick as a child in 1992. 19 years later I bought this HD version and it just bring back the nostalgic value + the best AV experience ever! The clarity of the 20 year old film is just phenomenon. The start up screen as you load the Blu Ray show skynet loading requesting for internet access. You can press cancel to proceed to the main menu.   The main menu screen is very cool... showing the part structure of the T101 model. The T2 theme is playing in the background. Very cool menu indeed as there is beeping sound as you navigate through the menu. You can choose to play the theatrical release or the extended version.   The clarity of the image is superb. The DTS Master 6.1 soundtrack blow me away throughout the movie. The shotgun sound pumps away with my subwoofer pounding shot after shot. Rear surround is active and always keeping me on the edge of the seat. DAMN... I never enjoyed T2 so much before this.   Overall, it is a good buy for whoever that have not gotten any DVD or Blu Ray edition. I have read many reviews indicating too many re-release of this classic flick. I have not seen the rest but this really kick ass on my Onkyo surround system & Samsung LCD TV. This review does not include the extras as there are too many and yet to go through them yet, but they look good and hoping to go through every one of them during weekend! One of my BD best buy in 2011! Good bargain from Amazon and super fast shipping to Malaysia in 5 days time with standard shipping! Happy New Year everyone!
0439023513|3.0|I talk of the last 50 or so pages and my general view on what I think as I encounter it, so if don't want spoilers it's best off you leave now.  So I was finishing up this book (around pg 350) and I just HAVE to say something! So Katniss gets hit by fire bombs and goes unconscious. Loveable characters die in a way that adds on nothing to the story! But the worst thing about it is the ending. It's just: Katniss gets hit by bombs, wakes up to the victory. Nothing in the victor involves her at this point! Suzanne Collins seemed to rush this ending. I've read the Harry Potter series a couple times over and the 7th book was epic. Similar to this book, the main characters are \\"camping\\" in a way and trying their best to hide from the enemy (in this book the Capital), but in the ending Harry has an epic battle against Voldemort and it's dramatic. In this book, Katniss has no epic battle (though I have to give credit, the \\"camping\\" and fighting over the mutts was a great part). Disappointing.  However, to Collin's credit, I think that the idea of have a reverse-Hunger Games against the Capital works great. If you Google \\"Mark Reads Mockingjay Chapter 26\\" you'll find that he is in emotional agony over these events. I, however, find this turn of events to be nothing more then delightful. Yes, I've come to realization that I'm a cruel person with little sympathy, but hey, this would make for an interesting games.   The \\"execution\\" of Snow is a turn of events. I was so pumped into his death that I actually omitted the whole line: \\"The point of my arrow shifts upward. I released the string. And President Coin collapses over the side of the balcony and plunges to the ground.\\" I thought Snow was dead. I found my mistake soon afterwards and truly realized that Katniss decided that it was the rebel's fault of Prim's death. Reading it in both views truly helps your understand the effect of it all. When Katniss get's thrown into the cell for weeks it's kinda strange. When Haymitch finally comes in telling her that her trial is over, it reminded me of Death Note (watch it around episode 14-15 if your don't get the reference).  I could give more on my synopsis, but I think is enough for one review. In other words, this book isn't bad, but I just doesn't live up to the expectations of the building action of the last two books.  Oh yeah, and by the way, she picks Peeta.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Love the movies of course, but I'm glad I waited to buy it as a set. Much cheaper and all 8 discs fit in a box that would normally only hold 2. Costs nearly twice as much at Target, too. No bonus materials or booklets but all I really wanted were the films and for the price this is perfect!
B006G2ZEV6|5.0|This game works fantastically on touch devices. It was fun on PC but even better on Mg Kindle Fire. Can't recommend it enough.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I have always liked kelly Clarkson but never owned a cd of hers. I probably wouldnt have bought this except for the fact that she is taking a lot of flak for endorsing Ron Paul. I want to show some support. I know I'm not the only one grateful for anyone willing to take some heat for caring about the fate of our wonderful country that has fallen into the hands of madmen.  Thanks Kelly.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it! I am addicted to playing this game. Thanks for many hours of fun on my kindle fire this Christmas season.

B00425S1H8|5.0|I'm in the comercial A/V industry and need a serial port for many products I service. This Product (Plugable USB to RS-232 DB9 Serial Adapter (Prolific PL2303HX Chipset) allowed me to retire my 9yr old Dell laptop that served me well but I needed something lighter, faster and less embarrassing to use in front of a client. I havent found any new laptops equiped with a serial port anymore. This product even though its not as convenient as a onboard serial port worked well and best of all it was not expensive. :)
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I use this app to do my daily devotions.  Can't live without it!  Considering taking it to church in lieu of my hard copy of the Bible.  I just don't want my pastor to think I'm playing video games during his message!  :-)
B006C1DH92|5.0|This game is so addictive! I love it! My intent was to try it out for a few minutes just to see if I'd like it and I ended up playing for hours.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This game is great. It's very seamless and entertaining. So far I haven't encountered any glitches while playing. If this were a paid app, I'd buy it. Great job.
B003Y5H54W|3.0|Got it on time but the price was a little high because Walmart sold it for cheaper and brand new.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|This book is a true classic and a great read around Christmas time - and any other time, for that matter.<br /><br />How a bitter old man is led into situations he never expected, all in the hope that he would change his ways. Charles Dickens shows an interesting perspective in this book and makes readers take a step back to look at themselves. Readers will compare themselves to Scrooge and try to change their ways, just as he does. It is an interesting perspective and a great way to spread the word about holiday spirit.<br /><br />After all, who doesn't have at least one Scrooge in the family?<br /><br />Anyone looking for an inspiring Christmas read; this book is for you. The writing may be old, but the spirit is still new and fresh!<br /><br />As an enjoyable little read, I don't see why anyone wouldn't want to take a chance with it. Let yourself be drawn into Scrooge's tale, and live what he lives. Only then will you find the true meaning of Christmas spirit.
B003L77GRO|5.0|When I first started watching Dexter I wanted to stop because Dexter was a little too creepy for me. However I'm glad that the first 3 episodes hooked me in because this is easily my favorite show on TV. Season 5 stars Julia Stiles and is my second favorite season (behind season 2 The Bay Harbor Butcher Season). Anyone that has not yet seen this show or this season it is a MUST HAVE!!! I'm glad that the writers hooked me because now I can't stop watching Dexter!
0064407667|4.0|The Bad Beginning is the first of thirteen books that combine to make A Series of Unfortunate Events. Written by Lemony Snicket, this series is commonly praised and adored, yet has its fair share of critics.<br /><br />These books were written in a style that will either work for readers, or it won't. As with any book, a lot relies on the style. For me, I found the style to be intriguing, sometimes witty, and enjoyed Snicket's ways of interpreting words and how the youngest of the Baudelaire's, Sunny, spoke.<br /><br />The series follow the three Baudelaire children, Violet, Klaus and Sunny, as they journey from place to place and are forced into many horrible situations that they must try to escape from.<br /><br />The three children combine what they are best at (inventing, researching, and biting) to run from whatever their third cousin four times removed (or was he their fourth cousin three times removed?) throws at them. That's not to say that he is their only problem, but he is the core of most of the unfortunate events that plague them.<br /><br />Admittedly, there are sections where repetitive explanations dull the impact of the book and push readers out of the story. Still, Snicket did well in drawing readers back in and despite the small imperfections in writing and pacing, it is an enjoyable book and I have no problem recommending it, and the other twelve, to readers looking for a good series that strays from the norm and offers a different view on things than most books do.<br /><br />The characters are charming and readers will find themselves drawn to the three children - each with their own personality. The Baudelaire's are as close and can be and it helps readers feel what they feel, and endure the trials and torment this family is put through.<br /><br />Anyone looking for a unique style and hours of reading pleasure; this series may be for you.
0439023491|5.0|This book was the best book ever.<br />It has it's twists and turns, great moments and sad moments<br />It shocks you in what suzanne Collins writes<br />the series is better than any other books i have ever read.<br />Suzanne Collins in brilliant.<br />Best book in the entire world<br />I couldnt put it down even when i was done reading it!
0064410935|5.0|What is there to say about Charlotte's Web?<br /><br />Throughout my childhood, this was one of my favorite books to read. This story of friendship, trial, and love is sure to warm anyone's heart. Despite the sad depth that hides within these pages, the heartwarming friendship shines brighter and makes for a pleasurable read.<br /><br />Charlotte and Wilbur's relationship together is realistic and helps draw readers into the story. While there are hardships and it can't be said that everything has a happy ending, this book has an ending that will leave readers satisfied.<br /><br />Not just a kid's story, this book shows deeper aspects of life. The fight for friendship, the circle of life, and the fact that not all things are as they seem.<br /><br />A true classic, I recommend this book to everyone who enjoys reading - and anyone who doesn't!
B005N95JA4|5.0|I already own a vinyl copy of this album, but when I saw that bonus tracks were included, I couldn't resist!  I am VERY happy I made this part of my collection!  It's always nice when Mick & Keith write new material, but to hear previously unreleased recordings helps us remember what a terrific band they've always been!  The bonus tracks remind us all of the boys' love of the blues.  This bonus material is a MUST for anyone who follows the Stones!
0307474275|5.0|I had never enjoyed reading until reading this book. I am now an addict.<br />this book uses some history and famous land marks to tell a great story and get your conspiracy theroy. Wheels rolling.
B004EPYZPS|5.0|This was Spielberg at this best. This was a very fast paced mysterious plot that left you on the edge of your seat.Best of all though were the portrayals by the young actors, and the way they interact with each other to keep the plot moving. It has a lot of shock and surprises, and be sure to watch the trailer at the end. Super 8 is destined to become another Spielberg classic.
0782008372|2.0|I love this movie.  I used to own it on VHS and it was great.    Something is wrong with the audio when Republic Pictures transferred it to DVD.  Sometimes, the dialog is so soft it can barely be heard through the TV. If I turn the volume up to max on my TV, I can then hear the quiet scenes.  Then the I get blasted when the next scene starts.  It is a very difficult and frustrating version to watch.  As a caveat, I only used my TV speakers to watch the video.  It is possible that a good home theater system with surround will play fine.
B004LROMSO|5.0|Eve Green definitely at her best. She alone carries the entire series. She showcases all of her best moves, from sinester, coniving, to seductress. Definitely worth seeing.
1572814349|5.0|This is a beautiful deck with gold gilt edges and the pictures are based on medieval paintings.  The book of explanations helps one to find all the aspects of a picture to help with a reading.

B005EHQGTS|4.0|Pretty good. Drops connection unexpectedly sometimes, but just mildly irritating. Worth having, but not perfect. Was fairly easy to set up as well.
B0033AI48Y|5.0|It's a great era movie that's beautifully filmed and at times, will momentarily make you forget the gravity of the situation.  Instead, you just feel the love and earnest of a father caring for his son, so that the son will hang onto the belief that life is still good for as long as possible.

B0036EH3UC|2.0|I just went through the entire box set and Razor was not in the box.  There was a case that had the Razor cover but when I opened it there was only a season 4 disc and no Razor. When I went through the rest of the box set I found The Plan randomly sitting in a season 4 disc case but still no Razor disc.
B0063GORYU|5.0|very good, very fun. keeps me entertained for hours. love all the features and the classic spider feel for.the game.
B005KELQEU|5.0|This \\"sleeve\\" is eactly what I wanted! The definition of a technology sleeve is a cover that is more of a pouch than anything else, so do NOT expect anymore, because the case is only meant to protect the device when it is NOT in use. I decided that I wanted a sleeve after reading many of the reviews for more \\"typical\\" case for the Kindle Touch; from what I could see, none of them fit well yet. So, I will wait it out and get a different cover after more have been made and I will always have this one to fall back on if needed. The case itself fits exactly how I wanted it to fit: it is tight, but not so tight that I am afraid that I will damage the device when putting it on. It is also thicker than I expected (and a little extra protection never hurt). The botton line is: if you are looking for a simple cover to protect your Kindle Touch when it is NOT in use, this is perfect for you!
B005K17RU0|3.0|nice app but tends to crash frequently. better than the weather channel app for android.  wish it wouldn't crash so often.
B005XE33FM|5.0|everyone should have this! this is one, if not the, best acoustic album's of all time.  the quality of the recording is great. the cover design is very nice.  in the end this is a great record. and after his last horrible pop album chris is back and doing what he does best, emotional singing, songs that tear your heart open.  from the first to the last track chris cornel give old song new arrangements and sing them as only he knows. chris goes to all of the points in his amazing career, from the early grunge era with temple of the dog(the amazing version of \\"call me a dog\\") and soundgurden( \\"black hole sun\\", like you didn't guess), to his time with rage against the machine former band mates in audioslave (\\"wide awake\\"=amazing ) to his solo career (even the pop) and even give us a couple of new songs(\\"cleaning my gun\\" and \\"the keeper\\").  welcome back chris.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldnt put ths book down for one second ! Very popular and entertaining story line. Also well put together twists . Enjoyed every second of reading the bloody love story. Hope theres more to come from this wonderful author &#34;Suzanne Collins&#34;.
B003YOMNCM|3.0|To start on a positive note, I liked the violin part in the Higdon Concerto, as well as Hahn's playing of it. Where I had more trouble was with how the orchestra related to the violin.<br /><br />The first movement begins with the violin accompanied with notes here and there from various instruments, but not obviously related to what the violin is playing. There are several outbursts by the orchestra, as well as long stretches where the violin plays unaccompanied. I almost had the sense of a violinist and an orchestra sharing a stage, but not playing together.<br /><br />The second movement is a bit better, with stretches where a few instruments actually seem to be playing along with the violin. But still there are orchestral outbursts. In the third movement there are places where the whole orchestra seems to be engaged with the violin, but by then it's too little, too late. Unless the solo instrument and the orchestra seem somehow engaged you don't really have a concerto.<br /><br />My thought after my first listening, reinforced by a second listening, was that violin part could form the basis for a nice sonata. But the composer failed to make a concerto out of it.<br /><br />The Tchaikovsky is pleasant and well played, but not reason enough to buy this album.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|so far I have enjoyed these little mini games. some are easy and some more challenging but overall they are fun to.play...
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Actually arrived before my fire.  Was easy to install on the fire - it only goes on one way.  Provides a degree of protection without adding a lot of weight or bulk.  As useful as some of the more expensive ones.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|l love this app. It's so easy to use and you literally  have every translation right at you fingertips. It makes my daily devotion's go by so quickly.
0307959856|3.0|I had high hopes when I heard that P.D. James was writing a Pride and Prejudice themed mystery novel.  It started out great, but as the book wore on it became a slow-paced, rather trite read, especially the end. I expected better.  Some of the situations stretched the imagination.  One small criticism is that Jane Austen actually told some relatives of what happened to other characters in Pride and Prejudice: Mary married a clerk in her lawyer uncle's office in Meryton and Kitty married a clergyman! The author should have come across this in her research.  I give it three stars because so many Austen \\"sequels\\" are dreadful; this was slightly better.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|Great Quality awesome Sound :) I would recommend this DVD if you like Musicals this one is the right one.

B005URRCNQ|4.0|The Black Keys may have released THE Rock album of the year with the well oiled machine that is \\"El Camino\\".  The 11 tracks are mostly Rock & Roll raveups, with catchy sing along choruses that stick in your head.  Their last album, the excellent \\"Brothers\\" combined this approach along with soulful ballads and midtempo tracks.  This time around they are aiming for the rafters with a consise and focused album, which is also their most commercial album to date.  But this is not a bad thing, as they have not sacrificed any of the clever lyrics and great melodies that have put them at the forefront of current Rock & Roll.  The soul influence is also firmly intact with the 'Motown meets Spector' Danger Mouse touch on songs like \\"Dead & Gone\\" and \\"Sister\\", and the classic \\"Stop Stop\\".  Songs like these balance the albums anthemic ravers. The Rock & Roll ravers are the real meat and heart of this great album.  \\"Lonely Boy\\", \\"Money Maker\\" and especially \\"Gold On The Ceiling\\" are lighter-raising classics of the highest order.  I mean, how many bands are making Rock & Roll party records like this anymore?  Producer Danger Mouse has managed to keep the grit and edge on this record.  My only complaint (and it's minor) is he murks up Dan Auerbach's vocals on too many tracks.  What he does do brillantly is coax many tones and shades from Dan's guitar. Patrick Carney's drums are at times snappy, then thunderingly loud, but solid as rock throughout.  I think Danger Mouse is looking to create his own Wall Of Sound, and The Keys are the perfect band to realise this vision with.  Hopefully their collaboration will continue.  The vinyl pressing is excellent, and the inclusion of the CD is very nice.  Like their last album, it comes with a cool poster.  Is this 1975?

B0063GORYU|5.0|i can't stop playing this game.  i haven't played in years and i am glad to have found this app.  absolutely addictive.
B005ANZN3Q|3.0|Much of the playing is excellent, and all of it is technically dazzling, although some of it justifies the appellation \\"Bang Bang\\" that has been given to this artist by some skeptics. However, the arrangement that Lang Lang plays of the \\"Rakoczy March\\" is clearly copied from the one created and recorded by the late Vladimir Horowitz, to whom no credit is given in the album listing. I hope someone corrects this omission as quickly as possible.  The visual presentation of the recital is distracting; the \\"music video\\" repeat is a waste of disc space. The documentary portion seems designed to show the artist's self-absorbed and inconsiderate side. I can't imagine why such material would be included on a disc that's sold to his fans.
1451627289|1.0|I'm not a life-long Stephen King fan. I find that I really love some of his stuff and think other stuff is not what I was expecting. For example, I really loved The Green Mile. This book...not so much.  There were so many times when he would stop the flow of the story to \\"prove\\" the validity of his narrative, constantly talking about how \\"truth is stranger than fiction,\\" double explaining how it was possible that he could know certain things or people, and setting up lengthy (and unnecessary) scenes that support minor later details. I couldn't decide if these expositions were King being boldly self-aware or obnoxiously self-aggrandizing (as in \\"OBVIOUSLY I'm the only one who can write fiction that claims to be real but aware that it is fiction!\\"). Several times, he killed my suspended disbelief as well as the reading flow by doing this and that made it worse. I'm willing to give an author some leeway. Not everything needs to be explained to the minutest detail. There came a point where I began skipping through entire sections because I was trying to figure out how they were relevant.   And then, about 550 pages in, it occured to me. JFK's assassination is not the point of the book. The half cracked romance is. It would've been better if he'd titled the book something more pertinent to the theme...like \\"Romance Across Ages...oh, and a president.\\"   Moreover, the book dragged on and on until the last fifty pages where he inserted characters that had no explanation (where the heck did the color coated time-police come from?) and then summed up the changes to the present (made by meddling with the past) as armaggedon. Because that is OBVIOUSLY the ONLY conclusion that we could've jumped to here.   As long as the reader KNOWS going into this book that the plot against JFK is a sub-plot and not the point, they might not feel duped.   As for me, all of the above issues and the twice-a-page references to the \\"harmonic\\", \\"obdurate\\" past made me want to make \\"poundcake\\" out of this book.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|I love this album and have found that even after multiple listens it is quite impressive. It's my favorite album to work to, drive to, and just plain old enjoy. I recommend this one for you too!
B0049GYXDG|5.0|Product was great, exactly what I expected. I would buy from them again. Movie was blu ray and dvd combo which is what I wanted for the price
0439023521|4.0|This is a great, entertaining book.  The Hunger Games concept is chilling and you have to keep reading because, even though you suspect how it might turn out, I want to know for sure how it comes to a completion. The book lost a star for me in the third part of the novel, where the scenes in the cave seemed to drag a little bit.  I found Peeta to be annoying and not a romantic character at all, and really couldn't root for him to live or die, was just kind of meh about him.  Was not into the appearance of the Muttants at the end, too similar to those dumb werewolves in Twilight and I just want a book to be original nowadays and have NO wolves or vampires used to wrap up a plot.  I was very interested to see how Cato and Katniss would fight it out and I felt cheated of a more interesting face-off between them.  Otherwise, Collins did a great job of creating a fictional nightmare of survival that kept me turning the pages.
B004SEUJVO|5.0|This was on my son's wish list for Christmas. Was a Hit. Quick delivery, Product in great condition. Easy shopping with Anazon.
B004SBX112|4.0|I love all Angry Birds, and I do enjoy Angry Birds Seasons, but I have a Kindle Fire, and when I updated the app to the Holiday 2011 version, I received all the new levels, but the cover of the app is still the the angry bird in the green background with twigs. Not the angry bird in the snow.
B001U3ZMHW|4.0|Ordered this twice ( the first one arrived soaking wet and was returned) as a Christmas present for my 10 year old who is very fond of building. It evokes creativity and dexterity of both the mind and hands.
B005HSL626|5.0|really good. love the sound affects and the changing of the blade. if you want to get rid of the adds just turn off the wifi.
B000002GXS|5.0|This album reminds me of the gritty 70's, as much as I want to forget that era... his sound paints it in my mind with all the goodness that was there.  This is perfect music when you have a glass of whiskey, and a quiet night... or in my case something to put onto the stereo as I'm driving home from work.  It eases your tensions, and lets you feel his soul.  He has so many styles, characters, and song-styles in every album so this album is just one style of his many breeds.  I love this man.
B0063IH60K|5.0|My thoughts on this entertaining app are that its very easy to use and very adicting. Its new age spin on a classic game was refreshing.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Love it.  Recommend to buy it.  its worth the 4.99 to play without adds or having to repeat the same levels after you beat the game.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game it is probably one of.my.most played. apps if you like challenging games this is the game for you so BUY IT
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I saw The Phantom of the Opera on Broadway and fell in love with it - I mean, it's a popular show for a reason, right?<br /><br />This movie does a beautiful job of capturing that same magic and the result is a viewing experience that gives me the same thrill as the candy store used to when I was a kid.
B001SWQYGI|5.0|I ahve used this product for many months and it is still working great. The fact it comes with an AC power cord is great and it gives you 4 headphone jacks is also helpful.  The sound is great and no noise from amp
B0057A6GA6|2.0|on both my Droid X (too small) and my Toshiba Thrive because I couldn't find a way to pause the game (unlike Night of the Living Dead, but that's also what makes it more challenging) and screen seemed very sensitive to where you touch; many times it would not allow me to update or install an item and I had to frantically try to adjust the size of the screen to restore the feature (I got in such a hurry that it's possible that I tapped something and accidentally dragged it, which slightly minimized the screen but wasn't noticeable until trying to upgrade).  Otherwise, graphics are good and is fun (and slightly addictive!).
B004G25V9S|5.0|As a somewhat older progressive fan I honestly don't know what death metal is, although my understanding is that Opeth, in fact, is a death metal band.  I also understand that this 2011 release is a departure for the group - no more death metal, no more \\"cookie monster\\" vocals.<br /><br />The music alternates passages of bone crushing volume, heavily distorted electric guitar, and a thunderous rhythm section with softer sections of acoustic guitar, acoustic piano, mellotron, and (barely audible) woodwind instruments.  The closing track is an excellent example of the softer style.  Although I like the range in dynamics, I did miss melodic and harmonic development and would have liked a little more variety in meter (most of album is in common time 4/4).  I did like the gloomy feel of the album though.<br /><br />The players are all solid - I like the guitar playing and the acoustic piano playing.  The lead singer has a good voice - a baritone I think.  It is hard to imagine him doing the \\"cookie monster\\" vocal style.  One surprise was to see percussionist Alex Acuna on this record.  The guy played with Weather Report for crying out loud.  How he ended up jamming with a Swedish death metal group is beyond me.  One other interesting thing was to note that the tune Slither was dedicated to Ronnie James Dio - I can hear a lot of those influences on this track, along with Rainbow and 1970-1971 Deep Purple.<br /><br />Mixed by Steve Wilson (Porcupine Tree), the sound quality of the album is very good.  The CD comes with a nice little booklet that features black and white photos of the group in the recording studio - I thought I saw what looks like a real Hammond organ in one of the photos, although I did not see a mellotron.  The album cover art is a bit grisly, although not without its charm.<br /><br />All in all, this is a great album by an interesting group that has changed its style.  Although the music is a bit too far on the hard rock side of the equation for my taste, I can not stop playing it. Overall, I loved Heritage and look forward to the next album.I loved Heritage and look forward to the next album.
B00000DHR0|5.0|I purchased this CD through Amazon.com I highly recommend this CD to anyone who truly loves music.  I think this is one of the best CD's Celine Dion has put out.  The song: THE PRAYER where she duets with Andrea Bocelli is magnificent!!  This CD rates a 5 Star!
B005NPLXJ4|5.0|I am a Megadeth fan. I am a Lou Reed fan. This is a squirming coil thriving in this age. So far ahead of it's time, time is irrelevant.  A perfect soundtrack for Lars Von Trier's MELANCHOLIA. A downward-dog on the whole world. Magnificent. A deck of Tarot cards. You have been dealt your hand. Well....... Thrive..... NOW!!!!!
145551389X|5.0|This was a Christmas present for my daughter who is a huge fan of Lady Gaga.  She absolutely loves it.  Beautiful book at what I think was an excellent buy.  Strongly recommend for any Gaga fan.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love solitaire! great app! I get addicted quick and have a hate time stopping. love that I can play while sitting in my lazy boy!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|The bezel is easy to get used to, though I see that people using gloves might have a little trouble with it, but that's not my case since I live in pretty hot weather. Workouts are easy to create in the watch and in Garmin Connect, you can create your workouts and upload them to the watch wirelessly with the usb stick that comes in the package.  The heart rate monitor is incredibly accurate (compared it with the results of a blood pressure monitor)  Really glad I got it.
0316789720|5.0|Our granddaughters who are 8 and 6 are very artsy and they love to draw. One of the Christmas presents that they asked for was a book on learning how to draw. After reading some of the reviews I choose 6 of Ed Emberley's books: Picture Pie, Picture Pie Two, Drawing faces, Make a World, Book of Animals and Book of Faces. Needless to say that they were happy, but after working with the books they are \\"thrilled\\" with the ease of learning the fundamentals. Our granddaughter has started a sketch pad which she will be keeping to track her progress. What I have seen so far was very impressive. I would recommend these books highly and will be purchasing the rest of his series.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|wonderful!  I am very happy with what I received and the timeliness if it. I got this in plenty of time for Christmas as promised.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Like many Jane Eyre fans - and we seem to be a dedicated bunch - I was excited to see that Masterpiece Theatre had taken on this book. I was not disappointed, in fact, this was my favourite version so far. I thought Ruth Wilson really put enough heat into the role of Jane so that it wasn't a mystery why Rochester (also well acted) would find her appealing. I loved the way the settings were done and the pacing of their romance was just right. I liked it too, that finally, Wilson put some sexual heat into the story - I know Charlotte Bronte was constrained by the mores of her time, and I'm not one who reads current romance novels so that's not what I look for in this story - but let's face it - there had to be something more than interesting conversations to make Rochester willing to marry a penniless governess!<br /><br />I strong recommend this version over most others, including the new movie version. A great DVD for a winter night. [[ASIN:B000LPQ6DE Masterpiece Theatre: Jane Eyre]]
B003Y5HWGI|5.0|This was my first purchase using Amazon and I wanted the product to be brand new. The product matched the description given exactly and I was very satisfied.
B0053Q9DHW|2.0|Like so many other reviewers here, I am a huge fan of this story and have watched most of the movie and television versions. I was waiting for this one to show up at my local movie theaters but it never did, and now I know why - who would want to see it?<br /><br /> I found the settings to be very well done - the darkness that comes with gas lighting and small windows left rooms and people only half lit and that has been missed in many other versions. I also found the flash back technique interesting and a good way to tell the story.<br /><br />However, I thought the dialogue was so stilted and almost non-existent that I couldn't find enough to make me believe that an aristocrat would even notice or become entranced by a plain looking governess. The lack of dialogue also creeped me out because Rochester is in his mid 30's and Jane is 19 - without enough talk to convince me that he had found something of real substance in Jane, I had concerns of borderline pedophelia by Rochester - I mean really, why else would a middle aged man be interested in a homely teenager who only says one or two short sentences at each encounter?<br /><br />I look forward to the next version because this one just didn't work for me. [[ASIN:B0053Q9DHW Jane Eyre]]
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|We gave this album to our 3 sons (12, 10, and 6) on Christmas Day.  It's now 5 days later and I have heard the entire album at least 10 times. They love it.  They turn it up louder than I'd like, play it more often than I'd like, ... in other words they're teaching me what I did to my parents when I was young.  Excellent buy.
B0067D7Y3U|5.0|If you're a Daughtry fan I'm sure you will like this album.  He's nothing if not consistent.  Nothing ground breaking here, but it's a good listen if you like his voice.
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love this game! I love uno and now to have it on my kindle fire it's awesome! This is a must buy if your an uno fan.
B0041L2E7G|5.0|Nice sound quality,It exceed expectations! two by the price of one. It is realy a Lightweigh. The bass could be better.
B0063IH60K|5.0|it's fairly addictive. the assistance u get in the game is nice. I like the fact that the game gives the player options as far as how difficult the game can be or easy for that reason the game is great.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|This is my favorite app, its unbelievably fun, but as of now on the kindle fire there is no option to use the mighty eagle. I believe this version could use an update.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I think that Color note pad is very good for older people because it helps them insted of kids and kids can rember a lot of thinks but older cant
1440503257|1.0|Yes. I am leaving a bad review simply because there is no Butterbeer recipe. This was the very FIRST recipe I eagerly searched for. In my opinion a Harry Potter fan cook book should not have been made without a Butterbeer recipe. I really do not care if the author was concerned about copyright issues. She had a great idea and could have had a flawless cook book tribute to the Harry Potter line if she would have tried that much harder to get JK Rowling's cooperation. I also don't care if you can search up half-worthy Butterbeer recipe's online. I was hoping for a recipe from someone who was a big enough fan that they wrote a whole friggin cook book. I wanted a recipe that was tested and counted as good enough to be published.<br /><br />Aside from my personal problem with this book there are UNTESTED recipes in it also. The author openly states that they are untested. Haggis is one, and I don't care that haggis is generally considered an unsavory dish. Then the author should have sent it to someone in Scotland to test and report whether it worked and was good. It's very unprofessional and slightly dangerous for an author to include any untested recipes in a book being sent to the general public.
B005HSL626|2.0|This game is slow and every time you play a game, right after that it shows a app or anything that you can download. Another issue of mine about this game is no matte what you do, everything is slow.
0767802519|1.0|Tedious build-up according to the required formulae for addicted audiences.  Not much happens after the first massacre while the odd-balls get to know one another.
B003Y5H4Y8|5.0|Watched this last week. Never a dull moment from beginning to end! Well made, exciting, sad, happy ... tugs at just about every emotion one could have. I cannot begin to give this move a just review, it's a GREAT Movie!!! GET IT!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This cover works well and protects my Kindle Fire.  The color insures my husband doesn't grab my Kindle by mistake :-)
B006JPS1OM|4.0|Great app that keeps you using your brain. I had fun playing with my daughter as a team, she said it felt like a fun csi game.
044084116X|5.0|Although this book was written in the early 1940's, before I was born, it is still relevant today. Matters of the heart are timeless.Love,loss,  struggles to make a living, addiction and so on, are still life issues and challenges.  One can get a vivid \\"picture\\" of life in the early nineteen hundreds in Brooklyn for a young girl growing up poor- how she managed to get along and how her thoughts and feelings \\"evolved\\" as she began to grow up and face the harsh realities of life.  Ms. Smith paints a very raw and real portrait of those times-with \\"love\\"  -Very well written-Now, a cherished favorite book of mine.  I think it would make a great \\"subject\\" for a book review!
B0055SWM08|5.0|Relaxing music that lets you think.  First logic game that I haven't had to mute.  At age 65 I need  games like this to keep my ability to think outside the box.  pun intended.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|One of the best games I have ever played. Probably even better than the original.  The only bad part are the adds.
B005K17RU0|4.0|this app works  well because it is always updated for any weather condition in my location the preview at top of my phone is helpful as a quick reference
B005HSL626|5.0|I love fruit ninjas. it is one of my favorite games. I like mega jump,bakery story,restraunt story, and treasure story also!!!!!!!!!!!
B0058VW36U|5.0|Simple yet challenging!  Addicting, can't wait for more levels.  Enjoyed the latest two boxes. M m m m m candy
B002JE43O4|1.0|Product came on time and was well packaged. The DVD case was a little worn, but not a deal breaker. The real problem was disk three. It was pretty scratched up and wouldn't play. This seems to be a factory defect because the DVDs didn't seem to be opened.
B00321SMG8|5.0|I absolutely loved it!!!!  I have a newfound appreciation for just how beautiful our planet is. This documentary has a great narration and astonishing pictures.
1451627289|5.0|Great service - have not read it yet, it's put aside until things calm down but I'm sure it will be worth the wait - Than you
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very easy to get absorbed into.  Great mindless fun.  Good for appointments to pass the time. also good for long car rides
B002JVWRAE|5.0|I love Vampire Diaries very much this show is so intriguing. It's like a darker side of twilight that it's like reading in between the lines.  the price for this blu ray was fantastic thanks love this.
B001AQR3IU|4.0|Ok, it's not serious but it's fun and wacky.  Go with the spirit and enjoy the ride.  Fun seeing name actors in roles that are different than what you might expect.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|This movie I got for my mom, it' is such a good movie my mom, was shocked on the price from other stores and online prices that how great it is for quality for both dvd and blu ray combo pack fantastic. thanks movie is awesome.
B0063IH60K|5.0|the trip home was never so pleasant. l enjoy card games. especially solitary games when i'm traveling great distances. the more challenging games always peaks my interest.
B003L77GH4|5.0|after watching the first season had to get the second season. I know it's on netflix but I rather watch them anywhere in my room or in the living room. so thanks and the price was fantastic thanks. there are some seasons that I would love to collect that are that good.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is really nice. i have it running in the background of my kindle, and check the weather every morning without having to fight my kids for 5min on the Tv for the weather channel. i really like the radar and the personalized weather video clip.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|There are so few movies of significance out there anymore, and this is such a beautiful character driven movie of such a terrible time in our history.  It shows courage in the women of that time--where we have been as women, both white and black, and some of the steps that have brought us to where we are today.  I recommend this movie to everyone, especially the young people out there, to help to understand our history, and to never repeat the things we have done as a society in the past.  Sissy Spacek was a hoot in this movie, and I loved seeing her in this role.  For those of you out there who have seen her in \\"The Long Walk Home\\", you will understand what I mean.
0439023513|1.0|Like many others I started dedicating a good portion of my life to the Hunger Games trilogy after the engrossing first and second editions. The third starts out where the others left off, but about 40 pages before the end it is like a completely different book - full of anti-climating sap and needless prolonging of non-events.   I have seen the word \\"betrayed\\" in other reviews, and I think that is the perfect word for the feeling you will have after reading Mockingjay. I would say if you are looking to purchase the third installment, just dont. Stop at Catching Fire and retain the excitement you felt reading the first two.
B0055SWM08|5.0|nice challenge.  but not impossible calming. and serene. music.  highly recommend. this is fun and makes you think. like the hints too
B005HSG3U6|2.0|First off, this case has done a great job of protecting my Kindle Fire. It gives easy access to the mini-USB port, power switch, etc. I also haven't had any problems with the \\"stand\\" function, although, it could be executed in a better way.   My main issue with this case is the discoloration of the white back. I don't do anything crazy with my Kindle. My house, night stand, desk, backpack, etc. are all clean. Yet somehow, the white back of the case has become discolored to the point where it just looks dirty. I don't know what causes it, and I don't know that this would happen with the other color backs (black, graphite, or pink). What's even more odd is that it won't come clean. I have tried a few different cleaning agents and nothing cleans it.  Other minor issues that I have:  - the front cover feels overly flimsy  - it's hard to hold Kindle with this case on it
B003ZSJ212|1.0|I did not and will not buy this. You shouldn't either. My mom picked it up but, I still have yet to watch it.    I will not own this in my house until a version is put out with the option of watching it with and without added content.  Give Lucas the finger like he has given his fans. Refuse to buy his table scraps.
B002WY65VU|5.0|Shipped and received fast! Great seller! Movie works great! I gave it to my son for Christmas! He loves this movie! I love this movie also! Very funny! It's a fun movie!
B002BWP49M|5.0|Breaking Dawn, Part 1 was an excellent book and turned out to be an excellent movie. I was surprised at how well the movie turned out to be and my sister who is not a big fan of twilight like myself, really enjoyed the movie. These movies are for any age, for it is based on a true love story. They were able to pull off a vampire fiction story very well, and the actors were all great. Do not listen to the critics, anyone can judge, see for yourself.
1451627289|4.0|As are most of his books, the intro is long but bindingly gripping. One is pulled into the fabric of the story. I could see some persons joining in the return to 1963.  It is a bit long so if reading detailed, analyzing stories is not your bent, don't buy/read it.   I am glad I read it.  It is not a difficult read with few multisylable words. It jogs ones imagination.  I suggest it for the historical aspect and the entertaining qualities.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|Worst corporate recruitment video, ever.    I'm going back to Stanford for my Ph.D., this video showed me that a simple Master's degree will not get me into the 5-luxury-house, Maserati car, coke & hooker income bracket I so desperately desire.
B0054R6BFM|3.0|As much as I tried to feel sorry for this girl, I just can't. Hannah decides she has had enough of the world and ends her life, but not before recording her voice on a series of cassettes and sending it to some of the kids who had a part in why she made this decision. She gives 13 reasons why.<br /><br />The story revolves around Clay, the latest recipient of Hannah's tapes. He spends the entire book listening to her story and wondering why he was on her tapes. He wonders how he could have had a hand in her decision, discovering the pain she was in, devastated that he couldn't help save her.<br /><br />Although there was certainly many sad events in Hannah's life, I felt it unfair that she blames almost everyone on her tapes for the reason she ended her life. She gives away too much of her own power to her friends and acquaintances. The worst part is that she sets everyone up to save her and when they fail her, she feels there's nothing left. I would have enjoyed this book more had she taken her power back and saved herself.<br /><br />The biggest contradiction is that when hope presents itself, she refuses to take it yet she makes everyone responsible for her. She comes off more angry and vindictive than lost and vulnerable.<br /><br />Jay Asher's message in writing this book is to remind kids how their actions affect others. That is certainly a purposeful endeavor, but perhaps an even stronger message would have been to show us Hannah moving past her pain and finding the courage to seek help and take it when it is offered.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Calming, clever and all-around awesome!  I love it and am afraid I'll be playing it a whole lot more than I should.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|its a seek and find game, but when you tap on stuff it wont work.  I wont even waste my time on this game anymore, I might break my screen just trying to get it to accept one thing
0887081770|3.0|I wanted to purchase this book for my grandson because one evening he had asked his Daddy to reach for the moon.  I thought this book would be something special for them to share together.  It is a very good book, but I wish the size of the book had been mentioned below the title.  It stated the book was hard covered, so I was expecting a much bigger book.  I was very disappointed when I saw how small it is.  If I had known this when looking for the book, I would have searched until I found one that was larger.
B000VL9XNI|5.0|Great box set. No complaints here.  This is the second time I have bought it as a gift for someone...both parties have been very happy with it.
B00280LYHS|5.0|some people think ancient greek legends is boring stuff. But in this book, Percy Jackson takes your breath away as he spins, cuts, and slashes to defeat kronos and save Olympus! But it wouldn't be the same with out Percy's good friends . . . Annabeth and Grover. It's time to make the fight for Olympus!
0446547654|1.0|I knew how this book was going to end about 20 pages before it actually ended.  For a major novelist, Nicholas Sparks sure likes to draw on cliche plot twists.  I skimmed to the end of the book and finished it feeling angry that I'd wasted so much time reading it.
B000GPIPSS|3.0|The item's disc holder had come off of the case. The discs were still intact which was good. With the problem with the disc holder doesn't seem to be that hard to fix so I decided to do it on my own
B004VMVTNU|5.0|Works great, tons of features.  I use it over the stock alarm/clock because the amount of tweakability this app allows.  I'm very happy with it.
B002QKZLZ6|5.0|Once I figured out how it fit inside, it is a good protection for keeping the bluetooth safe & clean.
B0057A6GA6|5.0|This is definitely one of the top tower defense games available for android. Everyone has their own style and taste but for me this one ranks very very high on the list. If you like tower defense games you won't be disappointed with this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|very addicting to play, hrs of fun. I recommend this app to all kindle owners cause the layout is very fresh and cool to play on
B004HO6I4W|5.0|Rio is a great movie.  Showed up quickly and in great shape.  Very satisfied with the product.  I would purchase the title again.  Great price for the blu-ray, dvd, and digital copy.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|For me, this show is like an American take on that british wonder that is Spaced, except that the characters and the premise are not similar at all. What reminds me of Spaced is the complexity of the humor, and I love that because it allows you to enjoy the same episode on repeated views: every time you find something new to laugh about. Outstanding.
142311339X|5.0|Great Book.  My 11 yr old son really enjoyed. Looking forward for the next one to come out in Oct. 2011.
B0053Q9DQI|5.0|The item was well enjoyed.  As a gift, its use is great to add to a collection, and it was enjoyed by all present.  Definitely a good buy.
B000286RNY|5.0|Kung Fu Hustle was a piece of trash....Shaolin Soccer is a whole different story. If you like just random fun and you want a good laugh then get this
B005FMZVLQ|5.0|Bold statement in the heading? I do not think so because, for my taste, this is one of the better looking casual watches I have picked up. Let's start with what is so appealing about the 1512 at face-value.<br /><br />The size of the head is over-sized to a point, but not obnoxiously so--it is about 1 3/4\\" across, or about 4 1/2cm. Invicta makes a lot of over-sized heads, but a lot of those come with bulky bezels, or cases. This Force feels like it needs to be over-sized. It does not look odd, in fact; it feels perfectly appropriate. Everything flows together so that it should be displayed at a larger-than-normal size, for they need to be seen. The Force does not draw attention based on any contriving attempts at being ostentatious, but merely because everything as packaged makes for a very fine, and eloquent, looking time piece resting on your wrist.<br /><br />From the band to the crown, everything about this watch is smooth and effortless. The band is one part genuine leather--bottom--and another part cloth--the top--. Though you do not have the flash that a metal band will you give you, the cloth/leather band will give you light weight and freedom of motion that a oyster or jubilee would not. There are always sacrifices. However, the sacrifice here is not as great as going from this band to a common metal, for, even though the band is part cloth, you could wear this with a suit and still be in your rights, and wits, to do so. Seamlessly go from beach/boat watch to the evening's time-teller.<br /><br />I will say, though, that the cloth band is prone to eventually discolor--in this case it would become less black--and become more stiff when exposed to water, or staining. Because this is cloth, though, maybe it could be hand-washed back to good shape.<br /><br />The lugs are interesting. Where most lugs are flush with the case, this one protrudes down and curves. When free-handling the watch you can tell a big difference , as if you have never noticed them before on other watches. It is interesting in a good sense, and seems to curve, and *hold*, onto your wrist more. It does not bring any discomfort, but is unique to this model as comparing to many other common watches. To give you an idea of what it looks like, picture viewing the watch face down dial-side up on a table looking at it from the side. The lugs curve down so that they actually hold up the watch and do no allow it to be flat, or flush on the table. On your wrist, however, they curve around your wrist and the backplate is flush as it should be.<br /><br />There are many details of this watch that are really surprising that I like, and the backplate, of all things, is not an exception. The back is embossed, so that you can really feel the lettering. Also it has a matte, brushed metal, appearance and feel. Because I like things that are great with potential wear, I think the addition of the matte backing is exceptional.<br /><br />As you can see from the look of the dial, you either like it or you do not. Personally, I prefer everything that was chosen about this watch from the color of the second hand to the lettering around the bezel. It all fits together and feels like a light, airy, boating watch. It has a subtly classic look. Though this does have the usual very high Invicta 'MSRP', the current pricing on this equates to a very good return on your money. It is certainly worth it.<br /><br />You know what the face of the watch looks like. You can see the pictures posted covering many of the angles. If you like the look, I absolutely recommend buying it because; it only gets better.<br /><br />Another watch in this line that is also a stunner, and has a white dial, is the 1514.

B000PMG16U|5.0|I bought these DVD's for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and they arrive very quickly. I had plenty of time to wrap them and put them and put them under the tree.
B005FVA3LK|4.0|I've been a somewhat U2 fan since the mid-to-late 80's and found that \\"Achtung Baby\\" was a worthy and edgy album of the 90's. After reading that this is becoming rare and hard to find, I ran down to Best-Buy and found thier last copy. First off, this is heavy, both in content and weight (no dolly required), but still a substantial box-set none the less. The music is impressive and the extra's are excellent, as are the DVD's. I only wish Pink Floyd would've gone this route instead of the \\"Immersion\\" fiasco. It is worth the $ and you will not be disappointed.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|I ordered this set of DVD's along with the prequel from amazon and was able to save about 50% by buying them separately. Great deal and fast service.
B001NLKT60|4.0|Like the first installment of this trilogy, Stieg likes to lengthily develop the story line throughout the beginning of the book. My opinion of this may come about because I am somewhat use to being thrown into action from the very beginning of a book to grab my attention, but that is besides the point. This was not so much a problem because I was use to it from The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo though, and should not be seen as a criticism but more as a forewarning for anyone who did not read the first book and get an idea of the author's writing style.<br /><br />My only criticism of this book is the way the police investigation throughout the middle of the book really does not advance the story much for what seemed like 150 pages (kindle version) and this got extremely frustrating considering the way I felt constantly enthralled to the story in the first book. That is just about the only reason I give the book 4 stars instead of 5. The ending to this book was worth my boredom throughout the initial phase of the police investigation and anyone who has not read any of the books in this trilogy should certainly start with the first.
B005XZHQKY|4.0|Worth purchasing, beautiful colors and very interesting; Need more similar footage in 3d.  Saw sea creatures that defy the immagination and a call to environmental concerns.
B005HSL626|5.0|great game!  works fluidly on the kindle fire.  the visuals are smooth and colorful! I have played it on ipad, ipod, android phone and now the fire.  Highly recommend.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|Long time fan of the show, I know that I will get countless hours of laughs and will enjoy every episode. I watch the reruns all the time, now I can have a Friends marathon whenever I want.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great for anyone who loves the classic solitaire. Wonderful to play anytime. Very easy to play from ages six to whenever.
0307269752|5.0|With Criminal Minds, Dexter, and Hawaii 5-0 the pickings for those of us addicted to crime, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a much better way to spend a quiet evening at home.  Mikhail is as sexy a character as Shemar Moore and there are no commercial interruptions. If a passage in the novel becomes to graphic, much like your DVR, you can skim through it.  Buy the trilogy all at once and you can save on your electric bills for at least one week.
B004U52VPS|4.0|This is a fun game for any age.  Even though the directions do not suggested individual play, it is possible.
B000KIRT6A|4.0|Bought this to use it as a band filter effect for my guitar (no bass, pure mids, no highs) and it does it just right, I´ve also have use this in my effects loop and does make a difference, its made of plastic so just dont dance on it. overall a nice pedal for the price I paid, its a bargain.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|This Paris Hilton Gift set was very cheap and it was shipped right away even during Christmas time. I will buy from here again.
B0063IH60K|4.0|good app. like the fact you can play a winning hand game. not much more to say about the app
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app it has the best videos in the world. when ever I need a map its there for me. I never have to ask twice to get something that I need from ever.this is the best app. it does what ever I need it to do if I need the weather its there if I need a mmap its there and if I need a vidoe to get the weather it is tooooooooooooootaly there. I have no problam with it what so ever its my favorite app and I'm going to keep it for as long as I live.
B002RI9HUM|5.0|This is my second Marian Keyes book and it is excellent. Rachel is a member of the Walsh family and she is an alcoholic. It is a funny, sad, brave and reflective story. Marian deals with the subject sensitively. This is definitely not a girlie book about shopping and fancy cocktails. It is a book to make you think, but there are also some serious laugh out loud moments too.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Movies are in perfect shape. I have no complaints at all. Got them at a great price too! All movies were included. Very good purchase.
6304457391|5.0|Most excellent.  Loved the movie.  High intrigue.  Well written and acted.  Arrived most expediciously and in great shape.  Nice film (VHS) quality.  No defects.  Thanks again.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I found Quell a to be a relaxing way to stimulate my mind while listening to relaxing music. This combination puts me into a zen-like state.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|if you're the creative type. You've been dreaming of this app. I use it to organize my stand up and music and even important serial numbers.
B005ZUR724|2.0|Great game with amazing gameplay but the update bug needs to be fixed really bad, also needs to be cross platform to iOS. 5 stars if fixed!
B005I5UFG6|5.0|Great as always, good melodies and dance songs. A little sad but that was to be expected. Good progression from the last album.....
B003EYVXUU|5.0|Let Me In executes a story in the vampire genre within a limited scope of action which strengthens the audience involvement with the characters.  Every scene serves a purpose and every shot is lit/designed well.  The shot structure lends itself well to the story as some limited space shots are intercut with the moving shots that are very impactful.  I highly recommend giving Let Me In a proper viewing.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works well.  Just as you expect Solitaire to behave. Plenty of options and features. Landscape mode takes a bit getting used to.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|love the cover, easy to put on and it protects the screen.only thing is it doesn't stand or i haven't figured that out yet.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I installed this app with no problems on my Fire.  I find that I check it nearly everyday.  It gives a nice, quick check of current weather.  And you have ready access to forecasts (hourly and daily) as well as radar maps and more.  I did find the setup to be confusing.  When installing, you're given a screen to enter your location, but no instructions to guide you.  You can enter location and move forward, but you may find yourself waiting for something to happen on that screen.  It won't.
B001EAWMFQ|5.0|My husband loved it.  We first say this show on TV many years ago in black and white.  For me it was quite bloody, but my husband enjoyed it.
1419702238|5.0|This book was in perfect condition when I received it in the mail. My little brother loved it when he opened it for Christmas.
0393338398|5.0|Moneyball provides a great inside look at how the game of evaluating baseball talent has been evolving. The background info about Bill James is outstanding, as are the 'fly on the wall' vignettes of Billy Beane's wheeling and dealing. Couldn't put it down.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|It's amazing how fast I got this DVD. It was in great condition, and most of all, it was a great movie!
0446582778|5.0|What can I say after the previous 193 reviews of this marvelous work?  Connelly brings Harry Bosch to life as his heart slowly breaks while he tries to maintain a not-so-delicate balance between departmental politics and hunt for the killer of Howard Elias. The victim is a black attorney revered by the black populace of Los Angeles and hated by the LAPD. Bosch's boss is terrified of inciting another race riot that might rival the Rodney King debacle and, despite his direction to Bosch to find and nail a white killer, Bosch minds his own direction to get the right one regardless of race. His wife is pulling away from him and life is looking bleak but he does his job in the only way he can. Bosch is always the respected maverick in the department and Connelly holds to his own read of his man in a riveting story.
0810989956|5.0|This book was in really good condition. They little boy I got this for loved it when he opened it up on Christmas morning.
1609410416|5.0|Well the audio book I purchased was a gift for my daughter. I have not listened to the book, but she has started the book. She has raved on and on about how good the book is, and insist that I read it (listen to it) when she is done. I've never listened to a book, so this will be a first if I do.  She thinks the book is great and would suggest to all to get a copy and read it or listen to it!!!
B0063GORYU|5.0|great game for any one that enjoys solitary games it is a challenge That regular solitary card games does not give the player
B0063GORYU|5.0|fun all day long. easy to get lost in and very well made Ai. I give my full support.
B00632HWOG|5.0|hola. a todos mis. amigos y conosidos espero que se esten. portando bien y si se portan. mal nomas. avisenme.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Season 2 brings the space journey and interaction between the characters to a new level. A well written series, well acted and directed, and I have no complaints besides the fact that somebody at MGM made a stupid decision to discontinue the series. Yes, it ends sort of nicely, but it's still a cliffhanger and we remain with the big question of what happens next. I have to say that Universe truly had it's own style, more realistic and human than SG-1 and far better than Atlantis. Robert Carlyle gives an excellent performance along with all the other actors.
B006C1DH92|5.0|if u have fruit ninjas u will absoulutely love this the gauntlet is awesome and the classic mode is the same great app download this app
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Though perhaps not a classic on the scale of reknown that A Christmas Story, It's a Wonderful Life, etc enjoy, Christmas Vacation is undoubtedly the funniest of the season.  With required viewing of at least 10 times between Thanksgiving and Christmas Day, this showcasing of Chevy Chase, Randy Quaid, and the rest of the cast will live on as a paramount kickoff to the Christmas spirit and holiday family cheer.  Long Live the Griswolds!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|great free app! don't read the stupid reviews about unlocking the levels its fun to unlock the levels get it! get it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|I love this app!  I've come to depend on it for weather reports for work and home.  No need to to catch the weather report on TV.
B004RJMUJO|1.0|it wont even download to my device this app sucks this app is stupid you should not download this app
B0054JZC6E|4.0|awesome just wish it wasn't so expensive to unlock games. but most games are fun but some are hard. but I love it
0743297334|4.0|Two recently read books prompted me to reread this book, The Paris Wife by Paula Mclain and Pat Conroy's My Reading Life. The former is the story of Hemingway's marriage to his first wife, Hadley, and their life together in Paris. The latter is an enjoyable and informative book about the people, authors, and experiences that influenced Conroy. Hemingway is one.<br /><br />The moment I began reading The Sun Also Rises, I remembered reading it in college. I didn't \\"get it\\" then, and although I now understand Hemingway's situation and the climate of the times a little better, I can't say that I LOVED the book. It could be because I kept wondering about Hadley, his faithful wife, and wondered what he was doing/thinking while she was in the shadows being supportive and encouraging. From The Paris Wife, I learned that she was hurt not to have been mentioned in even a slight way in this book.<br /><br />While I admire Hemingway's terse style and his extraordinary use of symbolism, I feel that this is more of a man's book. Jake, the main character, and his chums, including Lady Ashley, pal around together and do a lot of drinking, carousing, fishing, and watching bullfights. Everyone is in love with Lady Ashley, Brett, and also she's engaged to one of the men, she falls in lust with a young bullfighter, Romero, with whom she runs away. Jake ultimately rescues her, but before this time, there has been a lot of fighting and heartache related to this gal. All the men seem to be in love with Brett, and she seems to be in love with being happy.<br /><br />While the post war crowd appears to be intent on a hedonistic lifestyle, there is much more to The Sun than that. It has several universal themes woven throughout its pages including love, hurt, betrayal, the quest for meaning, loneliness, unrequited love, and the endurance of the human spirit despite all of the tragedies of war...and life itself.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|great app...have access to many versions ...can stay connected with lots of reading plans. what a great way to keep God's word close.
1451627289|5.0|Stephen King helped me suspend reality. Although I recall quite vividly where I was when I heard JFK was killed, i was, while reading this book, hoping the protagonist would succeed in stopping the assassination. This is a must-read, book!
1583334386|5.0|Kelly's writing style is fluid and easy to understand even when she's dealing with complex topics.  Her claims and conclusions are backed up by real research which makes them much more powerful and believable.  Her step by step approach allowed me to apply the concepts to my own life, particularly during this time of the year (holidays) when willpower can be especially hard to find.  There area many laughs in this surprisingly humorous take on such a serious topic.  Would make a great gift for anyone struggling to resist that second (or third) helping!
B005TQAI6G|3.0|She looks great!  However, I was disappointed.  Would have rather previewed this by renting it before I bought it.  Love the bonus videos on the menu but it is the LEAST Britney and her producers could do for her fans who bought this Bluray.  It didn't bother me that the concert chosen for the Bluray was low live vocals over recorded tracks.  She does that because she has to dance through all of her songs and no artist could sing live and dance like she does without lip syncing.  Not without being deprived of oxygen anyway.  What bothered me is the fact that there was NO spontaneity, or like one reviewer said, no connection with her audience (at least not for this particular live performance).  The scene in which she does bring an \\"audience member\\" on stage seems totally preconceived.  I wonder if the guy was really picked at random or whether he was an actor who was hired.  The performance of \\"If U Seek Amy\\" was unintentionally laughable because she couldn't keep up with her choreographed moves.  It was rushed and irritating.  The whole show was like watching an elaborate and lengthy video.  It was too dry, rehearsed, and over-choreographed.  She was too standoffish with her audience and if I were a fan who paid for this particular concert, I would have been a little PO'd. Lastly, the concert was way too short to have been totally worth it.  Sorry Britney, either you could have done a better show, or at least chosen one from another city for release.  Still a fan, but the entertaining music videos hardly make this Bluray worth purchasing.
B002XTBEDI|5.0|I have Cranford and now watching the return to Crandord was fun.  If you like period pieces as I do you will enjoy having both movies.
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I bought this for my mom and she absolutely loved it. Her schedule has been so busy she missed Season 3-4 altogether so she wanted a refresher of what it was all about so she could watch Season 3 and know what they are talking about. I would recommend this for any SOA fan especially since I got it during Cyber Monday for only $10!
B004P1JEXE|2.0|The first 2 books were good, the third started to feel like a long road to nowhere. The 4th book feels like the author is stretching a good concept out way too long,no real plot and it all feels like its been done in previous books. Won't be bothering with book 5.
B004G600A4|5.0|Even though my daughter is 19 years old, she asked for this movie for Christmas this year. She couldn't wait to watch it, even though she's seen it on tv many times.
B0055SWM08|5.0|though I was going to sleep, turns out I was mistaken. beautiful music and very addictive gameplay make this a must play
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is great and very addicting! The ads can get irritating sometimes, but the fact that it's free makes it worth it :D
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Fits perfectly. Having a hard time getting it to stand up my kindle fire though. five more words are needed.
1250006341|5.0|BEAUTIFUL BEAUTIFUL BOOK EVER!  First of all, it came so fast (2 days before the deadline). The book itself, OH WOW its a jewel! Glossy cover with the family crest in gold in the hardcover. The binding is amazingly sewed and the amount of pages is 303. It's a very thick book with matte pages and overwhelming pictures and photographs. The text is elegantly presented with a lot of historical facts and information about real Dukes and their families. I don't want to spoiler anything but the book is worth gold! I won't change it for anything!
B000RH0C8G|3.0|Thought this was going to be something different then what I purchased. It is a book of strategy, numbers and theories. I thought it would have more of story to it. My fault not the authors' fault. Didn't finish not my cup of tea.
B004UID2LC|1.0|This app worked great before the update on the Galaxy Nexus. After the update it will not even run. Fix for a better review.
B0063IH60K|4.0|i love playing solitaire and the way that this game is set up it makes it fun to play
B005HSG3VK|4.0|Product is just as advertised. The only thing I would have any complaint about would be how it stands up. The little crevice that allows it to stand could be a little better, sometimes it takes a couple times to stand correctly. Good product though, I have three Kindle Fires and they all have these types of covers.
B003L77GGK|5.0|My order shipped very quickly.  Amazon had the best price which I find with all the items I order from here.
B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|We all bring a unique perspective to the critical table, that is what I admire most about people is that I think about all those emotions, reactions, thoughts, feelings that I have every second and realize that EVERYONE is doing this.  Amazing beings these humans.  There's plenty out there that I don't like and don't understand why others do but there is also plenty out there that I may not like but I understand why others do.  I've read some reviews of this and it seems that many of the negatives are telling us that we can't like this.  I think Keane is a supreme talent.  I think the younger crowd of this point in time has musical saviors in Keane, Coldplay, Gorillaz, Snow Patrol, Arcade Fire and a few others because I personally think most music created now has no soul whatsoever and is made for iTunes.  The art of the record is all but gone.  I was so happy that Arcade Fire's The Suburbs shocked the iTunes crowd and took home the grammy because they are practically single handedly keeping the art of the record alive.  Now comes  Night Train.  I can play this from beginning to end without any urge to skip at all.  Great pop music.  Yes, it's different with some of the rapping and it doesn't have those soaring choruses that made \\"Your Eyes Open\\", \\"Crystal Ball\\" and \\"Nothing in my Way\\" such memorable songs but there is still great music on this disc and fans of pop music could do much worse.
B006RED4GA|5.0|I loved House of The Devil and waited anxiously to see The Innkeepers. I was not disappointed. The acting is very good, atmosphere is wonderful and it is full of suspense. It's not gory and doesn't explain every little detail (which is bothering some people, I had no problem with it.) I would say it's definitely in my Top 5 horror films of 2011.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|simple good mic, offers plenty of cord and solid on off switch. I put a small black zip tie around the wind shield foam to keep it in place. other than that very good.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I love this app! It was one of the first apps that I got for my KindleFire. It is fun and adicting and has many levels to play. I hardly ever notice the ads, I'm paying attention to the game mostly. I highly recomend this game.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Keep up the great work Kelly!!! True American Patriot!!! You deserve everything you work so hard for!!! I hope you have a long career in the music industry
B005HSL626|5.0|Most fun I ever had! The graphics are awesome, the sound effects are great, the blades with graphics are the best!!!! I love choosing blades and backgrounds because they're awesome. I play this game a lot and I usually play when I'm really bored! I love it! :)
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I really enjoy this app. It was the first I installed. I was always hearing people talk about it and I wanted to try it out. It proved to be an enjoyable game. Though it does get rather hard.
B002AT4KA0|5.0|It's a great video bringing back the main cast and loaded with action.  One of the best in the series of movies.
B004XIZN5M|5.0|By far one of the best conditioning books I have ever read.  After being a serious weight lifter for many years and suffering from many aching muscles and joints, I know that this book is the real deal.  I can even do the most demanding exercises while putting no stress on my recovering shoulder injury that I obtained while lifting free weights.  Their is just no pain anymore.  When I lifted with free weights their was pain, but now their is not.  It is amazing how the body naturally alines itself while using your own body for resistance.  I cant wait to show off my one handed pull up, push up, handstand, and one legged squats. All of the exercises in this book are multi joint.  Meaning that they are the best exercises for gaining muscle size and strength.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|My daugter was absolutely thrilled to receive this item for Christmas.  After the gifts were opened, we all sat down and thoroughly enjoyed the DVD of Adele's performance at the Royal Albert Hall. She said that on her way home, she popped the CD into her player and sang along with Adele the 200 miles to her residence. The idea of getting both the DVD and CD is great.  It'll be a gift she can enjoy over and over again.
B005DOL0R0|3.0|I don't like it becacuse it's very tight for kindle fire If you put cover your kindle fire.If you want to buy sleeve so you should go to anyshop(Best Buy or Office Mac etc.) then try it on and compare price and then it's time to shopping.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it's very basic, no split screens or anything, but its a great way for me to read God's word and keep track of my notes. I love the reading plans too, they're super useful.
0893815233|5.0|Excelente livro com fotos maravilhosas. Particularmente, aprecio cópias desde negativos grande formato. No caso, o trabalho feito em 8x10\\" é precioso. Não posso deixar de mencionar uma crítica feita ao trabalho que aponta para crianças nuas... Resumo minha opinião sobre este tipo de ressalva na frase de um fotógrafo russo que toma imagens de adolescentes nus e que foi questionado sobre uma possível desaprovação do seu trabalho em países como França ou Inglaterra. Ele disse: \\"quando está doença chegar até a Rússia trataremos do tema...\\"
B004LWZW4W|4.0|Hand up who thing Tim Roth looks like a monkey? Me!!!  Anyway, this excellent precursor does a nice job, although one must remember that it steps away from the original premise of the series in that I definately remember an explanation that a plague affecting cats and dogs lead to simians becoming household pets and developing intelligence in some other random way, possibly by watching endless repeats of The Love Boat on daytime tv.   Anyhoo, here, the funky monkeys some to life in a much more believable way, although they have a long long way to go before becoming the dominant species on the planet, presumably a sequel must then thin out the humans a bit and allow the apes an ecological niche to exploit.. hark at me, the scientist, ho hum, this will be one I will be investing in for the dvd collection.
B000FGGE68|5.0|For a fan of Milla Jovovich in the Resident Evil series, Ultraviolet is a must purchased movie.  It is even more exciting than Resident Evil.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|I like Daniel Craig, here, he is James Bond on a horse taking on aliens in a rather imaginative romp. the aliens, wot are a bit like the underground monster thingies in the remake of The Time machine, the one with \\"Mike\\" from Neighbours in it, have rather unimaginatively decided to steal all our gold through some sort of complex mining operation instead of finding an asteroid made of gold or something, or robbing Fort Knox or something like that, and they lassoo the townsfolk for some reason that I have forgotten and ..anyways, it all great fun, and I rather liked it.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Just bought this album, as my wife is a fan of Kelly Clarkson and we both support Ron Paul!  Thanks for showing your support!

B0054PSY2W|5.0|Glad to see this on Blu Ray.  It's hard to pick which Coen Brothers movie is the best but this is certainly one of the most enjoyable with a typical imaginative, skillful Coen screenplay and great music.  I can't count how many times I've watched this movie and now it's hear in a well-mastered HD scan.
B002VHI8J0|5.0|Whether David Mitchell's \\"Cloud Atlas\\" is six tales in one, or one tale in six parts, or a bit of both is hard to tell. What is not in doubt is this author's masterful ability to spin a confusing yarn with one hand and then magically unravel the confusion with a well-placed, carefully honed sentence or two at the crucial moment. While each of the individual tales from which this delicious fabric is woven are neither particularly original nor, in some cases, pleasant, there is a richness in their diversity and a splendour in their range which, in combination, is breathtaking. There is a brilliance too to the book's structure, with its climax coming in its centre, so that it becomes a journey of two halves -- inwards and outwards -- rather than following the traditional story arc form with which western readers are more familiar.  There is a beauty too in the interconnectedness and yet separateness of the component tales; meanings and connotations positively coruscate across the mind as the pages turn.<br /><br />All in all, I found this a wonderful read and one from which I simply could not turn away until it was done. Superb!
B0052UZIFA|2.0|I played this on my Motorola Droid RAZR...loved the game itself, but after spending a couple hours working through the levels all of my game progress would be lost.  This happened twice and serves as an excellent deterrent against playing it any more.  Decided to try it again on my Samsung Galaxy Nexus and I can't get it to work at all.  Unfortunately have to give it a low rating.  Again the game is great, but what fun is it if you lose all your info.....and then can't play it at all?
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am very sad to find this amazin series 10 years after it was cancelled. And now, reading around the web it seems that Firefly didn't even have chance at the first place. If You haven't seen it, You definitely should. It is only 14 episodes long and I promise You that they are all worth it, every single one of them is superb.
B0057R5G6E|5.0|I recently purchased the Jurassic Park Ultimate Trilogy Gift Set (Blu-ray + Digital copy) for my son for Christmas.  He was very, very excited and happy to receive it.  He had been wanting it for a long time, but when I checked it out at other places, I just could not afford to pay the amount they wanted in the electronic stores.  I was able to purchase it at a lower cost through Amazon.com and received it in perfect condition in time for Christmas.  My son and I are both very pleased and I will be sure to check with Amazon.com the next time I am looking for a sweet deal.  Thank you Amazon.com.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|The game is extremely entertaining but if you are younger and trying to play it could be extremly difficult even me being 14 some of the games were not to easy while others are easy. But I love the game and the different strugles some of the games give you.
B005I6EU48|5.0|After a mishap with my initial kindle, (re: fell asleep reading it, it got tangled in blankets, and when i awoke, i stumbled off the couch and stepped on it. sad face) and ordering another, it eventually occurred to me i should likely invest in some sort of protective cover. since i have a minor fetish for old looking books, i was looking for something faux leather bound and \\"antiquey\\" but the only one i could find that looked as such was one which was being marketed for the Kindle Fire.  However, after comparing the sizes of each, Kindle Fire: 7.5\\" x 4.7\\" x 0.45\\" and mine, the Kindle 3 with keyboard: 7.5\\" x 4.8\\" x 0.34\\" i thought i'd roll the dice.  I am pleased i did.  My kindle fits snuggly, and after a day or so of it fitted inside, the Verso Prologue Cover adjusted to it being inside and lays completely flat when closed.  It protects the screen when in my bag, all the buttons are accessible when reading, and looks, in my opinion, fantastic. I am quite happy with this purchase.
B0066W1AZK|1.0|There is something wrong with this game.  I.was playing and the opponent got another QUEEN for NO reason!!!!! then during the opponents turn my OWN piece took one of MY PIECES!!!!!!!!!!  This app is ANOYING AND BUGGY!!!!!!!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I love this app. I love the reading plans and love having bible with me everywhere.  Good interface and graphics.  Gave only 4 stars though because of frequent force closes.
B000I2MRHE|4.0|We purchased this when our son was 3 months old for Christmas.  He used it some when he was little, and our older son (3 years) enjoyed pushing him in circles.  They are now 2 and 4 and my 4 year old will spin our 2 year old around on it and it hasn't broke - and is still in \\"brand new\\" shape.  The only complaint is that it sits ontp of the bottom piece so it isn't really secure when they are younger and te pieces usually ended up in our sons mouth when he was young.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enyoy ease of use as a pass time while learning how to navigate my new Kindle Fire. I highly recommend this app to be used much like it is intended to be used on our computers, as a learning tool and a brain rest. The ads don't seem to be much more than a momentary blip.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|the best game of the word because it have differents places,sounds,Colorful and it is fun I say that the kids have to play this
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really felt compelled to write this review as soon as I got my cover because there were so many negative reviews, particularly back in November.  I understand some of the ones in November, because this case started out at $39.99 and many people thought it was too expensive.  Well, obviously, Amazon listened and dropped the price to $29.99, making this a perfect case for your Kindle Fire!  I did a lot of research regarding what kind of cover I wanted, and looked at all of them.  I knew right away that most of the leather covers/cases would be out of the question, since I did not want any bulk or weight added to my Fire.  So, lightweight, and good protection were my top priority.  However, I also wanted the flexibility of taking the top cover of the case and folding it behind the Fire while I'm using it, since I use my Fire a lot while I'm in bed.  This cover does that perfectly!  In fact, you fold the cover back, slip the elastic band over it so it stays put, and then you can slip your hand under the elastic band, which gives you even more stability while holding it.  Like a previous reviewer said, this case does not cover the screen at all, which I noticed happens a lot with some of the leather cases. Someone else made a comment about the speakers being covered.....huh?  Have no idea what they're talking about, unless it's the fact that when the case is closed and you slip the elastic band over the front, one of the speakers gets covered then, but the only time you use the band is when you're transporting your Fire somewhere, and you want it to be protected.  If you want to listen to it, don't use the elastic band.  Seems pretty simple to me.  Another person said that they couldn't get it to stand correctly, kept falling over.  There again, they must have been trying to do this incorrectly or on some very unstable surface.  I've used the stand and it's perfect for watching a video.    I read Amazon reviews all the time, and I've come to the conclusion that some people are complainers no matter what, or just plain clueless! That's why you need to sift through the reviews and use some common sense over all.  Bottom line, if you want lightweight, no bulk, good protection, fold back cover, good stand, and IMHO a good price, this is the case for you!
1596432594|5.0|Someone drew so many pictures for this book, and then Hilary Sycamore gets credit for the coloring. Just having a theory for everything that photons and electrons can bring about by interacting won Feynman and two other scientists the Nobel Prize for physics, but this book has to keep repeating that calculating probabilities is the basic procedure for determining what happens, and any reasons why aren't good enough to overcome the basic \\"I don't understand it.\\" This is a sentimental book about many people who had an important part in the lives of many readers. J. Schwinger is another character in the book I had almost totally forgotten, but the book says, \\"Schwinger spoke before me. He already had a great reputation.\\" And then, \\"look, Schwinger started to lose people when he tried to talk about the meaning of his equations.\\" Path integrals stumped that audience. \\"What is this notation you are using? I've never . . .\\"
B0054JZC6E|4.0|very nice app. some games are very easy but some are very hard. play lots to unlock more games. points are pretty easy to get
B005VMVUAQ|4.0|I didn't think this was a bad movie at all. True, the plot has been done many times, but in this picture, I enjoyed the way one lie kept giving away to another one until the truth was finally revealed; that isn't to say that I didn't sometimes see some of what was coming. It was downright ridiculous at one point, but that ridiculousness was played right into the story line.  The fact is it reminded me in some ways of \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" and not just because Kidman starred in that movie also, but because like that picture, a jaded marriage with the addition of a typical rebellious teen is thrown into a life-and-death situation that forces the family members to appreciate each other. In truth, it's really a \\"what if\\" movie. What if instead of suspected infidelity, adolescence revolt, and an inattentive spouse, life is suddenly threatened by gun-carrying, desperate, dangerous, psychotic trespassers? And considering the script they had to work with, all the key characters (both good and bad) did a decent job.
B003NFM3JK|1.0|This caricature of Charles Dickens' wonderful Christmas story was not only a complete disappointment, it was a pointless attempt at humor.  Beginning with completely skipping over Ebenezer Scrooge's walk home from his office on Christmas Eve when the first hint of something unusual happening (the ghost horses and hearse)became evident, to the Ghost of Christmas Past portrayed as a disembodied head with its skull on fire, hovering over the ghostly shoulders of a weird little body, and on to an almost total bastardization of a Christmas classic, the kindest thing I can think of to say about this film is, \\"Shame on Disney.\\"    I was aware before I bought this DVD, of course, that the characters were not real people, but rather computer graphics, but that seemed like it might be kind of a fun film.  I have the movie \\"The Polar Express,\\" and there are no \\"real people\\" in that either, and most of the Polar Express voices belong to Tom Hanks, and that's a most enjoyable film.  But as it turns out here, Jim Carrey as the voice of Scrooge, minus that fantastic talent for visual comedy, was a real loss of what I thought was good potential for an enjoyable version of A Christmas Carol.    I agree with the statement of a couple other reviewers that there are a few questionable scenes in what would most likely be considered a children's movie since it was made by Disney, scenes that might be frightening to young children.  Having viewed this movie, if I had young children, I'd be very reluctant to allow them to watch this one.  For a delightful presentation of a different spin on the Christmas Carol movie, the musical version \\"Scrooge\\" is the best so far.
B002SQFZ68|2.0|Truly crappy audio; this is noise, not music. Compared to the Adele blu-ray which was a 5/5, the sound is a 2/5. I don't care that it is in DTS-MA, if it is nothing more than a big cacophony. The sound engineering is bad; Jon's voice is covered by the band. Save your money, buy a studio CD.
0393072231|5.0|The book came in a very timely fashion and I received it exactly as described. Used (formerly from a library) but in perfect condition with zero marks on the pages.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Any fan of the series, will love this edition.  It leaves you hanging and you'll want to review the prior movie to refresh your mind.  As always, another wonderful movie.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I've always been a fan of Kelly Clarkson. I LOVE her songs and her talent.  I normally buy her songs via iTunes but today I AM buying her CD to HONOR her as she courageously endorses RON PAUL. You're now an AMERICAN HERO in my book, Kelly!!  Keep up the GREAT work, too!!  RON PAUL 2012!!!!  Your courageousness and honesty will NOT go unnoticed!   A Fan Forever!
1559408855|5.0|This movie was unfortunately something I will never watch again, it's too strong for me, thought it would be a walk in the park considering iv'e seen plenty of scary movies. But this one will be in my collection, will never let friends, or family watch, borrow, nor will i have a discussion about this film ever, i gave it 5 stars just because of the fact that no other film compares to it, it's in its own class of Disturbing, it really plays with your mind, emotions, and you can't bare to have a feeling of disgust. If you watch it, do not eat directly before or after this film, just trust me.
B0007TKNII|5.0|I'm a huge Phantom of the Opera fan and have viewed multiple times on Broadway although to my regret, I never saw Brightman and Crawford in title roles. Schumacher's crew and cast did an outstanding job bringing this Gothic masterpiece to film. Gerard Butler is a great Phantom - sexy, menacing, and he can sing. Yes, he sings in a deeper baritone and is no Michael Crawford. But Gerard wasn't trying to be as he's not a professional singer. I love Michael Crawford, but prefer Gerard's deeper rougher vocals especially on \\"Music of the Night.\\"  Obviously, we all would have loved to see Brightman and Crawford reunited on film.  That would have been sheer perfection.  However, it wasn't meant to be. Now Emmy Rossum is delightful. Her singing is exquisite and that voice is simply lovely to hear. There is definite chemistry between Rossum and Butler. I like Patrick Wilson whom sings beautifully, but his acting is rather stilted. I wonder if Schumacher could have coaxed more from him. Minnie Driver is hilarious and over the top as the opera diva. I loved her. Miranda Richardson is a fantastic bonus to any film. The production and costumes are lavish, and the musical score is fabulous. Highly recommend!

B002ZG980U|4.0|Intriguing, action pack, mysterious, entertaining, sensitive, guessing what's next, protecting those in danger.  Never a dull moment.  I recommend this movie.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|I like the game. You have to tap an item quite a few times for it to get recognized but other than that, the game is fine.

B004SIP86Q|5.0|good movie for the time, the story was a litle bit shocking and the best of all, Kate Winslet was extremely good in this one.
1442344288|5.0|I was unable to stop listening. I love the way the story evolves. I find the reader Craig Wasson is just superb. He makes the story come alive. So, I cannot understand that people find this boring. Take the time to let the story evolve. Patience. Like a good whisky. Let it come to you.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|- great sync ability  - easy to take notes - easy to go back and forth between using other apps/web browser and writing on evernote
0061365343|5.0|I read this book series - wasn't it obligatory? - as a child in the 70s.<br /><br />Reread these now, all you adults out there.  What seemed daring and adventurous to you as a child will be revealed as terrifying and horrific, when you read the books as an adult.  The wolves?  The bear Ma thought was a cow?  The malaria?  The long winter? The freaking GRASSHOPPERS 6 INCHES DEEP ON THE PRAIRIE FOR TWO YEARS!?  It's like a Stephen King novel... only real.<br /><br />Not to mention the history I'm picking up.<br /><br />Perhaps the best thing about these audio books is the narrator.  Broadway actress Cherry Jones has the ideal voice for this project: homey, comforting, and vibrant enough to make children feel good while capturing the attention of adults, as well.  I'm just finishing up \\"The Long Winter,\\" and actually got tears in my eyes when Cherry Jones read Laura calling, \\"Pa!  The Chinook is blowing!\\"<br /><br />I can't recommend highly enough the thrill of listening to these as a grown woman.  I can't imagine the utter joy a mother would get from listening to these with her child between 8 and 11.  ::Sigh::
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|My wife and I got a Kindle Fire for Christmas and needed to get a case/cover for it.  After looking online at Amazon and reading reviews we decided to go with this case by Marware.  I especially like the Marware videos that provide the product description.  The Kindle fits perfectly and actually clicks into place.  The cover itself is very sleek and durable and has the tri-pod feature which allows your kindle to stand on the back of the case to watch movies, etc.  Overall, I think it is a great product.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Love this game. A classic. You should try it out. Love it on the Kindle Fire too! win win ein
0195073401|5.0|Book was sold as \\"new\\" but was actually in \\"Like New\\" condition.  Has previous owners name written on inside cover and binding felt like it had been thoroughly read. No marks on pages so the read will not be effected.  I'm OK satisfied because I bought it for a desk copy for years to come and it already has wear.
B005K17RU0|4.0|have it on my kindle fire for a few weeks now and am very pleased. no trouble with it at all. gives me my home town weather with a tap and can be expanded to show more details easily. navigation is also simple and straight forward.

B0025UHKNS|5.0|I have nothing else to compare this to, and haven't really figured out all it can do, but what I have figured out I love.  I am not a very tech savy person so I always am frustrated trying to figure out how things work.  I'm training for my 1st 1/2 marathon and have no grasp of pace and really needed something that would help me pace myself and I love it for that and knowing the exact distances that I've run.  There is a bit of a lapse for the pace on the watch to catch up when I change my pace, but it hasn't been an issue. When I have more time to figure it all out, I imagine it will be an even better training tool than it is now.
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to use and makes you feel like you really know what you're doing even though  sometimes you dont plus its free
0439023521|5.0|I bought two copies of The Hunger Games so me and a friend could read it together. They came quicker than I thought they would, which was nice. The packaging was lacking as far as water protection went - so if it were dropped in a puddle the books might have gotten wet - but luckily there was no need for such precaution. Both books look pristine and I can't wait to crack them open with my friend and give them a read! :)

1932100660|5.0|I thought I knew a lot about healthy eating, such as eat more colorful vegetables, and cut out fatty meats, but this book is full of all kinds of proofs that the main cause of the health crisis in America is animal proteins, and especially those from milk and dairy.  I love cheese. In the weeks since I've taken this to heart and cut out most animal proteins and all milk and cheese, my major health problem, sinus trouble, has all but disappeared.  Since I always said that the doctor who found a cure for sinus problems would be rich, I hope doctors who prescribe this diet get rich.
B005O30Y5Y|4.0|Everyone by now knows the plot, the characters and I am not going to even entertain the idea of providing another dull nothing saying naration of the movie. I liked the movie, the theme is known.. have fun watching it at home in Blue Ray, it is defintely better then the DVD version.
B0018CMJSU|5.0|So far have only watched The Godfather, haven't gotten around to parts II and III. I really enjoyed it. I had no interest in this type of movie until after I got hooked on The Sopranos. If you loved the Sopranos I would expect that you would love this as well. It is a fairly long movie however you will not be bored for a minute of it. The set was also a great value.

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I'll get this out of the way up front: I'm not a Steven King fan, not even a horror fan. What's great about 11/23/63 is that it's not horror, it's as far away from typical King as anything I can think of. It's really an  intricate and detailed combination of a love story with great historical and future fiction. King blends the genres seamlessly.  Jake, who is recently divorced and broken in many ways, is a small town teacher who through a friend, discovers a time portal to the past. The uniqueness of this portal is that the traveler is taken to a specific place and a specific day - always the same place and day. The time traveler can stay in the past as long as desired and when the traveler returns to the present, only 2 minutes have passed. But, if the traveler stays in the past a year, or 10 years, he will age all that time and be that much older in those \\"2 minutes\\" when he returns.  With the JFK assassination as a backdrop, and the time portal that drops the traveler in the US of the past a few years before the Kennedy assassination, Jake travels back to make the future better and avoid the evils he sees that would have been prevented if Lee Harvey Oswald can be stopped. Along the way we get a good background (with some fiction and speculation thrown in) on Oswald's life and the single gunman theory versus various conspiracy theories.  While embedded in the past, we find that Jake falls in love, makes new friends, and becomes part of this new past, while trying to keep 1 step ahead of his new friends who gradually discover he isn't who he says.  In this version of time travel, we find that the past can indeed be changed. And we also learn that at least in King's view, world politics and cause/effect are much more complicated than a simple \\"Save Kennedy Save the World\\" motto would lead you to believe.  So let me come back to say, I'm not a King fan. I bought the Kindle edition of 11/23/63. I like it enough that I'll probably buy the hardcover to keep as well. That's rare for me but this book is worthy of being on a real shelf.

1583334386|5.0|In the introduction, the author asks us to take the approach similar to that of a scientist, a nonjudgmental and curious observer. She does this because she wants to guide us through our real world/real life willpower experiments where some strategies work and others fall flat(and as she notes, failures in lab study are rarely discussed).   The book is organized to follow the author's 10 week Stanford course and provides us with an opportunity to take class each week from the comfort of our home. Every chapter contains opportunities to 1) REFLECT on what we already know and understand about our willpower and 2) PRACTICE an \\"experiment\\" and how it applies in our own lives.   The book is well-researched and the writing is clear and funny. The scientific explanations are accessible and they help me maintain a nonjudgmental position even as I contemplate my own moments of weakness and reflect on my past experiences with temptation and failure. While I haven't had the book very long, I feel as though I have a funny and knowledgeable friend by my side who is gently and humorously awakening me to several \\"aha\\" moments. More importantly I am learning how to find and use motivation to develop my willpower.  This book is for people who want to understand human behavior (including your own) and ways to practice changing this behavior. It is also for people who want to learn basic information or catch up on the most recent brain science as it relates to the psychology of behavior.    I've been anticipating the book's release and I look forward to putting its lessons into practice! I've recommended it to others, including friends and researchers, and I'm happy to recommend it here too.

B0065CCT6U|5.0|I can listen to them over and over.  Chris' sound is very unique and very enjoyable.  I've purchased all of his music CDs over the years.
B005FITIGO|4.0|Enjoyed the movie overall.  My only issue is those who were hurt, were not personalized, they are basically invisible.  We know that it is a 'dog eat dog world', but really, everyone at the firm got paid one way or another.  Show the impact of someone losing their business and the impact it has on their family because they trusted one of those treacherous, absolutely immoral bastards.  That makes the movie.  Also, if you are not in the business, I doubt that you would get the overall drift of the movie, a lot of jargon and MBS, really?!? I think a little more bridging information may have helped lay people understand better what was happening.  Even movies like 'Boiler Room' and 'Trading Places' gave you enough information to understand what was happening without an MBA from Wharton.    All in all, a rather accurate portrayal of the types of personalities that are manipulating the market.  Let the buyer beware!
B005RAO0GS|5.0|I can listen to them over and over.  Their sound and singer is very unique and very enjoyable.  I've purchased all of their CDs.
B005ZUR724|1.0|sigh.....well Ive had the same problem as everyone else, my version of the game wont update. it looked really good ans i was looking forward to playing it but i cant. thank god i only spent a roller on it

B005FVFWOI|5.0|Steven Wilson succeeds in creating a LOUDER version of Aqualung without demoralizing himself competing in the \\"loudness wars\\" that have ruined so many classics.  The stunning clarity and dynamics of the Wilson's mastering job is a GOD SEND!! His remixing of this masterwork is remarkable in its seperation, dynamics and FEEL.  Plus, Wilson must've discovered a mother lode of tiny details in the original tracks and decided to exploit them.  For instance, there's an extra note on a guitar lick Martin Barre plays on the intro to \\"Locomotive Breath\\" that must've been mixed or edited out on the original release.  Other very subtle vocal inflections or 'mutterings' can be heard throughout the album that wasn't audible on the original release.  There's something special going on during the flute/choir section of \\"My God\\" that I've never heard as well.  The beauty of it is, Wilson's work is an actual IMPROVEMENT over the version I've been listening to for over 30 years.    This version is an ABSOLUTE MUST HAVE thanks to Mr. Wilson, who also kicked ASS on King Crimson's 40th Anniversary albums.  I hope he continues to win this battle against loudness and over-compression, because true artistry will always win in the end.  Just listen to those stunning Beatles remasters.  Revolver never sounded better and neither has Aqualung.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|Awesome.... if you don't mind adds that come up when you have wireless Internet. great for traveling, or when you just want to play angry birds.
B005V2EVBQ|2.0|I believe this product is overpriced. It does not appear to be much protection and the stand up flap keeps coming loose from the slot in the back and it falls over. Would not recommend for protecting your Kindle.
1451627289|4.0|I'm not a fan of Stephen King, but I do like a good time travel story. This novel held my interest despite the length, but it was more of a love story than anything else. I thought it got bogged down in the middle and could have been tightened without losing the sense of the characters or story line. I liked the way he showed what life would've been like if November 22, 1963 had turned out differently.  Since I lived through this time period the first time around, I found the plot quite fascinating.  All in all, it was great fun.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is awesome!  I have played many different versions of Solitaire but this is by far the best one yet!!!!
B005L38QK2|4.0|The mouse is great, like some other people were saying I do have a problem of accidentally clicking the right \\"Number 4\\" button at times. The mouse, however, looks awesome, feels good, and has great control... just takes some getting used to. Have only had it for a day but it is a keeper!
1401323820|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  Lots of action and emotion with a several twists.  I recommend that you read all three books ---- makes a good set and great for evening reading.
B0063IH60K|5.0|wonderful game and very absorbing to play. it is a great game that forces your mind to work double time.
1455510319|5.0|Reviewer Michael D. (\\"cc coach\\") hit the nail on the head: the trial and associated investigation and prep. work are the story, and the story is riveting.  I am a trial lawyer, I've read all but two of Connelly's books, and, as with the others, I couldn't put this one down.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Bought this for my daughter for christmas with the kindle fire she loves it.with 2 yrs warrenty, also bought a second kindle fire with a black over..:)
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Well after an hour and a half of unwrapping and 120 hours of review the votes are in and Perplexus Epic is the clear winner of this Christmas haul for my son. Edging out Star Wars Force Trainer (still in its box), Bop It XT (this was a close rival but he mastered 100 by mid Boxing Day) and wait for it... a PS3 with 8 games!  The addictive quality of this toy is it's main trap but the fact that it is 100% kid-powered keeps them hooked as we know their resources of energy is unlimited (except for the magical energy-sucking properties of homework)    I agree with the other reviews about the numbers.  My son has an astigmatism an was complaining about the obscurity of the numbers.  It doesn't add or take away from the challenge to have the numbers in say a dark gray or something but the way it is with the ghostly raised numbers is mainly the reason it gets put down after you try 5 times to see a number and lose the ball off the track trying to read the number or see the arrow.  I gave it a 3 for durability because I'm not sure how it would hold up over time with kid drops.  I'm imagining two grabby 8 (or 13 or 25 or 40) year olds seemingly \\"taking turns\\" but one impatient grab at say the airport, mall, playground and a fall to the concrete and it's game over.  Literally.  But that's really my concern for gifting as I have an only child who's pretty good with sharing... whoa wait a second, he grabbed if from me just yesterday... oh oh it's personality altering...  Hey speaking of my angel, he just walked in, reached over and grabbed from under the tree... his epic!  I just came online to order him the other versions with Christmas card money.  I'm going to pick up an extra or two to have on hand for gifts as they are suitable for any age and just about any occasion.  This is one of my best Amazon free shipping finds ever!  Good job Perplexus!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Its classic solitaire. The only annoying thing is when ads pop up before you start playing a new deal. otherwise it works great.
B005M2A4D4|4.0|A gift for my family that all are able to watch and enjoy.  We have all enjoyed the resurgance of the Doctor Who series, and are looking forward to seeing these episodes
B005IZLPMY|5.0|this is worth wating a few days and saving money, bought it here and saved a few dollars then going to bestbuy and over paying and this blu ray is extactly the same as bestbuy and it shipped fist class mail it came a day sooner then what was said plus it came before new years
B0044AS6BC|5.0|This is a great book esp if you like Stephen King. It's a must read! You will be on the edge of your seat once you get into the story which I must say is thrilling from the start.
B001FQDLV8|5.0|Buying something like a collection of \\"slightly used books\\" is a leap of faith. This leap was worth it. Not only did I get what I wanted but also a bonus of two more books. Always nice to find that there are people that are honest in their business practices.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|The DVD arrived the very next day in great shape. It was just as I remembered it. Excellent price, excellent buy!
B005W3G2D4|5.0|Masterfully recorded, inspired and deeply emotional is how I would decribe Kelly Clarkson's new Album \\"Stronger.\\" Kelly's vocals throughout this album are par excellence, not only technically, but also in terms of emotional depth which resonates with the soul.  [[ASIN:0446537527 The Revolution: A Manifesto]]  [[ASIN:1595553509 It Is Dangerous to Be Right When the Government Is Wrong: The Case for Personal Freedom]]
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great app. Pretty smooth play with background. and deck options. As close to a computer version as you can get.
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|This book took over my life for about 3 1/2 days. I love the protgonist's development and couldn't have a clearer image of his love interest, Sadie. Amazing read.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app. I love how its costomizable and its cheap! and first I was doubtful about this app and now I know I was wrong about my opinion. this app really is 'Xtreme'
B0063IH60K|4.0|game is great.  playing on my new kindle fire.  works well with the fire.  random deal seems harder then Pc solitaire game.  don't win very often.
B003L77GH4|5.0|The second season of this series is amazing!! Love it, and can't wait for the third season to come out so I can have that one too! Definitely shows that Vampire Diaries will be around for years to come.
B002KSPKRS|1.0|I am sure that these headphones are good quality, but the pair was defective, so I returned them.  The real tragedy was it was an xmas day gift.
B004XNGKBS|5.0|Come in extremely handy on the kindle fire. Don't know y the bad review, but maybe if some folks would go through the tutorial they may get better use of the app. A download must, download this app.
067960085X|5.0|My book, a new-looking, small volume of only the three holiday stories, and published by Modern Library, was just the ticket for after-Christmas, quiet-time reading. Where and how I came by this book is unknown. Though the stories, \\"A Christmas Memory,\\" \\"One Christmas,\\" and \\"The Thanksgiving Visitor\\" all use the same characters and the same setting--a small boy and his \\"66-year-old friend\\" in Alabama, the events described by Capote were different. He is a master of words and descriptions, especially applied to nature. Nowhere in the listing of Capote's books is this collection of three stories; perhaps under Modern Library it can be found. This tiny book is a peek into Capote's writing that is delightful. Recommended.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Great three novels - never thought I'd be unable to put my Kindle down! Can't wait to get to the conclusion, but know that I'll be disappoonted that there's no more to read.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|Both games are amazing games that have been around for awhile so I'm not gonna focus on them, but on what this collection adds to them.  1) remastered in HD(of course) both games converted great and both games are beautiful to play and watch  2) both games are remasters of the PAL version, so those of you that played the American versions years ago you will notice some small changes. Nothing that will change the game tho.  3) trophies have been added for each game. To get them all Ico will take about 12 hours and SoTC will about 50-70 hours ( that's a lot of game play for cost of these games)  4) I didn't notice this when I bought it but it has a bonus section that has some behind the scene footage and two dynamic themes (one for each game)
0375842209|3.0|I read this for a book club and the only reason I finished it was because of the pending meeting.  This is one of those books that if I was reading for fun would have been abandoned withing the first 20 pages.  I did not like death as the narrator, I didn't like the way the book flowed in the beginning.  Once you got into the story more, it was much more interesting.  But again, the end dissapointed me like the beginning.  I don't want to ruin it for everyone, but it is a depressing book and I need something else to keep me going.  I wouldn't recommend this book.
B004SBBDB2|5.0|I bought this cable so that I could watch iTunes TV shows and videos/movies I've saved to my iPad, iPhone, and iPods. I've not tried to stream, as I use the Roku for that. It took me 30 seconds to set up and works beautifully!
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I don't buy a lot of movies but after renting this I knew it was one I would want to watch more than once.  It's a little like mean girls, except Emma Stone is a much smarter, funnier, cuter, and more likeable version of Lindsey Lohan.  And all the supporting actors add so much to the film, it's a must see!
B000A2UBN4|5.0|\\"Cape Fear\\" is a thriller genre film and is a remake of the 1962 original. Robert De Niro is terrific as cold and rancorous Max Cady, who is seeking retribution from perceived poor representation that he received from public defender Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte). Whilst in prison Cady has not only fine tuned his body with strength, but he enriches his mind with deep study of the law. He stalks out Bowden and penetrates his life at first slyly and then with vicious intent. This movie often leaves the viewer on the edge of their seat, and the ending is truly gripping.

B005OP71GC|5.0|Revenge has an overall rating of 3 because it's weighted by someone who gave it a 1 due to the fact it's not available on DVD for purchase!  Really?  Come on.......that rating of 1 has nothing to do with the brilliant content of this episodic nail biter.  As \\"Hamlet\\" described in his/her review, it \\" is loosely based on one of the greatest novels of all time, Le Comte De Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas, and given a contemporary spin\\".  For every woman who was raised to oppress her shadow side, this drama gives liberty to embody the potential, and hauntingly graceful, mad avenger in each of us.  The only disappointment is that the producers hesitate to produce more and faster.  It's a travesty to pause in the first season of a new venture that is on the cutting edge........10 episodes do not equal a season.  Now out of spite this makes me want to take revenge and give the show a 1 rating, but I know better.....the content is worth the 5.
B0043X1FL8|5.0|\\"Awakenings\\" is a drama film that focuses on catatonic patients with a history of encephalitis lethargica. Dr. Malcolm Sayer (Robin Williams) is frustrated by the lack of effort going towards treating the patients, and he explores medicating them with a new drug L-Dopa. The patients make notable improvement and Leonard Lowe (Robert De Niro) provides wonderful insight into his life with the disease. The movie is inspiring as it confirms that a fresh approach, and an enthusiastic attitude towards treating a disease, can result in breakthroughs, and even if the symptoms only improve temporally, it is a pleasing story that gives hope.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B004PAHZMC|5.0|Our youngest kid received this as a gift from Santa.  It might be a little more complicated than the large zip-bin boxes for a younger child.  However, it works great for us.  The velcro shelf inside gives an added dimension to the pretty graphics on the inside.  He has connected it with his older brother's tie fighter zip-bin for great lego adventuring!!!  Great fun.....and quick pick up and go!!!

B00008PX8P|1.0|I am very disappointed to fine out that I could not watch the vidieo in the united states. It said that it could not be played in this region. I would like to send back. But I am not sure how to do this. Please advise. Janice Larson indianfox19@yahoo.co
B003B5M0PO|4.0|This book isn't a simple, cute story with talking horses and sweet masters. There are many war stories; but none like this. Joey is a pretty young horse who gets through life with a kind manner and isn't changed by the war around him. His obediance and loyalty are apparent in all his adventures. The author's other books are AWFUL but this one was brilliant. It is packed with clichÃ©s but it is quite good.
B0063GORYU|5.0|gamergirl  Great game - always liked to play on the computer - glad it is on the Kindle Fire.  This is one of the first free games that I downloaded and did not know how the ads would pop up. Thought ads would bother me - but the are not the distraction I thought they would be. Spider Solitaire is just a fun game to play.
B004I2K4DY|5.0|I loved this musical in the theatre. I have seen it twice. The concert is just as good. Wish I could have been in the audience for this performance! The story is told wonderfully even in the concert format. BUY IT!!
B005ZTFPFQ|1.0|All you people who call the people who give this app a low rating 'idiots', LISTEN UP! This app does exactly what is says it will, and I have no problem with that, but it is the morals on why the want you to pay for the other games. In my opinion, Atari is just plain greedy. The idea of a 'free app' to get you to buy more apps is ridiculous!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this game is even better than the first.  new challenges and just as much fun as the first one! A+++
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is fun. I enjoy the slicing fruit. It is a very fun arcade game. There are just a few problems with the ads. It works great on my Kindle Fire.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Adele engages with her audience in a magical way that makes watching this dvd a truly emotional event. Great vocals with outstanding instrumental accompaniment.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app. Very pleased with this considering it's free. I would prefer to have move options when it comes to satellite views.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I've never reviewed so here it goes. This app is so fun!  It has a variety of different games which is great! Some of the games are hard which is frustrating, but it's a wonderful app!
B0000007BI|5.0|\\"And I hereby declare this amphitheatre open!\\" Ernst Hogwood-Blofeld, the head of SPECTRE (Sinister Period-Practice Enacted to Counter Traditional Readings Everlastingly) trumpeted to the array of period practice musicians who had packed into the arena. He was enthroned in the imperial box surrounded by his equerries, castrati of easy virtue and his cronies. Mister Bigglesworth was sitting on a purple cushion.<br /><br />\\"When's the hot-dog boy?\\"  Rene Jacobs - Number 5 in the evil organisation - squeaked. \\"I'm so hungry!\\"<br /><br />\\"Whatever,\\" Hogwood-Blofeld growled. \\"Now, who's up first? Is it a Murmillo up against a Thracian or a Retiarius? When will the Venators make an appearance? I paid damned good money to build this Colosseum into the side of the hollowed-out volcano - even Brunel would be impressed; I wanna see some bloodletting!\\"<br /><br />Number Five squinted at the program.<br /><br />\\"Why, it's John Eliot Gardiner up against Phillipe Herreweghe in the Mozart Requiem. They're also going to slug it out in the K 341 - the great Kyrie in D Minor. Their discs are identical so it's apt to pit them against one another in a battle to the death.\\"<br /><br />Herreweghe emerged soon afterwards from one of the tunnels. He was armed with a fearsome-looking club.<br /><br />\\"Number One, we who are about to die salute you!\\"<br /><br />But plural remained singular. There was no sign of his opponent. The crowd jeered.<br /><br />\\"Where is Jeggy!\\" Hogwood-Blofeld bellowed. \\"Get that useless bugger on the phone - now!\\"<br /><br />Jacobs handed the mouthpiece to his boss.<br /><br />\\"Jeggy, get your bony backside out into the arena now or else I'll stop bankrolling those bloodless, unlistenable Bach cantatas on that precious little label of yours!\\"<br /><br />\\"But Number One, England needs me! Besides, it's rather unfair to make me fight this brute! It's almost evil!\\"<br /><br />More virulent threats were uttered.<br /><br />\\"Very well.  I shall do this under sufferance. Let me be known as Sir Galahad of the Thin Stumpy Blade!\\"<br /><br />With reluctance, Jeggy donned his `Britannia' armour and trudged out into the arena. His shield was emblazoned with the Union Jack<br /><br />The combat that followed was one-sided indeed. Herreweghe soon had Jeggy on his belly and whimpering for mercy. The crowd, displeased by the brevity of the fight, was voraciously demanding his head. All eyes turned to the imperial box.<br /><br />Hogwood-Blofeld cleared his throat.<br /><br />\\"Jeggy delenda est - Jeggy must be destroyed!\\"<br /><br />He raised his right arm to shoulder height and clenched his fist. A thumbs-down was about to be bestowed upon the crowd when Number Five darted over to whisper in Caesar's ear.<br /><br />\\"Number One, think twice! Pitch is the only thing that Herreweghe has in common with SPECTRE. He gives full vent to the grandeur of the Mozart Requiem - there's no clipped phrasing or miniaturisation whatsoever. His tempos are astute throughout. His singers are superb - even the young Bostridge controls his whooping. Anyone who can appreciate a so-called traditional reading of K 626 will latch onto this performance - its has charisma; it has depth and it is fully expressive. The opening of the Confutatis is cyclonic in its fury. No-one knows when the Kyrie in D Minor was composed - the manuscript is missing - but Herrewege makes the strongest possible case for a kinship with the Requiem itself. The recording is exemplary. From a HIP perspective, the trombone in the Tuba Mirum is somewhat understated - this is good - and the Hostias is on the quick side. Even so, many people proclaim the Herreweghe K 626 to be the front-runner in the market and one can see why - from their misguided perspective I mean! Jeggy, on the other hand, is a bona fide member of SPECTRE. His Mozart Requiem is anaemic and snappily so. At any juncture, it sounds like it is going to break out into evensong - that's another way of saying he bowdlerises the work. Clipped phrasing is legion. The Kyrie in D Minor is equally tweedy. Even so: Jeggy might be a duffer but he's a friend of SPECTRE whereas Herrewege is probably an agent provocateur.\\"<br /><br />After a moment's thought, Hogwood-Blofeld gave a thumbs up.

0439023513|5.0|After reading all of the negative reviews for this book, I was afraid because the first two books were so incredible and I did not want this one to disappoint. This book, although sad and depressing in many parts, was amazing! Maybe not quite as good as the first two, but this book was definitely a page turner. Some parts were a bit confusing, but I thought it was well-written. I was never a huge fan of Katniss, she was annoying in this one especially. And of course Peeta's character was not too likeable in the first 3/4 of the book after what the Capitol did to him. It would have been much better if there was not so much deaths, but it was still an excellent conclusion to my favorite book series!
B005LFQRTC|5.0|How cool to watch this show again.  Love being able to see it from beginning to end.  Yeah, the clothes are cheesy and tight, but good family tv.  What a concept - a super hero, without the tacky outfit!  I only bought the 1st season - I guess my only complaint it is a little pricey.  Haven't paid $30 for a DVD in a long time.
0525423281|5.0|I thought that this book was a very good compliment to Anna and the French Kiss. Where Anna was thrust into a whole new country, with strangeness and culture shock, Lola has been living in the same place, and is so comfortable there that I think it was once said that \\"she was the neighborhood.\\" Anna was somewhat quieter and withdrawn, and Lola was confident and out-there. Anna was far less experienced that St. Clair, where Lola was far more experienced than Cricket; and Lola was the one who had to decide between the boy she was in a relationship with and the actual nicer one that she had more of an emotional connection with. St. Clair was the somewhat unattainable, chariasmatic, and popular love interest, where Cricket was awkward, devoted, and adorably geeky. However, both Lola and Anna are easy to connect with, and are both very vulnerable. Both books are realistic and incredibly satisfying.
B004EPYZT4|5.0|This was a great movie.  Very true to comic, and Jason Momoa was terrific.<br /><br />I have little kids, and didn't get to see this in theater in the summer. Bummer.  I wish I did.  Just got this for Christmas, and it was excellent.<br /><br />I'm honestly not sure what people were expecting, this is Conan, and it was true to form.  Visuals were amazing, fight scenes were well choreographed and flowed nicely.<br /><br />I easily give this a 5, it's absolutely perfect for the genre and true to the source material.
0811870413|5.0|I can honestly say that I no longer make any other kind of bread.  The recipes in this book take time (although not necessarily all that much more effort) but it is all worth it in the end.  You can read the other reviews and get an idea of the flaws in this book.  The baker's math is not accurate.  The photos lack captions.  The whole thing is pretty chatty and a little pretentious.    So why am I giving it 5 stars?  Because using the method described I have made the best bread I've ever made and some of the best I've ever tasted (and I've eaten a lot of European bread).  Yes, you must carefully read each recipe and some of the instructions are less than clear.  However, if you are careful and are willing to make a few mistakes, you will learn how to make bread that is truly world class.  I've made all the bread recipes in this book (except for the brioche) and all of them are simply amazing.  Curse you Tartine for ruining my ability to enjoy any other bread!
B003UESJH4|5.0|This movie is such an amazing story.  I really enjoyed the acting.  I will watch this movie many times over for years to come.
B0063IH60K|4.0|this is great to have when their is nothing to do. program consistently works well. the one flaw I have found is that it does not tell you when their are no more viable moves and that the game is over.  still very happy with it,would recommend to others.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this app. its great.  easy to use. never crashes. no annoying ads all over the place. a must have.
B005UKJX4E|1.0|Boring, trite, cliché, drivel, tedious, mind-numbing, infuriating.  Early in the film there was an excessively long mosaic sequence depicting the big bang to earth's formation.  It drifted into a scene of computer generated dinosaurs in a primeval forest.  I wasn't sure if I was suddenly watching Jurassic Park or if this was simply a bad joke on the audience.  We seriously talked of leaving then, and should have, but thought surely, there must be some point to this thing since there was a big cast and a 4-star rating.  By then, other people in the theater had enough already and were starting to filter out.  So, we stayed and it just got more tedious and ridiculous.  The final scene was absolutely moronic.  We suffered through this horrible film and, in the end, I was angry at how it never went anywhere.  I wasn't alone.  Other people in the theater were saying they wanted their money back or this was the worst piece of ****.  I can't remember ever feeling so ripped off by a movie.  In fact, its two months later as I write this and it still makes me angry! Dreadful, horrible, if not the worst movie ever, it's in the bottom 2 or 3.

1554512115|5.0|I love this story.  I think it's great that there's a children's book that shows a girl solving a problem using her brains, not her brawn and reversing the gender roles.  Our daughter sees the reversed gender roles everyday when mommy goes to work and daddy stays home.  :)
B002KSPKRS|4.0|I bought these for my girlfriend for Christmas. She's a CoD nut. This headset is great. Awesome, deep, rich sound. The only problem which I've noticed is that if you have any devices running on 2.4Ghz, there's a likely chance that you'll hear a click every now and again. Usually about once or twice every minute.  All in all, Great product, would purchase again.

1400049628|5.0|Some people have said that I have an unhealthy obsession with zombies.<br /><br />I must beg to differ.<br /><br />I do enjoy reading about zombies, watching movies about zombies, etc. And when I finally got my hands on The Zombie Survival Guide (Thanks, Zack, for letting me borrow it) I have to say, I was nothing short of thrilled.<br /><br />To explain it pretty much perfectly, The Zombie Survival Guide is pretty much like any text book. Instructional, professional, believable. While reading it, I had to keep reminding myself that zombies aren't real and that this book was written as a joke. But, like I said, it's just written so believably. It is very well-written, and always is entertaining. It walks you through pretty much any situation you could ever be in during a zombie attack and, lets just say that if ever zombies were to actually attack, this guy right here would be prepared. *sharpens machete*<br /><br />If you enjoy the myth of the living dead and such, you will most definitely enjoy The Zombie Survival Guide. I honestly think that this is a must-read for any fans of horror, thriller, or similar genres. You will certainly not be disappointed.<br /><br />Readingteen.net

0545259088|5.0|This is the third book in a YA paranormal series.  Sam and Grace are werewolves.  Sam has finally stopped shifting into a wolf but Grace has not had the experimental cure yet.  In this book, the final in the series, Isabel's father is planning an aeriel wolf hunt to kill off the pack.  Cole is trying to discover a cure and a way to force a wolf back into its human form.  Sam knows that he must lead the pack to a safe place.  But will it happen before it is too late?<br /><br />With some unlikely allies in a police officer and Grace's friend Rachel, the trio of Cole, Sam and Grace try to save the pack.  Throughout this, Sam and Grace's love story continues and deepens.  Grace reveals to her parents that she is still alive.  Olivia, Grace's friend who was turned into a wolf, is not so lucky.  As a secondary love to hate love story, Isabel and Cole's relationship deepens as well.<br /><br />Also, Sam gets a chance for a sort of closure with his adoptive father Beck.  Sam has matured and has become a strong person, sure in his own skin.  This strength helps him help Grace and in turn, the pack.<br /><br />This was a good finale to a great series.  I had hoped for a little epilogue detailing what happens 20 years later, but that did not happen.  All in all, I have enjoyed this series a lot and liked the characters.  I recommend it.<br /><br />[...]
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I started off this book completely in awe of the author's writing style. His descriptive prose are elegant and original, his characters endearingly quirky. The premise of these pictures (all original vintage photographs) to embellish an original story I thought truly wonderful, but the six stars (yes I know there are only five) I wished to give it through the first half of the book dwindled to a mere three by the end. The pictures, in time, seemed not so much to enhance the story, but to keep it going, as if the story had to struggle around them. I truly loved all the passages regarding the hero and the quirky Emma, and anything at all to do with the old house (I'm an old house enthusiast, after all) and Miss Peregrine's children, but this romp in the land of Odd too soon turned into just an ordinary monster chase. There was no end, except to set us up for the next book, and I felt, when I closed the cover, that I'd been cheated. The premise is superb, the images are a definite hook, the writing is up to the challenge, Riggs is certainly an imaginative author...so what happened to the story? It just...trailed off like a balloon out of air. As a reader who loves a good, long book, and one who is yet not opposed to a good series, I think I would much have preferred the former; more pictures, more plot, less chase, and a neat, (almost) tidy ending. And then I'd be more than eager to read the books that follow. As it is...I'm not so sure. I'll pick one up to look at the pictures, but whether I'll read it or not, I simply don't know.
0307595579|5.0|After seeing, the girl with the dragon tattoo, book over a thousand times in peoples hands on my commute to work I had to get a copy for myself. I opened it up for Christmas and I will probably finish all three books before new year's eve. People with addictive personalities you have been warned.
1451627289|5.0|Exceptionally good book with more than a little nostalgia in it for me.   I cared about the characters (Most of them. LOL!) The ending made me cry like I was 2 years old and someone took away my candy; I haven't done THAT while reading an SK novel since Jack Torrance said goodbye to Danny in \\"The Shining\\".  This is NOT \\"horror\\" as defined in his past novels. But no worries! You'll be nervous and jumpy, all right ... by the ghosts of the past and a nerve-racking climax. I say go for it and spend some happy (?) hours in 50s and 60s.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Would be a 5 star review if it had came with enough nuts to mount, the multi-socket clamp can be confusing at first and instructions hardly explain correct positioning. I had to stop mid installation to get hardware to finish mounting, was very frustrating. Hope Cooler Master gets back to me before I move system from test bench to case as I would like the correct pieces to decrease chance of issues. Aside from my issues with the cooler it keeps my overclocked i5-2500k @ 4.5Ghz 24/7 nice and cool at 37C idle and never higher than 65C under full load prime 95 torture tests 12+hrs. These tests were performed on a test bench at room temp, on a push/pull system on cooler.<br /><br />EDIT: Cooler Master sent me a full hardware packet RMA on it was quick and painless. I explained issue and they sent out hardware within a week.

B006QF7664|2.0|Interesting plot line, but the emphasis on realism resulted in an annoyingly chopping viewing experience.  Since this was an attempt at actual taped footage, I suggest that viewers forgo the extra buck to order in HD.  The clarity added isn't worth it.
B0063ESZ9K|4.0|This case is very well made and provides good protection for the excellent Fujifilm X10. It's all leather (including most of the strap) and lined with a soft suede that both protects and pampers your expensive camera.   Two small complaints though. First, the X10 is a fairly substantial compact camera and this case makes it larger still. I use my X10 as a replacement for my DSLRs when I don't want to carry all the bulk, and the X10 in the case is nearly as big as (say) a Leica M9. You can leave the top cover off and just use the body part of the camera, but that leaves your expensive X10 halfway exposed.   Other small complaint is that I'd like to have a small wrist strap with the case in addition to the longer neck strap. Including a small wrist strap would make the bulky case that much better, since the strap is quite a handful on its own.   Otherwise, it's a great case and worthy accessory for the wonderful X10.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I'm not sure what everyones problem is but this case is exactly what I was looking for! I was a little worried about the purchase I made when I read some of the more negative reviews. However after using the case every point they were trying to make against this product couldn't be further from the truth! They must be working for a competitor or something... haha

1428166556|4.0|Book: The book was interesting discussion of non-routine events, \\"Black Swans\\".  His thesis is that non-rountine events are routine and occur in more areas than others. He attests forecastos are very unrelible for Black Swans and for many events beyond one year and very questioonable beyond five years; laughable beyond ten years. The science of forecasting is too immature for detail prediction. it best to think in general terms and prepare for the certainity and opportunity of Black Swan.  Apparently, the author took this tactic as a trader in 19.80's and became comfortably wealthy though he never explain how he exploited a Black Swan.<br /><br />The authored showed considerable depth in his study of finance, mathematics, and philosophy most of which are well out of my areas of study. He has strong criticism of classic philosophy and the overuse of models as well as the misuse of models for non-routine events. I have to wait to see if the author cited sources or provided footnotes.<br /><br />Audiobook: The reading was animated despite being a non-drama and had very correct pronunciation of the many foreign words / terms.<br /><br />Overall, the book is a must buy for students of critical thinking and decision especially those we are in fields where non-routine events can provide great rewards or costs.
B005V20JKI|5.0|this is the beet game I have ever played but Its really additive and hard to stop playing plus best graphics ever!!!
030796695X|4.0|Book: This book was on our reading list because it was an example of critical thinking.  It is true that some professions, maybe all, there are unchallenged assumptions. These assumptions may be applicable to only some cases or many cases, but not all. It was revealing that many assumed that money the overwhelming factor for team success since it was the only sure way to get the best talent.  It was forgotten that teams win not a collection of high priced players.  CD: The audio production was good and to standard.  P.s. The movie follows the book well but the details of the baseball finance and Billy Bean's life are only hinted at in the movie due to film time limitations.
B00004R99F|5.0|I enjoyed watching this as much as I did when I was a child.  My husband and I recently went on a trip down memory lane while singing to the CD in the car this past month and have not been able to stop thinking about it since.  We got a great deal just to relive the memories on DVD together and are pleased to own it! I can't wait to one day share it with my own kids! The songs are great, it's heart-warming and classic just the way a great Disney movie should be, despite its lack of recognition back in the day!

B004TTMYQG|5.0|This is by far the best calendar app I've found so far. I have a Samsung Transform and it has next to no power for apps, but this is one app that I couldn't live without. I've tried all the free ones and a few paid ones, but this one has all the features I really need.  For me having a widget on my main screen was important, and with this app I am able to make it as big as I want, hide the tool bar and customize how the information is shown. It seems like these are fairly basic requests and I should be able to find 100 apps that do the same, but I have yet to find one I like better. It syncs perfectly with Google calendar, and color codes the different calendars even on the widget. Data entry is very simple and easy to use.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I very much enjoyed the first two books in this series, despite any technical critiques I may have had. The stories were real and the characters oozed humanity, which is why I think it became so difficult to create the conclusion to the story.  Early on, Collins let us know that Katniss's life was never going to be a happy one, and this book continues that trend. We follow the main character on a journey following her experiences in the Hunger Games and we watch as things continuously spiral out of control, yet everything still remains linked to that eternal notion that human beings can be very, very bad and very, very evil.  While that central theme remains a troubling one as you continue to turn the pages, I found that any message I could take away from this book was buried too far under a plot that got a bit out of control and descriptions that were handed to us on a silver platter. Collins, unlike in her other two books in this series, began to hand-feed us explanations and metaphors that really didn't require a guided tour. For instance, a particularly important revelation is made about halfway into the book about the family cat, and his inability to catch the bright spot generated by a flashlight and how this mirrors Katniss's own struggles. Rather than allow the reader to interpret this message, Collins spends several paragraphs using forced, unpolished self-narrative from Katniss to tell us how this cat's struggle is also her struggle. It reads in a manner like she had no faith in us to get this message ourselves. Perhaps we wouldn't have, but it wasn't necessary because Collins never fails to let us know how conflicted Katniss is as a character. We didn't need the cat story to provide that level of detail; it was already quite well established.  In addition, the difficulty of telling the story of a revolution becomes very prominent in this book. Though it was often a bit simplified through teenage emotions and an all-too-present love triangle theme, the book progresses to an extremely riveting final act, in which Katniss is FINALLY forced to truly confront the evil of humanity she has been discovering for 2 and 2/3 books. She has certainly experienced that evil and suffered consequences from it, but never before has she truly had to sit down and make a decision about it. Every action she has taken to this point was a decision generated by very jarring circumstances that would likely make anyone act the way she did. The conclusion of the book offers us a chance to see Katniss taking her destiny into her own hands, finally, and making a true decision in which she has to weigh the costs of taking a human life versus her own need for survival. Perhaps that is the ultimate moment these books have been pushing us to, but it was a bit of struggle to get there through this third novel.  Overall, as I said, I very much enjoyed the first two books, and I think my negative comments are really more based on the idea that the first two novels are considerably better than this one. I recognize the difficulty Collins faced with this novel, in that she had to give us closure on the character of Katniss as well as some sort of closure on this screwed up society, but too much of this book focuses on the completely unimportant love story and the establishment of a rebellion that really isn't all that interesting because all the good moral debates about that very rebellion don't come into focus until the final chapters.  To conclude, I may have some harsh words for this book, but to any readers who would consider reading this: do it! I liked the book, just not as much as the other two. If, like me, you find the first half of the book to be a bit of struggle, please push on, because the conclusion is worth it, and you deserve to know what happens.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I love Evernote. however, my Kindle Fire just ran out of juice while I was taking a note and I lost the last 3 hours of notetaking. this would never happen on my iPad or on my desktop. What a terrible bug, making this app unreliable and worthless. How unfortunate. I guess we are expected to save and reopen a note every so often.<br /><br />go ahead and get the app if you are a loyal evernote user.  but be prepared to lose notes in the event of a minor catastrophe, such as a forced shut down by low battery.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love most of the games on here. They are a ton of fun. I have a few problems with this app though. First, you need to know that this is a challenge, not a game bundle. Earning points from the other games is how you get all 101 games. The amounts you need.per.game eventually gets a little ridiculous. Also the controls are not the best, but are bearable. The most annoying thing about this app is all the ads. But the games are a lot of fun and I like the challenge of having to unlock new games. If you like a variety of games, a good challenge and are not bothered by ads I highly recommend. this app.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|This isn't your typical animated film. You will know that, right when the enigmatic Mr. Fox first appears on screen.

B005NQ5LSC|4.0|True story: I was first put on to the whole Ip Man series by an online friend who told me that I absolutely had to see the films because \\"they're like a cross between SCHINDLER'S LIST and ENTER THE DRAGON!\\"  While I found the comparison more than a little off-kilter, I did see the first film, simply titled IP MAN.  It was released in 2008, and it told the story of Yip Man, a grandmaster of Wing Chun martial arts and - as I learned - the man who trained the legendary Bruce Lee.  (So I finally understood the comparison!)  It was a fascinating story - with incomparable fight scenes - set against the Second Sino-Japanese War.  It starred Donnie Yen as Ip Man, and, to date, it spawned one sequel which also starred Yen, but now \\"the legend is born\\" again in IP MAN: THE LEGEND IS BORN with newcomer Dennis To taking the central role as a much younger Ip.<br /><br />(For the record, it's worth noting that the first IP MAN was nominated for 12 awards at the 28th Hong Kong Film Awards, so, yes, it's quite good, fighting and all.)<br /><br />LEGEND revisits Ip Man's story by transporting the viewers back to the man's youth.  This new installment follows the young man as he begins to understand his fighting prowess.  In a town ripe with political corruption, the younger Ip Man sees all that he stands for threatened, so he stands up alone against these local `forces of evil' to protect his temple and his honor.  While this earlier film only hints at the charged political situation between Japan and China that takes center seat in IP MAN and (I'm told) IP MAN 2, I can say with some assurance that you needn't have to see the earlier films to appreciate the story here; there's enough background provided so that LEGEND can be a comfortable `jumping on' point for anyone.<br /><br />However, that's perhaps what I missed between the first IP MAN and this reborn LEGEND.  The first film had a clear villain for the grandmaster's conflict.  When the audience understands the source of the conflict, it's much easier to appreciate how the narrative unfolds.  Ip's \\"adversary\\" isn't as clear in this film, and, at times, I found that a bit of a distraction.  It's a much different story - one without as direct a requirement to showcase the man's fighting philosophy and skills.  That doesn't make it a \\"lesser\\" picture in any measure; it's just that some of the \\"history\\" felt a bit more dramatically contrived than perhaps it was based on the circumstances of Ip's later life.<br /><br />Sure, there's fighting, but one of the fight scenes (a racist Westerner insults Ip Man at a field hockey match) feels inauthentic, though it very well may've happened.  There's a bit of love triange - almost a quadrangle, if you will - but it gets resolved a bit too predictably and formulaically, a sin to many period-based romances, to seem fully legitimate.  When the film's true adversary is hidden - I don't want to reveal much because I think it fairly \\"spoilerish\\", suffice it to say that spies of a certain nature are definitely involved - it's sometimes unclear who Ip Man's real allies are here.  Thankfully, it's still told with much of the same flair as Donnie Yen's earlier contributions, and newcomer To almost seamlessly steps into these younger shoes with similar styling and physical charisma to the central role.  In fact, it's amazing and refreshing to see such physical grace onscreen these days when so much of the filmmaking process has been reduced to post-production special effects.<br /><br />The picture quality is excellent, the choreography is mind-blowingly incredible, and the production detail is superb.  The disc comes with a \\"making of\\" feature that could've benefitted from greater direction, but that's a small quibble.  What's real movie magic here is the story - the exploration of a key figure in the mastery of Wing Chun against the backdrop of history - and the film certainly succeeds on that level.<br /><br />Highly recommended.<br /><br />In the interests of fairness, I'm pleased to disclose that the film folks at FUNimation provided me with a copy of the DVD for the purposes of completing this review.provided me with a copy of the DVD for the purposes of completing this review.

0393064476|3.0|Hmmm...my most honest reaction is to say that there were moments when I wished I'd already finished this book and gone on, but there is a lot of intrigue to this one.  Greenblatt basically poses to offer an example of the way Lucretius' worldview works, through the rediscovery of Lucretius' own epic poem that poses a thoroughly deistic view of things, where the gods care little about our lives and the universe runs and changes on its own devices.  Thus, an out-of-work scribe and passionate book hunter discovers the ancient Roman text in a heap in a monastery, and its resurfacing gives credence to humanist philosophy in a culture where the frightened agenda of the Catholic church and its Inquisition will tolerate nothing but total submission to their view of the universe, and how this manuscript tweaks upon those offering an alternate view and becomes a guide towards promoting that paradigm change.<br /><br />Greenblatt's book does suffer a bit of an overly eager desire to fill in dramatically where documentation leaves some holes, but overall I found his method and argument reasonable and tempered with deep consideration of how a more natural way of thought contested with spiritual demagoguery of its day.  Some of the objections I've read, that Greenblatt is out to make Lucretius the sole progenitor of modern thought, seem to work off little more than some connotations of the title alone.  The focus here is of the effect of THIS book towards actual inquiry into the world rather than forced acceptance of a dogma enforced by torture and execution, not an argument that Lucretius alone brought the world out of superstition.  Greenblatt's passion for the argument may sometimes be a little too prominent on the sleeve and his research and conclusions not always convincing, but the story remains a very interesting one to the end.
B001NESPHC|5.0|Melody Gordot is a mixture of old soul in a new body. Quite easily, if she were around 60 years ago, she would have sung the old standards, as easily as she sings her current songs. If you want to be ahead of the curve, buy this CD. This is a relaxing mixture of songs that will cradle you to sleep, or get you in the mood. Her voice is simply very different than most new faces on the music scene. She is very much in the same catagory as Nora Jones. I purchased this CD and immediately went out and purchased her other CD, Worrisome Heart. This lady blends Billy holiday, Ella fitagerald, Julie London, and lena Horne into one.

B00127RAJY|5.0|First, as with any other workout regimen, you really will only see results if you keep with it no matter how hard it gets.  I've been doing this for 30 days now even though it's over the Christmas Holiday and I'm out of town.  So... no excuses.  It's 20 minutes a day, so the exercises have to be challenging.  They ARE challenging at times, but honestly,  it's only 20 minutes a day.<br />Ok, now that being said, this is, by far, the best workout DVD I've ever done.  Jillian is tough, but appropriately so.  She gives modifications, she gives motivation, she talks you through it. I have not measured nor weighed myself, but my pants are fitting better and each day I feel myself getting a bit stronger.  I would recommend this to anyone who won't do the exercises halfway.  There is no reason to do these halfway.  I have a rotator cuff injury that is bad enough to require surgery, and even though I haven't done the surgery yet, I'm doing the pushups and planks even though they hurt.  You just gotta do it... it works!

B0054JZC6E|3.0|This would be a 5 star app if it wasnt' for all the advertisements- and the possibility to accidently hit the \\"Buy\\" button on the main screen. Even for a free app it's just too much- the advertiseing is all over the place! The games are fun and short, so I am going to have to look into the paid version to see if I can like it anymore than I do already- thus 3 stars so far.

B00003CXC7|5.0|Rear Window, directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is well deserving of its #41 spot on the AFI top 100 listing. It is suspenseful and interesting even over 50 years later. It touches on issues we face in our current times. And, perhaps more amazingly, it manages to pass the Bechdel test, something that few AFI movies manage to do! It has two strong, named female characters who talk to each other about a topic other than men. Most movies fail this simple test. In Rear Window, Hitchcock provides equal strength and time to both the females and males in the story line.<br /><br />Stewart is a photographer stuck in a wheelchair, resigned to peering out his windows at his neighbors. In our modern times this might seem a casual thing. Heck, we know the second-by-second details of our far off friends thanks to Twitter and Facebook. However, in the 50s this was considered less of a normal thing to do. He's even scolded by people around him for intruding on their privacy. Amazingly, we really do come to care about these people around him, even though they don't have names. The sad, lonely woman who eats alone and gets roughed up by a guy she brings home. The newlywed couple who goes from bliss to bickering. The loving couple with their cute little dog.<br /><br />Even when Stewart gets concerned about an invalid wife who seems to go missing, he's still being caught up in all the dramas around him. The song-writing guy and his piano. The ballerina with her bevy of admirers. The whole courtyard is fascinating.<br /><br />I love how Kelly shows her strength and surprises him with her independence. I also cringe when her quite astute observations are dismissed as \\"women's intuition\\" - as if they are not based on logic.<br /><br />I do find the ending to be a bit contrived. The killer was an extremely logical, methodical man who planned out every last detail of what he was doing. He knew there were multiple people aware of what was going on. Why in the world would he try to kill just one of them? Surely that would prove beyond a shadow of a doubt his guilt? Why not take off to safety? To me that's the one false note in this story. They needed a more rational reason behind what he does at the end.<br /><br />Still, a great story with a wealth of details. This demonstrates quite clearly the power of creating a rich atmosphere for a story. So many other movies have throwaway background characters who have little to distinguish them. Here we have a rich array of characters who we really care about - and when the ballerina's \\"not a GQ model\\" boyfriend comes home to her, and she clearly adores him, it's richly fulfilling.<br /><br />Highly recommended.of them?

B00514HDNW|4.0|I heard this book was better than the movie from a number of sources...and those sources are all correct.  You dwell into the setting and character development much more. I don't want to spoil it for anyone, but if you enjoyed the movie, pick up the book without a doubt.  If you like post-apocalyptic/zombie/horror books, pick it up also.  Worth your time.

Once he explains the four areas to you, it makes such perfect sense that you wonder why you never thought of this yourself.  I look forward to abiding by the four agreements and I have no doubt that these agreements will change my life for the better!

B004LWZW7E|2.0|We always hear the phrase that \\"time is money\\" and this film takes that to its literal conclusion. A great concept... bu the movie failed to deliver. Justin Timberlake, as someone else pointed out, is a \\"celebrity\\" as opposed to a true actor. He's adequate in supporting roles, but no way was he even close to capable to execute the lead role in this. He didn't portray the emotional range needed, and wasn't believable in the action parts either. To me, this was most apparent in the pivotal scene early on when Salas was gifted with a century of time. The scenes in the warehouse between him and Matt Bomer's Henry Hamilton set the scene for the rest of the film. Unfortunately, the necessary intensity was only there on one side - Bomer's. He made me believe he was a world-weary centenarian. Unfortunately, Timberlake never made me believe in... anything. And to say that there was a lack of chemistry between him and Seyfried would be a huge understatement. If the main roles had been more believable, and well-acted, the plot holes would have been easier to overlook.  There was so much potential in this, but it just didn't work.

B002EEP3NO|5.0|This is an amazing build that took us about five days. I highly recommend the Death Star to parents with kids who have a vivid and very active imagination. My 7 year old son has many Lego sets but this one tops them all. It is so durable and well layered which makes it very heavy but also keeps it from breaking  easily. The most fragile part is the laser. I recommend super gluing it, if you have children. My son loves it and my husband enjoyed helping him build it. It was well worth the back pain and long hours.

B005MIYI3K|5.0|Dark Passion Play was my first Nightwish album, and I loved it. Imaginaerum is quite a different album, less immediate, but there is more to it. Imaginaerum is a theme that runs throughout the album in sound and lyrics and some of the songs have quite a cinema soundtrack quality to them, with some great orchestration.  The songs here are quite creative, and the album is strong overall.     My favourite songs are Story Time, Ghost River, I Want my Tears Back,The Crow, The owl and the Dove.   -Storytime the single is catchy and the bridge really adds interest to the track  -Ghost river has a power metal stlye riff with a dark melodic chorus sung by Marco    - I Want My Tears Back, is a fusion of rock guitars and celtic instruments that fans of Last of the Wilds will love.  - The Crow, the Owl and the Dove is a track written by Marco and is a melodic acoustic track.   - Last Ride of the day is an epic carried by guitars, choral arrangements, intense vocals in the verses and catchy chorus  The other songs are all enjoyable with some surprises. Slow love, slow has a lounge jazz sound to it. Scaretale has a dark carnival sound to it and sounds as though it could be a track from a musical. The last track of the album Song of Myself finishes with an extended poem, which I like, but its a bit awkward in places.

Not that I'm concerned about what others may think or say, it's just not something one tells ....<br />W/ that said, these guys are great song writers. They have essentially mastered the \\"pop\\" hit / MTV format, They can pump out ballads that your mom will like, throw in a few party songs for the stoners, and best of all - hard core stripper songs!<br />60k people may have signed a petition to not have these guys play @ 1/2 time in Detroit, but my $ is on the fact they sell out when they perform there.
B002L5GQGY|3.0|Joe is not an artist. He does not create art because he has no original vision. All he does is ape other players we have all heard to death, although he does this very well. You can't say he is completely without originality, but he has very little of it. He really lacks depth and soul. While I thought all his leads and lines were done well, I never heard one lick that sounded even slightly refreshing. His songs are the same. He sings well enough but the songs are not there.  I like his smooth lines and logical phrasing, but there is simply nothing new there. He has very good technique. I am sure, as his father points out, that he has practiced his ass off. But being a musician, at least a good one that stands out as significant, is more importantly about being creative and not just trying to blow people away with how technically awesome you are. I believe he is still a very immature player who could learn with some more time to make some really good music if he changes his attitude and finds some soul. His last song starts to hint at this possibility. Everything I was gleaning from watching his performance is only cemented by watching the last shot of him in the dressing room. He is arrogant and comes off being rather princessish. He bitches about ruining his suit, cutting his fingers, and throwing away his glasses but lets us know he got five standing ovations and played with Eric Clapton, which he shrugs off by his nonchalant attitude and the off-handed way he mentions these facts as if this is just small time on his way to future greater things. He displays no humility, appreciation, gratitude, nor joy in this last clip, or the concert in general. It's all about Joe. His body language and they way he interacts with his audience through his performance gives him away before you get to this last scene. In his performance he says this is the greatest day of his life, but it only seems to be so he can show the world how truly great he is. It is because he has triumphed in his goal. The whole DVD could be retitled \\"The Triumph of Joe Bonamassa: The Rise To The Top.\\" He has shown the world how good he is and being at Albert proves this. He gives nods to his heroes in his performance and now he feels he stands alongside them as one of the new greats. That's how this concert comes off. It is almost like you are being sold on his greatness and superiority. Sorry to burst your bubble but that isn't the way music works, Joe. You become iconic and an artist because you have vision and have something to add to the canon of music/art that hasn't been done or said before. You can't just simply ape it technically better and expect to be thought of as one of the greats. You need to show a depth of the human spirit, and show possibilities of human creativity that haven't been shown before. Playing faster, cleaner, and more technically amazing will not get you there. If you cannot understand this you will simply end up as one of those guys that carves the Taj Mahal into a grain of sand. Pretty amazing and curious, but who cares ten seconds after you have seen it. The production is good. I find no fault in camera angles, edits, sound, etc. I think if you compare this to the average concert DVD, it is better than usual in this respect. A lot of people will think this concert is amazing because, like Joe, they lack the ability to recognize higher order art. They have been brought up in the West where it is mostly about marketing and superlatives, and how fast you play, and where you play, and how much money you make is a testament to your greatness. The concerts is not bad but it's like white bread, all fluff, air, and packaging. I enjoy white bread once in a while too, like I enjoyed this concert, but you have to take it for what it is. I'd enjoy white bread better if it said, \\"Hi, I'm only white bread but let's have some fun,\\" instead of, \\"I'm among the greatest loaves of bread that have ever existed. I'm so impressed with myself. Look how far I've come.\\"

0545265355|5.0|I'm not a reader. Or at least I wasn't before I decided to borrow the first book from a co-worker. Couldn't put that book down, read it in a day. Decided that I couldn't handle the suspense in knowing what was in the latter books of the series, so I resorted to my lovely Amazon search engine for the whole trilogy. SO MUCH CHEAPER on here than in any book store and in perfect condition. I literally read this entire trilogy in maybe 4 days and I have a full time job and two kids. It's THAT interesting. Seriously do yourself a favor and get this, whether it's for you, a friend, an enemy, relative, whoever. Get it because you WILL read it and love it. :)
1451627289|4.0|finally a very good , just short of excellent Stephen King novel  to all those 1 and 2 star reviewers , only one area i agree with , tooo long , and yes , mr king should leave love and sex out of his books  most of mr king's novels are about small town life in new england , nothing wrong with that , would be nice to live in small towns  sorry , i'm getting a little side tracked  the story is a very simple one , man makes a promise to a dieing friend , without thinking of consequences , goes back in time  well thought out i should say regarding the means of transport..  skimmed a few pages , but all in all good  the betting , his lover being injured , the long dragged out part fictional account of lee harvey oswald could have been cut back a bit  adding the Derry town life and past characters from mr king's one novel could have been left out , though i liked that book too  worth reading the book for what it is , a decent fiction book based on one of the 20th centuries most tragic events  let alone one man's sacifice at the end to make things right  p.s.  i would have liked for mr king to have written a shorter afterward about mr jake epping after he sees his past love at an older age , at least to say he met someone nice and settled down..  to sum up  time travel  a man on a mission  who on more than a few occasions may have changed future events by taking things too far  a love story  ( the sex and long drawn out time from 1958-1963 could have been cut in half , sorry to say )  a few meaningless detours towards destiny...  all in all good , i would recommend a second re read for just simple fiction purposes...  true i have sort of put myself as a positive reviewer , but any fan of fiction , speculative or otherwise should realize it's the author's personal touch that make their books special
B006G2124E|5.0|Although my preference in movies, is more along the lines of action/thriller-  I can safely say this is by far one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time.  I laughed harder watching this film than any other I can remember and at the same time this film tugs on your heart.
B001VLXNLU|4.0|Okay, for reasons I can't fully explain... I'm in love with this series. I'm intrigued about vampirism from a mythological and scientific standpoint. I also like the \\"vampire finishing school\\" thing. Zoey has been gifted by Nyx (yeah, being The Choosen One is unoriginal, but if Z was just regular fledgling, how interesting would the story be? Come on, people!) and has been having family and boyfriend issues. Vampire tattoos, and going through the change is all fascinating to me. Plus, I just like vampires in general. I've read the first six books so far and am still a fan...  Alright, as much as I may like the series, to write a fair review, I must point out some of the series's many flaws. The Casts write things in such a way that is supposed to sound like a teen talking. AND WHILE A FEW REALLY DO TALK THAT WAY, most don't. So, the way things are worded really do suck at times (no pun intended). There are a lot of pop culture references, which really isn't wise of the authors since it takes years to write the series--and a lot can change in that time--but the series takes place over a short span of time. Z can be a little shallow at times, and teens could probably relate with her the most *cough...MAYBE that's why it's in the YA section...cough* but that's not to say an adult couldn't enjoy it as well. If you read into later books, I will admit that the plot is sometimes prolonged unnecessarily, and there are always a lot of loose ends at the end of every book. And yes, every once and a while, the Twins can get as annoying as heck. Sometimes the cussing is a bit overdone (especially with Aphrodite). And there are a few other miner issuses (brown pop, childish remarks like \\"poopie\\", etc.). For me, these issues rarely get in the way of my enjoyment, but they might for yours.  I love this series, including its flaws. I can tell you I'm a hardcore sci fi/ fantasy fan, and pretty well read for my age ( sometimes I read two novels in one day) , and I can also tell you...I'm hooked. But be warned...HoN books aren't for everyone. If you like Vampire Academy books, or even if you don't, you might like HoN books. Even if aren't sure about the series because of a lot of bad reviews, I strongly recommend trying out Marked and seeing for yourself!!!
B006RED4GA|3.0|Big fan of House of the Devil, in so many aspects. The Innkeepers is kind of House of the Devil- Lite. We don't really get a sense of background from any of the characters, which simply leadsto waiting for blood and gore - of which there is about a band-aid full. I love you Ti West, but why was this $10 to stream? Come on now.
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|I want to kick myself for spending my precious vacation hours reading this book with its cliche plot twists and ending.  What a disappointment!  I get the feeling that some authors are required to churn out a certain number of pages and when they reach the magic number they just hurry along and dream up a contrived ending to get it over with.  The tone and cadence of the final chapters was completely out of sync with the first part of the book.
0062101897|5.0|This book is a treasure--lots of behind the scenes info (spoilers for some, but intriguing for us), stories about how the casting was done, how costumes were handled, AND GREAT photos. A terrific resource about how the films were made. Love it! We got it from the library and HAD to buy our own copy.
B000ICL3KG|1.0|\\"ALGORE\\" has made millions preaching about the damage we are doing to our environment - all the while doing the very things he says are destroying it. He preaches we all need to be vegans because all the beef and animals we're consuming are creating too much atmosphere-damaging flatulence. Then, when the cameras aren't on him, we see he's eating burgers and steak! He flies around in his private jet (you ought to hear his statistics on what air transportation is doing to the environment) when he's not limo-hopping, and he lives in a mansion that consumes as much energy as 19.5 average homes!! All the while... the media does their best to spread the liberal religion of environmental conservation!!! Yet, when the TRUTH is finally revealed in hard facts, it is either downplayed, or ignored completely by the media who relentlessly attacked the messengers of the story. In case you missed the 20-second media report, I'm talking about emails that were hacked from the University of East Anglia's Climatic Research Unit. This facility plays a leading role in compiling reports for the United Nations regarding long-term climate changes in the Earth's environment. The messages from the unit's director, Phil Jones, discussed ways the research unit MANIPULATED DATA that failed to comply with the \\"establishment view that climate change is real and is being driven by man\\". In the messages Jones discusses \\"hiding the decline\\" in long-term temperature changes from those climatologists who aren't drinking the Al Gore Kool-Aid. Another message revealed Jones' attempt to control the publication of research carried out by global warming scientists who were known \\"skeptics\\". One way of accomplishing this would be to take the panel of researchers who review papers prior to publication, and \\"load\\" them with Kool-Aid drinkers who are \\"on-message\\". I guess it's safer to surround yourself with Kool-Aid drinkers who cannot think or question anything for themselves. When asked, Al Gore refused to debate his claims with the climatologists who are debunking his junk science. Yet in spite of this, you didn't see any attacks on \\"ALGORE\\" or even a single debate between experts of differing opinions. Had emails similar in nature been taken from a conservative think tank demonstrating this level of deception, I ponder to think where it may have gone in the media. One last tidbit... my favorite \\"Algore Fact\\" was when he was speaking before his flock and made the statement that the Earth's core is \\"millions of degrees\\" (in case you're unaware, the surface of the sun is less than 10,000 degrees)! So if you want to watch a movie designed to do one thing - raise money - then have at it. Just be a little open-minded to the fact that 99% of what you're watching is mixed with 1% of truth - just enough to fool you and get you to open your wallet!

It felt as if I were jammed in a center seat in economy class with very little leg room.  Being much more of a cat person than a bird person probably didn't help much but I found Franzen's anti-cat rhetoric very tiresome the first time I encountered it; intolerable when it was repeated.

0380820846|5.0|The love story in book 3, Benedict's, was love at first sight; Benedict and Sophie were knocked off their feet before they even said one word to each other. For Colin and Penelope, the opposite happened. They've known each other for years, he a popular Bridgerton, quick with a smile, or always letting his sense of humor show. Penelope, a shy girl, always a wallflower, has accepted that she'll have to love Colin from a distance, while she lives the life of a spinster.<br /><br />One of the many things I'm loving about this series, is how each sibling has found love. For Colin and Penelope it might be the most touching story so far - and yes I've said that with the first three books as well, but to know someone for years and finally SEE them, whether it's because Colin changed, or Penelope, or both of them, they grow together first as friends, then realize that they can't imagine their lives without one another. It was really the sweetest journey for them. They had a little bit of angst to get through, but it was nothing that their love couldn't overcome and sometimes, you don't need to have huge angst in a story to make the romance work. This story was all about their relationship and finding their way to each other, after only knowing friendship for so many years.<br /><br />Colin has so many layers to him, and it's not surprising. So far, we had only seen the playful, adventurous Colin, who is witty and fun, and takes off for parts unknown, loving to travel and see the world. But inside he's struggling to find his place. He doesn't have that \\"thing\\" in the world that he can point to with pride and say, this is mine, this is my accomplishment, this is something that I've done that I'm proud of. It bothers him deeply and only Penelope comes to understand this about him, even though he is a bit jealous of her and her secret accomplishments as a writer.<br /><br />Colin has a bit of a temper (who knew!!) but he doesn't have a mean bone in his body and even as he tries to find a purpose in his life, and takes it out a little on Penelope through a little jealously, he loves her fully, and her support for his own writing helps him see a side to himself that he was scared to take a chance on. Her approval and kind words mean the world to him, and for Penelope, to see the outgoing Colin as vulnerable, made her (and me) love him even more.<br /><br />Ahhhh Penelope. So many times throughout the book I wanted to cheer and clap for her. She's always been the wallflower, if for no other reason than she found herself so uncomfortable in crowds that she has a hard time expressing her true self and letting her real personality come out like she's able to with those closest to her. That part of Penelope was so easy for me to relate to - who hasn't had the experience of fighting for words when you most need them, only to have the perfect come back or simple comment well after you needed it? She's a sneaky one though and has been keeping a secret from everyone in her life for years. Colin finds out the truth, and while initially his main concern is the impact it will have on Penelope if/when the truth comes out, he wants no harm to ever come to the woman he loves, this is also the source of the jealously he feels. It causes a couple of bumps in the road, but Colin loves her. Simple as that and he'll do whatever it takes to make her happy.<br /><br />**********<br />And then Penelope did the one thing that could break his resolve in an instant. She looked up at him, deeply into his eyes, and uttered one, simple word.<br /><br />\\"Please?\\"<br /><br />He was lost. There was something heartbreaking in the way she was gazing at him, as if she might die if he didn't kiss her. Not from heartbreak, not from embarrassment - it was almost as if she needed him for nourishment, to feed her soul, to fill her heart.<br /><br />And Colin couldn't remember anyone else ever needing him with such fervor.<br /><br />It humbled him.<br /><br />It made him want herwith an intensity that nearly buckled his knees. He looked at her, and somehow he didn't see the woman he'd seen so many times before. She was different. She glowed. She was a siren, a goddess, and he wondered how on earth no one had ever noticed this before.<br />**********<br /><br />This is really just the best love story, start to end. And while all these books are stand-alones, it packs an even bigger punch if you've read the first three books and get a small taste of who Colin and Penelope are before their story, especially seeing what Penelope's gone through; suffering through embarrassing balls and moments that no poor girl should have to deal with. I ended the story with happy tears and completely, 100% satisfied with the journey and story that Colin and Penelope were given. Simply wonderful and I'm already feeling a bit sad that I'm now officially at the half way point of the series. Four more Bridgerton's to go, but there will be many rereads coming up!e'd seen so many times before. She was different. She glowed.

There are many more options offered...although I wasn't aware that a lot of the apps are not free ones. For the money, though, it is a better buy. She loves it. Also, Barnes and Noble is wonderful at Tech Support. They helped her get it all set up!
B005EZJ3MW|5.0|Loved Demi since she debuted and was heartbroken to hear about her struggles. Her comeback album is brillant. It has dance songs and personal songs as well. All her lyrics are extremely relatable. He voice is astounding. The notes she can hit are unbelievable. I recommend this CD to anyone who has liked any of her songs or is a girl between the ages of 14 and 34.
B001BPQT8A|4.0|This is a brilliant movie, by all means necessary. Fincher's vision on most all movies he's touched just bring to life amazing stories, so this is to be expected. I was looking forward to owning this Blu-Ray copy of the movie, but after two copies not working on either of my PS3's, I noticed that my PS3 wasn't the problem, but this Blu-Ray, for some awful reason, just will not work with PS3. Disappointed by the movie not working, but will praise Amazon for replacing my product the next day. Unfortunately, it was an exercise in futility, as the replacement copy still didn't work on PS3. The movie itself gets 5/5 stars, but the technical difficulty that disables PS3 play brings this product's value down for me.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|Being familiar with Keane's earlier work, I understand why some fans didn't take to this third album.  The sound is markedly different from the piano-heavy tunes of Hopes and Fears, but I for one wasn't put off by the change.  The lyrics on Perfect Symmetry are meaningful and beautifully composed, and the melodies are catchy and memorable.  The album is still all Keane, but with a new spin.  Maybe I'm a biased fan, but there isn't one Keane song I dislike.  And that holds true for Perfect Symmetry.  I wish people would give it a chance.  It's a wonderful collection of songs from an amazingly talented band.

To clarify, it sounds as good as Jon Cleary, one of my personal favs.  Some Laurie songs are even more so 'polished' than Cleary & work their proverbial way up the judgmental ladder competing with another fav of mine, Ramsey Lewis.  Kudos to Hugh Laurie. ~rhonda
B001JNNDEW|5.0|The humor in this movie is timeless and for anyone who works in an office I bet you can relate to many of the characters in this film. It was hard for me to rent because it was alway \\"out\\" so I decided to buy it. I don't buy many movies since I seldom watch them more than once but this is one I can watch over and over. The price was great especially for Blu-ray!

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I have been looking at the reviews of Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins. So many others seem to share the same opinion on the ending. One even says he wishes he could re-write the end himself - wish I'm tempted to do. Closure. That's what I need. You can't write a Trilogy and end it like that. The whole book more of droned on, I kept reading - hoping for something different, a change in plot...something interesting. Collins left me hanging. She killed Finnick in a sentence, as well as many others, who played heartwarming roles, as well as humorous. Why kill off characters, as if you were picking berries from a bush? Collins picked one too many berries. And we were left with a bush - with only two real berries left. Katniss and Peeta. And even then - they were bland, boring berries at the ending.  Although she may have wrote Mockingjay a bit more realistic - realistic is not the material captivating readers wanted. We wanted adventure, we THRIVE on the adventure, and love triangle. A ending - a clean ending. And Closure. This was not closure.

B000V39KDO|1.0|Another ridiculous movie based on a comic book. What a colossal waste of money and talent; and to think that a movie version of Stephen Pressfield's stunningly excellent book, Gates of Fire, could have been made instead of this rubbish.  Historical accuracy??? Where to begin. First of all, at the beginning of each year the Spartan council passed a law that all Spartan men shave their mustaches. In this atrocity almost all men had full beards, including mustaches. The movie accurately describes the Spartans as being unbelievably well trained to hold a line and move as one (protecting the man to the left with shield) and then shows most battle scenes as individual combat. Even at the end (Battle of Plataea) it shows the 10,000 Spartans running pell-mell into battle. No, no, NO! The terror the Spartan army instilled in their enemies was that they came on slowly in perfect step, inexorably, to the accompaniment of flute music. If they ran, it was only the last few steps, to slam into the ranks of the enemy. At Thermopylae, they held the Persians for 2 days+ precisely because they presented them with an unbroken wall of bronze shields bristling with 8 foot spears held OVERHAND (not underhand as in this movie). The Persians didn't have elephants there, nor rhinoceroses, nor were they stupid enough to charge a line of spearmen with cavalry. The Persians were a handsome people, not ugly as depicted here. Xerxes didn't look like a bling-bedecked, hip-hop pimp (like George W he wanted to finish what his daddy started at Marathon); the Persian Immortals didn't wear chrome plated masks nor have hand grenades. I could go on and on. If you like a gore-fest of severed limbs, decapitations and enough blood splattered to please a Dexter, by all means see this garbage!
B006O5Y0SS|1.0|UGH. Allen can do anything he wants and he has done genius work. Then there is this. Time travel as a plot device for self discovery? Romantic relationship nobody can possibly understand? Paris as a place to save it all? Sorry. Even Allen cannot get away with just about anything.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|I got this cd the FIRST DAY it came out. I was excited for weeks for it to come out. After I received it, I was very impressed. I've been a fan of his since the very beginning, but since his voice has changed he sounds so much better. Not that he didn't before. He just sounds much much more mature now. I love almost every song on this cd. Silent night, and his duest with mariah carey aren't my favorite. I love love love Drummer Boy and All I Want Is You. They are absolutely amazing. Anyone who says this boy can't sing, must have hearing problems. He is so so talented. He wouldn't have been hired if he wasn't talented. All the work he's doing for charity too is just amazing. It shows that not all celebrities are ignorant. He used to be poor, and now that he's able, he can help out the less fortunate. He is just the total package and this album is amazing.

B00000295A|5.0|Let's face it. The music world of 1993 was very very divided. There were those concerned mainly with matters of media credibility and those interested in the creation of their particular art. On both ends of the pond soul and funk music at this time generally wasn't created. It was being programmed. That mixed with the whole credibility situation wasn't making for much harmony. Than came a British fellow named Jason Kay (known as Jay) and a talented quartet called Jamiroquai. Putting themselves out there in a mix of other groups in the \\"acid jazz\\" genre (often used as short hand for most varities of funk) with people such as Brand New Heavies and Incognito this band didn't exactly have the jam band tendencies of the former,nor the house/dance leanings of the latter. But they did something very special that meant a lot to myself personally.<br /><br />  Equally capable of top notch musicianship and melodic invention,another thing Jamiroquai understood was the value of instrumental production. The music is well mixed,with the right touches of reverb and echo when needed. Basically it's going for a 70's jazz/funk/soul sound that's produced authentically. Jay's vocals,long and very incorrectly compared with Stevie Wonder have a high to mid range lilt about them that are elastic enough to fit these songs. A better musical comparason might be Curtis Mayfield,especially the soul stepping funky soul groove of the opening \\"When You Gonna Learn\\" and it's environmentalist poetry. \\"Too Young To Die\\" extends to a similar groove with a more anti war message. On \\"Hooked Up\\" and \\"Revolution 1993\\" it comes out what fantastic musicians they are well with polyrhythmic jazzier funk grooves with a more instrumental leaning.<br /><br />  \\"Music Of The Mind\\" is similar though on the more mid tempo end of that area. Headhunters style clavinet type stop/start funk is prominant on \\"Whatever It Is,I Just Can't Stop\\" where as \\"Blow Your Mind\\" has this lean sophistifunk sound with Jay's scatting George Benson style with the violin. The band also did for the digeridoo in funk what EWF did for the kalimba: to bring it into the consciousness of the bands sound and hopefully the listener. The title song,with it's disco friendly dance-funk sound reprises the environementalist concerns where \\"If I Like It,I Do It\\" again brings the Mayfield/Impressions type funk/soul to the forefront. Although clearly under the wing of his influence,it was likely too many comparisons that commercialy doomed this band. Jamiroquai stand as very much their own musical animal. Sometimes sweet as funk can be,other times as deep in the groove as you could get. They epitomized everything a 90's era funk band could be. And even for the doubters they have,this album stands very very strong.enson style with the violin.

B005MYEQ4U|2.0|What could have been a good film was sadly disappointing. What a waste of effort and money, bad casting, poor storyline, tokenism, weak charactors, etc and why, perhaps \\"the emperor's clothes\\" syndrome? First, the contemporary dialogue and story between the engaged couple and her parents is perhaps an Allen moment and probably one of a wasted effort, fast forward please. Most viewers will have no idea who the historical characters are and many of them just have a cameo appearance which seems too frivolous. I guess Allen wanted to make sure none of the deceased felt badly being left out! Hemingway came across as robotic and strong and Gertrude Stein weak and the rest of the characters were depicted as cartoons (Gauguin, Degas, Man Ray, etc). The scenery of Paris and the music have a redeeming effect for the movie but even the scenes are postcards with little depth. The golden atomsphere and lighting seemed too much since Paris is a city of white light. A year from now this will just be a footnote in Allen's resume collecting dust on a shelf.

B005MYEQ4U|5.0|Even at this late stage of his career, Woody Allen is capable of wringing a few surprises out of his trademark formula, and Midnight in Paris is a treat for Allen's fans and romantics alike, a comedy about wish fulfillment that's magical and touching. Owen Wilson stars as an aspiring novelist who, on a trip to Paris with his fiancée, is transported back to the city's Jazz Age, sharing drinks with Salvador Dali, getting advice from Ernest Hemingway, and finding romance with a beautiful scenester But is our hero's idealized 1920s Paris all that it's cracked up to be? And is his fantasy incompatible with the real world? Wilson is one of the best Woody Allen surrogates ever, with his boundless enthusiasm for the dreamy Paris of yesteryear, and I was charmed by the movie's sweetness.

It's a meaty showcase for such top-notch thespians like Kevin Spacey, Zachary Quinto, Demi Moore, Paul Bettany, Jeremy Irons, Stanley Tucci, Simon Baker, and Penn Badgley, each of who give nuance and humanity to their ne-percenter characters. It's also a strong debut for director J.C. Chandor, who crafts a sleek corporate thriller that milks suspense and pathos out of a bunch of people in suits talking about stuff like mortgage backed securities and marked volatility.

B004EPZ08O|2.0|If you were a tad bit surprised at the release of yet another Final Destination film, I can't blame you, considering the last installment was titled The Final Destination. Then again, the horror genre is notorious for reviving franchises thought to be dead and buried. No, the real surprise here? That Final Destination 5 actually is the best franchise's films. This time around, a bunch of coworkers are saved from a collapsing bridge when one of them has an eerie premonition, and Death slowly hunts them down, one by one. FD5 is the only film of the series that I would even marginally recomend, and while it's still mostly for established fans, the flashes of dark humor and creative death sequences make it more enjoyable overall. In other words, perfect for new year's celebrations.

B004EPYZXK|1.0|On paper, Apollo 18 sounds pretty awesome: it's purportedly found footage of an ill-fated lunar mission in which a pair of astronauts discover a deadly secret. So what went wrong? Well, I found Apollo 18 to be -- gasp! -- kinda boring; despite some eerily suspenseful images, the movie takes way too long to achieve liftoff. Apollo 18 is the only surviving footage of NASA's final moon mission -- a mission that went so horribly wrong that the U.S. Government has denied its existence ever since. But what did those intrepid explorers find on earth's only satellite? I won't give it away, if you are crazy enough to watch it. A boring, suspense-free Paranormal Activity rip-off that feels long even at just 90 minutes.
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|Let me begin by stating that I enjoyed this movie. I would encourage anyone who is interested in the arts (literature, painting, etc.) to see Midnight in Paris. It is a lovely romantic drama that provides an escape from our hectic workaday life.<br />The film opens with a montage of scenes of modern-day Paris, with music of the 1920s playing in the background, which seems just a little too long. The scenes are beautiful and the music hearkens back to a simpler, more romantic time, but the montage just went on too long.<br />The juxtaposition between modern day and Paris in the 1920s (Gil's ideal or Golden Age) was too vague. One of the main themes of the movie is Gil's longing for meaning in his writing career and nostalgia for the Golden Age (the good old days, Paris in the 1920s). For me, there was no difference in the feel of the modern day he magically escapes from and the period he is transported back to: just different clothes and technology and architecture. The film would have been more powerful if more of the ills of modern society (which every generation believes did not exist in the \\"good old days\\") were portrayed. The world which the main characters move through seems just as carefree and luxurious as the Golden Age which Gil longs for.<br />There is, however, a nice lesson in the film, learned by the characters, that the good old days were not necessarily so good to those who lived through them and that every generation longs for a simpler, better time.<br />The point at which Gil realizes that all these individuals (whom he believes at first to be modern people playing dress up and acting the part of characters from the Golden Age) are actually the real, living Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald, Ernest Hemingway, etc. should be a defining and poignant moment in the film, yet it passes imperceptibly. One moment we know that Gil thinks he is in modern Paris, and then we realize Gil is convinced the characters are real, yet his demeanor and behavior don't really change. I don't know if this is a weakness in Owen Wilson's acting or the fault of the director/producer, but I never experienced that wonder that a person would experience when they realize,\\"This is not a dream, these are not quirky actors playing a trick on the public, I am really talking to literary and artistic giants who have been dead for many years.\\" I LOVE Owen Wilson, I'm just not sure he was the best choice for this role. His normal expression when the room is on fire is the same one he shows when he realizes he is in the company of F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway.<br />Allison Pill as Zelda Fitzgerald stole the show. I felt like I was watching the real Zelda Fitzgerald. In contrast, Corey Stoll's performance as Ernest Hemingway was not very good, in my opinion. He  seemed to be a caricature of Hemingway. I felt like I was watching an actor trying to playing Hemingway. Kathy Bates turns in a terrific performance as Gertrude Stein.<br />Having said all that, let me say I did enjoy this movie. I think anyone who is a writer or artist, or enjoys literature and art, will enjoy this movie. I would not laud it as one of the best movies of all time, but I would consider it one of the best movies of the last few years.<br />I recommend (and this is a compliment about the movie) having your laptop at the ready to Google characters and book references if you are not extremely well-read in regards to the authors, artists, and influential figures in the artistic community in Paris in the 1920s (e.g. Gertrude Stein, Jean Cocteau, etc.).<br />I guess in conclusion, I felt like the premise was so good, and there was so much potential in the idea, that I was disappointed in the final product which the producers produced. I had completely forgotten until I was finishing this review that Midnight in Paris was directed by Woody Allen. I'm sure that many people who rave over this movie have fallen into the trap of looking at art subjectively. Whether it is movies orbooks, we often tend to give more credit to the work of an artist who has produced great works in the past than the current individual piece deserves.<br /><br />P.S.I gave this movie 4 stars, but I really wanted to give it 3 1/2 stars. The rating won't allow half stars, and I felt 3 out of 5 would have been insufficient. This is better than an average movie (3 stars), but I'm not sure it is 4 out of 5.more credit to the work of an artist who has produced great works in the past than the current individual piece deserves.

B005OK721G|1.0|A handful of French filmmaker Luc Besson's most famous films betray his penchant for femmes fatale, titles like La Femme Nikita, The Fifth Element, The Messenger, and, to an extent, Leon: The Professional. With Colombiana, which Besson wrote and produced, he returns to the genre with the help of director Olivier Megaton, and the result is uneven. Zoe Saldana plays a Colombian woman whose family was murdered by mobsters when she was young. Now, as a grown woman and a ruthless assassin, she sets out on a path for revenge. If the plot sounds familiar, it's probably because the premise is sort of a staple of the revenge thriller, and though Saldana gives the performance her all, there just isn't enough to set Colombiana apart. The movie not only fails to make an impression, but also suffers from erratic and sloppy filmmaking; it'll probably leave you unsatisfied, but if you've liked any of Besson's and Megaton's recent work, you may still find something to enjoy here.

After all he was a very important part of their sound not just being the greatest percussionist. He is a songwriter, backup singer, producer and Mike of all trades.  Dream Theater found a percussionist as good as Mike and recorded an album to their highest standards. A Dramatic Turn Of Events is a tight wonderful collection of songs that are in no way different than any DT album. I made the mistake of having expectations which I abhor. The only way to really appreciate music is to listen to it without expectations. Dream Theater is one of the most intence progmetal bands out there and they will be for a long time.

030726999X|2.0|... that I finished all three books in this trilogy.<br /><br />I should preface this review by saying that I'm not usually a reader that will delve more than a chapter or two into a book that does not present as compelling. It's not that I am looking for page-turning sensationalism - in fact, quite the opposite. I sincerely hope to be enamored with the language of a story and I adore dense literature. The sheer quality of the writing usually makes or breaks the experience for me.<br /><br />I started reading Girl With The Dragon Tattoo a while back, and quickly abandoned the effort after 50-60 painful pages. There were some interesting elements, and I love a slow and deliberate mystery, but the abysmal writing turned me off almost instantly. It was a bit like bad progressive jazz... lacking both catchy melodies and intellectual depth.<br /><br />Over the holidays my wife and I saw David' Fincher's adaptation and quite enjoyed it. We both felt it was a few elements short of being a great film, but the characters were enjoyable and the mystery was intriguing, if not a tad on the clich&eacute; side. By far the most enjoyable element of the movie was the relationship between Salander and Blomkvist. After seeing the film, I committed myself to giving the books another shot. A few days later I'd read the remainder of the series, and was none too pleased.<br /><br />Others have undoubtedly mentioned the numerous annoyances in the trilogy, including the (unnecessarily large number of) cookie-cutter characters, superficial relationships, needless sidetracking, poor pacing, abandoned and hackneyed plot points, needless redundancy, cheap dealing of information piecemeal, inconsistent perspective, etc., etc. I also agree with the numerous reviews that point out the fact that these three books could easily have been edited into a single tightly composed story if given time and a proper editor behind it. But all these criticisms aside (numerous though they may be) I think that by far the worst crime is the gross under-use of the truly novel and enjoyable element of the first (and most successful) story... namely, the aforementioned relationship between the central characters. It seemed obvious to this reader that the author was more interested in Salander's revenge and ultimate triumph over those that had wronged her than on the infinitely more interesting personal development she saw in the first story (which ultimately seemed to be undermined and forgotten).<br /><br />All I can say about the political, legal, and conspiratorial elements of the last two books is that they were at best tolerable and at worst sorry affairs. I feel slightly embarrassed for having read all the novels, and wish I'd stuck to my initial instinct about the quality of the first book. This may also be the first (and hopefully last time) that I hope to see Hollywood rewrite original stories for the silver screen.<br /><br />I've read worse... but not many.f the truly novel and enjoyable element of the first (and most successful) story... namely, the aforementioned relationship between the central characters.

B005K8QIS0|4.0|I originally saw this on Masterpiece Mystery and really enjoyed it.  I particularly liked the converging plot lines and the inspired casting.  After ordering the DVD set and watching the six episodes (the original Brit series was shot as a six part 1 hour TV series, but shown on PBS as two edited 2 hour episodes) my opinion was reinforced with the observation that the major ingredients of a successful series had been met.  If it was intended just to be a one off cinema production I would have given it 5 stars.  However, if viewed as a longer term series it has some problems.    I can't think of one Brit crime series that has gone on to achieve broad popularity that doesn't have the lead protagonist ensconced in a structured environment or \\"family\\".  Morse, Lewis, Barnaby, Foyle, Rebus and Frost all had a support system where they could play against their \\"intellectually inferior\\" co-workers or rail against the constraints of their organization.  Sherlock had the same in his Watson and Poirot had his \\"posse\\" of hanger-ons.  American crime shows are even more locked into this formulae; just witness NYPD Blue, Law & Order, The Closer, etc.  If you go back in time to where televised \\"Private Eye\\" fiction was more the norm that it is today even the self employed P.I. had his stable screen family to keep him grounded or, at the very least, dealing with conflict issues that added to the character and subplot of these serialized scripts (Rockford/Magnum).  However, those PI feature length films that starred the lone wolf rarely made the grade. Witness the great literary detectives of the 50's and 60's, Lew Harper and Travis McGee.  While the books were serial best sellers for the authors (Ross MacDonald & John D. MacDonald) the movies were mediocre at best.  What's good on the written page doesn't always successfully transcend to television or the movie theatre.    That said, the Brodie character is hanging out there pretty much by himself and I'm not sure that a long distance daughter and ex wife, plus a love hate relationship with his former boss is going to cut it.  They need to come up with a buddy, a stable but competing love interest, or some other friction inducing device and then establish a more fixed narrative as to how he has landed where he has in order to sustain this as a series in the future.  A Tony Horowitz penned prequel that goes beyond the constraints of the Kate Atkinson novels might be just the ticket.  If this is to be an ongoing series I hope year 2  will tell us more about Jackson's past and thereby insure his future.  If they can bridge that divide the series has the makings of a first class production.    And just an aside regarding Jason Isaacs portrayal as Jackson Brodie; how inept does the James Bond franchise look for not wrapping this guy up as the next 007?  He's the first actor since Sean Connery that could wear the role like Savile Row suit and add another decade to a flagging series.

B005HSG3VK|5.0|My 9 year old girl loves it. Very nice. Durable and strong and of course, Pink. Fits well and provides nice protection.
B0053VKP8S|1.0|This converter works like a charm.  It did take me about 15 minutes to get it all situated but I think that was on my part.  The sound quality is just fine coming from the speakers.  I have this hooked up from the digital out on my flat screen and running to some nice computer speakers.  01/02/12 Update - I ordered a second one of these converters for a second tv and it came BROKEN right out the box.  The Upstream/Downstream switch is loose and broken...Have to send it back and then I guess reorder another one or find a different brand...Lost 4 bucks shipping it next day. What a drag...
B005F265CA|5.0|A fun movie with great acting.  A well written script and some very funny scenes.  A good family movie.  Highly recommended.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Information is current and easily found. Much easier than the web site.  I am using a Kindle Fire. The hourly information is particularly useful and the stored locations makes it easy to check on the weather where other members of my family live.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Kelly,  I love you music  :)  Thank you for your support for Ron Paul. We need more people like you in this country. Keep true to your beliefs and in the Lord Jesus. I am a military Veteran and thank you for standing up for our country and Constitution and waking up to all the lies being told about Ron Paul.
B0044RFTD8|5.0|Came just in time for Christmas!  Great quality...and we love watching the movie!  Was very excited to share it with the family.
B006JTS5OO|5.0|I am suprised by the several reviews I read that stated negativity about this movie. It's like getting teeth pulled to get my husband to the movies (especially a 'kids' movie') and he said it was probably the best movie he's seen in 5 years! We all laughed all the way through. In fact, I think I had a permanent smile on my face the whole time. I cannot wait to own this on DVD. Bravo Disney!!!
B000UR9QHQ|4.0|Got this movie for my wife and it's cool... Love HD I would get it to bring Halloween to another level...

B0063IH60K|5.0|I downloaded this game for my kindle fire. It works great! I waist too much time playing. The cards move smoothly and the game flows very well.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Before reading please consider that with probably 200+ purchases on Amazon this is the first time I've felt the need to post a review to defend the quality of a product.  I am absolutely baffled by the negative reviews for this case. Perhaps they were completed before the video showing it's usage or something. The whole purpose of the case is to be as slim and lightweight as possible while still protecting the Fire. It does just that. You won't find something that adds less size to your fire while still covering all the parts you actually want covered.    On my old second gen Kindle I find myself consistently removing the case so that I had something a little slimmer. That's not something I see myself ever doing with this case.  Cannot recommend enough if you're going for a slim case.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love it on my kindle fire. I m truly addicted. very challenging and brainwarping. cant get enough. wanna do it over n over
B00664C0PC|4.0|Competetive eating in all its disgusting nature made the python look friendly.  It was fascinating since I was not aware such exhibits ever happened.  I never guessed the murderer.
B00650SSWG|1.0|This is so poorly written. It was like watching paint dry. Good looking actors, but after 30 min of   this thing going nowhere it really starts to get boring. So, Justin and Mila roll around in the sack   constantly, but it is not even interesting or sexy, it is just a total yawn. I had to turn it off at about  60 min into it, because I was falling asleep and it appeared to have no end in sight. Spend you money on something else. This was just a complete waste of time. Justin should be more careful about the movies he takes on, as he is still building a reputation as an actor and this one does not help!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is perfect for anyone who likes to have fun it is easy and really entertaining I love that it has a winning deal option so that if I'm not so good I can start easy. over all I think this app is much more than worth trying it is spectacular.

B0063IH60K|5.0|love playing solitaire on my kindle fire!!  I had to throw away my handheld game. Always needed batteries and couldn't see too well.
B005CS3WO6|5.0|Been a fan of these lads since I was 9 yrs old. I grew up listening to this amazing boy band in a third world country all the way till now when I moved to the States.  I remember the first moment when I fell in love with these guys while accidentally saw their video \\"Uptown Girl\\" on MTV. (and back then MTV was a real deal, nowadays all I see is just saggy pants, gold grillz, chain hang low, and shakin booties)  Westlife music is not something that you crank it up high, shake your head, and start break out dancing. There is no \\"swag\\" whatsoever in their music. That is not how you listen to Westlife. Their music is all about heart-warming love ballads. The kind that you can turn it on in your car and just sit in there, close your eyes, lay back your head, and just hum along.  Every hits they make, and every lyric they sing, I swear they all are still here in my head dated back in 1999 with the singles such as: \\"If I Let You Go\\", \\"Swear It Again\\", and \\"Flying Without Wings\\"... The kind of music that can last for a lifetime if you truly are a fan.   Don't believe me? If you call yourself a music lover in America, how about try to sing the first verse of the following songs:   \\"Goodies\\" Ciara  \\"Crank That\\" Souja Boy   \\"Whatever you Like\\" T.I  \\"Low\\" Flo Rida  or even \\"Empire State of Mind\\" Jay-Z ft. Alicia Keys  Still remember? Or you don't even recognize any of them? Let me tell you a hint. *They're all #1 hits on the Billboard Hot 100 in the U.S not long ago. The kind that got kids in High School go crazy back when I was a student myself.   I admit some of those hits are quite catchy, but music in the U.S are short-lived. They rose to fame on the Billboard for a couple of weeks, and then they are completely forgotten afterward once they got taken over. Even if you're still hang on to those songs, would you feel OK to turn it up loud in your party? Or even in your car with friends riding with you? How would your friends think about you? That your music is awesome? Or youare \\"Old-Skool\\" still listening to those \\"lame old\\" beat? And then quickly hit the \\"Next\\" button searching for the next song that is a little more \\"current\\"?  Anyways, back to the lads. Except for the time period when I was still living in a third world country where they sold no official release CDs, I bought all of their album releases from Back Home (2007), Where We Are (2009), Gravity (2010), and this one Greatest Hits (2011). All through Amazon of course, because Westlife doesn't exist in USA.  Living in the U.S, it is very hard for me to answer the questions \\"What kind of music you listen to?\\" \\"What's your favorite artist?\\" My friends ask me every time, and my answer has always been the same: \\"Westlife\\". The reaction is always: \\"Who the h*** is Westlife?\\" (not a surprise). I never try to explain who these lads are to them. I just put on \\"My Love\\", \\"Soledad\\", \\"Us Against The World\\", or \\"How To Break A Heart\\" for them to try out. As the result, their reaction afterward is also always the same... THEY LOVED THEM ALL!!!  Westlife. My band. My music. My life. Doesn't matter that this is their final album, I will continue to support these lads to the best of my ability despite I am living in a country where no one knows who they are.  W4ever,
B006JPS1OM|4.0|haven't played a lot yet. that's why I only gave it 4 stars for now. it gets you interested from the beginning.
B0063IH60K|5.0|love solitaire! great relaxing game. easy app to have on phone and fire. reminds me of playing as a kid.
B003O97W5K|5.0|Excellent movie now seen High Def video. Bonus features are excellent also. A must have addition to your collection of sci-fi movies. Highly recommend it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love to start my day playing this on my Kindle Fire. it becomes addictive. I love the ease of play and the annimation.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|It snaps on nicely and has already been worth the money spent on it. Looks good and adds some meat to the Kindle for holding.
0307888681|3.0|I'd been really waiting to read this one. I love a good zombie story. I got to give this author major credit for creativity. Each interview was truely unique and obviously well thought out and I thought researched pretty well. On the downside, there was no connection to any of the characters, there was no suspense, and there was absolutely nothing to hold you to the book. Awesome way to deliver the story though. Just wish there'd been something to hold onto and keep this one near and dear for a while. It didn't do that for me.
B001EC3JME|5.0|It does exactly what it says it will. I have had it attached to a back pack for over 18 months now and it has not failed once. The only complaint I have is that it holds my light a little too tightly and it takes 2 hands to remove it...not hardly a reason to knock a star off though. Must have if you are the kind of person that likes to keep a flashlight handy and secure.
1451627289|5.0|So far this is a wonderful book. I have gotten swept up in the story it is moving really fast. This is a great book that takes you on the adventure of going through time.
1863514201|4.0|Love this book. The illustrations are delightful and the directions more than clear. Has some nice projects for the beginner without looking like a beginner.
B005HV6YO8|4.0|My mom is a huge Sting fan - so this made the perfect gift. She was super excited to receive and has been listening to it non-stop ever since.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|You can't go wrong with The Holiday! It's such a great movie - this is actually our third copy that we have purchased because I think we may have worn the other two out by watching them so much.
B005QI4TP8|4.0|After seeing and hearing Florence and the Machine for the first time on SNL earlier this year, I had to get the cd. It's actually a great cd and didn't have to skip over the songs like I have on other cds I purchased without really knowing who the artist was...definitely wasn't disappointed.
B002M9WW30|5.0|Thanks!!! Shipped/received fast. Great price as usual. I always know when I order from amazon that it's a safe purchase.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I bought your album not only because it's great music, but because you have the courage to stand up for liberty at the risk of ridicule by the media.  You are a heroine in my book.  Ron Paul 2012.
B003QNXPUK|4.0|Does an awesome job at protection but definitely not custom fit for the iPhone 4s. There's just some slight differences on the sides and the front. But covers what it needs to cover so it's good enough. Challenging to apply. If you run out of the spray stuff, just refill it with diluted dawn dish liquid detergent. Make sure you're in an area with the least amount of dust particles. It's so easy to stuff stuck inside. You might not even notice until after the application.
B005MYEQ9U|5.0|Anna Netrebko as Anna Bolena is amazing to say the least.  She truly captures the full range of emotions of the doomed queen in both her acting and her singing.  Elina Garanca is wonderful as Seymour and Elizabeth Kulman was brilliant as Smeton.  The music is awe-inspiring in this set.  If you are a fan of Bel Canto opera or just a fan of Anna Netrebko, this is a MUST HAVE.  I have to say, however, that I much prefer the production (sets, costumes, and character interpretation) of the Met, which I hope they will release as well...my fingers are crossed.  The Vienna production of this set is minimalist and a bit abstract, which is okay, given the superb cast they had to work with.  However, there was such a richness of authenticity and story in the Met's production which I felt was largely absent in this production.  I thought Gubanova's interpretation of Seymour (at the Met) as a more tortured/conflicted lover much more powerful than what often feels like Garanca's \\"ice queen.\\"  During the first act her portrayal of Seymour seems terribly calculating and uncaring.  It isn't until her duet with Anna and later with Enrico that Garanca acts out the anguish and confusion of her character...in this she was convincing and made her interpretation of the character work.  I also found Costello's Percy much more powerful, at least in terms of characterization/acting. Meli's singing is wonderful, but he often seems to just deliver the lines with little of the emotion Costello used so effectively.  However, all of this probably comes down to personal taste.  In the end I would be happy to have both productions, as both exhibit opera at their best.
B00650SSWG|1.0|too hokey and silly for me.  after seeing Justin in a few other flicks I thought it would be more than this.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Great album that has a unique sound and lots of replay value.  Something new to have in the music collection.  My favorite track off of Torches is easily \\"Houdini.\\"  I highly favor \\"Call It What You Want\\" and \\"I Would Do Anything For You\\" as well.  \\"Helena Beat\\" is catchy and \\"Life on the Nickel\\" is quite a unique composition.  The album is over-all very upbeat and something you could either listen to while dancing/working out or to play while you are working on something.  Highly recommended.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evermore is just as awesome on kindle as it is on my iphone. love it much!  And now I'm just bloviating to take up space so I can submit my review.
B0063GORYU|5.0|graphics could be spittle better but overall a great version of this game! I'm addicted to it myself. good download
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game helps kill time at work and my kids really really like to steal my kindle fire to play it.
B005LY4B0A|3.0|Perhaps the most frustrating thing in this game is its inability to tell which web strand you intend to slice. An undo function would make this more forgivable, but replaying a level several times because the game doesn't sense where you want to cut most definitely cuts into the fun.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This is an excellent series that we did not know about until we saw it on Amazon.  We were not sure we would like the series but the description given by Amazon appeared inviting and we thought we would give it a try and are pleased we did.  We would make this puchase again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I couldn't put this down the minute i started reading it. Mind it that i see tons of reviews about young teens being emotionally scarred from this book. I'm a 14 year old girl and have never had a nightmare or thought about the deaths in a scary way.  The book brings you into this different world of starvation, sorrow, and death, in a place called District 12. Hunting is the only way most of the people of the Seam make it through the day. Which is punishable by death.  The book was surprisingly cute. I mean, who doesn't want a guy like Peeta Mellark, the boy who gave Katniss Everdeen bread, to be theirs? Especially when he declares his love for her on live television before the games. Through so much death, and devastation, they * SPOILER ALERT* find a way to win the games and go back home. The only thing that annoyed me a bit was the ending.   In my opinion, I never really liked Gale all that much. He was too much fire for Katniss. So when she said she * SPOILER ALERT AGAIN* couldn't understand her feelings for either of them, which caused Peeta to become heartbroken. Leaving Katniss even more confused.   I've read the trilogy in a matter of days, but i wont say anything else. Too many spoilers already. This book was one of the most talked about books the last two years at my school. Now, that the movie is coming out, everyone is re-reading them for like the hundredth time.  Overall, this book is one of my favorites of all time. The lasting love in the middle of a battle and beginning of a rebellion is perfect because i wouldn't read just an action book. But i cannot stand romance novels.   If anyone has actually had the time to read this review, thank you so much. To Suzanne Collins, thank you so much for creating the hunger games, without this, i would probably still be reading vampire novels. This has opened my mind to different types of fiction and i am great full for that!(:
B006JJ9JE4|5.0|I downloaded this number one series on my new Kindle fire.  The picture quality is outstanding as well as the quality of the picture.  It was very easy to download and buy and lived up to the description given by Amazon.  I would make this purchase again.
B005ZUR724|2.0|Ok, I got this on Christmas. Played it a lot, and had a lot of fun. I open it and I can't. update it. Is gameloft going to fix this? I also got a six month sub. so this is basically a waste of money. If you are about to get this wait. Once the update is done buy this game. Great MMO that's portable and you can play it even when you only have 15 minutes. Gameloft!FIX THE UPDATE ISSUE!!!!!!!!!!
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|I've spent many hours of free time spinning gems with this app. The shapes make it an especial challenge. I strongly recommend checking it out!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|interesting various games for all ages can get repetative at some times but with the buying of new games keeps things fresh
0425238091|5.0|I'd heard about this book for years.  But how good could it really be?  Answer - it's fabulously good.  This is a brilliant book about a young doctor's reaction to starting out in the medical profession treating patients.  Clearly he chose the wrong line of work (and quickly switched to psychiatry.)  I only wondered if all interns react as he did or whether its just the ones who shouldn't have been there in the first place and had to find out the hard way.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Stronger...what a great title for this CD.  Kelly, please keep speaking your mind and most importantly, support LIBERTY and FREEDOM for peace loving people like us.  Doing so will make us all stronger.  If you do, you can always count on me to be a fan of your work.  5 stars!!!
B000BB1MI2|1.0|I grew up watching the original version (I don't even really see this as being a remake, rather, a far different adaptation).  Recently I decided to rent that original version to watch with my son, who is 5.  He asked to watch it again the next day, and went around singing the oompa loompa song ever since.<br />Fast forward a month, and I decide to rent the Depp version, out of curiosity. I immediately (before Depp ever hit the screen) felt it was not even remotely as engaging as the 1970's version. Once it progressed to the factory, I was completely disinterested.  My son, sitting next to me, also became restless, and after the squirrel scene, asked if we could turn it off and read stories instead.<br />For the record, while I have read much of Dahl's works (and love his style), I have not yet read 'Charlie-', so I can't speak to whether this version is more accurate a portrayal of the book.  But I CAN honestly say, that even if I had never seen the original movie, I would have been as disappointed in this one.  I love Tim Burton's 'Nightmare', and have seen many Johnny Depp movies.  I guess those two things made my experience here even worse, because what I expected and what I got were like night and day.

B003O5MO6G|5.0|After the bold (for '66) experimentalism of FIFTH DIMENSION, the Byrds could have gotten \\"weirder\\" or could have consolidated their gains.  They chose to do the latter on the follow-up YOUNGER THAN YESTERDY, which had a touch of the \\"retro\\"(for them) in their Top-40 take on Dylan's \\"My Back Pages,\\" while the other single from the record, \\"So You Wanna Be A Rock'n'Roll Star\\" reflected their growing musical diversity (interesting--and telling--that a song ABOUT rock'n'roll should feature S. African jazz trumpeter Hugh Masekela).  \\"C.T.A-102\\" continued the \\"space and sound effect\\" novelty tradition established on the previous record's \\"Mr. Spaceman\\" and \\"Lear Jet Song.\\" while Chris Hillman's \\"Time Between\\" suggests the C&W direction the group would take a few years later with SWEETHEART OF THE RODEO.  FIFTH DIMENSION is often referred to as the Byrds' \\"trasitional\\"  album, but YTY serves as ample proof that the Byrds were always in transition.  And not just in terms of personnel.  They had already met the challenge posed by Gene Clark's departure during the initial stages of FIFTH DIMENSION (he's featured on \\"Eight Miles High\\").  McGuinn and Crosby had already assumed the songwriting chores on that record.  Now Chris Hillman was joining their ranks and contributing some very strong initial efforts (\\"Time Between,\\" \\"Girl With No Name\\" and the less overtly country, \\"Have You Seen Her Face?\\" and \\"Thoughts And Words\\").  One wonders if Hillman had suddenly penned these in a burst of creativity or had had these songs in storage for years waiting for a chance to get them out there.  Having established themselves as something more than Dylan popularizers on the previous record, they were free to once again include a number by the Bard of Hibbing without diminishing their own reps as songwriters.  Well, David Crosby (ever the gadfly) risked diminishing HIS reputation with his little bit of avant-gardery (and \\"deep\\" poetry) \\"Mind Gardens.\\"  For folks who liked their Byrds songspretty and Crosby on high harmony, this 3-minute bit of doggerel and dissonance was a little too much.  One does well to remember that before CD's and random select, the track was immediately followed--and complemented--by the Dylan track \\"My Back Pages,\\" which was superior lyrically and harmonically, but was still \\"heady stuff\\" like its immediate predecessor on the album.  (A tip of the hat to R. Meltzer for pointing that out--in his comments on the \\"turkey tongue\\" in AESTHETICS OF ROCK, some 40 years ago).  And speaking of sequencing, it is not inappropriate that the original record closing track brought back a taste of the \\"raga-rock\\" first experimented with on FIFTH DIMENSION. This is a re-recording of the McGuinn-Hillman track that had served as the b-side to \\"Eight Miles High\\" and (in concert with which) suggested that the band was taking off in a bold new dimension.  The single version never did ultimately make it to the vinyl version of FIFTH DIMENSION (it would later show up as a bonus track on the CD), and the version recorded for YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY, while still relatively exotic, is less fevered than the original.  Things were calming down a bit and, as mentioned, kind of coalescing.  The Byrds' gorgeous harmonies and often jewel-like songs (check out \\"Renaissance Fair\\" on this record) belied the bitter strife and acrimony the group was experiencing internally at the time, well, it just goes to show you what pros they were.  McGuinn and Crosby, whatever their differences, were still capable of co-writing effectively, as \\"Renaissance Fair\\" attests.  But a quick look at the credits suggests that McGuinn was already shifting to collaborating more readily with Hillman.  But while the album was something of David Crosby's official swan song (he would appear on the next several singles and about half of the next album NOTORIOUS BYRD BROTHERS, he is well represented here--WHATEVER you may think of \\"Mind Gardens\\"--with the cool, jazzy vocal on \\"Everybody's Been Burned,\\" the aformentioned \\"Renaissance Fair\\" and on bonus tracks \\"It Happens Each Day\\" and the between-the-albums single \\"Lady Friend\\"--a commercial dud maybe but an artistic success, in my book.  His melodic gifts and high harmonies would be missed, but the Byrds would soldier on.  From here on in you couldn't keep track of the players without a score card, but always worth a listen.  But the trio of albums from FIFTH DIMENSION to NOTORIOUS BYRD BROTHERS constitute what is arguably the artistic high point of their career.  And YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY is the mid-point of that high-point.  Which makes it something of a landmark record more than four decades later.

(A tip of the hat to R. Meltzer for pointing that out--in his comments on the \\"turkey tongue\\" in AESTHETICS OF ROCK, some 40 years ago).  And speaking of sequencing, it is not inappropriate that the original record closing track brought back a taste of the \\"raga-rock\\" first experimented with on FIFTH DIMENSION. This is a re-recording of the McGuinn-Hillman track that had served as the b-side to \\"Eight Miles High\\" and (in concert with which) suggested that the band was taking off in a bold new dimension. The single version never did ultimately make it to the vinyl version of FIFTH DIMENSION (it would later show up as a bonus track on the CD), and the version recorded for YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY, while still relatively exotic, is less fevered than the original. Things were calming down a bit and, as mentioned, kind of coalescing.  The Byrds' gorgeous harmonies and often jewel-like songs (check out \\"Renaissance Fair\\" on this record) belied the bitter strife and acrimony the group was experiencing internally at the time, well, it just goes to show you what pros they were. McGuinn and Crosby, whatever their differences, were still capable of co-writing effectively, as \\"Renaissance Fair\\" attests. But a quick look at the credits suggests that McGuinn was already shifting to collaborating more readily with Hillman.  But while the album was something of David Crosby's official swan song (he would appear on the next several singles and about half of the next album NOTORIOUS BYRD BROTHERS, he is well represented here--WHATEVER you may think of \\"Mind Gardens\\"--with the cool, jazzy vocal on \\"Everybody's Been Burned,\\" theaformentioned \\"Renaissance Fair\\" and on bonus tracks \\"It Happens Each Day\\" and the between-the-albums single \\"Lady Friend\\"--a commercial dud maybe but an artistic success, in my book. His melodic gifts and high harmonies would be missed, but the Byrds would soldier on. From here on in you couldn't keep track of the players without a score card, but always worth a listen. But the trio of albums from FIFTH DIMENSION to NOTORIOUS BYRD BROTHERS constitute what is arguably the artistic high point of their career.  And YOUNGER THAN YESTERDAY is the mid-point of that high-point. Which makes it something of a landmark record more than four decades later.
B005KELQEU|5.0|I was devastated when I broke my original Kindle.  I ran to replace it immediately worrying over whether the three new books I just bought would be saved.  The new Kindle is smaller, lighter, just as comfortable to read, and has a very small learning curve.  AND...all my books were right there in my Kindle account on Amazon!!  The price was right and I love it as much or better than my old one!
B002UZ5CHO|4.0|A nice little peek behind into how our food is made.  Really enjoyed it.  (Now I need to think about how to interpret/isolate/adjust for the slant. :-)
B00447G29S|5.0|My package was delivered on time as usual,and it was everything I expected.  3D movies are a bit over priced but its pretty much expected since this is new tech for the at home viewer,and there is little to choose from in 3D right now. This movie was good in 3D, as you would expect from animation,now Im ready for some action movies.
B005ZUR724|1.0|I hope I get my $ I spent on this game refunded to my amazon card because I did love this game &amp; was an avid player but now it says that I have to update when there clearly is no update. So please fix this game fast or refund my $
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|To Kelly Clarkson,  I have been a fan for a long time, but I haven't bought one of your albums yet.  In honor of your dedication to Liberty and to the Constitution of this Nation and the Spirit of America, I just purchased it and can't wait for it to arrive to share it with my daughter.  You are a role model and may God bless you in all you do!
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|this games is boring and there are lots more exciting games to play and not waste time playing angry birds just because it is popular
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I work the midnight to 8 shift, found out this helps when 6 am rolls around, it id hard to control some of the games, but cant complain too much a little frustration keeps you awake so I give it 3 stars.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like Angry Birds...also,I like turtles. As a matter of fact,I am a turtle! :) Also...well I don't know. I just needed more words.
0064440346|5.0|Thanks Arnold Lobel for such a wonderful book! I remember reading your books as a kid, and am now enjoying them with mine.   My son picked this out as a book for him to read to me. He's 6 and is having a difficult time with reading at school. This is perfect. It's a step up from the traditional level 1 books with large type, and not as hard as some of the other level 2 superhero books. He loved that it has chapters. The words are perfect for him and repetitive enough for him to start memorizing. He is going through this and the Frog and Toad series, and when we're in between books he always goes back to this one. He loves it. Highly recommend!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|easy but not a fan of earning points.  wish I could access all games and earn rewards or badges as opposed to earning points to unlock games
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I never listened to your music before, but I am all for a musician who will put her career on the line to help bring true freedom back to America. For your bravery, your a true patriot. I bought your album for my 20 year old daughter who loves your music and now respects you also. I won't hesitate to buy your music in the future. You got a new fan and strengthened the loyalty of another fan. Can't wait to get your album.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is so cool u have 101 games in 1 app I love this I would recommend this to everyone even grownup will like this game
B0063GORYU|4.0|Loved playing Spider on my PC, now I can take it with me on my Kindle Fire.  Do yourself a a favor and download this app!
B005H0IW6W|5.0|As always, Michael has come out with another great album.  A new twist on some of the classics.  Will be listening to it long after xmas!
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this app. Beware it is pretty tough, though. On each stage I can only get past level one. It is kind of a strategic game. It requires a different kind of thinking. If you keep working at it you'll get the hang of it. Over all it's an awesome app!
0060007737|1.0|I'm surprised by the good reviews for this book. I've worked in advertising for 12 years, and I'm always picking up books to try to keep my thinking fresh and discover new ways of talking about my field with my clients and colleagues. I've found plenty of wisdom from books that (like this one) are targeted toward a beginner audience. But this book is just plain flat.<br /><br />First of all, it provides only the most superficial and generic picture of the branding process, with few practical examples or applications (and even those that are included are afforded just a cursory glance). There is little practical advice for the average business (that is, any business that is NOT FedEx or Amazon.com or Volvo). The book's 22 chapters are not so much immutable laws as banal bumper stickers.<br /><br />Chapters 16 and 17 (on logos and colors) particularly bother me. In fact, they are nothing but complete and utter bulls**t. The authors may know a thing or two about branding, but obviously have never developed a successful brand IDENTITY, unless by pure accident.<br /><br />But the worst part of the book is that nearly half of its weight is taken up by the appended \\"11 Immutable Laws of Internet Branding\\"... which is split between needless rehashing of the same points covered in the original volume, and hopelessly outdated prognostications on what the Internet will someday become (\\"someday\\"... as in five years ago; the volume was published in 2002, and it shows).<br /><br />However, \\"22 Immutable Laws\\" does offer a plethora of well-written, quotable sentences that will no doubt make you look smarter in a meeting. Here are the best, so you don't have to wade through the book yourself:<br /><br />\\"What is a brand? A singular idea or concept that you own inside the mind of a prospect.\\"<br /><br />\\"Everything a company does can contribute to the brand-building process.\\"<br /><br />\\"You have to reduce the essense of your brand to a single thought or attribute.\\"<br /><br />\\"Think like a customer and your brand will become more successful.\\"<br /><br />\\"What you think of your brand doesn't matter. It's only what your customer thinks of it that matters.\\"of your brand doesn't matter. It's only what your customer thinks of it that matters.\\"

B006BDHAX0|5.0|If these problems were fixed, I would give this app 5 stars. However the app suddenly closes very often and even froze during one game. Uninstalled from my Fire.<br /><br />Edit: The app has been fixed since my last review. It seems to be working fine now on the Kindle Fire.
B006FTCH2E|1.0|\\"Another Earth\\" really disappointed me.  I thought it was going to focus on the \\"other earth,\\" but they barely touch on it.  This movie could easily have been made without the Earth 2 aspect.  In fact, it has been made hundreds of times and much better in movies such as \\"Return to Me\\" and books like \\"Jane Eyre.\\"<br /><br />Instead of focusing on the other Earth, we get two dull caricatures who could have come from any chick flick. There are lots of scenes of the Rhoda, the main character, staring into space with vacant eyes, haunted by her past.  The director shows the male lead in mostly dark shots when he's unhappy and bright shots when he's happy.  He spends most of his time drinking, in darkened rooms.  Some of the scenes are laughable they are so cliche.<br /><br />I suppose this would have been a 2 star movie for me, if I hadn't felt misled by the preview.  I wanted to learn a lot more about the other Earth.  I don't mind overlooking the science of these sorts of movies, but learning more about the other Earth would have been far more interesting than the two boring characters on which this movie focuses.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|Husband really liked receiving this as a christmas gift.  I know some people had an issue with the packaging but its not a big deal to us and the video is just fine.
1416585710|2.0|I won't write a long review complete with quotations from the book....I'll just say that overall it was very disappointing. I literally had to force myself to finish it, hoping there would be some reward at the end. There wasn't!  The book simply didn't engage my imagination all and it didn't provide any type of connection with the characters. Even the piebald creature seemed one dimensional.  Disappointed....but still a big King fan.
B004XQO90E|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie when it came to theater, so I decided to get it on Blu Ray since it warranted having great action sequences. I am typically pretty picky with what I purchase on Blu Ray anymore simply because a lot of older movies almost seem as though they are just transfered directly from DVD to Blu Ray with no remastering.<br />This was not the case here, Playing on a 1500 dollar Blu Ray Player the movie was great! And the DTS HD Master Audio really was great!! So I guess if you are trying to decide which way to go, definitely pick Blu Ray when choosing this Movie.
B006C1DH92|5.0|This game is the best. It's challenging and fun! Very fast and great graphics on Kindle Fire. I would recommend this to ANYONE.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|These are my favorite kinds of games. The graphics and game play are great, if not a little slow at times.
B005HSL626|5.0|I have a Kindle Fire and the graphics are just amazing. This game is really addictive because you get to earn different blades and backgrounds. I really recommend this game to anybody who loves action. GET THIS GAME!!
B005ORVN1Y|5.0|The new mix of Signals is great to hear after all of these years of loving the record anyhow.  Alternative vocals and other elements are awesome and Alex's guitar is much clearer.  The songs were always great, Alex was just buried a bit too much beneath the keyboards.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great graphics and very addicting. Fun for all ages. It gets challenging but it's very fun and great to play.
B006C1DH92|4.0|Other than being a large program (21.4MB) for my crappy LG Optimus One, it's a really fun addition to the Fruit Ninja library.
B00526ZKYS|3.0|It's a fascinating world. It's a fascinating character study. But the only way I could have enjoyed how things were resolved would be if I had already gone through the Procedure. I was drawn in enough that I will look at spoilers for the next books in the series, but I won't willingly go back to this world.
0061784788|1.0|The Devil Colony is the latest of James Rollins \\"comic book\\" novels.  Having read the earlier novels and noticed the continuing move from literature to cartoon, I was not surprised to find a plot so bizarre as to make the entire treatise totally unbelievable.  Rollins, however, has become a devoted advocate the Clive Cussler method of writing...find a theme (The Sigma Force) and a couple to characters like Painter Crowe and Gray Pierce who are most happy to be cartoons; throw in some juvenile additions (like the supposed niece) and the totally ridiculous villain and you can milk these strange, twisting plots for every penny you can make.<br /><br />Creative...Maybe.  Good writing...Not a chance!!<br /><br />I am most happy to say I will not read another Rollins book.
B0063GORYU|5.0|this app is great. it works as well as or maybe even better than my home cpu version. love it
B006BDHAX0|2.0|The game is alright and about what I would expect, but clocking in at 13.5 MB and not able to be moved to the SD card is a deal breaker.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This product is a great value for the price. I looked at other stores for a cover for my Kindle Fire and they were all so expensive ($40-60) for the quality of the cover. It's lightweight and easy to put on.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|I'm so happy with this headset.  It doesn't hurt your head or ear after gaming for long time periods.  The microphone is crystal clear and there's no delay seeing how its wired.  The cushions on the ears are comfy and the top head strap is too.  The cord is ruffly 10 to 12 feet long.  The only problem is that you can barely hear anyone in or around the room.  You could be screaming in your mic. and you could barely hear yourself outside the headphones.  You hear the people in the game perfectly fine but nothing else.  I also like these because you don't have to have the sound on your TV or radio on and the headset channels in game sounds to the headset.  You hear people walking in the game because this headset picks up that tiny bit of sound.  Overall an awesome headset for gamers.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It keeps me busy. I play it too much. it haunts me by night, taunts me by day. beware of the spider.
B005NKIQ26|5.0|I resently got this for  Christmas. I love it and if you like Justin Beiber then you will love him singing all your favorite Christmas songs! Wonderful you should totally get this!!
030788743X|4.0|I really enjoyed this first novel by Cline and the homage he makes to 80's nerd and pop culture. I may have been slightly too young to appreciate every reference (my gaming experience began with the NES), but he does a nice job of describing the old text adventures, cartoons, and coin-ops. There is also a dystopian vibe to the book that I enjoyed. The virtual world, OASIS, is a brilliant mixture of virtual reality and MMO. One of the things missing from the book are compelling relationships between characters. At times, the interactions fell flat, in addition to the writing in general. However, since it is a work of sci-fi, these issues don't detract too much from my enjoyment of the book as it was a page-turner. If you enjoy dystopian themes, or the gaming and nerd culture, especially from the 80's, it is a fun and provoking read.
B004SBX112|5.0|this app is totally awesome. it is totally ad-free. way better than angry birds classic. if you're an angry birds lover buy this.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Review by my son:  \\"One of the best series I have ever read. It stays with you, till the end. Ebook formatting kinda ok. And  last book was outta the groove, still amazing conception.\\"
B004T4LUPW|4.0|I've been a longtime user of (Pocket)Informant but I don't use all the facility of PI and wanted something simpler and that would sync with Google Calendar and Tasks (including indented/subtasks). CalenGoo is the only app I've found so far that does this well. I'm very happy with it and recommend it highly. I use it on both my Asus eee tablet and my Mororola Droid Bionic w/o issues.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|My son loved this complete set, and I loved the price.  It was received much quicker than expected and well packaged.  Thank you!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought a Band of Brothers box set from another seller on here, and the DVDs in that set turned out to be damaged in ways that weren't apparent at first. I checked over all the episodes on the DVDs in this set, and there was no skipping, pausing, or stalling. I'm glad to have a replacement set of DVDs.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app has all the options you need.  It has nice fluid graphics which makes the playing experience excellent.  Try it.
B006BDHAX0|1.0|I thought it was a free app. its 99&cent;. What a dumb, stupid,  app. I recommend that no,one gets this. But if it becomes free then get it
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use Evernote on Mac, Pc, iPhone and now Kindle Fire as well.  Tonight I created a massive to-do on my Kindle just to see how it worked and I have to say I LOVE IT!  Thanks for making it so easy to reach all my notes on my bajillion devices so easy.
