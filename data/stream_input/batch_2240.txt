B0036S4B6M|4.0|Piper explains her year with such detail it made me feel as if I did time with her. At times the book was a bit slow, but I assume so is time in prison. I highly recommend this book for those who are interested in memoirs.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|This is the best story ever! There is so much dramatic tension and plot. Just because you have seen the movie doesnt mean you know the story, there are so many more layers in the book.
B001P5M7QE|4.0|Plenty of memorable fun moments in this Monty Python classic.  I shared it with my 13 year old and I don't have any reservations about a teen or late preteen watching this movie.  A mildly suggestive scene in the castle that houses only women is tame by 2013 standards.  Some violence with blood that is absurd enough to be comedic and acceptable to most 12 to 16 year olds.  This is a delightfully stupid movie and it helps if someone in the room has seen Monty Python before so that you can help explain to newcomers the disjointed, time warping, Python style of story telling.  The &#34;monster&#34; in the cave scene is a classic that was just as funny now as it was decades ago.  If possible watch &#34;And Now for Something Completely Different&#34; by Monty Python first and then watch this second.
B00AH34AUQ|4.0|Strong singalong melodies, varied song types and overall pumping cohesiveness. Well done, gents. This is the closest Green Day has come to replicating the solidity of American Idiot, by moving past.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I am still wiping my tears as I was writing this review.  I was devastated and heartbroken.  This is one book that will haunt me for a long time.  It was so beautifully written, witty, hilarious and a very different kind of love story.  Will Traynor was a young, wealthy executive who had an accident that had left him become a quadriplegic.  Lou Clark was his inexperienced caregiver who got the job for 6 months.  Will wanted to end his suffering with euthanasia and Lou was on a mission to change his mind.  I finished this book in 2 days.  I even wanted to cancel my lunch date with friends so I can just stay home and keep reading.  I laughed and cried, ended up with puffy eyes after I finished.  This is a highly recommended book and will be perfect to become a movie.
B0043VDIAG|5.0|It has a very good plot and as the story unfolds you want to read more of it. Definitely a book you can't put it down. The characters are OK, even though I would have like a more emotional approach.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|Loved this book; great themes, and it flowed so well- I wanted to keep reading to see what would happen.<br />Inspired me so much, I made nosegays for each lady in my book group!
B00AY0A71I|4.0|This is a funny movie from my young adult years.  Lots of laughs and twists that keep it interesting, but it is ultimately frivolous and devoid of any redeeming morality.  I would not recommend this for teens or preteens; it is too sexually charged and amoral.  If you can suspend your good sense enough to accept the faulty premises and lack of integrity in all these thieves and murderers you will get many good laughs.
B0059XTUEK|4.0|I think this movie was very good. Michelle Williams is hauntingly beautiful and a dead-on Marilyn Monroe impersonator. Kenneth Branagh looks nothing like Lawrence Olivier but delivers a great performance as always (and totally sounds like L.O.). Julia Ormond as Vivien Leigh...WHAT?!?! Worst. Casting. Choice. EVER. Seriously, whoever made that decision should be fired. Otherwise, though, the film was quite enjoyable and gave us a glimpse into Marilyn's crazy little world. I am interested to read the book it was based on.

B00A1AF4DM|2.0|Silliest book ever from Crichton and Preston should be ashamed! However, this would make a totally watchable SciFi movie of the week. I would have preferred to read a non-fiction book from Preston about bug and bark chemicals with a foreword from Crichton.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I personally love this app, bit after a little bit, it would crash every time I would open it. So I took my friends advice and then deleted it and downloaded it again. It worked well, and today, it crashed AGAIN. I am frustrated at this so if you have a kindle fire, I advise you to not get this app. If you have any other device, it is very fun and better quality than Temple Run one. I reccomend this to non kindle users!

0345803485|5.0|I loved this first of the three novels the best.  It's exciting and the explicit sex, while shocking at times, flows right along with the plot and, unlike other books by the wanna be EL James' authors of this genre, it is an integral part of the story.
B0051OZ564|5.0|This movie has great special effects, everything had such detail. The girls looked like they had combat training! Good choise of music. This movie requires at least 2 or more viewing to catch all the detail, like the flying bridge, the dragons movements showed gravity which is sometimes over looked, and the rabbit painted on Ambers fighter was perfect for the playing of &#34;White Rabbit&#34; in the backround. I don't often write reviews so this is rare. Thanks, Chris
1904994768|5.0|This book is the ultimate record book for all things gaming. With the many records, the awesome scoreboards by Twin Galaxies, and the overall awesome creation, this book is the one to get.<br /><br />Though it may be 2012's Edition, it still holds records that may not have been shown in 2013's.<br /><br />I recommend this book to gamers who want a challenge.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|so far its cool no bugs yet and the graphics are ok for an app..it needs to have better flow but that only matters to gamers

B007SNFTAI|4.0|At the beginning of the book Ford lets us know what events are going to happen, but you have to wait and wait to find to who and when. His descriptions of the south west corner of Saskatcewan could not be described any better. I could see and feel it. The story itself  took a few twists that were maybe a little unbelievable. I rated the book on the writing style more than on the story. I would recommend it .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this is so awesome and I already am in Rome and I at least have all the characters in the me section I just think its so awesome
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Fun and easy way to pass time! My nieces l love playing and sometimes I spoil myself and purchase extra coins, they are not expensive. I have had no problems, and just like to play for a nice, mindless wind down.!
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|I have always loved these movies which obviously why I purchased this set. I wanted to address the packaging woes some have expressed. I personally think the packaging is pretty good. It is a sturdy cardboard boxed set. Where the cardboard meets the business side of the disk it has a glossy smooth texture which shouldn't harm the disks. Some have said that the pockets are very tight and nearly impossible to get the disks out. Mine holds the disks snugly enough to keep them from falling out but allows me to slide them out with little or no resistance. The only one that resisted at all was the pocket for the bonus disk and it was only slight.<br /><br />This leads me to think that some folks may have gotten sets that came from a batch of defective boxes where perhaps too much glue was used in the packaging making them much tighter than they should be. Sometimes things like this happens to a whole batch of items. I bought a movie several years ago I had to return to the store three or four times because I kept getting copies where the bonus features didn't have any audio.<br /><br />I am sorry for those who got bad packaging, but mine for one turned out good. So hopefully if you buy this set yours will too. Good luck!
0345803493|5.0|I loved that it picked up just right where the first one left off.  You find out so much more of what makes the hero tick and why he is the way he is, he really is a heart breaker.
0307341577|1.0|I barely was able to finish this book. It did not have one character that had any personality, I get that it was from a dark place but even then you need some shred of personality or humor or kindness or at least humanity. None of that was there and the writing itself was disjointed. I hated it and really want my money back!

B002QS5OQ4|2.0|I don't know if it's the alleged HD transfer from Amazon Prime or poor cinematography, but the lighting seems poor and the sets are cheap.  The plots are wildly uneven, some fairly interesting and others not so much.  The two main protagonists are difficult to like at all.  This is more like Battle Star Galactica (2), but not nearly so clever.<br /><br />Amazon's streaming video is heavily posterized and the audio is merely stereo.  For free, it's okay, but I would not pay extra for this service.  No where near HD broadcast quality.
B000FC1QQU|5.0|Another interesting book with gentle, caring people.  No foul language, no sex, no violence.  Entertaining without offending.  The stories are always intriguing.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This is really a  great book for people of all ages I was waiting for this book for awhile and when I got it I had a blast with it
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I love the authors' use of storytelling to educate us about finding DevOps maturity.  What a breath of fresh air to gain so much valuable knowledge from a book that is also a pleasure to read!<br /><br />There's not a character in The Phoenix Project that I don't identify with myself or someone I know in real life... not to mention the problems faced and overcome by those characters.<br /><br />I am also amazed how very complex and mature manufacturing processes were presented simply but clearly, then applied to the chaotic and immature world of IT Operations.<br /><br />The Phoenix Project has moved to the top of my recommended reading list.  Thank you, Kevin, Gene and George for another career transforming book!
B002VQ7PVS|5.0|I just finished this book, and I highly recommend it to fans of the \\"spy story\\". I see that some reviewers have complained that most of the characters are one-dimensional; I believe that was deliberate, to make the main character stand out in higher relief. I enjoyed the device of the diary, peeling back the past a bit at a time, leaving the reader eager for the next installment. I also found that knowing in advance that Eva survived her adventures in WWII did not noticeably lessen the tension for me when her memoirs revealed times of danger; I still was on edge to see HOW she survived.<br /><br />I particularly enjoyed the day-to-day details of spycraft in the BSC; apparently this is a real hook for me, it was that which drew me into \\"Eye of the Needle\\" back thirty+ years ago. The humdrum, everyday existence, suddenly thrown into danger and intrigue. Indeed, I consider this book almost a companion-piece to \\"EotN\\", the British agent's side of things, albeit mostly in a friendly country, not enemy territory. This is a book that manages to put the reader back in that now-distant time - and makes you really enjoy your stay.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|i liked this game for a couple days but then it got boring<br />if u want a fun running game get subway surfers<br />i think temple run 2 is still pretty cool it has a zip line a mine and waterfall but it repeats alot<br />:(
B009MCRHH6|3.0|A great premise with good graphics and sound. Gets very repetitive too quickly. Needs more variation to the game play.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great! Subway Surfers has the layout of Temple Run & the addictive-ness of Jetpack Joyride(almost).<br />Except for the stressful limited things,it is insanely good.
B007L5GDGW|2.0|The response time is awful and it's hard to get past the first couple of platforms. Great concept but it needs work.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I had a very hard to time getting in to this book, the beginning was a little slow and it did not engage my interest right off the bat.  Normally if I can't get in to a book after the first couple of chapters I don't finish it.  I am glad that I stuck with this one about half way through I real started to enjoy it, and was glad Pat got his silver lining at the end even if it wasn't the one that he was expecting.

0545403359|4.0|Book Review: War Horse by Michael Morpurgo 4/5<br /><br />I've always wondered about these books, I'm not that interested in books about animals but when a set of three was available from Tesco I decided now was the time to try them out.<br /><br />It took me a while to get into War Horse as it's written from the horse's perspective.  Very weird.  However, it works.  It follows the horse through the first world war and is very informative on the atmosphere and uses of horses.  There's plenty of emotional content too with people associated with the horse and characters both human and equine are well drawn.<br /><br />One draw back though, for the story to be told the horse has to understand English and German.  Now that is one talented horse, most humans can't do that!  Other than this the book is enjoyable and really highlights the difficulties of humans and horses during that terrible war.<br /><br />Gail Jones<br />Author of Family Secrets
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Wanna get away? This is an easy escape from reality. Enjoy the story line for what it is. Its not Jane Austen; it's a welcome twist from the paperback romances.<br />To the reviewer that challenged the author on her geography, she is spot on.<br />Q

B0089LOKHG|1.0|I loved the first two books and waited patiently for this one.  Characterization was abysmal aand terribly underdeveloped. While I enjoyed the Lena/Hana viewpoints the ending was wretched.  I honestly thought I had missed some pages the ending was so abrupt and just didn't really make sense.  It's like the author just got tired of the story and decided to stop.

B00340LM8C|5.0|Beautiful location and beautiful people...  combine that with the mastery of Alfred Hitchcock's directing and you have a classic movie not to be missed!  The magnificent location on the French Riviera, stunning color, brilliant plot, gorgeous costuming, and superb acting make this one of my all-time favorite movies.  Cary Grant and Grace Kelly are perfect in their roles, but just as perfect are the supporting cast, especially Jessie Royce Landis as Kelly's mother and John Williams' as the insurance inspector.  Does it take a thief to catch a thief?  You must watch and find out!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|Many musicals have failed the transition from stage to screen.  This does not.  The script and some of the characterizations are DIFFERENT from the stage play. But I've seen the play more times than I can count, and I would have to say that I have seen bigger differences between one professional production and the next.<br /><br />Before this came out, I read the book, then rewatched the Liam Neeson version and tried to watch the Michael Rennie version.  My conclusion from reading the book is that there are so many characters, so much backstory, so many Dickensian plot twists, etc. that ANYBODY who can make a single coherent story out of the thing without it being ten hours long deserves great praise. By the way, if you question this sentence, try reading JUST the Wikipedia plot summary - it will leave your head spinning, and it leaves out numerous characters to whom Hugo gave backstories and plot arcs, as well as several plot twists.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed the inclusion of visual elements that were compelling in the book but which would have been impossible or distracting to present onstage.  These include the decrepit war-memorial elephant in which Gavroche lives, the geometry of the streets and buildings where Enjolras and his comrades erect the barricades, the bottomless pit in the sewers that nearly costs Jean Valjean and Marius their lives, and the confluence of watersheds into which Javert leaps, ensuring his death.  Other changes that folks have found disturbing express the spirit of the book, even if they're not technically from either the book or the play.  This includes Javert showing Gavroche honor at the end.  Frankly, I don't mind that the director used that original scene to replace a whole (and somewhat silly) chapter that shows Javert's growing crisis of conscience.<br /><br />The \\"reviewer\\" who complains that Anne Hathaway played Fantine as TOO miserable obviously hasn't read the book.  Or paid attention to its title, apparently.  With the exception of Russell Crowe, who seemed to hit one emotional note and maybe three musical notes throughout the entire movie, the cast was well-chosen and each brought their \\"A-game.\\"  By the way, this is the only Eponine I have ever found truly sympathetic (most never get beyond pitiable).<br /><br />Some have chosen to complain about plot elements which seem weak in the play and still seem weak on the screen, such as Marius and Cosette falling in love \\"at first sight.\\"  Well, \\"A Heart Full of Love\\" is not my favorite song ever, but it's better than reading Hugo's FOUR chapters about why \\"love at first sight\\" happens.  Again, kudos to both the play and the movie for successfully bridging that gap and many others that are even more awkward in the book than they are in the play or screen.<br /><br />Thanks again to the musical producers who managed to get a coherent, compelling presentation out of a massive, complex, and sometimes contradictory tome, and to the movie producers who managed to be as true as possible to both the book and the musical while still making a ridiculously good movie.  - Paul Race, School Of The Rockexception of Russell Crowe, who seemed to hit one emotional note and maybe three musical notes throughout the entire movie, the cast was well-chosen and each brought their \\"A-game.\\"  By the way, this is the only Eponine I have ever found truly sympathetic (most never get beyond pitiable).<br /><br />Some have chosen to complain about plot elements which seem weak in the play and still seem weak on the screen, such as Marius and Cosette falling in love \\"at first sight.\\"  Well, \\"A Heart Full of Love\\" is not my favorite song ever, but it's better than reading Hugo's FOUR chapters about why \\"love at first sight\\" happens.

1105495957|5.0|It is hard to point out the specific reasons why this book has so much appeal when many literary memoirs can be so dry and boring.  First and foremost it has to do with the subject material, poverty in early 20th Century England and France, and the comic indifference in the manner that Orwell takes all of the crazy events that occur around him. At times he turns the work into essentially a street survival guide in which he offers up tips that make you shudder, smile and shake your head in amusement that people actually choose to live like this. That is one major point of emphasis that is absolutely astonishing, Orwell willingly submitted himself to this tramp lifestyle, and lived among these people like a wild-life researcher in the wild.  The characters themselves are classics that instantly drill themselves into your memory and have you clinging to every detail that Orwell recalls about their past, present and plans for the future. A great and eye-opening read.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|A wonderful series depicting British life at the turn of the 20th century.  I love period drama, and this one does a 5 star job of depicting life when electricity and telephones were still new ideas.  The characters and the actors that portray them are loveable.  I finished series 2 feeling like I was leaving an old friend.  I can't wait till season 3 becomes available on Amazon Prime.

One minute I'm laughing hysterically, the next, crying hysterically. John Green has this incredible ability to create characters that you find your self irrationally attracted too. I felt like I knew these characters personally. Even minor character had develop such s profound life of their own. This was truly one of the greatest books I've read in a long time.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|I could NOT stop reading this book. To me, not being able to put a book aside for other - perhaps more important - things in life is the highest praise. If that's true, then this book is among the &#34;best&#34; books I've ever read. There was enough science to keep the science loving geek in me intrigued without being mired in it. There was enough action to keep me looking forward to the next chapter. There was enough character development and self-exploration to keep me really rooting for the hero. I thought the very last page was... superfluous, and I found the rescue to be very formulaic and predictable, but that in NO way took me out of the story. After what the poor guy went through all that time alone, a predicable and simple rescue was long overdue.<br /><br />Let me say it this way... I absolutely love this book and I look forward to more works from Mr. Weir.

1878424114|5.0|I really really enjoyed this book. So much so that it was life-changing. It really made me want to do good. Not because I want good in return, but because operating from a state of love is in harmony with the universe and nature and why wouldn't I want to be in harmony with nature and give good energy and vibes to others? Anything else just seems counter-intuitive to our co-existence as human beings.<br /><br />I really appreciated that the examples used were rich and informative. Unlike many other self-help, law of attraction-type books that use ridiculous or childishly simple examples that insult your intelligence (or don't even correlate to the main point), Deepak uses really amazing analogies that help you understand the bigger picture. I am inspired and I want to live my life according to these laws. I will refer to this book often. Only time will tell if these laws really work, but I am a believer.
B009NQXXZ6|5.0|I will never forget Christmas 1976. Waiting for the premier of Barbra's huge release A Star Is Born. I had read the paperpack by Alexandra Edwards first and became hooked on the idea of a rock musical starring Barbra (who was just the singer who sand The Way We Were to a clueless 14 year old.)  I bought the soundtrack (on vinyl!) on December 18th (made an impression on me) and was beyond excited with the idea of seeing the movie. Well, I went the theaters 7 times to see it over the next 3 months ... not easy since I went alone and it was rated R! I think we all relate to certain movies or tv shows or songsin our formative years and this movie was mine. The timeless story of the unknown singer who rises to fame but who meets the falling star as they cross paths. Barbra's singing was surreal and emotional and powerful ... truly a thing of wonder. I was mesmorized by the sound and tone and crazy heights of her voice then and have been hooked ever since. Buy this excellent Blue Ray copy today. I highly recommend it.

But so does Mel Gibson. LOL.
0393327345|5.0|I like the movie, I liked the book. I have a fight club t shirt and a poster in my room. Book and movie are word for word pretty much, but the book explains more, so if you were into the movie, get the book.

B0086DBE62|3.0|If you are expecting this Movie to stick to the storyline you're going to be surprised.  It is a comedy take on the storyline, and I don't feel that the expression \\"twist\\" is quite strong enough to convey the unique take on this fairytale, it's a little too far out in left center field for that not to be a real stretch on the reality of it.  The Characters, even the evil ones, (Julia Roberts) are very likeable and ultimately that is what holds this movie together.  Bottom line... it's a cute move, enjoyable even, but it is absolutely ridiculous, and an absolute mockery of the original storyline. If the characters weren't so likeable I would have been so irritated I would have shut it off.  So it works, the cast, the script, the execution.  If You allow it to stand on it's own you will be able to sit back and enjoy it.  If you can't let go of the origninal storyline you are going to be disgruntled, but, hopefully at that point the merrits of the characters will be able to draw you in the way that they did me.

B007W8S2MG|5.0|Even if you are a casual fan of RPGs, you will have a ton of fun with P4G. The characters and story are some of the best you will find in videogames. The combat is top notch and exciting as well. The battles are fast and challenging enough without being unfair/cheap. All of this comes together great on the PS Vita with some very cool online helping mechanics and beautiful graphics and music.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is not a book for everyone, because it is a sad book in many ways (I mean, the main characters have cancer). But I wish everyone would give it a try, it is sweet and sad, and maybe not totally believable, but it is also that kind of book that touches your soul.

0071762345|5.0|Likeable Social Media is one of the best business-genre books I have read. I was engaged and inspired and couldn't put it down. It is the most comprehensive, current guide I have found on how to leverage social media for all types of business. The case studies are relevant and the step-by-step information is presented in such a way that the principles taught will remain pertinent for a long time, despite the quickly-evolving digital and social media world. I'm keeping it to reread and use as a reference. I loved it.
B004EBT5CU|2.0|I have to agree with many of the reviewers who give this CD low marks for production quality. The CD sounds OK on your average car stereo, but play it on decent equipment at good volume, and it's pretty awful. My equipment is by no means sub-par; in fact, it actually makes many mediocre disks sound pretty fantastic. I enjoy listening to female artists similar to Adele, like Alanis, Macy Gray, Indigo Girls, even Kate Bush, and they all sound excellent. This is the ONLY one I've ever been so disappointed with. The bass is especially bad, sounding very boomy and almost like it's out of phase. Of course, if you check out the Wikipedia article on this CD, you'll see that it really went through production hell, so that might explain the very uneven quality.<br /><br />I have the vanilla USA no-frills version of the CD; I'm going to buy another copy, maybe one of the foreign releases with the bonus tracks, and see if it's any better. Because there's no doubt that Adele herself is quite awesome! Meanwhile, don't get mad at the reviewers who dis this disc based on the sound quality; they're telling the truth. For one of the best-selling albums of all time, the listening public deserves better treatment and so does Adele.

B006GWO5NE|5.0|I am on a fixed budget, being on SSDI.  And a single mom.  So paying almost ten dollars for a cable that I can get a non-Amazon brand for half that price?  I was hesitant.  Very hesitant.<br /><br />But it was worth it.  I had been using a USB cable, but my Kindle Fire (not HD, the older model) was suddenly charging slower.  Much slower.  In fact, it would no longer charge while I was using it if it was plugged in.  Or it was, but the battery percentage was still decreasing.  So I decided to completely wear the battery down as far as it would go, and recharge it to full, figuring it just needed a little maintenance.  Typically, doing that, it would take about 3-4 hours to recharge to full.  But it took over 12 hours.  So I decided to hope that it was the cable, and not the kindle itself.<br /><br />I got the new Kindle USB cable yesterday.  I completely ran down the battery again, and it charged in 3 1/2 hours.  With me reading a book on it while it was doing it.  Yeah!!!  So yes, paying extra for a Kindle specific Amazon branded cable is worth it, in my opinion.

0062014536|3.0|Like many other reviewers, I didn't like the way it \\"ended\\". I say \\"ended\\" in quotations marks because it didn't really end at all. It was one of those endings marked by a new beginning. Walls come down, new era begins, individual stories are swallowed in the triumph of a larger whole, which I guess is beautiful in its own right... Just didn't really go the direction I was expecting.<br /><br />The whole thing started out as this focus on love and being free to love and to feel, but somehow it morphed into a fight for the freedom to choose and to follow one's own path. It became less about the Deliria and more about fighting for your right to make your own decisions, to choose a different path from the one that is chosen for you. I get that it's a wider message with greater implications, but the beauty was initially in the love stories: in Alex teaching Lena what love is, and then her passing that lesson on to Julian even as she herself was still learning and coming to grips with the complexities of it. In Delirium, you see Lena and Alex building themselves into each other as he, drawing on his experience of freedom from growing up in the wilds, opens her up to possibilities and feelings she thought were bad, and then just as she spreads her wings to take flight with him, bam, he's gone and she doesn't know what to do, think, feel.<br /><br />Then in Pandemonium, Julian comes along and we see Lena wrestling with this new freedom to love and developing feelings for Julian in spite of her love for Alex. We watch as a new love is built on the fibers or a shared struggle and whispered secrets that reveal how much alike she and Julian are. She lost her first love, finally lets herself fall again, refusing to let a second love slip away, and then Alex returns, angry, understandably heartbroken at seeing his love obviously attached to someone else.<br /><br />But Requiem just doesn't fit. It's all about fighting for survival and overcoming tyranny and \\"tearing down the walls\\", but there was really no love in it. I guess the original fight for love is revealed as a small part of a larger fight for freedom of choice... But it just left so much unresolved!<br /><br />This series was like a funnel. It started out very focused on a romance between two specific people, then slowly expanded outward to highlight the importance of fighting for freedom of choice, something that encompasses the freedom to love and to connect and to bridge gaps. This is all well and good, but I want to know what happens to Alex, Lena, Julian, Tack (did he know Raven was pregnant?), Annabel, and Coral!<br /><br />Lauren Oliver, please give an \\"After the Walls are Down\\" story!ls\\", but there was really no love in it.

B00A1AF4DM|4.0|To be honest, I wasn't expecting too much from this novel after the poor reviews and the fact that it was completed after Crichton's passing. While this is far from ranking up with his best work, it IS quite enjoyable if you can suspend disbelief enough to lose yourself in the story. The idea of shrinking humans down to about an inch is ludicrous and that's one area where this book doesn't feel like classic Crichton. The science isn't as detailed or believable as it was in Timeline or Jurassic Park, making this one feel more rushed and less focused. While the science in those previous books wasn't exactly realistic, Michael had a way of crafting it in such a way that you believed it just might be possible. Unfortunately the Tensor Core in Micro lacks that background, causing the novel to feel less threatening.<br /><br />However, once you get past the wonky science the rest of the story unveils itself more naturally. The descriptions and encounters of the micro world are fascinating and it makes you think about what it would be like to be no bigger than a small bug. This makes the battles with birds, snakes, spiders, insects, and regular-sized humans tense and it's here where Crichton's research pulls you into the story. His bibliography at the end is detailed and clearly a lot of emphasis was placed on describing these creatures as accurately as possible. The characters are pretty one-dimensional, although I have to admit I was surprised by some of the deaths and injuries sustained throughout the narrative. There were several curveballs that I didn't see coming and I'd recommend avoiding as many spoilers as possible.<br /><br />It's hard to know how much Richard Preston wrote and what was finished at the time of Crichton's death. Micro isn't on the same level as masterpieces like Sphere, Jurassic Park, or The Andromeda Strain and it would be foolish to assume that an unfinished story will compare to the great works that came before. If you take it for what it is then you might just be surprised. It's sad that we'll have no further works from this great author but it was nice to enter his world one last time.en you might just be surprised.

B00BEZTMQ8|3.0|I will begin by saying that the Hobbit is one of my favorite stories (I try to read it once a year) and was ecstatic when Peter Jackson decided to make it into film.  Of course, with LoTR already on film, how could he not?  That said, I agree completely with some of the other reviewers that it would be prudent to wait for the extended version when it comes out for Christmas.  Don't get me wrong, as a special features addict, I was sorely tempted to buy this one anyway.  However, since [...] (and I'm sure other sites as well) has most of the video blogs posted on The Hobbit pages and some other sites somewhere probably have the other special features, I'm willing to wait for the better version. Especially if I'm also looking forward to the 2nd installment of The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug...can't wait!!

B007U8U1V8|4.0|I got this as a gift for a family member, but since it's an mp3 download, I gave it a listen first.  I have to admit, I am surprised at how much I enjoyed this album.  I dabbled in White Stripes back when they first hit it big, but never followed through with them or Jack White's career afterwards.  This is a strong album, both wistful and agonizing while always melodic.  There's a lot of talent at work here, and it shines through in how good it sounds.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|I stumbled across this documentary on netflix, and watched it only because of the title. At the time I was completely and blissfully ignorant about the food that we consume. This documentary changed everything. Its interesting and horrifying. It has led me down an investigative path that I cannot get off of. Im now shopping locally, searching out organic farmers, Im researching Monsanto and I am paying more attention to the ethical treatment of animals. I have to say, especially to someone like me in a very small town who does not have access to a large supply of organic foods, this subject matter can be very depressing. It seems as though people are shocked and then move on and forget about being angry. It leaves you feeling like you need to do something, but you cant really do enough all at the same time. It will force you to educate yourself, and there needs to be more of that.

B007REV4YI|4.0|The story and its execution have that well known bond feel. Because of this the good guys and bad guys are predictable. That is why we still watch 007 after 50 years. I would watch another 50 years if I would live so long.<br /><br />I did find it refreshing that with the exception of a few loyal gimmicks that they went back to traditional vehicle chases and recognizable hand weapons.<br /><br />No intention of giving the plot away but it seems that someone has pilfered the list of agents and is intending to dispatch them in a frugal manner.  It is probably M's fault as she is getting old and still insists that there are bad guys lurking around the corner. She is just the type of person to get Bond shot.<br /><br />Oh yes there is a shower scene.
0062238868|4.0|As I mentioned in another review, this book is one a series of contemporary works written by men who have served as Navy SEALs in the recent wars on terror that remain related in one way or another.  I suspect because of both time line and the very small numbers of qualified me to take up arms in this capacity.<br /><br />This is a very interesting book. While it does not specifically speak to what it takes to become a SEAL Sniper or the skills required it does make it clear that service and sacrifice are no small part of the overall package required.  In this respect Chris Kyle will always remain a legend in the American military for his professionalism and skill.<br /><br />Brandon Webb's book, My Life in the Red Circle, is technically different as it clearly describes in depth the types of skills required of a skilled sniper.  The two books make excellent companions to each other as does both of Marcus Luttrell's outstanding books.  That being said, Kyle's writing style and his editing while good made for a rather colorful, sometimes a rather salty and rustic book<br /><br />One of the more interesting aspects of this book is the method described by Kyle for insertion into enemy held territory as an advanced element of a larger assault. The result was his team became a force multiplier by providing both intelligence and by directing resources to kill as many insurgents as possible.<br /><br />This book is a rather gut wrenching look at one man's perspective at war.  In particular, the story of Ryan Job comes to mind, as a story of both inspiration and sadness.  But you'll have to read the book to get the full details of this story.<br /><br />I enjoyed reading this book and would strongly recommend reading Webb's previously mentioned book as well as both of the excellent books by Marcus Luttrell.
B00BMUYLSE|3.0|Just having David Bowie come back with ANY album is something most of us fans can appreciate.  Do not hesitate to buy it.  But overall these tracks aren't strong.  I've listened to the whole album 5 times over and nothing really stands out.  It makes for good road music, meaning just the music in the background while driving.  \\"Dirty Boys\\"(track 2) sounds like an attempt to mix \\"Sister Midnight/Red Money\\" with \\"Fame\\".  \\"The Stars(are out tonight) is the best song.  This album definately follows 2002's \\"Heathen\\" and 2003's \\"Reality\\".  Very much closer to \\"Heathen\\", in more mature manor or finely-aged if you will, but lacking the dynamics and angst \\"Heathen\\" represented.  Most of the songs here are very stripped down with little synth or keyboards(where is Mike Garson???).  This album is good, production is smooth, and all the songs are well crafted.  But it is at the very bottom of all of Bowie's collective works from the 1990's and 2000's.

I loved and I hope you do too!  After reading Catch 22 I decided to watch the movie but despite the star studded cast I could not get past the first 20 minutes (Alan Arkin,  Martin Balsam, Art Garfunkel, Bob Newhart, Anthony Perkins, Martin Sheen, Jon Voight, Orsion Wells - I'll stop here; it would be easier to list who wasn't in the movie). Enjoy!<br /><br />Amazon streaming which is a product i love.  I don't watch much television but with Amazon streaming and several others I subscribe to I have access to the largest assortment of American and foreign television and movie programming.  I never watch cable except to catch the news.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|Love watching this with my thirteen year old daughter, and the feeling is mutual. How could I not give it five stars for that alone?
0440242401|2.0|I have read so many other Sophie Kinsella books and this is the first one I have not liked. It is just slow and drab.
159668139X|5.0|It arrived safely. But I moved and misplaced my loom and book. I hope to find it soon.<br />Amazon had a good selection of books to chose from.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|For someone to like this book, you have to be human. To be willing to reach out, take a risk and grab life while you have it is a side effect of its reading.<br /><br />To be human is to accept the faults you cannot change, and live with the best intentions.<br /><br />I loved this story for its gentle way of teaching. You will learn a bit about yourself when contemplating the meaning of what it is to be &#34;okay.&#34;
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|It's awesome I like it because I go to school and something is always there but sometimes it doesn't load but it's still worth getting
B0084IG8TM|3.0|The movie is very different from what I pictured it would be from reading the books.  The movie left a lot of the detail parts out which contributed to the story.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|love the game.wholesome fun.I was only disappointed in app freezes and lagging. would also like to be able to personalize paddock area.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|Rule Number 1: Never Kill Anyone You Know. Rule Number 2: Never Kill the Innocent. Rule Number 3: A True Assassin Might Not Play by the Rules.<br /><br />David Baldacci introduces us to Will Robie in The Innocent. Robie works for the US Government, but in a department that the US Government would deny any knowledge of...that being the Department of Sanctioned Assassinations. And don't worry...no spoilers here...all this is evident in the first few pages of the book.<br /><br />It's all a day in the life of an assassin for the first few chapters, but when Robie is faced with a \\"difficult\\" assignment, he finds that the simple-life of a super secret assassin can become more than just complicated. Suddenly the tables are turned and it seems that someone wants Robie to join his past targets in the afterworld. And making matters worse--as the cover of the book suggests--Robie has some unexpected, young company in his new endeavor as a government agent with an apparent price on his head.<br /><br />The Innocent was an awesome page-turner just like Baldacci's John Puller novel [[ASIN:1455523151 The Forgotten]]. And just like The Forgotten, The Innocent has its share of implausible scenarios...in this case especially during the last 50 pages. Adding to the unrealistic is what too many authors seem to do all too much: They make a teenager have greater wit and wisdom than the smartest, most charismatic person you know. However, The Innocent was extremely well written and super entertaining. If you like a good thriller, click the Add to Cart button...you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />And, hey, the good news is that if you like The Innocent as much as I did you won't have to wait long for the next Robie story....Robie is back in Baldacci's [[ASIN:1455521213 The Hit]] at the end of April 2013.
B00846F1YW|5.0|A game that had my undivided attention from the start to the finish! Highly recommend for anyone who enjoys puzzles and exercising their memorization skills!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Fast service great price. Disk number one had two scratches that caused a pause in movie four times. To me no big deal. The rest of disc were great. Loved the movie.  I have read all the books so far so this leaves off at an interesting time and feel season three will be on Tv soon. Omg so much more to come. Stay tune.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|That's truely all I can say this book is amazing.I read all the time and its very seldom you find character who will live in your heart forever and for me that's Christian and Anastasia.at first I was scared to read this book because it's the in thing to do right now that never interested me.I thought it would be just soft porn.I read books like that before didn't care for them.but  I was so wrong this novel is so much more then kinky sex it's about real people about what we all secertly need even though we won't admit it ourselves and finding that soul mate that can get uss there.thank you so much for these books I will Cherish them always I'm looking forward to where this author goes next.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Need more games that are at least as involved as this one.  Many other games in this category have been boring in comparison.
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|This game was awesome for about the first 20 minutes, then got old. Screen controls are difficult for some reason on the Tablet S...I wish it supported a game controller. Game is kinda creepy which I do like.
B005FITIK0|4.0|Young Adult starring Charlize Theron is not one of those fluffy romantic comedies as it was portrayed to be. This film written by Diablo Cody and directed Jason Reitman (the winning duo behind Juno) is about a divorced woman who writes young adult fiction novels, and pretty much has a \\"breakdown\\" when she goes back home to try to win back her ex-boyfriend who's now married. Theron nails her role as Mavis, I don't think any other actress could have pulled it off but her. Mavis is a very delusional, depressed woman who drinks way too much, pulls out her own hair, and her life as a writer is coming to an abrupt halt. The thing that was the most frustrating and yet real about Mavis is she really makes no attempts to change her self-destructive behavior. Mavis will do anything to get what she wants, and along the way her friends and family start to notice she's falling apart in more ways than one. This movie doesn't have a clear-cut ending which makes Young Adult seem believable, but this movie is not for everyone. It's not a very happy film, there's a lot of unanswered questions and Mavis is not a likable character so it does make it nearly impossible to root for her. But in the end you can't help feeling sorry for her because she's human, and sometimes being human is painful enough.
B008HJGPVO|4.0|I like it overall, but it does feel like it would break easily.  For the price though, it's pretty good.  No problems so far though!
1451696191|5.0|I don't know where to begin. For one, I know I am way behind in finally reading this book. Second, despite not being  a teenage anymore I can still feel the issues of growing up. I don't think it is something that ever leaves you. The years of middle school and high school contain so many feelings, thoughts, and moments of life that even when you grow up and move on beyond the idiosyncrasies of this stage of life you can always sit and feel and remember those years.<br /><br />Reading this book put me back into that place. There are simply way too many quotes and passages from the book for me to even begin to cite a few here in this review. My copy is going to be marked, highlighted and scribbled in more than any other fiction book I have read.<br /><br />I hate to compare this book to other books because one comparing does not do justice to the parties being compared(as discussed in the book), but I cannot help but think of Catcher in the Rye. I know this has been shared, discussed, and argued all over the web, but I have to compare. I read Catcher in the Rye every year. It is a must re-read for me. It connected with me in high school unlike any other book I read during that stage in my life. I am sure this book does the same with anyone reading it during their teen years. In many ways it is like the quote from the book(I had to give one!)<br /><br />\\"And I thought about how many people have loved those songs. And how many people got through a lot of bad times because of those songs. And how many people enjoyed good times with those songs. And how much those songs really mean. I think it would be great to have written one of those songs. I bet if I wrote one of them, I would be very proud. I hope the people who wrote those songs are happy. I hope they feel it's enough. I really do because they've made me happy. And I'm only one person.\\"<br /><br />Whether it is music or books everyone has a connection to the movement and mood of the elements. We all take away certain aspects and make it our own. It almost feels like we are the only one who has these connections, but really there are many. The power of words allows us to feel that things are specifically for us.<br /><br />This will to my all time favorite read lists. I need to read again along with some of my other books like Catcher and begin to compare and process. This is not a one time read book. I think it is one that you have to read again and see what you missed.<br /><br />If you are like me and you have not read this book, then don't wait any longer. Don't miss out on this novel. I am glad I read it. I wish I did not wait so long, but there is always a reason for the way things work out. Go live your life!in aspects and make it our own.

B006RXQ1L6|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! I am just starting to build my blue ray collection and this is the perfect start for it!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is one of the best books i have read in a long time. This book was so inspirational and it made me feel that just because i am \\"special\\" doesn't mean i am weird. I related to Patrick AND Charlie in so many ways and i really felt like my life was being told through the novel. I recommend this novel to anybody who feels different and misplaced in the world. Even though it is a young adult book, i believe that any mature child even can be interested and thoroughly enjoy it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Can not stop playing. I love this game and can't wait to see what the next level brings. I highly  recommend this game.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|When I heard they were making the Hobbit in 3 parts, I said: \\"Oh great, they're just going to milk it to death aren't they?\\"<br /><br />To quote Thorin, I've never been so wrong in all my life. This isn't just a simple milking of a series for every last dime they can squeeze out of it, this is an amazingly well fleshed out spectacle of pure awesome. It reminded me of Indiana Jones and all of the best parts of the LOTRs trilogy combined. Five stars!
B003YHSE7W|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my husband with his new blue ray player, he absolutely loves watching it on blue ray rather than dvd. It is totally different he says!
B005D9MUWY|4.0|When I first got my samsung, android already featured auto correct & the original keyboard wasn't that bad but ever since the update it became trash. So I got SwiftKey, and not one bit disappointed..
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I read and listened to this book at the same time.  It is great to be able to do that with audible and kindle.  I could hear the book with a German accent at the same time I read it with my own mind and language.  For all my students, this is what I was trying to give you, while you gave it back to me in so many delicious sounds and ways of saying love aloud.  For isn't that what we shared on the roads to understanding what we meant to say when we spoke that halting English through so many filters and accents and experiences of each other?
B005LAIIGC|5.0|I really love this movie, and I was glad to order it. It's really underestimated and though its appearance is that for a younger viewer audience it is still enjoyable for those of an older audience such as myself of 18. I recommend it to all ages and the books series as well! It's easter themed in time for easter coming up, so I liked the bonus of the two eggs. I recommend it!
B0052HWYS2|5.0|Very interesting depiction of Macbeth but there was too much nudity. My son was supposed to watch it for school and I watched it with him I found it a little too adult for him at least while I was sitting there with him. I did complain. But for adults this is a decent presentation.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|U really get a good feel of all the characters being portrayed..i couldn't put it down...very well written and an awesome story...
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a book that will absorb you. You will read into the night, you will be on the edge of your seat.<br />It's just a very interesting story about a very interesting boy, no matter how old you are, this is a fascinating piece of fiction.

1400069807|5.0|I am the type of person who hates highlighting in books. Even in college, it pained me to take a highlighter and mark up a page, no matter how brilliant the passage. It was a sort of sacrilege, a desecration of the book. So for me to mark up passage after passage of this book (albeit the Kindle version, but still), that has to say something about how shocking I found much of what this book has to say. It always strikes me as sort of pretentious and presumptuous to call a book \\"important\\", but this is an important book. It's a stellar example of the true power of excellent investigative journalism, and is great evidence for the argument that we need to be willing to pay for journalism if we want quality and depth.<br /><br />I think it is fair to criticize this book a bit by saying there are some sections that feel a little hasty. There's a bit of sloppiness here and there, and the book is repetitive at times. Still, this didn't detract from the importance of its message.<br /><br />Divided into three sections: salt, sugar, and fat, Moss goes into great detail in analyzing why the processed food industry is so reliant on these three ingredients, even when it knows that these ingredients aren't good for us and may well be contributing to obesity and other diseases, such as diabetes. The bottom line is this book exposes the ugly side of capitalism: when you are so intent on selling a product and providing a high profit margin for the pleasure of Wall Street and your investors, you tend to lose sight of the fact that the product you're producing is meant to nourish people. I felt almost like I was looking at this book from opposite sides of the looking glass. On one hand, I could understand the industry drive to increase profits and lower costs, and to not only meet but beat the competition. From the other side, this is food we're talking about here, food that has become a huge part of the American diet and that may well be killing us. Are profits worth this? If ever there was a reason for government regulation, it is the food industry--this book proves exactly why that intervention is sometimes necessary. The market isn't self-regulating when all that matters is profit, not what the product is doing to the people who are using it.<br /><br />Parts of this book are downright revolting, such as when Moss has the opportunity to taste some products without the added salts, sugars, and fats on which they reply. He describes things like Cheez-Its and canned soup as tasting bitter and metallic, and this was enough to put me off those products for good. Moss argues that the food industry uses inferior ingredients not because those ingredients are acceptable, but because they generate more profit and cost the company less. The ingredients are the very definition of inferior precisely because they taste terrible. In order to mask the horrible taste, the industry, you guessed it, loads the products up with salt, sugar, and fat. Time after time, I couldn't help but wonder why we eat these things when they sound like the sort of nourishment we wouldn't give to our dogs.<br /><br />Ah, but there's an answer for that. It's not enough for food companies to sell us a product, they must hook us on it and instill a sense of brand loyalty. It should go without saying that we can only eat so much food, which means there are only so many food dollars to be won. In a perfect world, we'd eat just enough to sustain us and keep us healthy but, in that world, the food companies wouldn't make the obscene profits they make. So, what they do is scientifically formulate their foods to make them so addictive we eat more than we should--and they do this not only knowingly, but on purpose. Let that sink in for a while: food companies are actively trying to ensure that Americans overeat because the more we eat, the more money they make. They invest a lot of time, effort, and research into figuring out what makes us like the taste of something and using that information to create recipes that we literally find irresistible. It's mind boggling to imagine what we could create if that sort of devotion, time, and money was applied not to making us eat food that wrecks havoc on our health but, say, to something like figuring out a cheap way to provide clean water for all, or to find a cure for cancer.<br /><br />This is one of the most striking elements of the book, the way it exposes how science can be monstrously twisted into a discipline that's used not for good (developing medicines, explaining how the world works), but for bad (tricking us into eating unhealthy quantities of processed foods). It's important for savvy consumers to know that studies and experiments can be structured in such a way as to try to determine their outcome before they even begin, and food companies are notorious for doing just this--sometimes because they've taken a page from the tobacco industry, which has owned some of the largest food companies. Whenever there's an outcry over a particular public health concern, the food companies fund studies that either try to downplay the risks or that help them continue to pump us full of terrible food by swapping out one risk for another. One need look no further than the high sugar content of the foods that were churned out during the fat free craze. The food companies prayed on consumer fears by creating a product that helped us assuage our worries about fat by getting us hooked on sugar.<br /><br />Most pernicious of all, though, is how the food industry has turned to preying on the most vulnerable in our society--children, lower income families, and people in developing nations--in order to continue to pad their profits. Through clever marketing and a concerted effort to ensure that prime shelf space is given to nutrient-deficient, calorically dense foods, the food industry ensures that those most in need of good nutrition are the least likely to get it. What's perhaps even more disturbing is how they've convinced the public that any attempts to level the playing field and make healthier foods more readily available is a violation of our \\"choice\\"--as if any of us would choose to be slowly poisoned by what we eat. One need look no further than New York's attempts at banning supersize sugary beverages. Yes, perhaps people should have the choice to ingest as much sugary soda as they want, but at what cost? At what point do we understand that we're being deprived of our choice to live a health lifestyle and to protect our children from the predatory marketing in which companies engage to make sure they make our children customers for life? And what about the costs to public health, don't they count for something?<br /><br />This book was such a wake up call. I'd already begun to look at processed foods with a dubious eye and have worked hard to eliminate them from my home and to prepare fresh meals from scratch using more fruits and vegetables, but this book finally helped tip the scale--pun intended--and made me determined to avoid added sugars wherever possible. I was so disgusting and upset by what I read that I found myself frantically cleaning out both my fridge and my pantry, throwing away things like salad dressing and mayonnaise because they both had added sugars. Why do we need sugar in mayonnaise anyway? That, I think, is the sort of question all Americans need to ask themselves. Maybe then we can end up with some semblance of sanity in our food policies.
B00846REIS|1.0|You know when someone has a REALLY bad habit and after a while that's ALL you notice?  Well, that's what this book did for me.  If Gideon said Eva's name one time he said it a MILLION times.  I was beginning to wonder the author's reasoning for making such a simple minded stalker like character.  But then she'd have the most ridiculous descriptions of the simplest events that I wondered if Webster's dictionary was paying her extra to use a certain number of uncommonly used words to describe the exact same thing over and over.  This book was probably only about 97 pages long but with the re-edited and re-described scenes she was able to drag it out to a miserable 372 pages. But I'm no quitter and I suffered through it with so much eye rolling my contacts strained under the constant movement.<br /><br />Don't, I beg of you, waste your valuable time and money on this absolutely ridiculous book.  Fifty Shades author is probably already talking to their attorney about stolen copy rights.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Superbly written, keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat. Evokes real emotions for the main characters. I will be looking for more from this author.

B00B23O96A|2.0|Well I always thought that Eric Clapton lived in England and was hoping his solid rock/blues background and influence from other British Rockers would shine through on this album.  Mr Clapton must have moved to the islands.  Many of the tunes have a very reggae sound and others are remakes from the Big Band Era.  First Stewart, then McCartney and now Clapton.  All got old right before my eyes!  All just gave up on the type of music that made them famous.  Time to hang up the guitar E.C and most of all, quit singing.  His voice never was his strong point, but this CD doesn't spotlight his guitar talents either.  Retire in comfort, spend the money you earned when you were on top and enjoy the rest of your life.  Listening to this CD was pretty painful, with the exception of Angel.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|The graphics on this game are really amazing. I love that about it. The only down side is that the game seems to have been created by folks who know graphics but not much about the horse world. That's been improving though. Now, you can actually choose English jumping saddles when you're jumping. I'm hoping they'll eventually add more games and activities to play.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|Five Stars!! I've read a lot of books on WWII and I would rate this as one of the best. Fantastic! Recommend to anyone looking for some good in human nature during a horrific time.

B004EPYZQM|5.0|THIS FIFTH INSTALLMENT OF THE ENTERTAINING ACTION-PACKED \\" FAST AND THE FURIOUS \\" FRANCHISE, I STRONGLY FEEL IS THE BEST ONE TO THE SERIES. I LOVED THE OTHER ONES. I DIDN'T REALLY CARE FOR THE THIRD ONE AS MUCH AS THE OTHERS. DUE TO THEM CUTTING OUT THE BRIAN O' CONNOR CHARACTER, AND ADDING A NEW MAIN CHARACTER, WHO WASN'T EVEN IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. I FEEL WHEN THEY CUT OUT A MAIN CHARACTER, IT DECIMATES THE FEEL,YOU GOT WITH ITS PREDECESSORS. IT JUST DIDN'T FEEL THE SAME AS THE FIRST TWO AND THE ONES THAT WERE FILMED AFTER THAT. I ALMOST GAVE UP ON THE FRANCHISE AT THAT JUNCTURE OF THE INSTALLMENTS. BUT, WHEN THEY BROUGHT HIM AND THE ORIGINAL CHARACTERS BACK TO THE FOURTH CHAPTER, MY INTEREST IN THE SERIES RETURNED, LIKE IT NEVER LEFT. THEN, IN THE FIFTH, I BECAME A BIGGER FAN, EVEN MORE THAN BEFORE. I SAW THE FOURTH AND FIFTH ONES IN THEATERS, AND REALLY ENJOYED THEM. I FEEL THE MAJORITY OF THE INSTALLMENTS WERE REALLY ENTERTAINING AND ACTION-PACKED, BUT THIS ONE TOPS THEM ALL. IF YOU LIKED THE ACTION AND STORY OF THE FAMOUS FRANCHISE, I THINK YOU'LL ENJOY THIS ONE EVEN MORE. WHEN I SAW THIS ONE IN THEATERS, I ENJOYED IT, AND COULDN'T WAIT UNTIL IT WAS RELEASED ON DVD AND BLU-RAY, OF COURSE, I BOUGHT THE BLU-RAY COPY. LIKE QUOTED BY THE DIRECTOR, IT HAD THREE TIMES THE ACTION AS THE OTHER ONES, I TOTALLY AGREE. PLUS, THE STORY LINE, EXCELLENT!  I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS ONE TO ANYONE.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|This is a great, quick read. It's a compelling and dark story about an abusive relationship. But also, it is about healing and facing your fears. The characters kept me engaged, but the story is quite violent at times. I recommend you only read it if you have a tolerance for that kind of thing. (It's not as violent as say American Psycho... but it definitely made me cringe, sort of like a really violent episode of Law and Order SVU...) If you like crime novels then check this one out.
B002RI9UBS|5.0|Amazing story about courage and will. It will make u laugh and cry all at the same time. Really want to meet and shake hands wit Pi Patel!!!
B00846F1YW|3.0|Using Kindle Fire, the game counts each touch as an error even tho you may only be pinching or enlarging picture. I got this as FAOTD, so the price was right. Wouldn't pay $3. Very nice graphics.

B00AP9RQE4|4.0|I enjoyed this book as part of the Vorkosigan Saga. I probably read this book out of sequence, but as it was mainly about Captain Vorpatril and not about Miles or Mark, it did not detract from the story.<br />I like Lois McMaster Bujold's science fiction because she keeps her imagination under a tight and consistant control. Although some of her inventions are beyond present physics and engineering, they have a plausible progression.

B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Was ok I guess haven't really noticed.  I really don't have anything more to add. I think your required amount of words are really not interested
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Harry Hole is the perfect combination of flawed, relentless and heroic.  Love this writers style. Have read others by Nesbo.
B0041D843M|5.0|This book is a must read for every adult, specifically Americans since we are the nation most suffering from diseases of affluence (eating too much of a rich, animal-based diet). This book is an incredibly informative work based on a compilation of in depth studies and personal experience, but isn't so thick with science that the average person must struggle to comprehend the facts. I 100% recommend this to everyone as a means of saving our health from ourselves.
B0051HNMTI|5.0|You will feel it, I thought I was in OK shape, could not finish the 5 min set. Will keep trying...
B00005S6K8|5.0|I liked this remake alot like the original,  It has a fresh take on it without being to overbearing.  Just the right kind of stuff.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|Filled with quirky, intriguing sounds and lyrics, almost every track will reel you in and take you for a very enjoyable sonic ride.  Even more awesome, there's more to discover each time you listen.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|It was entertaining and well written. I enjoyed the storyline. I look forward to the next book in the series.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|graphics and sound were nice. this is the first g5 game I haven't bought and played all the way through. the directional arrows/turns etc were juvenile handling at best which made it hard and frustrating to play. the hidden objects were hard to find even using the zoom.
B00B3HJLX6|5.0|Man did Adrenaline Mob knock this one out of the park. Truly a great collection of songs with heavy dose of smoke, fire and brimstone added to the mix for great measure.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love this book more than any other Book I have read . I give it five stars I L O V E it
0765325950|5.0|This novel was a fantastic read.  It had a very satisfying ending.  Brandon & Robert did a good job at wrapping up all the numerous characters in the series in this final book.<br /><br />As my friend said, the book is bitter sweet.  It was a wonderful book but now the WoT world / series is over.  I think we all want it to continue forever!<br /><br />I think the \\"1\\" ratings are just the sourpusses that realize it is over.  Yes, I am sure we all could find a character or two that could have been added to the final novel or expected an additional chapter or two at the end to talk about all the \\"what will be\\"; but what would all the WoT blog sites do if the book wrapped it all up so neatly for us.<br /><br />The world was blessed to have Robert Jordon.  He brought us a fantastic series that will live on for future generations to read and enjoy.  Brandon really stepped up to give us a seamless end to the series.  Thanks Brandon!  You were a good author prior to these last three WoT book but now that you have a deep understanding of Jordon's style of writing; you could be an unstoppable force in Epic Fantasy in the decades ahead.  I look forward to following you. May the Light shine on you...<br /><br />Dear Harriet, please let Brandon write a few more WoT adventures.  Rand in the outrigger novels exploring the rest of the world?  Dropping in scenes with other beloved WoT characters just to delight the readers.  Hopefully Robert has a few notes laying around on that topic.....
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Saves time thumbing through the pages and turning back and fourth between refrences.  It is so hard to hold a bible on your lap while holding a tablet and pencil.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|A gripping tale which haunts. An intricate tale which consumes you. I need it to end so I can function again in life!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I like the game. I don't have a horse but I love this game. I'm allergic to most animals so I have virtual pets.
B004XJRQUQ|2.0|The 1st book was decent, but it got way worse from there. Catching Fire did not make sense, and Mockingjay was absolutely horrible<br />I hate the violent parts, and the theme/plot was annoying, but Collins did a good job.
B0013TXA5Y|4.0|Overall was a solid book and story pace was very good. Characters were interesting and wanted to learn more about them.<br /><br />The story was a bit predictable as far as the twists concerned but didn't detract from enjoying the story.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Good story for all ages. My teenage sons both recommend it. Might be a little edgy for tweens and below.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|In lieu of Chris Kyle's recent death, the passages in this book can be haunting.  This book gives a lot of perspective into what it takes to become, and remain, a Navy Seal. These guys should be held in the highest esteem by our society.
B0021L8V0M|5.0|What can I say about Angelina Jolie.  She is one of the most sexiest women out there in the movie world.  And in this movie, she is not only sexy but she is kick ass in her action scences.  It is a must see movie if you like action and Angelina !!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I am obsessed with the show and wanted more... But this is totally different, like an alternate world! Sweet :)
B0049P1VHS|5.0|I am totally &#34;Hooked&#34; on this series. I have already seen it and am current with the episodes but wanted to own it for myself. Thank you.
B004R1Q296|5.0|I read this a very long time ago but lost the book in a move.  I have it on my Kindle & will never lose it.  Everyone should read this and get a better understanding of the past to better understand the future.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|If you like blood and gore, this movie is diffinitely for you.  It have all that and then some.  It will keep you on the edge of your seat.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I love the way it learns to predict what you'll write. I just got the notification that this feature has saved me over 5000 keystrokes!
B0050DZ8J0|5.0|I am new to LinkedIn for about a month now. I find this LinkedIn app extremely useful and user friendly.
B0064TVQ5E|2.0|I can not read Chinese, I thought that this would be similar to the Microsoft Mahjong Titans, but it wasn't even close
B000N2HBSO|5.0|If you want a biography of several men, primarily of Lincoln, that interests you and never bores you, this is it. You read this book and know why Lincoln was so loved. He surrounded himself with men who'd initially hated him but grew to not only love him (for the most part) but to perform a great service for their country.<br /><br />Read this and &#34;Battle Cry of (for?) Freedom&#34;.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I'm still getting used to the different version but I love that I can access my boards any time I want.
B0036SSZIC|5.0|This movie is more relevant today than when it was made.  This was very educational.  Sadly, Michael Moore is right.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Addictively entertaining! The whole family enjoys it,  and I've noticed an increase in hand and eye coordination skills in my toddlers. Other than the fact that ultimately you're running from the police...lol..it's good clean fun.
B002VECM4A|4.0|My wife and I loved this. Some scenes were sad and hilarious at the same time. Horrifying details of a prison-like life but draws you in.
1401234550|5.0|Geoff Johns is a serious contender for best comic author in the industry right now. He's completely overhauled the series for the better, and made one of comic history's most complex villains all the more intricate with his convolutions of good and bad, of control and freedom. This collection just serves as a reminder that to access the best that the superhero genre has to offer, from story to Doug Mahnke's beautiful renditions of the characters, one need look no further than Johns' Green Lantern mythos. Absolutely wonderful.
B00BFUUMO8|2.0|cannot connect to facebook.  Get a msg that says misconfigured for facebook.  Support sent me an email that it is a problem between facebook an kindle fire.  So fix it then.  Its your app.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|First of all, the production values of Game of Thrones are amazing.  Each episode is filmed like a movie (sound, cinematography, special effect, etc), and the Blu-Ray format sure gives it more justice than just watching it on HBO.<br /><br />Many have said its not as good as season 1, but I disagree.  I don't want to give out any spoilers, but I will say that compared to season 1, It is maybe not as climactic, but season 2 does move the story forward, and fleshes out (literally and figuratively) the characters more.<br /><br />I have yet to delve into the extras on the boxed set, but if it is similar to the Season 1 Blu Ray set, then I have no doubt that I will be satisfied... more backstory to Westeros, their people, cultures, etc.
B006CUDDUG|5.0|A quick read, simple and complex at the same time, with characters that---how do those cliched reviews go?---&#34;pop off the page&#34;. Perfection.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|great fun for. an old lady!<br />like the hidden objects puzzles are pretty easy but fun.<br />however thought the whole game was free will not purchase the compplete game<br /><br />willnotpurchase the whole game thought it was free not a trial
B00AFEY354|5.0|This movie was very captivating beginning to end. A dark story but an original plot of the typical wallflower kid struggling through high school definitely one of my favorites.
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|Game rocks for a car game! You'd think this game would be all about cars but it's all about cute cast of cartoon fun! I like you can slow down the tilt so it's not just crash after crash..
B0068FYZIO|4.0|Which is to say, Spielberg's great but there are moments when he just needs to dial it back:<br /><br />Spielberg: &#34;Hmn, this movie isn't moving enough. Hey, Liam, you think you can work up a few tears?&#34;<br /><br />Neeson: &#34;Hey, I'll do anything if it gets me nominated for an Academy Award.&#34;<br /><br />(That is, Schindler never broke down crying in real life, scenes like that. Spielberg can't help but gild the lily.)
B001UV4XFG|3.0|This was a Christmas gift so I cannot say if it was good or bad.  They didn't seem to mind getting it as a gift so I guess it was okay.
0802473156|5.0|Love, love love this book. Very easy read and filled with great information for men and women. My husband enjoying it too!
B00A8ECU24|1.0|We didn't really play this game but somehow from the game another game was purchased and when I got my credit card bill noticed that I was charge $19.99 for a gem game that I did not want. Had to contact Amazon to see if I could get the charge removed from my bill. If playing this game make sure that you have the Kindle set so you are not purchasing any of the &#34;extra&#34; things that come up on it. I don't like that they make games for children and then have it set so that they can spend real money not knowing what they are doing. This game has been removed from our Kindle.
B006O3MU96|4.0|Cute game, and very fun when you're bored or on a trip. Takes up time, and it's cool how you can see your previous record, and try to beat it.
B007HC3LHS|4.0|Loved the book.  Could not put it down..  Will read more of her books.  Subject of panic attacks hit home.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldn't put down!  Just as good as the first, can't wait to read the third. Highly recommend for people of all ages.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This author has you on the edge of your seat throughout the whole book. The story leaves you speechless. This author always writes books that capture all ages. I recommend for anyone looking for a good book to get stuck on.
B00634GHJA|4.0|Did what it promised to do so what more could I look for in some other similar app? No complaints here.<br />Now Ima bout to check on this dropbox tip that everyone is so orgasmic for! LOL!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|The newest ads Rovio is using are so obtrusive, that the free game has become almost unplayable. The square ads cover about 1/4 of the playing area and pop up in the middle of play. I'm done playing until they return to a reasonable size ad.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's challenging and requires several different finger touches to control and play the game.  It keeps you thinking and is a lot of fun
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I would recommend this book to any male or female interested in a love story that will make your palms sweat, your breath catch, and your heart thunder! It was great.
B003UBTX7C|5.0|Kept me awake, just had to finish. Scary to think that this type of technology could be developed some day.
1400052181|3.0|The book is memorable but too long for what it was trying to do.I'd rather read a sdynopsis. OK book.
B005LAIH3G|5.0|It's not the best film ever made but, it wraps up one hundred years of filmmaking and it's the one I'll remember if I get to be a hundred. This one picked me up halfway there. Hey, I might even want to live that long now...
B0074EIQQU|3.0|Pretty much like all bands, the older TMV gets the less they rock.  They try to rock but fall way short of their first two masterpieces.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I was a kid when this event happened. And remember all the tv updates on the hostages. But I never knew about Argo. This brought an understanding to the entire series of events.<br />Ben Affleck did a great job, both as actor and director.<br />A must see!
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Wow. So I have been reading nothing but zombie books for about a year so I thought I would change it up a little well I couldn't have done any better an picking a good book. It's kinda like reading a math and science school book but besides all the helpful knowledge you will gain to survive on mars, you will love this book! guaranteed. I'm not to good with reviews but this was a good book with intense moments and comedy and drama it had everything so enjoy.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love this game.  It's very addicting. I am trying to get perfect on every level.  100 down 150 to go.
B00136NUG6|5.0|Great sound. Great acoustics. I would recommend this item.  Awesome.  I will always buy Amazon MP3 individual songs and songs.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I enjoy this game and I think you will to you cat go through train tracks and earn super powers!!!!
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|It is surprisingly addictive. Very fun. The fact it is free makes it even better. But I would spent some money as the graphics are good and the game challenging.
B000V39KDO|3.0|Many Spartan films top this flick, as corny as they come,close to history but to much hollywood effects,it a great story without the smoke and mirrors.
B001PPLIEG|5.0|This dvd movie is off the hook.<br />Daniel Craig is a very, very, good actor and I plus this movie had a lot of action in it.
B0001AP13A|2.0|The vinyl skips during playback on several song. How does a brand new vinyl skip even after cleaning it? Unhappy with product
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Great movie as are all Bruce Willis films in my opinion.Edge of you seat action all the way.Shoot em up
B00A9T1HUO|2.0|Was really hoping for something new and a little different - instead find this selection less compelling than previous albums, and pretty boring really!
B0002VFXFE|5.0|I used this to put a cpu fan on my overclocked, sandy bridge cpu for my first build. Runs at expected temperatures or better. It's thermal paste and it works. Now applying it is a little trickier if you're a novice.<br /><br />1) Use a toothpick.<br />2) Using too much can be as bad as too little! This stuff is not easy to remove.<br />3) You're going to want a thin, even coating where the cpu meets the fan. Start with a VERY small dab and apply more if necessary.<br />4) Connect the fan as instructed without having gobs of excess thermal paste go everywhere.<br />5) You win! Play again?
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|A great surprise for us as a pot smoking teddy never occured to any one in this household  about true as it gets for the the witchy women overbearing beotch.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|This was truly an eye opening book, that shows the humanity and chivalry of the German fighter pilots and the bravery of the US bomber crews under horrible conditions. This book makes one realize that we are all brothers and God is in charge.
B006YM9JSW|5.0|Just as extra warning for novices: make sure you buy a cpu fan for this as one is not included. Yes, you really need that fan. No, you really don't want to try to run it without one.<br />(A toothpick is handy to apply the thermal paste. Start with a dab, you'd be surprised)<br /><br />I was determined to have an i7 for my build and this is definitely the one to go with. If you're not interested in overclocking, great, it's still a good price for the power. And if you do want to overclock, it's actually very easy to do even though this is a \\"locked\\" cpu. I've got mine up to 4.5 and it still runs at a cold temp. It's a good buy.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I didnt have any expecations on reading Silver Linings Playbook. All I knew is that it was about mental illness.<br />When I started reading it, I was hooked. The narrative of it was a little simpler speaking of a 30 year old man. I thought that the things that happened were pretty interesting and I liked the character of Tiffany in her weird funny ways of showing attraction to Pat. I finished the book pretty fast, its not a hard thing to understand but it was definitely heartwearming, emotional, and funny. I really liked it.<br />I also hear its quite different from the movie..i mean,they always are but this one goes way beyond. Ill still watch it.
B004TI5N38|5.0|Great read - lots of action with believable characters.  I like the John Puller character and the way he is developed using unusual family relationships.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|Bottom line<br />If you love Sanderson: You're gonna buy this no matter what I say anyways so just go ahead and give them you're money.<br />If you only kinda like Sanderson: It's a somewhat predictable short story. But if you enjoy thought experiments about what could happen in a world with unique laws you'll probably like it.<br />If you hate Sanderson: Well.. Yeah. You're probably not gonna like this, do I need to bother?<br />If you've never heard of Sanderson: Wait, really? Dear god I envy you. Forget this appetizer, go read [[ASIN:B004H1TQBW Mistborn Trilogy]]. Thank me later.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|An interesting and quick read during my commute. Chapters are good length to follow the story lines and keep up pace.
B004J4WN0I|4.0|My son recommended this book to me and I am now reading the 3rd book in the series.  It's witty and exciting, just an all around enjoyable read.  One of those books you can read a chapter of two and then pick it up a day or two later and get right back into it.  Great.
B00006G8K0|5.0|The older movies are the best! There is nothing like the historic actor Christoper Lee! \\"Easy on the Eyes\\". Very highly recommended! It's true that they just don't make them like this anymore! This is a have to have for the classic horror buff! And with Amazon it was a good price and a quick ship. Thank you to everyone involved in making this movie available!
1451695195|2.0|Not scriptural.  Dying and waking up in goo is not my idea of heaven.  I do not recommend this book to anyone.
B008HT4FUW|4.0|I have not ever watched any of Downton Abbey.  I got it as a gift for my daughter-in-law and she was thrilled with it.<br />Having season 1 and 2 in a set together was a big hit with her.  I may borrow the set from her when she has watched it all, but she has already said she will be watching it over again.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love this book! It's a great unique love story! It will be interesting if they make the movies! I would watch them!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a very good book. The suspense was great because you didn't know what was going to happen or how things would end. This is a must read!!!!
B00354YA4U|4.0|Set is the early sixties, this story is so typical of the period.  Girls were  expected to marry and when  Florence meets Edward he seems the perfect man for her, despite the fact that they are from totally different backgrounds.  She is not interested in the physical side of the relationship and assumes Edward will be happy to live with her in a platonic relationship. She is a talented classical musician and her music provides her with fulfilment.  Edward loves her but is keen to marry quickly so that he can sleep with her.  Both of them are naive about sex.  Florence comes from a wealthy family and  has travelled alone with her father on his boat several times.  Despite these trips Florence and her father have a poor relationship and I was left wondering what happened on those trips that made her so anti any physical contact with Edward.  She is also not close to her mother -  her parents are cold and indifferent to her.  Edward's family has experienced tragedy and life has been a struggle in many ways for them. Neither Edward nor Florence have received any parental guidance about entering into marriage and the obligations and responsibilities marriage brings.  The climax of the book takes place on the beach as each of them tries to deal with the reality of their vastly different sexual desires.
B0051UH6W4|4.0|So unique and intriguing... Our Book Club was spent clarifying, agreeing and disagreeing. We all agreed that it is a clever book and one to be appreciated.
B009K0P10K|5.0|it is great a lot of excitement coming up for the season 2 of revenge.  I just love the program
B0065GC0BA|4.0|An interesting perspective... Our Book Club had an in depth discussion with varying opinions and beliefs centered around the main idea of 'Me before You'. An easy read with lots to think about.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|i lik it--why do i have to keep putting more words in?  comer on now--it would be easier to just forget this
B008AK8FHM|4.0|It was well written and exciting. I liked the chapters that told us what was happening medically mixed with those that told of his experience. Kept my interest.
B00827OXJ2|5.0|The Wachowski's did this film to show they could direct before they did a small film called The Matrix. It is slickly written and directed by them, with sultry performances by Jennifer Tilly and Gina Gershon.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME! I really enjoy playing with my horses and I would highly recommend this game to horse lovers. Anyway I love this game and I hope you will try it and fall in love too.
B007K8ILUQ|2.0|There's a reason Kubrick disowned this film after its release. The movie, while it has an interesting plot, suffers from poor writing, poor acting, and general poor quality. It could have been so much more, granted it was done with a skeleton crew with a low budget, but Kubrick could have tried harder.
B004ZA9HB4|4.0|IMEDIASHARE WORKS EXCELLENT.  ANY IMPROVEMENT WOULD BE IN THE AREA OF MIRRORRING APPLE TVs<br />WITH MIRRORRING, ANDRIOD DEVICES WOULD BETTER APPLE
B00932A3SK|5.0|Just plain awesome... Did not expect it, one of the best films I've seen. I really have nothing negative to say about this film.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I don't like getting a question about another game before I can access a new game of solitaire.  Very tedious
B000FC1JCQ|5.0|I read this book years ago and loved it. Now that I have my Kindle, I bought it for that. I was able to give my book to a friend who is reading it now as well. This may be the 4th time I have read it. This is a different prospective on the legend of King Arther. Read it for your self.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|I can't get into my FB account because it won't recognize my using a different device than the original PC set-up.  I can't remember the answer to the security question.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good!  Enjoyed it very much! Looking forward to the next book! I Can't wait to see what is next.
B00B4MB5Q6|4.0|I just got back from a business trip to Sydney, Australia. Bruce Springsteen is about to embark on a massive tour there (I believe the tour starts later this week), and as so often happens with big name artists touring Down Under, a best-of has been released to coincide with the tour.<br /><br />\\"Collection 1973-2012 Australian Tour Edition 2013\\" (18 tracks; 76 min.) brings a straightforward, and chronological, overview of Bruce's 40 year career, starting with 1973's Rosalita and ending with the title track of last year's Wrecking Ball. There is no new or unissued or remixed or anything \\"different\\" on any of the songs on here. Just Bruce's \\"best\\" in 18 tracks, nothing more, nothing less. And while it goes without saying that a TON of career-defining songs are missing on here, it seems to me that, as a compilation for the casual (?) Springsteen fan, this is pretty much perfect, sticking to his best known songs and biggest hits (even if a bit heavy on the later years). If you wonder why this CD is so expensive, keep in mind that CDs in Australia sell for about twice as much as in the US (in fact, everything there is outrageously expensive as compared to the US, I basically experienced \\"sticker shock\\" on my trip to Sydney).<br /><br />Bottom line: Music: 5 stars; Compilation: 4.5 stars; New relevance: 1 star; Economic value: 2 stars; As souvenir from Sydney trip: 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Track Listing: 1.Rosalita 2.Thunder Road 3.Born To Run 4.Badlands 5.The Promised Land 6.Hungry Heart 7.Atlantic City 8.Born In The U.S.A. 9.Dancing In The Dark 10.Brilliant Disguise 11.Human Touch 12.Streets Of Philadelphia 13.The Ghost of Tom Joad 14.The Rising 15.Radio Nowhere 16.Working on a Dream 17.We Take Care of Our Own 18.Wrecking Ball
B00170MYIS|5.0|SONY LION BATTERIES ARE VERY EXPENSIVE WHEN PURCHASED DIRECT FROM SONY THIS PRODUCT WORKS AS ADVERTISED AND MEETS ALL REQUIREMENTS
B00AJLHUA8|3.0|\\"Sinister\\" doesn't develop very logically. What's more, it invokes a really exotic, far-fetched basis for its menace.  However, there are some memorably eerie, disturbing scenes in the film. So if you're looking more for sensation than for anything strictly sensible, you'll probably find this film worth your time.<br /><br />In addition, there are a lot of good extras on this DVD. There are two fairly interesting director/writer commentaries.<br /><br />Then, among the bonus materials, there is also a brief documentary about the market value fate of any real house which has a gruesome history. Brokers often have trouble selling such properties, at least for a decade or so. After that, purchasers occasionally come forward with the intention of making money off the shocking events that those walls witnessed. The new owners give tours, or challenge people to spend a night among the ghosts of those murders. This DVD documentary focuses on one such house in Villisca, Iowa, where a whole family fell victim to an axe murderer in the early 1900's.<br /><br />So all in all, there's enough on this DVD to keep you watching - and watchful.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|IT WORKS VERY WELL AND IT MAKES SELECTION OF THE BEST CONNECTION FAULTLESS ONE PROBLEM THOUGH YOU MUST HAVE AMAZON APP INSTALLED OR IT WILL NOT WORK!
B00A3NQNUU|2.0|U will get a five star rating from me if u let us send dragons so can u work on that
B00AFEXRME|1.0|That should have been the name of this movie.<br />Flight is about 30 mins.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the first 30 mins of the movie, it was interesting how we are introduced to Denzels character.<br />I know many pilots and his character does not quite fit the mold of a normal pilot, this was very hard for me to look past.<br /><br />After that the movie dives, just like the plane did, however, the movie does not come back up.<br /><br />This is a hodgepodge of yelling, drug use, and morals.<br />It just leaves a bad taste in your mouth and feeling very sad.<br /><br />I wouldn't waste my time, watch one of Denzel's good movies like Book of Eli.
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Now that the novelty has worn off, am going to stand on your coffee table and tell you this is the best Bowie album since Scary Monsters. Dance around it but let's face it, Bowie's sucked over the last 30 years. Ok, there's been a decent to great single here and there but album-wise its been one bone crushing disappointment after another. It got to the point where I couldn't listen to his classic 70's stuff without it being a painful reminder of how low the star had fallen. If he was setting trends before, now he was chasing after them, from Industrial to Drum-n-Bass. The results shallow or at worse dull. But being an unrepentant Bowie addict, I'm a \\"rube\\" waiting to be \\"shilled\\".<br /><br />Despite the excitement of a new single in 10 years, \\"Where Are We Now\\" didn't blow me away and sounded very 80's in a \\" too much brass and fern\\" way. So was prepared to be let down once again, at best hoping for another Heathen (Bowie's most commendable since Let's Dance).<br /><br />Imagine my surprise when I was greeted with an opening track which sounded like like a cross between Scary Monsters & Lodger. \\"Dirty Boys\\" with its growling, sinister baritone sax recalled moments off side 2 of Heroes.<br /><br />The poppy but sinister \\"Valentine's Day\\" has the simplicity and catchy melody missing from much of his work since Let's Dance. While no where near as groundbreaking as anything off Low, \\"If You Can See Me\\" shows a restless sense of experimentation hasn't completely retired. \\"I'd Rather Be High\\" could be more self-satire than parody if it weren't set in a war zone. Regardless, its one of album's highlights.<br /><br />\\"You Feel So Lonely You Could Die\\" is one of the best ballads Bowie has cut in a long, long time. Gorgeous and inspiring, ending with a sly musical nod to \\"Five Years\\". One of many musical \\"in jokes\\" on here. \\"Heat\\" ends things on a very Scott Walker note. As for the bonus tracks, all 3 are indispensable. Especially \\"So She\\". And \\"I'll Take You There\\" ends it all on a more energetic note than the atmospheric \\"Heat\\". So there's no reason not to fall for the marketing ploy of the \\"Deluxe\\" version.<br /><br />Will confess, even \\"Where Are We Now\\" has grown on me after repeated listens. It has that slow burning quality that marks Bowie's most enduring work.But since taste is subjective, its unrealistic to expect every track to hold equal attraction. But there's no single moment that makes me wince, shrug, roll my eyes or sigh. Stuff I missed at first listen, now stands out. As Lennon once sang, this album plays like a Glass Onion. More you dig into it, the more you find.<br /><br />Bowie wisely keeps the tracks under the 5 minute mark, curtailing his past tendency to throw everything but the kitchen sink into the mix. The songs have warmth, depth and space. Dense enough in all the right places to reveal new things with each listen. Thank Tony Visconti, producer of much of Bowie's classic 70's work. If one misses Robert Fripp or Adrian Belew, guitarists David Torn and Earl Slick (Station To Station) more than make up for it.<br /><br />If you ask me this sounds like a Bowie album, as opposed to an album trying to \\"be\\" a \\"Bowie\\" album. And that's pretty much how I'd characterize his work since Scary Monsters. Sounds of being one's own boss again as opposed to going through the motions.<br /><br />Despite the joke on the cover, this is no Heroes or Station To Station. There's nothing groundbreaking here. Nor is it striving to be. The aim here isn't to conquer the world. Its to say hello to fans and try to give them a little what they've been asking for. After 10 years off, it also seems born of some inner artistic need. So take it from this seasoned, oft disappointed veteran, happy to report this one's well worth the wait. I'm finding it to be the kind of record I can play over & over and not get sick of. Thank you, David.ll on a more energetic note than the atmospheric \\"Heat\\".

B00785P2QC|5.0|This game is not quite as fun as Simcity, but I like it.  Easy game to catch on to and play. Would recommend it to anyone.
0321701763|5.0|When I really need to use it for my class, it was out at Barne & Noble and I had to get it before the professor fail me!
0525478817|5.0|The book arrived much earlier than I anticipated in great condition and is brand new. I love it and can't wait to read it since I've heard so many great things about it.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is awesome if you are a horse lover! The picture is great and it has amazing graphics. It gives you the Idea of what a horse will actually do and need.
B007MCTTHY|4.0|this game provides lots of levels with increasing difficulty - I found it just challenging enough to keep me from being bored. it has no annoying, unneccesary permissions and installed and plays fine on my first gen kindle. its perfect for filling time when you need a distraction but not total absorption into a game. I don't think I would have bought this - but if I had I wouldn't be totally upset about my purchase.
B004TJ1H3C|5.0|Love the storyline, actors and pretty much everything. Like the fact that the actors from the original SG1 is in it.
B004DD3LAQ|4.0|Atmospheric and rocking, fun and futuristic, still sounds like it was made yesterday. A classic of Guitar shredding fun.  One of the best at top form.
0765325950|5.0|I give this book all 5 Stars. I loved the ending. The action throughout the whole book was endless. Countless emotions running through my mind for the whole day. Literally could NOT put this book down. I dont think I even went to the bathroom. AMAZING read! I would recomend it to any fan of the Rand Al'Thor, The Lord Dragon Reborn. It makes me so sad to see this story coming to an end. Ive grown up with these characters. They wont be missed as I have the whole set in my closet, and look forward to seeing that they are well used. Thanks for for reading:)
B000W292C8|5.0|This is it.  the crossroads between the Ramones and Elvis Costello, who cares if it came a few years late.  The line between the two music was never more clear and never as united.
B000L3CHC0|5.0|I have the leather strap version of this watch also but wanted something more durable and the stainless steel band version is just as nice.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|If you haven't seen the late, lamented Firefly series, watch it first before you watch Serenity.<br /><br />That said, Serenity is a satisfactory conclusion to a tragically short series. It doesn't tie up all lose ends, but it does address quite a few while sticking with the winning combination of character-driven storylines, memorable characters and dialog, Western gritty ruggedness, space opera grandeur and gorgeous visuals that won over so many &#34;Browncoats&#34; (Firefly fans).
B000Q7ZO8U|5.0|An impressive visual array of effects in 3D made even better by the superior quality of Blu-ray.  Well worth owning.
B009UNGYHG|5.0|Love this bluetooth.  Sometimes I forget I am wearing it.  Reception is crystal clear and people on the other end say the same.  I like the voice dial and handsfree answer feature.  The battery lasts a long time between charging.  Highly recommend this headset
B004FEFS5E|5.0|This book will prove very helpful to any level of photographer. If you will follow his instructions, your pictures are bound to improve greatly.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a game I used to play with real cards back in the olden days it was not nearly as fun than as it is now on my kindle fire really enjoy it especially since I win so often winning is fun anyone who likes card games will love this I play it more than I watch TV!!LOL
B008XBCJ34|5.0|The 3D version of Avatar is an excellent movie to watch. My wife and I enjoy the movie in blue-ray but enjoyed it more in the 3D version. We saw details that we didn't notice in the blue-ray version. A must for 3d collection
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Cute and unique, quick read. Loved the story. Fairytale like, but still very real. I would recommend it to a friend.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|awesome love get it u will love it so much better tan first one get it for free right now
B0047SF41G|3.0|Liked it a lot, Adrien Brody is awesome in this, would have preferred to to see the full version of the movie though. They shouldn't have cut all the dialogue that they did for the Instant Video - I think it degraded the quality of the film. If you are looking for the full version of this movie, don't rent this on Instant Video.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|We love Stargate Atlantis.  The whole storyline is written and played out very well.  We do home marathons on the weekends when not out and about saving our own world.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Great game. Keeps me entertained and fun game I can take with me any where. :) whole family enjoys! :)
B009UX2YAC|4.0|well for starters I think this is some kind of rip off to Temple Run. it takes some time to get used to and it allows you to PURCHASE with your own $ for characters! that's ridiculous for a free game.
B008B68IEA|4.0|My 8-yr old loves this Abbey bed.  It is very unique and seems well made.  Easy to assemble, just a few pieces to snap together.  The colors are \\"icy\\" beautiful and as pictured. Set comes with a pretty pillow and cute bedspread, along with a pet bed.  Note:  Better pricing at Toys R Us.  Goes perfect with any of the MH Abbey dolls.
B0063IH60K|3.0|It's ok if you want to choose winning game or random game.....but I do like the option of changing the type of solitary games.....which this does not have.
1400069289|5.0|It is a great book! Easy to read, and filled with interesting stories and knowledge about habits. I learned a lot about my bad habits and how I can change them.
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Good movie.  Excuse the pun, but this movie reeked of irony.  All the years he must have driven and flown drunk, high, and/or stoned, and never hurt or killed anyone, at least by his driving or flying.  And then he does something no other person could have done and saved all those people.... and gets busted.
B005LAII3U|5.0|Great product and been looking to get this for a while! Got the product cheaper than I had anticipated and was very satisfied!!!!
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Not much different from the original Angry Birds, but it is super cute. You have to save these adorable little birds out of cages.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Great product and been looking to get this for a while! Got the product cheaper than I had anticipated and was very satisfied!!!!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I really enjoy Ken Follets story telling and his development of characters with great historical stories, but this story seemed to go a little stale about 2/3 of the way through.  All in all still a very enjoyable book.
0785163174|5.0|Great product and been looking to get this for a while! Got the product cheaper than I had anticipated and was very satisfied!!!!
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I thought that this book was fantastic until I got to the end.  The end--the reason for the murders--did not, in my mind, justify the means--the murders themselves.  I expected a stronger, more complex ending.
1401233376|5.0|Great product and been looking to get this for a while! Got the product cheaper than I had anticipated and was very satisfied!!!!
0399160450|5.0|She loves it which means I am a very happy customer. Thanks a lot for getting it to her so fast!
0316017922|5.0|I am enjoying reading this required book for class, learning new ways to improve learning strategies, and interesting stories .
B00AANGHXQ|5.0|I mourned the loss of Stevie Ray as if he was a dear friend.  I have every single thing he ever recorded so this had to be added to my collection.  I especially love the cd 2, the live concert.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I thought all I needed was the on-board battery indicator, but I was wrong. I really like this much more accurate meter, especially being able to see exactly how much time I have left (in minutes) for each function (video, music, surfing, apps,etc.)  A quick look tells me I have enough time to watch the long movie, or finish my e-mails. Works great, no problems. One of the most helpful apps I've ever downloaded.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|So handy!! I love the cover options and the multiple pages. It's great for getting things organized, and it is free!
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This cover is so strong, yet so light!  I love the protection it provides my Kindle.  When watching videos, the kickstand feature is very nice to have.  I would recommend it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this app is awesome . I'd recommend it to everyone . my favorite part is the zipline and when you get diamonds for free
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It's nice to be able to see exactly how much power is left whenever I need to know.  Would recommend.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|Cool game with awesome weapons to buy and make. Like a military Sims game.you can ally or battle other online players too.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Every night before I go to sleep I check this app to see what tomorrow's weather will be.  It's super handy to have available.
B00571F26Y|4.0|Its a pretty straight forward book, with simple to read explanantions with why wheat is unhealthy.  Im a huge science geek, have a BA in Zoology and most of all literature explaining the history of wheat genetic modifications is on point. I love how Dr.Davis doesnt shy away from being truthful and gives you option to try to feel the difference yourself with eating GMO's versus non-GMO's.  Im a vegan, and even with my choice not to eat any animal products GMO's still exist and I can feel the difference immediately.  For those trying to change eating habits, and need a simple read. I Pick This Book.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I found this app to be easy to use and fast.  I would recommend it to facebook junkies like me, unfortunately.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Thank goodness for Amazon!!!  Just finished watching Season 2 barely on Blockbuster - was sent discs out of sync and one that didn't even work.  Amazon is a dream.  Ordered the whole Season 3 and am able to EASILY watch it on my iMac.  Well worth the $$$ -- please offer Season 4 and Season 5 when available.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I have been a Nicholas Sparks fan for several years now.  He did not disappoint with this one.  There is great insight into the characters and the domestic violence situation they deal with.  It's nice to see a woman who is a victim of domestic violence being portrayed as a strong intelligent person caught in a bad situation instead of being portrayed as either an all around loser or damsel in distress.  A winner of a book.
B00000AOUD|1.0|The worst prog album I've ever heard. Don't buy it or you will throw money in the garbage. If I could I'd put nor a only star.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a good old fashioned soap opera.  The period costumes and predjudices make it delicious to watch. Keep it up!
B000FC0V3E|2.0|We read this book for our book club after reading The Paris Wife the month before.  I think Hemingway is much more of a man's writer plus all that prodigious drinking by all the characters really turned me off.
B005SAJJHM|5.0|I love this show, no dislikes about the product and affordable. Would recommend this to others looking for a good show to watch.
B000FIMG68|5.0|The shipment was incredibly fast and I've has no problems whatsoever with the DVD's playing.  The service was great and I would definitely recommend this!!!
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|This album reminds me of the first (and hopefully not last) time I saw Mr. Bowie in concert, during the amazing \\"Reality\\" tour. I was fortunate enough to be right behind the main pit area, on a slight incline so I had an amazing view throughout the whole show. I was 22 years old at the time and had been waiting for what felt like most of my life to be old enough to see my favorite musician in concert. Yeah, I know 22 years is not long at all in some cases, but in my case it felt like forever. I grew up with \\"Ziggy Stardust\\" being played at maximum volume on my parent's record player. I learned to love fashion and art and music and Jim Henson and all the different kinds of people in the world because of Mr. Bowie.<br />However, I'll listen to \\"New Killer Star\\" any day over \\"Let's Dance.\\"<br />So that brings me back to the review and the concert.<br />There I am, experiencing the closest thing to nirvana in my life. He opened with \\"Rebel, Rebel\\" and everyone around me was cheering and dancing and then the music swung into \\"Pablo Picasso.\\" A couple next to me, in their late 30s, maybe early 40s start shouting at each other. \\"What is this? It's weird!\\" \\"It's from that new album!\\" (Seriously?) \\"Oh, I didn't listen to it! I only like his old stuff!\\" \\"I know, right?\\"<br />But that was just the start of it. In front of me, the enthusiastic pit was having the time of their lives. But around me, with song after song that wasn't \\"old stuff,\\" I realized that there was a sizable number of people settling into their folding chairs. They only stood up when said \\"old stuff\\" was played.<br />I wanted to know why the heck these people were even here, if they weren't going to be supportive of the very reason that they were at this concert.<br />I didn't understand it and it left a very, very minor bitter aftertaste to an amazing evening.<br />So in retrospect, here is what I say to those \\"old stuff\\" people: This is David Bowie, raw and open and aching and reflective and laughing and mocking and wistful and dismissive. It is not going to be filled with crooned, soaring ballads or rock anthems that galvanize the youth. This is music from a man in his 60s who has seen and done a heck of a lot in life. His voice has an edge to it that beautifully serves the lyrics that are oftentimes dark and disquieting. This is not Major Tom, Ziggy, Aladdin Sane, the Thin White Duke, a Cracked Actor, or a Bleached Blonde Arena-Filling Idol. It's not even Nathan Adler. This is Bowie, as Bowie.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I think this book is the best of the three. This is my second time reading this series and I am enjoying it very much. I know that the writing could be better and the sev scenes are repetitive but, I love the romance of this couple. I love how in this book you see such a change in Christian. He is coming around and realizing how wonderful things can be with Ana. You have to give it to Ana where most of us would of run she is defiantly sticking by her man.
B0052U6HM8|5.0|It's definitely different to change from regular shoes to barefoot shoes, do it gradually or you will be sore! These shoes are great! I chose not to get the mesh top trail glove just because I was worried about rain ( I walk everywhere) and these puppies are straight up waterproof. The water beads up and rolls right off! And so easy to wash! I highly recommend them. Also for sizing since a lot of people are worried, i found it easier to go by the Euro Size esp if you switch btw mens and womens. For instance I am a 41 to a 41.5 so in mens thats anywhere from 71/2 to 81/2 or womens usually a 10 to 101/2. If you plan on wearing socks with them like some do ( its easier in the transition phase) than order a half size bigger. other than that find a size of yours that fits and check the Euro!<br />Peace be with You
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I use FB most every day. I keep up with the younger members of my family. I love the Shih Tzu pictures and information people put on FB.
B005I4JG80|4.0|I am newly pregnant and this book had lots of insightful information on how babies/children are raised in France.  The French have a very different philosophy on raising children than Americans do and I found it to be very interesting.  I will definitely consider some of the recommendations when I have a newborn.  It just seemed to make sense.  It was also a very funny book!  I was laughing out loud through a majority of it.  Very easy to read and worth it.  I'll be checking out her newest book Bebe Day by Day next.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|so big on my kindle I love it its just so bright and amazing very good.game is super fun but it
B007V508CC|5.0|excelent CD, one of the best of maroon 5! I really love it. I otally recomended it. love maroon 5
1455508977|5.0|One of my roommates started reading The Lucky One by Nicholas Sparks when she found out that they were making the movie starring Zac Efron. She finished it quickly and suggested that I read it. I already had the book downloaded on my nook so I gave it a shot. The key is making it through the first couple chapters. To be honest, I was confused and from what I knew about the book I wasn't even sure I was reading the right one. But it turns into a sweet love story shortly after that, confirming that you do in fact have the right book in your hand.<br /><br />Logan Thibault walks from Colorado to Hampton, NC, not sure that he's even headed to the right Hampton, to find the girl in the picture he found while he was in Iraq with the Marines. Yes, I know it sounds really cheesy. It's really not. I don't want to give anything way, but Nicholas Sparks's novels are known to cause tears, but this one didn't make me cry. Okay, there were almost tears.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book. It was a light read, and if I had that kind of time, I could've read it in a couple days.
B0060MYM3S|4.0|I think the first season is better.  I watched this before I started reading the books n wasn't really satisfied with it.  After I read the books I realize they left out too much. But s*** it's game of thrones! I had to buy it!!
B0047GNCSU|4.0|This book is funny and well written. The characters are a couple years out of high school and just moved to LA on their own. Jane is interning with a major event planner and Scarlett is starting her first year at USC when they're approached by a producer who puts them on a reality show, L.A. Candy, that changes their lives around.<br /><br />Only someone who's been on a reality show can perfectly detail the way that reality television works. Jane and Scarlett quickly find out what many viewers have guessed at, it's not full reality. I'll definitely be looking at the rest of this series.
0553103547|5.0|After ready this and watch the show I had the buy the other four that's how amazing this and the other books are. A great series of books to read
030758836X|5.0|Gillian Flynn's Gone Girl is phenomenal. I had already downloaded this book when a friend of friend was talking about how good it is. I was afraid that she might have spoiled it for me when she said, \\"you don't know if the husband killed her or not.\\" But that's really just the plot of the book.<br /><br />On the morning of Nick and Amy Dunne's fifth anniversary, Amy disappears and Nick is automatically a suspect. The whole first part of the book you don't know if he killed her. And I spent the whole time going back and forth. \\"I don't think he killed her.\\" \\"He definitely killed her.\\" \\"No, he's probably innocent.\\" \\"Well, maybe he did kill her.\\" I'm not kidding.<br /><br />Get ready for a few jaw-drop worthy surprises throughout the book, and be prepared to have trouble putting it down. I read every night until I was just too tired to go on. If you like mystery books, or even just well written books, I highly recommend Gone Girl. I wasn't a huge fan of the ending, but the journey to the end is well worth it.
0553106635|5.0|Can't wait to watch it on HBO they better not disappoint! Love these books once you start ready you just can't stop!
0440242401|3.0|Lexi Smart is in a car crash and loses the last three years of her memory. I started reading this around the same I watched The Vow and they're oddly similar. Lexi wakes up a husband she's never met before and finds out that her life is nothing like she remembers it being.<br /><br />It starts out really exciting. She wakes up and she's this totally different person, and I find myself anxiously flipping pages to find out who she's become. But then somewhere in the middle it starts to slow down. The book drags on about her confusion about everything and everything that's going wrong in this life she can't remember.<br /><br />But toward the end, it picks back up again. We get to the good stuff, and in typical chick-lit fashion, things start to come together and get exciting.<br /><br />It's not my favorite book, and I wouldn't go recommending it to all of my friends. But, it is a good, light read. Take it with you to the beach or on a plane if you're looking for some light chick-lit.
0553801503|4.0|Too drawn out I was very disappointed so many characters where left out but it's still a good ready especially to the end like all his books
1451696191|5.0|I've always heard good things about Stephen Chbosky's The Perks of Being a Wallflower. It's been on my to-read list for a long time. It's a coming-of-age story about a high school freshman named Charlie. The book consists of a series of letters that Charlie writes to a stranger who he's heard is good at listening and not sharing. It's very real and honest. I connect with Charlie in a way that I didn't really expect to, but it takes me back to my own high school self, regardless of the fact that we don't have much in common. It really addresses those universal ideas of love and loneliness and friendship that anyone can relate regardless of age or social status or any other relevant factor. It takes us through the ups and downs of Charlie's freshman year and his past. He has a complicated relationship with his older sister who has her own share of problems, an almost nonexistent relationship with his older brother who plays college football and a seemingly untraditional relationship with parents. His best friends are all seniors. Each of them have their own perfectly crafted personality and voice even though the letters are from Charlie's point of view.
0553108034|5.0|Much better than the HBO series (of course) could not put it done once I started reading just buy it
0446547573|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this novel. There was just the right amount of suspense and if sleep weren't something that I really needed, I probably would've finished this book in one night.<br /><br />Katie moves to Southport, NC for a fresh start. She's running away from her old life and hoping that it won't catch up with her in her new small town life. The way that the novel unfolds, you get bits and pieces of the life that she left in Boston that leave you wanting more. And by the end, her whole story comes together, and without the tears that I usually expect from a Nicholas Sparks books.<br /><br />With spring break coming up for some of you, and summer around the corner for the rest of us, this will make for a great beach read or even just a quick read for when you're dreaming of vacation.
B00000JQ0E|5.0|Had been looking for this item for awhile. Glad I found it and for a great price. Sounds amazing. Thank you!!!
B001NLKT60|5.0|As an adult I have just started reading again so I cannot compare this to many other  books, but I can say that I very much enjoyed it.  Suspenseful, smart, thought provoking.  I can't wait it read book number 3.
B000059MEL|5.0|Was super excited to get it in. Did not take long to arrive and once I played it, it sounded great.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|If you like super heroes of Marvel this is your movie, good story, good action, you will enjoy from beginning to end and you'll laugh a little, what else do you want?<br /><br />ps.<br />The 3D effect of this edition is something soft and well made, you can enjoy fine without straining your eyes
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Good book, couldn't put it down. A must read for everyone. Going to read it again soon. Am currently reading the third one right now
0385512058|3.0|Catchy title. Average book. There are some good points but the delivery is annoying. Keith has a high opinion of himself. This got in the way. I found that I didn't really like him.<br /><br />I've seen Keith live and again found him too salesy.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It looked pretty but I was sure what to do with it!  My daughter set me straight and I was hooked after the first game.  Sat her for four hours just playing over and over.  Don't really care it I beat my own score,,,,it's just fun to find the matches.  I feel so relaxed and happy after a a couple hours it makes me really sleep good.  Going to have to go a very long way to find a game that will out-do Cubistry in my game life.  Ca't write anymore because just seeing the Cubistry logo in the upper left corner had made me start to shiver with excitement to get start on a new game.  Thanks for adding this game to your list of games.  Bye now, Cubistry is calling.
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I took my children to this in the theater and once it came out, we just had to get it! Very cute and funny and enjoyable for the whole family. I don't say -Blah, blah blah - LOL! That is my favorite part of the whole movie... I recommend this to anyone that enjoys a Family movie :)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|gets you thinking. just wish there was a way to earn more hints. great waste of time. I am addicted
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Hi this game is so cool and its great for all the family my whole family love it I could play it all day long, thanks again.<br /><br />  LOVE FROM<br /><br />  KAITLIN<br />  XXX
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|Brandon Sanderson's, &#34;The Emperor's Soul&#34; had a fascinating premise with a truly unique magical concept behind it.  Despite the short format, the characters were thoroughly engaging and relatable. I really wish there was more to read of Shai and Gaotona; I would come back to this Empire again and again. I particularly like the element of political intrigue that served as a secondary undercurrent to the plot.  On a scale of 1-5, this novella was easily a 6.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Addictive. Best free game. Best racing I've found. A mixture of temple run and Mario kart. Great game most fun game.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great, child-friendly app, with plenty to keep the young ones entertained. Quite addictive for adults too! Would recommend this highly.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I thought this book allowed me to escape reality and dream of a magic circus....loved it! The book was amazing overall!
B00B2166BS|5.0|It works!  Easy to connect (only holds firmly in one way) and it charges quicker.  No hunting for the USB port with this.  I keep my Nexus 10 in a desktop tablet stand on a side table, so charging is now a one-handed affair.  I also really appreciate the magnetic grip. All devices should have this, IMO.
B007FTZDN8|5.0|If you like TED, you'll love this. Bring intelligent, thought provoking ideas with you where ever you go. New talks are added all the time, and learning is half the battle. Hope this helps.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|One of the best serries I have seen in a long time.  I would definitely recommend this show to anyone who likes action shows or superhero type shows.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Execellent combination of suspense and horror. Plot twists that keeps you guessing and a great storyline that makes you want to see more.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I recommend this series to all of those who love any of the following: horror, mystery, suspense, dark comedy, battles between good and evil, God and Satan, Joseph Fiennes, Jessica Lange, Six Feet Under or have a facscination with serial killers. The characters are interesting and have depth.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. Continued character development was good. Got to learn a whole new depth to some characters. Conan was like a flower bursting open and coming into full bloom. Loved it all.
B008220DGE|3.0|Freddie Quell (Joaquin Phoenix) is a WWII vet with anger management issues. He is obsessed with sex (more than the rest of us) and loves his drink. After numerous altercations, Freddie ends up as a stowaway on the yacht of The Master, Lancaster Dodd (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Dodd is also a hot head who likes his drink and previously had an altercation with Freddie, one that he can't remember, while he can recall past lives. He believes Freddie's familiar face must be from one of them.<br /><br />Dodd is a cult leader of a movement called \\"The Cause\\" which gets it name from the fact that if they used \\"Scientology\\" they would get sued. The fact that Hollywood would make what is unmistakably an anti-Scientology film is remarkable in itself.<br /><br />Freddie is a wild cannon who threatens to derail the movement with his violent tendencies and lust. The Master sees him as a work in progress, one that he must conquer in order to justify his ideas to himself. His family doesn't see it that way. Good acting but the film seemed to be either poorly edited, or written, as the plot lacked proper direction and flow in relationship to the theme...which I am sure it had one if not a dozen of them.<br /><br />Parental Guide: F-bomb, sex, masturbation, full frontal nudity.
B000I8G5B2|4.0|Set in the not-too-distant future, GATTACA depicts a world in which genetic engineering leads to the production of Nietzschean ubermenschen, or super-people, who are the only ones entitled to go on elite space missions.  Through an accident of birth, Vincent Freeman (Ethan Hawke), finds himself part of an inferior race; but exchanges identity with Jerome Morrow (Jude Law), who has the elite birth but lacks mobility.  Jerome gives Vincent his blood, eyelashes and other aspects of his personality: Vincent plays the part convincingly.  However things start to go wrong when a murder takes place, and Detective Hugo (Alan Arkin) goes in pursuit of the perpetrator.  The film contains plenty of futuristic costumes and settings, but its subject-matter is set firmly in the present, concerning the importance of fulfilling one's dreams, even if it means exchanging aspects of one's identity for another.  Hawke turns in a convincing performance; but the end of the film we admire him for the way in which he triumphs over adversity to achieve his goal.  Gore Vidal turns up in a cameo role as Director Josef, the boss of the elite unit; it seems appropriate that such a unique personality, who spent his life undergoing just the same trials that Vincent does in the film, should be cast in such a role.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It was a good book but if you love dogs you have a good idea what part of the ending is going to be. I would decide I would not read anymore for my love of dogs but I kept picking it up until I got to the end. Then the tears flowed.
B003NHRIVQ|5.0|This is a dvd worth buying.  The storyline is so good.  Miley and Liam do a wonderful job with their parts and the sparks between them look real. Touching and keeps your attention from beginning to end.  Highly recommend!
B003MS0UHU|4.0|This video was good to watch and enjoyable.  Not what I expected for a sequel though.  I didn't see as much NEW adventures, nor more intense characteristics of the animals.  Enjoyed, but would have like more of a change in adventure and ending.  Nice movie for kids though.
B00BHMF578|5.0|Solid script, directing and acting. Because I like this kind of movie (historical drama thriller), I would give it the old 4 stars rating. Anyone else would be hard pressed not to give it at least 3 stars. The historical part --especially the ending -- is not entirely accurate, but it does add to the drama.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I was not familiar with this story that was a part of the Iranian hostage crisis.  This story is so well written and directed, I will have to buy it.
B004OZZ624|4.0|Great story with good suspense. This movie line kept you going the entire time. A little long, but well worth the watch..
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Read the hunger games about a year ago. Could not put the books down! Stayed up all night reading constantly and kept sneaking and reading them at work! It was such an engaging story I was unable to focus on anything else until I was finished! When I found that Amazon had the whole trilogy on Kindle for 5 dollars I knew I had to snatch it up quick because it is definitely a series that I will reread. ( I loaned my physical books out all three of them and never got them back again :(  )  I loved Katniss's relationship with Prim. it is exactly the type of relationship that I have with my sisters. I loved that Prim had her own kind of strength that was much different from Katniss's but she was still a very strong young women just in a different way. I loved how Prim and Katniss, Peeta and many other characters made the choice to sacrifice and do the right thing no matter how hard it was. Amazing book, and yes, despite the violence good for kids. In today's world too many people choose whats easy over whats right and this book shows kids that whats right is always better than whats easy.
B00BKTWBMA|2.0|I did not purchase this. I did listen to the preview songs then borrowed it from a friend. I am very disappointed.  It seems EC has no soul or heart on these tracks. I am a 40+ years fan. I hope his next effort is better.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I liked that the book captured my attention from page one. I laughed and cried with every climax of each section of the book. This book is a story that every one can enjoy.
B00000331V|5.0|I've had this album for a long time on vinyl, recently purchased this new CD and after several listens, (all the comparisons to the other great American live acts of the day IE; The Allman Brothers Band, Little Feat, The Band) are true. Not that they sounded like any of those groups, they were an R&B influenced band, and there major influence was the Rolling Stones and all the great blues and R&B artists. If I were to compare the J. Geils Band to anyone, it would be their southern brethren, Wet Willie. Both bands were excellent R&B influenced rock bands, and each commanded the stage in their live performances. I had the chance to see both bands back in the day, and yes they do put on excellent live shows. Anyways........ I won't go into any detail about the artists or the songs on this album, I am sure it's covered quite well here somewhere, I will just say that this is one of the great American live rock albums of the 70's. It ranks right up there with ABB's \\"Live at the Fillmore\\", Little Feats \\"Waiting for Columbus\\", Bob Seger's \\"Live Bullet\\", their own previously released \\"Full House\\" \\"Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"One More From the Road\\", The Bands \\"The Last Waltz\\"...... Supposedly this album has been remastered, and that's all it says on the album cover, remastered, don't see the word digitally anywhere. But it sounds pretty good. I have only listened to this CD in the car or on the computer so I would need to give it a good sonic workout on one of my home sound systems, then I could give the actual sound quality an honest rating. But, know matter what, the music and the musicianship make up for it. I'd love to hear this crankin' through the ol' Altec's, Klipsch's or Polk Audio's and play it loud, the way it was meant to be played. Think I might just have to give this a spin and irritate the neighbors.
0988262592|5.0|I got this book at the RSA conference in San Francisco 2013 and it took me less than a week to read it.  Some of the ideas were new to me and will keep me busy doing research for more info.  I also gave my friend who's a Director in the Security team for a large IT firm a copy and he loved it. He says is has a practical take on security and a balanced view of Technology, People, Process, Metrics.<br /><br />Great read if you are in a large company with many departments.  For a smaller shop it might be less relevant. IR
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun to play but tempting to spend real money. overall good time killer and enjoyable. I would download it again.
B00AIUUXHC|3.0|I like this shark app! You chase fish to grow in to a bigger shark and get to the next level
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|OH MY GOSH!!!!!! I LOVED IT!!!!!! COULDN'T BE A BETTER BOOK!!!! IF THE SERIES WENT ON, IT'S JUST SO AMAZING!!!!!!
B000W0AZ5S|5.0|Just after seven years of increased experience as a session bassist and several<br />  years achieving his music education in jazz after starting out as a session bassist on<br />  the New York jazz circuit, Christian McBride became an overnight sensation in 1995<br />  when he released his highly publicized debut album that made him a bold new force.<br />  Showcasing his striking virtuosity and creative solos on his acoustic bass, the young<br />  jazz titan took the world of jazz by storm with Gettin' To It, the blockbuster debut CD,<br />  which won critical praise, great respect from fellow jazz musicians, and chart-topping<br />  success on the jazz charts throughout the year. Highlighted by it's stunning track set,<br />  starting off with dashing opening track In A Hurry, the album feature an array of solid<br />  original compositions like Shade Of The Cedar Tree, Sittin' On A Cloud, Black Moon,<br />  King Freddie Of Hubbard (an homage to Freddie Hubbard) and the funk oriented title<br />  track, as well as a few enduring takes on standards including Too Close For Comfort,<br />  Count Basie's Splanky--where he jams it out with Ray Brown--and even the haunting<br />  bass final on Night Train.  Hailed by Time Magazine as \\"The Best And Most Versatile<br />  Jazz Bassist Since Charles Mingus\\", Gettin' To It serves up an epitomized mixture of<br />  swinging post-bop, relaxing acoustic tracks and uplifting merit as this session feature<br />  a brilliant band line-up consisting of Roy Hargrove, Joshua Redman, Steve Turre and<br />  Cyrus Chestnut, which make this first-time masterpiece a true beginning of the a long<br />  and celebrated music career of this magnificent jazz giant and to what we will expect<br />  to hear from him.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Jammed till I can't jam any more ;) Rihanna did a great job on this one. Fun, exciting, makes you wanna move.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I use this app to fall asleep quickly on a nearly nightly basis.  The binaural beats in particular I am very pleased with.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Very challenging. Enjoy when the screens change to keep the game interesting<br />I would play this game again and again.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Really good movie. I waited a long time to see it and it was worth the wait.  I would do it again.
0696204800|1.0|I was looking for a reference book for a multitude of blocks so I could pick and choose among them.  Great, I thought, 501 blocks!  Instead I get what is out of 501 relatively few pieced blocks (all 4\\" and without a reference for easy resizing) and a lot of very poorly designed applique.  Many blocks look like they were drawn by a 4 year old.  Well, when you plan for 4\\" blocks some people accept a design that SORT of looks like what it represents.  I wish I had known how poorly the applique blocks were and that this is NOT a compendium of 501 useable blocks.  I wish I had known that the blocks were 4\\" and the book was obviously not created to be a reference.  I wish I had known this before I opened it up.  Well, I can always donate it to a library so others can find out how unusable it is without buying it.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|I wasn't expecting these cards to arrive so soon. And with a little note with it, too!<br />It was too cute. I absolutely love these cards.<br />They're so thin, and smooth.<br />I let no one touch them except me, hahah.<br />Awesome in my opinion!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Like the variety of prizes and powers.  The new scenarios were a nice touch.  Provides hours of fun.  Often people on the plane will inquire about the game.  I highly recommend it for all ages.
B00BP4Z8XY|4.0|Wreck it Ralph has it for everyone in the family, entertaining enough and funny for the little kids and with its references to the games of old, nostagic for the adults.  I liked the movie and think it is worth a rent or purchase as it will entertain everyone of all ages.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was not as captivating as The Hunger Games, until the end. However, it was really good and only makes me can't wait to read the third book. I love the thought process that the author gives to Katniss. I like how everything happens for a reason and all the thoughts match up in the end.
B008Y1YK9Y|5.0|Thought it was the best of the triliogy and tied it all together.  It wasn't predictable and that made it enjoyable.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|I love this keyboard. I was an avid user of Swype but the prediction is way better and I love the &quot;flow&quot; which makes scrawling out messages quicker than average.  The only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the lack of Japanese language support. Otherwise it's awesome.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Timeless classic! I read it once as a child and reread it now at least ten years later. I loved reading this heartfelt and charming story, although it was tough reading through the spoken Yorkshire dialect in some parts.
B0001US62I|5.0|A very phenomenal, curious film. I am amazed at how many characters Robert DiNero can portray. As well, Mickey Rourke, once again gives a mixed character tortured by personal demons. Veryinteresting. Again, never really given a hint towards an unusual ending.
B007FEZQF8|5.0|Graphics and story line are awesome!  I would definitely recommend this comic! Very entertaining and provocative at the same time.
B00AA0TZTW|2.0|Read the long reviews on here from long time fans. I am going to sadly agree with the negative voices here. This is really scrapping the bottom for more Jim and it's been marketed almost like it's a \\"new\\" CD!<br /><br />These tunes would be best left to their secondary label, Dagger or even just sold as single MP3 downloads for us hard core collectors.<br /><br />* Slight Return Update ... I just listened to the old Alan Douglas mixes and the recent releases from the family. I am more impressed than I was 35 years ago today with the AD mixes. He did not have the master tapes and the public demanded \\"new\\" Hendrix music. However, I am glad his music is in the hands of family members. Janie has done some great things (like the 1997 mixes of his official catalog) I just wish she would open the vaults to the Amazon downloader and let us pick and choose for our collections. Download them for $1.29 a song.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|While hundreds had reviews this movie and were thrilled by another Will Smith block buster, I had to add my short statement of fact. I watched it, I bought it, shared it and rewatched it whenever I thought I had problems and there was nothing I could do about them. The answer to this TRUE STORY is \\"You do what you can do till you can't do it anymore, then do it\\".
B001609SQA|5.0|Ok, i gotta say that the first 3 ALIEN movies are BY FAR the BEST sci-fi action movies of all time(sorry, star wars, it´s true).....I love ALIEN, ALIENS and i really like ALIEN III.....The story is inspired, the effects are AMAZING, the actors are perfect and the main character, the ALIEN beast is the coolest alien EVER(but the PREDATOR is really cool too)....ALIENS is even better than the first classic one, with way more action and better effects....man, if you like space movies and alien stuff, this ALIEN trilogy is TOTALLY, COMPLETELY RECOMMENDED!!!! I saw this classic more than 30 times, and i still think i will see more....Yes, it´s that great!!!! WELL DONE, ALIEN!!!! a, see the first movie first to understand all the story!!!!BRAVO!!!BRAVO!!!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This is an incredible group. Their music combines classical with modern pop and ends up with a wonderful product. A great buy.
B000002IMG|5.0|THE NEW ORDER is one of the best albums from the great THRASH band TESTAMENT!!!!! it´s way way better produced than their raw debut THE LEGACY....if you like the old METALLICA, i totally recommend THE NEW ORDER, SOULS OF BLACK and PRACTICE WHAT YOU PREACH from TESTAMENT!!!!!!!
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|Interesting and sad to o but most people will like it. You never want to put it down it hooks you in
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|my kids and I had a blast playing this over the weekend. fun but not too challenging. I think its hello not pudding. damn trademarks.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay was good but sad<br />I would have liked to know more about what happens later... otherwise it is a great book
B0042L78MG|4.0|What enormous fun! I first heard of Caro Emerald on NPR and liked her sound so much that I bought this CD. I just can't sit still when I hear Caro Emerald's \\"That Man\\" and \\"Back It Up.\\" That big band/swing sound and great melodies make me want to move. I keep playing them again and again and smiling. (I can understand why another reviewer's title is \\"Back it up and do it again and again and again.\\" :) Even when I'm not playing them, they're going through my head (in a very pleasant way). Although Caro Emerald sings solo, there's an element of the Puppini Sisters and Andrews Sisters in her sound. The only reason why I'm giving this only four stars is that I'm not nearly as fond of the other songs on this CD.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The love, the suspension. How they finally came to terms with their love for one another. And all grindstone night encounter.
0062238868|5.0|I always enjoy reading the negative reviews. Most of them talk about how the book talks a lot about fighting and unnecessary things and blah blah blah. If you don't want to read a book about a great American hero and total bad-ass, than don't buy this book. I expected the book to be great and right up my alley. Well it sure was. Does it talk about fighting? Yes. Killing? Yes. Love and family? Yes. People need to wake up to reality and realize what this man went through and how truly amazing of a person he is and without his service and others in his position, none of us civilians would be able to have the freedom we do. Bottom line: THE BOOK WA GREAT!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I was highly entertained from the beginning. It was challenging but not so much where you get stuck for days on it. I even jumped a couple times on a couple parts. Loved it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Everyone said how great the first book was, but that it slowed down with Catching Fire and Mockingjay.  I completely disagree.  The latter two books were deeper and more suspenseful from a plot line perspective.
B002BJGYTY|5.0|this is a really good show. it is a great addition to my collection. great for the whole family. wonderful storylines and great cast. i give it five stars. LOVE IT
B009RX85N0|4.0|Good product but video does have a couple of skips. I cleaned hem and it helped but as for the series. It rocks!
B00004UEDQ|5.0|this is a really good movie. for me one of her best works. it actually has a really great story line. LOVE IT
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Whether you like SF or not, you must read this book.  The author's writing transcends SF genre and is written so simple and eloquently, it is pure poetry on paper.  Plot, believability, character development, mystery and suspense.  This book has it all.  There is also the prequel written after wool, but I didn't like that nearly as much as Wool Omnibus.
B007V4530A|4.0|Enjoyed the book and it had some helpful pointers.<br />Very helpful in the way it explained giving an informal talk
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This story is close to my heart because I had a cousin that was abducted and her remains were found three years later. My cousin's abductors was never brought to justice. I wish I knew the whole truth.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This was an interesting and enjoyable read, written well. I couldn't put my kindle down while reading and felt connected to the storyline.
B0033QC0WE|4.0|I have always loved Beethoven - was a classical musician in my youth and actually played several of his symphonies. It's very difficult to find a complete set of the symphonies where all of them are wonderful but this one comes close. And at a budget price, it's a really good deal.<br /><br />Period instrument performances can be very revealing.  The orchestra itself is tuned at a lower pitch than with modern instruments and the overall sound is less \\"brilliant\\", but with the smaller-size period instrument orchestra there is more clarity among the string sections and a better \\"blend\\" with woodwinds and brass.<br /><br />Gardiner's vision of Beethoven brings him to life a way much different from modern orchestras.  Beethoven's writing can be quite dense, but you can hear everything that's going on with Gardiner.  The orchestra is technically adept - you can hear how Beethoven circulates particular themes to strings, woodwinds, brass while hearing the architectural underpinning for the these melodies and rhythms simultaneously.<br /><br />I bought the Gardiner set after hearing the \\"Eroica\\" on the radio.  My benchmark Eroica is a live performance by Arturo Toscanini and the New York Philharmonic from 1953, but Gardiner came very close to this benchmark.  One thing in common with Toscanini and Gardiner:  fast tempos, supposedly representative of Beethoven's metronome markings.  Fast tempos, if played properly, provide great clarity, while \\"slower\\" tempos can seem drawn-out and almost lethargic. There's a difference between a too-fast tempo which sounds rushed, and one that is just moves along briskly.  I didn't feel that I was being rushed by Gardiner, but rather I was swept along with the music.<br /><br />I am particularly fond of Gardiner's vision for the 7th symphony.  There is something almost uncivilized, actually primal,  in this piece, especially in the first movement, and Gardiner nails it. In fact, I was sitting on the edge of my chair for the entire performance.<br /><br />I would never stop listening to modern orchestra Beethoven symphonies: Kleiber, Szell, Solti, Barenboim, Toscanini are among my favorites; however, I don't believe that there is only one way to interpret Beethoven. I'm able to enjoy both period and modern instrument Beethoven, and you should be able to as well.<br /><br />PS  Sound reproduction is quite good.  My entry-level audiophile music system is very unforgiving to poorly recorded discs and these sounded great.<br /><br />x
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I was able to use it at the market which was great. The number size is just right no eye strain. here.
B00AU15HPC|4.0|The BUT.... is what the heck did they ever put a remix on this cd for tracks 14 and 15? I love Justin's singing.<br />With few exceptions I enjoy every song he sings on his solo releases. This latest is his BEST by far. BUT the remix<br />tracks are boring and kind of ruin the end of the album. Why they were put there I don't understand. The other songs are very enjoyable and in the tradition of Justin. Very happy he recorded this album.
0740748475|5.0|Reading the comics again for the second time and they never get old! This will be a great way for my children to read Calvin and Hobbes, the books are very well bound and the water colors are great!
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I like it. I forget alot. This reminds me about everything. Keeps my wife off my @$$. Good work guys
B000A59PMO|5.0|I love this show.  The cast and the writing, particularly the first season, were very entertaining.  Bought all seasons on dvd and re-watch them often.  I sincerely hope they get the movie financed via kickstarter:  [...]
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the funniest game ever I always play it and everyone should to they will love it I love the Rome one a lot I have all of the subway surfures
B00B0NDF26|4.0|I'm not sure what it is about this album but their sound really reminds me of music from the 80s.  It's a bit of a departure from their previous sound but I feel it's an excellent album overall.  Would probably only pick one or two songs out of the set that I didn't care for but otherwise it's great.
B003B02PF4|4.0|Excellent story. I  like his books a lot. This one takes you across the world. Very interesting book. The ending was a b8
B00AH34AUQ|3.0|Of the recent trilogy of albums this is perhaps the weakest, my favorite being Dos.  While their sound has been pretty consistant throughout their career and this is no exception, my problem with it is the number of slower songs.  I much more prefer their songs with faster beats, and this one is somewhat lacking in that department.  Still a worthwhile album to have to complete the trilogy and for a handful of really excellent songs.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This book was really great and a pleasing sequel to the series.<br />SPOILERS<br />You were warned. If you keep reading and have not read the book you will regret it. I was really happy with the ending, and it was realistic how many people close to katniss died, unlike other books. Although, if you think realistically, peeta and katniss should have died in the first book.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is a great book with good details and a gentle flow. I never really get into his first series Percy Jackson but I read the first book so I know all the characters. This would be a good book for people that like Greek and Roman mythology like me. I learned a lot of new myths and legends about fascinating creatures and gods that I've never heard of. I never knew who Nike was until I read this series. So read this series and be fascinated!
B000002GYG|5.0|I would definitely recommend this to anyone who is a fan of the great Tom Waits. No one tells a story like he does, and no one can deliver a line the same way. It's humorous, entertaining, and a great listen. More than worth the small amount paid. To sum it up: Buy This!
B00884GR0W|1.0|I can't even get past the first level  also it's impossible to control. Lastly the graphics are horrible don't waste it money on this
030758836X|4.0|Gillian Flynn's third novel features all of the masterful storytelling and psychological intrigue that readers of her first (very good) two novels have come to expect--yet in \\"Gone Girl,\\" she has outdone herself.<br /><br />This novel combines all of the inherent drama of a \\"wife-disappears-and-husband-is-immediately-suspected\\" tale, but Flynn takes that hackneyed formula and turns it on its head. She does this primarily by creating two characters/narrators who simply cannot be trusted to tell the truth--and that premise informs the entire narrative because, even though this novel ostensibly tells the story of a married couple who slowly begin to discover that they don't know each other nearly as well as they think they do, it also tells the story of cultural narratives and the power they have to influence our behavior and guide our beliefs.<br /><br />Cable news channels and the Internet have spawned an endless parade of these cultural narratives--with the \\"vanished spouse\\" among the more popular ones--and Flynn uses the power of these narratives to demonstrate the alarming degree to which they have come to shape our perceptions of each other.<br /><br />I won't say much more about the plot details--doing so would deprive you of the sense of intrigue and sheer fun you will have in reading this book. I'll simply say that Gillian Flynn is a novelist who will appeal to your intellect, tell a great story, and compel you to consider just how well we know the people we believe we love.
0062014536|3.0|Book start okay but not as good as the other two. The ending sucked it just ends without really telling what happens. It could of been a way better book.
B007KOLNXC|5.0|One of the best shows ever on television.  Perfectly acted, beautifully filmed and incredibly costumed, it brings back an era of which I was a part in a way that is both nostalgic and appropriately critical. Kudos.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This was probably one of my best games! And this game is very edicting so BUY IT.<br />And I promise that anybody who buys this will like it!!!
B009ZQC7MY|1.0|I am very upset. I thought I was buying a DVD of the third season. Instead I got<br />a video to be watched on my PC. There should be a way to cancel your order<br />when an error like this is made. I woulds like to cancel this order if an way<br />possible. I want a DVD of the 3rd season. but it looks like I an stuck with a<br />$19.99 charge for something I don't want. Is there any way credit this $19.99 charge<br />towards a DVD of the 3rd season ?
1451695195|5.0|Great Read!  This book was recommended to me by a friend, because I read everything that has to do with the afterlife and what happens when we die.  I would highly recommend this book to anyone intersted in this subject area.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Great through producer and an excellent movie drama  Facts a bit off to &#34;enhance&#34; the story, keeps you on edge of seat.  Was a good discussion with family of what happened 30+ years ago,  brought back many feeling of being in gulf (Navy) myself as Russians invaded Afghanistan and our attempt at hostage rescue failed.  It was all scary as the movie portray
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Thought the movie was just ok. I thought it would be better, but some of the stuff was just plain stupid. Would not watch again or tell a friend to rent it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This series is phenomenal. It just gets better and better. This season 3 is the best yet. I highly recommend it!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This app is very easy to play. Always works. love it! Options allow different play modes. multiplayer seems very interesting.
B00AFEXRME|4.0|This movie wasn't what I expected but I liked it anyway. It is a good portrait of an alcoholic in denial. Denzel Washington was wonderful, as  usual. I recommend it. The flight scenes are scary and then yo realize that if he hadn't been inebriated, the passengers wouldn't have survived. Egad!
B006KX3GXO|4.0|I wanted a nice photo editor.  And I got just that. But what was unique was that its a network. And it has posts and followers. I didn't really think I like that. But the photo editing was good.
B00454U1NS|5.0|I wasn't always a huge fan of P!ink but after I saw her perform &#34;Try&#34; on an awards show, I was hooked! Too bad &#34;Try&#34; isn't on this disk but I'm happy all the same! &#34;Raise your Glass&#34; &#34;Sober&#34; and &#34;*Perfect&#34; are my favorites!
B005PTYP70|5.0|Loved all the MI movies. Will be great to watch while on rv vacation with my daughter.  Got it on time, in new condition.
B00140GXLU|2.0|It did not come with a cd case.  It had poor sound quality and I think it had something to do with the foreign language written on its cover.  For the price it was at I guess it was barely okay.  I hope this helps the reader because I wish someone would have told me this stuff.
B00B49L7JY|5.0|I loved this movie! Rodriguez is absolutely amazing! Fantastic songs, fantastic movie - just extremely entertaining. Highly recommend. One of the most touching I've ever seen. And to think this is all true!
B000FC1HBY|3.0|After reading the first book in this excellent series, I found this one to be something of a chore, but only because of the standards George R.R. Martin set for himself. This is still a fine read with memorable characters, plenty of action, and of course that same superb fantasy setting no other author has ever mastered quite so well. I'm very much so looking forward to the third book.
B000P0J0D8|5.0|The movie came in a timely manner, and the CD was in perfect condition. I thought it was going to be used for the price I paid, but it was brand new! It is my best friend's favorite movie, and after I watched it with him I can see why. Awesome movie!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|A little too graphic on the sex for a 65 yr old but I just skip over some of that
B004J4WLB4|4.0|Great characters and a story that keeps you wondering.  This is a good example that family is what you make it.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|Totally get this book for lots of fun.The book is cool. Get this book. DO IT NOW! HA bye bye
B006LSZECO|4.0|What a wild ride!!!  Never could get ahead of the story ... fantastically unpredictable.  I know it's been said ad nauseam but it was (amazing).
B0070R8WY2|5.0|Sharon - I'm a 31 year old man - probably not you typical demographic, but damn I love your music and your voice.  I listen to a wide variety of mostly rock music, but something always drives me back to you.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|I can't get enough of this series. Just down loaded the third book I can't wait. I also watch the show but nothing compares to the books
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Quite possibly the best rock album of 2012.  I love these guys! Please keep rock alive and support bands like this and others who make real music.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|This is a great watch.  It keeps very good time.  As others have said, it is not the giant trendy watches that are out there today.  It is a normal sized men's watch.  The only concern I have is the 30 Meters water rating, this does only give it incidental water protection.  If you do any swimming, fishing, or go to the lake or ocean this watch may not be for your.  There is a slightly larger version (unfortunately twice the price) that is 100 Meter rated and is just as nice of a watch.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|just amazing<br />I love it so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|You need to read this book, that is all! So now go ahead and buy the book, the tell other people abouit it.
B003WWZ1R0|3.0|The music is good for Yoga, has enough variation to keep me listening.  I still wish I could preview music from this site before buying...

B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Me and my bro totally love this game please Inform me when there is a new game thanks for the game
B007EECSFA|3.0|What a tedious read!  This book started off slow and has SO many layers. I was exhausted from peeling the layers of this story. The author definitely used a large of amount of detail that the reader has to plod through to get to the plot. There were several times I put this book down and it never called me to continue. I forced myself to finish the story just to see the outcome.  The revealing of the secrets and the moments leading up to the ending saved this book for me. It just took so darn long to get there!
B003UBTX7C|5.0|I could not put this book down!  Kept me on the edge of my seat the entire book!  Love Baldacci books since The Lottery!
B002A5WQ8W|5.0|Time Out epitomizes the best aspects of everything jazz. It's got just enough pulse, just enough groove, and just enough soul to take a place next to all of the top jazz albums.
B007REV4T8|5.0|although the second movie lagged a bit with the love interest and all (you still can't deny the opening scene was absolutely awesome), javier and craig work well together.... it reminds me of the Bale Batman... Craig's Bond Trilogy is ..... the best Bond ever.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app it has realistic animations and details  I wish you would be able to give the horse , a bath and make baby horses overall average I love it
B00B7G3BUW|2.0|This sequel realy let my Son and myself down<br />Week storey, it just didn't keep up with the first movie. They must have the gore would make up for putting less thought and energy into making a sequel that's better or at least as good as the first movie. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because of my time invested.
B000FC12Z0|5.0|This is a classic Poirot mystery-suspenseful, thrilling and the result is totally unexpected. A great classic detective story from Agatha Christie.
B004P75EJQ|5.0|My Grandson is 17 and into GREAT MUSIC!  I got this for his birthday and he was so thrilled to HEAR songs as they were meant to be heard!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Just as good as the first! Couldn't put it down, on to the third book. It has to 've as good as 1 and 2.
B00005LOUP|4.0|As someone who looks forward to the original Grinch and has seen the Grinch on Broadway, I never expected to enjoy this movie as much as I have!
B000JML7EC|4.0|A great sea adventure featuring a young lad Jim Hawkins, who meets pirates on the way to a treasure hunt, a battle, and much, much more. If you want to know what happens, read Treasure Island, a great classic by Robert Louis Stevenson.
B00886XQO0|5.0|Awesome sounding head phones! sure they're a bit pricey but they're completely worth every penny! Wireless surround at its best!
B008IGP8RI|5.0|Whether you have seen the movie or not, and I do recommend it, whether you like the movie or not, this soundtrack featuring artists of the finest caliber, doing some of the most incrediblly creative interpretations of some true old time treasures, is WELL worth adding to your collection. The brilliant mind of Nick Cave strikes again! Love it!
0425263916|5.0|I read Fifty Shaded and was captivated. Then a friend recommended this series and I became even more captivated. I fell in love with Gideon immediately in Bared to You...despite all his \\"insanity\\". The more I read about him the more I became fixated on the loving/sweet side of him over his possessive/controlling side.<br /><br />This is the second book in the series and it is a lot racier and more suspenseful. Once again I couldn't put this book down once I started it. I became engorged with various emotions all over again...some good and some not so good (frustration/anger is good ones). I will admit that at times I found myself cursing at this book, especially when it came to all the insecurities Gideon and Eva still have towards one another and at all the games they continue to play. But yet I find myself feeling for them and wanting them to work through all the mess over and over again. I wished that some of their problems would finally get resolved already in this book but just when you think they are finally getting somewhere we are hit with another curveball and more bombs are dropped on us. Gotta love Ms. Day - she has a way to keep her readers on the edge of their seats waiting for a resolution that doesnt seem possible but will stick with her through thick and thin to find out!<br /><br />One thing about this series that frustrates me to no end is the fact that bad situations are always fixed with sex. SEX, SEX, SEX....if you don't like to read about it then don't even contemplate ever reading this book. There is sex on practically every page and it is described in great detail. I admit that I enjoy reading sex scenes as much as the next person but after a while I just found myself skipping over them as they became too much. After a while I was no longer turned on and found myself rolling my eyes with boredom. I mean how many times can you read about the same thing over and over again?? After the 20th time reading about it I knew what was going to happen. So, like Bared to You, bout halfway through the book I again found myself skipping right through most of the sex scenes and tried to just focus  on the rest of their torrid relationship.<br /><br />Despite my complaint about all the drawn out sex the book was a FANTASTIC read and very well written. I continue to be drawn to these characters and their love story. If you start reading something and cant put it down then you know the author did their job and did it right! I cant wait to read the final book and see where Gideon and Eva's relationship finally takes them. Despite all the \\"abuse\\" they inflect on each other, I am confident that they will get through it and have a happy ending.

B0089LOKHG|4.0|Like the first book this one was entertaining. The ended was a little predictable.  I knew we were going to end up with a love triangle.  It still left me bored in at least 2 places just like the first book did.  I mean seriously, did she really have to spend that long in the cell?  I still don't see what purpose there was in beating that poor boy up like that and the whole nearly killing Lena?  I was entertained by the book but had no problem putting it down.  I shouldn't want to put a good book down.  I won't be buying the final book in the series.  Its to predictable, I foresee a lot of emotional battles in Tally's head and I'm not interested in reading about that.  I've lost interest and I'm moving on.

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Love this game very challenging updates are cool too would recommend for people looking for a puzzling game. Its awesome
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This s a fun game to use to &#34;destress&#34; your day.  It is colorful and addictive.  Even my three year old granddaughter plays it although is sometimes is a little difficult for her, but she is learning to recognize the different tiles.
B002QUWYWE|3.0|but the play back kept going in and out of sync. overall the film is great and alot of fun but wish amazon would fix the glitches
B001AIRUP4|5.0|Talk about a great movie to get on Blu-Ray.  Wow, the sound is fantastic.. and the detail is amazing.  I must have seen this movie 20 times over the years including when it came out in the theater.  Not once did I notice that Zero has a jack-o-lantern for a nose!  And the extra of Christopher Lee reading the poem that inspired the film was super.  Well worth the upgrade (for my I was clearing out ancient VHS tapes and looking to replace some that i was fond of).
B00B1MJ02K|5.0|This is a well produced and arranged album. I like it better than the recordings from Andrea's actual live concert in Portofino. Bocelli does not over sing as some tenors do but puts just the right amount of expression into these beautiful songs. I just wish I spoke a little better Italian.
B003CRM6QO|5.0|Dude, it's Flash Gordon... on BluRay... for under $9.  What's to think about.  I had this on VHS for years, but haven't had a VCR hooked up in a long time.  The quality was great, totally loved it!  Well worth the price of a sandwich at Subway, and far more enjoyable.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Great to hear Jimmy Carter speak at the end letting people know they had to keep this secret to protect the hostages.
111846446X|4.0|Good introduction to an amazing gadget. If you want an idea what you can do with this thing buy this, it is written by one of the inventors
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love the graphics and how it works. It's really easy to play its almost like temple run.but subway surfers is way better then both temple runs!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Arrived in timely manner; in excellent condition.  I have read that season 4 is in production, so looking forward to purchasing it when released.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|It just seems to capture a time, and the resultant ancillary thoughts are pleasant. The tears of a cultural shift are encapsulated nicely.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|loved being able to watch it when i wanted to. the story is great. it was so easy to access on my amazon account.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is so fun its unbelievable. I think everybody should get this game even though its seven dollars.its just so fun everybody would like it.

B0063GORYU|5.0|I love this game. I play it when my husband is watching his crazy tv shows that I hate.  I can stay in the room without being bored
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I always wonder about my Wi-fi..  this helps me feel sfer and better when I am online.  Hope that you like it to

B00BEPVAV8|3.0|i think this game is ok. i like cars. i play this game on a kindle fire. the dude looks pretty cool
0312641893|5.0|My daughter loves fantacy/ sci fi books and while at the public library I was browsing for her and ran across this book.  I decided to read a chapter and see if I thought she would like it.  Two hours and 8 chapters later, I was completly engrossed.  I'm not a fan of fantacy/sci fi myself but I was totally mesmerized by the combination of a futuristic cyborg and the classic children's tale of Cinderella.  Fantastic book for tweens who love to read, and moms who like to share!
B00007LTIA|5.0|This album is probably the most influential single piece of music I have ever heard. Call it what you will, insult it, call it prog rock, keep Yes out of the Hall of Fame, and all of that other nonsense, but none of that changes my opinion of this album. I first heard it on a strange quadrophonic 8-Track my sister bought not long after it came out that was like $30.00 bucks at the time. And we had a quad system at home. It was like the surround sound of today, of course accompanied by a bit of hiss and the clicking from track to track. I was already a huge Yes fan having seen the Yessongs tour at age 12. But me and my friends understood this music and listened to it continually. And we weren't nerds either. I was a jock who liked to party but this music literally changed me into a much deeper person even at that young age. Hardly cared that others didn't get it because it spoke directly to me and still does today. This isn't music for everyone and that's the great part about it. And I know when I meet someone who understands this album that I have met someone of real substance.<br /><br />Great guitar pieces (some of Howe's best work here), bass lines (nobody does it like Squire) and a thunderous piece by Alan White using various percussive instruments that you cannot merely describe as a drum solo. We used to crank that part up and drive slowly down the beach at night, almost a spiritual experience. White and Squire just locked right in with each other as this was White's first album with Yes. And Wakeman does his part quite adequately as the worlds greatest keyboardist.<br /><br />And of course I can't forget Jon. The master of positivity and spirituality. Whatever the guy has found in life it is magical. This album (especially on Nous Sommes and Ritual) showcases his tremendous skills.<br /><br />Comparing this to the music of today is like comparing Mozart to Justin Bieber. There is simply no comparison to anything I have heard and there is some quite good musicout there. This album is just very unique. I suppose unique enough to set the often cranky Wakeman off in a bad moment. But we still love ya Rick!
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this is a fun and exciting game if you get it i bet you'll have fun to i hope you get this app. ?-)
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|Some background on me: it's been nearly 40 years since the first time I read The Hobbit. The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings are my two favorite novels of all time. I own paperback versions that are so old the covers are torn. I own newer versions and I bought the kindle versions. Okay, I'm a little crazy about these books.<br /><br />I went to see An Unexpected Journey with mild trepidation. I had read some of the professional reviews. My brother saw it before I did and said \\"It dragged.\\" But it was Peter Jackson, the man who brought LOTR to life so well. And I'd bought the tickets for my 17-year daughter and I to see the IMAX 3D version. So we went. And we loved it.<br /><br />Can I ask a silly question? What's wrong with a story taking its time to tell it's tale? One can hardly claim that \\"An Unexpected Journey\\" doesn't have action, it certainly does and plenty of it. Orcs and goblins fighting with dwarves, not to mention trolls and giants. But the story isn't afraid to breathe, to draw things out a little, to let us gaze in wonder while we contemplate the wonders that Peter Jackson & crew have bestowed upon us. My favorite moment: gliding on the wings of eagles through the Misty Mountains. I'd pictured that moment when I first read the book, almost 4 decades ago. And Jackson captured it perfectly. Have we been so inundated with movies like \\"Transformers\\" with so much action and so little plot that we all have ADHD when it comes to watching a movie? (and for the record, I didn't care for the Transformers).<br /><br />It's a fair point that \\"An Unexpected Journey\\" is not completely faithful to the source material. There's a lot of added material and most of it Jackson made up on his own. But he did that with LOTR and I don't see people whining about it (now). And for the most part, the changes made work. If pressed I'd have to say that I wish the troll scene was more like the book.<br /><br />Maybe it's not your cup of tea (or pipe-weed to smoke). But for this Hobbit fan, I was enthralled. I can't wait for The Desolation of Smaug! And my daughter absolutely adores Richard Armitage. My only conundrum: buy the theatrical version now or wait for the extended edition? That's a tough one. No, WB, I'm not buying both. I'm leaning towards the theatrical version because although the deleted scenes might be interesting, this isn't the LOTR where I'm hoping to see scenes cut from the movie that were in the book like Galadriel's gifts to the Fellowship.<br /><br />Update - conundrum solved! Thank you DirecTV and Pay Per View! I recorded \\"An Unexpected Journey\\" off pay per view and burned to a DVD. And at $4.99 I can justify getting the 'extended edition' in the fall. Hooray! Now I'm off to blunt the knives and break the plates! :^)
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it's so fun I don't stop playing. I wish I had more coins and plus I'm trying to get all the bonuses.<br /><br />..
B004XUMMFE|4.0|Fan of the movie Serenity.  Found firefly series on Kindle.  Enjoyed seeing characters again and getting the full history of the crew. Too bad series was not continued.  These were very likeable characters
B0051QIGP4|5.0|Before this album was released, Lady GaGa said that this album would be alot different than the others she had previously put out. Something i was a bit scared about. I (we & you) love our pop diva. But i knew no matter what this album would be good and it was. The album has such a wide range of styles and i really enjoyed it.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|I read this book years ago and found  the lessons within inspiring and enlightening. That was why I couldn't resist when I found this copy available on the kindle. It teaches you how to determine true wealth in yourself and others and personally made me realize that I'm much better off financially than a number of my flashier peers. Thank you for the encouragement and inspiration.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|Wish it was a longer book and more detailed. It was definitely a good read but I feel it was rushed through.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Quite a bit different from the film, but I really enjoyed the book more. Deeper character development and more of a plot made for a better story. The relationship between the parents was explored more in the book.  I recommend reading the book before seeing the film.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I like this game it is so cool!  I love the option to take pictures.  I also love to play with the horses.
B0095P31L6|5.0|I started this movie for my grandson to watch. He had to go - so I was going to stop it and watch it later with him. I couldn't stop it. I couldn't wait to see what was going to happen next. This lasted all the way through the movie. When it was over I wanted more! Way Cool Mr. Rango!
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|You will not be disappointed in this wonderful story. Achingly sad and laugh out loud funny at the same time.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|I am so absorbed in these books. I am happy that there is another book to follow this one! The ending was a shock a great shock! I can't wait to read the next book!
B00AN0KGWE|4.0|My husband and I watched all 10 episodes last Saturday. We enjoyed it but thought it was not quite as entertaining  as the first season. Still plan to watch season 3 because we love the show.

B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I am going to tell you why I do like school I like school because I love taking a lot of testing and I love it if you don't  I will give you reasons why you should love testing from teachers. Reason number one it will help you so when you go on to middle school you will know this stuff when you go to middle school. Do you want to know more about why you should like school. Number two you will be smarter than a seventh grater which is good. Number three because you know your multiplication . So those are my three reasons why so have I convinced you yet well I hope I did well if I did good cause I love school.

B00B23O96A|5.0|Not sure why so many reviewers are having a problem with this album. No, its not Clapton \\"guitar god\\", but as a Clapton fan, i appreciate that all of his recordings have a different style. Its true that lately all the classic rockers feel a need to put out one of these cover albums. But if your in the mood for more of a mellow album to listen to in the car, this is a good one. I especially like ECs version of the late, great Gary Moores Still got the blues. If your an EC fan ,check it out, youll like it.

B007IK44CK|5.0|Great Movie. Lots of action and Worth your time to watch.  Tom Cruise did a great job handing the series off for future MI ovies.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Not so much a hidden object game as it is a puzzle game.  You have to find tools and keys and such then figure out how to use them.  It took me a morning to plow through it.  There are hints if you get stuck.  All in all, I enjoyed it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it I never get caught every time I get caught it is every 10 minutes I have a lot of coins.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Our family loved the TV show, watched our VCR tapes over and over, we are so happy with these remastered DVDs.  Basil, Sybil, Polly and Manuel are some of our favorite characters.
B0086700CM|5.0|fun game. cant believe I hve to write a review for a game. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B002ZG981E|5.0|This is absolutley one of my favorite movies. It keeps you thinking. This is one of those that you can watch multiple times and see something new you didn't pay attention too the previous time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|fun game. cant believe I hve to write a review for a game. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B0058YPGSY|4.0|The DVD's were great but the case does not hold the outside cover and taping it didn't work.  Since we are keeping these it was a disappointment.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|fun game. cant believe I hve to write a review for a game. blah blah blah blah blah blah blah
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Very easy read and your typical Nicholas Sparks book.  Love them all.  He is one of my favorite authors.  Can't wait to see the movie now.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love any book about our amazing, loving, caring, forgiving, awesome God.  My cousin bought it so I haven't got a chance to read it yet but she likes it a lot.
B00BP4X3W2|5.0|Excelent movie , shows the reality of the Jews and how Oskar save some . Recomended .... God Bless you .
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is my go to weather app. I have tried others in the past but this is the best so far. I like the ability to see hourly as well as daily and it's been pretty accurate. If you need a weather app get this one.
B004W1GCQO|3.0|Compared to downton, this is terrible.<br /><br />Compared to the original upstairs downstairs - this is terrible.<br /><br />BUT, compared to most of the reality junk on TV today, this is GREAT!  ha ha ha.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Enjoyed the book.  Grisham always writes well but not my favorite of his novels.  Gives you good ideas if you ever have to stay below the radar.
B007KOMTUI|5.0|It is wonderful to escape to the 1950s but it is also depressing.<br /><br />We can't stop watching madmen - the style, drama, etc. have hooked us.......it makes us appreciate the benefits of today.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was so beautiful. I cried because of how beautiful it was. I would recommend this book to anyone because men may also enjoy it. Nicholas Sparks is one talented man.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|A well written fantasy..however, I had difficulty accepting the premise...perhaps I was not the target audience.  Still it was a well written book
0486424545|3.0|just hard to get into this.....i usually like classics, and british lit also, but it was hard to keep reading this, and i gave up and donated it to a resale shop.
B0024F08RO|4.0|this season is not the best, but still maintains a solid story line.  FYI, this DVD does not have subtitles.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I really enjoyed this.  The first Phantom had a rather definitive ending which may have caused a problem for the sequel.  Other than the fact that I didn't get to look at Gerard Butler throughout the movie, I enjoyed it.  I should add that his replacement was a better singer than Mr. Butler.
0545265355|5.0|The Hunger Games are a favorite for most people. Great reading material and this was the best price I found.
B00138H0HO|5.0|As a long time fan of Jamiroquai, it's about time I actually get a copy that I 'own.'  I honestly don't don't know the extent of what I can do with the files I purchased, but I'm sure somehow, someway, that I'm already breaking the law by sharing it on my network or some bulls*** like that.    If you like Jamiroquai, or other funky jams, pick up this album.  If you're still unsure, listen to him on youtube before you commit to purchasing the album.
B008NR8YXC|5.0|I have enjoyed this Bach work for many years.  Likewise I have listened to Andras Schiff recordings for a long time.  His playing is always tasteful and he is at his best here.
B00B935SUY|5.0|Extremely entertaining and fast paced. I was lucky enough to have visited this Studio in the late 1970's. Felt very proud to know I was lucky enough to step foot in there.<br />Great work from Dave Grohl. Nice to see someone care about something so much.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I suspect some of the deals are stacked in the player's favor.  I say that because it's the only Klondike sol I've ever been able to win of a frequent basis.  Semi-addictive - I really enjoy playing when I have a few minutes to kill.
0385486804|5.0|For me the best stories are true stories that are so interesting they read like fiction, and Jon Krakauer has that talent. If you read \\"Into thin air\\" you know what I mean. He has done it again with \\"Into the Wild\\" Just a really good read that is all the more intriguing because it really happened. I think at some point in life everyone has a secret fantasy of what it would be like to just disappear and start a new life, This is the story of someone who took it from fantasy to reality and paid the ultimate price for that freedom.  Its really hard for me to understand how this book can get a bad review, but I guess no matter what you do you can't please everyone. Personally I think you could do a lot worse if you are looking for a book that will captivate your imagination, and leave you with something to think about.
B00942X8PY|3.0|A rather different type of game - at least for me.  Good but not great, not addictive.  Worth taking a look.
0375826742|5.0|cant wait to read it book one and two where so good!!! Highly recommended to anyone that has read book one and two *WARNING* do not read these before the others you will be so lost as it picks up where the other story ended.
0670026603|5.0|I thought this book was very entertaining and a great read.  I loved envy thing about it and stayed up way past my bedtime a couple of nights because it was so enthralling. Make certain you have tissues handy the last 30 pages but beyond that the ending made you feel that all was resolved and life goes on.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Jurassic park since the first airing of the first movie. If you ever liked Jurassic park than this is for you!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|I don't know what everyones crying about the more the Merry'-er. I personally own the original trilogy both the theatrical and extended versions on DVD and Blu-Ray giving the fact that the theatrical and extended versions both have completely different special features makes both versions well worth having so therefor I will most definatly be bying both the theatrical and extended versions on Blu-Ray just because they both will be having different special features and their own individual flavor added to them so if you are in fact a real LOTR's fan, stop crying and complaining about them first releasing the Theatrical then re-releasing the Extended version, this is because Peter wanted it this way and for all the Sacrifice and Passion that Sir Peter and his fantasic team endured making these magnificent Master pieces these are a great buy and a well worth added addition to an already \\"Precious\\" collection and if you do remember..the extended editions were an idea that Peter came up with to release to the audiance all the fantastic scenes that didn't make the final cut not scenes he didn't want or deleted he said just scenes that made the movie too long, so I say to all of you LOTR fans \\"The more the Merrier\\"!!!......:So stop your fretting, master dwarves:......*
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Even though neither my husband or I was particularly interested in surfing, it didn't affect the enjoyment of this movie. It was a great family movie, no cussing, no objectionable scenes, and full of lots of excitement and adventure. The story line had so many great points and there were some great funny parts too. Even though parts of it were very sad, it was still a great movie. Would defintely recommend it to anyone who likes a good, clean, exciting movie.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|If you're looking for a new show to get into, you found it!....Im not one for buying DVDs but this is my favorite show. Supper funny!
0307120007|5.0|This book is great for babies and toddlers. It has a catchy story, is fun to interact with each page and creates great interactions between the parent and child. Love this as a baby shower or 1st birthday gift.
B000W91RUG|5.0|If you're looking for a new show to get into, you found it!....Im not one for buying DVDs but this is my favorite show. Supper funny!
B00APJLEGA|5.0|My 4 kids watch this movie over and over and over!  Even mom and dad think it is a cute movie!

B006OE7XM4|5.0|I purchased Be Good because a friend said it was a fabulous. I  never find any current music that moves me, so I set very low expectations.  I was thoroughly impressed by Gregory Porter's most recent CD!  This is real music, timeless music; music that makes you smile, think, dance, sing and cry.  I absolutely cherish this CD.
B008PNBU30|5.0|So sad this is the last album with Adam as the lead singer. It showed up on time in great condition and it was nice to be able to download this album off Amazon while I waited.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It's a simple and easy to use game, which is exactly what I wanted. I have nothing to complain about.
B00000J6AG|3.0|I just love Moby and his odd artistic spin on music.  This CD takes me back and I love listening to it.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|I loved this book.  It had alot of twists and very suspensful.  I usually prefer romance novels but this book was a nice change of pace. Highly recommend it!
B003N1I3SO|5.0|Such a great artist! Love all the songs on the CD, and that's rare for me. I would highly recommend it. For those of you who don't understand a word of French, I still think you would enjoy this. It is a different listening experience when you understand the message behind the lyrics, but that can mostly be made up for with translated lyrics.
6304078102|5.0|We moved and misplaced our copy of Mr. Holland's Opus,,,movie is so touching. My husband swears it was made about his band teacher from high school days.  Thanks
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I'm a sucker for period dramas. I watched this one a couple of years ago for the first time on Netflix and watched it three more times the following year. When it went off Netflix Instant Play, I knew I had to buy it. More expensive than other dvds, but worth it. If you're a history person like me, I think it was an accurate portrayal of the working and social conditions of industrialized cities. The characters and storyline are interesting and engaging. Overall, it's a great drama.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Just built a gaming rig with this. It is perfect.<br />Very fast, very stable.<br />Also, doesn't heat up a lot if you buy an after market cooler.<br />Never have I made a purchase for a processor, this expensive, but it is worth the price.<br />I would recommend to any one who wants to do some serious gaming.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I just love playing solitare, so thought that I would get this for the plane ride on my upcoming trip.  It is really fun.
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Bizarre and difficult to follow.  Forget it and play cards instead.  The story was told without heart or interest, characters were flat and the dialog was a bore.  Stylized to death.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I hesitated about reading this trilogy for a long time. I'm glad I did read it, after all. It is not for everyone. It is gritty. It is real (even though set in a future dystopia, it is in some ways more real than many stories set in our present day). It is almost like non-fiction. It is a story of a war survivor. No pretty happily-ever-after endings here, just the bitter truth. And as another reviewer has said, it will leave you emotionally drained. But not to read it would be to miss not only one of the best stories of our time, of all time, but a meeting with the side of humanity no one wants to know or think about, but everyone should.<br /><br />I give this one 5 stars, but that probably means that I will have to go back and downgrade my other well-reviewed books to 1-2 stars at best.
0061950726|4.0|THE ORPHAN TRAIN is one of those books you don't want to end.  You want it to continue so you can find out even more about the entwined lives of seventeen year old Molly Ayers, Vivian Daly, as well as Jack and his mother Terry Gallant.  Eighty two years earlier an unfortunate set of circumstances had placed a nine year old Vivian on the train that would take her from New York City to the plains of Minnesota as one of the more than two hundred thousand children transported to new, and not always better, lives via the Orphan Trains.<br /><br />Now, fate has once again intervened in the lives of both women as at age 91 Vivian meets Molly, the intelligent but somewhat troubled young woman of Indian heritage living with foster parents who appear to be \\"in it for the money\\".  As part of a community service assignment, Molly begins to assist Vivian in cleaning out her attic, slowly sorting through the mementos that represent the pieces of Vivian's life she has kept hidden for all these years.  As they discover the unexpected correlation in their life experiences and Molly and Vivian develop a true affection for each other.<br /><br />As the story moves back and forth in time between the late 1920's and present day Maine author Christina Baker Kline's novel explores the subjects of love, adversity, resilience, providence, the workings of the child welfare system, deep and hidden secrets, and how the choices we make can resonate through generations.<br /><br />As you discover more and more about these characters and their lives, you may certainly question some of their behavior and the decisions they made. While you may not agree with nor understand their actions, they remain endearing folks who stick to your heart like glue so that find yourself accepting their flaws and wishing them well.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|great long term fun. worth a couple bucks to pass time like this. several modes,  I play to fill whole screenwith one object
B00555X8OA|4.0|A little boring at times with the experiments detailed similarly in each chapter, this book plainly will help you understand your thinking and decision-making better. If you've read Nudge, you simply must read this book as it explains the nuts and bolts.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|Not entertaining at all.  Couldn't save games.  There was absolutely no point. I deleted it within a day! Don't waste your time.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Beautiful Darkness was every bit as captivating as Beautiful Creatures.  I couldn't put it down. The characters keep you on your toes!
B00594XOZU|5.0|Easy to use and start up works just like other messaging apps already have used it to contact others that I told to use
B009EEFTMC|4.0|This game is easy, fast paces and fun...for a while. There are 2 modes, regular (where you just match all the cubes until they are gone) and attack mode (where you start with 2 pairs and they give you 2 more pairs every 2 seconds whether you've matched the others or not). They are both fun....but that's all there is, which is why I gave it 4 stars instead of 5. My young kids and I enjoy taking turns and it's a easy way to pass 5 minutes.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game!! The horses look so realistic and the controls are perfect, so seamless. The only thing I would want added is more mini games. Other than that it's perfect! I really do enjoy playing it so much! And my kids also like it!! Lol.
B00280LYIC|4.0|One of the better books I read lots of action and adventure I like the book steady story line good book I recommend
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been doing this video for years now and am still enjoying my results from the workout.  It is only 25 minutes, so it allows me to fit a workout in 3-4 days a week.  I get much better results from the video vs running outside, which is what I used to do.  Mixing the 2 together in the summer works great for me.  You can't go wrong with this video. I have all of my neighbors doing her videos as well!
0810996596|5.0|I ordered this for my husband for Christmas after he mentioned a few times that he wanted it., (huge Kirk Hammett and horror movie fan). His jaw dropped when he opened it and he immediately started looking through it. Needless to say, I lost my husband for the next two hours. The pictures are amazing and the book is very well made.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Liked this book and LOVEt this series. Like the tone and meter of the writing...and,well, the over all creepiness. Ethan and Lena are a little too much for me,at times,and the descriptions can get a little tedious...however,Beautiful Darkness is a good, satisfying read. 4 stars
B008NMT684|5.0|My Grandson is very good at puzzles at age 3 and he loves this game so much.  looking for more like this one.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Amazing story and beautifully written.<br />The series can only get better from here, George R.R Martin's genius is apparent in this plot
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|It is a really good game but it gives you so little time to ride the  car and it's so hard to steer sometimes.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this so much!!!!!!!! Its amazing, i love the horses, and how you can train them! I would recommend this app for kids! Considering i am one! Haha! 14 is considered a kid right?
1616550414|4.0|It is a great buy for any fan of the Zelda series and should be a must own for any fan
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Completely heartwarming and genuine. Makes you appreciate the little things life has to offer<br />I'll definitely be reading this book again.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|Fun and interesting my son enjoys it, but can't get far because while u can connect w Facebook friends they can only help through a mobile app! Research can not be completed without friends and he has no friends. Would be a 5 star game if was a Facebook app and friends could help
B004EPYZUS|1.0|It drives my husband crazy, but I rarely will walk away from a movie before it's over, even when we both agree that it's bad.  This is one of those rare cases.  The movie had all the formulaic ingredients for over the top action and excitement, and I don't mind if a plot is stereotypical as long as it is well done, but it just did not engage me at all - I could not feel anything for any of the characters.  We didn't even make it to the obviously impending sandstorm when I turned to my husband & said 'I can't believe it but I don't even care what happens next'.  He agreed & we turned it off & decided to re-watch something else.  I barely even remember any details of the plot.  What a sad waste of a whole lot of money and top actors and time...
B0063IH60K|5.0|Everything I want in the game, except the ads for christian dating sites. I particularly appreciate horizontal play and touch maneuvers.
1449410243|1.0|Book is nothing but an over-priced bunch of stale cartoons with dull humor. Bought it based on the write-up and some reviews but found it totally disappointing. Save your money. There is far better cat humor out there.
B009VB9VKY|1.0|I should have read the &#34;one star&#34; reviews before renting this movie.  I'm disappointed these talented actors agreed to be in this movie.  It was awful.  Weak story and very long movie.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Plot was wonderful revelation of a broad sweep of history and the various impacts of event in various societies, with fine characterizations of principal characters.
B00005JPD0|3.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Deja Vu\\" starring Denzel Washington. The highlights of the movie were some really spectacular explosions. How do they ever do it? The destruction was awesome with mayhem, dead bodies and wreckage everywhere. Making movies like this must cost a fortune. In any case, Denzel Washington was a chief investigator whose task was to go back into the past, with the aid of a hocus-pocus machine, and study the event and how it came about. Well, I have a problem with this. Traveling back and forth through time is an imaginative concept, to be sure, but there is not even the faintest evidence that this has ever happened or ever will. My mind is simply unable to cope with such a happening and any story in which time travel is an important part is impossible for me to watch. I don't mean to be hostile. It's just the way I'm wired. I'm somewhat in envy of people who can relax and enjoy this type of thing.<br /><br />Well, the movie had a nice brisk pace to the drivel and was well directed. The acting was rather good and Val Kilmer was especially fun to watch. The special effects were spectacular to say the least and the movie used up a load of really expensive equipment. It's an action-adventure story that may be enjoyed by many. I'm just not one of them. To me, I could hardly wait for the movie to end and the story was so bad that I seriously considered not even writing a review, and reviewing is one of my major hobbies. But, that's just me. Have fun and enjoy your trip.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run two Is really fun. I play it once in a while when I'm tired and want to relax or I'm bored. Way better than brave run or temple run 1.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Insomnia\\" Starring Al Pacino and Robin Williams. It was a police movie, sort of, but the main policeman was Al Pacino, a Los Angeles homicide detective on leave and investigating a murder case in small-town Alaska. The real star of the movie was Alaska. Man, that's a beautiful state and the scenery was excellent! In any case, a young woman was murdered and Pacino was on the perplexing case and was getting nowhere fast. Ultimately, he found a suspect, Robin Williams, and in the chase ended up shooting and killing his own partner. The shooting was not intentional, of course, and he tried to cover it up. Big mistake. The killer suspect had witnessed him doing it and used the info as leverage to keep his own unintentional murder out of the spotlight. Let's just say that the case gets somewhat complicated. Much more complicated than this. Too complicated, in my opinion. It becomes surrealistic. Oh, and the whole matter was further complicated by the high summer season with bright sunlight around the clock and a debilitating case of insomnia suffered by a dreary Pacino. Well, personally, I've been in Fairbanks, Alaska, during the all-day season and I think the movie greatly exaggerated the effects.<br /><br />The acting was quite good by the entire cast, but Pacino stood out. No surprise there. Williams did a good job, but paled next to Pacino, unfortunately. The directing and filming was first rate. I was not overly impressed with quality of the story. I'd rank it as an excellent movie and well worth watching, but it wasn't quite up there with the best.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I really felt like a could connect with the characters. This is a great read for anyone. Bloody, gore, fighting, and love, this story has everything. It was an awesome series.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|This  movie does not take itself seriously, so you shouldn't take it that way either.  It uses some of the funny shots and sequences you might find in older martial arts movies, some characters speak with very modern American accents, rap music is in the soundtrack, and there is a black guy as a blacksmith living in a Chinese village.  If you don't mind any of that, you will enjoy the goofy fun and outrageous fighting and killing tactics.  RZA is not the greatest actor but he does an okay job with the direction. Russell Crowe has an amusing role as a European named Jack Knife.
B008TT7CXW|5.0|If you're a media junkie, this is the thing for you. Fits just right in the wallet, and I can turn my phone into a gigantic mp3 player/movie player on the fly. Plus it helps with sharing.<br /><br />Do it.
B009PK9SB8|4.0|This is one of the best add-ons you can purchase for your GoPro Hero 3 black edition. It works great, is easy to put on or take off, and you can turn it off when you don't need it, or back on easily when you do. It helps you frame your videos, and is very handy in reviewing them on the spot. Finally, it makes changing functions soooooo much easier. Once in a while it gets caught up, and blanks. But 98% of the time, it works flawlessly. Great product.
B008BWFOVE|5.0|When you think about prostitution, what usually comes to mind are the ladies in the street or the so-called bordellos (for rich and poor). But, in the changing world, prostitution keeps evolving due to many reasons, one being our current economies. Not everybody is competitive, and, sadly, some go into this profession as an act of desperation, curiosity, or other reasons. \\"Elles\\" is a fascinating and gripping film that explores these issues in a dramatic and intriguing way.<br /><br />Anne (Juliette Binoche) is apparently a happily-married journalist, who is writing an article about Paris' students for Elle magazine. She struggles doing chores at home, including raising a teenage son and a smaller daughter, and doing research for her book. This research involves spending time and interviewing two young college students (Joanna Kulig and Anaïs Demoustier), who, for different reasons, moonlight as prostitutes. The descriptions of their sexual duties are very graphic, and it involves several types of men - mostly married --, who have the most bizarre requests. This assignment slowly affects Anne's psyche and personal life, forcing her to make some serious decisions.<br /><br />Directed by Malgoska Szumowska, \\"Elles\\" is another movie that shows us aspects of our daily life that people are not aware of or simply ignore. Student prostitution is a sign of the times, not only in France, but in other places, including the USA. The film, as I say, is kind of graphic in the frank depiction of sex and sexual preferences, including a good dose of nudity. The Blu-ray includes edited and unedited trailers and more. (France, Poland, Germany; 2011, color, 99 min plus additional material)<br /><br />Reviewed on March 12, 2013 by Eric Gonzalez for Kino Lorber Blu-ray
034537410X|5.0|I purchased this book at a vunerable time in my life. I had never heard of Lucid dreaming but it sounded interesting when I accidently stumbled upon it so I thought'why not?\\"<br /><br />Well half way through the book I had my first lucid dream. AMAZING!<br /><br />I began writing down my dreams in the morning. Even a sentence or just a word I could remember from them at first. After a few days I started rememberng more details. I wrote them down for a week. Then I wrote a page of common links I kept seeing in my dreams (ie: rejection) It was always common. And a page of things I wanted to do if I ever became lucid. I re-read all of these things often and would say to myself outload many times a day \\" Am I dreaming?\\" If I was not, I would follow up with \\" are you sure?\\"<br /><br />So I layed in bed one night and tried the W.I.L.D technique. I started seeing vortex swirls and colours with my eyes closed but still awake. I was then thrust into a very life like dream. I asked myself if I was dreaming. I replied to myself that 'no! Of course I wasn't\\" I asked myself Are you sure? And suddenly I looked around and said \\"Oh my god, I am dreaming\\". Everything suddenly changed!!! I felt like I was not in the dream but in real life. I was lucid!!<br /><br />Immediatley as I looked around, the room I was 'standing in' fell away like it dismantled itself and the floor dropped away from under my feet. I was falling in pitch blackness and I could see a red light.<br /><br />I was yelling in my dream that I was awake, and I was so excited and then I woke up. So dissapointed but I felt euphoric for days afterwards.<br />I have only had 1 other lucid dream. I realized I was dreaming, became lucid and woke up instantly from the excitement.<br /><br />I became busy and stopped puttting in effort to write down my dreams and so I've not had another, but I'm getting back into it now and this book is definitley a 'how to' guide. I would recommend it to everyone.<br /><br />Lucid dreaming is not scary, it is an overwelming sense of joy. Good luck to all.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This novel is so beautifully crafted. It did require patience but paid off big time. Rarely have I read something as well written and absorbing.
B00632HWOG|5.0|This is my favorite way to get to my emails, and this is easy to download and use immediately.  Very user friendly.
B000002OVJ|5.0|I heard this album at a party back in the 70s. I thought it was interesting, but I thought most of the band was covered up by the bass guitar. And even though the bass guitar was incredible – almost like flamenco guitar at times - I wanted something with a more balanced sound. So I bought the Who's studio albums. Recently, I auditioned a few tracks from this live album online, and I realized that the sound is really very well balanced. Apparently, the bass was cranked up all the way on the stereo playing it back in the 70s. I generally prefer live performances (if they are recorded well) because the feeling is so great and the spontaneity of the playing is more interesting than the sanitized and overproduced albums recorded in studios. And this live album has wonderful performances! Everyone in the band is in great form.
B00514HDNW|5.0|I expected this book to be similar to the movie version, however it was different but quite enjoyable once I got in the right mind set.  It was very good.
B008MM9630|4.0|my kids love this game. they plan crops and talk bout it all the time. well worth it.<br />they play it everyday. at least they try to.
B004X75RK4|4.0|The Proposal is one of those girly, predictable romance type films but it's done well enough to make it a lot more entertaining that most others in its genre these days. The concept itself is a really intriguing idea, and the execution is well done. Then the story follows through by being more realistic than others like it. All in all, the film is entertaining and worth taking the time to watch.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie was timely and well done, and it gave more meaning to what actually happened.  We citizens never really get a feel for what our troups go through defending our country in wars.  This movie made it real and gave me a greater appreciation for our soldiers who give themselves and sometimes their life to protect and defend each of us/
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really love the series, not completely excluding this one, but I felt like the middle dragged on forever. I was really happy with the ending though.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|When I first saw this film, I recognized the two main actors from other movies I have seen.  I thought the movie was unusual and the story unique; and I loved seeing the versatility of the actors.  Most touching for me, however, was the story...people from several different background pulling together to make the group successful...and a boss who cared about the people as much as he did the product!  Bravo, England!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This was one of those books you can't put down. It is emotional and makes you feel like you are part of the story.
B005LAIHYU|5.0|What a unique combination of American history and a vampire thriller!  The movie was exciting, and the plot was surprising!  I absolutely loved it, and will enjoy watching it over and over again!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another great adventure story about John Corey and his wife tracking down the Panther. Lots of intrigue and humor. Always entertaining. A terrific read.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|I had heard about this movie when it first came out, but then it disappeared from the radar before I could go see it.  I was delighted when I saw it on Amazon, and I quickly purchased it.  I totally love this movie.  It is cute, intelligent, action-packed, and full of good clean fun!  I don't have to fast-forward past sex scenes or cringe because someone is cursing.  John Carter only curses twice...at his &#34;dog&#34; when he is trying to protect it.  I don't want to say how many times I have seen it already, but I will say that it is the movie that I watch after having a bad day or being depressed about something.  John Carter always makes me smile, and I ever tire of the story.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I have been addicted to playing Spider for years.  Now that it's available for my new Kindle, I'm in heaven.
B00005K3NY|5.0|How well I remember seeing this movie at the movie theater when I was a kid.  It was exciting and thrilling at the same time.  It was GREAT reliving those feelings and this story.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Ecellant really great read. I read all three in a week and now am looking for  more trilogies.Once I started it I could not finish it without returning to it with in seconds.
B0034G4P94|5.0|I walked in on the second half of this movie when I first saw it, and I couldn't stop watching the action.  I have an interest in MMA, but this movie presents the art of MMA rather than just showing guys beating each other up.  The story line was tremendous, and the acting was excellent.  Edgerton and Hardy became two of my favorite actors right after I saw the entire movie.  Now I will watch any movie in which they appear.  The biggest surprise for me was Nick Nolte.  I have watched him in many roles over the years with only a little interest.  He played his role in this movie, however, very well.  What a pleasant surprise that was.  This is a movie that I watch quite frequently without tiring or skipping over any of the parts.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The game is so fun. I have it on my kindle fire and my phone. I really think that people will like this game.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Loved it!! I couldn't wait to find out what happened next. I hope that there is a second book to read.
0307744434|5.0|\\"The finest of pleasures are always the unexpected ones.\\" Erin Morgenstern's quote in The Night Circus sums up my view on this book. I first bought this book as a Christmas gift for a friend, and long story short, as a result of a mix-up, I had two copies. I had read the back of the book many times, and just wasn't sure if it was something that would interest me. Eventually I decided to start reading it because I had just finished another book and couldn't decide what to read next. Wow. This book went beyond all of my expectations! I was drawn into it immediately and didn't want to put it down. This book is riveting, magical. I couldn't wait to keep reading it to find out what happened next. Every detail was described so thoroughly I could picture everything and felt like I was at the circus myself! I can't wait for Ms. Morgenstern to write another spellbinding novel!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids loved this movie and I thought it was super cute! Great Family Movie for movie night! ....  ..
0547848412|3.0|I'm kind of undecided about this book. I liked the story, and I thought it was very well written. However, it didn't seem to suck me in the way it seems to have of many other readers. I thought the story was compelling, and I wanted to keep reading it, but at the same time, I was kind of disappointed. I expected this book to completely wrap me up in the story, but it just didn't. I'm actually quite sad that this book wasn't what I thought it would be. This is not to say that it wasn't a good book, and that others shouldn't read it. I will still recommend this to others. It just isn't in my top favorites.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This story is ridiculous! Yes I enjoyed reading it, but the story is totally unbelievable. It's about two unhappy, self centered, shallow people who wish to destroy one another. All of the details in the story are too pat and quite corny. Amy's plan to hurt her husband didn't make sense. Yes, she is a sociopath, which could explain what she did,but getting away with it is unrealistic. And what about her murdering poor pathetic Desi? Was that murder even investigated? Again, it is a ridiculous story. I do however understand why this book is so popular. People love stories about sick people in sick relationships. Just look at the popularity of soap operas. This book is in that category.
B000YMM3CC|5.0|great tearjerker! I will never get tired of watching it over and over again. I wish I grew up in the 40s!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book i could not put it down i cant wait to see the movie on date night

B005QUQP76|5.0|I got this to replace a Mad Catz Cyborg RAT 7.<br /><br />That mouse simply went bad, quickly. The tracker often got locked on one axis, the scroll wheel became erratic, the software didn't always load and to enable features you'd have to open up the software.<br /><br />How does this one compare?<br /><br />-- About half the price (I got it for $32)<br /><br />-- Similar \\"skunkworks\\" design.<br /><br />-- similar scroll wheel<br /><br />-- no horizontal thumb scroll<br /><br />-- lighter<br /><br />-- better sensor. Laser.<br /><br />-- placement of buttons not quite as good as the RAT7. RAT 7 can also adjust length. This one cannot.<br /><br />It simply works. That's all I want.<br /><br />edit: okay, after some more time using it, some more things have become apparent.<br /><br />1. The weights system is pointless. There are three weights on the bottom which you can take out or leave it. However, the mouse itself is so very light even with the weights that it's pointless.<br /><br />2. Right click doesn't seem quite right. It doesn't have the same travel or something as a left click and so doesn't feel quite right. It's slightly annoying, but no big deal and something I'll eventually get used to.
B004J4WN0I|3.0|A fun and quick read.  Full of magic, fighting, and humor.  I wouldn't make room on my bookshelf for a copy, but totally worth the few bucks for a kindle download.  And I will download the next in the series.
B00B23O96A|2.0|Old sock is a fitting name to an album that sounds like one. Clapton has become an old sock. Playing old songs like just another old sentimental musician instead of giving his fans what they expect from one of the greatest blues guitar player. Save your money. He doesn't deserve it for this one.

B00AYATBP6|5.0|This is my first time reviewing any material done/written and or created by the Mastermind Steven Wilson. I came across Porcupine Tree back in 2006 and ever since then have i been glued onto this artist and anticipated each release with enthusiasm and hunger! The Raven That Refused to Sing is his 3rd solo album and its in my opinion by far his best work to date!<br /><br />The album arrived in the mail and i just knew that i was going to get my 'Prog' fix. I honestly want to say that in my opinion it is a great achievement when you first listen to an album and you are totally blown away. That is exactly what this record achieved! I want to say as a vocalist, Steven Wilson may not be as Versatile as other singers out there, but i soon discovered that Steven has never been the type of individual to come out and say, 'Hey my vocals are the S*%$!' The Musicianship is as i expected, tip top and crystal clear. The Limited Edition came with DVD audio for those audiophiles who enjoy the finer things in life :)<br /><br />What does this album do for Wilson? i want to say that it keeps him at the forefront as the strong song writer and composer that he is. I haven't had the pleasure of meeting Wilson, but i assume that he is much like his music, interesting and full of life. I know i haven't really touched on what the album is all about and or what it sounds like, but all that i can say is that it is an album of such great achievements from start to finish.<br /><br />On a final note, what i love about the album is the overall natural feeling and atmosphere that Wilson has created. Steven Wilson is a downright perfectionist and it comes across in his music and writing style. The Raven that Refused to Sing is such an incredible, strong release. All that i can hope for is that the man gets the respect and support that he so easily deserves and has worked so feverishly for.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I decided to read this trilogy after watching the Hunger Games movie.  I enjoyed the books so much that I finished all three of them in about a week. Because of the movie I have a &#34;vision&#34; of the characters of the book so I'm looking forward to more.
030758836X|3.0|There is a lot to like, if not love about Gone Girl but it bogs down in its own cleverness.  There are twists and turns that later seem to be contortions that stretch credulity.  Also, the same story told from different view points can't help but be redundant.  By all means skip 20 pages--I purposely did once just to see if it hindered my understanding--not a problem.  Also, the ending is very unsatisfying.  After trudging through the final third of the book I expected something with more bang, less whimper.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|This is a beautifully done movie that truly does justice to the epic stage play. The scenery is both beautifully understated (the convent scenes) and appropriately depressing (the opening slave scene, the dark, dirty brothels). The entire mood of the movie is perfectly appropriate and what you want to see; muted colors, grimy streets, dirty disheveled commoners. The music is glorious.<br /><br />Hugh Jackman is marvelous! Who knew he could ever look so un-handsome and sexy? Forget Wolverine, this guy is aged, weathered, gaunt, and scruffy. Jackman is not a natural tenor, and his voice strains towards the higher notes of his songs, but he hits them. A former musical actor, he's well suited to a singing role. Russell Crowe has also left his sexy young self behind, and is now the middle aged, beefy Javert, and he plays the role elegantly. However, his singing is mediocre at best. He hits the notes, but his voice is very \\"chesty\\" and not too pleasant to listen to. I'm not a big fan of Anne Hathaway, but she gave it 110% and she has a beautiful voice. I both liked and disliked her emotional butchering of \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\"; it was more realistic in some ways, but I also feel like you should just NEVER undermine that epic song. Amanda Seyfried was a believable Cosette; cute, angelic, innocent, but her quivery chipmunk-like vibrato was almost comical and detracted from her character. Eddie Redmayne as Marius... ughh... Marius is supposed to be handsome! He captures Cossette's heart with one glance. Redmayne is so unbelievable in that role; the guy is UGLY, sorry! Of course H.B. Carter has to make an appearance (seriously, she's like an STD, she's everywhere and not really wanted) as the wife of the innkeeper we all love to hate. I thought their scenes were a bit too corny. While they provide the comic relief in an otherwise dreary story, it's supposed to be understated and brief, not an obnoxious circus act, and I was disappointed in their scenes. I was also delighted tosee Colm Wilkinson as the Bishop, as he played Valjean back in the 80's! What fun that must have been for him, to play opposite \\"his\\" role in the movie. Lastly, Samantha Barks as Eponine was a natural choice, she's played the role on stage and does a lovely job.<br /><br />Note To Parents* While this film has a PG13 rating, there is some graphic violence as well as two very graphic sex scenes that honestly shocked me, as I was in the theater with my friend and her two daughters. It was like WHOOPS, didn't mean for you girls to see that! So just be forewarned.<br /><br />So overall, LOVED IT, beautifully done, with just a few critiques, mainly on the casting. Enjoy!
B0096BIENY|5.0|I love the Greatest Hits. I bought tickets to their concerts in nearby cities.<br />My only complain is that when I play the CD in my car, no names of the songs appear.

B006LSZECO|4.0|The twist was interesting. The ending was good too. Most of the book really held my attention;however, the last few chapters seemed like they had been written quickly and did not seem to complete the story. It almost seemed like 2 different people had written this book.

B00BMCLCG6|3.0|2013. 30 years of career, more than 100 million records sold, hundreds of prizes and countless live shows played - Bon Jovi are truly one of the greatest bands around the world. Time to take a rest? Not so if your name is Bon Jovi. With \\"What about Now\\" the boys from Jersey want to proof the world once again that they still do not think about retiring or taking it slow, but going on stage again and rock that world. In order to do so, they bring along twelve (if you exclude the bonus tracks) new songs, full of political criticism and stories of people that struggle in those hard times. But Bon Jovi would not be Bon Jovi if the overall message of the songs wouldn't be optimistic. No matter how hard the times are, stand up again, take that fight and go on! Why? Because We Can!<br />But can they still rock? Honestly, I have to say that I was never so torn apart with any of their records. Nevertheless I will try to write down why:<br /><br />BECAUSE WE CAN (7/10):<br /><br />I heard the song a couple of weeks ago when it was air played on German radios for the first time. And I was kind of shocked or let's say really irritated. That's the sound of Bon Jovi in 2013? The song did not convince me at all and reminded me more of a pop band than a rock band with 30 years of songwriting experiences. Really soft and way too much influenced by the Obama spirit (don't get me wrong, I like Obama a lot, but it was too much for me) - it actually sounded like Obama's political program put into a song. Bon Jovi have always been a critical and political band, but, let's say, their political attitude was never so obvious before.<br />So do I hate the song? No, not really, it changed after listening to it for a couple of times. It's still not their greatest, but if it's on the radio I don't mind listen to it and it found its way inside my head, been stuck there.<br /><br />I'M WITH YOU (9/10)<br /><br />My favorite song of the record which proves that they are still able to write good songs. The song has something to say and a really catchy melody. Of course it is also critical about the situation we are in right now, but it sounds less Obama-like and more universal. The line \\"If I got something, I got something to proof\\" shows a lot of power and immediately got stuck in my head. Sounds like the perfect song? Well yes, but there is something about this song that annoys me a lot and it's not the band's fault. The sound production is simply terrible. Listen to the line \\"look at this world it's full with worn out faces, forgotten places...\\" Can you recognize it? Well, Jon's voice does not sound like a voice that can fill out a room or has enough power - it sounds more like Mickey Mouse in a way. Whereas the other sound effects perfectly match the song, they simply ruined the sound of Jon's voice. My deepest wish? Get rid of this producer, who messes up a good song, really!<br /><br />WHAT ABOUT NOW (8/10)<br /><br />With \\"What about Now\\" Bon Jovi pick up a question that many people have inside their heads nowadays. What happens to our world, what happens to us? It's a typical Bon Jovi song that is full of optimism, even if the world is rather dark at the moment. A real stand-up song for all the people around the world. Get up and fight for what you love.  Reminds me a little of \\"Lost Highway\\" at the beginning and is a nice song to listen to.<br /><br />PICTURES OF YOU (9/10)<br /><br />Starts off with a fresh sound that reminds me a little of the Killers or Imagine Dragons. So this time, it's Bon Jovi - and it's not too bad. Still more pop than rock, but I learned to love this song. Give it a try!<br /><br />AMEN (8/10)<br /><br />With the song \\"Amen\\" Bon Jovi do what they are known for - including a ballad that should not be missing in any of Bon Jovi's records. I have mixed feelings when it comes to this song. First of all, there is the line \\"mercy, mercy what else can I say\\" - well, not the best example of outstanding songwriting but okay. The songsgets better in the middle and Jon proves that he is still able to make his audience shiver. Including violins was a good idea in my opinion and it suits the song's atmosphere very well. And the song, apart from the mercy line, has some nice lyrics.<br /><br />THAT'S WHAT THE WATER MADE ME (7/10)<br /><br />Baby, Baby, baby there is no use in trying to save me - well not their most creative line to open up a song. You're confronted with Baby, baby, in nearly every second song that is playing on the radio. But still, I don't hate this song -  the chorus is really catchy and it's a nice mid tempo song you can relax and sing along to while driving in your car, windows down. However, I really ask myself what they did in the middle of the song - sounds like as if they replaced Tico's drums with computerized drums that sound like a tin drum -  again, it could be a nice song if it was not produced in the way it was.<br /><br />WHAT'S LEFT OF ME (5/10)<br /><br />Reminds me a little of the Lost Highway times because of the accustic and country elements. And we can also find the \\"Hey, hey\\" elements we all know since \\"Who says you can't go home\\". Works out great in a stadium, but still I don't like this song too much. Nothing special and could have been on Lost Highway. Honestly? I almost ever switch to the next song.<br /><br />ARMY OF ONE (6,5/10)<br /><br />Finally! Tico is back and we can clearly hear his familiar style of drumming. And this time it is real drums and not faked ones straight from the producer's PC. The song also uses some sound elements we know from Living On A Prayer. What follows then is different version of Status Quo's \\"You're in the Army now\\" - at least, I felt like this in a way. Sign me up, I'm a soldier\\" -  ahh yes, so this time life is compared to a kind of a war situation and again we have the message to stay strong. I don't know if it is just me, but I really have the feeling that suddenly there are a lot of songs that use military elements. Seems like a new trend, for whatever reason there is. Again, the lyrics are not brilliant but easily to remember -  \\"never give up, never give up, never, never give up, never let up\\".<br /><br />THICK AS THIEVES (10/10)<br /><br />Although it is a ballade again, I really learned to love this song. Maybe it is because it finally deals with a different topic than the economic downfall and all the problems that come with it. The song is about love and friendship, being there over the years, even if there are hard times. If we ignore the line \\"It's classic boy meets girl\\" we could also think of Jon's and Richie's friendship over the years. Makes me smile and proves how close they are.<br /><br />BEAUTIFUL WORLD (9/10)<br /><br />Listen closely! Do you recognize the melody? No? Then listen to Matchbox Twenty's song \\"How far We've come\\" sounds almost the same in a way. I don't know if they did it on purpose or not, but if they did so, it is kind of funny. Cause the song deals with our messed up world, where everybody wants to be famous and individual and hipster like (which is also true for most bands nowadays that hop on the same band wagon) - so take it as a number with an ironic twist \\"Ain't it a beautiful world\\"?<br /><br />ROOM AT THE END OF THE WORLD (10/10)<br /><br />I tell you - over the last two days this has become my favorite track of the record and I listen to it on repeat. Again it is a rather slow song but a pretty good one. While listening to the song, close your eyes and the pictures inside your head will come almost automatically. Perfect example of how sound effects can underline a song without destroying it. Good job guys!<br /><br />THE FIGHTER (6/10)<br /><br /> The Fighter\\" is the last track of the album (if you have the regular version of the CD). As far as I know, Jon wrote this for his kids to show them that he is more than the rockstar they know from television. Would also perfectly match for a movie.<br />Nevertheless - I can't really like the song or let's say I'm torn apart. I mean it's kind of cool to see Jon as a father and not a rockstar, but at the same time I ask myself if this song really needs to be included on an album. It's okay to me, but nothing more.<br /><br />TO SUM IT UP:<br /><br />As I said at the beginning - I was never so torn apart with any of their albums. It is definitely not what I was expecting, but at the end it is also not a complete nightmare. I think what this album needs is time! As Jon mentions in \\"Room at the End of the World\\": Take your time and take it slow - and I think this perfectly describes what you should do.<br />Take the time and listen to the record for a few times, lay it aside and listen to it again. Songs I couldn't relate to at first, now turned into songs I really like.<br />So, if you don't expect them to be the rockband of the 80s or 90s they used to be and if you are open for a change in their style then this is a good, although not perfect album.<br /><br />Greetings from Germany<br />(so don't be too harsh on my English)ms like a new trend, for whatever reason there is.

B00B4VXQC8|5.0|I'm a 26 year old bon jovi fan, been listening since keep the faith and have seen them in concert as recently as 3 weeks ago. While I miss new jersey, keep the faith, and these days era bon jovi, it is gone. People get older and change with the times and I'm ok with that. I think considering the state of rock music these days this album really is pretty good. I'm with you is one I can't wait to play again right after it finishes, and I don't know why people are saying there's no guitar solos cuz Richie tears it up on that one. Army of one has a nice solo as well, no these are no dry county leads but they've been there done that. Jons voice isn't as great as it once was but for a man in his early 50s he sounds great, at least he don't attempt to sing crazy notes that he can't hit like some singers of yester year do and they sound terrible ie Don Dokken. Though not my favorite album by a mile, its still better than anything out there now. Good job guys
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I love this movie !  I have it on my phone and Tablet and watch it when I'm waiting.  Great deal on it !
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is now my faviote game but I didn't really how many mega bitts it takes. 296 I think is a little to much!!!!!!
B002XZOZQA|5.0|I find myself singing and humming the music to this movie. I love it! Love the tits and ass song the best! lol
B008J34466|3.0|Sadly, I was disappointed.  I don't know if it was the way it was produced or what, but the sound quality was not good and her title song was the best of the bunch.  :(
B005OCFHHK|5.0|Shipment arrived on time. Kids love it and watch it daily,overall satisfied with purchase and quality of DVD ordered. Excellent
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|this season was great and it made sense on how it was following what happened in season 2. it kept showing a lot of zombie scenes and also made some surprising endings. it is always making you want more. unfortunately season 3 has made this show more about politics than zombies. i believe walking dead was good in season 1 and 2 but was horrible with the rest
B00AREIAI8|5.0|i have to say i'm not a big game app fan but this has me hooked. very easy to play and graphics are great.
B003L20IHE|3.0|the movie is good but i did get bored in some parts. overall the movie is okay and i would recommend it to anyone who likes Nicholas Sparks movies. Even though this story is not by Nicholas Sparks it is very similar to his movies.
B002VRZEYM|5.0|This is a informative documentary of how the food indusrty is pulling the wool over our eyes, making us think we are eating good food, when really,  all they are doing is helping us become a nation full of overweight, unhappy, unhealthy people.  Everyone needs to watch this documentary. It is wonderfully put together, showing thoughts and oppinions of many different people.  As it states in the end: \\"Vote with your dollar\\". Make the best choices you are able to, budget and time allowing. We can all make a difference, one purchase at a time!
B0058YPILY|5.0|i love this show and this season has great episodes that show you the lives of all the main characters. I always watch this show and having all the seasons is the best thing i own. no matter what i always look forward for the next season to be release on dvd
B00A757EFW|5.0|This is so awesome to be able to have this classic arcade game on your on tablet because classics never die so if you love a good classic game of Pac Man then you definitely want this app.
0399237720|5.0|The book speaks for itself.  It's a classic and kids love it.  What I didn't realize from the picture, is that this particular board book is very large and has a handle which is integrated into the book.  It also comes with a small plush hungry catapillar which is nice when reading the story to use to demonstrate the catapillar eating his way through the food, not to mention perfectly sized for little hands.  I know the description states \\"giant board book and plush package\\" but again, the picture does not match the description so I was curious as to which item I would receive.  I was looking for a large board book without the handle, because the handle is not very sturdy and arrived bent/damaged.  I didn't bother contacting Amazon as with a few uses the handle will bend anyhow (and remain crinkled), hence the reason I was looking for a board book without the handle.  I am pleasantly surprised by the little plush though :)
0689835604|1.0|The book isn't like new. It missing the some pages that over the picture. Really upset with the quality of the book!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Very different from what we are used to from this author. At the beginning, it's a bit slow to start, and I felt as if the characters fell in love way too quickly (before they even had a real first date) which made the story a bit hard to believe. However, the story had a lot of depth, and there was so much to the characters. I loved reading about Katie 's past, and seeing how that played a role in her life. Lovely story with a happy ending. If you are looking for an easy read I definitely recommend it.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|The author definitely did her research on quads before writing this book. It is a very thought provoking book. My husband became a quad at 60. Everyday is a challenging day for us. I definitely would recommend this book and it would be a great book for a book club. It was a powerful read for me.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This book is in dire need of a good editor.  The frequent typos, grammatical errors, and generally weak writing were major distractions to what otherwise would have been a compelling story.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I really enjoy the game. Very addicting and will keep you paying for weeks.  But is basically a temple run clone.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|While I may not like Taylor Swift in entertainment news, her songs are still absolutely wonderful. More grown up on this CD!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|The game is good for horse lovers. I played this game on my iPod touch but I like it better on my kindle because of the screen size.
B005QMOZOO|2.0|Set years after the ending of Pride and Prejudice, Death Comes to Pemberley focuses on the lives of Lizzy and Darcy, how married life suits them, their children, the estate, and of course a suspect murder. I think I spent most of this book rolling my eyes. Sickeningly sweet moments between Lizzy and Darcy, are interspersed with details of an implausible crime thats occurred on their land. It's incredibly wordy, and I feel like in some places 5 pages of text were used when only 1 page was necessary.<br />If you're a fan of Pride and Prejudice, but prefer the movies over the book, then you may like this book. But a Jane Austen purist will spurn it.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game! You get lots of horses and take care of them. If you want a horse I would recommend you to get this game. It is deffenetly for a horse lover.
B009ZXT4BY|4.0|I downloaded it.... it was awesome!! it started being dumb and wouldn't work!!!  then I deleted it other than that great game!!!!!!
B00AYHKIZ6|3.0|Not a bad album but not worth the 10 year wait. There are few bigger Bowie fans... I've got about three or four editions of everything from his discography .. but I just cannot get into this.  Many of the songs seem like weaker versions of things he has done in the past ...  often sounding like weak outtakes from Scary Monsters.  I think people are giving it such good reviews because of the excitement surrounding his reemergence.  If this was released a couple of years after \\"Reality\\" it would have been largely ignored.  I'm glad that he is 'back' but I'm not impressed with the release.<br /><br />Oh...and if you go to Bowie's official web site you can now buy an official album cover t-shirt for $145.00.  Yep, $145.00 for a t-shirt.  One wonders if Bowie is back for money.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|An achingly honest journey. Along the way to discovering who you are all while trying to be present in the now. This story is a universal tale of what we all may have felt while growing up. A must read.
B00782O7IY|2.0|Very anxious to see this movie, given all the hype. Was very disappointed. One of the most overrated films I've seen in the last forty years. At best, two stars. Perhaps I'm not sophisticated enough to recognize the \\"art\\" contained in this film, but I just don't see it. Judge for yourself.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|The item is good, but requires some patience to ensure it works the way it should.<br /><br />Ju will have to clean the lens, and asume that your kinct will probably get scratched placing this on, but once you do, and everything is in place, the recognition improved to a really new level.
B00B2TUKI0|2.0|I'm always excited to see a new album by Madeleine Peyroux, but I have to prepare myself for disappointment.  I thought Bare Bones, with her original compositions, was pretty great, but I felt like most people did not like it.  For me, this new album contains some bizarre song choices that highlight the uniqueness of Madeleine's voice and delivery, but not in a good way.<br /><br />I suppose she is trying to update her image by tackling songs from the 60s-70s.  However, the songs - particularly Bird on the Wire and Gentle on My Mind - do not fit Peyroux's very mannered and polished style.  She tends to take liberties with the melody.  Because every note is so precise, I have no doubt that her choices are deliberate and even rehearsed, but for me they just don't work, particularly on these two songs.  The effect is like sitting in a cabaret listening to a singer who looks great but is a bit off-key.  I actually winced a few times listening to these two songs.<br /><br />For me the most successful track on this album is You Don't Know Me.  It's more adaptable to a variety of genres and styles.  I am reminded of Meryl Streep in Postcards from the Edge, being urged to sing, and she sits down at the piano and pulls out this song.  It's a good song for Madeleine because there is not an iconic version out there, it's a song that's been covered a lot and hers could end up being your favorite version.<br /><br />I really do applaud Madeleine Peyroux.  There's no one else like her.  She sounds so much like Billie Holiday sometimes, but her image feels so carefully cultivated and totally her own.  I'm wavering between 2 and 3 stars on this record.  I'm going with 2.  I feel like the song choices set her up for failure.  This may be one of those records that I like better with repeated listening.  I will try it again in the future when I get in a Madeleine Peyroux mood.  There are definitely those moods - just disappointed with this particular record.
B0009S3HI0|5.0|This was a really nice CD for my collection, and still hear it from time to time. just plain old great!

B0092D1V5Y|5.0|You tell it how it is it really does just say &quot; pretend to hack &quot; so you other people who gave 1star reviews learn to read and quit your bitching
0307352153|5.0|This is a groundbreaking book, at least to me. I have read plenty of marriage and parental improvement books, but none that I recall address the potential pitfalls and methods of working with introverted individuals. Cain has an engaging writing and storytelling style that makes this book an easy read. I didn't necessarily think of myself as an introvert until I began reading through the checklist she put together at the beginning of the book. I knew I enjoyed my personal time to read, enjoyed expressing my feelings in writing and sometimes just had to get away from others, but only as I read this book did it dawn on me that these traits put me largely in the introvert camp. As the father of a possibly introverted child, there are some good take aways for me from this book as well. And the conclusion - talk about a life's manifesto! Overall, well done and fascinating read.
B005WBBYXO|5.0|love this story--gives you a lot to think about.  inventive ideas and fast paced storyline that really keeps you interested
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I thought the characters in this book were so interesting. I found myself rooting for them as they challenged themselves and won!

B00821OUT6|5.0|I love this show! I just finished watching season two and now I'm going though Falling Skies withdraws. I cannot wait for season three.
B00AYHKIZ6|4.0|Been a fan of Bowie's music since his Ziggy period in the early 70's as well as his big early fame with \\"Major Tom\\".  The man has had so many changes over the years, that's what always kept me guessing what he would cook up next. I saw him live during his last tour 10 years ago and he was making some great music and then the heart problems and silence all these years. I've been slowly taking this new music all in and I like this new stuff, Bowie through all his commerical sides and the hits, has that arty, abstract side that puts him in class with few peers. He's not trying to make \\"hits\\" but does manage to bring some well needed adult radio class to \\"The Next day\\". I've been liking \\"Love is lost\\",  \\"The Dirty Boys\\", \\"The Stars(are out tonight)\\", \\"Dancing out in space\\", \\"I'd rather be high\\". The opener \\"The Next Day\\" sets the tone for these songs and you'll hear musical pieces in many songs that will remind you of Bowie's different periods. Great production and musicanship and of course Bowie does a great job on the vocals bringing together many musical memory flashbacks and even on the first single, \\"Where are we now?\\" a song so unlike \\"The Next Day\\", yet compelling in its eerie, emotional simplicity and pathos. Many of my favorite musical collections(albums?) are the one's I've taken time to appreicate, you need to listen to these songs many times to fully realize all the many layers Bowie and producer Tony Visconti, as well as the many musicans deliver on this. Lastly, some will have a hard time with Bowie's off beat timings and melodies(not to mention the LYRICS, but even with a song like \\"If you can see me\\" you either get it or you don't, I find a song like this just adds more spice to this mix, you even get a few extras on the delux Cd of The Next Day, the \\"Plan\\" being the opening to the video of \\"The stars(are out tonight)\\", its all very interesting new Bowie, growing on me with every listen.
B00B2TTVNU|5.0|This is an absolutely splendid performance! Here is all of Rachmaninov's passion and tension, but also with an expansive tenderness that never wilts into sloppy sentimentality. Valentina Lisitsa's take on this extraordinary music is truly breathtaking -- and big props to the LSO and conductor Michael Francis for insightful, fluid, and vigorous accompaniment. Yes, Ms. Lisitsa can play fast, but never at the expense of clarity or eloquence. This will be a personal favorite for years to come with shining moments of such gorgeous yearning and pathos, it's like hearing them for the first time every time. Brava, Valentina!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|the book was great. it completed all questions about the 2 other books . i loved the series  its great

1594484805|4.0|Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us by Daniel H. Pink<br /><br />\\"Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us\\" is a fascinating book about motivation. The main premise of the book is that there is gap between what science knows and what business does. It is his goal to repair such breach. Lawyer by education but has never had to practice and best-selling author, Daniel H. Pink compels readers to a new approach based on three essential elements: autonomy, mastery and purpose. With great ease and mastery, Pink provides many examples that show that a new approach in management is needed. This legible 242-page book is composed of the following six chapters: 1. The Rise and Fall of Motivation 2.0, 2. Seven Reasons Carrots and Sticks (Often) Don't Work, 3. Type I and Type X, 4. Autonomy, 5. Mastery, and 6. Purpose.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1. Engaging, accessible prose on a fascinating topic, motivation.<br />2. Excellent format. Easy to follow book and the author goes out of his way to provide the readers multiple tools to make the journey enjoyable. Tools that include a very helpful glossary, summaries, and essential book lists.<br />3. The book is full of practical and interesting examples that not only makes the book fun to read but helps the author lay out his thoughts and vision on motivation.<br />4. Understanding the flaws on outdated motivation techniques. \\"Too many organizations--not just companies, but governments and nonprofits as well--still operate from assumptions about human potential and individual performance that are outdated, unexamined, and rooted more in folklore than in science.\\"<br />5. This is a thought-provoking book. Some thoughts will resonate and stay with you, \\"The best use of money as a motivator is to pay people enough to take the issue of money off the table.\\"<br />6. The seven reasons why carrot-and-stick extrinsic motivators often produce the opposite of what they set out to achieve. A look at intrinsic motivation. The Sawyer Effect, turning play into work. The effects of contingent rewards on the creative process. \\"When people use rewards to motivate, that's when they're most demotivating.\\" Great stuff!<br />7. The difference between Type X and Type I behavior. The need for organizations to move from Type X and Type I personalities. That is, move from extrinsically motivated to intrinsically motivated people. \\"...for Type X's, the main motivator is external rewards; any deeper satisfaction is welcome, but secondary. For Type I's, the main motivator is the freedom, challenge, and purpose of the undertaking itself; any other gains are welcome, but mainly as a bonus\\".<br />8. Understanding Type I personalities. \\"Type I behavior depends on three nutrients: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. Type I behavior is self-directed. It is devoted to becoming better and better at something that matters. And it connects that quest for excellence to a larger purpose.\\"<br />9. Understanding the value of autonomy. \\"A sense of autonomy has a powerful effect on individual performance and attitude\\".<br />10. The four essentials. \\"And what a few future-facing businesses are discovering is that one of these essential features is autonomy--in particular, autonomy over four aspects of work: what people do, when they do it, how they do it, and whom they do it with<br />11. Understanding the value of mastery. \\"Where Motivation 2.0 sought compliance, Motivation 3.0 seeks engagement. Only engagement can produce mastery. And the pursuit of mastery, an important but often dormant part of our third drive, has become essential in making one's way in today's economy\\".<br />12. The three laws of mastery: it's a mindset, is a pain, and it's an asymptote.<br />13. The purpose of motive. \\"Motivation 3.0 doesn't reject profits, but it places equal emphasis on purpose maximization. We see the first stirrings of this new purpose motive in three realms of organizational life--goals, words, and policies\\".<br />14. The book inspired me to look at some of the \\"big questions\\" from a different perspective. In particular, to the question of purpose; and that's why I read.<br />15. The author provides the reader with a toolkit that can be put into action. Many interesting and different ways to use the principles of this book for a greater good on a variety of levels.<br />16. The toolkit and its applications to the real world.<br />17. The philosophy from the seven business gurus.<br />18. The Drive Discussion Guide. Great tool for book clubs.<br />19. Links to Notes worked great.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />1. The book appears to suffer from confirmation bias. The author appears to be convinced and overly optimistic that he has the cure for what ails businesses and people alike. The author rarely presents data that doesn't confirm what he espouses. I find his arguments compelling but it may be that I am only being presented a picture that is favorable to the author's point of view. It's my contention that this is a much more complex issue than is being sold.<br />2. The book is repetitive. The author hammers his main points to a fault.<br />3. Light on the science side of the ledger. The author purposely focuses on making the book accessible but it comes at a cost. Neuroscience? What is the consensus among scientists?<br />4. The book provides studies indicating that in essence we are punished by rewards such as gold stars in a classroom. In Justice Sotomayor's recent book, \\"My Beloved World\\" she stated that those gold stars motivated her to succeed.<br />5. Some analogies are ill suited. I would have stayed away from using the calamity of the housing market to illustrate short-term rewards. The analogy is fitting up until the point you bring home buyers who were looking to reach the long-term dream of home ownership into the picture. Once again, it's much more complex than that.<br />6. The author tends to equate extrinsic motivation to money. Extrinsic motivation can come in many forms and incentives: time off, flexibility, supplies, upgraded tools, praise, promotions, titles and acceptance of ideas.<br />7. Depending on your familiarity with the topic of motivation this book may come across as a rehash of old ideas repackaged as new ones.<br />8. Oversimplified. As much as I enjoyed the book on a casual level it strikes me as oversimplified. Managerial decisions are not always an X versus Y, there are usually many more variables at play and at times they even converge.<br /><br />In summary, I enjoyed the book. It is an interesting book on what motivates us. Pink relies on four decades of scientific research to come up with his own modified view on what is the best approach to motivate people. It's provocative and quite readable but at times I felt it is done so at the expense of the complete picture. Confirmation bias and oversimplification keeps it from being a comprehensive effort. That being said, it is a worthwhile read that you can take something from. I recommend it!<br /><br />Further suggestions: \\"[[ASIN:1400069289 The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do in Life and Business]]\\" by Charles Duhigg, \\"[[ASIN:0345472322 Mindset: The New Psychology of Success]]\\" and \\"[[ASIN:1841690244 Self-theories: Their Role in Motivation, Personality, and Development]]\\" by Carol Dweck, \\"[[ASIN:0142001104 The Art of Possibility: Transforming Professional and Personal Life]]\\" by Rosamund Stone Zander, \\"[[ASIN:055380684X The Talent Code: Greatness Isn't Born.

034544678X|5.0|This is a wonderful, refreshing, and clarifying read!<br /><br />Please read the description of this book and notice that if you are looking for a how to manual and training techniques, you will NOT find it here. This is about understanding how primate and canine communication differs and how certain human tendencies actually confuse our dogs even when we feel we've been crystal clear.<br /><br />This book is a challenge to the reader to stop asking the dog to do all the translating from primate to dog.  We've got the bigger brain, shouldn't translation be handled by us? That means learning what your dog is telling you!  You'll understand your best friend a lot more if you try, and that's something every dog owner should want.<br /><br />If you think you've got a bad dog, this book will make you think again. It will challenge you to look at yourself and how you are behaving and it will ask you, \\"How does that look to your dog?\\" \\"What are you ACTUALLY telling him?\\"  Often you will find that you were saying \\"stop that,\\" in English, but really you were communicating \\"That's great! \\"Keep going!\\" to your dog.<br /><br />If you want more than how to's and surface level dog training, this is the book for you!  It's not a replacement for how to's, but it is a great way to assist your training and make it even MORE effective!

B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is really fun game great game for everyone even fun for on the go when you are really bored
B0060AY6FO|2.0|I'm not a real fan of murder mysteries, but thought P.D. James might produce a good one with my favorite characters.  I found it okay, but could guess who did it way before the ending.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great read! A true view of the war not corrupted by the news media or politicians. Although America lost a true hero, I hope that this book inspires people to understand war and support veterans.
0312330537|3.0|In my view it just missed being 4 star.  It is a very good read but a little too long.The slums of Mumbai could have been shortened without detracting from the book in any way.  On the other hand the journey back from Afghanistan would have benefited from a greater explanation.
B00AQB2A3I|4.0|Dunno what I was expecting from this new record, but I know I didn't expect the F A T & catchy bass riffs that open the first track, Luminol. Holy smokes! This record is good! Harkens back to the P Tree days of old. Buy this & be rewarded for your good taste!
B0065UF2ZM|4.0|This Michael Connelly book is up to the usual great standard..It is a pleasure to read such a well written book.

B005GFPZYK|5.0|You get a perspective of a true patriot and what  it is like trough their eyes and those closest to them, how it affects them.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|I had been concerned; around books 5-13, things were getting pretty predictable, plot-wise. But I confess, this is the best Reacher novel yet IMHO, followed closely by A Wanted Man, immediately previous in the series. Child clearly has upped his game, it settling for writing the same book over and over anymore. We all benefit from his challenge to himself. I'm very glad Child has decided not to take the was way out. Excellent book, all around. Thank you, Lee Child!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I love Dean Holder!  I loved the story and all the characters. I would like to know more about these characters. A sequel maybe?  Especially Six, I'd definitely like to know her story.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This was, is, and will always be one of my favorite books of all time. I read this book 5 times before the movie was released(I still have yet to see the movie, so I can not compare). However it will be hard to live up to such an extraordinary book. The story of Charlie is so touching, just an amazingly written book. I definitely encourage reading the book (several times if you love it) before seeing the movie! Thank you to Stephen Chbosky for this fantastic piece of work.
B008YWY0HK|3.0|The movie isn't bad, but it isn't my favorite Disney movie.  The story doesn't cover a wide audience.  A 10 year old boy doesn't care that a girl doesn't want to get married, but loved the parts with the trouble-making triplets. This movie shouldn't have won an Oscar in my opinion, but what can you do.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I really enjoy this app. So great for those long car trips. Best way for us to pass the time.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I love everything about Tina Fey, so no brainier for me to buy and read this book....I was one of the 5 million fans ;)<br />This book was amazing....end of story.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|GEEZ LOUISE! This was Way Deeper than I thought it would be! A very well written story that I couldn't put down until I was finished!
B00936A0RU|5.0|Loved this movie, although I truly wished - spoiler- that LaBeouf's character would die. Nevertheless, the draw in this movie is Hardy, Chastain, and Pearce. They totally rocked. This is a good ol' fashion gangster movie. A must add to your collection. A must see.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|You'll be enthralled from the first page to the very end.  I couldn't put it down!  It's a great read.
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|If you are looking for thrill a minute ACTION ACTION ACTION!!!!!!! this game is not for you. If you enjoy a creepy game of cat and mouse without a bunch of blood, gore, or complicated gameplay, you might like this one. Be ready though, he cheats.
B000SW4DH6|4.0|A very entertaining mix of modern pop songs and a classical setting.  Great performances and great sets highlight this story.
B00BHMETKC|4.0|Captures the adince full of suspense - even though you know the end.<br />Recomend to anyone . . . .
B0035J6TAI|3.0|It's good not great.  The symphonic accompaniment lends to a &#34;everything sounds the same&#34; feel to the CD.  Overall the sound is good, but frankly I don't listen to it a lot.
B005V20JKI|3.0|For some reason the paid version doesnt have co-op....I wonder why not. Me and my girlfriend downloaded this game to play as a team but now we can't.
B004H4XL7E|5.0|Great book!  I now walk into a meeting with a different attitude.  I am not selling to them, I am seeing if I want them to be my clients.  What a complete game changer.
B00AKKTDJY|5.0|I love this game, it's challenging and fun. Keeps you on your toes to get all the upgrades. My kids enjoy trying to beat my scores.
B000I9VZKW|3.0|i, enjoyed this movie for a late night viewing. I liked looking at the little pieces of technology Alex Proyas employed with his imagination. This movie lacked deep characters. It was a movie that shouda, coulda, but didn'ta. It was a fast food type of movie, &#34;Here is your order, sir.&#34; You already ate it a hundred of times. I already know what it is going to taste like.
B007ZLKK9I|5.0|A very deep and thorough perspective on George. He touched so many, and was such a phenomenal songwriter.  He and John are sorely missed.
B00846REIS|5.0|Although there are similarities to Fifty Shades the main characters have different stories and really different lives. I can't wait to read the next one.
B004A8ZWW4|3.0|I was looking for a story that would keep my nephews and nieces occupied while I entertained their parents. This movie proved to be entertaining enough, that I could show it to them several times.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The shocking war stories were very attention getting, and I learned a bit about history.  I loved the love story of Bates and Anna, and the turning of Downton Abbey into a hospital.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|I have rented many instant DVD movies from amazon but this is the worse quality I have ever seen. The images are blurry and there are some scenes that appear they are lower than VGA quality. Absolutely unacceptable.
B005LAII62|2.0|I own a lot of movies, anime, lots of horror, drama, old samurai flicks, action etc.  last count was two years ago at over 1.2K DVDs.  I wouldn't buy this.  Thankfully we rented it via Netflix.  Animation wise it's very well done, plot wise it's made for either a whiny wuss emo kid in their early 20s or teens or lesser aged moron.  It started off well enough, except the public school teaching religious anything, because that doesn't happen in real life.  Humorous at first, good lines and good voice acting.  Then at about the midway point when it was really starting to take off action wise it's like everyone stopped caring. Writing went down, voice acting was tops all the way though, plot suffered and then the end \\"boss\\" was about as well done as a 5 year olds arguement... I've seen end bosses in Contra levels with more i stance than this BS.<br /><br />Rent if you must, don't buy.  Give it a year and it'll be in the dollar bin at Wally World.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Love this book. Perfect story, perfect set up, perfect ending. I love this series and author so so so much
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|This movie was so cute. It had wonderful humor, and could entertain a movie lovers palette for almost every taste! We just rented it, but this is a must own for our collection!!!
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I bought this album because it was on special and i really like his current song on radio &#34;when i was your man' and i LOVE it!! i can listen to the whole album over and over--his voice is soo smooth!!
B00BESLHEA|2.0|Seemed the movie was just jumbled together, Plot and story just seemed to lack and more focused on the fighting scenes and nothing else.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Series of books that just keep getting better with every page. I love the characters and they way they interact. No twilight dribble here
B003U9TDII|5.0|Hanz Zimmer has been called the successor to John Williams.  In popularity, this is certainly true, but the composers have very, very different traits.  One of Zimmers' best, in my opinion, is still the original score for Pirates of the Caribbean:  At World's End.  However, this is probably the best he has done since then.  Mombasa is adrenaline pulsing and heart-pounding, while Waiting for a Train will haunt your dreams.  Time is the perfect climax, bringing together both the tide of wonder and melancholy sorrow, which the film engenders.  If you're looking for an original score with various emotions, this is as good as any other.
B002SRQ214|5.0|Good processor, I know intel has a superior architecture with SAndy/Ivy bridge but if you're not a photo/video/audio/editor or top notch gamer this is a great processor. I do a lot of matlab work and multi application work. Nothing terribly resource intensive but I always have a gazillion programs open and I rarely see the processor climb above 30 percent load. Don't be fooled though, this thing can game with the right clock and settings. But when it comes to price for perfomance, this cpu will bring you up to date with technology and serve most users well.
B005XN31LY|4.0|It is ok for a tv series, like how it is family friendly and we can all sit down and watch it together.
B005ZI2X4I|5.0|I read this book to my son.  I had a lot of fun reading this book; however, my son got a bit scared from how I read the book.  My son does not believe in snow alligators but he cant explain where all the scarves came from except to say the scarves came from under the snow.  This will be a book we will enjoy again and again.  Thanks for a great bedtime story!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It works most of the time but shuts down every now and again, missing some features I'm use to having on my phone app.
B0002EXH4K|5.0|Not much to say about this one.  It's a cd, in brand new shape.  If you love Megadeath, the you know this cd rocks.

B005CRQ4XI|4.0|A book suggested by nothing more than the title and yet a beautiful self discovery book. Her feet alone telling the trials of the trail and the self loathing tamed only by the constant grinding of each step. Well done.
1451627297|5.0|This was my first Stephen King book.  He is a master story teller and I found this 850 page book to be a veritable &#34;page turner&#34;!<br />I loved the premise even while questioning f the morality of the means to the desirable end.
B001TCNSOI|5.0|I recommend this film. It certainly kept my attention throughout the entire duration.<br /><br />If you are in search of a film with Angelina Jolie, who plays the protagonist, outside of Tomb Raider and Mr. & Mrs. Smith, then this film is choice. I searched films by Jolie; low and behold, a great piece. I think Angelina Jolie is one of the best actresses, because she possesses the talent to play these dynamic roles.<br /><br />Great film at home, during colder weather.<br /><br />Come to find out, and was pleasantly surprised, Jeffrey Donovan plays an important role. Always been a sucker for Jeffrey Donovan!<br /><br />Enjoy.
B00BJG7H3M|4.0|I love Suits and I have to own them even after I watch them on TV.<br /><br />That being said, the episodes downloaded are a bit shorter than the actual ones being broadcast.<br /><br />Case in point, the final episode of season 2. War was 54 minutes long (without commercials) when it was shown on TV but the downloaded version is only 43 Minutes.<br /><br />I did a side-by-side comparison and event though the \\"omitted\\" scenes were not critical to the overall show's finale, it is still a shame that they were left out. And this was the case for a few other episodes as well (maybe 3 or 4 altogether).<br /><br />Nevertheless, Suits is an excellent show and I will keep on buying them, but I will be watching them on TV as well.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|So... I first had a different Alfa, the green 2000mw one. I just came upon an older laptop that was looking for a use. The laptop had its own internal wifi... But sort of weak. I was going to use the green one with the RaLink chip in it... But it always seems to have hiccups with my Backtrack setups, especially in VMware. Well, I saw this white one and noticed it has a RealTek chip in it (widely used). I got this and so far BackTrack hasn't had any problems. So, now I have a war-driving machine and am probably going to drill holes in the lid of the laptop to permenantly zip-tie the Alfa on board. Yay!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Les MIZ the movie-musical is very good--<br />everyone in fine form, except Russell Crowe.<br />He is a terrific actor, but a novice musically.<br />Hugh Jackman, Anne Hathway, and Eddie Redmayne<br />are excellent!  However, I would wait for the 2 disc<br />deluxe edition--I prefer the whole enchilada to mere<br />highlights.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This is my 6 year old son's new favorite movie. He has watched it over & over since we got it. Very cute family film. Entertaining and endearing.
0671570439|5.0|Carl Sagan had a gem of inspiration:<br />What would happen if there really were contact with a<br />superior Alien civilization?  I will not give away any spoilers,<br />but if you thought Jodie Foster was terrific as Dr. Eleanor Arroway<br />in the movie, wait until you listen to her dramatic reading of Sagan's novel!<br />She does male and female characters brilliantly, Indian, Chinese, Russian accents--<br />she is truly a woman of a Thousand Voices! She does not merely read, but packs a punch with her emotions.<br />As for Carl Sagan, it is a tragedy that he did not write any more novels--he has the midas touch of science!<br />Also recommended, Isaac Asimov's FOUNDATION Trilogy.  Splendid!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Spark has a beautiful imagination that shows through once again. Love trumps through diversity. This book, although good, does not top his list.
6304711905|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  I love Kurt Russell, Val Kilmer and Sam Elliot.  They are the bomb.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game so much. It's a lot of fun and keeps you on your feet! :) I never get tired of it, the setting is always changing. I recommend this game if you liked Temple Run.
B00BEPVAV8|1.0|it ducks like a vaccum and it looks like a freaking chick without a Burt hole getting satin by a koala
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I have never usually read books like this but I loved it. You keep rooting for them to make it the book leaves you wanting more.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This has been an amazing book and I can't wait to see. The movie. I really felt for Charlie and his story
B002JWD6AS|5.0|AMAZING!!!!!!<br />I can't wait to read the next book called Linger!!!! I could easily read this book again!!! LOVED IT!!
B008AK8FHM|4.0|Having lost some very special people this year and continueing to pursue our spiritual selves, I found this very comforting.  It was also comforting to read about a scientist changing his mind on the here-after.
B00942X8PY|5.0|It's scary how easy this game is to pick up and so hard to put down.  My first attempt was only going to be a few levels...but 30mins later, I was still playing. The gameplay is easy to pickup.  You have a colored block that can fill in a certain number of spaces on a grid.  You drag the block through the grid and fill in the spaces.  It sounds EASY, right?  Wait for it...<br /><br />Later in the game, you are faced with multiple colored blocks.  Some blocks might fill 5 spaces.  Some might only fill 2.  Then, certain blank spaces can only be filled by certain colors.  Then you encounter one-way blocks that only allow you to go in one direction.  Not just one &#34;one way block&#34; but several!  Throw in &#34;wraparound tunnels&#34; at the edge of the grid that take your colored block to the other side of the grid.  Wait for it...<br /><br />Math rears its head with blocks that will add, subtract, or multiply the number of colored blocks you have to fill the grid.  So, in addition to keeping track of multiple colors, one way and wraparound blocks, you now have to do math!  Again, not just one math block -- but several.<br /><br />The game might look really easy but there is plenty of challenge to be had.  Highly recommend for anybody who likes a good puzzle.
B002TLSSXO|4.0|pros<br />Very easy on the eyes<br /><br />Comfortable grips<br /><br />Very functional<br /><br />cons<br />The colored part is quite heat sensitive and will melt if it is in contact with hot cookware<br /><br />The counterweight inside the handle of the yellow ladle is barely heavy enough to balance it while clean and dry.<br /><br />The edges fray ever-so-slightly
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is an awesome game it has every thing u could ever ask for<br />I love playing this game and am glad I got it
B00BEPVAV8|4.0|fun fun fun. its a great way to pass the time. my 7 year old and I both enjoy it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Downton Abbey continues to develop great characters and stories worth following.  It will be interesting to see where our characters will develop in the next season.
B00BEZTMWW|1.0|You can read the book twice and have more fun.  I bored watching this film in the theatre and will be again if I bought the DVD.  Buy the book here and be happy.  http://www.amazon.com/The-Hobbit-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/054792822X/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1363181964&sr=8-4&keywords=the+hobbit
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games Trilogy is easily my favorite series ever written. I was appalled at some of the reviews mentioning this displeasure with the ending. Did you actually expect a happy ending? Katniss began a journey at the tender age of 16 and came out a completely changed person. She has even referred to herself in the book as \\"old katniss\\" recognizing she can never go back to who she was before. As for Peeta, I like almost ever reader, am absolutely in love with him. Everything he stands for and everything he does. But he too, has been through more than we can imagine. The Hunger Games is told through the heart of Katniss. We do not get to see Peeta's inner struggle, we do not get to see the torture he has endured. How could Peeta ever be the same? The characters of the story will never be the same, no matter how \\"good\\" the world may be after their accomplishments. I felt like this story was so incredibly true and inspiring even though I shed many tears over the course of the three novels.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|... from start to finish. New appreciation for Ben Affleck. Will look for all of his movies from here on.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|One of the best Bond movies yet!<br />I loved it! It was thoughtful and took a few turns that I didn't see coming. Great fun!
1427210241|5.0|The final book of the series. The voices are awesome at doing different people, different dialects, different pitches. The only bad thing, is that this is the final book. I'm sad to see it end, but it ends amazingly. I'm already going the the series a second time since this came out in January (I'm on book 8). This is such a great series with so many different characters, cultures, personality, conflicts. The claims that Robert Jordan created a sexist world is silly, because for every culture, there is another on the opposite end of the spectrum.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I enjoyed this book greatly.  It keeps your attention all the way and keeps you thinking.  A great book for anyone looking for a great action book but make sure you read the first one.
B004PGAQMW|5.0|This was pure entertainment, for children and adults. It was very upbeat and you were happy at the end of the movie
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|An excellent book for those of us that appreciate the sacrifice our military makes every day. Author shows both the human side and warrior side of our men and women in uniform. Thank you Amazon for having this in Kindle version.
B001UN1KVE|2.0|I thought this movie was funny as a kid, now that I'm older it isn't really all that funny, just very vulgar
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris Kyle was the ultimate, modern American hero. This novel brings out the very human side of Chris, his wife, and children. It also clearly, without being gory or sensational, brings out the warrior that protected our troops, his teammates, and American freedom. His recent, untimely death has shaken many of us to the core and America has lost a treasure. God bless his family and memory. God bless America.
B000PMLFRA|4.0|This bundle is a great price. The blu ray is great to watch. My only complaint is that when they made the blu ray. version they decide to sneak in some phoney &#34; Men in Black&#34; type characters. Other than that it is a great set
B000YJ85BI|4.0|The Last Colony was a good read but not as great as Old Man's War. I read them back to back and was slightly disappointed with this one.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Such a good book! Almost couldn't put it down. Enjoyed reading it so much that I now can't wait for the movie.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|This is a great great show, great acting from the cast with stories that keep you interested to the next one.

B004DLPXAO|5.0|Although I do not have a Kindle, I buy books from Amazon which is a good source for almost any kind reading materials.  This app allows me to enjoy my HP-Touchpad  which also has a dual OS and in both OS I do enjoy the reading of my preferred books. This application is in itself a must for individuals who have a large collection of books from Amazonj and wish to access them at any given time.
0425220931|5.0|This book was truly eye opening. This has been a game changer for me as a musician. Sometimes a shift in perception and awareness is all that is needed to let the truth come forward. Could not put this one down. Want to read it again. I hope I get to meet Victor Wooten one of these days and just shake the guy's hand and thank him for writing this book.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game! I have a kindle fire he and the graphics are pretty nice. And the gameplay is pretty smooth
B000QGAU4E|5.0|This movie is disturbing, thought provoking, and amazing. I, personally, loved it. It's def a little heavy so beware if you're not in the mood for that sort of thing.
0143036424|5.0|After thoroughly enjoying the new TV series, LONGMIRE, I though I should begin reading the books.  Great move on my part.  The descriptions and characterizations are outstanding in Johnson's book.  There is also a humorous side of Johnson's writing that seems to be specific to the book because there are no time constraints, as with TV.<br /><br /> Sheriff Longmire has been enjoying lazy days in the Wyoming frontier, with very little to push him into duty.  He's even contemplating retirement, and hoping that his brash young deputy from Philadelphia, Victoria, would be elected as the new sheriff.  He enjoys times with his friend Harry Standing Bull, and has gotten comfortable with his always honest and opinionated receptionist, Ruby.  Keeping a couple of his other deputies in line is less enjoyable. And relations between the Native Indians on the reservation territory, and the remaining population, often takes some diplomacy.<br /><br />All this is rudely disrupted when a dead body is found in Longmire's territory.  This was assumed to probably be from an accident until another dead body is found.  These two men had been part of a foursome who raped a fetal alcohol syndrome young women ten years ago.  Because they were young, and presumably because it was a white on Native Indian crime, and there was a question of the 'knowledgeability' of the girl, the boys had been given a suspended sentence.  Longmire suspects that these may be revenge murders, but wonders why the ten year wait.<br /><br />The story line is suspenseful; pertinent to racial and disability issues; full of striking banter; and descriptive to a certain local.  This book is, hopefully, the beginning of great added pleasure to the LONGMIRE TV show that prompted me read the originals in the first place!!!
B001BR5NN0|5.0|This is just one of the best &#34;coming of age&#34; movies ever made. It is almost 30 years old and somehow, someway, still totally relevant. That's why it's a classic.
B003YV64OI|5.0|Don't let the price fool you as it almost did me, I got one of these for a customer on a budget and was so impressed I ended up building 3 more systems with it, its truly a fast chip even if you don't luck out and get an unlockable core. I even have my youngest boy gaming on one of these, his 2.8Ghz Phenom II quad system had the board fail and I handed him this in a unit I had built to keep as a spare while he waited for his new board. Well after 3 days he said \\"Don't bother, I like this one better\\" no doubt do to the faster clocks being worth more than L3 cache in games.<br /><br /> He has been slamming it hard for nearly 4 months and its whisper quiet, doesn't choke no matter how much he throws at it, and paired with an HD4830 graphics card tears through the latest MMOs with ease and again that is WITHOUT unlocking the fourth core as the budget board I had bought didn't have core unlock! All in all its a great chip and if it'll handle the latest games like MMOs I'm sure it'll handle anything, and for less than a hundred bucks? its a steal, grab it while you can!
0618918248|5.0|I found this book to be full of little thoughts that I'd had all throughout my life but never really took the time to articulate or discuss with others. The book can be a little repetitive because Dawkins goes into great detail and explores many lengthy anecdotes.
B005HSL626|4.0|My daughter makes hilarious noises when playing this game as she chops the fruit. I think I am having more fun than she is
B00012QM8G|5.0|The soundtrack is awesome and so is the cinematography in this movie. The movie really could have been about anything and it would have been awesome with these two elements, but the subject matter pushes it high, high intro the stratosphere.

B001O3UJ8K|5.0|Once you're a fan of a band, can you really give one of their albums less than 5-stars? Not my favorite album but definitely worth adding to the collection if you're a Trent Reznor fan.

B005G5PPGS|4.0|It's a good read but there are a lot of terms in here that the reader is expected to know.. If you've never followed baseball, that's going to be a challenge. But all in all, as with the blind side, the book is more informative and better entertainment that the movie
B00136NYB2|5.0|This has most of the great Elvis songs you'd expect from a number one album but leaves out a few of the classics you might want.

B000TDIE6A|5.0|One of the few somewhat recent albums (I usually listen to classic rock) that I immediately enjoyed. This one is staying in the iTunes library for some time to come.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|LOOPER is dark, dull and depressing. I watched it on Netflix but since Amazon is where I do (occasional) reviews, this is where I'll put my two cents. The film has received a lot of positive ratings, which I can't figure out. There isn't much to like here. The \\"Sci-Fi\\" element certainly isn't new - time travelling to kill people was exhaustively explored in the Terminator franchise. There is an irrelevant sidelight involving telekenesis, which has nothing to do with the story and seems really dated and lame (think The Exorcist from 1973)...the bad guys wear long black coats straight out of The Matrix....and the main characters are cold blooded killers. Many gratuitous, repetitive shots of people being blown away with shotguns. The editing seems sloppy so there isn't so much dramatic tension as hope for something that never materializes. A movie that never should have been made.
B00569LSUG|5.0|New music with a real retro vibe. Recommended for anyone looking to break out of the old classic rock genre and start listening to some more current music.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book. I can't wait to see the movie now. The author did an amazing job telling this story!!!
B00136JRZY|5.0|I bought this album after watching American Psycho, but I have to say, I think I like this album even more than the movie now. I've listened to this album a good 30+ times in the past 4 months and can't get enough.
B006G3JQ78|5.0|one of the best kids / family movies of all time.  Full of imagination and music.  The kids will love it!
B002RV01QI|5.0|This isn't just the very best of Enya, this is the very best of music ever. Enya is the greatest.
B003ZJJFKE|5.0|Great release, one of my favs, and I have all of them, Joe has been jammin' since the 80's, he's still got it.  Rock on Joe!
888370536X|4.0|Nice little notebook for doing doodles or scribbling stuff. Probably better to take notes on a phone or use a computer though.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|&#34;I am bad and that's good. I will never be good and that's not bad. There's no one I'd rather be than me.&#34;<br /><br />Funny and enjoyable.
B006P8KKYW|5.0|Some of the best music I've listened to in years. I highly recommend becoming familiar with this album before you associations any of the sounds with the movie. If you've already seen the movie, no worries, but give it a try if you haven't.<br /><br />If you like this album check out Peter Gabriel's &#34;Passion of the Christ&#34; and do the same thing. Listen to the music first and then check out the movie if you must. Let your mind make an entirely new movie.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|OK, love this app.<br />Really good.  Plenty of fun. No trouble, easy and lots of enjoyment. Doesn't need any more words. 'Nuff said.
B000VZJUGY|5.0|This was my second NIN album purchase but probably the most classic and recognizable NIN album (from what I've seen). Has such tracks as &#34;hurt&#34; and &#34;closer.&#34;
B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|David Bowie's first album in ten years has many great tracks! I have listened to the album three times now an all I can say is wow,<br />I have loved almost every song on this album.In The Next Day, Bowie has implanted nods to his past in some songs, and all I can really say is I love the album and HIGHLY recommend it! Even the bonus tracks are great, I love &#34;I'll Take You There!&#34;
B000V674P2|5.0|A classic album that every GOD fan should own. Check this out and get some Cream albums to go along with it!
1577314808|5.0|TThe book arrived in the mail quickly. I'm well pleaded with the book it's a good read that for a great price!
B000WCBMA8|5.0|This band is truly wonderful. I have another CD of theirs, but this one is by far the best in my opinion.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|It was interesting. Graphics were good and music was a good choice for a creepy feel. Would love it if the whole game was free.
1401216676|5.0|Who doesn't love Batman? And who isn't at least intrigued by the Joker? This sheds some light on the psychotic Clown Price of Crime.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Katniss with her comrades continues to battle the Capital and President Snow. It's not enough to survive just the Hunger Games; you have to survive the aftermath as well. Who can you trust? Who will understand and comfort you?
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This movie is one of Disney's most classical films to date, in my opinion. I always cry whenever I watch this movie, and that means that it's still as heart warming as it was when it first came out.
B00015YVD6|5.0|A real great blast from the past. Was so happy I found this so easy and one click purchased had it two days later! Perfect!
6305949980|5.0|This is my all time favorite movie above any and all else. It's stop motion and about Halloween. What's not to love?!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|I love all of Sophie Kinsella's books but this has to be my favorite. Such a sweet story, and a worth while read.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|Who doesn't love Disney movies, especially the ones from the 80's and 90's? This one is a great classic and it still makes me cry to this day.
B0084B5TK8|4.0|I kindof picked this book up on a wim. I am glad that I did because it has kept me on the edge of my seat while I have read it. Funny thing isI know the story and how it ends but enjoyed reading it.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|The Broadway musical was dark and wonderful and the film version of it is just as great. Johnny Depp's singing voice brought a creepier edge to the film, which was perfect for it.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|The grandkids love this game and I love it when they need to be quiet. I use my Kindle for every thing and that includes entertaining the grandkids
B00003CXB4|5.0|Disney has many classics, but this one is at the top of the list, if not the number one classic.
B007ZTLLMK|5.0|this is a fun time killer and I mean I can kill time. I am not a very good gamer but I like this one since it is within my interest
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I don't like zombie movies, but I freaking love this series. It's not about the zombies, people; it's about the characters and how they survive in this zombie infested world! Plus - SPOILERS - Shane dies and that was good news for me!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a game that I can always count on to be the BEST game EVER in the whole world!!!!!!!!
B006Q1SQCQ|5.0|This is working for me. Tried the techniques in the The Memory Book, seen improvements that are still working even week later. I like this book and will continue to use the this guide the rest of my life.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is awesome.You get to buy powerups and mystery boxes at the store. You even win trophies and free mystery boxes.I really recommend this game.
1881273873|5.0|This is a very good book on relationships for singles in all of their relationships, not just dating.  There are good questions to ask oneself at the end of each chapter, and a test to discover one's primary love language.  I heartily recommend this book.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I read Ms. Moyes' previous book, The Last Letter From Your Lover, and really enjoyed it so I was excited to see that she had a new book available. It was such a tender, poignant novel, I experienced the emotions right along with the heroine! You will be rooting for each character in the novel at one point or another. Well done and thank you, Ms. Moyes- I hope to be reading a new novel of yours soon!
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Great blu ray to own for serious TV collector. This is a must have if you are an avid fan.
160094048X|5.0|As a vegan in the not-so-vegan-friendly Midwest, I've developed a reputation for my excellent cookies, even though everyone knows they're vegan (and otherwise makes fun of me.) I have had this book for over a year and I've tried maybe 2/3rds of the recipes in that time, and there are no misses--even the carob cookies are delicious! This is a wonderful, easy-to-follow book with lots of pictures and funny tidbits from the authors. Love them! Full disclosure: I buy every cookbook by Isa Chandra Moskowitz and I am having a tough time waiting for her newest--Isa Does It--to come out.
B0001AP13A|1.0|I ordered this album about a month ago.  After waiting about ten days for it to show up, I was excited when it actually arrived.  From the start I thought things would be great. It was in a new package. I had to unwrap it myself so I was already thinking everything was going to be great.  The vinyl seemed okay. However, that's where all the good things about this end.  After opening it and playing it for the very first time - I came to realize that every song on the album skipped and was practically impossible to listen to.  I thought maybe it was the needle on my player at first, but after cleaning everything and wiping down the vinyl - no improvement was made.  I then tried to contact the seller about how upset I was over buying something that completely didn't work, but I've waited for over a week and have gotten no response from anyone - apart from an automated machine that told me on March 7th they'd be in contact with me in 48 hours.  It's not March 12, and not one person has contacted me. This album is one of my favorites and I'm very sad that I purchased one that basically doesn't work.  I'll never buy from this company again and I suggest no one else out there does either.  Worst company ever.  What a waste of money.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|its awesome! I love to draw so I needed to get this app. if your bored just play with this its epic!
B007GFDVEE|5.0|Sturdy, durable and creative - this Captain America Lego is a great find. I love that they have included several other materials; not just plain Captain America. The bike, the soldiers and the other small gadgets make this toy a total good buy. My son loves them after watching the movie he is always playing with them
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love hidden objects game. There are very relaxing to me. My boy like this game. They are good at finding the objects.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I sincerely hoped that there would have  been a better ending. Now I'm left craving more of fifty shades-just like Ana.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The service was outstanding very efficient and exactly as prescribed very easy to complete the transaction will be definitely coin business in the future you should too
B0058Z4NR8|4.0|This book is a start. How do we stop trying to implement socialism? The number who died in the twentieth century as a direct result of trying to make socialism work should preclude further attempts.
0345803485|1.0|Despite being the same age, living in the same area and even sharing the same last name as the main character I could not connect with her, I thought she was very boring and unrelateable. I only read until about page 50 and I don't think I can finish. I am already annoyed with the mention on almost every page about her &#34;flushing&#34; (apparently the britsh word for blush). She is a college student but I felt like she was in high school. Let's face it... being a 21 year old virgin is pushing it on being believable but never even holding hands or feeling attracted to someone before him? What has she been living under a rock her whole life? and from reading other reviews apparently she has never had an email address before, Seriously? This book is a mess I have no idea how it has so many 5 stars or even 3 or 4 stars. it's just terrible and I regret wasting my money on it. I think the only ones who would like this book are teenagers.
B0072NWJRK|3.0|I do not like the murder/mystery genre; I read the book to get a feel for what life in Peking was like as the Chinese government pulled back and the Japanese army advanced. The author told the story very well.
B0063M22QO|5.0|All the apps I've purchased have been great I<br /><br /> have yet to be dissatisfied with my choices. Please keep them coming.<br />heidrickg@yahoo.com
B002MQYOFW|3.0|Character development was about as thorough as one could expect given the intended audience. I felt manipulated at the end of the book. The book was much better than the movie.
1451683405|2.0|If you like philosophy (circular reasoning and more circular reasoning) then you'll like this book.  But if you believe that the God of justice gave everyone a choice about their own personal eternal destiny, you sure won't like this book.  Sam sounds like the typical Calvinist, a man who likes to take full control of the choices of others and leave them with no choice of their own.  Hence, his ideas don't make a lot of sense to a person with a good sense of justice.  This book was basically a waste of time.
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|First, New Line, you lost yet another sale because of your stupid decision to support Ultraviolet exclusively. If you want to support UV, fine, but you need to support Digital Copy as well if you ever expect to see another dime from me.<br /><br />The decision not to purchase was made all the easier by the fact that \\"The Hobbit\\", while a good movie, is not a compelling as \\"The Lord of the Rings\\". I saw each of the the three LOTR movie several times in the theater, but I only felt compelled to watch \\"The Hobbit\\" the one time. To be clear, Martin Freeman is absolutely brilliant as Bilbo, but the tone of the movie is all over the place. Much of that problem flows directly from the source material (The Hobbit is much lighter and sillier than LOTR), but I fault the screenwriters with failing to come up with a more consistent tone for the script.<br /><br />Given the \\"so so\\" impression the movie made on me, the lack of extras (New Line loves to double- and even triple-dip), and their pig-headed support for Ultraviolet, I suggest you simply take a pass on purchasing \\"The Hobbit\\" and rent it instead.<br /><br />Score: 3 stars for the movie and lose two stars, one each because of Ultraviolet and for de minimis extras, for a total of 1 star.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|It was great! My son loved it! What a timeless story that never grows old. Maybe even better than the movie... maybe?
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is a great game for all the horse lover's like me.I love this game because it teachs u how to take care or your horse and all that.
B002361MLA|5.0|A must for everyone to read. The best book I've read in years, despite reading it over 8 years ago. Its the type of book you can read again and again.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Downton Abbey is a wonderful series. The characters are genuine and well thought out. I feel that it is a true representation of what life was like then and I look forward to many more seasons.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a surprisingly strong follow-up to the Hunger Games novel. A few unexpected twists but a little too heavy on the love triangle. Still, a very good read and I can't wait to read the conclusion: Mockingjay.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is super fun and makes you wanna keep playing and coming back for more. I love how the makers update it often changing from place to place. this game is a must have. So fun. Keeps me occupied. Also, its really cool to sign in with facebook to compete against your friends and try to beat their highscores. Time to download this one! Its an amazing offer.
B00A4Y9BT8|5.0|I bought this because I love RATM, and the price for the MP3 album was unbeatable (2.99). This really is a landmark album from the 1990s and should be in any hard rock music fan's library.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|funny funny funny is a must see .if you like too laugh this is funny I liked it so kick back & enjoy..
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This took me a while to read, but once I took the time to read I enjoyed it fully. Very good book and now I can't wait to see the movie soon.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I loved the suspense and to trying to figure out who did what. I had to read all of the books and the girl that played Liz
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|The treatment of orphan children in this story makes it difficult to read, but the imagery and characters (for the most part) were delightful and I couldn't put it down. I gave this book four stars just because it is tough to read knowing that the abuse described was based in reality. The end brought me to tears...Overall a good read!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I never expected to read this series due to the theme of innocent children killing one another for entertainment. My friend decided that I needed to watch the movie so I did. I found the movie intriguing. I admit that I was too quick to judge because once I started to read each book, I just couldn't put it down. The Hunger Games Trilogy is now one of my favorite book series. It's a must read series. This series has everything that you want in a book: action, suspense, love, betrayal, and so much more. I do recommend this series to everyone.
B000QCS8TW|2.0|I am on the 3rd book of this saga and am about to quit. Too many people and plots to follow! And I got through Cryptonomicon w/ endless plots. I find myself suddenly thrown into a family of people who it seems the authors just figured out he needs to complete a certain part of this saga. It's as though-Oh wait-I need to explain this somehow, so let's throw in more people. The names are superfluous and endless. There are actually only about 5 families this author need keep you current on. Still, after 3 books I am finding myself suddenly introduced to new characters that seem to be important to???? Nothing. Other than to continue sucking you further in and buying more books.I am finding myself caring less and less who the heck wins.I cannot keep track of all the names-long names with titles and fragmented attachments to the plots. What seems to be happening to me is I am getting tired of this authors lack of an outline. I am wondering if he wrote one and am answering myself NO. Not when some great knight that has never been mentioned before is suddenly thrown into the midst of a battle that rests with his victory simply so the story can go on & on & on. It seems an exercise in confusion and frustration. I would say I have been asked to remember over 30 names with tiles and all their kids only to have them not necessary to the main plot. If the author is trying to sell a lot of books he has succeeded. I believe it could have been written one volume. And unless you care what every one is wearing and what fabric/ metal it is and what the embroidery looks like, the clothing description is just a waste of good space. Big disappointment-no-but sick of what people who are going to be killed are wearing is just not my thing.
B007SGM084|5.0|Great book loved every minute of it I wish there was more to it though I was very sad it ended
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Kept me watching from beginning to end.<br />Love the catwoman and batman scenes.<br />Like the new robin intro for the next film.<br />Good Flick. Good work Mr. Nolan.
0062012339|4.0|Althought this book wasn't one that kept me up late, I very much enjoyed the read. I really liked the different viewpoints of each member and the way they were arranged. Some incidents were looked at in extremely different ways buy a number of people. If you are offended by sex, drugs and language then this isn't the book for you. If you are looking for a window into the glam rock of the Crue then read away!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Love the app it takes me back! I would have given it a five star rating but it's too easy! Love it!
B00005N6KG|4.0|These are great for running! They stay on nice and tight. The downside is that they don't last. I have to buy a new pair every 6 months or so.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book is so captivating! It makes you wonder what you would do in the same situation. E L James has such a way of describing every last detail, and it helps create a world that you feel a part of. I would love her to write a book from the doms perspective though!! I finished this series over a week ago, and I have since started many other books. Unfortunately, nothing is as captivating. I am stuck bookless for now. Perhaps I will read them over ;)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this app is amazing! I love the easy to use games!! I give this 5 stars. my horse is the best!
B0070Y46UY|1.0|I could not not get into this book. I read the first few chapters, and I had no motivation to continue. Maybe if I kept reading, then I would have gotten into it, but I just couldn't.
B001EZ2T7W|5.0|The Stargate movies expand and complete specific episodes or plot-lines that couldn't be finished within the regular run of the series.<br /><br />So, if you are a follower of the series, you will want to at least view these offerings.<br /><br />And if like me, you have the SG series in your series library, you will want to complete your library with these additions.
B00BBQXQFI|5.0|Pros:<br />Great movie more original than most holiday movies.<br />A holiday movie that you can watch more than once a year and still enjoy it.<br />Cons:<br />A bit scary for younger children.
B001EN71CW|5.0|If you have enjoyed the series in the past, there is nothing further need be said. If you haven't had the opportunity to view any of the series, this is a series that you will want to re-visit periodically, and complete with the addition of Serenity.<br /><br />I find the best written sci-fi series don't always keep the interest and funding of producers, unfortunately. This is one such series.<br /><br />However, owning the series and including in my library collection offers me the ample opportunities to watch the entire series at leisure.<br /><br />If you are a sci-fi aficionado, this is likely to become a treasured part of your library as it has become in  mine.
B00AX7PGQS|2.0|This film is very ambitious, and probably aspires to be a surreal masterpiece. I found it to be turgid claptrap. Granted, the acting is occasionally excellent, some of the situations are comedic, and there are incidences of philosophical issues being raised. However, it is not engaging and just gets less interesting with each passing minute. I suspect that the only people who might enjoy this film would be pretentious postmodernists.
B003O86FMW|5.0|These books sucked me in and I couldn't put htem down. I bought and read them all on my vacation last summer. They totally drew me in.
0307361012|3.0|I've read a thousand reviews saying this isn't Nesbo's best and that the series gets insanely better, so I soldiered on and finished it, admittedly skimming a little. I give any book credit that can reveal a killer before I've guessed who it is, but getting through the plot was slightly tiresome. Also, the endless Aboriginal stories should have been cut all together. They had absolutely no point to the storyline. An extra star for the Australian setting (loved the Aussie slang.) This wasn't fantastic but also not terrible. I'll give the next book a go.
B003UBTX6S|3.0|Easy and quick to read. Kind of like Twilight written from a boy's perspective. It was a good guilty pleasure.
B005BOHYW2|4.0|What a great book. I read it in a day.  I simply just could not put it down. The language of flowers has opened up a whole new world to me.
0802473156|5.0|My husband and I of 16 years read this book recently and I really am amazed that the simple concept of understanding where your spouse is coming from ( you know speaking their love language) would help make life sooo much nicer. I am an acts of service/quality time person and He is an words of affirmation  Just knowing these things and following through as the book describes we have had so much less strife in our house . And he actually helps with the house without me asking  Love it  read this book and hand it out to everyone in Love
B00351YEZS|5.0|General relativity and quantum mechanics are not easy subjects to fully comprehend (at least for me they're not), but they are fundamental to understanding everyday life events that occur around us.  Stephen Hawking has the knack of explaining these laws of nature in such a way that lay people are able to gain some level of understanding.  I also love the way he uses simple analogies, sometimes with entertaining humour, to illustrate scientific principles.  However be warned, this is a book that will need to be read more than once (it's not very long though) to digest and comprehend complex scientific laws and principles.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Written well, easy read, story line moves along well.  Really makes you admire the courage of this woman and gives some insight into the mind of the guy who pursues her.  I will pay to see the movie for sure.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|this game is really fun. I hope that there will be different levels and things you can draw along the way of its progress in updates. this game has its own unique style of gaming and could be revolutionary fr tablet games and other touch screen devices.  keep up the good work&hellip;you have my support all the way!! :)
B00846REIS|1.0|If you like a ton of explicit, descriptive sex, this ones for you, very little plot, not my kind of read!
0062082353|5.0|Too bad I came to hear about it as a result of the authors death. Good to know we have men like this protecting our Country.
B0058VW36U|4.0|Make sure you have the parental controls set on your device for this one as it is always recommending purchasing help, which translates into $$$.  Fun to play for kids or adults, yeah kind of addicting too.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I love fantasy,these books are well thought out and interesting.  I read very quickly so I can't wait for the next one!  As you follow alone with the main characters finding out more about them, it kept me up late reading.
B00957T6X6|2.0|The first three books kept me on the edge of my chair.  I don’t remember too many books that grabbed my attention and held it as much as the first three books.  There were so many characters that you were excited about an wanted to know more about.  Then nothing.  They don’t hardly get mentioned.  A whole new set of characters you care a whole lot less about for two long books.  I really don’t know what happened with this guy.  Maybe he’ll bring it all together later on but I won’t know.  I’m done.  Really disappointing.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|Very enjoyable... and feel good movie in a different way. Not your usual chick-flick. Great acting with very witty screenplay.
B00005N6KG|5.0|I didn't buy these from Amazon, I got them back in the day with my Sony cd Walkman.  I've owned these for over 20 years!  Yes, 20!  They are still going strong.  Great for any type of exercise or movement.  Would highly recommend!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Charlie is hardly an Everyman, but he suffers greatly under his learning and coping differences.  It's a great book for getting the discussion going about a wide range of subjects from feeling an outsider, to feelings of bing harmed by the adults in your life.  It's a very good &#34;born this way&#34; footnote, it should be helpful to teens and pre-teens for getting the spleen vented and the boils lanced.  And as a parent, it feels about right for looking under the hood at the condition of adolescence from a perspective not in the engine room.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I love this app because when I hav to wake up for school I need  to be ther on tim
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book was very long but it's was worth it to sit and read. It was interesting. You would just keep thinking about what would happen next. It's sad and a tad bit confusing but everything all comes together at the end. The novel also has high vocabulary and skills you might need to know. I would recommend adolescents and older to read this book.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Nice movie. Some of the characters were a little modern acting for the time and setting but I still enjoyed it.
0807014273|4.0|Not only do we get a first person account of life in Auschwitz during WWII, but we get it from a person trained in psychiatry and developing already upon theories that will become the foundation of logotherapy and existentialism. Through his narration of the inhumane living in a concentration camp, my heart broke a few times, but his unique perspective helped me find a meaning, in a meaningless situation. It's actually not the \\"meaning\\" of why concentration camps even existed or why WWII even took place, or why some human looking beings could be so uncaring, sadistic and without conscience when inflicting horrific suffering against other humans (today they are called psychopaths and inflict suffering over the rest of us from various positions of power). What he talks about is the Meaning that one can find even in situations so horrible as he has suffered, the responsibility of a human to make the most of that suffering, to use it as a means of becoming a better human being.<br /><br />Perhaps Frankl does not know it himself, but what he describes in his narration of the \\"apathy\\" that many of his fellow inmates fell victims to, is the process of ponerization, where a human being loses their humanity when exposed repeatedly to inhumanity and cruelty. It is also interesting that the capos, who were prisoners themselves yet in put in charge of other prisoners, where chosen by the SS based on their character, and were often more sadistic and cruel against other prisoners than the German guards themselves. A survival of the heartless, especially if we account for Frankl's statement: \\"We who have come back, by the aid of many lucky chances or miracles-whatever one may choose to call them-we know: the best of us did not return\\". \\"The best of us\\", meaning those who were not prepared \\"to use every means, honest and otherwise, even brutal force, theft, and betrayal of their friends, in order to save themselves\\". In concentration camps, same as with the sociopolitical life in Europe at the time, the good people died first while the psychopaths got promoted. It does sound familiar to me today.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Not your typical Navy Seal book at all. It has such a strong spiritual message. Not what I expected at all. This will be mandatory reading for my whole family. My heart goes out to the Brown Family and the SEAL Community for their loss but I would like to thank them for allowing Adam's story to be told.
