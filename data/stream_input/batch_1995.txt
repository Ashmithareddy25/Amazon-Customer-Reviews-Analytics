B004QX07G4|2.0|I really like Ellen, but didn't really like this book.  It was kind of funny, but seemed like she just sat down one day and said I'm going to write a book one day and just put a bunch of random ideas on paper.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It's addictive. Lot's of fun when you have time to kill waiting for an appointment or just need quiet time
B002MQYOFW|5.0|When I first started reading this I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to get into it, after all I only bought it because I heard so much hype about it. Two chapters in I almost quit, but after the third chapter I was hooked. Finished it in one day. Loved it and can't wait to start book 2. The authors imagination is amazing beyond belief it was like I was there, I was able to picture everything so vividly.
B005VPRDAY|5.0|We purchased this lego set for our 4 year old daughter.  This is her first set of legos and she loves all the cute little parts.  We plan on adding more legos sets to her toy box.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Excellent cast, touching story and the Academy felt it worthy of recognition.  Dame Judi Dench and Dame Maggie Smith are outstanding in their roles.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down. Absolutely had to know what was going to happen next. I literally felt like I was Sky walking around with my stomach always in knots!
B002QE3CTY|4.0|A little slow to start, but a very good read, I'm ready for the next one.  I would highly recommend this book for a high school book club!
B0017SWSCW|5.0|I could not put this book down.  A real page turner and very intriguing.  I'm ready to buy the next one.
B00417HV14|5.0|Just one of the best concerts you could ever watch!!!!  Joe Bonamassa is one of the best blues artist ever!  And, not only do you see him perform but artists like Eric Clapton, Beth Hart and others join him on stage!  By far one of the best shows ever!!!  You really shouldn't miss this one!!  (And, definitely more affordable through Amazon than anywhere I've looked)
B00001ODGR|5.0|very energetic, professional show. Includes Dennis DeYoung too. I highly recommend this Styx fans or to any music fan in general
B0074JOCIG|5.0|I've seen Joe Bonamassa in concert and he is by far one of the best live shows you could ever see.  This concert on DVD truly captures how great an artist he really is, and features some of the best artists in the business on stage with him.<br />If you like the Blues, then you'll love JB and completely enjoy this concert!  Plus, through Amazon it's definitely cheaper than getting the DVD elsewhere.
B0094KT8W8|5.0|This is not a great film, and I must confess, I was not a fan of the original.  But it truly is one of the COOLEST science-fiction movies of all time (the music, the costumes, the amazing looking world).  It should appeal to most sci-fi fans.  If you like it, I recommend you also check-out the cartoon on the Disney Channel (TRON: Uprising).<br /><br />Ironically, I felt similarly about it's video game (TRON: Evolution).  It's not a great game -- but it's super-cool!
0765325950|5.0|Just finished my first read of this book.  I've been reading the series for many years now, and this book was great closure for what has been a fun ride.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I absolutely love this book. It is so romantic yet a little crazy with the sex acts that is very wild.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great app!  The tap feature is great. I really love that the four suit setting is so challenging.  A word of warning - highly addictive!
B009NPKTN6|2.0|Movie had poor acting and I was not expecting all the singing. Just not what I expected. This is definitely a rent or free movie.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Unusual amount of humor in an essential hard SF survival story. Good story, especially for the price. Changes in point of view awkward.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Amazing book. Could not stop reading it! Can't wait for the second one! Kept you at the end. Of your seat!
B000PFU7OO|5.0|After viewing this exceptional film a number of times (primarily due to my wife's adoration for it), my wife showed interest in the soundtrack. I have to admit, this is easily one of the best albums I have ever listened to - and I don't say that about ANY music.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The racketeering is an excellent book about law and corruption.  The book is also an excellent mystery. The author is as good as they get.
B0010AN7Z4|5.0|Billy Wilder broke the mold when he made this film. It's perfect in every way and has to be one of the best films ever made, in fact. My wife had never seen it and we watched it during the Christmas season this year (any who have seen this know it takes place over the holidays). This is easily one of my favorite films and makes my holiday list, as well.
B006LSZECO|5.0|The roller coaster of emotion this story brings out in a reader is a wonderful ride! Don't miss out on it!
B002BJGYTY|4.0|Actually, my wife is the one who loves this (however, I really like it, too). She had fond memories of this one back in college (I think it was then) and talked about those days enough for me to move forward with these. Every season only pushes her forward that much quickly (she knocks these out in a few nights). Season three is nearly the best of the series (following only season one for greatness), after a bit of a dip in the second season, with Rory starting to move on with her life, as her time at Chilton comes to a close. This is by far some of her best moments (outside of the real drama in season six). One of the series' best episodes, &#34;They Shoot Gilmores, Don't They?&#34;, is here and &#34;That'll Do Pig&#34; is a good one, too (always thought Marion Ross' &#34;Trix&#34; and Dean's sister, Clara, were good comedy relief). A dramatic turn in Lorelai & Sookie's Independence-Dragonfly Inn situation occurs and Rory's college plans ... may not be Harvard???
B000HEWEJO|5.0|Pretty much, yes, this is the best Christmas film. There just really is no topping it, for all its perfection. For one, Christmas films have gone to pot in the modern age. There really are no decent ones, even, least of all classics. Even the 90s adaptation of 'Miracle on 34th Street&#34; was just a poor copy of the original (which is not even an astounding film, in itself!)  My wife and I both like two James Stewart Christmas films - this one and &#34;The Shop Around the Corner&#34; - and the 1994 version of &#34;Little Women&#34;. Outside of that, she really likes the TV debut of the Waltons entitled &#34;The Homecoming&#34; and I have fond memories of the Rankin/Bass TV specials. But this movie here is still the one.
B002BJGYU8|3.0|Wife loves the series and I find myself enjoying them, as well. A valuable lesson I learned in comparing these first two seasons is that the show is best as a warm, comfortable cup of hot cocoa ... with a dash of screwball comedy. This second season starts to lean more on the drama, which I find to be not one of the show's best attributes and, thus, this season is not as much of a favorite. However, since the earliest parts of the show are easily the best, I'd rate this as third place, still, behind one and three. Rory visits the Harvard campus and finds the new mysterious boy to be a little interesting, her grandfather feels he's being phased out of his career, Lane falls in love with the drums, Lorelai graduates from business school and gets mixed up over men, and throughout all of this are preparations for Sookie and Jackson's big day. Some fun moments include Bid-a-Basket, Lorelai and Emily's spa trip, and the Bracebridge dinner.
B000AGTPUK|3.0|My wife really liked this film when she saw it in the theatre. It made her feel like she was &#34;on the train&#34;. With that said, I'm not really a fan of CGI and especially NOT 3D (I remember seeing some of the 50s rebroadcasts and when they attempted to bring 3D back when I was a kid, as well). However, I will say that the story is likable enough, but not because of Tom Hanks (who I really don't like here), but more due to the kids. But the most important part, the story, is lacking.
B002BJGYUS|5.0|My wife adores the series and I like it, too. She'd seen this back in college and talked about it for some time, so I took a chance ... and it payed off! One of her utmost favorites! The thing that really makes the series is the measure of just how much the viewer wishes they were part of Stars Hollow. I'm one of those who - in the first few seasons, anyway - wished such. Now, although I feel it never surpasses the energy and vibe of season one, the series holds up well nearly throughout its whole seven year run. With it being a dramedy, the balance is really best in its introduction. After this, the drama picks up some and, slowly, Stars Hollow becomes less and less charming and sweet over time. However, the next three years are still pretty strong (especially season three) - and if only season six could have held onto the brilliance it created during its first half. Whether you become a big fan or not, though, I feel anyone couldn't help loving season one. In this season, Rory starts dating and begins attending the very competitive Chilton, as her mother has boy problems of her own. Rory's time at Chilton, her grandparents, and Luke who runs the diner add some good drama, but &#34;Rory's Birthday Parties&#34; proves just how much fun Stars Hollow can be.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|I recall really liking this back in the early 90s. In fact, at the time, it made my top ten Christmas film list. Boy, does reviewing previous reviews make a dif! My wife liked this one, too, so we added it to one of our yearly Christmas film purchases (we pickup a few each year) and where it's definitely entertaining and Michael Caine does a very good job as Ebenezer Scrooge, this is just one more decent filmed version of Charles Dickens' story \\"A Christmas Carol\\", along with the 1970 musical version \\"Scrooge\\", the 1938 MGM version, and 1969 Hanna-Barbera Australian animated TV version. However, these are all heads and shoulders over the recent Disney \\"animated\\" version, with Jim Carrey (awful!) and the other Disney short, \\"Mickey's Christmas Carol\\" (below average), not to mention the overbearing \\"Scrooged\\" with Bill Murray. It's worth adding to our collection (if nothing else, the menu, with Kermit, cracks us up). But I find, as I age, I have less and less interest in Jim Henson. I grew up with the original Sesame Street on TV and was a preteen when 'The Muppet Show' debuted, as well. Perhaps these are better for adolescents? Looking for a good version of Scrooge? Look no further than the 1951 British version, with plenty of atmosphere and shot in beautiful black and white. There's a beautiful animated short by Richard Williams also, from '71, which offers some extremely mysterious animation techniques. Very impressive, but not available on dvd, at least commercially.
B000HIVIOW|3.0|I recall seeing this some years ago on the Family Channel (along with what I assumed was the long lost Richard Williams short &#34;A Christmas Carol&#34;). I was touched by its simplicity and charm. It still holds up and I still love the theme song. However, the part of the film where the song is placed goes on far too long. Outside of this, my wife and I like this one.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was awesome. I liked the way Sparks almost made you feel bad for him and we knew it was just the alcohol talking. I love the way Jo was a part of the book. Let's see how they butcher the movie
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Did you not read the title? Need I say more? I am not getting paid to do this. Buy it.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|I'm not going to bother typing a synopsis of the film so here it is: this movie is sensitive, emotional, and intelligent. The way the director Greg Mottola arrives at this is by wit and then through that, laughs. Many of the employees at Adventureland are underemployed; they need to work at the park because of financial circumstances.<br /><br />Although the film isn't truly a comedy, there are jokes here and there, namely by Martin Starr's character, Joel. Nonetheless, these jokes are intelligent or at least leaves one in awe as we understand how vast their knowledge is.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game...lots of fun!  I recommend it to kindle users and any others who like to play a fun games.
0446547573|1.0|Hearing many good things about Sparks' books and needing a fun, mindless novel after several heavy non-fiction books in a row, I downloaded Safe Haven to my Kindle. I wanted to see what all the fuss was about. I mean, his books are bestsellers; millions of Americans can't be wrong, right?<br /><br />Oh, but can they. By page 20 I was already bored of the terribly tedious descriptions and pedestrian dialogue. Does it really benefit the story to describe every step of preparation when Katie cooks dinner for Alex? \\"Then she put the food in the refrigerator. After walking across the room, she decided to put the brie into the oven.\\" (I'm paraphrasing, but it really is that bad.) A third of the way through the book I was waiting for the moment when the CRAZY, EVIL ex-husband would try and find Katie in order to kill her. The stupid twist at the end was something I would have come up with in my high school creative writing class and it made me want to stomp on my Kindle and break it just to make this book disappear from my life forever.<br /><br />But the kicker for me was the BOOK DISCUSSION points at the end. What reading group is discussing this book? How could you possibly deconstruct a piece of \\"literature\\" this pedestrian? The only possible discussion you can do of this terrible book is to critique how one-dimensional the characters are, how predictable the plot is, how wooden the dialogue and prose is, and ponder the question of HOW ON EARTH THIS AUTHOR APPEALS TO THE MAJORITY OF THE BOOK-READING POPULATION.<br /><br />America, you deserve better. Go pick up a real book, because this is pure drivel.
B003SI9WYG|5.0|One of my all time favs.  Watch it again and again.  Simply amazing achievement in storytelling and creativity.  Definitely for the weird at heart.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|Utterly amazing in every way imaginable. There is nothing that I would have read and enjoyed more than this series
B00338QENI|5.0|Learning about HeLa cells for the first time was a revelation and truly beautiful account of what Henrietta Lack's family endured after the cells became available to science research.
0765325950|4.0|Is A Memory of Light everything we all wanted it to be? No, it's not. Would it have been better if it had another 1000 pages? Yes, it would. But it's still a good book. Finally we get closure on Rand's story. Parts of the book did feel a bit hurried, and there seemed to be some plot lines waylaid, but the book is still a great read. I know I'll be reading again, and again, and again. And I don't care what other people are saying, the ending was good, and I thought it was just perfect. Overall I recommend this book and the series.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book sucked me in quickly & kept me hooked!  LOVE the character developments! Secretly loved the villian & all of the crazy!
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|There are only 12 puzzles per layout and then it prompts you to purchase the full version.  Also, it remixes leftover pieces until you have won...so no losing.  No real challenge
0765325950|5.0|I loved the way the book tied together so many threads.  As always the scope of the world that was created was breathtaking!
B0067RQYNW|4.0|The app is pretty good and free office app it's my choice. How ever there are some annoying errors that make want to b search for a better one. I hope with further updates will solve them.

B00AYB20KI|2.0|I figured out the plot too quick. Old boring theam. Kill, Kill, Kill. Some nudity is the only thing that would have improved this movie.
0553805371|5.0|I bought the hard cover edition that is worth the money since the quality of the paper for the illustrations is superb! Great job to explain the topics in a simple way! You may be a scientist but if this is not your field you need some clarification! Fully recommended!

B007FEFLTO|4.0|Follet is always a page turning author, and this book has that in spades. It uses all the standard Follet tricks, but it's a fun read, and you'll probably learn a bit too. Maybe not his absolute best, but pretty close.

B009HQ9UHC|5.0|My 30 year old husband and 5 year old son BOTH love playing this game every chance they get. Too funny.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|This is the best knife ever. It looks great, but I like it better with the paint stripped off. Mine has lost its edge rather quickly, but I have heard that the sheath is to blame for that. I highly recommend this knife.
B003YL4L0W|4.0|LOVED THE ENDING! It made me cry! Its a very controversial book but it keeps you guessing with twists you don't expect! Some parts are annoying with religion being the main focus but otherwise really good!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|King deals with moral dilemma of going back in time for the soul purpose of saving an assassinated president. Hs descriptions are clear and accurately portray the U.S. in the 1960's. The only criticism I have is his method of dealing with sexual scenes. He really should leave them alone and let the reader's imagination (as he usually does) take the scene where they envision.<br /><br />He obviously did a lot of research on names and places. I found it clever that he used Arnett, Tx in the main character's travel (a la The Stand).<br /><br />Time travel is not an easy subject to make believable, but King masters this with the use of a simple storage room. Brilliant, I will re-read this many times.  I highly recommend this book even if this is your first introduction to Stephen King. If you have read other King books and been disappointed, you will be pleasantly surprised.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I had heard rave reviews of this book from friends.  Although I enjoyed it, I did not find it to be the page turner they described.  I found both main characters truly unlikable.  Worth reading though.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I honestly don't think anyone can read this book and not have it touch his/her life some way. I plan to give a copy to each student in my daughter's fifth grade class...it is that good and worth the read! August Pullman is a typical boy. He loves Star Wars, he has wicked video game skills, he's funny, he's goofy, and he worries about things sometime. He's really worried about fifth grade right now. He wants to be brave and just go for it, but something's holding him back...his face. August has always been different because of the facial deformity that makes him look, in his words, like a turtle. Because of his appearance, his parents have chosen to home school him, but now his mother feels he really needs to make his way in the world. His father is sure he will be \\"a lamb to slaughter\\", but gives in and lets August \\"Auggie Doggie\\" know that if things don't work out, he can always go back to being home schooled. The school does everything it can to help August make the transition. The headmaster invites a group of the best and brightest to meet with August before school even begins, so they at least will have recovered from the initial shock of his appearance and can be friendly and helpful. August is prepared for most of what the first real school day brings. He knows there will be shocked silence, staring, and perhaps even a bit of name calling or whispering and pointing. What he isn't prepared for is how much he cares, how much he wants to be a part of this new experience and succeed. Thanks to August's loving family, including a sister who is making her own way as she enters high school, and few students who actually do turn out to be good friends, August forges ahead and faces his worries and problems head-on. August grows from the experience, and you better believe that everyone who meets August and sees the boy behind that frightening face will be changed forever too.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|I read the whole thing in a day.  Anthony Bourdain has so many stories about the crazy stuff that happens behind the scenes in restaurants.  Most were drawn from his own experiences, but there are also useful tips you can use for your own dining experiences.  Don't get the seafood on Mondays.  Just don't.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|Greg Heffley begins this installment of the Diary of a Wimpy Kid series by reflecting on his birth and early childhood. All I can say is, \\"Poor kid!\\" From there, things seem to be going downhill fast, especially as Valentine's Day approaches and he tries to choose just the right person to be his date for the Valentine's Day dance.  He takes advice from his uncle, who is jobless and homeless, so he is flopping on the living room couch. The advice doesn't work as well as Greg hopes, but with a little Wimpy Kid luck, all will work out for Greg in the end. The most fascinating part of reading this book for me was the author's note where I learned that Jeff Kinney developed the Poptropica website. Cool points!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Not too bad a game. It has definitely. caught. my attention and I've been playing it a couple times a day.

B0083P1QUM|2.0|I miss the REAL Patricia Cornwell books.  The last two books could not be written by her there is soooo much description writing, I don't need to know every time she changes the blade in her scaple or every piece of clothing she is wearing.  Patricia please go back to your fully writing your books.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Had it not been for a mention on The Big Bang Theory chances are I never would have watched this show.  But one night while surfing Netflix I came across Firefly and remembered it was once talked about on Big Bang.  It was love at first sight.  I write this review with my Jayne Cobb hat on my head.  There is only one (in my opinion) bad episode and my only gripe is that on the streaming episodes each started with a voiceover of what Firefly was all about.  It's not on the Blu-ray.  The shows look great and I look forward to watching each episode over and over.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It is well written.Funny and sad at once.Would recommend to anybody at any ages.<br />Thought that the book is to young for me,but it is fantastic.

B005LAII80|4.0|Mega-City One: a vast metropolis of 800 million people stretching along the Eastern Seaboard of North America and a safe refuge from the radiation-ravaged Cursed Earth beyond. Fifteen thousand crimes take place daily in this huge city and only the men and women known as Judges - law-enforcement officers who summarily evaluate crimes and dispense sentences - can try to keep the peace.<br /><br />Cassandra Anderson is a new recruit to the Judges who has already failed one evaluation. She has been given a second chance due to her powerful psychic powers and Judge Joe Dredd, one of the city's most effective Judges, has been assigned to undertake her second evaluation. Anderson's test takes place in Peach Trees Block, a kilometre-high residential block of eighty thousand people, which has been taken over by a criminal gang and turned into a drugs factory. The two Judges have two hundred floors to ascend and countless obstacles in their way...and no back-up.<br /><br />Dredd is the second attempt to make a live-action movie based on the extremely popular Judge Dredd comic book. First appearing in 2000AD in the late 1970s, Judge Dredd is a satire on police procedurals and action movies. In particular, it pokes fun at the fascistic idea of single 'good' police officers being trusted to carry out law enforcement without oversight (something presented as laudable in Hollywood cop movies of the 1970s and 1980s, with 'good' policemen being hampered by bureaucratic officials from doing What Is Right in their eyes). Another film version was made in 1995 starring Sylvester Stallone in the title role. Whilst the 1995 moved nailed the offbeat, demented feel of Mega-City One in the comics and had some great (if impractical) production design, it was a failure in the departments of story, character and Rob Schneider. The 2012 film improves upon it in almost every department (starting with the laudable decision to not cast Rob Schneider) to deliver a highly entertaining action movie.<br /><br />Playing Dredd this time out is Karl Urban (or, more accurately, Karl Urban's Chin), who brings the requisite amounts of gravitas and presence to the role without descending into camp (as Stallone had a tendency to on occasion). He doesn't wisecrack (though a couple of his deliberately-understated reactions are quite amusing) but gets about business with relentless, grim efficiency. Dredd is presented as a force of nature. Staying true to the comics, he does not remove his helmet (unlike Stallone) and is presented as the faceless embodiment of The Law. However, he does have a highly practical and more flexible side to him, as shown by his willingness to ignore minor crimes, like vagrancy, whilst investigating much more serious ones. One of the limitations from the comic is that Dredd's character changes very slowly, only over years or decades, whilst writer Alex Garland only has an hour and a half to work with here. He can only hint that Dredd's opinions and character has been changed by his experiences in the block and with Anderson in the final scenes, but this is actually successful. Dredd himself looks surprised - or as surprised as a chin can be - by his final decision in the film which reflects his experiences.<br /><br />Olivia Thirlby plays Anderson with understatement. Anderson is a rookie who takes the carnage of dispensing justice on the streets with much less stoicism than Dredd, but is not presented as weak, only inexperienced. Anderson's psi abilities allow her to take courses of action that Dredd simply never considers (and usually rather less violent ones) and are used in a manner that makes sense: an elaborate deception and trap that is laid for her fails in a rather spectacular fashion. With Dredd not evolving much as a character over the course of the film, it's Anderson whose character evolution and arc is more central to the film and this is handled well by the writer and actress.<br /><br />Opposing both is Lena Headey as 'Ma-Ma' Madrigal, the gang leader who has effectively taken over the block. Ma-Ma is presented as an utterly ruthless criminal whose backstory (one of abuse before killing her abuser and taking over his crime empire) is not allowed to excuse her actions. She is a sociopathic monster rather than a scheming villain, which would not fit in well with the film's stripped-down atmosphere. Headey does some excellent work with the material she's given, though we actually spend a lot more time with Wood Harris (noted for his role as Avon Barksdale in The Wire). Though given a fairly limited character, Harris also does some good work, particularly in his psychic sparring scenes with Anderson where he tries to shock her with mental imagery only for Anderson to turn them back against him.<br /><br />The film has a laid-back, minimalist atmosphere. In early scenes this is disappointing, with Mega-City One looking suspiciously like a mildly CGI-enhanced versions of Johannesburg (where the movie was filmed). The crazy exuberance of the city in the comic, which is the one thing the 1995 movie did get right, is simply not present here and Mega-City One becomes just another characterless, futuristic cityscape. In particular, presenting the blocks as being massively spaced out means that the Block Wars of the comics are simply not possible now. However, this minimalism does work well once Dredd and Anderson hit the block and the mayhem kicks in. The aliens and robots of the setting are not in evidence, with Dredd and Anderson instead having to take on a tower full of human criminals (a tower considerably larger in volume than the Burj Khalifa in Dubai, for comparison's sake) in a focused hour or so of combat scenes and psychological warfare. Aside from a few moments that don't make sense (like a certain scene with three miniguns which is not only gratuitous, but completely pointless) these scenes are directed with energy, vigour and an awful lot of CGI blood.<br /><br />CGI is used sparingly throughout the film, with real explosions, bullets and models preferred. The most notable special effect sequences are those involving the 'Slo-Mo' sequences, where time is slowed down to a fraction of its normal rate by drugs. These add an air of balletic elegance that counterpoint the more frenetic action scenes. The film's score is also a success, with stripped-down industrial tracks giving way to more appropriately atmospheric mood pieces during the Slo-Mo scenes.<br /><br />Overall, Dredd (****) is a film that overcomes a low budget and limited premise though excellent performances (even by the bit-players), some impressive effects and a relentless pace, helped by a concise running time. Though the film's disappointing box office performance - which in the UK at least could be attributed to a crazy decision to not show the film in 2D in most cinemas - makes a sequel unlikely, I for one would welcome a return for Karl Urban's take on the lawman.

B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was a very good book and beyond worth the $.99 I paid for it.  Although parts of the book were way over my head technically, it didn't matter, I still followed the story and enjoyed it very much.  It was also a nice, long book and kept me busy for a while.  I appreciate that.  The only criticism I have is the ending -- I would have preferrecd a much bigger, emotionally charged ending.  However, it didn't make that much difference... I would definitely recommend this book.

If you look at any of the other reviews that go into great detail about all of the reasons this book is nothing but awful, then you'll know how I feel and why I gave it one star.  I would have given it less, if Amazon allowed me, like maybe one point on one star, but alas, one was the worst I could give it.  Read it if you must, but remember, you were warned.

0439023491|3.0|As books and movies so often go, when it comes to sequels, \\"Catching Fire\\" wasn't quite as good as the first in The Hunger Games trilogy.  It took me longer to get into it and care about the characters and the direction the book was taking.  I would say that I finally was hooked halfway through part two.  The book was still good, and I did enjoy it, but I felt like Suzanne Collins had a rough time getting this second book started.  I could almost imagine her pecking away at her keyboard trying to connect the sections, pulling her hair out and screaming obscenities. The pacing left me bored in several parts and I cared not what Katniss and company were doing. Once I got hooked though, and I started caring about the characters again, the story came back to life and I really wanted to know what was going to happen at the end. I'll be interested to see how they weave this tale into a movie.  My favorite part was the setting of the Quarter Quell and the interesting secrets it held.  My favorite character was Mags.  I wish she had been featured a little more.  The third book is the series is on my bookshelf, and I am eager to see what the future holds for Katniss, Peeta, Gale, and the others.

B008XNPO20|1.0|Love this album, but the vinyl is horrible. It's a cheap, thin, piece of garbage. It sounds better on MP3 than through the record player. TERRIBLE.
0670026603|5.0|Me Before You was recommended to me.  I was fully prepared for a light-hearted romantic novel.  This is not a light hearted romantic novel.  I repeat - \\"This is not a light hearted romantic novel\\".  However, it is an amazing story and very thought provoking.<br /><br />This novel grabs you from the start and will not let you set it down until the last page is turned.  It will have you crying, laughing and feeling blessed.<br /><br />This is a great story for men and women alike.  I would love to discuss with a male to get his take on it and compare his view to those made by Will, the main character.<br /><br />Don't wait another minute, pick up this novel and enter the world of Louisa and Will, you will be so glad you did.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved Colleen's first two novels.  Hopeless hit on some deep issues but it was a beautiful story that everyone should read!
076790592X|4.0|Tuesdays with Morrie is a heart rendering novel about a dying man and his student.  They discuss many things but the most defining topic  is death.  It is difficult for most of us to discuss death and assimilate our feelings.  This book is a great way to open your mind and explore your dreams, desires and true feelings about your death and the death of a close loved one.  There are many mantras to live by and I loved most of them but sometimes it felt like \\"yadda, yadda, yadda\\".  You know; imagine the voice of Charlie Brown's teacher.
B0042J6VUS|2.0|First of all, the top part doesn't rise anywhere near high enough to fit most phones.  I have a Motorola Droid Bionic and it's too wide for the top latch.  It fits in there, but the top is bent a bit from the size of the phone. So anyone with a larger smartphone, out of luck here. Aside from that, it feels like it will fall apart pretty fast.<br />I guess it's well constructed for $3 but.. eh, it wobbles a bit and getting the right angle is tough.<br />I'ts better than nothing, and way cheaper than anything else that will probably suck just as much.
1609611543|5.0|Well written, researched, and filled with simple guidelines to a more healthful mind and body. I never before thought of whole grain wheat as a danger to my thinking, feeling state and my health. Now I do.

B0060ZJ74O|5.0|Saw this movie on cable TV without knowning much about it other than its critical raves.  Absolutely loved it and I'm not anywhere close to being a baseball fan.  All the actors are terrific, especially Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill and especially Philip Seymour Hoffman.  I enjoyed the film so much that I bought the Blu-ray disc almost immediately thereafter.  When you want an alternative to all the mindless superhero and other escapist films, you can turn to MONEYBALL for some thoughtful and equally enjoyable entertainment.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|First of all the Sly Dredd was crap.  If you are looking for mind numbing action...this is it.  Basic plot (been done a million times), good guys trapped in a building with the bad guys......period thats the plot.  The action was good, the villian was hot, but needed a tooth brush.  Worth a rent, not a buy.
B007QUOQB6|5.0|I've read a few books like this and as far as practical information, exercises that make sense and something that gives you a real way forward towards your goals is concerned, this book is the best by far. I honestly don't think you need to buy another book like it. I really feel like this was what I was looking for.
B008UFUOH6|2.0|We bought this after reading reviews.  It just wasn't what we expected.  one two three four five six seven eight. (Stupid . . . review must be a certain number of words!)
B0094K1MH2|4.0|It was fun and delightful with some really exquisite CG at certain points. Fun for the whole family though fans of the original Tin Tins may find their childhood hero ruined to better suit a younger generation. But you really only remember the good things about it. Although for some reason Tintin's face freaked me out a bit the entire time. Just disturbed me but don't know why. But eh, good movie for the whole family in some non-bloody cartoon violence.
B005LAIHZE|5.0|Great action, keeps you engaged in the movies there is always something happening. We watched it twice in the same day and we never do that.
B007UXSPK2|5.0|Actually a good action film. I wasn't expecting much and the cheap intro sequence didn't exactly draw me in. But a brisk paced and light hearted story really kept me entertained the entire time. Remember, it just worked, don't think about it, overanalyze it, it worked like that and let's move on.
1427210241|5.0|I have loved this series since my wife told me about it. Once I picked it up two years ago I couldnt put it down! By the time you reach the last book in this wonderful series you have gained friends. My personal favorite character is Mat. There is so much going on in the book. I found it quite the emotional rollercoaster! I felt it did the series justice. (im trying not to say too much. No Spoilers!)

0399157565|4.0|I said to myself when I purchased this book that if it was anything like the last two or three then I was done.  I am so happy to say that is NOT the case.<br /><br />I was so excited two years ago when the description for PORT MORTUARY said it was going back inside Scarpetta's head, or in other words, back to the first person narrative.  However, I struggled to get through that book.  It was worse than THE SCARPETTA FACTOR which was a pretty bad book.  All of the third person Scarpetta books were bad to me, perhaps with the exception of BOOK OF THE DEAD, which was a much shorter better edited book.  Plus some things happened in that book which come back to the forefront in THE BONE BED.<br /><br />With THE BONE BED, I was engaged in the story right away and when I put it down, I found myself anxious to get back to the story to see what happened and finish it.  That has not happened for me with this series in a very long time.  Yes, this book was overly long and could have been edited a bit more, but it was still very good.  I do also have a problem with over half of the book taking place over a one day period.  The last two books have been like that too and it just makes me tired reading it.  Scarpetta is old and she needs her sleep!!  She is not Jack Bauer on 24.<br /><br />Anyway, this book was just so much better than the last six or eight and Scarpetta is almost back to her true form.  It's all about family (Lucy,Marino, and Benton), and there is even a cooking scene with decriptions of making a pizza that brought back some fond memories as well.<br /><br />Some have complained that the identity of the killer was not a big deal in the book or it did not seem that important.  Well, that has always been the case with most of her books.  The how and the why and the forensic detail have always been the most important part.  Also you have to remember, being a first person narrative, Scarpetta just doesn't come in contact with the killer until the investigation starts to come to a close.<br /><br />If you are a true die-hard Scarpetta fan, then I think you will like this book.  You may not love it but you will say, wow, I think she is getting there.  With a bit more editing and tightening up the story, I hope then next one is even better!

0061766089|5.0|This book isn't about &#34;design&#34; as much as it is about how to achieve creative, innovative problem solving.

B00A8SPNYW|5.0|I was initially lured into this by the rating, although remained somewhat skeptical at first about the game. I was initially thrown by the reviews accompanying the lower starred ratings but I'll add my comments in this review.<br /><br />I own a 2-year-old Samsung Vibrant. Top-of-the-line when I got it but nothing to write home about now. I was initially concerned that this game would perform poorly on my device as some of the newer, graphically intense 3D games do. I was quite surprised and impressed to find that the game ran flawlessly, nary a stutter to be had. I'm impressed with the detail in the game, yet that does not seem to cause an issue on my older hardware; animations and gameplay are very, very smooth.<br /><br />I've had issues with touch controls on some games as of late due to the intense requirements, which seem to cause touch input to falter. The controls in this game are, again, smooth. I can precisely control where the \\"scent\\" of the cheese goes without concern of lag. I can't say the same about Amazon's App Store app, which as of late is one of my worst performing apps. ;-)<br /><br />The progression of difficulty is good and the levels introduce new concepts seamlessly. One of my all-time favorite games is Portal. The game was incredible in how it trained you in a natural way. While this game is no Portal, I am impressed with the design that went into the levels. I easily passed the first 8 levels with three stars and I anticipate that, while there will be challenges ahead, I will generally be able to meet them without getting too frustrated.<br /><br />I'm not sure if this will have the staying power to keep me playing through all the levels - hardly any game has that kind of power for me now. I can say that I will return to this game repeatedly when I have a moment in the future. I love puzzlers and I love the way I can plan the scent route in this game without feeling rushed. While I got this free, I could EASILY see buying this game on any other day.<br /><br />To the detractors - if your device doesn't run this game I would suspect that your hardware is somewhat anemic or that the developer needs to investigate possible compatability issues. My Vibrant is *not* that great by today's standards but this game really works well on it. As for level 6, please realize that the \\"most obvious\\" route isn't always the correct route. I followed the \\"obvious\\" route the first time and only got 2 stars. Then, after a few seconds of experimentation I found a route that EASILY gave me 3 stars. Remember - the game will alert you to whether or not a trap is tripped when you plan the route.<br /><br />In summary, if you enjoy a good puzzler, this is likely worth your time. I won't waste time comparing it to other games - it is one of the few original offerings I've seen in a while and it stands well on its own. Enjoy it!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a great read. Have never read anything by this author and was pleasantly surprised. It was intense and took me by surprise. Loved it.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|I liked the book. I was entertained by the characters, who I felt were unique. I don't agree that they resemble other characters in other books. In fact, I felt the whole idea of writing of the 'god' Thor is a great and original idea. Think of the variety of new books following the same pattern! Which of the mythological gods will she write of next! What an imagination!
076115728X|5.0|I found this book on a list of books with a positive message. I loved it and so did my children. Wonderfully written. Nice and colorful.
0307474712|5.0|This story was a complete pleasure to read.  Two ships passing in the night plots have rarely been done so well.  The fantastically frustrating characters captured my affection from the first day.  I was sucked into their world(s) and laughed and cried along with both Emma and Dexter, somehow aligning myself with both protagonists simultaneously...  Are there any shortcomings to this work?  Of course!  Would I have written a different ending?  Perhaps, but that would have ruined the book.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />I'm almost afraid to see the movie now, but I surely will.

B008B68IV8|4.0|The Scaris Ghoulia shown in the prototype picture is stunning.  I love that straight little flip hairstyle she has going on.  However my Scaris Ghoulia came with a curly ponytail not the flip to die for.  She still is a very nice looking Ghoulia but I would have preferred to have straight hair much like the original Ghoulia that came out.  It's just my personal preference.  Love the Red, Red glasses, the outfits colorful too just wish if they were going to put a hoodie on it that you could actually use it on the doll.  She comes with her overnight travel case and rockin blue high heeled boots.  She poses well and her make up is spot on for running around Scaris.

B0012PDVQ2|5.0|Very easy film to review.<br />Blade Runner is the best science fiction movie ever made.<br />Every time I watch it, I am amazed at how good it is!
B005HV6Y84|4.0|Twilight Soundtrack CDs<br />I really like it, the music is great, good sounds.<br />yes, I would recommend anyone to buy the Twilight cds.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I have two sons, 12 and 11, and an 8 year old daughter.  They all rolled when watching this movie.  It is fun and funny, so it wins in my book.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I listen to it every day in my truck.<br />I would recommend to anyone to buy it.<br />It contains good songs.
B007NU54H4|5.0|My 8 year old has loved Tinker Bell since she was 2.  I used to make up stories for her at bedtime that involved Tinker Bell being rescued by my daughter and how they would become the best of friends.  All of the Tinker Bell movies are wonderful.  They show a spunky, yet sensitive, side to Tink, and the adventures are always fun.  My daughter has watched each movie over and over.
B000IHY9SE|5.0|I like this cd because  it reminded me of how real Eminem is and I had this cd before but it got stolen but thank you for bringing me my product in a timely matter
B0009XNUK0|5.0|She discovered Michael Jackson when she watched &#34;This Is It&#34; when she was 6.  She recorded it and rewatched that movie dozens of times.  Then we got the Michael Jackson Wii game, and she danced her legs off to it.  I finally decided to get the cd for her, and she could not have been happier.  The songs are wonderful, the sounds is high quality, and I can not complain about the music she listens to since it is the same music I grew up with.  :-)  Great cd.
B005G5PPGS|4.0|Very well written and tells Billy`s story. Shows what he thinks about how baseball is run. A great book 4 stars.

B000VYX8PE|4.0|This book is just great for little and big kids:)  and fun to read at any age or time of day
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I usually like Patricia Cornwell but thought this book was way to boring and drawn out. If I enjoy a book I have a hard time putting it down but it took me for what seemed like forvever to get to the end and when I did I forgot who the character was that was the serial killer.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I truly love and admire the Percy Jackson series!!! I'm just gonna waste all my money to buy this books! I have an incredible love for Greek mythology. I could really understand what Percy Jackson was going through. I felt like I could really relate to him! This is my official favorite book ever!!!! :D
B0081SPK0I|5.0|This is avery fun and exciting game.  Keeps you involved and interested.  Definitely would recommend this to friends and family.
B000FC2KL0|4.0|It is a great read for anyone but especially for a recovering addict.Sounds like you have found serinty Anthony,I want what you have brother,and I am willing to go to any lengths to get it.Thanks for sharing.
B00AKKGX4W|5.0|i was entirely delighted with this book - a interesting, intelligent, heroine who has depth, who feels emotion and passion and yet isn't defined by them nor is turned into a sniveling, panting moron as soon as our hero walks in the room...and a hero is not \\"arrogantly male\\" (why anyone thinks that's an attractive way to describe a man, i have no idea...makes me think of douchebags are us...but i digress.), and yet still strong, attractive, thoughtful and passionate.<br /> A situation that was a slightly new twist, a hero who was human, a heroine i entirely respected!  Amazing!<br /><br />Yes, this book is not the mad rush into lust and the nearest bed (settee, wall, bench, carriage...whatever).  Is is a slower story, with a much stronger then normally offered female lead and a less domineering then normal male lead. If you really like the idea of the overbearing male sweeping the heroine completely off her feet and out of her mind, you won't like this.  Which is fine, as there is tons of that sort of thing that is written well and even more of it that is just drivel romanticizing a blatantly abusive relationship... but lordie, i hope Ms Milan keeps writing like this for those of us who want to enjoy the stories she creates and respect her characters.
B002VH7P4O|5.0|I am an audio junkie.  High end this and that.  Digitization of listening space.  Weeks of laser positioning for speakers.  180 Gram Vinyl is the standard, etc.  I love pure audio.  With that said:<br /><br />I have always loved the Beatles.  I had all of the albums in the day.  When I saw the Vinyl was going to become available in November of 2012 I was shaking with anticipation.  While I was waiting I grabbed a few of my favorite singles from the other audio place (iSomething or other), I also saw this USB stick on Amazon. I read all of the reviews (some of which are much better than what I pen now) and was intrigued.  All of the albums in 192/44 flac.  I read hundreds of reviews, talked with a fellow audiophile and read even more.  Finally I decided to take a  chance on what may have been a gimicky little toy.  The order was placed in a moment of weakness with Amazon knowing full well if I was not satisfied I could return for a full refund (I am also an Amazon customer since 2001).<br /><br />It arrived today.  I opened the box and went to the studio.  I turned on the lights, fired the amps, ran the speaker warm up, fired the audio server and X1, plugged in the cute little USB and loaded J-River.  The import to my library took seconds with the 7.9GB of flac files.  Browsed to Beatles For Sale and hit play on No Reply.  I almost cried.<br /><br />The most stunning audio I own.  Yes I am a Vinyl purist but this blew away any of the Beatles vinyl.  Don't get me wrong, the vinyl box set is a must, but if you MUST choose one format or another and have the proper equipment the USB is the way to go.<br /><br />FLAC, Vinyl, CD or MP3?  Okay, for the portable device the MP3s are top quality for a compressed format.  No DRM and all are sampled at 320.  Heaven for on the go listening.  With that said, I started the comparison between the USB flac, the USB MP3, CD and Vinyl.  I chose Let It Be for the test.  As I fully expected when compared to the other formats the MP3 is muddy, compressed and not suitable for anything but a portable.  This is not the fault of the stick but of compressed audio, enough said.  Next the CD and as you would expect it sounded great.  No pop or hiss, nice separation and comfortably familiar.  Next the vinyl, rich and full with little hiss or pop and until today my reference material for The Beatles.  The flac, un-paralleled low end, full and rich in mid-range and the high end is perfect. The soundstage is ever present without anything to distract a fully immersed experience.  Close my eyes and John, George, Ringo and Paul are in my room playing their greatest hits.<br /><br />I wish all artist (or at least my top 100) would do this.  No DRM, all of the album cover art and 192/44 from the master tapes (not the compressed CD). Please note that I support the artist and faithfully purchase ALL music I listen to, the No DRM just makes it very easy to put into a MediaMonkey or J-River library.<br /><br />The quality of the Apple is top end and is fully covered in all the other reviews along with the other digital content.  A nice addition.<br /><br />My review has come to an end and my opinion is buy this before the vinyl (mono and/or the new 180g releases), before CDs and don't bother with the other services compressed formats.  As long as you have the resources (ASIO) to handle the flac all the way to the DAC I can't see how any audiophile will do anything but play over and over with tears in the eyes.
B0051GOB26|5.0|No need to review the movie itself, it's been out for long enough and has a large cult following; there's nothing I can say about it that hasn't been more eloquently stated before. I'm a sucker for cool packaging, and Blu-ray Books are second to only Steelbooks in my opinion. The full color pages are high quality paper and filled with great photos and trivia. The Blu-ray transfer is good, but could have been better. Night/dark scenes are a little muddy/messy looking, and the movie overall isn't very vibrant. The picture quality is still great (the best Lewbowski has ever looked) and a huge leap over the DVD version, but it's not the kind of quality where you'd use this movie to show off your new HDTV, either. This is definitely worthy of being part of your collection, though. It'll really tie your room together.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game!! its fun and addictive, I can play for about an hour without getting bored, or more!! there hasn't been any glitches that I've noticed... definately worth it!! I recommend it for really anyone
B007Q1VUFA|5.0|I love this album.  CR never fails to please.  I love the Crowes and all the other Chris Robinson solo albums.  This one is quite different than the other two.  More trippy, kinda Grateful dead like, but with the soulful vocals of CR.  Neal Casall really shines in his guitar work here.<br /><br />Saw CRB live 3 times and they are a fantastic live band, just as the Crowes are.  This takes a few listens, to really pick up the subleties of the music.  Longer jammy songs than the other CD's.  That is one thing I love about his work.  Every album has a slightly different flavor and always impressive.
B004GYY714|5.0|This was a great idea. I am able to listen to whatever radio station I want on my smartphone, whenever I want.
B0041KBWM0|2.0|It was okay, but seem to drag to me.  I also didn't feel a real the chemistry between Emma & Mr Knightley.
B00991TCOG|5.0|Loving the album.  Love to listen to it while im writing. Really gets me in the mood. Cant wait to hear more from Lindsey :)
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Purchased the album after seeing muse in concert on palladia TV. Their sound is unique and energetic, creative and fresh. You  will not be disappointed.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|Wow, I couldn't put it down once iI began reading. I really enjoyed the concept and style of the composition.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|One word..... Great!<br /><br />I read this because, I have a teenage daughter that wants to read the books. After reading, this book is not appropriate for a 14yr old.
B000067CPX|5.0|Good tracklist, i wasn't glad that half of the songs on this CD didn't make it to there Greatest Hits album, but the CD was amazing in my opinion, adding it to my rack of CD's
B001VIMCW4|3.0|If you are a Bond fan/completionist, of course you need to see this movie.  That being said, this was neither my favorite Bond movie, nor my favorite appearance by Daniel Craig as James Bond.
B0015DWJX2|5.0|Simply put: One of the best books I've read in a long, long time. Kicking myself for keeping it on my Wish List for so long before getting it. Wonderful characters and dialogue. And I knew nothing of the German occupation of the Channel Islands in WWII, so it was educational without being dry, as well as entertaining.
B009VB97EY|2.0|Aside from the plot being incredibly juvenile, only one guy -the lead man, could really dance. The rest are obviously actors, not dancers. In trying to go for realistic, the plot became seedy and nearly obscene.
0425252868|4.0|The chivalry and code of honor from the time of medieval knights played out again with the pilots of WWII over the European skies. Mankind is capable of good and evil. Evil gets the headlines but acts of mercy like Franz Stigler's go on around us unnoticed until stories like this are publicized.<br />\\"A Higher Call\\" is such a compelling story I routinely missed the asterisks signaling a footnote until I saw the footnote text at the bottom of the page making me go back to find the notation. It wasn't until Chapter Nine that I saw the first small number to indicate a reference to the bibliography. Either I was reading at 300 mph in my Bf-109 or the flak bursting around my B-17 distracted me.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Films that show that females can and do have the qualities we have all known they have are finally being made. It is good they are targeting children. That is when they need to be told they are capable human beings and don't need to make nice and always play quietly with dolls in preparation for being a stepford wife.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I didn't think it was possible for me to sob uncontrollably while reading a book. I couldn't put this book down! A heartfelt story that keeps you wanting more!
B007ELN8Y8|3.0|There is a reason movies have sound these days-because people are capable of speech. This might have gone over really well amongst the eclectic film professionals or at Galudet college, but not for mainstream America.
B000QXDEDG|5.0|The story of the battle that saved democracy as 300 Spartans held off thousands or persians while Athens and Sparts evacuated in the advance of the army of Xerxes.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|A story that will grip you as you read and stay with you forever. Personally it fired me up to never forget how important it is to nurture and honour women - things have to change and move forward so humanity can evolve.
B000002KGT|5.0|I had this back in the 70's and played it 24/7.  I just love every song on it.  Can't wait to get it and the new one coming out!
B002CMXAYW|5.0|A movie that had me laughing throughout; from the comical song references to the cucumbers in peculiar hiding places... Enjoy!
B000SEKNUK|5.0|This is an extremely thought provoking book filled with novel concepts and useful practical insights to see life as opportunities and with a glass half full perspective!
0762439009|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies ever! I love Jeff Bridges and this is just something every fan must own. Affordable and really cool.
0143118706|5.0|Marriage is work. So often these days we hear of divorce,  separations, and more people staying single. It's natural that we feel a little lost and confused when it comes to modern day relationships. Elizabeth Gilbert takes a look at the history of marriage across several different cultures and helps us understand why everything's gotten so out of whack and why there's a regular need for a Facebook relationship status of 'it's complicated'. The reader joins her on a necessary journey to make peace with marriage. This book is a real world follow up to her very freeing 'eat pray love'. I feel both men and women can learn quite a bit from it and I'd recommend it to any girls dreaming of their fantasy wedding day.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Well written and the storyline is plausible. Well written and the storyline is plausible. Well written and the storyline is plausible.
B005OT2YVA|2.0|Oh please... this movie doesn't tell a story so much as show off special effects and replay platitudes. Should've left well-enough alnoe instead of making this far-too-long sequel.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great pace, well written and very believable. Great pace, well written and very believable. Great pace, well written and very believable.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I cannot stop listening to this album!  It is perfect - some songs are upbeat while others are more melodic - but they are all wonderful.  He has an amazing way with lyrics that brings you into each song regardless of it's tempo, and then his voice - it floors you.
B007Q0OUNA|5.0|I purchased this set for my 10-year-old son.  He loves it!  He recently read the book and said he is amazed at all the detail LEGO included in the set.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|A very good read. Keeps my interest. It is nice to read about a great man in this day and time.
034580404X|5.0|This is pretty unique high-class pornography. Amazing that we apparently never before heard of this author and then she sits down and writes three volumes, getting better and better. Who is she?
B004QOB8SO|4.0|As a dedicated Baker Street Irregular, I have usually hated \\"adaptations\\" and \\"modernizations\\" of Conan Doyle's marvelous creation.  I tuned into Season One of this latest effort to bring Holmes & Watson into the 21st century and found myself, for once, utterly charmed.  Each of the episodes in both seasons is \\"based upon\\" one of the original Holmes stories, and for the most part, the adaptations are sly and plausible; purists will find something to quibble about in each one, as I did, but the overall high enjoyability quotient provides sufficient compensation for a few violations.  Credit for the success here is shared between skilled writing and the very game cast, starting with Benedict Cumberbatch, giving us a slightly more youthful and tempestuous, excitable Sherlock than we are accustomed to seeing on film or imagining from Conan Doyle's stories. This Sherlock is not so much cool as, well, as he puts it himself, \\"a high-functioning sociopath\\". It is Cumberbatch's task to persuade us to take the journey at all, and he pulls it off through a combination of wit, nerve, sincerity, and effrontery.  He is ably supported by Martin Freeman (Bilbo Baggins in \\"The Hobbit\\") as Dr. Watson, who manages to maintain a distinct humanity while functioning as the central protagonist's foil.  Mycroft, Sherlock's brother, is cheerfully given a wider role and an opportunity to be somewhat less opaque than he is in Conan Doyle's stories - partly because, as you'll see if you watch the special feature program, he is played by Mark Gatiss, one of the original writers-creators of the show.<br /><br />Season Two gives us episodes based on \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\", \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\", and \\"The Reichenbach Falls\\" - the latter was the story in which the exhausted Conan Doyle tried to kill off his creation so he could stop writing the stories; in the event, public outcry forced Conan Doyle to find a way to resurrect the Great Detective, and publish a new series of adventures.<br/><br />I see that some viewers were offended by the treatment of Irene Adler, the heroine of \\"A Scandal in Bohemia\\" (here, \\"A Scandal in Belgravia\\").  I found it rather delicious and, of course, it offers us the only glimpse we will ever have of Sherlock responding to a woman in any but an analytical way.<br /><br />In my opinion, the only real failure over both seasons was the very, very disappointing take on the best-known of all Holmes's adventures, \\"The Hound of the Baskervilles\\".  The Hound has been filmed on its own quite a few times, sometimes to better and sometimes to worse effect, and always properly located at the end of the Victorian era.  However, none of those attempts, and indeed not this attempt, have been able to capture adequately the thrilling twists and turns of the original story.  In the attempt seen here on Season Two of Sherlock, the writers have this time gone way too far afield, thrown in too many gimmicks, diluted the mysterious qualities of the story.  And as most other films of the story have, the writers here missed their opportunity to replicate the revelatory moment when Holmes puts his arm around the Jacobite trimmings worn by the debauched Sir Hugo Baskerville in his portrait at Baskerville Hall, and the face of Stapleton the naturalist springs out of the canvas - giving us the villain of the piece in a brilliant theatrical stroke. I have never seen a screen transfer of The Hound that was as satisfying as reading the story: perhaps it is just one of those works meant only to be seen in the mind's eye.<br /><br />The last episode of Season Two is very fraught - the baleful consulting criminal, Jim Moriarty, (Andrew Scott in a quirky yet menacing, and oddly youthful portrayal - this talented actor can also be seen in Season One of \\"The Hour\\" and in a \\"Foyle's War\\" episode), is mounting ever more vicious attempts to ruin Holmes, and seems to be pulling off some stunning coups in his persecution.  I was not happy with Moriarty's lastaction, as it seemed too far out of character for the world's greatest consulting criminal, but there, can't have everything . . .<br /><br />All in all, unless you are so die-hard a purist that imagining Sherlock using an I-Phone makes you break out in hives, this is a worthwhile modernization of Conan Doyle's fascinating consulting detective, and a worthy follow-up to Season One with the exception of \\"The Hound\\".<br /><br />As we all know that Holmes returned to life after his adventure on the edges of the Reichenbach Falls, and we are allowed to see him at the close of Season Two hovering out of sight of his mourners, we may hope that Season 3 is not too far behind. However, word has it that due to commitments to other ventures, including Peter Jackson's \\"The Hobbit\\" by the two stars (in addition to Freeman starring as Bilbo, Cumberbatch is appearing in the second and third installments as the voice of Smaug and as The Necromancer), Season 3 will not debut until, at least, fall 2013 or early 2014.  Quite a while to wait before we get to see the famous opening scene of \\"The New Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\", as Holmes reappears suddenly before Dr. Watson who, for the first and last time in his life, passes out.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love it! Really challenges your mind. I love playing it although it can be a bit hard...other than that, great app!
B00005ASIL|5.0|Awesome Band!  You can't compare Jethro Tull to any other band.  Their music is unique and exceptional.  Very happy with this cd!  Also, the quality of the packaging and cd where perfect.  Would use this vendor again.
B0014J8D9Q|5.0|Years ago when I first saw this movie, it did not have a big impact on me. But like the main character of William Munny, age and experience has changed my outlook towards it....so much that I now rate it as one of my favorite films.<br /><br />You eventually see the tough, hard nosed character which Eastwood made so famous in many of his early films but not before you witness his character's many weaknesses and shortcomings.<br /><br />What really drove me to get the Blu-ray version of the movie was to compare its video quality to that of the standard DVD format. I've noticed that not all Blu-ray movie disks are created equally. Just because a movie is on Blu-ray does not necessarily mean that the video quality will be significantly better than an upscaled standard DVD version that was created from a good master copy.  I was confused at seeing so many versions (and sales prices) of Blu-ray disks for the same movie but now I'm beginning to feel that the most important criteria is the quality of the master from which the Blu-ray disk was created from.<br /><br />Fortunately, the version I purchased (marked with a release date of 2010) does have a superior video quality than the standard DVD copy I have and makes it a welcomed addition to my film collection.
0765325950|4.0|Ch. 1 An Empty Road<br /><br />The Wheel of Time turns, and Ages come and pass, leaving memories that become legend.  Legend fades to myth, and even myth is long forgotten when the Age that gave it birth comes again.  It one Age, called the Third Age by some, an Age yet to come, an Age long past, a wind rose in the Mountains of Mist.  The wind was not the beginning.  There are neither beginnings nor endings to the turning of the Wheel of Time.  But it was a beginning.<br /><br />Those words started me, and many others, on a journey that has lasted over 20 years.  Well, for us, we have finally come to the end of that journey.  We can finally say adieu to characters we have grown to know, love, and hate.  Upon learning of Mr. Jordan's illness and finally his death, I didn't think this day would come.  When the baton was passed to Brandon Sanderson (an author of whom I knew next to nothing) I began reading his published books.  I was uncertain of the outcome but personally am satisfied with the conclusion.  While his writing style is different from Jordan, and in reading the books back to back that will be more apparent, he was able to remain true to the \\"heart of the story\\" and help us complete this long journey.<br /><br />In writing this review of MoL it is more a review of the series than this final book.  I doubt if many \\"new\\" readers are checking out these reviews, but rather those who have been reading it for a number of years.  If, however, there are any pondering whether or not to start this series, I would give an unqualified \\"yes\\".  You, new reader, will not have to suffer the frustration of<br /><br />a.  waiting years between books and the sometimes necessary rereads in order to refresh your memory of who's who,<br />b.  what is going on with the numerous plot threads,<br />c.  and the death of the original author.<br /><br />MoL deals primarily with the Last Battle - while I am not one who particularly enjoys focusing on that particular subject, in this case it seems appropriate.  Thirteen books have been leading to this, so doesn't it make sense this book should be about the Last Battle.  We come to this final chapter with many unresolved plot threads/characters and Sanderson IMHO has done a satisfactory job in pulling it together.  Yes, some of the threads/character resolutions seems rushed but with the scope of the story I don't know what else could have been done - especially since the book is primarily devoted to the Last Battle itself.<br /><br />We lose some dear friends, old enemies get their just rewards, there are some surprising heroes, characters are challenged to look within themselves and discover truths that are sometimes painful but are necessary - and sometimes that truth is that you just have to let go.<br /><br />Are all our questions answered?  No.  I am not sure that would be possible.  We have come to know these characters so intimately over the last two decades that to have resolution of their individual stories would be an unending work - like life itself.  Maybe an ending with me wanting to know more is as it should be.<br /><br />Was this ending the one I wanted - no, I cannot say that it was, but it was an ending.ase it seems appropriate.

B004LWZWGK|5.0|I don't want to spoil anyone on this movie. If you like the first 2 you will LOVE this one. Don't watch this without watching first two for you to understand the final act.<br /><br />The key thing that makes me like this movie so much is that Christopher Nolan make you emotionally relate to be a dark hero. Not just a super human who can do supernatural things, but regular human like you and me who can get hurt and grow old, go through much trouble to become a hero that takes it all.
0316232955|3.0|I first decided to read this book when i saw the trailer for the movie. I didn't even know the movie was based on a book! Needless to say, I was super excited about it. The author, who's an actor in Glee (awesome show, btw), seemed like a really funny guy so I figured I would like it.<br /><br />I was not wrong about the book being funny. It really was. I was laughing on the train like a crazy woman, while people were giving me dirty looks. The main character,Carson Phillips, was hilarious. I actually really liked him. He was honest, confident in himself, and eager to make his dreams come true. Of course, he didn't really go about it the right way, but whatever. I still liked him. He was definitely the highlight of the book, not the plot.<br /><br />I liked Carson's comments and opinions, he sounded very much like an overachieving teenager. We all knew those people in high school. It was nice to be able to get inside his head and experience what was going on in his life through his journal entries. The entries worked very well, I think. Carson was sharing his life with only me (or whoever's reading) and it felt like he was just a friend, writing me letters about his day.<br /><br />Despite me liking Carson, I had so many other issues with the book. The other characters all seemed \\"dummed down\\" and they sounded unrealistic. Some of the things they said and did made them sound like elementary school students. I didn't buy it. Besides the unrealistic cast of characters, another issue was that these people were basically strangers to me. I didn't really know anything about them, other than the superficial stuff. Though Carson didn't know much about them either, being all anti-social and all, but I wish he would have discussed them a little more.<br /><br />During some parts of the book, I was questioning whether this book was written to be a movie... I mean, some parts just seemed like scenes in a movie or tv show, more than that of a book. I'm not sure how to explain it and I don't have the direct quotes now, but I was just iffy about that.<br /><br />Overall, the book wasn't my favorite. There was a lot that could have been fixed, mainly issues with the characters. They needed to have been given broader personalities, since they fell flat for me. I wish I had liked it more, since I had such high hopes. I did watch the movie and I felt that it was slightly better than the book.

B000SEH80I|5.0|It's book is written for those who suffered emotional and physical trauma at the hands of their parents.  I was able to relate to many of the case studies she referenced in the book.  The last chapters deal with coming to terms with the abuse, and how to begin the healing.  I highly recommend this book.
160774273X|4.0|This book is not only full of great recipes and tips on making your own bread and pizza crust, but it is also full of beautiful and helpful pictures.  I bought it as a gift for my boyfriend who was already accustomed to making his own bread and he absolutely loves this book!
B003SI3URQ|5.0|This movie is so underrated and I don't know why. We love it in this household. It is my son's favorite disney movie with Aladdin coming a close second. James Woods is the best thing in it of course. Buy it, Watch it, Enjoy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|So good. I didn't think it could be as exciting as the first book. I was on the edge of my seat.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Fast-paced, well written story that kept my attention the whole read.  Martin's tendency to kill of his main characters is one that I have yet to become accustomed to, but regardless the skill of his writing and the richness of the storyline makes this an enjoyable read.
B005KELW26|3.0|didnt fit my kindle hd although it said it would.........like the design but was too small the description should be more accurate
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Saw the movie and I loved it. When I found it was based on a book had to read it. It's a book that for we was very relatable in several aspects.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Fantastic book and a great &#34;sort of&#34; end to a great series...don't want to give anything away, but if your're going to read &#34;Iced&#34; and it's been a while since you've ready &#34;Shadowfever&#34;, you might want to re-read it.. besides, it's good enough for multiple re-reads!
0765325950|4.0|I feel unsatisfied by this series ending...not that this was a bad end, but because any end would be bad...there is something too epic in Jordan's creation for this to end, it has felt like perhaps it should have branched into a series of linked, but independent novels to explore and tell the stories of a few of the many characters Jordan created...the work is just that rich with potential.<br /><br />Many times during this series we leave favorite characters behind to follow another leaving untold much that would be of great interest in this epic world. I would see those tales told, by new authors of course, but in the rich tradition Jordan spoiled us all on.<br /><br />This tale has been a part of three decades of my life...and though i'm not a part of the 'fandom nation' he garnered online, nor am i so well versed in the detail of each book as some, i suspect there is a great market for a few branches in the storyline and more material than even a handful of authors could handle.<br /><br />Over these past decades i often wondered what would happen should, god forbid, Jordan should pass, and leave the tales untold...or would i go before he published them...neither were welcome possibilities, but i have read them all, and yet, i still feel there should have been more...Thom Merillon pondered in this book when to end the telling of a tale, and his answer was to leave town while you were still a novelty among the people...not in those words of course, but close enough. I feel like we were left wanting more, that much goes untold, and of course that makes for a great storybook ending...but Robert Jordan is lost to us now...there will be no 'next big thing' from him...I don't feel ready to move on, to not look forward to what's next in 'The Eye of the World' epic three decade long series...<br /><br />My compliments to Brandon Sanderson for filling impossible to fill shoes...no one could be Robert Jordan but the man himself...it was brave to take this on.<br /><br />There will always be those who claim the book was disappointing...those same people have said that about volumes when Jordan lived, and wrote them himself...don't allow anyones comments keep you from bearing witness to The Last Battle....here will always be those who claim the book was disappointing...those same people have said that about volumes when Jordan lived, and wrote them himself...don't allow anyones comments keep you from bearing witness to The Last Battle....
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the first Nicholas Sparks book I have read.  Not the last.  For sure.  Substitute`s are so real it's like being in the book.  I loved it.
0062124293|5.0|\\"Sometimes you read a book and it fills you with this weird evangelical zeal,\\"* and you want to give copies to everyone you know, even hand them out like liquidation sale fliers to strangers on the street.  This is not one of those books.  Kidding, totally kidding.  Caitlin Moran absolutely nails it.  I read the cover advertisement heralding \\"How To Be a Woman\\" as \\"the British version of Tina Fey's `Bossypants,'\\" and thought, yeah right, I bet the pages of this book aren't even worthy of wiping Tina Fey's a$$ on a camping trip; Tina'd sooner use poison ivy.  My skepticism of the parallel turned out to be warranted: Moran's book is way better than \\"Bossypants.\\"<br /><br />To start with, Moran is a descriptive genius.  A hilarious descriptive genius.  In one breath she proclaims \\"a lifelong affection for camp, waspy men who show their love with increasingly vile insults (`Hello, Repulsive')\\" and with the next describes fingering as \\"the slightly more grown-up version of a toddler's implacable desire to jam their fingers into DVD players.\\"  Wrinkles?  \\"Lines and grayness are nature's way of telling you not to f^&% with someone - the equivalent of the yellow-and-black banding on a wasp. . . .\\"  Drugs?  When her boyfriend insults and debases Moran in front of others she says, \\"I'm so embarrassed that I take Ecstasy, just for something to do with my face.\\"  Domesticity?  She writes that a husband reacts to his wife splurging on something nice for herself \\"as if you've just stabbed [him] quite violently in the balls with a fork, left the fork there, and then hung your coat on it while you go and have a bath.\\"<br /><br />But her real feat, contributing in a meaningful way to the modern feminist cause with wit and mirth, is matched only by Tina Fey on \\"Saturday Night Live\\" and \\"30 Rock\\" and Mindy Kaling on \\"The Office\\" and \\"The Mindy Show,\\" AND NEITHER ONE OF THEM PULLED IT OFF IN HER OWN BOOK.  (Mindy!  Tina!  Please, I liked your book.  Really, I did.  Just not this much.)  Here are some of my favorite examples of Moran's uniquely literary brand of humorous feminism:<br /><br />- \\"Women wear heels because they think they make their legs look thinner, end of.  They think that by effectively walking on tiptoes, they're slimming their legs down from a size 14 to a size 10.  But they aren't of course.  There is a precedent for a big fat leg dwindling away into a point - and it's on a pig.\\"<br /><br />- \\"I wholeheartedly believe that, should they wish to, strident feminists are allowed to flirt their way to the top, without compromising their strident feminist principles one smidge. . . .  [After all] \\"[y]our male peers are flirting with their male bosses constantly.\\"<br /><br />- \\"At 14, I am an experiment.  Inside, I am being resurrected.  I am in the middle of the kind of explosion of perspective that, in later years, I will pay a great deal of money to emulate in nightclubs, and at parties, in bathrooms - counting out tenners for pills in order to feel a tenth this remorseless, expanded, and inspired.\\"<br /><br />- \\"With female fertility being presented as something limited and due to vanish quite soon, there's a risk of women panicking and having a baby `just in case' - in much the same way they panic and buy a half-price cashmere cardigan two sizes too small in a sale.\\"<br /><br />- \\"[I]n the real world, we know that women who always blow-dry their hair before leaving the house are freaks: any mother at the school gates with a glossy bob is subject to pitying looks from the other mothers, who can't believe she wasted 20 minutes, and a lot of upper-arm strength, zazzing her riah for any event less momentous than publicly announcing her engagement to Kiefer Sutherland at Cannes.\\"<br /><br />- \\"When the subject turns to abortion, cosmetic intervention, birth, motherhood, sex, love, work, misogyny, fear, or just how you feel in your own skin, women still won't often tell the truth to each other unless they are very, very drunk.  Perhapsthe endlessly reported rise in female binge drinking is simply modern women's attempt to communicate with each other.  Or maybe it is because Sancerre is so very delicious.\\"<br /><br />- \\"I've read more about Oprah Winfrey's arse than I have about the rise of China as an economic superpower.  I fear this is no exaggeration.  Perhaps China is rising as an economic superpower because its women aren't spending all their time reading about Oprah Winfrey's arse.\\"<br /><br />- \\"[T]he reason these instances [of sexism] are so pernicious and damaging is the element of doubt involved.  Are they being sexist on purpose or is it just some accidental sexism, due to carelessness and stupidity?\\"<br /><br />As a former desk jockey, I both agree (with the flirting and \\"just some accidental sexism\\" points) and disagree (Moran, keep your grubby mom-hands off my high heels).  I don't think I buy her \\"is it polite?\\" catchline for ferreting out sexism, but one of the very best parts of the book is that I don't feel like I have to.  Moran champions an individualization of feminism in which each woman can make her own judgment calls and feminist policy (like Moran's \\"no\\" to strip clubs and \\"yes\\" to burlesque) without apologizing.  The Quaker in me likes that.  The mom in me also found plenty to feel good about.  And the woman in me is dancing on a metaphorical table in my prettiest bra and panties waving the book over my head.<br /><br />\\"How To Be a Woman\\" is the kind of book that makes me want to demote all the others to which I've awarded five-stars.  Now I know why people devised the 5.0 GPA scale and the generalissimo.<br /><br />*John Green, \\"The Fault in Our Stars\\"the endlessly reported rise in female binge drinking is simply modern women's attempt to communicate with each other.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|I have read two previous abridged editions of Les Miserables, but this free kindle version is the best of the translations.  This book is long, but it provides great depth of character development and like Cervantes book \\"Don Quixote,\\", Hugo weaves stories within stories that not only develop characters, but also pursue various existential themes.  Like Dostoyevsky, Hugo provides unvarnished insight into the hearts and minds of the characters that makes you feel like you know them personally.<br /><br />This book is not an easy read.  It is filled with detail and digressions and if you are to enjoy reading it, you will need to set aside a generous amount of time and open your mind.  This is a social commentary that shows how the poor are victimized and how poverty changes people.  It presents characters at their very best and at their very worst.  Hugo's insight into the human condition is towering, and I believe that he rates with the best authors of all time including Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Cervantes and Hawthorne.,
0345536886|5.0|Ever had a job you'd like to run from? You'll love chapter 2. Reminds me of Grisham's The Street Lawyer with rich characters, humor, and a thoroughly likeable main character.

B006LSZECO|5.0|Great book.  Kept me guessing the entire time.  Definitely would recommend!!!  A real page turner!!  Anxious to read more books by Gillian Flynn.
1451620829|1.0|I'm not a big Kiss fan but picked this up because I was interested in reading about that con artist who successfully snookered Roseanne and Tom Arnold into believing he was Criss some years ago.<br /><br />Threw it back down after reading just first two sentences of Chapter One: \\"I entered the world on December 20, 1945, feet first, ass backward, a breech baby. They didn't have C-sections in those days. . .\\"<br /><br />Caesarian sections (which date back to--and were named after--Julius Caesar) were unknown in 1945??? How dumb can this character be? (Not to mention whoever allegedly proofread it, edited it and/or ghostwrote it?)<br /><br />Clearly, guy who snowed Roseanne and Tom was a lot, lot sharper than Criss. HIS book, I'd read.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|great cheap entertainment - recommended for the whole family.  Occasionally frustrating yet enticing enough to continue to play hoping to WIN!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I was looking for a game for my grandson to play. I thought it was going to be to hard for a 3 year old. I was surprised that he took right to it. I can see his mind working when he moves up a few levels. Great .Game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It is a great book I have read it 3 times so to those out there keep on reading .
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The entire series has fascinated me, for some unfathomable reason.  Have downloaded all episodes on my Kindle and have watched the first two seasons about five times.  Each time, I pick up some little comment or action that forcasts a later reaction--some little comment or action I had missed the first couple of times around.  Call me nuts!  I am an 83-year-old reasonably intelligent woman who has never been this attached to a TV show.
B0007X9T5M|4.0|I would make this a five star rating, but, when I first put it in my DVD player it wouldn't play. Come to find out that I had to set my DVD player to a different region to play this DVD. Other than that, the DVD is awesome if you like Dido.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Totally engrossed.  Great story . . . great acting.  Science fiction meets horror meets morality tale. Totally different from First Season.<br /><br />Addendum: There are a whole lot of story lines going on here . . . too many. The alien-thing kind of tips the scales for me. Still hooked, though. Wouldn't miss an episode.
B005HSL626|1.0|Files was corrupted and did not load.  Cannot play it.  Can't rate what can't be played.  It's too bad because I had heard good things about it.
B0076DCT2G|2.0|I'll keep this one brief because earlier reviewers have pretty much said everything that needs to be said about this disappointing effort. A once-fascinating character, John Corey has devolved into an insufferable clown. In fact, knowing this was another Corey novel is why I waited three months to buy it, and that proved to be an excellent decision, because at least I didn't pay full price. This book is SUCH a mess. Please, Nelson, I'm begging you: NO MORE JOHN COREY!
B00A4YVHXQ|2.0|Like the premise, just was too hard to work with.  I loved the fact that I could just play them on the kindle.  Didn't try too much with actually playing.
B005ZUR724|5.0|like wow on a kindle very nice also can play it in bed.  BAM enough said put yer kindle on her back
0765325950|5.0|Seventeen years ago I was first entranced by the Eye of the World.  The series has had its ups and downs, but Jordan's magnificent conclusion was all a reader could hope for.  Sanderson has thrown in enough (but not too much) background detail that a reader who has missed the last few books could probably pick this one up without major problems.  Enjoy!
B009HELT3C|4.0|Although I was disappointed we didn't get as much Tommy Lee Jones in this movie, Josh Brolin did an excellent job portraying a younger version of him. Overall, the movie was very funny and kept me engaged. I give it four stars because it's definitely one that I would watch again.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|5 stars for content and acting! What I do not appreciate or not like about Season 3 is the recapping of the previous episode right before the current episode begins. It gives the feel of Americanizing the show. I so prefer the 'original UK version'.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Game is fun and addictive, however it has its issues. game will freeze and drop you, people that grow tired of the its a &quot;free&quot; game selling point and then potentially have to use real money will be upset; if it we me I would pay $8 have a version that just lets me play. there is little to no tutorial and cannot get past the point where I have to visit another base to get hearts... whatever those are. graphics are good with intuitive and interactive battles.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I loved this book from beginning to end. Very enlightening and endearing. You resolutely in love with Pi and was amazed by his strength, wit and will. And who doesn't love a Bengal tiger?

B008LV8TSU|4.0|Hayao Miyazaki's animated Howl's Moving Castle is one of my favorite of his films so was quite delighted when I found the book. The book was much longer than the movie and the story line slightly different but still loved all the characters and their personalities. This is one case though where I still like the movie version better than the book version.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love the layout of the tabs that let you comment and repin the pins. It also is very nice to see the pins on a big screen  like my kindle fire
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love the graphics and It's nice to hear the actual voices as well. For a &quot;farmville&quot; style game, it's pretty fun.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game and the grafics are amazingly real! makes it much more fun on a bigger screen to!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Best app game for me so far!!!  Makes me think that I'm smart when I complete a tricky level with the minimum moves, he he he.  Highly recommended.  I've completed the free packs,  thinking of buying more packs...
B008CX2A2I|1.0|Windows 7 doesn't even recognize it as audio device at \\"playback device\\", although stated this thing could work with PC also.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I can't believe I wasn't asked to pay a dime for this book. I *can* believe it received such great reviews! I read this book in one day and really enjoyed it. It's candy romance but that was exactly what I was in the mood for. Easy read, well written, likeable characters and story line. I highly recommend this book to other readers. I look forward to reading more from Mira Lyn Kelly!
0307341577|4.0|I believe there are many readers like me- the type that read the successful \\"Gone Girl\\" by Flynn and immediately flocked to the rest of her books. I was highly impressed with \\"Gone Girl,\\" especially since I hadn't really heard of the writer before. I figured her previous book, \\"Dark Places,\\" was just as good. Overall, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />I couldn't help but compare the two. That might be some unwritten rule, but I find it useful. Compared to \\"Gone Girl,\\" this novel had much of the same in it. Flynn has such a knack for creating characters that you dislike, and yet, you're still on their side. For example, the main character, Libby Day, is introduced in the first paragraphs as a self-proclaimed \\"mean person,\\" and that she is. She's unlikeable, and yet we root for her the entire story. Secondly, the novel is gripped almost in the same gothic feel as the other. I've noticed that the characters, except the main characters, tend to all be ugly and average. I felt that especially in this book, with the ugly Lyle and the ugly Madga, and the ugly Ben, and the ugly... and so forth. It wouldn't be so bad if the scenery that she set wasn't awful either. I'm sure the people of Kansas hate the depressing way Flynn describes the places. Together, the two makes the read feel a little overwhelmed with how awful it truly is.<br /><br />The writing style, I felt, was much better in this book. The pace was slower, though, but I almost enjoyed that. The author has such wonderful ways to describe surroundings and the minute things that humans do. Often, I would stop and marvel in the way she explained things. Her writing style is so razor sharp and on point.<br /><br />However, that also is a downfall. Flynn is amazingly able to write so gruesomely about violence and sex without the slightest flinch. Many times, I would read a section, flip the book over to see her picture and think, \\"How can such a beautiful woman write such devastating material?!\\" There were times thatI was sick after reading certain bits, but I love the effect it had. Grimy. Hardcore Reality. Gripping.<br /><br />Overall, I think the plot to \\"Gone Girl\\" was much more complex and riveting, but this book does not disappoint at all. It's definitely worth the read, and be prepared for Libby and the rest of the characters to not leave your thoughts for a while after you're done.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This ,The Panther , was the best of the John Corey stories. Lots of action and smartass talk  from our hero.
B00973DDN2|4.0|From my perspective, this isn't the Killers best album - that honor goes to Hot Fuss. That said, this album is definitely a good Killers production and is fun to listen to.
B005LAII6C|4.0|Definitively not for kids, but really nice movie with amazing effects and a outstanding 3D.<br />I liked it and enjoyed it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless deals with so many delicate topics. At first i thought i was in for just your typical teenage drama (as i didn't read the back story) well, i was so wrong. I enjoyed the first part which is the awkward tension between sky and dean, the blossoming of the relationship. Then here comes the bitter part, i was arranging the pieces of the puzzle while reading the book. It was heartbreaking, for sky/dean/less and karen. This kind of story happens in real life, it's one of the most delicate topics that really bothers me as it happens a lot nowadays. I think i enjoyed the story, as it was full of love (dean loves sky so much) and sky was lucky that karen helped her escape and dean's helping her each day. I recommend this book, it's great, heartbreaking and amazing
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I saw it at the movie theater and it was every bit as good at home on my 3D tv.  If you haven't seen it, you should buy it.  I guarantee you will love it.  The acting was great but the 3D was the best.  Great family movie
B006LSZECO|4.0|I didn't see that coming!  You will never guess what's going to happen next and when it does you won't believe it.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|This is a classic and often repeated story for good reason.  Everyone should take the time to read the original and the best.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  It was a little frustrating because they wanted to be together but couldn't and who has that much tragedy in their life?
B007J4T2G8|2.0|So many repetitive adjectives, description of facial expressions, Ana, her \\"subconscious\\" and her \\"inner goddess\\"... all so annoying... oh and the e-mailing back and forth... oy.  Don't know what all the hype was about. Glad I bought only one of the books. Should have given it only one star... or no stars. Can you do that?
1432794426|5.0|Defending A King ~ His Life & Legacy\\" is a respectful, well-written book about Michael Jackson.  In each of its 19 chapters the author covers a different aspect or theme about MJ.  The book can be read from beginning to end or by specific chapters, which makes it better organized and more interesting than most other books.  The behind-the-scenes information from people who knew MJ intimately [and who loved him] makes this book special
B0055SWM08|5.0|Good for relaxing and exercising the mind at the same time. Being asked to rate the game so often is a little annoying though.
B005FFW46S|5.0|Is it a comedy? Well, not like his other works, but I did laugh and I did think.  It is written differently than the others both due to an evolution I n writing style and having to dictate than type it himself but still good all the same.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Great for the first half.  Very clever insights into a marriage.  The twist is interesting.  Didn't like the ending--felt unbelievable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This story was a page sweeper from start to end. If is full of well described action and, while sci-fi,kit is hauntingly believable and disquieting.  I will continue the series.
B004FP1WX0|1.0|This would not load correctly (never had problems with anything else) so I wasted my $2.99. Happily, the movie was on MTV later that week, so I did get to see it, and the movie was great.
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Terry goodkind's sword of truth series is a magnificent and winding journey through a lush and fully developed world. Smart, but easy to read and to relate. A must buy for any fantasy enthusist.
B007EE564U|2.0|This is the sort of shoddy writing and extremely pore subbing i'm beginning to expect from people that pump out sitcom like series' of books. Vince Flynn appears to be the Stephenie Meyer of action, after reading the reviews for this book it appears Vince has developed a fan base so obsessed they have blinded themselves to the shocking quality of his writing. I enjoyed the pace of this novel, I can certainly see it as a mindless action film and I feel it was likely written with that goal in mind. The character development was so shallow I didn't need to change my inner dialogue between the main characters. I realise this is an American novel but the patriotic subtlety made me feel like I should be chanting \\"USA, USA\\" while reading it.

B009O2XY12|1.0|hated it! wants your money after five minutes of playing it--and this is supposed to be free?!  wouldn't advise anyone else to get this either
B0031RS2HC|3.0|Very easy reading when you have 5 minutes spare. No real surprises in the plot. Something good to past the time but not life changing.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|I liked it. Better than Cryoburn or Diplomatic Immunity. It is quite similar to Civil Campaign - which is OK, as for me Civil Campaign is the best part of the whole saga. We've had hints before that Ivan is not as dumb as he would like everybody to think he is; now we have proofs :)
B008V0OLOW|5.0|Heard an interview with Ms. Krall on Public Television and just had to have this CD. IIt did not disappoint
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great fun and easy to learn all over again. Cost a little out of pocket but only if you want it too. Works great on kindle fire hd. Music gets annoying but that's easily fixed.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|I bought this for  myself and continued to play it through out the holdiay season. Enjoyed every song on the CD.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|My favorite book and movie of the year - beautifully written, very informative as well as a wonderful exciting story.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Have always loved her music - such a totally different style from most music today. Her sultry voice is easily recognizable and unique.
B00011CZRE|4.0|Just as stated. Used but plays perfect. Why do we have to add more words to say we are happy with our purchase?
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I enjoy dog narratives. This dog taught me the Art of Racing in the Rain... secrets of keeping your eyes on where you are going, not to drop out of the race but finish with with dignity and spirit.  Thank you, Enzo!
0061733199|5.0|Lots of information about everything outdoors. Even has information about edible plants and mushrooms. Which I thought is very useful knowledge to have in the woods.
0765325950|1.0|I've been reading Science Fiction and Science Fantasy since I was a boy, back in the 1970's.  I've read many dozens of Fantasy books.  The Wheel of Time series was only the 2nd Fantasy series (after LOTR) that really grabbed my heart in a meaningful way, kept me engaged and made me love the characters and the world.<br /><br />Then the author got greedy, stopped caring about the characters and the story and let his ego tell him it needed to be a dozen repetitive books instead of 6 or 7 well written ones.  Then he died and some other guy did the same greedy thing and dragged it out for 20 bleeping years.  T W E N T Y.<br /><br />My review of book 12 and the series as a whole is here:<br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R22H6X1L4BF29R/ref=cm_cd_pg_oldest?ie=UTF8&cdPage=1&asin=0765302306&store=books&cdSort=newest#wasThisHelpful<br /><br />Anyway, I don't care anymore.  I got the synopsis of the plot on wikipedia and read the ending.  I didn't like it, because I don't agree with the conclusion that Rand came to and the decision he made based on it.  I will NOT spoil it for someone else, in fact I'm somewhat jealous of anyone who made it this far and still cared what happened, but if you read the book and know the ending, you know what I mean.  I've seen many stories that come to the same conclusion that this book came to: vis a vis Rand vs. the Dark One and I don't agree with it, that's just not my world view.<br /><br />I wish I'd never heard of these books.  I fell in love with the world and the characters and then he screwed it all up, wasted years of my life and my emotional attachment by tearing my heart out with a money grab and an unsatifying ending.  Shame on him and Brendon What's his face.<br /><br />\\"So Mat, Perrin and Rand walk into a bar, I buy them a drink, talk about the old times, hug them good bye, walk away and never hear from them again...\\"
B008BM9L72|4.0|I thought theses books were Fantastic!! I couldnt put it down!! Great books, Great Author!! Would recommend it to anyone!!.
B0001ARCFA|4.0|Great sound, great design. Why the hell is there a word limit. Awesome sounding headphones, however they leak a bit too much, but the sound quality is good. Not amazing bass response.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|This is a great movie for everyone to see.  Hope you have a chance to view it with your family
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I just love this show and I'm glad it's available on Amazon so that I can catch any episodes I might miss.
B005WYFLNU|4.0|Love this idea, grands love it too.  Fun to do and easy to store. Lots of fun for all the girls
0525952926|5.0|Follett is such a great writer. The book is so good historically with wonderfully rich characters. I'd love to read it again and now that I own it, I can.
B003L20IJM|5.0|have not watched it yet so the rating is because I anticipate how good it will be when I see it
B006M7JCC2|5.0|If your looking for peace and understanding, then Anita's journey through illness and confusion, to peace and love will help you to bridge the gap.  Anita's words in fact become a bridge to our true selves. If you are curious to know what that means, you'll have to read the book.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I enjoyed this book and found it very satisfying reading.  I especially enjoyed the period story - very engaging. I would definitely recommend it.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|This movie is a new classic. It has everything in it that makes a great movie. It is also very suitable for families since there is nothing offensive in the way of Christian morals. The seller was professional and the shipping was prompt.
B00005JM02|5.0|Very colorful movie, great for toddlers. Bought it used, cut the price almost in half. For some reason this movie was hard to find.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game us just like temple run get characters, upgrade, boost all that stuff but there are challenges in the game than temple run. So it's $subway surfers vs temple run leave a comment. Thanks!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|LOVE this show....the characters, the dialogs, great show!!....you will be hooked after the first episode....i highly recommend this show...watch it!!
B0058VW36U|4.0|The game is really fun but who will buy super powers to complete a level. It is supposed to be strategy not an easy way to complete the level. Parents make sure that u set a lock on the kindle fire. The super powers is a big waste of the game  for a strategic person. But I must say it has a good price for the powers.
B007TML4EI|3.0|I ended up installing this as the app of the day... played for a few minutes and uninstalled. Not a terrrible app, just needs work.
B003NX75B8|4.0|I just finished reading the book and the first thing I have  to say is that I love both John Green and David Levithan. They are both really good authors; however, I feel Levithan didn't do a very good job at portraying his Will Grayson. Will 2 (Levithan's) was bone dry and didn't seem to have any complexities. He was more like a shallow character that was over dramatic and very cliche. I didn't feel like he should have  been a main character. Also I noticed that Levithan couldn't utilize a shift key. I found it annoying; even if it was a way to convey that Will 2 was less mature than Will 1. After a couple chapters it turns  oh  to be okay, but it really ruined the book for me. It does get a 4 out of 5 because  it is true to what teenage lid  is an  because  I really liked Tiny.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Fun really fun extra fun did I mention it is fun is fun yes I have had fun playing this game fun fun fun fun
B007J4T2G8|5.0|exciting keeps you wondering whats going to happen next and it's a must to read the next book I must know whats going to happen
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Initially I was just going to buy Madness, since I seem to have developed an addiction to that song. Then I realized I've liked every Muse track I have heard, so I got the album instead. I'm very glad I did! The second to last track is now in my top 3 songs, and all the other tracks are awesome too. I don't usually love entire albums on the first pass. Usually I just waitf or the songs I know and the other ones grow on me with time. This one I loved on the first listen. I highly recommend it.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I loved this book so much. It put so much in perspective for me and it made me feel happy and warm inside. I think everyone should read it.
B0082SU98U|5.0|i love love love this book it is . amazing i just love it and hope te read more of your books love you
B000FA675C|5.0|Wonderful! This is such a good book. The ideas in it are totally feasible. It makes one think,and can easily open many a closed mind!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|Loved it. Going to read all his books now. Although I'm going to have to get used books or use the library because $10 for a e-book when there is no distribution costs, no printing costs, no retail overhead, and no inventory carrying coasts, and no human labor involved in the sale is actually a ridiculous price when you think about it.
B00A9C3RB8|2.0|Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carrell, trapped in a movie that never really gets going. Too bad.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|Pretty juvenile. I like these actors though, but can't understand why Seth McFarland's  movie had to be quite so &#34;lame&#34;
1439102813|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read.  Compelling story interestingly told from the patient's point of view. Well written, informative and realistic.  It will make anyone who reads it more empathetic and understanding of patients with Alzheimer's disease or any type of dementia.  I highly recommend this book.  I can't wait to read more of Lisa Genova's work.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like the NIV version the best of all bibles I think and I have read through about three versions altogether. It is very easy reading like in todays language. I love it.
B00009YOQW|5.0|When we received our drum, it had three cracks up the side as though it had split in spots due not curing properly/weather changes (we live in Canada and I know these are made in Thailand). We were sent a new drum and it had the same issue. Plan Toys was very helpful and sent us a replacement toy as they said they had had a bad batch of drums. However, we were still able to keep the broken drum and it is still working well with no problems. It is a favourite toy and has been through its share of falls. My son loves it and we love that it's simple and wooden. It seems quite durable and we're hoping it doesn't completely split any time soon. We will definitely replace it with a new one when that time comes however.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love this series!!!! I highly recommend it!!!! I watched all of season 1 & 2 in one weekend!!!!  All of my friends were righ to tell me not to miss this !!! :)
B008YRVW0I|3.0|This is part of the fishdom series that i liked i think there are several out there to play ok
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I started watching during the second season and missed this episode and the only way to watch (at this time) is purchasing it. I did and I was very happy with the quality and the price. Bravo Amazon.
B007MU85D0|4.0|It's a nice, enjoyable album to have on in the background.  I bought it on sale, thought I'd give it a try, and liked it a lot.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I've got to make this review brief, but this headset is exactly what I expected and want out of a headset!  The sound quality is amazing, the bass is certainly powerful(though sometimes get distorted depending on the quantity of bass).  The surround sound works great and I've had no problems so far.  Sometimes the volume button stops working for a few seconds, but turning it off and on again fixes it.  A minor inconvenience.<br /><br />No sound distortion and I've been using these things fairly loudly.  You could even use it as a set of mini speakers if you really wanted to!<br /><br />I would recommend these to anyone who's looking for a good headset for PC gaming or who need a good PC headset and microphone combo.  About the microphone:  Works exactly as they say it does.  Distorting voices with the headset entertains my 3 year old niece a lot!
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I bought this CD for my family to enjoy this Christmas.  It also came with a digital copy. It is a great movie that follows the book pretty close.  Thumbs up for the movie and the transaction
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for a big fan of Rod Stewart !! 2 thumbs up on this cd !! super fast delivery !Well packaged also !!
B008XNZMOU|5.0|I bought 2 of these CD's. One for each of my girls.  Can't go wrong with this purchase if you like Taylor Swift.
B009O07NDY|5.0|This has been a great buy for me and my wife. We are both LotR fans, both books and movies. After watching The Hobbit in theaters, I made this purchase the next day. I love it. It definately has added more adventure to my morning and afternoon rush hour drive.
1451627297|2.0|I was halfway through this book when I realized I had been ripped off. The cover and the marketing for this book make it look like it is about some brave new world and how things might have turned out if Kennedy hadn't died. That's not what this book is at all. It is just waxing nostalgic about what it was like to live in the 50s and 60s. That's it. The stuff about stopping the Kennedy assassination is just a minor subplot. Don't buy the book if you are expecting any kind of fresh perspective on the Kennedy assassination. You are going to be disappointed.
B001Q7JD3Q|4.0|Alnost as good as the orginal, had they not messed with the original story line. For example, in this version Ann had quickly lost her fear of Kong and became a companion of his. In the original Ann didn't appreciate Kong at all and was terrified of him.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I LOVE this book and can hardly wait to read the next one....I like books that reel you in like you are right there!
B009DP9D6A|4.0|The mau5 rocks every where I go! This album isn't his best! But I think that's just cuz he tried a few different stylez on this one! Still a great listen! And there just might be coffee! Since Ima professional griefer
B003JTHXOK|4.0|It has everything. From suspense to love and true yet surprising friendships created. You won't be disappointed by this Sparks page turner.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|This book remind me of life and how everyday life. I could not stop reading it.  It is amazing and intriguing. I can't wait to read the next book.
1451638450|4.0|I must start this review by saying that Bujold is head and shoulders above the hackneyed,derivative stuff that passes for science fiction these day. That being said, I have not cared for her last two books, Diplomatic Immunity and Cryoburn, they were not up to what she can do. I am better pleased by this latest effort,though it sags a bit in the middle, but the ending is first rate,and don't miss it. I suppose she spoiled me with A Civil Campaign, I have never read a funnier book, science fiction or not, and if you have not read it, run,don't walk to get a copy.I hope this means her writing curve is going up again, and I will always be in the line to read what this marvelous writer puts out out about Barrayar and Vorkosigans
1452110581|5.0|Very funny book. Great for cat lovers. I also think none cat people would find this book funny. Typical cat things from a cats point of view.
6304936303|5.0|Good dvd. I loved this movie. Glad I could get the dvd after so many years of looking.<br />Happy new year.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone!!! So sexy I could just lay in bed all day dreaming about this man named Christian Grey.
B0099114WO|1.0|Streep and Jones play a long-married couple who rekindle things in the bedroom by going to a counselor.<br /><br />This is neither romantic nor a comedy. It's boring and awkward and should have been rated R.<br /><br />It's graphic and embarrassing to watch and definitely not for children or first dates.  It's like watching real therapy - not that entertaining.<br /><br />These are both excellent actors, but they couldn't shine with this material. I didn't see anything in their marriage worth saving, especially after looking at Jones' craggy, saggy face for two hours.<br /><br />Graphic bed scenes are filmed in dim light but still not for the squeamish.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I loved the access of both seasons at the same time.  My mother is very ill and we spent hours together enjoying this series.  It allowed us to have an activity together and gave us something to talk about.
B00A0SQBDM|5.0|Can't stop playing. I love the suspense. My favorite part is searching for objects. Very nicely laid out. I am a fan of hidden objects. Can't wait to see what happens nexts.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Upon purchasing by this book I was very skeptical about what it was going to be about. At first I thought it would be another teen love story that ended in suicide but it had a great twist with romance. A must read book.
0061928356|4.0|So the book is definityly good odition and has been around; a little frayed here and there. Nevertheless I gave an extra star because it is an autographed copy. Love it when that happens! Delivery was perfect.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|Very good easy to read!<br />Simple and challenging at<br />The the same time . Interesting and even a bit fun
B0063IH60K|4.0|I like the different options.  In addition the layout of the game is very good.  The replay/how to win option is also a plus.
B00992CF6W|5.0|SO WORTH 6&middot;99 WHO EVER BOUGHT THIS WAS SMART! BETTER THAN LITE<br />I LOVE THIS GAME<br />IT IS SO FUN<br />ALSO IT DOESN'T SUCK
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I really love this show. They have really made the show so different from last season. I thought it would be hard to watch the same people play different caracters, but Jessica Lange is so wonderful as Sister Jude. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing this caracter.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is a easy to read book with a good plot and interesting characters. I recommend it as a good romantic read .
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I always enjoyed this series and this was as good as the rest. I usually don't like dark movies, but this one was worth it.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Colleen Hoover strikes again! I decided to buy this book because I enjoyed reading Hopeless. I was definitely not disappointed.
B0095ZMMCK|2.0|Clancy has become so enthralled with technology that he forgets he is writing novels.  This book is full of computer techie junk, and loses the plot.  It can best be described as turgid.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|I just finished watching the entire first two seasons, I love this series !! Suspense, intrigue, friendship and love. What more could you ask ? Oh, I forgot, violence, torture and bloodshed...
B0092S4WLY|1.0|kindle fire sucks do not buy this get an ipad or something instead worst tablet ever shuts itself down freezes etc horrible DO NOT BUY ...this game is nice though
B000KJT8IG|5.0|We couldn't find this product in the stores and<br />we watched it during xmas and it was just like it aired on tv.<br />Love it!  My boys are 11 and 9 and they really loved it.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|Hooked to the first season!!! The second season does not have any disappointments, love the cinematography, characters and storyline. I will continue to watch the series ...
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I love the historical slant this book takes by combining fictional characters into real historical events. Looking forward to moving into the next book!
B000FCKGPC|5.0|I really enjoy this book. Maybe it doesn't have a lot of action like the other once but it gives more insight of the characters.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great sequel I can't stop reading these books! Very emotionally charged, the caster world is an intriguing place. Quite the page turner.
B00A0A6F7C|5.0|Everyone would be impressed with such beautiful musical sounds. I purchased this album for my Kindle. I enjoy listening to this often.
B005LAIGW8|5.0|If your a Cage fan, you just gotta have this movie.  It's graphics are way better than the last flick and the movie is just fun.  Hope you enjoy this movie too, as i've watched it about 10 times.
0817439390|4.0|had an old slr many years ago, this book was a great refresher for me and my new dslr.  offers lots of tips and examples of photos taken various ways
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought this was very good. I really liked how it ended but would of preferred her choosing the other.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Great product.  Another great season for a hilarious TV show.  Love the characters and the story lines.  Look forward to many more seasons!!!!!
B003GDYMYS|1.0|Cracked case, possibly damage to cd, didn't open it.  Mailed from Berlin, Germany in plane envelope, no wonder it's cracked!  Why from Germany when this group is from New Jersey?????
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book is well written and the author has done a good job putting the content together. This book has definitely changed my perspective about thinking about others.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book captures the all the concepts of life on every page. Passion. Humor. Love. Capital-E Everything. This book is Capital-S Something.
B003UESJHE|5.0|A must for people of all ages.  The acting is superb.  The topic is interesting and holds the viewers attention.  I have recommended The King's Speech to lots of people and bought the DVD for my husband's birthday.  It is one movie that we will view over and over.
B008B0QH5S|3.0|There are two, three good songs on this album, but overall it is a mediocre album. It seems Pet Shop Boys just make albums to keep the cash coming in nowadays. Too bad, because they are truly talented. However, if you are a fan, you should get this album, too.
014017821X|4.0|This is a book for those looking at classical fairy tales revisited in a darker context. It's intellectually stimulating in that regard, but it's kind of wierd if that's not what sort of a book you're after.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was simple yet fantastic a book you can relate to at all ages. This book made me happy in ways I  can't say and I never could put it down! This is definitely I feel good book even though he had to overcome things but who doesn't? I highly recommend to all readers!
0316067938|5.0|Sad to think that this is the last book in the series. They were all page turners in my opinion.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is really fun and addicting! It's a perfect time killer. So far there have been no technical problems on the kindle fire.
B005CGI3ZG|5.0|When you want to sit down with me and have a real conversation about acting, lets start with Dawson's Creek. How about Dawson Leery's performance? I'm sorry, he is such an amazing actor I actually thought for a fortnight that he is his character!!! LOL!!! James. Van. Der. Beek. The periods are intentional. I want the reader to pause while reading his name. I want you to feel it in your bones and especially in your heart. He's that good. I defy you to watch this series and not be moved by his performances. He has the grace of an angel and lets not get into his looks!!! LOL!!!! uhmmm, perfect!!!! The girls in the show are ok, but lets talk about Pacey. Real name? Joshua Jackson. I didn't want to do the period thing again because you guys were expecting it!!!! LOL!!!! I don't know about you, but I can get lost in his eyes. I can feel it in my heart. The writing in the show is essentially flawless. Go ahead, go out there and watch some TV and find a more well written program. C'mon? Did you do it? No? Oh, I didn't think so! So why don't you get lost (in Dawson and Pacey's eyes!)
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I got it to give as a gift,  and they loved it.  Now I want to order another one for myself.
0307950689|2.0|Like about a billion others, I read The Da Vinci Code and really liked it. During a run of very long flights over a period of weeks following my reading of The Da Vinci Code, I proceeded to read Dan Brown's first three novels, and thought they were all just okay. I probably would've given Angels and Demons, Deception Point, and Digital Fortress two or three stars each if I'd reviewed them here. For The Lost Symbol, I had to convince myself not to give it one star, and managed to do so only because I had to give Brown some credit for keeping me interested with all of the information he includes about the Masons. That's it, that's all I got out of this book. The plot twists in this one just didn't work for me; I found myself laughing at what were supposed to be its most intense, emotional situations. Unless Brown's next book features years of research on a topic I just can't help but want to explore, I don't think I'll be reading his future work.
B001EN71CW|4.0|I had never heard of this show until it was referenced on Big Bang Theory, and then I got interested.  The reviews increased that interest until I finally decided to buy it.<br /><br />The show is engaging, and the characters are generally believable in the setting where they live.  I am happy that I watched the series, and if I had been watching it when it was aired, would have been disappointed when it wasn't picked up for another season... but as it is, I knew that it had a definite end, so I could be prepared to be left hanging.<br /><br />It beats much of what is on TV, so go ahead and buy it and watch it instead of some current garbage for a couple of months.  :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Ths book went back and forth and had me saying &#34;what!&#34;. The twist in the middle that just pet on made this book exciting
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Didn't realize how difficult the game is.  It's kind of frustrating but I'm determined to beat the game.  I'll keep at it.
B0042816YK|5.0|I would recommend this product if you like this movie.  It arrived in perfect condition without any defects or problems.
B000WTLDPU|1.0|I like to think of myself as pretty tech-savvy and I have yet to find a machine that this will play on. DVD player, PC, PS3... Tried it in all of them and it hasn't played in a single one. Just spits it back out without being able to recognize the disc. Ah well, get what you pay for I suppose.
B007U2ABXM|5.0|No one doubts Patti Smith is brilliant.<br /><br />Her new album, yes album, as it comes in a small book with photographs, which is actually the true definition of album...in disc form.<br /><br />It contains the greatest song ever written about a dog.  It is \\"Old Shep\\" from a far more literate Elvis and Elvis is no saint.  Patti Smith is the only saint I have seen perform.  Patti spat on me several times.<br /><br />It also contains, as far as I know, the greatest song ever written about Maria Schneider, who passed on a year or so ago, unfortunately.  She had a somewhat troubled life and the most beautiful breasts I have ever seen on the big screen.<br /><br />Much was made of Patti Smith's breasts back when she was considered a punk-rocker, since the journalists who were looking for words to describe a female poet reverted to that, or those, as they were hormonal kids writing for Cream Magazine, another great Michigan thing.<br /><br />The album is her best album in a while.  So what. They are all good.  One could do worse than to be a fan of Patti Smith.  Take this review and remember it when you listen.  The recommendation is thus:  Read the lyrics when you listen, and the back catalog is available.
B009RI4FRU|3.0|...but for some reason, Moonrise Kingdom just didn't do it for me.  I just didn't feel a connection or a draw to the characters in it as I have for past characters he's created.<br /><br />But, it wasn't bad, still better than probably 60% of the movies out there.  Maybe it will get better on subsequent viewings.
B0043VDIAG|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book, but at the end felt that something has been stolen from me... I needed more juice to it.
B00005MHNB|1.0|The DVD would not play in anything I had. I have 4 DVD players and recorders and 3 Lap Top Computers and It wouldn't play on any of them. The folks did get me my money back when I returned it but they should know by now if the dvd is playing<br />for people or not. I give the one star for the DVD not the service. They did right by me so I give them a 5 stars for that.
0316232955|5.0|Chris made me cry and laugh trough all the story, somehow eveyrtime I'm feeling sad I go to the last part of the book and read it, it makes me smile, because Carson ends up really happy and positive.
B009HOU672|5.0|Totally blown away. So fresh. Exciting. And at times wildly entertaining. Breathes new, vigorous life into a dead chestnut. Can't recommend it highly enough--even if you don't like classical music.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|It has simple story and at the middle of the book, I could guess what the end of story would be.<br />Everything about the Grey's personage created perfect, extraordinary and supernatural despite Anna's ordinary, normal personage with full of imperfections. Just like normal people in our real life. Most part of the book is about the email correspondings and repeating the same told conversation or story from the beginning of the book.
B008LA7RM0|5.0|........is the greatest &#34;RnR&#34; album ever made.  A 24 year old genius put together the most symphonic piece of &#34;ear-candy&#34;; and,<br />the label just dumped &#34;sand&#34; on it and washed it out to sea.  This is the most under-appreciated album (a real tragedy).  Brian Wilson became rock n' roll's first artistic martyr.
0374533571|2.0|I almost can't believe those words came out of my mouth. But they did so let me elaborate. The book didn't give enough room to other characters so much, like Tiffany who has enough charm and mystery to intrigue the readers. We are given very vague snippets of her past and background. The book is all Pat and the Eagles football team. God knows I love and watch football regularly and I see how the love for Eagles fit the story, but it went on and on and on. The middle part was nothing but congestion of Eagles worship and I found myself dozing off and skipping pages. If it propelled the story further and gave some insight into Pat's relationship with his father, I would have understood it better and maybe even appreciated it, but none of those emotional aspects were there.<br /><br />The film was so fantastic, I just had to read the book and it left me greatly disappointed. The writing is fantastic, the pace of story is fast and interesting, but the magic of silver linings the film represented so well, was not compelling enough in this book.
B00338QENI|5.0|I would never have read this book if my sister had not recommended it.  I liked it a lot.  I am a biology major so it really appealed to me.  I love the way this author writes, and I can't wait to see the movie.  I learned a lot about how some black people lived in the 40s and how they were treated.  It's unbelievable that the medical profession took such advantage of patients both black and white.  Then again, where would we be today if they had not!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game is very addicting.  At first I thought it would be boring. But once I started playing and reaching different levels I didn't want to stop.
B005LAJ17M|4.0|The characters and plot very interesting and entertaining.  The only downside it's too close to recent domestic terrorism and somewhat disturbing (the event not the Homeland series).
B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was a good read.  I enjoyed it more than his last two.  I enjoyed the mystery or was it that I was conned?
B0063IH60K|2.0|It is Solitaire, so as name implies, if you have no one to play with, this will help pass the time and challenge your thought process and memory without having to deal the cards physically. I do however wish that this and all other \\"free\\" games had a purchase option so that I would not have to endure the endless, annoying ads. After all, the Kindle was not free!!!
B00729GQ0A|5.0|Well! this is my first review ever, so forgive me if I miss anything! First, I have to say I love reading paranormal fiction, and this book did not disappoint. I thought the book was very well written, and it never got boring to read it. the characters are consistent and real. Sometimes characters seem all over the place and don't really  go well with what's happening in the book, though in this case they were varied and true to themselves and you even come to love their flaws, which is what makes them so real because no one can be perfect. i loved the action and suspense. every part of the book is persistent to something and in the end you get all these little surprises ad understand so much. also loved the romance. It is not necessarily a romance, though it does add a lot of meaning to everything that happens and is what made me personally love the characters even more.<br />this book centers on a young woman that discovers throughout the events in the book that she comes from a very special line of ancestors. she meets important people and through them she begins to understand the oddities that filled her life. in the end, with the help of the mysterious young man she meets, they try to stand for what is right and their beliefs.<br />Sort of general but I hope this helps! Totally a book I will recommend to anyone for a fun, exciting read.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|the only downside from this movie is that it made me really sad because i cant sing. pie pie cupcake
B005KELR3A|5.0|Perfect case for my kindle and awesome price compared to others I looked at. Well made, good material, and protects the kindle.
B002QRWJA4|4.0|good good good good good it was good i liked it why does this require so many words my goodness
B006IYG5HE|2.0|The Redbreast: Story line is incoherent and relies too much on coincidence to resolve conflicts. Also, the neo-nazi cop/gun smuggler character does not add much.
B003DNN0L2|5.0|bill murray and wes anderson and george clooney all need to have my babies wes anderson equals the best most genious man  alive
0061148512|5.0|I picked this book up because I knew it'd been a classic read, but somehow throughout school I'd missed having it on any of my reading lists. The story makes one think about mental health not only as a current issue, but rather as something that has been around but less frequently addressed.
B005PK553C|5.0|ahs give me back my life please. okay thats my review okay im done hope this was helpful bye now
0374533571|5.0|I know, I went backwards from the norm and saw the movie before reading the book. I liked both, personally. However, as you read the book, you realize just how much the movie changed parts of the story. I think the book portrays the characters in a more serious, dark manner than the movie, but I think the movie succeeded in making the characters more likeable (probably for the sake of better reviews). The best thing to do is accept both as two different products, and hopefully enjoy them both.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|i give it all of my stars. ahs you win. i love you. have my babies. okay. well.. uhm. muffin
B00A8ECU24|1.0|it is a very addictive little game. big downfall is it not connecting correctly so I'm  unable to network which makes the game very slow moving. also you need to buy stuff or wait forever to move forward.<br /><br />I finally deleted it because I was unable to connect to other players which made it impossible to complete the game.
B000LJ9ZWE|3.0|My wife loves this film.  It was fun to remember the way we dressed and cut our hair back then.  Also, the older technology used brought back some memories.  I give is 3 stars because there are so many movies out there with better effects.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Which is saying something for me. It takes a lot for me to enjoy a book and this had my attention from start to end.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|I found it interesting with a peek into someone's life who does things that the rest of us can only wonder about.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|If you love Jazz and want to hear a voice that's true and unfettered, you MUST buy this CD. I hope to hear him live one day.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|More like a funky reference book on life than a real cookbook, but fun.  I especially like the author's personal side takes on many subjects, which may or may not hold water, but that he so enthusiastically supports.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I wanted to read the book before watching the movie. Victor Hugo is masterful in his descriptions and the characters make you believe that ,despite the night, there is always a coming dawn.
B001U3Y5XE|4.0|We have an 8-year old boy and 17-year old daughter. We got this game for our son as a Christmas present.  Turns out that we all enjoy playing this game.  We have played it several times as a family.  Let me tell you it is hard to find something that our two children will do together willingly that they both enjoy.  The game turned out to be a big hit with the whole family.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|don't listen when they say update deleted everything it doesnt!!1 star? no way!! rovio did a great job!! this game is AWSOME!!!!!!!!
B0063GORYU|3.0|a no thought game, release the day's stresses and toils, only have to beat time and last length of achievement, a, want to play again, game
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|was just exactly what i needed for my kindle fire. give it the needed protection with out reducing any functions
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|I love it but don't listen. to me or anyone else try it out yourself cuz peoples got different opinions so try it yourselves but it is really awesome and I'm a level 6 already
0061124958|4.0|Best Book! My daughter loves it!! The best part is it is hard cover and no worries on getting it rough handled.
B00786XVOG|5.0|I continue to be amazed by Yanni,s composing.<br />I love my cd and even more the dvd.<br />Watching him perform bringing everyone,s talent together is great.<br />Keep up the good work.<br />All your fans love your music. It truly has real meaning.
1439192812|5.0|Loved the book. I though it was a great refresher for those things that we should know and did learn in the past. I also learned new things that didn't know exactly how they worked but had a general idea.
0307592731|4.0|Nice account of solo hike; more author-focused than Bryson's A Walk in the Woods, but if you liked that one, you will like this.
1416583432|5.0|Wife was  the receiver of this book and so far I'am still reading  it.It has some good explanations  I found in this book and never knew.
B004I654WQ|3.0|I love this movie, however this copy doesn't have a &#34;scene&#34; selection option...which is a little annoying.  It wasn't a horrible price, but for a few dollars more, you can get one with a scene selection.
B008C20TDG|5.0|Great book that explains how to change your life!  It is a lifestyle that finally worked for me.  I have tried numerous lifestyles.  This one is not difficult.  I'm left feeling satisfied.  Plus the weightloss was a BONUS!!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|I wasn't sure about this book at first, but I really going a connection with Charlie. He's such a pure, innocent character that's it hard not to love him. All in all I loved the book.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent!!!! Can't wait to read the rest!!!<br />Thanks for opening my imagination again after all these years. So very refreshing!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|The quality of the video was wonderful. Downton Abbey is extraordinary- visually stunning and an engrossing story! I am truly a Downton Abbey junkie :)
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I really enjoyed this film. It plays on some of the theories going around about ancient astronauts and their possible involvement in human development. If you're not at all familiar with these theories, it might be a good idea to familiarize yourself with them a little bit before watching Prometheus to understand the (at least make-believe) scope of this movie.<br /><br />Is it an Alien prequel? Sure. Is it blatant and in your face from the start? Not at all. If that's what you're expecting, you'll be let down.
B007SGM084|5.0|Simply incredible. Looking forward to more from E L James, you will not put this book down. A great book.
B000SGGUWS|5.0|Amazing series I'm addicted to the books and show uh-oh!!<br /><br />I'm watching -A<br />HAHA LOL this book is amazing! :)
B000KFB4PK|5.0|Bought this for my nephew for Christmas.  He loved it.  Can't tell time well yet, but is learning. Like how it has extra links, and is not too flimsy.
1423140605|5.0|Couldn't wait for this book to come out, and I couldn't put it down.  Recommended for pre-teen to adult, great series!
B0034DGPEU|5.0|Loved most of this book.  It's a quick read that draws you in from the beginning.  The brutality in some of the scenes made my stomach turn and I'm not 100% sure I loved the ending, but I would recommend that others read this book!
1419705849|5.0|Great book for young teens, my daughter and her friends look forward to each installment! I would definitely recommend this book series.
B00A9X9TIW|3.0|Ok movie, could have been better. Came up short in ending. Decent idea but it never quite realized potential.  Better luck next time.
B001IXXYBA|4.0|A great love story with a twist.  This was the first time I had ever heard of a medium ... and Whoopi Goldberg was great in the part.  Great entertainment with a great plot.  It's an old fashioned classic movie filled wtih romance, horror and a real tearjerker!  They don't make them that way any more!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read a good bit.  I was thrilled that this was not a story I have read before.  It did not remind me of anything and I could not put it down.  Highly recommend it to all.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, which centers on change and acceptance.  Those who can accept change,  and those who can’t.  The cast is great … each is as unique as the other stars of the show, the hotel and India itself!  All provide an interesting contrast of what was versus what is.  Well worth the look see.
B004G600A4|5.0|Our 4-year-old granddaughter loves this movie! It's an entertaining version of the classic Repunzel fairy tale that even adults will enjoy. It has joined our Disney collection and is sure to be a longtime favorite!
0446554995|5.0|I have been following Agent Pendergast for years and he has become dull and predictable.  This trilogy was very good.  With Two Graves being the very best.  Knowing Pendergast as the long suffering FBI agent, it was very satisfying to see some happiness enter his life.  Of course, we all know Alban will be back.
B004132HZS|5.0|Brilliantly made, brilliantly acted.  The stories are all good, and the twists and turns are unique and well played out.  Second season is just as good, and can't wait for the third.<br /><br />Sherlock is expertly quirky and intelligent, Watson is more of an every-man which Martin Freeman always plays to a great result.
B0091REZMW|3.0|its ok.  a bit repetitive and some of the rooms have a steep exploration cost.  I havent paid a cent in real $$ nor would i, but its an ok way to pass some time
B0089EHWQE|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a long time.  It's touching, witty, sad and full of self-induced drama--all the elements you need in a good book.  I love the main character Lou; she's quirky, funny, way too sheltered and completely unaware of who she is.  It's a book about the choices we make in life, how we live and the importance of not letting \\"one thing define you\\".  It surreptitiously climbs into your heart delighting it, crushing it and at times, satisfyingly reviving it.
B004JC16LC|5.0|Furtwaengler is considered by many - including me - as the most important Classical conductor of the 20th century, particular in Austro German romantic repertoire. This amazing set, containing 107 CDs, is the most complete available Furtwaengler collection ever assembled. At its low price, it is a fantastic bargain and will not fail to please those listeners that can hear past the variable, always mono, sound quality of these extraordinary recordings.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it was alright but I wish the games were more complex and there were more options when I started playing.
B005HYNCTK|5.0|Bruckner lovers tend to be polarized on Celibidache's interpretations of these great symphonies: some consider his slow tempi sheer genius, others feel that it distorts the natural flow of the music. In my opinion, The one symphony where Celi's concept works to magnificent results is the famous symphony No 4 where his broad tempi end up to an interpretation of crushing emotional power. Regardless of whether one likes or dislikes Celi's approach - these recordings belong to the most important recorded Bruckner statements of the last several decades, at par with Karajan's and Guenter Wand's.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|Love the music and waiting for the movie to come out on DVD<br /><br />I would be happy to let others know.
B008US25FW|5.0|I don't speak or understand French, but I adore this CD. You don't need to understand it to FEEL it. Not only is her singing beautiful as usual, but you can appreciate the true artistry of her singing. There are 3 duets on the CD that at first annoyed me because they &#34;interrupted&#34; Celine, but I got over it and now enjoy them for what they are. We have been listening to this CD since we got it, nonstop. It's that good!
B000XUBFE2|1.0|Poorly written book this was racist against Jews. There was question about whether the author/writer leans toward the nazi irrational line.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I really enjoed this book and was never bored of it.Can't wait to read the other books by Suzane Collins
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|So far this game his slot of fun who's you could get more of what you need without spending any money
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I found myself drowning under the sheer number of unread items in my feeds. But I wanted to keep the feeds. So Feedly[[ASIN:B0050DZN4K Feedly. Your News Deck.]] has proved perfect for the job. Feeds presented in magazine layout, with different folders presenting as different magazine sections.<br />It means not only are the feeds presented in a much more consumable way, but from both phone and tablet, I always have something interesting (and relevant to me) to read.<br />And I'm visiting the information more, because the massive totals of unread articles aren't waving in my face, causing info guilt.<br />It is one of the few apps that has really made a difference to something that was a genuine issue for me.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An outstanding adventure of man against the elements of both sea and mind. Truly causes one to reflect on his God and inner belief of why so many consider their religion as the only  true path to Heaven......nonsense to this reader.  I recommend this story to anyone wishing to have an adventure. Without ever leaving his or her couch!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Although Tom Cruise's singing was a pleasant surprise, the rest of the movie was predictable, trite, and boring. Don't waste your money. The plot line was almost identical to Coyote Ugly. I can see why it flopped at the movie theaters.
B009E20IB6|2.0|I was very disappointed as I did not realize that this was just short stories. I got the feeling that all three stories were the prologues for full length books.
B009NPA3Y6|4.0|A decent compilation (that should satisfy fans old and new) with a minor glitch of the songs on disc one being labeled out of sequence.
B004TJ1GVK|5.0|It is wonderful and very beautiful film. I the first time looked it very much for a long time for VHS but now to a smog to enjoy quality Blu-Ray Disk. I will necessarily recommend to its friends.
B004VPAXHU|5.0|I have been a Kate Bush fan from close to the beginning; I bought this when it was released (C.D.'s were kind of new, as I recall). I always considered this one of the great achievements in singing, songwriting, and production. Still do, and it still is.<br /><br />I have always been drawn to her vocal calisthenics, uber-creativity, and mystery. A healthy dose of lust - what young man didn't want to be the guy in \\"Man With The Child In His Eyes\\", or the object of her desire in \\"Feel It\\" - was part of the attraction, and as a long time Genesis/Gabriel fan, the association with Peter was also a draw (early on, I used to think of her as kind of a female Gabriel before I knew better).<br /><br />I loved this recording from the start, but I confess that it was more about the sound, and more of an intellectual connection.<br />But over time, something in Hounds Of Love grew in me in a way that was unexpected, and that's why i felt compelled to write this review.<br /><br />I'm around the same age as Kate Bush, and I reckon that as she matured, and her craft, voice, and richness in life experience grew, I was also growing up and started to connect to her music in a much more emotional way.<br /><br />I have recently been listening to this over and over and over, like it was brand new, and I HAD TO KNOW EVERY NOTE AND EVERY WORD OF EVERY SONG. My love and appreciation of this masterpiece over time has evolved, and this now touches emotions deep in me that I won't describe lest I sound like a big blubbering pussy.<br /><br />Other reviews have been more detailed about the meaning of the songs: I want you to know that you deserve to feel how Kate Bush and this great and timeless recording will make you feel.<br /><br />So if you're still wondering, buy this NOW, and then buy every other thing that Kate Bush has blessed us with, which is everything she's done.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. Finished it in 2 days. Love Nicholas Sparks. Definitely recommend it. Feeling very blessed looking at my life after reading it.
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|Pretty good collection. Outstanding Image and Sound. Case is cute. I recommend it. Do not hesitate in buying this if you are a fan.
B004KKYX9K|4.0|A little slow to start with..but I can understand why she had to explain the dynamics of the family..I loved the Novel..not my favourite Jodi Picoult book..but I loved it all the same.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Its a good game.  Lots of silly anime situations I really wasn't expecting.  I'm from America and this has shown me a little of what Japan is like; to say the least the experience is interesting.  Oh and plus the gameplay is fun and the soundtrack is also good.
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|Amazing just amazing never read a book like it the excruciating detail had me just not stop reading it. I started up late every night just to read it, Jack London your are a matter
B008J05EL8|1.0|I haven't had the time to figure this one out or even use it. I thought it was like an office suit but I guess I was wrong.
B00457WZEI|5.0|War horse was a very moving story to me for its creative drive ex: it was told through the horse's perspective which I thought; for one who hates reading; kept me in depth reading this book and latched me on to some of the characters. I am the kind of person who has an admiration for secondary characters. Although some didn't \\"live\\" up to their expectations. There was really nothing I could say that was bad about the book. It was an overall good book. I would recommend this book to anyone who is looking for a quick read that has a great plot. Settings. And characters. 5 of 5
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|awesome! i really love this game! so addicting! i play this game about every chance i get its just so much fun!
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|This book is great I love it I wish I could 're read it over again love this book do you?

111846446X|5.0|I just finished reading this book; it is an excellent introduction to the Raspberry and to Python.  The Hardware Hacking and Add-On Boards chapters provide everything you need to get started.<br /><br />If you are new to Linux, chapters 2 - 6 alone are worth the price of the book.  The explanations are well written and presented in a manner that is easily digestible by a Linux novice.<br /><br />I particularly liked the chapter about the Scratch programming language. My 11 year old is beginning to work with Scratch, and I was delighted to learn that this language will run on the Pi quite well. It really is a good deal to have a free, MIT designed programming language for kids that runs on a $35 computer!<br /><br />This book really ought to be on the shelf of any Raspberry Pi enthusiast.
0061122416|4.0|Everyone should read this book.  Especially if there are in a place of transition with their life or perspective. s
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great graphics.  I love all the puzzles  throughout the game.  The story is interesting without too many cut scenes and you can skip them if you like.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Good for anyone with a vacation and a desire to get wound around the finger of the utterly unexpected turns in a great mystery.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Great book for anyone that has ever played videogames, RPGs or that likes the eigthies. Nostalgic and futuristic at the same time. Couldn´t stop reading it.
B00899ES5C|5.0|Love this series!! It is a great series that keeps you captivated and very much intrigued! I cannot wait to get caught up.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I read this book in about a week, which is very impressive for me. It kept my interest the entire time.
B00004XP35|5.0|This vinyl record was a good one. It has a quiet side to it, but it still has roots of heavier alternative rock mixed in. Definitely worth the price I paid (close to $15).
B0062OCNAI|4.0|I enjoyed this book, although it got a little too wordy at times.  She could have tied it up a little bit sooner, but still, I didn't want to put it down, as I was eager to see how she was going to resolve the story.  I enjoyed it.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|i like it but the game has started me over from the beginning twice...i dont know if i will stay with it.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|How can you NOT feel the depth of genius in this epic tale of historic significance?  As moving now as &#34;back in the day&#34; when reading it for the first time. From exposition to resolution, captivating.
B0098VYKSA|4.0|I thought this may be a whimsical fairy tale with a little darkness...wrong.  It was actually a really great moive, theatrically speaking.  I also assumed it was a 'chick flick' but watched this as a date night movie and we both enjoyed it.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is a must see in this one!  Oh ... and I don't mind watching 'Thor' either :)!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Love this book.<br />great teen book includes great moral meaning. good for all teenagers teaches them a lesson. this is a must read couldnt put the book down
B000JMKQX0|1.0|I bought the book to read because I saw the movie trailer. It was a lousy read, there really is no story. I would not waste my time or money buying it. Just wait for the movie. It has to be better!
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|This was a Christmas request from a grandchild.  He was excited to have gotten it.  Loved to play with this using a target as he loves to deer hunt.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a wonderful book.  I couldn't put it down. It is an interesting way to look at Nazi Germany and the Holocaust.  Provocative characters and an ending that broke my heart.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is fun.  I liked it on iPad and I'm glad it's on kindle fire.  ADDICTIVE AND SUPER FUN.  It continuously gets better with each update.  I highly recommend it!
B004FOA84A|1.0|Couldn' t figure half of it out  Doesn't have easy directions to follow either.<br />Will stick with easier kids friendly games
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Love all things Downtown! Love love love it! What more can I say it has me hooked!!! Can't wait for the next week!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Wasn't sure at first if j was going to lie this game. but it really cool. so many games to chose from all rapped up in one. also you have to unlock many of the games. that makes you want to keep playing to see what the next game will be like.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|If you have ever played multiplayer FPS games on the iPod, iPhone, or iPad, I'm sure you've become frustrated with the on screen controls. They lack a physical response and it's really hard to judge how far your in game character is moving. The Duo Gamer solves this problem by introducing a physical gaming pad that most console players are widely comfortable with. This gives you a big advantage in online multiplayer matches and almost guarantees a high score. The only thing that I don't like about this controller is the fact that it's only compatible with certain games from Gameloft. Although, most of the better fps games are from Gameloft, so I don't see this as being a huge negative. Also, some reviewers have complained about the controller being heavy and uncomfortable, I did not find that to be the case. However, I do have large hands so that may be why. Overall, I would highly recommend this controller to someone looking to make their mobile gaming experience more enjoyable and fun. Well worth the purchase!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|Didn't love the book. Was a quick read but I didn't like any of the characters and wasn't shocked by the ending. Not a bad beach read but there are much better mystery/thriller books out there.
B009YP9L7U|3.0|It was a cute entertaining love story. It was fun to read and I enjoyed it. It's a good quick read.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|This is one of the movies which should be in Blue Ray format months earlier. I have the DVD format and it was jammed half way in the DVD player. It is specially filmed in black and white. It is another good movie from Steven besides Jaws. I can't wait to lay my hands on it.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Lots of fun!  A great way to pass a little time.  You'll find yourself getting excited about fulfilling the prize collections and snarling at an ill placed coin. Fun fun fun!
B006ZCWU5K|5.0|picked this up to learn the new music before going to see him for my first time. well worth it.
B001DHXT6G|3.0|The only thing i would say about this version is i was disapionted with the them reconstruction the music sounds great but they did not get the voise over from Bill Shatner right the music drowns it out i would have left the whole thing alone. Having grown up listening to it, that is somthing i really noticed.<br />That said the remaster of the films them selves is really good.<br />All in All a good buy at the price.
1419705849|5.0|My son loved it....Read it in 2 days... Truly kept him out of trouble too! lol Worth it!! All the way!!
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|While the voices of so many have contributed to Les Mis over the years, this latest CD will impress any dedicated Les Mis lover. See the movie as it is spectacular in terms of acting, scenery, and emotion.  This CD will leave us remembering this vividly engaging movie. Love the MP3 ease through the Amazon process
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I found myself struggling between wanting to finish as quickly as possible to find out how it ended and trying to make it last because I didn't want it to end. So thankful for the epilogue to know more about the ending than just the immediate ending. Will read it again one day soon to soak it all in again.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|And I'm glad I did! I'm hooked! The 2nd book is better than the first, and th third is better than that!
B004LSO6YI|5.0|A lot of lesbian movies are predictable or unrealistic.  I thought this one did a pretty good job of keeping is sweet.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I am looking forward to part two. It's 3:14 in the morning and it's time to go to sleep. This is a great game and I would tell everyone else to give it a try.<br />It's great fun.
B0084U0IEG|1.0|It seems to me there was a lot more of importance going on during the Cold War than merits Mr. McEwan's novel. I found no redeeming features worth mention.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I almost got all the people. I play this on my kindle fire hd like if u got one and love Amazon
B009ANAQ4S|5.0|As always, Van has produced another classic recording.  Usually Van is my Sunday afternoon listening choice while I am writing or cooking, usually accompanied by a glass of Guinness or Bass ale.<br /><br />Enjo, and sing along if you must!<br /><br />Mark
B000EULJLU|5.0|All I have to say is if you want to encounter some of the greatest music ever made tool is it.
B003B02O7I|5.0|One of those rare books that you don't want to end. Something for everyone. If you like adventure, it's there. Human weaknesses, it's there. Plus the usual legal intrigue written in a manner that everyone can understand. Have read many Grisham books and this is my favorite.
0684843749|5.0|The &#34;New Encyclopedia of Modern Bodybuilding&#34; by Arnold Schwarzenegger is the best bodybuilding book on the planet, period. Unless, of course, you PREFER being a little girl who's afraid to lift weights. Then this book isn't for you.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am still reading this book, but I am loving it. I am a big fan of Nelson DeMille and this book is just great
B003WUYRGI|5.0|Lobe me some nigtion this shut 've all dat an some chicken and chicken ed begin by as count hole
B005K17RU0|5.0|I haven't had any problems with this app on my Kindle Fire HD. I like the different views available for the day or the week ahead.
B001R60ESE|5.0|My husband and I have watched this over and over during the past few years. We never get tired of it. The variety of outstanding musicians who share the stage with Botti are phenomenal. We particularly like Smile, performed by Aerosmith's lead singer, Steven Tyler. Fantastic!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Not yet finished but it is OK.  I've read most of Nicholas Sparks books buy this is definitely not one of my favorites.
B005LAII08|5.0|This was a gift I got for my sister. We actually sat down to watch after I gave it to her. A very good animated movie. I like how they kept the authentic accents within the movie.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|I give this book a rating of 5 stars. Never expected it to be this good. Very fast paced. Hard to put down.
B000FCK42M|3.0|I found the first parts disconnected but the second half did get the story together.  I wonder if this is not more truth than fiction.  I'm glad I read the entire story.
B0013URJTG|5.0|Amazing Sound Quality, better than any other album I know of.  The Songwriting is also superb.  Not as heavy as other PT albums but the sound quality puts it on top of my list.
B0051UP5NQ|4.0|While the Fire should really come with this, this is a pretty good fill in for your normal Office package.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Excellent book that gives an exciting new incite to the world beyond in heaven. Would highly recommend to all, believers and especially non believers that love and heaven are real.
B004DM0UII|5.0|This app exposed me to musicians in my favorite genres of music that I would not have heard of on any other music app.  What distinguishes XiiaLive from all other music apps is the amount of independent artists they play on each station. All my other music apps only play popular artists which makes them redundant. The sound quality for the radio stations I listen to range from good to extremely high quality. I recommend this app for music lovers who are looking to break free from hearing the same songs provided on the other music apps.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Great 3D movie. it is the only 3d movie that I have and it lived up to my expectations for my home theater.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I just finished reading this book! It was one of those, skip dinner and do not go to bed because I wanted to know what happened! I LOVED this book, one of my new favorites. I loved the passion that filled the pages, I really could see this \\" beautiful disaster\\" playing out. It is rare to find a book that really lets you just get lost in the characters and feel the angst and emotions the way this book does. I can't wait for the second! I also hope the author continues to make more books like this! The writing was beautiful and flowed so quickly. Great Book! Buy it Read it!
B009XTF8JM|2.0|i was really looking forward to this movie since it came out ini the movies. and when it came out on bluray i ran to the store and bought it. half way in i was thinking to myself boy these people are really talking alot about nothing and nothing truly is happening, it wasnt scary and being boring. i was trying to keep myself up so i wouldnt fall asleep and maybe miss something good. but to my mistake nothing happen. i real let down to a movie that should of been soooo much better.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|absolutely loved season 1 and 2.... season 3 last few episodes aren't as good in my opinion!! can't wait to see what happens!
B009MF56GC|5.0|its deff an old school type of action flick. shot first and ask ?s later. think at times its better then part one, but at times part 1 was better then this. alot of action and alot of funny moments.i saw part 3 is coming out in 2014, so that should be a cool movie to. if you like action and humor and just a fun movie. id deff buy or rent this movie. my only problem i had was that the picture seemed really grainy. all my other movies look perfect and when i watched this and the new dredd movie. there was alot of grainyness in the picture.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Big fan of Preston and Childs and will always read their books. Characters and their struggles are great. Didn't give 5 stars because main plot theme with Pendergast has been done in many other books and was disappointing.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|this app was one of my favorites. the mini games were not so hard that you needed help.worth the money
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I loved this book. It definetly met my expections and the fact that it continues with the Percy Jackson & The Olympians story was fabulous. It was a bit different since it's being told in the 3rd person and by 3 different point of views, but at the same time it made the story more interesting because you get an inside look at everyone involved not just one person.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Bought this for a book club read. Different style of writing and presentation which I found a little hard to follow. Story was good.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven was an excellent read. This book brought tears and laughter throughout the entire book. I can't wait to see the movie!!
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great movie and was exactly as expected. Purchased for grandchildren, 4 and 6, and they loved it. Loved that I didn't have to track it down in a store.
B008K9UZY4|5.0|i liked the this game,is old scool but is very entertained,specially when we are out home i really reccomend this game
0307730697|5.0|I've read alot of books on SEALs and I've never read anything like this. From Adam's low point in life to his ultimite sacrifice he show's everyone the odds he had to face in and out of the military. I think no one has endured this much struggle to be the best of the best than Adam Brown.
1439130833|3.0|I thought it was the book I ordered though. But the daily teachings isn't worthless. It can be use like a calender!
0316067598|5.0|I've read numerous books on SEALS and their extrodinary experiences but to this point I've never read anything that is equal to Marcus Luttrell.<br />OK the first part (BUD/S) is the usual nitty gritty &#34; I feel like giving up&#34; attitude that every cadidate  has to deal with in training.<br />Marcus still delivers at this end though bringing &#34;blow by blow&#34; obstacles to the reader.<br />Once he brings us to &#34;boots on the ground&#34; though it's a different story. What he and him team had to endure is beyond reason.<br />I could not put this book down because of the life and death that was present at every turn of the page. I just have to say Marcus, his Team, SEALS, and all our military are true heroes. Not these sports people crying about contracts.
158270208X|5.0|It's more like a journal for me. It really has the look and feel of a book of magical secrets. Childish I know, if it should be altered at all it only should be adding additional pages.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|best game ever just needs more levels if you are reading this just download its free so you have nothing to lose in the first place
6304696558|5.0|I had received this DVD and kept it ready to watch about 1 week ago. Watched it and had dialogue captioning posted at the bottom of the screen - not what I had ordered! I did order another one hoping that this problem does not occur with the captioning at the bottom of the screen as well. The movie was such a treat to watch and will allow for better things to come when the 2nd DVD arrives! Received the 2nd DVD and turned the subtitles off per the menu choices on it as well - all it takes!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I have to admit it - zombies scare me a LOT!! But after cringing and holding my breath while being captivated with the first episode, I was HOOKED!!! Had to watch another, and another... Thank you AMC for making one of the best shows I have ever been able to watch!!! You just have to know how people can survive and they make you able to really feel for the characters and put yourself in their shoes. Cannot wait for the second half of the 3rd season to start!!!!
B006M4F67A|1.0|The game plays fine, but the background and tiles are all the same color, visually boring and hard to see the tiles.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I THINK THIS BOOK IS BETTER THAN THE 1ST ONE. FIFTY SHADES SEEMS TO BECOME A LITTLE MORE GENTLE IN THIS ONE.
B007XH6BPG|2.0|I carefully read the reviews here on amazon and bought Squackett expecting something more symphonic/progressive. Even the sample music clips emphasize the smattering of Genesis/Steve Hackett influence. Sadly, there is not enough of that on the actual CD to satisfy this proghead and I quickly put the CD up for resale. Steve Hackett's solo albums, with producer/bandmate Roger King are first rate. This is not a solo album, rather an uninspired project with Yes stalwart Chris Squire.  Those who buy Steve's solo albums should skip this one. For completists only.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|I don't think it's fair that people (not all) are rating this demo just cuz it's short. IT IS A DEMO! I understand that it could be longer, but if u like it, buy the full version! I love it!
B00AYB1RGG|2.0|This movie must have been produced secretly by a video game developer. It was very violent and there was a lot of focus on the visual effects (bullets hitting people, blood spattering, drug hallucination effects, etc..) . I loved the first dredd movie and this was a big disappointment to watch, it preserved absolutely nothing that you remember from the original, other than the helmets and the smart guns.. If you have an itch to watch a dredd movie, go watch the original, again.
B004LUS390|5.0|I LOVE this app! It's so easy (for me, at least) to use and is perfect for my constant on-the-go sketching needs. Now every time I go out and feel the urge to draw, I have this. This app IS worth it's dollar. If you love to draw constantly and everywhere, then this app is definitely for you.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Very happy with the cable. No working parts to break so as long as it works I am good with it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is awesome. And this is coming from a picky thirteen year old. This game is very entertaining, a time consumer (perfect for my long bus rides to school), and most of all, it's free! Not only that, it also has levels that are hard and take some thinking, which really gets my brain working in the mornings. Great game!
B005IQZB14|5.0|I really liked her honest writings. I almost felt like I was on the trail with her because she was very detailed. I recommend this book to people who enjoy books of journey. It was also fun that she added so much detail about the cities she visited and trail info. I am from Minnesota so being she has history there was a bonus.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This is a very fun and fantastic game good graphics good gameplay good everything and I think it might be the funnest game I've ever come scores
B000FBFN1U|5.0|First off, this is by far my favorite entry so far, as many agree. Chaos reigns in A Storm of Swords, as villains become heroes and heroes turn to villainy. Martin's ability to build an ever evolving world is second to none. You may think you know where the story is going, however he'll leave you reeling. Altogether another great chapter in a great series. Cannot wait to pick up the next book, so I'll end my half hearted attempt a review and be on my way.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I. Wakes my family up every morning no one is tired everyone's happy cause th he f2f doughnut in b yt? ujvgjnb
B007THA4FI|5.0|Rowling makes all the characters in this book instantly memorable.  She makes each character come alive on the page so that I felt that I really knew each one.  It was difficult to put this book down, and I probably will read it again.

B008QMMEOE|5.0|My two year old granddaughter absolutely loves the puzzles!  I am amazed at how quickly she understands what she needs to do and remembers it the next time she plays.  It is a great diversion when she is getting tired or bored.
B005LAIIA8|4.0|I was so curious to watch this movie with the combined powerful names of Disney and Tim Burton behind it!  I could not imagine the two put together and what they would come up with.  After watching, I'm actually a little surprised to see Disney's name on it.  It almost seems a hundred percent Tim Burton.  Disney is known for it's family oriented movies and the name conjurs images of happiness, whimsical music and bright cartoon characters.  Frankenweenie is anything but any of these things.<br /><br />Frankenweenie was reminiscent of The Nightmare Before Christmas that came out when I was in high school (yes I'm dating myself).  That is the only other Tim Burton film I've seen but his style is so unique that I would have known it was his in an instant. It was dark and creepy with music to match.  Black and white by Disney was also a huge surprise to me but not with relation to Tim Burton.<br /><br />My kids are 3 and 4 and my son Reed is a little bit scared of things that are dark and in this case, rightfully so.  Scary creatures running around in graveyards, rising from the dead, screaming and just in general all around scary.  I actually enjoyed the film.  It was so unique and masterfully made that it was fascinating to watch.  My children, however, needed to hold onto me tight and look away during the scary parts.  They didn't want to turn it off even when they were scared so it definitely still had it's Disney draw. If you have a child that's easily scared, I would say skip this movie for them and that it's probably more appropriate for older children.<br /><br />My kids did enjoy the overall plot and my animal lover Paige was very emotional about Sparky and his battle with life and death. Even though creepy and other worldly, the Victor and Sparky characters are just as love-able as any of Disney's other characters. There usually is a bad guy in Disney films but I think the Tim Burton factor added a new level of scary for young ones.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray is in 3D but unfortunately I don't have the capability to watch in 3D yet.  I can only imagine how spooktacular it would be in 3D.  Yikes!  I might even be a little scared to watch that one!  Lovers of amazing imagery and thrillers at their best will adore Frankenweenie!in 3D but unfortunately I don't have the capability to watch in 3D yet.  I can only imagine how spooktacular it would be in 3D.  Yikes!  I might even be a little scared to watch that one!  Lovers of amazing imagery and thrillers at their best will adore Frankenweenie!
B009LA1R34|5.0|I bought this for my daughter after seeing her sing a duet with Tony Benett on tv.  Her voice and her music were new for us, but we love it.  We'll definitely be listening to more!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Great writing<br />Characters<br />Plot.<br /><br />I never thought that I would enjoy a Steven King novel, but now I find myself taking a second look at all of his works. Ok, maybe not the horror but he has a few others that I will buy now.
B0000060NA|5.0|How many albums can ever stack up against &#34;Songs in the Key of Life?&#34;  It sounds as incredible today as it did when it first came out.
B008K9SG9K|3.0|I bought this CD due to the good reviews and the fact that I love Radioactive and It's Time. I was extremely disappointed when I listened to the album. The rest is cheesy pop. Just not my thing. It may be great if that is your preferred type of music. If you are more an alternative/Rock fan, I'd stay away from this one and save your $ for something better.
B0056BMK6K|5.0|After reading this book I am convinced I will be capable of selling my book on eBooks. Mr. Locke has humbly mentored me through the process by being exact in his guidance, detailed in his information and presents proof of the pudding with his track record. Leaves me with but one thought, DO IT.<br />THANK YOU JOHN.<br />Marjorie
B004LWZW9C|5.0|i buy so many no time to watch yet- but it came fast and secure<br />so will share it-  looks like fun movie
B008JGSM6G|3.0|It's fun, it's easy to learn, and young children can play it.<br /><br />Sure beats watching television. It can be addictive.
B00ADIT8U2|5.0|Not only was the game reasonably priced, I had fun playing it.  There was just enough challenge to keep me playing for a while
B009FZFONO|4.0|Missed this show when it was televised, I am now trying to catch up to get ready for the next season.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|At first the book was a bit slow but given into the next couple chapters it reels you in. I could not put it down. A very well written book.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|This book was great! It was filled with love, heartbreak, happiness, and tear jerking moments that make you want to keep turning the page. I commend Gayle Foreman for writing such a amazing book. It was great and while I was reading it I couldn't help but wonder what was going to happen next. It was just so great and the book was full of real situations that caused the reader to feel something. I would recommend this book to anyone how loves to read, and to someone who appreciates great quality writing.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Far better than the first, the storyline is more than sex in this one! James' true talent as a writer comes shining through. Wonderfully written and the story is amazing
B003JTHXOK|5.0|A very moving book filled with love that causes you to be thankful for what you have. I Loved it!!
B00AYDC5HY|5.0|A classic boy and his dog story with a classic Frankston parody, all wrapped up in Tim Burton unique artistic style!  Did I miss the color? I'm not sure?<br /><br />Only Tim Burton can make you love a very ugly pug dog and a goulash boy with terminal goiter eyes and with floppy hair, but you do!  An astounding demonstration of how far a boy will go, to have his lost love back: LOVE CONQUERS ALL!<br /><br />One of the few Disney Movies in the last 2 decades that didn’t put me to sleep….Bravo!<br /><br />The ending was sad, but in Burton’s cartoon land, all ends well, with a possible avenue for a part two sequel…I hope….  William<br /><br />Tim Burton’s cartoon craters are sometimes grotesque and at the time amazingly human, very easy to love! Even Tim Burton’s monsters are cute!<br /><br />Should sell with the kids of all ages.....
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Intrigued by the movie.<br />I knew the trilogy would be even better.<br />I would recommend this one to any and all who enjoy a good tale.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I really haven't found a book that I couldn't put down in a very long time, this story completely took control of my mind and my heart from the first chapter. I kept saying to myself that I need to find a stopping point but I couldn't. Even bathroom breaks had me wondering what was going to happen next. I couldn't stop thinking about Sky and Holder.<br />Two thumbs way up Mrs. Hoover.
0385344228|4.0|I read this book because Stephen King recommended it, among others, in an Entertainment Weekly article. I'm always looking for new authors, so I ordered it. It's a very good book and the ending was quite a surprise. I would also recommend it.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|I expected and got alot of action. But was pleasantly surprised by the moral of the story.  Watched this on my laptop so not sure if the extremely loud gunshot sounds are intentional or a technical issue.  Wish hollywood would stop doing that.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|I had to think very hard to remember what this movie was about.  It was totally forgettable for me as it relies to much on CG and action scenes and contains too little in the way of story and character development.  This has become the Hollywood formula these days since they have pegged their audience as dull headed action freaks.  Fight scenes were way too long.  I had to apologize to my wife for picking this movie when it was over.
B007G3H8Y0|5.0|I might be biased for this album since I was already a fan of Train's style of music.  I like the fun songs and the ballads.  Saw them in concert at Berkeley last year and enjoyed a great night of dancing to their live performance under the stars.
B003VS0CX8|4.0|First time I seen this movie was over 20 years ago. The blue-ray version is much better now. The extra features are nice too.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|The time keeper is a book that contains a lot of &#34;food for thought&#34;.  One memorable quote I remember is something like, It doesn't matter how much time you have; what matters is what you do with the time alloted to you.  Another, Before a way of measuring time was discovered, no one worried about how quickly or slowly time passed.  It gives the reader a lot to think about.
B00979CS50|4.0|Neil, I'm just happy that you are still making music. It all started for me with On The Beach. Thanks man.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|the product is fine, loaded to my kindle.  However, I actually got bored with the story and have not finished the series.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I LOVE this collection of songs. Very nostalgic. Just love Rod Stewarts voice. The songs are wonderful and put you in the Xmas mood. Kinda sad Xmas is over for this year.
B00000I8UE|4.0|Love her style!  I play Time After Time and Right Here, Right Now over-and-over again.  Will definitely check out her other CDs.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Easy read, , interesting story.  Would recommend to those who like that kind of story., held interest, was surprised,learned something
0525952616|4.0|[[ASIN:0525952616 Kill Decision]]<br /><br />Automated killer drones, government conspiracies, special ops, this thriller has it all. Author of the Daemon series and three stand-alone books, Daniel Suarez adds another bestseller to his repertoire.<br /><br />High profile scientists and computer programming experts are dropping like flies as each are in the crosshairs of someone in high places for the expertise they provide. Soldiers with a highly secretive special ops team are actively working to both protect those who've been targeted and find the source behind the attacks.<br /><br />Myrmecologist, Professor Linda McKinney is in the middle of Africa studying the social structure of ants; a relatively no-risk line of work, until in one instant her world is turned upside down and she's running for her life chased by unmanned drones looking to add her to the list of deceased scientists. Rescued by Odin--special ops team leader--and his mates, they traverse the globe one step ahead of the drones, putting together the pieces until the ultimate showdown of wills.<br /><br />Daniel Suarez has done his homework for this thriller. The devil is in the details and Suarez gives us a wake-up fact that unmanned drones are now being used by the U.S. and other governments...a scary thing. But he pulls it together with a well-rounded story and characters that are larger than life to create a fast-paced ride that conspiracy theorists and thriller enthusiasts digging in their heels enjoying the ride.<br /><br />I've given \\"Kill Decision\\" four stars for the simple reason that although I enjoyed the book I found the technical details a bit much for my taste. I do feel they were needed as background, but I felt the flow of the story was weighed down with so much jargon it was easy to be distracted enough to put the book down.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I was given this book by Suspense Magazine for an honest and unbiased review.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved this book.  The story line worked all the way to the end and I wished it didn't have to end.  It was slightly cheesy in parts but what romance type novel isn't?  Definitely worth reading.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book and I really enjoyed reading this book. I didn't want it to end. I hope 's Collins rights some new books that are as enjoyable as these were.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book.  Quick and easy read.  Full of fun and also keeps ya on your toes.  Could not put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!! It is so much fun and addicting. The best part of this game is that it is FREE. When I first got this game then I thought that it may be boring but it is one of the funest games that I ever played.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|LOVE this series, and not just for the girls, guys can sucked into just as much.  Definitely recommend this show!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Oh what can I say about this book... It was awesome! They're both really cute! Finished it in two days and I really loved it! definitely one of my favorites!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|A very good espionage read. I like DeMille, ever since Charm School. I would recommend it tomy firends who read espionage and mysteries.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Brought to you by OBS reviewer Heidi<br /><br />*Beware of Spoilers*<br /><br />Katie quickly had her eyes opened when her puppy love led her to marry abusive police detective, Kevin.  After years of violence at Kevin's hand, she has finally escaped.<br /><br />Complete with a new identity Katie arrives in the small town of Southport, North Carolina, where she quickly gets a job as a waitress at a local restaurant and rents out a rundown cabin on the outskirts of town.  She has to pinch pennies to survive and is always putting away money in case she has to run again as she knows Kevin will never stop looking for her.<br /><br />She can't afford a car so Katie has to walk everywhere.  Weekly trips to the nearest store, brings her into contact with the owner, a widowed father of two, Alex.  After awhile, she starts having feelings for Alex and the kids, but she tries to fight them, but with an extra push from her friendly neighbor, Jo, Katie decides to give love another chance.<br /><br />But when Kevin finally figures out where she is, will Katie's new life come crashing down?  Will Alex's love be enough to save her?<br /><br />Honestly the synopsis of this book did not speak to me and I really had no interest in reading it.  But I have read a few of Nicholas Sparks's novels and I know I always enjoy them.  Although he sometimes loses me in his endings, the books are still good.  So, I read this one and I'm glad that I did!  And, for the record the ending of this book was pretty good.  Safe Haven is different from anything else I've seen from him, but it's still a wonderfully spun story that only Nicholas could have written; it just oozes his touch from page to page.<br /><br />The book started out slow with Katie coming to Southport and it took us through her day to day experiences as she began rebuilding her life.  We knew she was running from something, but didn't learn what from (although you can guess) until she starts showing us in the form of flashbacks as herfeelings start to surface for Alex and she decides to come clean to him; bringing the memories flooding back.  I'm not a big fan of flashbacks as a rule, but they were done beautifully in this book and it's truly when the story starts getting good and also when Katie's character starts gaining depth.<br /><br />I liked Alex, but he wasn't as fleshed out as I would have liked to have seen.  He seemed one-dimensional and a bit too perfect.  He was ex-military, a store owner, and a devoted father who lost the love of his life tragically.  He is always understanding and knows the right things to say.  Overall, I found him unbelievable and that's before you add in his prematurely grayed hair.  But I still enjoyed his relationship with Katie especially when they were able to joke and flirt with one another; she even got in a few cracks about his hair!<br /><br />Jo was also another character that I wanted to see more depth to.  I understand why Sparks wanted her to be vague considering how this book ends, but with her seeming like such a big part of the story based on the synopsis, I was expecting more.  I think that if he had developed her further that it would have made the conclusion of the novel all that more powerful.<br /><br />Kevin is just the opposite though.  He may actually be the most developed character in the entire book.  But where you have Alex cast as Mr. Perfect, Kevin seems like evil incarnate.  He is an easy character to hate and we see him slowly lose his marbles while drinking himself stupid and spouting off Bible verses at all the `sinners' around him.  I guess he missed the one about throwing stones at glass houses.  And, Katie made it way too easy for him to find her, but I guess we wouldn't have had an exciting ending if she didn't  which I knew even as I was yelling at her!<br /><br />Not only was the ending great, but it was proof positive that Sparks is a master of evoking emotions from his readers.  It was a gripping and emotional ending toa gritty tale of second chances and a tear-jerker, as always with Sparks!<br /><br />During the last half of this book, I couldn't put it down!  It's easy to see why it will follow in the footsteps of some of Sparks's other novels to being turned into a movie, Safe Haven will be  appearing in theaters this February!<br /><br />This review and more at openbooksociety dot com
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good read. I enjoyed the read but did not care for the author's way of ending, or writing their way out. The book was a worthwhile read.
B006WPSQVC|5.0|Very good Christian based movie. A great movie to watch with the family and learn and grow together.  I recommend it highly.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not Grisham's best work. Way too long, and not gripping nor spellbinding. It was somewhat a challenge to finish the book. Grisham is a fine writer, and I have enjoyed many of his books, but this was, to me, the poorest that I have read of Mr. Grisham.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|The smaller picture card slot on my camera had an unfortunate break, of course while on vacation.  Thankfully my Olympus had an XD slot as well.<br /><br />The card came quickly, well packaged and works great, I should have bought one sooner as a back-up, I will buy another, just gave it 4 stars because of the price.
B00003CXA6|5.0|First time I watched this was back in 1996 in highschool history class.. loved it then as much as now. Jeff Daniels does a great job in it.. I always get to a certain point where I cry like a baby.. have tissue.. I love the civil war and they did a great job on this movie and also Gods and Generals..
B005HMHPGI|5.0|A friend recommended watching It's A Wonderful life in black and white on blu-ray. He was right, it is wonderful. The definition makes everything seem so alive, so crisp.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|My family loved brave! A great movie for the little kids middle kids and mom and dad too. We highly recommend!
B0089EHWQE|4.0|i thought this would be a quick, fluffy read, and it was, but it was much more engaging and thought-provoking than I anticipated.  I loved it and missed the characters once I finished the book.
B0011Z5IVE|5.0|There are few better complete albums than this. It is a must have for any rock music collection. Buy it, buy it, then buy it again.
B009MO5960|3.0|This might be the worst movie yet in the resident evil series. In all honesty I only bought it because I'm OCD. I buy just about every video game and comic book movie. The first resident evil movie was great I enjoyed it a lot and felt that it was going to be the start of a beautiful well done series. But like all good things they never last. Then the second movie came out. I was so excited to see it. then when I saw it I felt like I had been slapped in the face. It was horrible. I then waited for the 3rd on to come out on dvd before I bought it and it was eh. I liked it except for the super powers. I mean Weasker gets them in the games but hers were just simply stupid and the clones. then the 4th one I thought it was stupid with the clones but they died off and she lost her super powers and I was happy again. so over all the 4th one I enjoyed it wasnt the best movie ever but it was better than 2 and 3. Then I saw this....... the movies don't even make sense any more. weasker is alive again but this time he is good when the virus was taking him over and going to kill him. and he gives her back her super powers. idk. Just looking at all the movies together in a row. they dont make sense. they just seem to come up with random ideas and throw them in there. they don't flow.
B009GED3HS|3.0|Usually, episodes of HIMYM arrive the morning after the episode airs. This one seemed to come quite late in the afternoon, with no acknowledgement that it was being delayed. I ended up watching it on CBS.com (which has it available late Monday night) while waiting for Amazon...<br /><br />The episode was OK, but I was very disappointed that it took relatively long to be available.
B008N1V11U|2.0|This game I should have realized would be pretty lame but I got it anyway cause it was on sale regreated it right after
B008Y2VTIS|4.0|Lots of good twists and turns.  A slight correlation to the actual people in history. Addicting, entertaining, a little over the top violence- but no more than most popular shows today.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|its okay just a different type of angry birds. I would not pay money for it but since its free why not
B007M45PMU|5.0|Absolutely love it! This album is great from the beginning to the end. I generally lean more towards older rock and roll but this album has opened my eyes.  Next up, Mumford and Sons.
B0086700CM|3.0|eh its fun for a minute or two but one of those games that you just sit there and play cause you have nothing better to do
B000N3T0DW|2.0|It is too dirty to show in my classroom.  I was looking for a good movie in Spanish with a good plot that would be suitable to show to high school students. They are extremely hard to find.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|what a wonderful adventure in a book. I would highly reccomend this reading to anyone. Im not a reader and I couldnt put this one down
B00005ABTT|1.0|I'm not a techie and when I ordered this DVD I had no idea what \\"Region 2\\" meant. (I<br />thought maybe it was being shipped from out East or somewhere outside the Midwest.)<br />Now I know Region 2 means I'm having trouble getting it to work in our DVD player.  It's just not worth the struggle,  not for a James Bond flick or any other.  Now you<br />can  Never Say Never  You Haven't Been Warned.
B004SIIBGU|4.0|They have almost every thing any one would need at a good price and it's easy to use too. The prices are unbelievably low.
B007L3BMGA|1.0|It is a stupid book and poorly written.<br />I will definitely not buy any follow up Fifty Shades of whatever books.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like the way it reminds me to read the Bible, and even reads it to me.  This helps me to know just how to pronounce biblical names. I think that with the use of this APPS I will not only learn more about the Bible but also become more at ease with the writings.
B005LAIHPE|5.0|This movie met and srpassed all of the expectations I had. The acting was well done. The special effects were top notch and the movie was an amazing show of craftmanship on all levels.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was a little slow at the beginning, but it gets very interesting towards the middle of the book, I didn't like the ending though!
B00AE2IJIE|2.0|Kind of a depressing peace of work. Don't like it. Boring, lack of colors, just not a fan of this kind of animation. My kids don't get it.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|No dark secrets revealed here.  Just good build up, background and an enjoyable read.I have more respect for our special op teams and the job they do.
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|I thought this is gonna be something new, unique... but it's just a new bulls*** with a bunch of a special effects. No one will beat \\"Total Recall\\" 1990 with Arnold
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I'm hooked!  Love this work from start to finish.  Small wonder the album garnered a Grammy Nomination for 'Best Album'.
B003SI7OQ4|5.0|I'm not even sure who likes it more&#62;&#62; me or my kids. Awesome movie for the whole family. I saw it many times:)
B00092ZMDY|5.0|A wonderful Christmas present for my Australian husband....great listening and  great  music.  Recommend this Farewell tour to any Eagles fans....
B000QCS8TW|5.0|I read this after watching the show and it was so much better even than that. All the details of thoughts and battles that you don't get on the show. Not as difficult to read as Tolkien but really phenomenal.
0810995212|5.0|Great reproductions, covers his whole life, and the text complements the plates. A very good book for browsing when you have a few extra minutes... the only problem with a book this size is that the illustrations have to be downsized, but other than that, a great purchase.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|Its a cute enough, I am unconvinced its possible to get 3 stars on all levels (6 for example). I don't have any problems with it freezing or locking up my phone but it probably won't stay installed for too long. 48 total levels and got to level 12 in about as many minutes.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|Whoever decided it would be fun to make customers jump through hoops to get to the product is living in an alternate world. I dumped the outer casings and stored the discs safely by themselves. Of course the shows are all available on Netflix so this purchase is only for fanatics like me who have to have them in their possession.
B001K98MFA|5.0|Really fast shipper really great price (previosly the english edition had been offered at $399.00 so bonus there! Love the multi format and I am totally stoked about the whole series again!
B0001ARCFA|5.0|very good  Studio Headphones.For the price, I haven't heard anything that even comes close to these headphones.<br />good quality.I love it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Dear God, I feel the pain in every breath.<br />Sure, this isn't the sweet read like Slammed and Point of Retreat, but peeps she did warn you and I have to say that she didn't disappoint me at all!<br />I love the characters in this and yeah, yeah we all know I'm a sucker for the tortured souls, but this was different and I loved it. I loved it, breathed it and broke down with it. Colleen touched base with some heavy issues and did an amazing job with it. I'm totally impressed.<br />There's a reason this author is a best seller and much love bi-otch of mine. I love her to itty bitty pieces.
B009ZZDNT6|2.0|Not user friendly at all.  Couldn't set it to play music or songs already on the Kindle.  Uninstalled it right away.
0316228532|3.0|Well, I did it. I finished all 503 pages of J.K. Rowling's first adult  novel, The Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />If I rated books out of 5 stars, I'd give this one 3 stars. The first 100 pages were deadly dull and confusing with all the unrelated characters. As the characters came together, the plot moved along more quickly.<br /><br />People who've read the Harry Potter series might think Rowling didn't veer that far from her original series with this book. Some of the main characters are two teenage boys (one of whom is an orphan who was adopted) and two teenage girls. They're all unhappy with their lives and find ways to get back at their parents.<br /><br />But the main focus of the book was truly income and education inequality. One of the characters is a crass, poor teenage girl with a drug-addicted mom. The girl is made more lovable with her devotion to her toddler brother.<br /><br />The middle and upper class characters have these fake worries in their life, like who will win the open seat on the town council, while the poor characters struggle to survive. The teenagers are self-absorbed and cruel.<br /><br />Rowling's book did not become preachy, but perhaps it was her effort to avoid preachiness that caused it to be devoid of emotions. A good book should make the reader feel many things. This one didn't, even as tragedies unfolded at the end.<br /><br />Although the book didn't evoke emotions, it did make me think more about what the middle and upper classes owe the struggling lower class. Rowling lived a life on the British equivalent of welfare, so she understands the differences between surviving and thriving. Here, she makes a point of showing us that the poor live a very different lifestyle, one that most middle-class people judge and can't begin to imagine.<br /><br />If I saw a kid drowning, I would definitely save him. Shouldn't I reach out to those kids who I might not see drowning, but who are still struggling in a different kind of river?<br />[...]
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I really liked the game, it was challenging and exciting at the same time.  The story line was alright but I wish it had more levels to it.
B002SAS26E|5.0|My wife and I love games that play well for 2 players, and Jaipur has been quite fun for us. The price fluctuates a lot online, so if you want it, watch it for a while to get the best deal.
B0046W5E0Y|5.0|My grand daughter and I love this movie. when it's on she will not move until it's over. I love it because the lil girls name is Elizabeth and that's my grand daughters name.
B008HK3XU4|5.0|I love this cover.  It is easy for my daughters to use and stays closed well with the elastic strap.  Kindle Fire can be put in so you can plug the charger up easily.  Soft cover with a nice no-slip grip to it.
1449410243|1.0|Book was a big let down. Filled with very crude jokes that weren't even funny. All the comics were cheesy and poorly drawn and looked like they were submitted by kids. I don't write many negative reviews on amazon, but this don't waste your money on this book.
B002MCJZHS|5.0|This is a great album that is so catchy it should have its own medicine. Second album is good but this one is still my favorite
0007183305|4.0|The book has a wealth of info but I didn't realize it was so small.  Makes it a bit difficult to read but the info is great.
B009JZTOG8|5.0|Sure, it can be a little corny, but it is a fun show that will piss you off and make you happy at the same time. If you like epic or the (good) old Disney cartoons, you'll love it.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|My husband received this as his Christmas gift (#1 on his gift list).  He loves this collection and has been enjoying it!<br />The West Wing:  The Complete Series Collection
B001DXS4E2|5.0|Still a classic even colorized.  We simply loved seeing what the clothing looked like then, but we still enjoy the B&W version as well.  Highly recommend.  Enjoyed the commentary afterwards about the colorization process.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this game is soo fun i just got a griffin. they are so cool. i dont have alot of room left cause i have so many animals. what i dont like about it is that you have to pay for property. i dont think you should<br />have  to pay for property
B001NFNFIK|4.0|Saw this on a whim and expected a made-for-tv kind of movie but what I got was a great complicated sad southern gothic thriller. No CGI tricks, no political correctness, just a good old fashioned crime mystery with a very riveting main character. Tommy Lee Jones is at his finest, as he almost always is. The soundtrack is great, the cinematography is well done and the story is one you'll want to hear several times over cause it gets better and you notice more each time.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I have searched for an alarm clock app forever it seems, this app is the best!  It has all kinds of selections, you can even wake up to your favorite songs. My personal favorite is from ELO's \\"All over the world\\". Try it, guarantee you will love it! For the Kindle Fire H.D. 8.9 it is awesome. Thank you amazon.com!!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game rocks I all most play it every day and you can Join in with other people who have the same thing.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I love angry birds and this game hit the nail on the head. It takes angry birds to the next plane of existence.
B000002UZ6|5.0|A collection of some of her biggest hits.  Would recommend for anyone who likes Tina.  A best buy of this artist
B002TWWOHE|4.0|I liked this show.  It has a sense of humor and no unnecessary violence.  Fun!  I will probably watch all seasons.
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|Way better than the movie!  Looking forward to reading the books in this set by her. It keeps u entertained for hours.
0988262592|5.0|If you are too busy and cannot get \\"real\\" work done this is the book for you. It will seperate the real work from the seemly endless \\"urgent\\" work. Unlike most books it is based on the real world with competing priorities and too many business managers dictating tech work.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|The book was absolutely amazing! It had large quantities of philosophy and religion intertwining with each other. It's amazing that this magnificent sea adventure was true, but you can feel inside that it is true.<br /><br />I would highly recommend it to anyone, but you might want to be at least a young adult, due to some parts are 12+ rated. I think everyone should read this beautiful book.
B004SIP9RO|5.0|I have been looking for this movie forever.  I was happy to find it at Amozon for an awesome price.  It arrived in record time
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing! It described how I feel sometimes and it was also very easy to understand. Though it was a little awkward in some parts.
1476712042|5.0|I FREAKIN' LOVE THIS BOOK!!! I first heard this book from my girlfriends. For weeks they kept going on about a book so great, so romantic, so bad boyish. That I finally asked them, they told me &#34;once you start you won't let it go&#34; They didn't lie. I highly reccomend this book to any female!! And if you have a boyfriend you're going to want to have him read it. This book has everything!! It should be made into a movie. It has college, parties, sex, alcohol, underground fights, mafia, gambling. It's great. I'm looking forward to the next book coming out in April!! :D
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I loved all three books what a great story. And now the movies oh boy I can't wait. They did a fantastic job on the first I only hope the other two are as good.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the only bad part is that you have to unnlock each game . the games seam to get better the longer u play
B007HLIUN4|5.0|A social & economic review of the world over the last fivethousand years ,& the pitfalls which still apply today
B007ZXK08C|4.0|This book kept me in suspense throughout the whole book.  There were many twists and turns that had me thinking the outcome only to change my mind many times.  I couldnt put the book down and even at the end I was left wondering.
B00AUA67GQ|4.0|I purchased this item because I am self-employed and have need of notes with customers to be followed to complete a job for them. I have tried to remember things but usually forget! With this item I hope to keep the memory loss to a minimum! I have only used it quite briefly at this time but it seems to be what I was looking for to fill in the gap.
B0095R64AO|4.0|The actors in this movie really raised the caliber of the material I think. A good deal of the funny parts were in the trailers but not all was given away. At times it was difficult to measure the amount of time that had passed but that's ok. You know from the title how long everything SHOULD take. The middle where they were in Michigan and Jason was trying to find himself was a little long in the tooth and then the ending felt very rushed but overall, due to the actors, I found it to be an entertaining film.
B0094K1QR8|2.0|Beautiful people with unlimited energy and money.  The plot barely exists.  I suppose that as fluff it could be worse, but I would rather waste my time on fluff that's not quite so sugary.  The attempts to develop the characters, even the main ones, are slimy thin.  The premise is interesting enough, so I give a second star.  A little salt or grist would have made it more palatable.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Rock and Roll Never Forgets says it all for Bob Seger!  A sound all his own: none compares.  Love it.
B006FE83U4|5.0|This is a classic movie.  It is well worth getting it and exploring all the extras.  Picture quality is exceptionally good.
B007T2XC7A|5.0|Norah Jones has her own sweet sound and this is a wonderful grouping of her songs.  I loved it.  What more can I say.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|Fun to watch for the whole family.  My 4 year old loves it.  A classic movie about friendship, and loyalty.
B002DD67XG|5.0|James Taylor is James Taylor and there is none that compare.  This is a wonderful grouping of his songs.  I love it.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book  is so much better than expected! It is one of the best books I have ever read! I would definitely recommend it
B00138CYD4|5.0|Santana has his own sound, nothing quite compares.  This album is definately Santana sound. I love it.  What more can I say.
B000NY12LO|5.0|It was timely with the event in Connecticut having happened recently.  Jodi brings all sides to the table for review.
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Creedence Clearwater Revival has its own sound and this is a good collection of them all.  A great collection of them.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I'm not good at writing reviews so I don't do it often, but I really loved this book.  I didn't want to put it down and was sucked into the story completely
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|One thing is undeniable, Lee Child knows how to write an entertaining story! He captures the reader's interest right from the start, when Jack Reacher, who is the main character and first person narrator, starts by calmly describing how he was going to be arrested while having breakfast at a diner. We quickly find out that Jack is an expert in weapons, hand to hand fighting and anything that has to do with military / police procedures.<br /><br />Once the author grabbed our attention, he focuses on keeping the suspense level high, while at the same time having certain elements having to do with pure mystery. It is almost as if this a mixture of an action thriller and a whodunit. Some people may not be happy with this approach, but it worked really well for me. It kept me turning pages nonstop, and ultimately, it made me overlook some of the faults of the book when it came time for the final evaluation. And there are several faults with this book. For example, the catalyst to Jack's interest in the case after being wrongfully accused, has to do with a huge (and I am talking unbelievably HUGE) coincidence. At the time, it bothered me quite a bit, but the rest of what was going on was so interesting that I let it go.<br /><br />The writing is not stellar by any means, but it is still adequate enough that it does not prevent the enjoyment of the story. The section in which this is most noticeable is when it is time to go into technical details, since it gets a little boring quickly. Luckily, these section are few and far in between. Finally, the other negative point to the novel has to do with some inconsistencies when it has to do with Jack's deductive powers. In some cases, he is able to figure out the most complicated and twisted events by pure reasoning, only to be blind to really obvious clues in some other cases.<br /><br />Like I said, if I was going to be totally objective, maybe this book deserves 3 stars instead of 4, but since there is no real need for me to be objective, I am going with my overall enjoyment of this novel. I am definitely going to be trying other books in this series.be objective, I am going with my overall enjoyment of this novel. I am definitely going to be trying other books in this series.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game its different from the computer and xbox but not by a lot its only version 1.2.1 unless they have released a update for Kindle Fire idk about. Totally worth 6.99 and with future updates probably wroth a lot more. The things that I don't like about it is there's no armour and you cant connect to other users unless there pretty dam close to you so unless you have a sibling or neighbor with the app close to you. Have fun playing alone. (This comment will become obsalente or something anyday)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I tore through this book in three or four days. It is extremely well-written. The writing flows smoothly, which makes it easy to read, while at the same time bringing up loads of emotion and moral conflict. The moral ambiguity in this book makes it very thought provoking. I'm ready to read the next one in the series!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Classic sci-fi movie that introduces Robby the Robot to viewers.  Wonderful after 50 years and still going strong!  Even my daughter watches it.
B005ARYEY6|5.0|This was purchased as a gift and was well received and enjoyed. The package is well put together and the addition of a dvd makes it better
B00AAX68HG|5.0|I though it was going to be lame when my sister showed me but its super fun and well free!!! its sorta like cut the rope although no rope ur just connecting blobs! but trust me its fun and if its not return it haha jk but really ull love it C:
B003TTCURU|5.0|I was able to watch this episode right away, which was great because it was the season finale when I had no other way to do so.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book much better than the first. I am looking forward to reading the third book. This book was more about survival than who she loves.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|This is a great tool to have on your kindle. goes directly to the search. i dont have to open the web.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Second book better than the first.  The romance is awesome.  There should be cliff notes for our husbands on the intimate scenes.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This is just to addictive and it kills alot of time.  Only problem is that I have to start all over on my hd but thats a complaint for amazon.
B0076DELIG|5.0|The Black Box by Michael Connelly<br /><br />Harry is at it again, with a feud with his supervisor, who just don't cut it. A very good read.  Will keep you up to finish it.
030758836X|4.0|I'm not really a murder-mystery kind of girl, but this book was part of the curriculum in my Contemporary American Literature class.  I personally felt that the first half was pretty boring, which is why I only give the book 4 stars, but the last half was infinitely more interesting.  I lost sleep to finish this book.  Worth the read!
B005K01VZS|5.0|I love this beautiful story.  I recommend it for anyone who is, like me, on a spiritual journey.  It is one of many books I am reading on this subject but this one is true so it really grabbed my heart and soul.  The rabbi is a wonderful man and Mitch's own journey with him made me realize what faith brings to your life, beyond having a relationship with God.  I will read it again and again.  Thank you Mitch Album for sharing so many of your experiences with us!
0307719774|5.0|I love that this journal takes almost no time to keep up with every single day.  You can spend as much time as you want if you've got it, but with this journal there is no excuse to skip a day, even if you're swamped.  It's a great setup for people like me, who have a hard time following through with their journaling goals.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I will never forget 911 and I read this book because I wanted to understand what happened the day they killed Osama Bin Laden.  What you get with this book is Mark's journey to become a Seal which ultimately leads to his involvement in the events that led to this day.  He is modest and fairly gives credit to the others involved so we, the readers, get a broad understanding of everyone's role from the CIA to the helicopter pilots.  It is a remarkable story of courage and bravery.  I felt tremendous pride in the men and women who protect us whether they are sitting at a desk or fighting the enemy on the ground, in water or in the air.  I couldn't put it down.
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|I'm so  in love with this book it moved me. I could never live with out love. I could never be in a world without emotion. Can't wait for the second book.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|I read this book because a friend recommended it and I love several of Mitch Album's other books (Tuesdays with Morrie, Have a Little Faith, For One More Day).  This one was a little far fetched for me and just so different from Mitch's other books.  I did learn something about myself in that time plays such a major role in my life and I am the type that often wishes I had more time, but I got so much more from Mitch's other books.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This book would have gotten 6 stars but in all honesty it seemed to have a few too many plot holes in it. I'm a big fan of Child and Preston but I can't help but wonder it they didn't rush this one a little. Still, I did enjoy the book and would recommend it to all Pendergast fans.
B005HSL626|4.0|It's a really good game but whenever I try to open it it crashes.  I really did like the game though because I used to be able to play it.  Weird
B00993FEUK|4.0|While I thought the content of the video might be a little racy for some of my friends children, I enjoyed it. The animation is great and I liked the characters.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|this is better than Heroes of order &amp; chaos online. you should get this game.but you need to log in everyday.
B006MW3UZW|1.0|I have to say I didn't order this but will be going back and seeing if I was charged for this. I hear great things about it though.
B004J4WL50|5.0|Written really well and passionately and a very easy read. Will definitely make you want to start something that matters.
B0087YYHZU|5.0|My daughter who is a music-head and dance-feind was ecstatic to have this to watch when she returned home from school.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|As soon as it finished downloading I tried to play, but was surprised to find that as soon as I tried to select my character my kindle went back to its home screen! I tried it a couple more times but results were the same. I suggest not to download this game if you don't want your screen to freeze up!
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Ordered this for a nephew who is a die-hard Legofanatic. Was very enthusiastically well with the whole family over the holidays.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love it. this game challenges you enough to keep your attention and make you think, but not so much you get discouraged and stop playing. Great game!!!!!
B009LK6JS2|1.0|I couldn't ever get my plane to fly.  It would always crash.  I just couldn't get any of the controls to work.
B0053O89WY|5.0|I love this show. The Case was slightly damaged but the dvd works fine. Overall I'm pleased with the product
B0073LWEXK|3.0|Gets boring doing the same thing for a long period of time.  I just don't have the patience for &#34;enduring&#34; games.  The kids like it once in awhile though.
B000T433CO|4.0|It's a charming, sweet movie that's just perfect pre-holiday. It's my new holiday tradition. Jude Law is luscious, as is Cameron Diaz. Kate Winslet & Jack Black... Hmmm unusual pair but actually works! Yes it's corny, but fill a decent story with some really good actors, throw in a little romance & Christmas ... Voila!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|We've liked playing this game.  It is cheesy and fun.  There is enough of a challenge to keep us playing to unlock more features.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is a great novel for young adults and older. It is beautifully written, with deep, multifaceted characters. Chbosky has created a true work of art with this novel.<br /><br />But you should know that this novel contains a fair level of profanity, and it addresses adult subject matter (sexuality, drugs, rape, violence, abuse) as well as philosophical and religious ideas. Anyone easily offended by these topics should consider this before purchasing; some parents may want to read the book before giving it to their young children.<br /><br />However, as someone who has fairly conservative values and does not enjoy profanity or excessive sexuality, I fully enjoyed this book. While these elements were prominent (at least to someone who is sensitive to them), they did not overwhelm the plot or the meaning in the book. It spoke to a universal struggle--the struggle of growing up and finding a place in the world--that I think we can all relate to.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|My kids, ranging from 8 down to 2 yrs old, will play this game quite often.  I think it is a little redundant at times, but they always like caring for the different animals.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|This was a really great read. Wonderful start to the series can't wait to finish reading them all. It was a non stop read couldn't put it down when I started.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|My kids and I love playing this game.  It is challenging and fun.  The sounds are cute for the penguins.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Amazing tale.  Yann Martel is a fantastic yarn spinner and uses an unusual style to make his characters real.  Would love to see the movie next.
B008L1DNGI|5.0|I played this quite a bit on the dreamcast.  I think it is easier on a touch screen.  My 8-yr-old daughter loves it too.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a great little game that offers challenge and keeps track of your statistics. I like to play this while waiting for appointments. Enjoy!
B00884GR0W|4.0|I like it more than Minecraft.  The challenge is that night time on the phone is really dark, even when all the lights are out.  Some features aren't as understandable and clear as Minecraft, but the RPG-esque nature of the game is a different spin.
B004UNX1LS|4.0|This app is definetely helpful for me it let's me keep up with the music of yesterday,today and for years to come.
B0085YNML2|3.0|The kids like it and have fun until they get stuck on a hard level.  Doesn't keep me very entertained however.  A variant of the cut-the-rope theme.
B0050DZ8J0|4.0|I purchased this app to keep in touch with all of my Linkedin contacts, love being able to stay in touch while on the go.
B009MCRHH6|4.0|A little hard for young kids but they love building things with goo.  The graphics are really nice and it is fun to play.
B006WQLH7G|5.0|This app provides security for my both my Droid device and my tablet and you just can't get Free security.
B0012GMUOU|5.0|For me, there are just not many guitarists that can hold a candle to Jeff Beck. I have turned a few people on to this disc. It kicks hard.
B00AYB0SX4|4.0|Very entertaining and not terribly gory for a thriller/horror-type of movie. I love Jennifer Lawrence. I don't know if that's really her singing in the movie, but if she can sing too, wow.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|This book may be long, but it's well worth it.  I'm not usually into books about witches, but this is a different take.  I recommend this to anyone who likes paranormal fantasy.
1608862801|5.0|Daughter Loves it!!! Colorful and Informative.My daughter loves anything to do with adventure time and this worked perfectly as a Christmas present.Recommended!!
0765325950|5.0|I haven't finished reading the book yet but so far it has been amazing.  I'm really excited to see how well Sanderson has rendered Jordan's vision.
B00555X8OA|3.0|It seems like he takes a lot of liberties with some facts and makes assumptions that support his view. It's not as informative as I thought it would be. I'll keep plugging away at the chapters, maybe things will change as I get closer to the end of the book.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I really enjoyed this series when it aired. I wish it had continued, but I am enjoying being able to watch them again. Wonderful show. It should have been given more of a chance.
B004JZBGWI|4.0|I downloaded this note app to my Kindle to keep little notes about things handy.  I use it to jot down phone numbers or ideas that come to me when I'm using the Kindle.  (Keeps me from having to get up and find a pencil and paper!)
B005HSL626|5.0|I refuse to download games on my iPhone, I feel like a cell phone is NOT a toy, so needless to say in the 2 years I've owned a smart phone(which has just happened to be an iPhone the whole time) I've never downloaded any games, but when I got my kindle fire HD I thought, ehhh, it's okay, it kind of is &#34;for fun&#34; so games are acceptable, so finally I found the fruit ninja game, and at first I didn't download it b/c I thought the concept was stupid, but then I broke down and downloaded it to see what the hype was about and I'm addicted, I love this game.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I used to be obsessed with playing this game.  I played it all the time!  I finally had to quit - cold turkey!  I still play it occassionally when I want to do something different!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|As a facebook addict, this app is obviously awesome for those who want to stay connected to facebook. I'm glad it's offered for the kindle fire b/c I would be pretty disappointed if I had this sweet e-reader/tablet and couldn't get onto my facebook. I do wish there was a better(any) alert system like on your iPhone for when you get new alerts(comments, likes, messages). But I guess that's alright b/c being that my kindle doesn't ding when I get an alert my iPhone WILL so if I want to use my kindle I still can b/c my iPhone will alert me and then instead of using it to get on FB I just get on my kindle instead.
B00028HBKC|3.0|Bought this as a gift.  The person bought for enjoys this movie.  They requested this so I bought it for them.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book is really amazing and informative. Loved it from the moment I picked it up!! Mr. Gladwell did a great job with his research of coincidences, success and luck!
B00632HWOG|3.0|I used to use Yahoo Mail alot but Hackers have made it so you don't want to use it anymore!  I have the App on my Kindle for viewing my e-mail but have had to remove all contacts and files due to hackers sending erroneous e-mails from my yahoo accounts.  With no contacts, they can send anything anywhere!  I also just removed my Yahoo Mail account from my Smart Phone since e-mails were being marked as coming from Android!
B004GJDQT8|4.0|Minimalistic design with necessary features to find and do do what I need to without taking ages to load a page
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play this game quite a bit.  It doesn't take forever to play so I usually play while waiting in the Doctor's waiting rooms etc.
0316228532|1.0|I was extremely disappointed by J.K. Rowling's new novel.  Unlike her Harry Potter series, which had interesting and admirable characters, mystery, exciting plots, and an overall theme of good vs. evil, this book has NO good characters, NO interesting plot (or plot at all, actually), and is full of filthy language.<br /><br />It is regrettable that an author of Rowling's abilities would waste her talents and insult her audience in this way. Do only children deserve great literature and adults only trash?<br /><br />I would give it NO stars if that were an option.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Everyone needs Adobe Reader.  It comes on all the PCs now since everyone uses PDF files.  I use PDF extensively!  Needed this App so I can send PDF files to my Kindle for viewing.
B008KOTNVA|5.0|I love this driver kit. I have used it so many times and it comes with literally just about every bit you could possibly need, including those weird crazy ones you find with cell phones and mp3 players. It feels very durable and the case itself is nice to have everything organized. If you work with computers, electronics, glasses, or just like having every bit you should do yourself a favor and get this kit.
0425263916|5.0|by far one of the best unfinished series i've ever read. reading the book keeps you guessing whats gonna happen next, the book also keeps things in question so you have to read the next book to find out. it makes me sad when i'm in the last few chapters of the book because i don't want it to end. I'm not much of a reader but this is one series I have to finish and I want to re-read. I recommend this book to people who enjoy reading XXX erotic books in detail, this is your book. This book finally give a smidge more depth of gideon's past but the next book should finally reveal it all. can't wait for entwined with you.
0425252868|5.0|Book gives you a different view and makes you think about what would you do. It is very easy to make bad guys out of the other side. This book helps you see the other side and maybe rethink what you thought you knew. Isn't that what books are for

B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed every minute of it. Seemed well developed and did not rush over the details. Well worth the time and I will certainly finish the trilogy.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|I received this as a gift and absolutely love it. This is funny keeps me laughing..I would recommend this to my friends.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Not enough Steve Carell to make it a comedy. It was just another so-so romance with an unbelievable rekindled romance after so many years of neglect of each other.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I received this as a gift and absolutely love it. This is funny keeps me laughing..I would recommend this to my friends.
8866130915|3.0|This planner has a soft shell cover on it, different from the previous one I had that was harder. It is still nice, just not as great of quality as I had expected.
B004ZRV3AU|1.0|it is very difficult to use, I still have yet to cut a bottle with it. I have attempted several times, using the directions and trying a few ways of my own. I wouldn't recommend it.
B005BDZQKU|5.0|Perhaps the greatest musical is honored respectfully in a boxed set. And Amazon offered it at an irresistible price.  Enjoyed over and over.
B00000AOTZ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies, so obviously I had to purchased the CD. After all, part of the awesomeness of this movie is the music. Nowhere to run to, nowhere to hide...
B008HK3XU4|5.0|It makes using my Kindle Fire HD 7&#34; very convenient, both for storing and while in use.  I enjoy reading at lunch and this case stands my kindle up for ease in reading.  I highly recommend it!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|C'Mon really? First book was a bit extreme.  Pretty unbelievable but a decent escape from reality  .<br />Far fetched characters  .
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This game is creepy!<br /><br />It is pretty simple to learn but after not beating the game on normal I ended up reading how to play. Should have done that first.<br /><br />You start with a bacteria class pathogen and evolve it by gaining DNA points. The object is to infect everyone then watch them die off completely before a cure is developed. Then you unlock different pathogens and do it all over again. Each time facing different challenges. I would have liked some different dynamics to the game other than just evolving until it spreads and infects everyone but thats no reason to drop the rating. The game is updated regularly (for free) and already has some additional content, almost like a new game, to download (for a small price). I have that one too but have not played it yet.<br /><br />This game is really creepy! The first time I won I actually felt a sinking feeling in my stomach as I watched the last hundred people die. In my head I kept telling myself some humans survived that fell off the grid. The human race will survive. It will.. it will.. it will..<br /><br />The game is fun and highly addictive. Glad I bought it!
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Not like the original, glad to finally watch a remake of an oldie but good that didn't follow the original movie.
0385736002|2.0|This book contains loads of shallow erudition -- the author paying lip service to just about anything he thinks is neato.  I spent so much time rolling my eyes that I got a headache.  Still, if I had a clever adolescent reader in my family, I would give him or her a copy of this book, because it might inspire further explorations into history.
B008476HBM|5.0|I dont know what shall I say about it, I am in love with this book. I am sure everyone knows Mr. Darcy but you should read the book before you see the movie
B00007KGCW|5.0|Finding Nemo is great, but make sure you dont' do what I did and buy it for the wrong region. It won't play on any US DVD players, only ones in England. It says non US format for a reason! lol
B001EC3JME|5.0|Purchase by the need to protect and turn my flashlight, but without thinking I was getting a great product, I recommend it to people who really need it is worth ...
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|OMG, my son would play this 24/7 if I didn't take it away from him. He loves this game. It is fun just watching him play it because he has so much fun with it!
B00APUQPX6|5.0|My kids love the Ice Age serious and really enjoyed this movie. Even though it's a kids movie I also enjoyed it.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I just started breaking away from my usual horror or fantasy books. Everytime I went to the kindle store, this book popped up. So I finally gave in and bought it. This book was so good. The prespective is from the dog, which is just interesting itself. But the story had a such an emotional depth to it, and that was very unexpected. I laughed and cried while I read this book! I feel like this book reached my soul and made me look at life a little differently. That might sound sappy, but it really did. I highly reccomnend this book.
B00AYB1RGG|5.0|Good action movie, a bit dark with a lot of graphic death scenes. I wouldn't allow younger kids to watch this movie.
B009EEG8J0|4.0|My son loves this movie! I think it is so awesome that he can watch part of it on my kindle and then finish it on the playstation. That is truely amazing!
0525953728|5.0|Excellent book describing one of the most important missions to date in our fight against terrorism.  This book keeps you riveted from the first page to the last.  I would recommend this for anyone!!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This is okay. I don't use it that much because it is so different from the actual website itself. I think it's easier to just get on the computer.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|Drawing app.  Was having lots of fun with the family and then it stopped working.  I've tried to find a fix but have been unable to do so.  Miss the fun :-(
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This book is by far not the best in the Game of Thrones series, but it was still good. It did drag in parts, and I did struggle a bit to finish it, but I did. Oh John Snow, what ever will we do without you? And Cersei, you were so humiliated, but you totally deserved it. I do think that Cersei is just putting on a good girl face and will come back with vengeance in the next book (If it ever gets written). Get on it GRRM! I put too much time into this series to get left hanging!
0307960471|1.0|If you want to waste four or five hours of your life; reading PHANTOM is probably a good way to do it. It's never cool to say \\"I don't get it\\" for fear that those that are \\"HIP\\" will snicker. Well \\"snicker\\" away fellow readers of Nesbo because I didn't \\"get it.\\" I think Nesbo is screwing around with his readers. Proof is the end of the book.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I tore through all three books in about a day each. They're fast paced and gripping. Yes, there are some faults; some convenient things happen \\"off screen\\" that shortcut to the characters' next plot points; the romantic struggles get a little tiresome, but overall these are very entertaining stories that made for a fast, exciting read, and wove many important social issues into the story - just like sci-fi should.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|This item was purchased as a gift for a friend.  It arrived in excellent condition and on time.  I would recommend purchasing this two-disc special edition to anyone who is a Twilight fan.
B000J1AGQI|5.0|I purchased this DVD for my son.  He had read the book in High School &#34;We Were Soldiers Once and Young&#34; and wanted to compare the two.<br />.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I couldn't stop reading this. I tried and failed  ....I had to keep reading. 3:30 in the morning rolled around and I forced myself to stop....only because  my alarm was only 3 hours away from tearing me out of this wonderful world of love, lust,twists and turns. This book  comes highly recommended from me. I've already told all of my fellow ereaders that they have to get this book!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Les Miserables in my opinion is Victor Hugo at his finest writing. This tale will keep going from generation to generation; my kids have read and I hope my grankids will too.
B00A9X9TIW|1.0|Terrible story line lacking any of the sci-fi elements that the premise of the movie rides on: time travel.  Slow-moving at times and fairly depressing throughout.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|my wife loves the show and we end up watching 2 - 3 episodes/night! started season 1 last week and we are already caught up with season 3
B008673ZAQ|5.0|love, love, love it. very interesting book, great characters and story line. makes other books of its kind seem bland
B0091REZMW|5.0|I loving it...please come help me :) you will love the game also especially if you like looking for hidden objects like I do!!
0345529057|4.0|I don't know if the R.R. in his name is real or a marketing gimmick, but he is no Tolkien (as many reviewers keep trying to declare him); more like Robert Jordan with his \\"Wheel of Time\\" series. The difference is that unlike Tolkien, Martin and Jordan never seemed to learn what Shakespeare penned... that \\"Brevity is the soul of wit\\".  I quit Jordan at Book 9 and I'm starting to get the feeling that Martin is pulling the same stunt.  I started getting that \\"Jordan\\" feeling in the middle of \\"A Storm of Swords\\" (Book 3), and about 1/3 of the way into Book 4, it was confirmed, that this isn't going to end for some time.  Tolkien at least ended his series, and didn't jump back and forth and back and forth, adding new characters, and having people running in endless circles for whatever reasons.<br /><br />While his characters are very well developed, and the story is very well written, he's beginning to lose me. I want to escape when I read fantasy, not drag the real world in with me. I get more of a 16th or 17th century type feel for this world, where Tolkien's is far older. Where I would walk through the door to go to Middle-Earth forever and never come back, I have no desire to go to Westeros, or any other of the lands in Martin's world.<br /><br />Yes, it is more realistic, plausible, and gritty, than most fantasy out there, but I DON'T WANT to keep feeling like I need a bath after reading.<br /><br />Many fantasy/SciFi authors lose me with cartoonish stories, bordering on children's literature. Some lose me on over-complicated plots.  Some lose me by drawing things out and making them tedious. My rating may change, we'll see.
B008PWUT9M|4.0|I bought two of these for my daughters as a Christmas gift... :) They both love them and so did mom...
B0012GMY64|5.0|The songs were all that I wanted to hear from Andy Williams didn't want to miss out on hearing his voice even though he has died.
B00003CWN3|5.0|It was truly an amazing movie, very sad but it was well directed and the actors were so much like the real life people.
B004YM6JLO|5.0|This was a gift for my sister. It came in perfect condition and on time. She loved it. A really great season of this show.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I really like this game it keeps me very entertained... the only downfall us upgrade to buildings cost too much
B004EQAVHI|5.0|This movie came in on time and in great condition! It was a Christmas gift for my sister and she loved it. It's a great movie!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love horses, and I love the fact that I can take care of my own virtual horse !! You should buy this app if you like horses!!!
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|I enjoyed this read! I enjoyed the actionable exercises at the end of chapters and the new A.B.C definition of modern selling.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A book that touched my heart, and an amazing unexpected ending. It sort of cheated me out of emotions sometimes, bua end ..... UGH! AMAZING, had me in exuberant tears.
B004LWZW6U|5.0|I bought this for my husband and son. They loved it. It was cheesy and goofy, just what I expected.
B007L3BMGA|4.0|À very stemy book. Makes you imagine being in Ana Steeles place. Looking foward to the other two books from the serie.
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I cannot wait for second season to come out. Getting it on instant video is also much cheaper then getting the actual dvd set! I simply cant wait!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy playing card games, They keep me busy and not bored. It gives me something to do. Its a lot of fun!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Amazing game. Fun to play<br />But it ended too soon. I wish it was longer though. Stopped right at the good part
B0063GORYU|5.0|It makes you think and keeps your mind going. It keeps you on the ball and exercizes your brain. Its a lot of fun!
0345495004|4.0|I am thoroughly enjoying &#34;Loving Frank&#34;. A friend recommended the used book section.  I would certainly use this again.  I will suggest it to friends.  We have lots of readers in our RV resort.
B0012QRPU4|5.0|What a TV show this is.  Excellent cast and incredible story.  I rarely watch regular TV- it's often so silly, but this show is great.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|One always wonders about the parents of a child accused of murder.  Landay does an excellent job of presenting the parental point of view.
B004LWZW7Y|3.0|I am a pretty big fan of the \\"Shrek\\" series, minus (I believe) the second in the series.  Why is it that the first sequel to a series is always as ugly as an Ogre in the mud?  But then, when there is a third in a series, it usually cleans itself up and redeems itself?  The \\"Shrek\\" and \\"Men in Black\\" series are good examples of this.<br /><br />But \\"Puss in Boots\\" (PIB) is a spinoff of \\"Shrek\\" I believe, and when PIB first released, I saw that quite a few critics seemed to believe that PIB was better than Shrek.  So, since I really liked Shrek, I was pretty psyched to watch this film.  Suffice it to say that I was more than mildly disappointed with PIB.<br /><br />While the Shrek series was very clever in the way that it mixed modern day pop culture with older fairly tale creatures, this movie seems to just throw some characters in, well, just to throw them in.  The humor here just didn't seem to always land on its feet -- to risk using a bad cat metaphor -- but rather fell flat on its back.  And worse, there are just WAY too many double crosses here between the main characters.  At one point I thought to myself, \\"OK, Puss.  I can buy the fact that you gave Humpty Dumpty another chance, but a third, maybe even a fourth?\\"  I just didn't buy it and it was aggravating to me.<br /><br />I would say that if you're an adult, this film would be an unfortunate pass.  If you're a kid, say under 13 years old?  Maybe they'll find it amusing.
B004SJ3AXI|2.0|This was a pretty unimpressive game.  There does not appear to be any skill involved.  It's more frustrating than fun.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|A true challenge!  Lots of fun. More difficult than other angry bird games. Love the music. Worth the price!  Enjoy!
B005DI65L2|4.0|The book has a different perspective.  Dog ownership carries responsibilities and it is amusing to contemplate what a dog might be thinking.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This series is amazing and I for one cannot wait for the third book. I an invested in all the characters in the book and feel sad when I finish as I am missing old friends!<br /><br />A must read.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|Cute story that does not radicalize eastern cultures.  It was both laughable and endearing and suitable for all age groups.
B0090XLDKY|5.0|This is one of our kids top favorite DVDs of all time.  They love dancing and singing to the music.  They have also memorized most of the comedic interludes.  It is very funny to see our five year old make up her own dances to &#34;Make 'em laugh.&#34;<br /><br />Everything arrived intact and on time. Thanks.
B000Y5JFNY|5.0|The supporting material was interesting and informative.  The extra care taken to make allowances for the young child actors were extraordinary.
B0084U0IEG|5.0|The plot unravels at the end and is \\"anticlimactic\\" in the real sense of a love affair. It is like a relationship which ends not in passion and genuine sadness, but dissipates in a web of artificial intrigue and gamesmanship.<br /><br />The voice captures the perspective of a young woman in M15........but does it really? An admirable attempt.<br /><br />Ultimately too clever.... but the cleverness charms and seduces, but does not satisfy.  The final chapter is engaging, but by that time, there are enough hints to make it completely expected.<br /><br />A great read. Loved it.
B000Q9ISSQ|5.0|Bryson is a hoot!  Read this in Australia while I was experiencing what he was writing about.  Now I want to go back based on Bryson's descriptions.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I either love Stephen King's books or hate them; 11/22/63 is the former. Time travel meets nostalgia meets his version of string theory. Why King is so popular with the general reader is that he takes a normal setting and tweaks it, then tweaks again, until it becomes supernatural. Who hasn't noticed patterns repeating in one's life? These are King's &#34;strings&#34; of reality, and once you read 11/22/63, you'll view your own life with a new kind of awe.<br /><br />Brilliant man bringing it to the masses!
0307472590|5.0|Spectacular, intreiguing, you never know what is going to happen, you get cought from page 1. I can't wait for the next book from Carlos Ruiz Zafon....
B0017SWPXY|5.0|It is a very touching story with lovable characters. I recommend this book to anyone and everyone! Pet lover or not you will love this book!
B004H1U2HE|5.0|Reading this book is a wonderful journey. There are so many layers in which to enjoy: the tale of a precocious only child observing all around him; the reflections of the mature writer observing the past; the story of immigrant families adjusting to the new land; the story of the forming of the state of Israel and the accompanying wars; the many people living in this land. If you're looking for an action packed story to breeze through, this is not it. It's a series of connected vignettes and interesting characters that are to be savored one by one. This is a dense book, full of beautiful language.
006029129X|5.0|Simplistic adventures!  What one can do with a purple crayon!  Sometimes it is just<br />so nice to have books like this, simply written and simply illustrated and we are still<br />so caught up in the story!!!
0765325950|2.0|I ordered this final book and received it within two days of my order, so I am impressed with that.<br /><br />As for the book itself, I am extremely EXTREMELY disappointed in the ending. There is absolutely NO CLOSURE to the story! I expected some deaths, yes, but certain characters who died ended up dying so dishonorably. It just seemed messy to me. Another reviewer said that Robert Jordan left &#34;a complete mess&#34; for Brandon Sanderson to finish. I don't know that I agree with that, but I will say that the ending BECAME a complete mess. So many characters and so much happening at the same time. TOO MUCH going on at the same time, too many battles. There was no eloquence to the battle between Rand and Shai'tan. I'm just so disappointed by this ending. And what about the future of the characters who survived?? What about Aviendha and Min and Elayne and the BABIES for crying out loud! What about Rand?? Come on! I would've given this only ONE star, but I don't HATE the book. I'm not happy with it at all, I feel very let down and somewhat depressed about the ending, but I don't hate it. I've waited for so long, like all the other TWOT fans, for the conclusion to this awesome epic. But now, like others, I feel as if there is so much left undone and unsaid. This is seriously a disappointment. Thank you, Mr. Sanderson, for at least completing the series. But I have to say, it's not a very good ending. It could have been better.
B0002I831S|5.0|Debated on the newer &#34;improved&#34; release, but the uniqueness and improvisation of the original tapings are best experienced in their original form.  This has some unique features that can be activated to give more background information of the show as it runs, which I really enjoy!!  Bought all three for my husband for Christmas so I'll follow up on 2 and 3 as we view them.  We like that it stops between shows so we can read about the next one and run for break between.  If you love the show, these Original broadcast copies are a MUST!
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Bought for 14 year old and the entire family loves playing. definatelay a challenge th is both enjoyable and frustrating.
B0098VXE50|3.0|Dark, sometimes too long on the fight scenes, some pretty good graphics.  Little people  probably the best part with the best lines.
0385344333|5.0|The more I read Lee Child's books, the more I want to meet Jack Reacher. This book gave me another dose of my Reacher &#34;drug&#34; :)
1612680011|5.0|These ideas and systems should be taught to all kids starting at an early age, but we are never to old to learn something new.
0399157565|5.0|I have read all of her books and this one rates in the top three. Intense, interesting, intriguing and best of all, not written for a fifth-grader's level of understanding.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|I don't buy or download a lot of music so when I buy one it's a big deal. This artist was highly recommended and my firend was right! The music is excellent. The cd came right away in the mail, appropriately packaged.
141659521X|3.0|The book as a whole is wonderful and very entertaining, but I miss Mitch - he is just not there enough for me...
B005LAJ16I|5.0|I bought this as a gift and the person had never even seen the show, but ended up loving it.
1439102430|5.0|The real Dr. Brennan is back:) I like to watch the TV show but I do not think of it as part of the book series. This book has enough of the action and enough of the confusion of a complicated love life to make it realistic. Love it!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Awesome series!!! Would definitely recommend it to anyone wanting a quality and entertaining show.  Holds your interest and makes you apnxious for the next episode.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|These lights work great!  So far they only turn on at night when they sense motion.  We'll see how long the batteries last.<br /><br />**** My first review was back in January 2013, and today is Dec 27, 2013.  Twelve months later and the batteries are just now starting to lose luminosity.  I'm very impressed given the fact that we have three dogs that keep setting the sensor off.  I'll be buying a few more for the rest of the house.
B0001FGBD4|5.0|The music on this CD is simply beautiful.  It is an outstanding recording of outstanding artist.  Even if you don't like jazz you will love the music.  It will illustrate the weakness and the strengths in your Audio system.  This CD will turn you into an audiophile.  If you are a true audiophile you already have this CD an every time you upgrade your system this is the CD you want to play first.  You will not be disappointed by this CD, you may be disappointed by your music system.
B003VANOFY|4.0|The headphones are very comfortable and work awesome. The wireless range on these is really quite good too despite the presence of our Wireless Home Network which includes two routers (main and the extender/repeater/bridge) -- 5 cordless phones throughout the house -- two microwave ovens -- and a tightly grouped neighborhood filled with wireless home networks.<br /><br />The one and only down-side to this wireless headset -- in my estimation -- is the Bass response. It is pretty awful. It gets very distorted even when the volume is only slightly elevated above the average 'normal' listening levels. Otherwise, I'd give these 5-stars.
B006TJXZ30|3.0|I have a lot of folder on my hotmail account that I cannot access with this app. It only lets you get to your inbox.
0393089134|5.0|No complaining here. The book was beautiful, it looked like it was hot off the press when I got it. Not to mention that it made my girlfriend's Christmas.
B009MO5960|1.0|Resident Evil:  Retribution is the fifth installment of the Resident Evil franchise, which comes only weeks after the summer blockbuster season concludes, meaning maybe the studio didn't have complete faith in it?  Regardless, the plot is similar to the last four films, but it will never - no matter how many of the original characters return - be as good as the first or even second film.<br /><br />As usual, Milla Jovovich returns as Alice to take on the dreaded Umbrella Corporation, who has finally caught Alice, only to lose her - and then team up with her against the Red Queen.  Confused?  Well, let's wait until the next film for some more clarity on who's good, who's bad, and how much of the world isn't completely destroyed.  Michelle Rodriguez co-stars in dual roles (both of whom are clones - naturally), along with new-comer Aryana Engineer as Alice's daughter.<br /><br />In the end, there's very little need for a review of the plot/graphics/plot because it's the same as the previous films.  If you've seen the first four films and enjoyed them, then you will most likely enjoy this new film.  It's action-packed with lots of bullets and explosions.  There are zombies/monsters at every turn to provide the scare factor - and the 3D is pretty decent (even though it's a money racket, too).<br /><br />This film this is simply more of the same.  Each new film in this franchise is essentially the same plot recycled over and over, simply delaying the announcement of a final installment to bring the franchise to an end.  However, as with other franchises, if the money keeps coming, the movies will keep being made.  With that being said - anticipate a few more films in the future.<br /><br />Friday Night Date Night Review<br />Follow us at: Facebook.com/FNDNReview
B001TIQT98|5.0|I agree with the positive reviews for this set, but would recommend buyers consider Bernstein Symphony Edition.  It contains all of these same Mahler symphonies, plus an additional 50 discs for under  $100.[[ASIN:B003Z9Q4WG Leonard Bernstein: The Symphony Edition]] A fabulous deal
B009AMANBA|5.0|Since the day a tyrant's bullet took him from our nation, Abraham Lincoln has been immortalized by a wide variety of mediums - ranging from one very impressive marble statue to countless impersonations, not to mention several films and television portrayals.  Because of the Lincoln myths, he is one of our America's most recognizable faces and is arguably the most important president in the history of the United States.  More books have been written about Abraham Lincoln than anyone other president, and still to this day authors and historians continue to make discoveries about The Great Emancipator.<br /><br />Discoveries aside, it's also fun to emulate visions of Lincoln as more than just a man - but also a superhero. In Abraham Lincoln: Vampire Hunter, he is portrayed as the man that freed the slaves, as well as the man that helped defeat the vampires. However, on a more serious note, another recent film - The Conspirator tells the post assassination story of Mary Surratt, the first woman in American history to die by a hangman's noose just for being in the same house as John Wilkes Booth as he planned Lincoln's demise. So you see, it's not just Lincoln that's famous - it's anyone that's ever had anything to do with him.  And, now that Steven Spielberg and Daniel Day-Lewis have decided to show us their take on Mr. Lincoln, they will most likely go down in history as the two men that gave us the best interpretation of the 16th president to date - in the 2012 film, Lincoln.<br /><br />Steven Spielberg directs Lincoln, based on Doris Kearns Goodwin's book, Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln, which gives a condensed version of the months leading up the vote on the 13th Amendment - a vote to abolish slavery.  Abraham Lincoln (Daniel Day-Lewis) is only a few months into his second term as the Civil War winds to a close, but the issue of slavery is still front and center.  President Lincoln pushes his cabinet to find the votes in the House of Representatives to add an amendment to the constitution, putting an end to slavery once and for all.  Back door dealings, personal loss, and family turmoil are the backdrops as Lincoln struggles with some of the most stressful months in American history.<br /><br />Already earning him several prestigious awards, including a Golden Globe for Best Actor in a drama for his portrayal in Lincoln, Daniel Day-Lewis will most likely also earn himself another Academy Award for Best Actor.  After years of studying Abraham Lincoln, Spielberg went to great lengths to make this film one of the most realistic portrayal of Lincoln to date, including creating some of the most elaborate settings that cinema has ever seen.  This film is meant to show an aged, run-down Lincoln during one of the most tumultuous periods in United States history.  And, who better to an actor than Daniel Day-Lewis for the role of Lincoln?  From his real-life high pitched voice, Day-Lewis does a spectacular job of showing Lincoln as a conflicted, yet melancholy man who refuses to give in to failure.  The future of the union rested on one man's shoulders - a future destined to end in greatness, and tragedy.<br /><br />Top to bottom, Lincoln's cast is an absolute marvel.  Sally Field gives an Oscar-worthy portrayal of Mary Todd Lincoln, an overly depressed, angry woman dealing with her own inner demons.  After the loss of a child, Willy (not seen in the film) and her unwillingness to lose her oldest to the war, we are given our first real cinematic glimpse at the tragic downfall of Mary-Todd Lincoln, prior to the death of her husband.  Also starring in the film is Tommy Lee Jones as Thaddeus Stevens, an elder, radical Republican dead-set on abolishing slavery.  The role of Stevens has also garnered Jones a great deal of acclaim.  Jones' ability to steal a scene is masterful and it's quite possible he's Oscar-bound in the supporting actor category.  Joseph Gordon-Levitt (Robert Todd Lincoln), David Strathairn (William Seward), Hal Holbrook (Francis Preston Blair) and James Spader (Rep. William Biblo) also shine in their respective roles.<br /><br />As previously review when the film was initially released, it seemed the only downside about this film was the length of the film.  Running at an estimated 2 hours and 30 minutes, it can feel a whole lot longer than it is for anyone that doesn't have a heavy interest in Lincoln or history.  While this is a biographical film, it is not a film about Lincoln's entire life - and mainly focuses on the passage of the 13th Amendment.  The span of this film is only over a few months and certain scenes can feel like they drag more than others, however, the emotional payoff is well worth the wait.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a film for everyone - but it should at least been seen by everyone.  It is a superb work of art by Steven Spielberg and all of the actors involved.  Still, it doesn't qualify well for date night.  Yes, there will always be more entertaining films out there with more action, laughs, and crash scenes.  At the end of the day, Lincoln is about one man's dream for the direction of the United States.  It's about a man that suffers all his life through depression, but fought through it to reunite a nation.  This is a far more emotionally-charged and meaningful film that any other film in theaters.  Lincoln comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED for Spielberg fans, history buffs, and Lincoln enthusiasts - and should be seen by everyone at least once, especially the young person sitting in classrooms right now.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  A+<br />FNDNreview.comam Seward), Hal Holbrook (Francis Preston Blair) and James Spader (Rep.

B00A757EFW|5.0|Well lighted game, fast and fun, reminds me of the old games, looking forward to ordering more games, a lot to choose from
B009POCG5Y|2.0|Trouble with the Curve stars Eastwood as Gus Lobel, an aging Atlanta Braves baseball scout that is sent to North Carolina to scout a first round prospect and possible future star of the organization.  The problem is Gus is losing his eye sight and can no longer visually see the game.  His friend and co-worker, Pete (John Goodman), asks Gus' daughter Mickey (Amy Adams), an ambitious lawyer trying to make partner, to accompany him on the trip.  Gus also reconnects with a failed prospect turned scout, Johnny (Justin Timberlake).<br /><br />As far as the acting goes for this off-field drama, there's really no need to critique anything that Dirty Harry does on film, quite simply because he's earned the right to do whatever he wants.  If he wants to play a cranky old baseball scout that's losing his sight, he should indulge himself.  Amy Adams is easily the most enjoyable character to watch and masters the part to the best of her ability, but unfortunately she is thrust into a love story with Justin Timberlake, which feels out of place and unnecessary for this film.  That's not to say Timberlake is bad in the role (since he has surprisingly turned out to be a decent actor), but there are already too many other variables to deal with without a forced/rushed love story complicating an already slow-moving story - namely stress father/daughter relationship.<br /><br />If you're a fan of sports films, it's highly doubtful that this will even come close to breaking your top twenty.  It is certainly no Moneyball, or even a Field of Dreams caliber experience.  It's more of a Sandlot type film that only uses baseball as a backdrop to further its predictable, lackluster plot.  Could this have been a football or basketball film?  Very easily.  The studio should be advised and encouraged to change the name of the film from Trouble with the Curve to Trouble with the Plot.  Just saying.<br /><br />Overall, anyone that loves Clint Eastwood will want to check out this film.  He is still a master of his craft and it will be a sad day when he decides to call it quits on his long-lived acting career.  Let's hope he stays in the directors chair, though.  In any event, this film could have also been so much more to look at visually.  Instead, audiences are forced to look at a high school baseball stadium backdrop for the majority of the film, giving it the 'cheat seats' quality feeling.  For a film that had such high potential, it felt too busy and drawn out - not to mention sappy and bland.  Aside from the acting, it really did provide a high amount of disappointment.<br /><br />Friday Night Date Night Review<br />Follow us at: Facebook.com/FNDNReviewa master of his craft and it will be a sad day when he decides to call it quits on his long-lived acting career.

B007EC27QM|1.0|This thing is a piecie of crap. Who the hell wants one of those kindergarten calculators. This app ducks, don't buy it!
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|Santa brought our 4 year old son (and dinosaur lover) this movie for Christmas.  It's just as awesome as I remember it!  Thank you Amazon for your speedy delivery!
B00417HV14|5.0|Best concert I have ever seen on DVD love the double drummers I have recommened it to several of my music friends.
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|If you'd like to read a book about a girl who falls in love with the wrong guy, this is for you. They have a twisted, unhealthy relationship, and personally I think both characters could use some major therapy. While entertaining in several parts, I found this book to be rather dull. I will not be reading the sequel.
B0074JOCIG|5.0|Great concert DVD how can this guy get any better so much talent. Love to watch it while I work out at home.
B005FQ2H8W|4.0|Of the very few good time travel movies out there, this is one of my favorites. The story is good and Michael Pare is perfect in the role. The Philadelphia Experiment is both entertaining and enjoyable, kind of a blend of time travel and sci-fi. Whether or not one believes in the supposedly true story the movie is roughly based on in no way affects the enjoyment of the movie, it's a lot of fun.
B00563M11M|3.0|I love Sam Vimes in the city This one really felt out of place. The way too many references to poo and snot was definately a no-no....Why? Discworld has always been fun without focusing on potty humor. I still love Discworld and always will.
B004J4WLB4|4.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The description and analogy of flowers was fascinating to me and gave the story an extra dimension.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|Great purchase and highly satisified! Great seeing Led Zeppelin hasnt missed a beat!!! Even enjoying the CD in my truck!!!
B00633W614|4.0|I found this story and the era it was set in to be a page turner and am excited to read the other books in the trilogy.
0765325950|1.0|I was incredibly excited about this book, but I wanted to purchase it on my Kindle and not the hard cover so I was incredibly disappointed when I heard the Kindle edition would be delayed Four months after the hard back edition. I love this series so much that I was about to cave and buy the hard back, but I then read an article stating that the delay was because Jordan's wife demanded the delay. She evidently didn't want to \\"worry that her husband's legacy will be undermined if sales are split between ebooks and hardcovers, preventing the last book of the Wheel of Time from hitting number one on either list.\\" Her decision to game the system (and possibly make a lot more money) has really disappointed me so I'm expressing that disappointment in two ways: 1. Writing this review and 2. Getting a copy of the book from the library.
B003THHIEM|5.0|Love this show!!! Has a great plot and story line, funny!!! Really makes you think about how it's all going to work out!!
B004UC4HCG|4.0|I bought the Shuttle SH67H3 and put a Core i5 3570K, Samsung 830 SSD, 8GB GSkill Ripjaws RAM from Shuttle's supported RAM list, Lite-on Blu-Ray burner, and USB card reader.  Windows 7 was missing a bunch of drivers after install, but the included driver DVD cleared that up pretty easily.  This system is really quick, and so far completely stable.  The included cables and screws made mounting everything a lot easier than it should be for a case this small.  It's a really well thought out case, so everything just seems like it has a place to go.<br /><br />The only down side, and the reason it's getting 4 stars instead of 5, is that the fan is noisy.  It's not deafening, but I was expecting to barely hear it, and it is loud enough to be annoying.  I did some googling, and found somebody on Youtube whose fan sounds just like mine.  He replaced the fan with a Gelid FN-PX09-20 92mm Case Fan ($12 on Amazon), so hopefully that works for me, too.
B00991TCOG|5.0|This was a gift for my son for Christmas and he loves it!  She is a very talented young lady and is a great role model for young violinist.  Shipping was great.
B0085YNML2|4.0|The game puts an interesting twist on getting from point A to point B. The physics and mechanics are fun. Some of the levels are nice and changing.
B00A1C1DYE|5.0|I just started watching this show and I love it! I liked it so much on TV i had to see all the episodes I missed! Im very happy with this set! Im looking forward to grabbing Season 6 when it is out on Blueray!
B004BRQYJ4|5.0|The quality of the sound of the songs is excellent.  Well worth the amount you pay.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoyed the movie.  It also helps to be able to hear it at work!
B008HT4FUW|5.0|GREAT! Loved it. For whatever reason I didn't start watching this a couple of years ago. So I had to get caught up before season 3. Great show!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Nicholas sparks has done it again with one of the best books I have read in awhile. I could not put this book down,I loved the twists and turns of this book. And I immediately fell in love with all the characters! Can't wait for the movie!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I cant put it down!!! I get home from school I never stop u should try it don't even need money get it
B008D36INE|2.0|Although the critics liked this movie I found it boring and over acted.  The music was so over bearing it distracted from the actors lines..
B00005MKA3|5.0|This is probably the least celebrated Marley album and yet I think it is the best. I have heard every Bob Marley song ever recorded and own every Marley album that was ever released and I must say that this is my favorite album as every song is filled with emotion as Bob demands justice and equality for all.<br /><br />Babylon System and One Drop are two of my favorite Marley songs of all time and quite honestly every song on the album is great as they are either politically charged or worshiping Jah.<br /><br />If you haven't listened to this album yet, I highly recommend you listen to it as soon as possible. You won't regret it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I challenge anyone under the age of 40 to watch this movie and not sing along. This movie was pure fun, plain and simple, with a highly talented cast of entertainers. The story was a bit weak, as it usually is with this type of film, but the musical numbers are infectious and it is impossible not to grin from ear to ear while watching this film. The musical numbers were very, very well done and Rebel Wilson was absolutely and unequivocally the best part of the entire thing. She stole every scene she was in and it's my personal belief that the film's most hilarious moments start and end with her. Watch this movie!
034580404X|5.0|It arrived a day early. No damages to the books and it's a good thing because I have a pet-peeve with dented corners. Going to start reading it soon on my leisure time.
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|adobe Reader really like it on my laptop hope it works as well on my kindle for the time to use itcan wait
B004EPZ034|5.0|Very Very cute movie .  Both for young and old.  Music is great along with the Chipmunks.  Cant go wrong with this DVD
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|like using this search engine on my laptop hopefully it will work as well on my kindle havent had a chance to use it
B002ZG98FU|5.0|The movie was great. It also had some great music. The film's theme song is, \\"Strip Me,\\" by Natasha Bedingfield. Another song called, \\"Same Changes,\\" sung by The Weepies was recorded exclusively for the film. David Arnold composed the film score. A soundtrack album wasn't released. I, like millions of other fans of, \\"Morning Glory,\\" feel there should be a soundtrack album. So I wrote to whoever's in charge at Paramount Pictures, suggesting the same thing. Hopefully, that person might pull through on that suggestion. Anyway, the movie seemed like it was a take on many morning talk shows.
B00846REIS|2.0|Was disappointed in this...seemed like a bad ripoff of 50 shades of Grey.  It was entertaining enough but not enough so that I would purchase the 2nd or 3rd book in the series.
B0071MQBX0|5.0|the logistics of putting this show togethher and how successfully they pulled it off  is amazing.  one of my favorite shows
0060558121|1.0|This book was absolutely terrible. I was constantly waiting for it to get good. I was expecting there to be at least a little excitement; all that it was was just terrible writing along with pointless sex scenes, especially one with two men. That is completely despicable and should never be included in any writing. I literally almost gagged and had to skip forward. I completely wasted my time and money on this poor excuse for a novel. It was like watching a terrible movie. I suggest that no one reads this and every copy be burned.
B002VPE1XE|4.0|Fits the camera.  I loan this to someone in an elementary school setting and it helps protect the camera from damage.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|We don't ever watch TV, however we love horror films...all kinds...and a good story line. We did fall in love with &#34;The Walking Dead&#34; and then stumbled upon the first season of American Horror Story. From the very first episode it was amazing! Great character development, wonderful plot twists, actors that makes the show even more fantastic! We were hooked after season 1, bought up all we could of season 2 and are just as happy with it. AHS continues to satisfy on every way! Oh....and p.s. Jessica Lange is flipping phenomenal in every way...just saying.
B00A8SPNYW|5.0|I like this game! Great graphics and fun gameplay. You have to leave a scent trail from the cheese to the mouse. Each level gets increasingly difficult. I'll look forward to seeing how hard the later levels get.
6305001162|5.0|Grease is a fun-filled movie taking the viewer back to a time when America and American culture were changing from a poverty-stricken era to a time of care-free living. And yet, people are still the same struggling with love and competition and growing up. The extras for the 20th Anniversary Edition made the entertainment even more enjoyable. All &#34;Bomers&#34; should watch it.
B008PWUYVA|4.0|This is a wonderful cover for the Kindle Fire. The material feels very sturdy and it is easy to use as a stand. It feels very nice to the touch.<br /><br />The only reason I am not giving it 5 stars is that my Kindle is not completely snug and slides around a bit.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|So good<br /> I love this book ....and in that moment I swear we were infinite.highly recommend for people of all ages
B006CR2PI0|4.0|The movie itself is fancy but the scenes of erotic dance performed by Demi Moore are fantastic, Love to se it over and over again.<br /><br />carlos
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|The beginning is dull, and written in a dreadful style full of bland British similes. The middle is better; there is more action and characterization. The writing style gets better. The last 75-80 pgs. are much better. Very touching, and written much better.<br /><br />I'm turning this book into the used bookstore. I can't believe this was actually listed as one of the Top 100 of 2012! The standards must have been lowered in literature...
B0063IH60K|3.0|it is what it is.. it is just your typical solitaire game and if that is what you want then you will enjoy it.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|One of the greatest films ever. Endlessly quotable and unforgettable. The packaging for this is simply brilliant. Worth every penny. I rarely buy these kinds of sets but when you combine a movie like this with such an amazing presentation, its a must buy!
B000O8OTNC|3.0|this is a good item.. I used it a few times and placed it into my suvival bag.. I comes in handy
B008Y5OWO8|5.0|Classic in every sense. Unbelievable transfer. Criterion has done it again!! This simply has to be in any blu-ray collection
B004SBS8LA|3.0|not a bad game. it is an angry bird game just like the rest of them. I have the whole series but burt out of them
B00004BZ0N|5.0|London Calling is a masterpiece of an album by the band that many people consider to be punk rock, The Clash. Well, they certainly have punk roots and their songs reflect the punk attitude, lyrically for sure. The Clash aren't what I would call a definitive punk band, because when I think of punk music, I think of something edgier and faster. The appealing thing about this album, however, is that the listener is treated to songs that have an underlying punk sound and theme, all the while having a nice beat and great vocals. What's more is that the listener is treated to an array of genres, such as rock, pop, reggae, and hard rock while maintaining the punk tone. All of the songs are great, but if I had to pick a top 5, I would go with LONDON CALLING, LOST IN THE SUPERMARKET, CLAMPDOWN, DEATH OR GLORY, and I'M NOT DOWN. One can't go wrong with this legendary recording from 1979 that left a permanent mark on how music is supposed to be made and enjoyed. Finally, London Calling is considered a double album, so there's more to enjoy for a good price. The sound remastering is very good, too.
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|Love the series and the extra case was just great. Mine did not lock when you twisted the screw like it was described but that is a small think for a cool case.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I enjoyed this one.<br /><br />Introverts are more sensitive, their comfortable level of external stimulation is lower, and they are less likely to pursue any reward. Which all sounds like downsides. But on the upsides, they tend to listen well, are good at tasks requiring focus, and less likely to jump off a cliff to get illusory reward.<br /><br />In the job setting, introverts on any team are often not heard, which is bad when they raise valid concerns about cavalier plans made by extroverts. Also, they would work better with limited interruptions, and in private workspaces. Managers who are introverts have an edge over extroverts when leading proactive people.<br /><br />And both on work and outside, knowing your personality type and adjusting your lifestyle accordingly is likely to make you happier.<br /><br />In retrospect, it is obvious. But nothing of that occurred to me before, and I never though about what personality type I have, much less what personality type my colleagues have.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|not bad but didn't last long on my phone.. I wasn't to impressed and will look for a more interesting version
B00A136CUI|5.0|I can't get enough of this Album! I have it on repeat constantly! I love new/different styles of music. Lana Del Ray has done that perfectly and more in this CD. Favorite songs?? ALL of them! But if I had to pick one, Diet Mountain Dew. THANK YOU Lana Del Rey!
B000VOC90Y|5.0|My husband described it and I shopped for it!  It came in timely, and was exactly what was described!  It is great quality!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Maybe it's because I'm older (48) and my reading time is more valuable.  A bad book is extremely disappointing but a good one like 11/22/63 makes me happy happy happy.  I haven't read them all but I've read several SK's over my life with mixed feelings at the end.  They've all been compelling page turners, shocking, horrifying, interesting concepts but this one is by far the most complete. It is satisfying to the last page.  Reality may be a little more scary than the supernatural.
B00338QENI|3.0|This book is very educational and the author's research extensive. I enjoyed reading the parts about Henrietta's life and family, although their mistreatment by the medical community is sad and upsetting.<br /><br />There is so much information about cells and medical procedures, that I found myslef skimming through these sections. For someone more knowledgeable about and interested in science and technology, I'm sure this book would be much more appealing.
030758836X|4.0|I am so glad I picked up this book. Flynn sure knows how to write a mystery that keeps you on your toes and guessing. For the lack of a better cliche, I was NOT able to put this book down. The story line perfectly mixes past with present as they merge into one. Husband and wife's story told separately but together as they grow together, apart and together. As another reviewer noted, the author acknowledges not knowing how to finish the novel about 80% of the way through and this is entirely obvious. The ending was indeed a let down. Such a great build up almost to the very end, but the conflict resolution was weak, boring and does not do the evil-mindedness of the characters any justice whatsoever.<br /><br />Either way, worth a read. You will not be disappointed, until the very end :)
B00AECGQF2|5.0|granddaughters love to snip and color hair, it is a fun app. that they enjoy, no educational value if that is what you are looking for but if you just want something fun, this app is great
B003O86FMW|5.0|What an interesting book series. The first one ended with some closure but this one leaves everything hanging wide open. A fabulous story of friendship, adventure, love, trust, and rebellion all rolled into one. Can't wait to get my hands on that final book!
0894803123|5.0|I use this book a lot.  It has something for everyone in it and many new ideas that I wouldn't have thought of before.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I think this is a great game. Its very fun, and addicting. you can play at your own pace,too. Finally, a balanced game to bring out the evil genius in ourselves.
B0026NWBY2|3.0|I liked some of the songs George sings in this CD.  The only thing I do not like is that some of the songs are not too clear.  I am not sure whether it is live but it seems that some of the songs are lacking quality.

B008476HBM|3.0|I chose this book because of the author's fame but found I could not relate to it just now.  I will try to read this book again, later.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|The game has many games in it making it fun for one. The game gives you something to do for car rides and other long period boring objects.
0061726834|5.0|I put off reading this book because I thought is was a sappy love story (the description mentioned being \\"sick with love\\" and that was not something I enjoy reading). I love dystopian novels with a hint of love and that is what this ended up being for me. Most of it is a quest to find the truth, which adds a bit of a \\"mystery\\" element too.<br /><br />The writing itself is beautiful, she does a great job of foreshadowing without giving away too much. The ending was a complete surprise to me, which is one of the main reasons I liked the book so much. (Also the ending to Pandimonium is equally as awesome).<br /><br />The only criticism I have - is there are a few times that she jumps around. For example, Lena at one point is stressing about getting home before curfew, and she doesn't know what her aunt will think of her soaking wet with salt water. However, the next scene isn't of her rushing home. Rather it turns into the next day. Scenes like this could have been elaborated a bit more to add more suspense. For example, \\"I was so distracted that I nearly ran head on into a regulator, and Aunt Carol wouldn't let me in the house, so I came up with another lie...\\"blah blah<br /><br />The book actually gives some great insight on an aspect of our society that always seems like a second thought to me - that love could very well be considered a disease - and that it can be the root of some evil. If you think back to history and even modern times, you can see some evidence of love having the characteristics of a disease and causing problems - a perfect example is Helen of Troy - the young love of Helen and the prince brought their country to war. But then through the book you realize, especially through Lena, that life without love is not worth living.<br /><br />Anyway, it is a close second to Hunger Games to me. I recommend reading it!<br />It's dystopian, mystery, action, adventure, suspense, realistic, romance...all the good things that made Hunger Games successful.
B0002CVQCW|4.0|I received the DVD today and  I was greatly disappointed. The DVDS  are unplayable In th United States. I tried to play them in two  DVD payers. They are not playable in the Unitesd States.  You must warn  future buyers that DVDs from United Kingdom are unplayable in  the United States. I hope that you will notify me if you do get this concert in Blu Ray or DVD that will play on Blu Ray  players or DVD players in the United States.The concert is great because I have  the VCR  and I ordered the DVD hoping that the sound and video would be better than the VCR.  Please stop  all orders  of this  concert from the United Kingdom  Tomorrow  I have to return the concert and . I have to pay the postage.  I am usually pleased with  past purchases from Amazon and the return method, but not this time.  After paying  $6.90 to return  the dvdsto the United Kingdom today I received an email that I could mail to  New Jersey. Please try to insert return address  of New Jersey not the United Kingdm.  I hope this review  will warn future Amazon  buyers  of this video.

B00A9X9VAI|5.0|Not a bad movie at all and definately worth a watch.  Thought I would see more Bruce Willis but that is not the case.  Still a great plot and wonderful Sci Fi flick.
B007FIY3VW|1.0|I bought this app to read power points and to read word documents. I didn't want it to create documents, just to read them. I was not able to open any of my power points and the word documents would not import charts. This app is completely useless to me. I would not recommend to anyone.

B008JFUTUY|5.0|Saw this at the Traverse City film festival last summer; afterwards there was a Q&A with the director and star. What an amazing experience.<br /><br />This documentary is about an immensely gifted songwriter and performer who fell into obscurity in the 1970s but whose music experienced a highly-deserved revival in recent years--first in other countries, and eventually (thanks in part to this excellent film) here in the U.S.<br /><br />Rodriguez' story is heart-warming and uplifting, and the man himself is just amazing and kind and good.  Warning:  after watching this film, you WILL want to buy his CDs (and Amazon sells them).<br /><br />The film itself is so well-crafted.  The cinematography, the pacing, editing, use of Rodriguez' music and integration of family videos, all used to great effect.  \\"Searching for Sugarman\\" is already being studied by film-making students in several universities.<br /><br />In short, very highly recommended.  Best documentary of 2012, easily.
B004U52VPS|5.0|Bought this as a gift for 3 & 5 year old boys who love the ap, and we just took the cards and put them up. They have just so much fun setting it up and flinging those birds. great gift!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The seasons are separated into nice folders that I could take with me, if I was going somewhere. The case is really nice, too. Of course, as soon as it came, The West Wing came available on that downloadable movie and tv watching service, but that's how it goes. This is a nice product.
B005PK553C|4.0|The first half of season one is awesome, but somewhere along the way it jumps the shark and turns into utter nonsense. Great acting, but the writing just fell off a cliff after the Halloween episode.  Yes, Jessica Lange is fantabulous and perfectly campy! I could have done without the school shooter storyline.
B004XMMSZG|1.0|I read about the Cable Jive Air in a review of new products in the NYTimes.  So I ordered it.  It was on back-order for 5 weeks.  When it came the packing slip contained no phone number for the company.  So I looked it up.  They are blocking all calls. You get a menu and then when you press the option that is for support it disconnects the phone call.<br /><br />So I used the web site to ask my question:  I can't seem to get the device to sinc with my iPhone5. The product also came with no instructions whatsoever.  So unlike those who have written that it quits in a few minutes, I cannot even get it to start.No answer to my inquiry in 48 hours.  That seems long enough.<br /><br />If a company selling an electronic device does not provide any customer support whatsoever, then I can only choose what they really deserve:  I am returning the product and writing this negative review.<br /><br />My disappointment begins with Bose, who sell expensive docks and have not kept up with the new designs of iPhone 5 and others.  I always held them in such high regard and now I am wondering what happened to the great Bose?
B009K0P10K|4.0|Season one of Revenge might be one of the best shows ever, so it's not surprising that season 2 isn't quite as good. I'm still really enjoying it, and it is worth watching. However, I really find the Aiden character very boring, and I'd like to see more of Nolan and the conniving Ashley.
B0070UFMOW|2.0|This is a somewhat mixed review of the FiiO E17.<br /><br />Mine arrived dead in the water.  It would not turn on unless/until it was plugged in.  Ok, so no big deal, it just needs to be charged, right?  Wrong. Even after charging over-night, it wouldn't turn on unless it was plugged in.  Bummer.<br /><br />The E17 is pretty simple.  One shouldn't need to consult the (dreadful) manual, unless there are problems.  Well, since I had major problems, I needed to read the manual to make sure I wasn't missing something.  Aside from comic relief (assuming you find bad Engrish funny), the manual is pretty useless.  Again, that wouldn't be an issue if the unit was working properly.<br /><br />After researching and troubleshooting for hours, I finally came to the conclusion that the unit I recieved was simply defective.  Bummer x 2.<br /><br />And to make it Bummer^3 (cubed), Amazon won't replace it because it was sold by another vendor and fulfilled by Amazon.  So, my only recourse was to send it back for a refund.  While this is understandable, and the folks at Amazon have been extremely helpful, it's still the 3rd strike.  Yer Out!<br /><br />I will say that I gave it an additional star because the E17, when working, seemed like a great product.  I WAS able to plug it into a laptop via USB (it charges via USB and hence worked for me) and the results were stunning.  Using the E17 as a DAC for your computer was amazing.  The music sounded full, rich and extended.  Much better than the PC or Mac's DAC capabilities.  Given the processing power of the computers I use, this was a pleasant surprise.  Unfortunately, I need it to work with all my mobile devices, too - and due to the defect, this was not an option.<br /><br />I've already spent WAY too much time on this product, both in terms of troubleshooting and reviewing.  Maybe some day, when I have some spare time, I will order again and hope I get a working product.  In the meantime, 2 stars.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Works for me.  I use this for relaxation when it time to shut down for the night plus its fun to play.
B00A2LOAKI|3.0|While this doesn't flinch in the face of Frank Miller's daring, classic source material, it manages to fail in other ways - some avoidable, others a helpless victim of the format. Readers concerned about potential scene-trimming or the censorship of important, risque spots in the graphic novel can rest easy. It's all here, from Reagan in a haz-mat suit to the Joker's talk show appearance, with only two notable alterations: the identity of the TV host (whose replacement is actually a great surprise) and the crash-landing location of a disabled aircraft (it falls on a crowded city street, rather than into a skyscraper). Otherwise, it's a raw, direct translation that's especially effective during the major action sets - the final battle between Batman and his lifelong rival is downright incredible. Where it falls short - infuriatingly, unforgivably, and universally - is in its voice acting. Never have I heard a more mundane, emotionless series of performances in a major production. It's flat from start to finish, robbing landmark scenes of their emotional power and eradicating the vigor that oozed from the printed page. Granted, much of Miller's dialog is Lucasian, in that it works far better in print than on the screen, but even a remotely talented cast should have been able to compensate for that with an appropriately passionate delivery. Instead, we get a wounded Joker asking Batman \\"Are you out of your mind?\\" in a dull, straight monotone, rather than the shocked, manic shriek I heard in my mind upon first turning that page. Perhaps I've been spoiled by so many years of classics from Kevin Conroy and Mark Hamill, because, for me, there was just no looking past these performances. Which is a shame, because the animation is wonderfully fluid and appropriate, and the plot still remains startlingly timely. A painful wasted opportunity
B000G6R7B8|2.0|I've owned several Seiko watches over the years and this is the first one that really dissapointed me. I liked the looks and the fact that it was self winding, so I bought it. Doesn't take long for for the leather strip surrounding the clasp holes to deteriorate and become discolored which makes the appearance quite unattractive. More importantly, it doesn't keep accurate time. It gains about two minutes a day. I can only guess that this is because the self winding mechanism doesn't function properly.

B007MAETA8|5.0|I don't write reviews very often.  I was intrigued by the word on the street about this CD when it was released.  I kept thinking, \\"I should get his new cd\\" well, I am the king of procrastinators and didn't buy it until November 2012.  I can't quit listening to it.  I try to listen to something else, and keep coming back to this cd.  One of my Favorites of recent history :-)<br /><br />If you like good guitar work and easy, mellow songs with great lyrics and melody give this one a listen.  You won't regret it.
1439190275|1.0|Lots of research pertinent to the Atkin's diet have emerged in the past decade. I am very impressed by Dr. Volek and Dr. Phinney 's book \\"The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Living\\" 2012, so much that I read the book cover to cover twice in detail. I was expecting the same scientific based explanation for this well revered diet because the book is coauthored by the two scientists. I am very disappointed. This author has a wonderful talent of writing verbose volumes about cliches [knowledge about the diet most diet-conscious readers already have] and keep harping on the same string over and over again so that after about 1/3 through the book, I found myself flipping the pages to find the new knowledge supporting this diet but to no avail. This 303 pages book can be summarized in a few pamphlets regarding the diet or a visit to the many websites about dieting. I am surprised to see the other two authors consented to be coauthors because their book belongs to a totally higher calibre both in terms of depth of knowledge and credibility. If you want to know the impact of different carbs, instead of making a copy of the carbohydrates ladder or memorizing them , please read Dr. Eric Thompson's The Glycemic Load Diet. There, you don't have to do carb counting, AEC. CCL, grams, four arbitrary phases of the diet to make it sound more scientific and accurate. You will learn to look at the food and tell which are the good and bad carbs whether your are at home, in the restaurant, at a party or in a fast food place.

B003JTHXOK|4.0|Great read. Romance, suspense, and a beautiful twist. Left me feeling great. Looking forward to seeing the movie in a few months.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is great - the problem with the battery icon on any device I find is that you can never really tell how much longer you have left - could be 10% or 25%. I find this app really helpful and I haven't seen it drain the battery at all. Great!

B005LJETYI|4.0|This is a great read along the lines of Armor, Starship Troopers, and even Old Man's War - whose talented author, John Scalzi, has a quote on the cover of this book.  While this book is not as profound as those books (especially Armor, which is a recommended read), this book doesn't intend to be.  Without pretensions toward being grander than it is, the book doesn't get bogged down - it stays rail-thin and mean throughout.  It's fun, has some thrills, and even presents a few interesting ideas along the way.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Just as funny now as it was originally!  The cast was perfectly cast!  This is still a &#34;side buster&#34;.  I could hardly stop laughing.

0345803485|3.0|I am a psychologist and therapist to many successful professional women in relationships with abusive men. The first book of the Trilogy includes an accurate and sensitive portrayal of the emotional conflicts experienced by most women who get involved (and stay involved) with disturbed, vulnerable, sadomasochistic men. I was impressed by the author's ability to convey Ana's struggle between sexual attraction to Christian's sadomasochism, her fearful efforts to save herself, and her emotional need to heal Christian with her love. In my experience, however, women who get emotionally addicted to emotionally damaged, abusive men always come from childhood backgrounds in which they were similarly abused by male family members. The author did not develop a childhood story for Ana that would account for her behavior with Christian, even though she did a reasonably good job of connecting Christian's emotional problems with his history of childhood physical and sexual abuse. The author also did a good job of sustaining a portrayal of an Ana who is very difficult to like. The female character is immature for her age and consistently passive-aggressive, to the point where I sometimes wished Christian would carry out his worst threats!<br /><br />As a resident of the Pacific Northwest, I would have to say that the description of Ana's sexual history is not credible at all. It is extremely unlikely that any reasonably attractive, 21 year old college student living in Portland would be a virgin, with the possible exception of a small number of women raised in unusually restrictive religious environments. Ana is presented as a young woman with a strong interest in sex, including a willingness to explore BDSM. People living in Portland are exposed to a full range of sexual opportunities, and college seniors would be expected to have accumulated considerable experience with ordinary sex, as well as at least some knowledge about BDSM.<br /><br />The primary reason for the success ofthe Trilogy among female readers is undoubtedly the author's ability to sustain sexual tension over many pages, building up to highly detailed descriptions of intense sexual scenes. She does a better job with this than most authors of erotic literature. Granted, the author sometimes goes on too long with the filler material, to the point of losing the reader's interest, but I was impressed by her talent for building sexual anticipation.<br /><br />My overall impression is that the Trilogy's author is very talented, but the Trilogy could have been greatly improved by the advice of an equally talented but much more experienced editor. I skipped most of the second book, and I think that the third book also does not measure up to the first.

B00ARAN9JW|3.0|I really like Milla Jovovich in this series and enjoyed her as a more mature heroine.  However, the film in general didn't have the kick the previous films had.  However, I probably would watch another &#34;Underworld &#34; film provided Mills Jovovich reprised her role.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Refreshingly different from other stories. This avid reader enjoyed the suspense and each twist and turn of the arena. Looking for the next one.
0765325950|5.0|This book was wonderful!  Both heartbreaking and triumphant.  My husband and I both loved it.  That said, yes, it would have been nice to have a kindle version.  Do I think that this hardcover version deserves a load of 1 star ratings because there is not e-book yet?  NO!!<br /><br />Amazon needs to remove all of these 1-star reviews complaining about the e-book.  If you are as bothered by this as I am, please contact them and ask them to remove them.
B00884GR0W|5.0|This is an awesome experience. If you like the survival aspect of minecraft you will love this game. This is not minecraft this game looks like it but it is all about the role playing aspect of it. This game is all about the questing,leveling,and survival, and its slot of fun.

It's sad to see when an author goes from \\"can't miss\\" to \\"don't bother.\\" For me, this has been the situation over the past several books; and after The Panther, I will not be able to bring myself to read any more books by DeMille.<br /><br />I won't spend time describing the plot of The Panther since you can get this from the Amazon Book Description above. I will say, however, that the plot is tissue paper thin, overly bloated, mostly predictable and, except for the last 60-70 pages, seriously lacking in action and suspense. As a result of my disappointment with the plot I considered giving up on the book at various times. Instead, out of a sense of respect for an author that used to be one of my favorites, I decided to read on -- but I could only get to the end by skimming through many passages.<br /><br />While I obviously didn't care much for the book's plot, my biggest problem with The Panther pertains to what has become a steadily growing dislike of DeMille's main character, John Corey, who has been featured in six books. His portrayal in The Panther is now \\"the straw that broke the camel's back\\" for me. I no longer can tolerate Corey's constant wise cracks and know-it-all attitude, which is much more annoying to me than humorous. This is disturbing because I had always considered character development to be a major strength of DeMille's in his early works. Yet, in The Panther all of the characters are one-dimensional and the villain -- who is rarely \\"seen\\" -- has some serious credibility issues.<br /><br />Based on my above comments, it is obvious that I don't recommend this book. I know my one-star rating is perhaps going to upset some DeMille fans who want to read his latest work, and result in them giving my review a \\"no/not helpful\\" vote. Hopefully, however, other potential readers will view my review as helpful, in that it provides \\"food for thought\\" that differs from the majority opinion expressed to-date.\\"no/not helpful\\" vote.

B005LAJ1HW|5.0|2 YEARS IN A ROW - GREAT GIFT. AS LONG AS THEY MAKE THIS SERIES I WILL BUY IT<br />ONE OF MY SON'S FAVORITE GIFTS
B004TI5N38|5.0|I really look forward to more Baldacci adventures with John Puller.  It was fast moving and a great read for anyone who likes action, adventure with a hint of &#34;whodunnit&#34;!
B00004RJ71|5.0|I loved this movie! I had this movie in VHS form so happy I have now found it as a DVD. This is an older movie but still so good. Loved it!
B006VFLIYK|4.0|The opening had you immediately if you are a mystery/thriller addict as I am. Then Baldacci shows his sensitivity with the interaction between Robie and Julie.  It was a good read, fast paced and totally entertaining.
B009MCRHH6|5.0|I really enjoy this game a lot!  We purchased it when it first came out for the Nintendo Wii, and I loved it then.<br />Having it at my fingertips... literally... is convenient and awesome!<br /><br />This game is both challenging and amusing!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was surprised by how engaging the was story given its science fiction trappings. The characters are well rounded and the futuristic ideas are intriguing and well thought out.
6305212112|5.0|Great movie. One of the very few movies that I actually like better than the book. I highly recommend it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I usually borrow books from the library and buy them after reading if I like them. However, the hype surrounding the Fifty Shades were very seductive and after talking to the fifth person I saw on the train clutching the second book, I decided to purchase the bundle outright.<br /><br />What a waste!<br /><br />Written in the language of secondary school student, Anastasia is another Bella. I hate to say it but even that vampire trilogy is a better read. I an avid reader and I can devour one book in a day. I also love romance among other genres and I read historical as well as modern romances. I read from Jude Deveraux to Emily Griffin, Nora Roberts to Mary Balogh and so on. With this book, I could not even finish the first book. I forced myself to read it, but it just annoyed me too much and I finally gave up.<br /><br />I am so angry with myself for buying this trash and I wish I had bought the Hunger Games instead. I borrowed those from the library... :(
B000VKJ6VS|3.0|I never listened to it as it was a gift to my son.  I think I heard one song on the radio and it is definitly not my type of music.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful story I have ever read.<br />It reminds me of \\"The Help\\" and both makes me cry...
1451629192|2.0|Please understand how hard it is for me to give this book such a low rating and that I am not judging what Jaycee went through in anyway nor am I judging her. What Jaycee went through was heartbreaking and horrible and I am so glad that she is now safe with friends and family. She is a truly amazing woman.<br />The low review comes from the really badly written book. It jumps around, is distracting and to be really honest here you can get all the really important parts in her TV interview about the book. That may sound harsh and I don't mean to come off that way, I do understand why she wrote the book and that is a very noble reason to write a book about her story but it does not change the fact that the book is really badly written.<br />I wish you the best Jaycee and hope that one day you do become a famous writer like you wanted to in your book.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This book is so good that I missed my stop several times as I was too engrossed in the story to remember where I was. I finished the first book in just a few days and I bought the bundle in kindle. Now I have to force myself to stop reading it and look up once in a while to make sure I get off the train.<br />Many people compared this book to Lord of the Ring and it is the same genre, but it is so much better. The Lord of the Ring can get pretty boring, especially when it gets to the elf songs and those stuff. This book is rich, but fast and it will grip you to the end!
B004J4XGN6|5.0|It is really difficult to write about startups, and specially create new and feasible methods to create new startups.<br /><br />As a Digital Marketing Expert and Book Author ([[ASIN:B007EZYQD6 Internet Marketing for Small Businesses (Internet for Business)]]), I know that usually Internet books falls in two categories: \\"common sense\\" or \\"not worth\\" types. But on The Lean Startup, Eric Ries, was able to both: Write something really new, and really worth to try.<br /><br />For sure, the general theory is based on Lean Manufacturing, and the like, but the book explain in details how and why apply Lean concept to startups, using including personal author experience, and real practical examples.<br /><br />For sure, this book will change the way you think about your startup business.<br /><br />By the way, you can use this book even if your startup is not about Internet.
B003U6BE8I|5.0|Enjoyed it!  Liked the ctors very much! The directing ws excellent nd well done.  I loved the movie more thn I thought it would.
B00AA36RZY|5.0|Tried original GoF which was a bit heavy for me... this is one simple, clear and fun to read. Really enjoying it now :)
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This movie has more heart in it than can be expected from most animated movies.  Heck, it tackles many of life's issues better than a whole marathon of sappy Lifetime Channel dramas and it will not wring you out, it will lift you up!  While watching this movie, everyone in the room will find someone to identify with, from the smallest child to the oldest adult and anyone in between.  It's one of the movies that needs to be watched a couple of times because it has so much packed into it.  It's funny, inspirational, and even surprisingly sad (kids won't catch the sad parts the way that adults will understand them).  Watch this one together...you'll miss out if you use this one to simply entertain the kids while you cook dinner.  It's well worth the whole family's time and attention.
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This book was a great read from beginning to end. Could not put it down! Morgan Rice is such a wonderful author!
B0049J2CKE|5.0|There aren't very many movies that are appropriate for everyone.  This one is great for young children all the way up to older adult.  It will be appreciated by all, sometimes for common reasons and other times for very personal ones.  There's a great message here that our children are missing out on sometimes:  it takes action to do something great (simply being born and taking up space doesn't make you special).  Everyone needs to be reminded that, with a little effort, \\"anyone can cook\\" (or do anything else that they dream of).
0131103628|5.0|What can really be said about this book other than &#34;Get It&#34;<br />if you are trying to learn C this is the go to book.
B000PMG16U|5.0|I know that many have complained that this comes in a smaller package, but I love it! Less clutter in my house.
B003R0MF5I|4.0|The only reason that I rated this season of Chuck a 4, instead of a 5, is that the first three seasons were even better.
B005LAII80|5.0|This version of the Judge Dredd Comic Book story is much truer to the source. Karl Urban played Judge Dredd very well and in a precise minimalistic way. That is what the role called for.<br />Lena Headey was very good as the evil Ma-Ma. She really shows her acting versatility as a scarred up ex-prostitute in the film.<br />The actress playing the psychic Judge Anderson was decent as well.<br />The DTS Mastersound was out of this world. The scene music was appropriate and fit the film well.<br />I do not have a 3D TV, but the picture was phenomonal on my 42 inch LG in in normal 2D mode. The film is widescreen so there are black bars across the top and bottom even on a 16x9 ratio display.<br />The film had a new type of slow motion photography that was filmed in about 3,000 frames per second. I have never seen anything linke it. It is exceptional.<br />Almost the entire move takes place inside Peach Trees Tower, there is only a brief street action scene at the beginning of the film. The conceptualization of Mega City was excellent CGI, I have no complaints. The weapons in this film are absolutely monster. The film is very violent. There is plenty of action, shooting, and blood in the film. There is not really any nudity.<br />The film was made in South Africa and Post Production done in London.<br />The extras seem interesting, although I have not watched them all yet. The extra about the history and development of Judge Dredd in the English comics was interesting and informative.
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|The first three seasons of Chuck were absolutely excellent.  I'm not saying 4 and 5 aren't good, but the first three are the best.
