B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Chromecast was pushed out too fast and I as well as many others are owed a quality product. I bought this thing with the intention of using it to play local content and being able to stream what ever I wanted. When I go to a site such as Solarmovie I want to be able to see the movie streamed instead I get a black screen. I paid 100.00 for this when it first was launched on Ebay. I want my monies worth. So far I have no use at all and it has been siting on my desk for months.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|beautifully written, page turning, thoughtful novel with wonderful research. The characters are enduring, an intriguing tale about a dark and mysterious culture.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I can't imagine a smoother or easier calculator to use  than this. Get it, you won't be disappointed. And it's free!
B00EEDNA4M|2.0|Too bad. I ended up choosing one at the store that had an issue inside. Mine had no season 4 and two season 3 discs. Other than that, the set was what I expected. Pretty great to have had the whole series, even if it was for a little while (I returned it obviously). And it was at Costco so it was cheaper too. Just my luck. Oh well. At least I got to see the 2 hour documentary, which I would give a 7/10. I'll probably just end up buying the separate blu ray seasons since it's cheaper now that I've gotten to experience the set. Got my BB Barrel fix. I'll give the set 8/10 overall assuming I had gotten all the right seasons.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Well written court room drama.  It keeps you guessing until the very end.  It will keep your interest during the entire book.
B00B6CVTBU|5.0|Best JoBo album for a long while, really superb sound and good quality recording. This vinyl should be in anyone collection.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|I discovered Grisham last month on vacation after hearing an interview with him on NPR's Diane Rehm show. I have always passed by his books even though members of my family are big Grisham fans. So, in anticipation of reading Sycamore Row, I read A Time to Kill, his first novel and the prequel to Sycamore, first. I sailed thru A Time To Kill...but sort of sputtered here with Sycamore. Maybe I overdosed on one voice. That said, this book is compelling...and, at times moves with rocket speed. Any reader can likely guess what is coming, but when it hits...it is too fast...and only with some historical numbers (context)sort of crammed in as afterthought. Without giving it away, I wanted more from the climax...more than the observer's view than what I received. I wanted the victims' views. So that's a lot of griping for four stars...<br />I guess this is my takeaway: Grisham is a great courtroom storyteller. Both of these books are page turners. At the end of both books, I knew Jake Brigance somewhat well. But other recurring characters, like Jake's wife, remained flat and not at all memorable.<br />Am I happy I found Grisham? Indeed. This made for great poolside reading. Will I seek out his other works? Possibly, but I need to hear another writer's voice (or three)in my head before I would consider it.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|THIS GAME IS ADDICTIVE AND ALSO UPSETS ME WHEN I'M ON ONE LEVEL TO LONG.... REMINDS ME OF HOW PRESSED I GOT WITH ANGRY BIRD, BUT NEVER STOPPED PLAYING.

B00006878K|5.0|Great album, you can hear how Eric Clapton and Stevie Ray Vaughan were influenced.  Also Booker T's MG's are backing him here.
B008JFUPOY|5.0|It's Monsters University. The story, the characters, and the ending rocked. I loved it so much and will watch it again and again.
B005LAII80|5.0|I really liked the first Judge Dredd movie with Sylvester Stallone and this one is in a lot of ways even better. The story is solid and its very action packed. The Bluray  quality is amazing!
B00GX598FO|5.0|What a cast. I thought the first Red was great, and the second was just as funny and packed with action.  Plus you get what looks like a higher budget for visual effects.

B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Daniel Craig has turned out to be my favorite 007 so far.  But it isn't just Craig.  The Bond movies that Craig has starred in are much more hard-edged and interesting than most of the previous Bond films, which are almost cartoonish in comparison.  The Craig Bond films are much darker and more realistic in many respects than the previous ones.  That doesn't mean, of course, that there aren't plenty of outlandish stunts and and violence that go along with these new 007 incarnations.  After all, that's half the fun of watching these films.  Craig brings a certain credibility to the James Bond character, though, that has always been lacking in those previous films.  While Skyfall is not, in my opinion, as good a film as Casino Royale (my favorite Bond film of all time), it comes very, very close. It is certainly a better Bond film than Quantum of Solace, which I still liked even so. Skyfall is, like Casino Royale, one of the best Bond films yet.  Highly recommended.
B00G5K1MOC|5.0|Another Great Family Movie...Especially Great For The Kids...I Know That Our Niece And Nephew Will Love This Movie. It Was On Their Christmas Wishlist...
B005PW3OS8|4.0|Let me just say that Captain America: The First Avenger is a very well done movie and a great piece of entertainment.  Lots of fun!  See it if you haven't.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I have had the Chromecast for a month now.<br /><br />So far I have streamed with Chromcast with my Android tablet and my laptop using the chrome browser or the Chromecast plugin.  The set up is simple. It is similar to connecting your device via Bluetooth.  Streaming Netflix, Pandora, Hulu +, and Youtube has been smooth.  I have connected my Chromecast to my WiFi network and added my laptop and tablet as my supported devices.<br /><br />The device is a simple USB device (I assume is to power the device via the TV) and you are provided the option to use the provided HDMI wire or the AC power cord that is also provided.  The simplest connection, at least for me, was using the HMDI wire.<br /><br />Things to consider, if you don't use a majority of the supported apps I do not recommend getting this device.<br /><br />Also, I have seen others ask whether or not this device syncs or can connect with their receiver.  This is a fair question.  I was wondering about this too.  I was worried using the device will not allow me to utilize my surround sound that was managed by my receiver and I would reluctantly have to use the speakers on my TV or figure out some way to connect the audio that was to be streamed.  Luckily, when testing the device the audio instantly, automatically, came from my surround sound speakers.  I did not have to do a thing.  Now, I can't say that this could be applied for all receivers, but as this device can connect to your TV via HDMI, if your TV is connected to your receiver than audio thru you receiver shouldn't be a problem.  Again, I am not sure if this works with all receivers.  This is only my logic.<br /><br />Another thing to consider, I am not sure if other users have mentioned this detail.  I have discovered that using Chromecast requires a great deal of broadband as it must be connected with your home network and then synced with your device.  Streaming requires a lot of data.  So if your contract with your ISP does not cover a great dealof data/broadband than you will find yourself frustrated and feel like you're back in the early internet stages when streaming was interrupted by buffering.<br /><br />Also, from my experience while using the device, you can simultaneously stream the content you selected on your device (your laptop, tablet, or phone) and perform other tasks, whatever they may be, without interruption.<br /><br />One thing to keep in mind, once you have selected content to stream, Chromecast will continue to stream it without interruption unless you are having internet issues or discontinue the stream.<br /><br />Let me explain further, I was streaming a youtube playlist via my laptop to the Chromecast device. To test the integrity of the product, I shutdown my laptop assuming this will interrupt my streaming, however it did not.  The playlist continued to play, despite the fact that my laptop was off.  I thought this was cool at first until I was done watching and then turned off my television.  A few minute later, when I turned the TV back on, my playlist was still playing.  It did not pause or was interrupted, the data was still streaming.<br /><br />To solve this I attempted to 'shutdown' the Chromecast device, but the best way that worked for me, was to completely remove the device from the TV.  So now, when I am not using the device, I disconnect it.  Another reason is because when using the internet on any of my synced devices, although I had no desire to stream it truly slowed down my connection, even though I had removed the Chromecast plugin from my Chromebrowser.<br /><br />If you're someone who uses the internet  a lot or one that likes to reserve energy, keep this in mind.  However, the device works well, I truly am looking forward to when Chromecast will be compatible with other apps.  Like Amazon Prime, DramaFever, Spotify, who knows.
B00AX6KMGS|2.0|&#34;The Faculty&#34; inched very close to 3 stars, but I just couldn't do it due to the fact that it simply isn't very good.  It tries very hard to be a kind of comedic &#34;Invasion of the Body Snatchers&#34; cover, but it really doesn't quite hack it.  It has some moments, I'll give it that, but it's really just not that interesting.  I easily targeted the &#34;mole&#34; which simply means that there was no real surprise at the end.  Speaking of which, the end was just a stupid mess.  Well, actually, the entire movie was a mess.  I doubt that I will ever want to waste my time seeing it again.  I'm just glad that Jon Stewart has a very successful career with his tv  show these days, because it sure wasn't in acting.  Sorry Jon.  Enough said.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Though it has very sad parts to it, the story was written with sympathy, understanding and even though it was an ugly time in history, there was great love friendship, together ship.  Hopefully those who read this book will understand how one man can use words to destroy human beings and twist our beliefs to  destroy our world.
B00FPTW1A8|4.0|Still a good clean cartoon for children and always a lesson to learn, this being the importance of family and friends.
B000VDDDVO|5.0|wow the color disk is awesome i can not tell it was not actually filmed in black and white ! very pleased with quality of color !
B008EKMB82|3.0|The leader of my book club chose this book because it was shortlisted for a Booker Prize.  I have read and loved many Pulitzer and Booker Prize-winning novels, but reading this book felt akin to sitting through an introductory college class on deconstructionism.  I felt while reading  it (and I only finished because I finish what I start) that I was witnessing a scholarly exercise--a very respectable but nonetheless sadly unmoving attempt at virtuosity by an accomplished writer.  The glossary and several appendices in the back, replete with explanations of quantum physics as well Japanese slang and cultural explanations, certainly contributed to this novel's self-conscious and &#34;intellectual&#34;  tone.  The book has all of the current issues---school bullying (and cyber-bullying), philosophy, physics, time travel, Zen Buddhism, environmentalism, nuclear meltdowns, multinational corporate exploitation, midlife crisis, depression,economic and suicide crises, sexual exploitation and prostitution, Alzheimer's disease, multiculturalism---all that and more, but I still don't care all that much about the characters.
B0035HKWLW|5.0|Classic Carey. My son is finally old enough to see it and he thought it was hysterical!<br />He was laughing and dancing
B001HBYHFA|4.0|arrived on time . exciting sci fi movie , lots of action and fast moving , I'm not going into<br />the plot you have to get it to see for yourself. The price was good. Enjoyed this.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I really l poo 've this app!!! Super addictive! I have had a few force closes but beside that I can't wait to see what else this game has in store for me.
B00F9F1G4U|1.0|constantly crashes on Kindle Fire HDX 8.9. The App will run for a few seconds. The speed test even begins. But the app eventually crashes, most of the time before the test finishes.
0804161380|5.0|Came packaged amazingly so that the collector box did not dent or anything.<br />I do not mind that the cloth maps were not in the books since I've heard that the quality for them were not that great.<br />The bookmark and certificate all make up for it, also the &#34;chest&#34; the items came in.<br />For $107, this is a bargain! The books separately are at least $30 each.<br />This is a perfect LoZ collectors item.
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|HexLogic is a great brain-bender on the advanced difficulty level.  The easier difficulty levels give you a very good introduction, and the higher difficulty levels require more abstract problem-solving and logical skills by providing less information to start with.  The &#34;Hot Air&#34; version features beautiful images of hot air balloons.
1616550414|5.0|I've been wanting this book for my LoZ collection for the longest time, now I have it!<br />It's very informative and well detailed.<br />I found it funny that the misprint in the Japanese version ended up being in the English one (the two OoT medallions)<br />The price was a bargain, too.<br />Only thing that made me a bit upset was that the binding edges were a bit dented when it came in, but I can always buy another one and keep it in the plastic.
B0059WTMLW|5.0|I have a couple Sudoku games for my Android, and both provide very helpful puzzle-solving aids, but this one beats the other in terms of usefulness and variety.  As a helpful feature, both programs let you &#34;pencil in&#34; multiple possible numbers in each square, but this one wins in that, when you select one of them as the right answer, it erases it from any other squares in that row/column/block automatically.  As for the variety, this game has eight different variants on the basic game.  I highly recommend it.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|This is perhaps one of the funniest comedies from years ago. You have people like John Cleese who is incredible. You can't go wrong with this series.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I really enjoyed this game; I found it quite addictive.  The main difference from Candy Crush Saga, which I haven't played but have watched my wife and kids play, is that the levels are timed but there is no limit on the number of moves.  There are three stars per level, and the time to complete determines how many you get.  I have completed all 74 levels, and have replayed them many, many times to get three stars on as many as possible.  I got a total of 212 out of 222 possible stars.  That should tell you that Playrix has gameplay figured out.  I admit to being a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to games; however, the number of stars you get doesn't affect anything, as far as I could tell.<br /><br />The game has a nominal storyline that follows the book; unfortunately, the dialog didn't work on my phone; there was no audio, and only about 5% of the subtitles were visible on my screen.  Also, at least once a day, when you start it, it nags you about their other games.  But the basic gameplay is excellent fun, and I highly recommend this game.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Kids liked it<br />Graphics are very good.  Needs a clear e r story line<br />Easy enough to follow. Loads of fun
B008Y212PI|5.0|Simple Pleasures has given me many hours of brain stimulation.  The background pictures are fun and pleasant, and the game's three difficulty levels provide a great variety of mental effort.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is the best!  It has everthing I can relate to! And the mood of the book changes through out the book! I love this book so much!
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Honestly, when it comes to puzzler apps, more frequently than not, I get annoyed and put it down well before I get anywhere. I don't have a ton of free time, so if it will be taken up staying at a screen and not getting anywhere, I conclude the app is not for me. This one is challenging enough to make me think, but not so challenging that I get annoyed. Very well done app, without the repetitive music or annoying sounds of many apps.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is awsome I play it alot it dose take time if u can't buy acorns or coins but I still love it
B0017MO10U|5.0|As a fan of the show I can't imagine anyone not liking this movie. It makes room for the entire cast, has time line paradoxes, action and shows when creative people get together quality entertainment can be made without breaking the bank.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|The lay out and game it's self is similar to candy crush saga . It's cute and easy to play .
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I have to admit this was much better than I was lead to believe.  The way the action starts right off is unusual for the genre, and they manage to keep the action going practically nonstop yet It doesn't get boring or repetitive.  I didn't read the book, so no comments in that regard.<br /><br />I was glued to it from start to finish, and I can get turned off easily. Give it a try. You may find it's better than you thought it would be too.
1451666179|5.0|The stories in this book are so funny, you will fall off your seat laughing! The story about depression was the most relate-able I have ever read. All around awesome!

B008QTV3X0|5.0|Homeland is the most intriguing television stories to be told in years. Its compelling plot keeps you interested from season to season. There is nothing else quite like it on TV.
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|all you can do is keep tapping on a page and see if something happens. no directions what so ever. uninstalled.
B00G5G7K7O|1.0|This is one of the worst movies of the entire season! The storyline was not well-thought out. Considering they shelved the project multiple times and only picked it up again after the success of Tangled, they should have shelved it again until they further thought out the storyline!<br /><br />Frozen’s singers don’t cut it. I don’t care how famous they are --- they were really bad in this! You literally struggle to hear them over the instruments that are playing during the songs they sing. During some songs, it sounds as if the singers sometimes practically give up on singing altogether and just shout. There’s a duet of the sisters in particular that I’m referring to (For The First Time in Forever (Reprise)). The animation and audio quality did not match the songs. This is most evident in the song Let It Go. The words don’t match the lip movement, and the audio sounds out of place.<br /><br />*****WARNING!!! SPOILERS*****<br />Due to Elsa’s inability to properly harness her powers, she nearly kills her little sister. The king and queen take both sisters to some wise trolls who heal the little girl and then warn the parents that the powers will grow. They tell them that if she doesn’t learn to control them, there will be grave consequences. The trolls then explain that fear will be her enemy. It can hinder her ability to cope with these powers. These wise and caring parents come to the brilliant conclusion that it’s a good idea to completely seclude the princess from everyone.<br /><br />Of course it never occurred to them that this might cause her to be more fearful than ever.. They even seal off the castle.<br /><br />Then they leave the two fearful, confused children on their own (with no precautionary measures in place to help the cursed princess should they perish) while they go on a little cruise… and drown.<br /><br />This absurdity continues with Elsa (the ice queen) accidentally revealing her powers in front of a foreign dignitary from asmall kingdom who then orders her soldiers to arrest their own queen. I mean, do I really need to explain how stupid that is?<br />The young princess then searches for her fleeing sister and leaves the kingdom in the charge of a young prince she has a crush on… rather than a trusted aid or prime minster or any other sort of government official.<br /><br />After a typical Disney “love conquers all” moment, the curse of eternal winter (the winter was inexplicably determined to be eternal after about one night) is lifted by the ice queen who before was unable to remove it. How? They don’t really explain. They merely have her exclaim, “Of course! Love!” That makes no sense of course because she always loved her kingdom and her sister. If love is the cure then it would have never happened in the first place. Whatever.<br /><br />Now my biggest complaint. The way women (and the ice queen in particular) were portrayed. There were only four women that had any prominence throughout the movie. Number one: the ice queen’s mother. Remember those really stupid parents I talked about earlier? She was one of them. And it was the father who did the talking, who spent the intimate moments with both the children, etc. She might as well not have been there.<br />There’s the troll mother who embarrasses her son and generally acts like a harebrain. Then there are the two sisters Anna the princess and Elsa the ice queen.<br />Anna is a ditz who falls in love with- and determines to marry- a guy she’s only known for a few hours. Elsa is a strong girl… who’s actually highly emotional and perpetually frightened like a mouse. But don’t worry. She later turns against the way she was raised and determines to stop being a good girl. She then proceeds to walk down the hall like a Victoria’s Secret model with a large slit in her dress deliberately placed to show as much leg as possible.<br />Nearly all other women shown are intentionally made to be fat and unattractive.So what can we gather from this? Women are mostly undesirable, and those that are desirable are only desirable for their bodies… or raising your kids. Do you remember Beauty and the Beast? I remember Belle for being brilliant, beautiful, and brave. But hey, Anna and Elsa are both beautiful. One out of three ain’t bad, eh? *face palm*<br /><br />The trolls were predictable and uninspired. The way the characters talked, in this, like, totally, like modern teen, like way, was like, yea…not cool.<br /><br />All in all, 1/5 stars. They should have shelved it until they had worked out their story more instead of releasing it prematurely to make a quick buck!

B00FAPF5U0|4.0|love playing this game but definitely think that later levels tease you to keep you addicted. addictive. wish each device was consistent but the differences are small
B00CATSONE|5.0|I really feel that this should be mandatory reading for those in high school or earlier.  I enjoyed this book and shall pass it along!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|After reading this moving story, I know how horrid it was to live through that time, how horrid to see your beloved friends and families taken away.
B00C2UUDMG|5.0|Michael Connelly has done it again. As usual his books are totally captivating and it's very hard not to just read the whole thing in one go. If you're a fan of Connelly's work this is a no-brainer purchase, if you enjoy a good courtroom drama with all the twists and turns that come with a murder mystery I think you'll enjoy this too.

B00B9PJ2OA|4.0|I purchased these boots looking for a practical and fashionable shoe that would compliment my active lifestyle and style of dress.  The boots are durably made with solid construction.  The design reflects an intelligent balance between functionality and progressive styling.  This is a shoe I can wear to the clubs and to the woods and feel equally comfortable in both environments.  The lace up design allows me to feel secure and versatile in mobility while the lined, cushioned interior insures that my feet feel supported.  This is an excellent shoe.
B0040I09RM|5.0|No tv drama series can ever come close to the riveting story of SAMCRO. The most effective treatment for a boring life.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|A must read - can't wait to see the movie. This book is pleasurable and sad at the same time. Gives insight into Nazi Germany and the lives of the poor and innocent and how the Jews were persecuted. Leisel takes us to the joys of reading. Odd being narrated by death but apt seeing that there was so much death then.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Sales is often given a negative connotation and Daniel Pink's book helps to clarify why we have to get out of that mindset. Artfully written it really breaks down the psychology of selling, why we think it's bad and how we can see the other point of view and use sales (in a good way) in our lives. We cannot escape it, so why not make it more meaningful. I really enjoyed the two part way it's written where the first part explains and the second gives clear actionable ways you can use the improved techniques in your life. I never thought I was in sales, but now I see how I need to use these techniques. Great book.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|An excellent follow up to The Shining. Stephen King has stayed true to his characters and universe. I loved his early and often callouts that Dick Halloran survived the Shining, clearly differentiating from the Kubrick film.
B00D2ZF3GQ|2.0|I was suprised at how bad this movie was considering will smith is a favorite actor of mine. It had an ok plot but the execution of it sucked, his son just doesn't have the presence to pull it off. It was poorly directed and boring, almost left half way thru the movie. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|But addictive, really addictive. If you have plans to do anything else in your life once you start playing candy crush - forget them.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Good calculator for basic math.  The % sign is included. This app was so much better than the app that came on my phone.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|I loved the action !!! Thor and Iron Man are the greatest !! Hope there is a sequel. Will definitely see it.
B0058VW36U|1.0|So, I got the game knowing it is fun, but IT WOULD NOT LOAD! I've tried re-downloading it five times, but it still would not load. If I were you and you only had enough money for this one game don't take your chances with this app.
B00BMNM4H6|4.0|The concept isn't complicated but it's simple to learn and difficult to master. Great little game for sitting in a doctor's office waiting or driving in a car (as a passenger, of course!). Even young children will get the concept and can use their imagination to work this one.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun of kids and adults. If you get board and need something to do its fun or even if you want to keep some one occupied its perfect.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This game is more challenging and more fun than I thought it would be. To solve it requires thinking outside of the box. It's a good exercise in looking for options, non-obvious solutions.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is just like playing in a real bingo hall. The is intense and very exciting real. Lots of entertainment, bingo and great slots.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|The Bared to you, Reflected to you and Entwined  in you have a much better story line than Fifty Shades of Grey, which I did enjoy but I really enjoyed ready these books and cant wait for the next book in the series to come out..
B00GX50BD2|3.0|For such an interesting man and time period, this movie was a disappointment. I don't think that it captures who Steve Jobs was. It makes the birth of personal computing boring. I do want to commend Ashton K, he did capture a lot of Jobs mannerisms.
0451191153|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. I read it because I received good comments about it.... I must say ayn rand has written better books...
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|As impactful as Orwell's 1984. Makes one want to revisit views of privacy, social media and the web. Read it next.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just saw Catching Fire last night and ever since I have wanted to read the last book of Mockingjay because I can finally visualize it better seeing the new additional characters that also play a part in the final book, every time I read this book all I can think about is how I wish Suzanne would make another book that talks more about Peeta and Katniss' life together and whenever I read the Epilogue I just want to read more and more until the book is over then I want to see the movies and read all the books I honestly can't wait for Mockingjay to come out and once the second part of it does I will definitely be getting all of those movies and watching them over and over. Not even kidding when I say that the books and the movies are absolutely phenomenal.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Having been a dedicated player on Facebook, I was super excited when I found out the game was compatible with my kindle fire. It is unique and different from the same game on Facebook but it still keeps with the heart of what Castleville is. Very enjoyable.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|The movie Miracle on 34th Street is one of my favorite Christmas movies.  I was able to get it for a small amount of money.
B00DMKFN34|5.0|My 3 year old son will NOT stop watching this!! We have been watching it on our new 3D tv we purchased.  It was extremely clear on the 2D as well, but totally AMAZING on 3D!  A must have!!
B000ID37RM|5.0|Innocence meets reality....great movie and tonight (11/29/13) was the first time I've watched it and haven't yet read the book.  A must see for any generation!
B00FEN000S|5.0|Loved this movie, saw it twice in the movie theater.  while it doesn't have the visual impact of the theater, it is a great fun movie in the style of the movies i grew up watching on saturday afternoon.  The bonus features included with the digital version are an added plus.  and Charlie's not that hard to look at.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|i am not sure why my fiance downloaded this onto my kindle, we have 2 computers, 2 smart phones, and a tablet. She has FB on all of them. I have no idea why she needs google on my kindle or FB on the kindle. But it works.
B00FPGV3RS|3.0|interesting story, good actors, but it doesn't really come together.  I was looking for a fun movie for a cold night and thought i would give this one a try.  The movie started well but veered off in to unnecessary grossness, really!? Why can't you just tell a good story?  loved the actors and the side stories were very good.<br />The plot was a clever twist (although predictable) on a story we have seen before.
B00ENTDDGW|2.0|don't waste your time playing this game. you'd be better off watching video clips of cats sleeping to waste your time.
B004LM72ZY|5.0|This was a gift but we were told it was a big hit. Good quality like the other playmobil products.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love the game, the different themes makes it fun to play. I think that getting the keys in the box and along the tracks more often would be nice too!
B003KVKQB4|5.0|If you want to understand why your wages and benefits are stagnant, why your leaders' reasons make no sense, and why there is perpetual war and terrorism worldwide, then you need to read this book. It is a history of the world seen through the eyes of Generation X.
B00G70JQZC|4.0|Great continuation of the Wolverine story, good special effects and characters. Hugh Jackman and the rest of the cast were perfect for their roles.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|I have two AppleTVs and was looking for a lower cost option for the guest bedroom. I realized before purchasing the Chromecast that it was very basic and does not do most of what the AppleTV does.  However, I did want to be able to watch Web videos in the guest room and hotels when traveling and the Chromecast seemed perfect for the price.  For $35, it's not a bad tool to have, but I'd hate to reply on it. First of all, the setup was flaky and took multiple attempts to connect to our home network (not the automatic, quick setup as with an AppleTV).  Second, it does drop the signal every once and a while and the programming has to be restarted.  Third, every time you turn on the TV, it takes a while to re-establish a connection with the serving device.  Fourth, it works with very few hotel networks due to privacy settings built into public wifi networks.  So, it's definitely not a good option for travel. Fifth, it does NOT work with Chrome as Google claims!  It only works with the desktop version of Chrome that has a special extension installed.  Sixth, the quality of video is poor when viewed through Netflix and Hulu plus, yet when those same Apps stream via Airplay to an AppleTV, they are high quality. Finally, being a Google product, few iOS Apps use Chromecast. Perhaps owners of Android OS devices may find more functionality.<br /><br />It's not bad for a pinch, but it's performance is definitely in the $35 dollar range.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is such a great app. The only thing I would change about it is to either a) have a way to get tons of tokens without buying them, or b) have more thing to buy with bananas. Otherwise, It is a.awesome app
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Good graphics. kept me entertained for hours. Love this series. Bought almost every hungry shark game and liked every one.
0792163710|5.0|When someone says “they don’t make them like this anymore”, you can say the same about the old fashion American Western.  One of my favorite Westerns is the 1953 film adaptation of Shane.<br /><br /> The setting takes place in the valley territory of Wyoming sometime after the Homestead Act of 1862.  This was the classic Wild West where cattlemen needed territory for their herds and people who were looking for a new beginning were settling into this territory starting new lives.  Hence the friction, and out west the law was usually settled with whoever handled a gun the best.<br /><br /> In this fantastic depiction of life in the Wild West, we have outstanding actors who bring forth a true Western Classic.  Alan Ladd is our loner hero with a mysterious past who enters into town and stays for a while as a farm hand with a family who are settling on a farm.  The actors depicting this family are Jean Arthur as the frontier wife, Van Heflin as the husband and Brandon deWilde (of Jamie TV fame) as the ever present son and admirer of Shane.<br /><br /> In this depiction as so common of straight forward Westerns of the time pairs the good against the bad.  Quite literally the white cowboy hats against the black cowboy hats.  In this case it’s the cattlemen against the settlers and Shane who begins as not wearing a gun later goes into town wearing a gun due to the ever rising battles between the good and the bad.<br /><br /> What makes this movie so great is that it contains a simple plot with a shy and mysterious hero looking to avoid trouble but as so often happens trouble finds him.  Alas, the great showdown.  So while I’ve mentioned the good guys we have one of the greatest bad man and veteran of countless Westerns in the actor of Jack Palance.<br /><br /> For those who have never seen this classic, this movie is a must see.  It is beautifully filmed in Wyoming in color.  I first saw this movie as a young boy of six years of age and it made quite an impression on me.  And from time to time I will revisit the time when they really knew how to make a Western and instead of seeing it in a theater I watch on a streaming feed from Amazon.on me.

B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Easy read, plot lines predictable. Enjoy a relaxing book with characters that are familiar, fun and lovable.  Ending needed to wrap up the other players in the book
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Overall I'm actually QUITE IMPRESSED,especially for the cost. The options are just a bit disappointing for the lack of them. For Netflix, Google Play & (I guess) Hulu it works quite well.
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|I'm one of those tried and true Preston-Child fans.  I've been reading their co-authored books since Relic was published in the mid-90's.  I absolutely love the Pendergast series and I think Agent Pendergast is one of the absolute best detective characters who has ever been created in popular fiction.<br /><br />Be that as it may, this was not a good book.  I don't know what happened to the boys on this one, but they struck out big time.  &#34;Jumped the shark&#34; is the only phrase I can think of to describe this book.  Pendergast discovers he had a son he didn't know about, and...wait for it!....the boy has an EVIL TWIN.  In fact, they grew up in a secret Nazi enclave in South America where the Nazis were carrying out nefarious eugenics experiments on twins, creating a population of slave labor (the &#34;regular&#34; twins) and a population of super smart evil geniuses (the &#34;enhanced&#34; twins).<br /><br />The whole thing was just ridiculous and banal, totally unoriginal and over-the-top in the extreme.  My sincere hope is that this is just a blip on the radar and they will get back to normal in their next Pendergast novel.
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|There are no instructions or help for this game.  How am I supposed to know what I'm doing???  I can get to the second screen.  But beyond that, I have no clue what I'm supposed to do or how to solve any of the puzzles.  It's frustrating and a waste of time...unless you're psychic and are able to read the developer's mind.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|It has very nice graphics and kept me entertained for hours. It is also free which makes it that much better. I mostly bought the game to play in front of the friends that love all living creatures and can't stand the thought of them being hurt but it turned out to be so much more.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I love the Avengers, all of them. And being able to watch the action in Blu Ray is just over the top. The friction among the individual &#34;heroes&#34; is so typical of personalities who are each used to being in the spotlight and has strong ideas of how problems should be solved.  Their ultimate choice to pull together is a lesson that I would like to see resonate in some other quarters!
B0050PYNN0|4.0|Those who are repelled by foul language would do well to avoid this one. Strip that element away, if you can, and what is left is a decent sort of Abbott and Costello, Martin and Lewis, type of movie. Mostly low comedy, some of it funny, and an occasional  'against type' action which is funny. I refer the reader to the editorial and many  other comments for the gist of the film. My over-all response is that for those in the target audience this will be pretty funny; for those who prefer more straight-arrow entertainment, this is likely to be an irritating dud.,
0060581808|5.0|This classic reminds us of what it took to really establish this country. I think every little girl in the United States should read the &#34;Little House&#34; series, because it shows what life was like for little girls back then as well as the personality traits that made them grow into women of respect and admiration. This book is entertaining but so very educational to modern children.
0062107313|5.0|An awesome read with great details of history for the time and place in which the story takes place.  Loved every moment and dreaded the end for it would be done.  Ms. Tan truly carried me away to another time and place with rich characters!!!
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|I believe the Dark Knight trilogy will become the classics of Batman movies. This, the 1st installment, of course has the Joker as never before seen, and will never be again. It is not for the fainthearted; this is no cartoon. This is a fully grown, evil personified Joker fighting a Batman who is no longer sure of his place in the world. It's one of those movies that we will watch over and over.
0316010669|5.0|This book contains good insight into the way we think without knowing we are thinking that way. It is a perspective-changing work that I reccommend to everyone.
B00008WT5M|5.0|Ever since my college days I love ACDC! I still do! This CD did not disappoint at all. Rock on!
B002OKO1GI|5.0|A great series and lots of life lessons included, wholesome enjoyable and safe entertainment for families to share. Especially good with dog lovers which includes  our whole family.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive and fun! I really like all of the creative levels and the graphics are amazing! It's a good thing I only have so many lives, or I would be playing far too often for far too long! :D
B00ECL7ZJ2|5.0|I CAUGHT HAIM ON LETTERMAN AND WAS IMPRESSED ENOUGH TO GET UP AND MAKE A NOTE. AFTER SNL, I CALLED PEOPLE AND RAVED, AND I'M STILL RAVING. I HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED A BAND SO RIGHTFULLY CONFIDENT, SO FUN, SO TIGHT, SUCH REAL MUSICIANS EMBODYING WHAT MUSIC IS ALL ABOUT SINCE - WAIT FOR IT - THE BEATLES, A NIFTY COMBO I HAPPENED ON IN L.A.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|This game is very well designed and the actual moving of the lines is smoother than the other two games (Flow and Flow Bridges). Although this is developed by a different company. The levels are pretty basic/easy if you have played the other versions. I also read a review about flashing lights. They do not bother me and if you are used to playing games, they won't bother you either. I got this game for free so I do not recommend paying for it. If you want a game like this go buy Flow Free or Flow Bridges. Do not waste money on this.
0061992860|5.0|Cool little book. It's small so it's great to throw in a pack and always have with you. The info is accurate and informing. It's just a good book to have if you camp a lot or just want to be educated in survival. Love my little SAS book, and now my husband wants one. ;)
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|After reading the book, seeing this movie was somewhat disappointing. It just doesn't &#34;catch&#34; you. Maybe I had a lot of expectations after reading and liking the book, and it was not on the screen as I imagined it.
B00BATG18K|5.0|I just finished the book on kindle. I have been reading it for four days, including Thanksgiving.  It was hard to put down,Amy Tan is such a woonderful author. Ive read other books of hers but this one is the best!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm happy it's finally on Amazon for Kindle, but disappointed that I haven't been able to sync it from my Kindle Fire with Facebook. Any suggestions???
B008K8VDPU|5.0|aloha everyone...hope y`all had a joyful..memory filled..and belly stuffed kind of a thanksgiving weekend. x x well...thought i'd pick-up a piano app for my granddaughter..who just turned seven. hoped to surprise her on her next visit w/a new app in her kindle file. ha! ha! so much for that hoped plan. this app will be going into my file instead.

B00061QK02|5.0|A classic movie that will never get old. I can not wait for the new Anchorman to release soon this year.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I enjoy every minute and all challenges of this game. I highly recommend it to all and good job to the developers!!
B00ADQPB50|5.0|It is unbelievable how well-acted and written this series is!!!!!!!!!!!!! Just bravo, bravo, bravo to Jessica Lange and all the other actors!!!!! Each actor is just phenomenal!!! No wonder they won the Emmys and continue to win them!!!! It is so much fun because I've watched all the seasons, to see the same actors play completely different parts so well!!!!! Bravo, bravo, bravo to all!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love playing Candy Crust as it helps one unwind after work. Love the colors and all the stick figure graphics on each level.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I choose this rating because it is awesome  to have a on the go dictionary that be use by both children and adults. What i like was that it gives you multiple examples so you really understand what the word means .I recommend to mostly teens because lots of teachers have their students look up words and this is a fast and easy way.
B008AIGWVA|5.0|Well my sister and I love it and I think it's awesome and you should totally buy it right now on the spot no questions asked
B005Q1W10A|5.0|AWESOME!!! I love this show and it is as amazing as season 1 was.  Highly recommend any Downton Abbey fan own this!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I love this app. The graphics are great and it's so easy to switch from one town to the next when planning trips out of town.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Have to skip through an ad before every game. Enjoy playing once past this annoyance.  It has good customization options.  Actual game play is very enjoyable.  May uninstall due to ads.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game was and still always has a great play through and I always felt a good challenge and it was very calming.
B00FAI2IUM|3.0|The cars are awesome and I love the graphics.I'm a speed demon.I'm only10 and thanks to the upgrades I Beat teenagers or whatever.The creator did a great  job on the game .I downloaded this free app on kindle fire.( Not HD).Just regular tablet.I how you like the game as much as me . If you see a red car look for rockin out its me!You have a helper to talk to you during the race just like Nascar racing. Sorry I got off topic from my last sentence.a Just in case you wanna pay for the game it's kinda worth it.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|This classic work is enchanting and enthralling. Far from boring, it paints a vivid picture of a different era, and it brings the era to life with complex, memorable characters that the reader grows to know. The only bad point is that I'm always left wanting to know more of their lives! A classic that never loses its charm - read it!
B00785P2QC|4.0|Good game to play nice levels and opportunities. I love how you earn cash dollars easy unlike some games you really don't get a chance to earn money or diamonds.
B007N8RULO|5.0|The game is fun, easy, and nice to waste time on. It runs smoothly and is ready to restart, start a new game, or undo a move. I like that it keeps track of personal bests.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|It is amazing sure the loading speed is slow but it is all about the game play and this game
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this app. I love the different alarm settings, color options, sound options, and editing options. I love how easy it is to turn off an alarm with out having to delete it. The disable options are awesome and a little bit of everything for different tastes. The different snooze options are very helpful too and nice to change based on the alarm purpose. The option to name the alarms is also truly fantastic. I've never had a problem that wasn't just user error.
1594746168|2.0|More of just a picture book, a bit boring with very little meat on the bone verbiage wise - would not recommend  :(
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I love this app. I have it on my cell phone and my kindle fire. It is so easy to make new notes, lists, edit, choose colors, password protect, and even pin to the home screen an individual note (phones and tablets only.)<br />I recommend this app to everyone I know because it is so nice to use. I also love that once you are done with a note it is easy to delete so they don't stack up.
B00594XOZU|2.0|I love this app it's great but there's a problem with letting me sign in and create an account. I am really sad that they made it unavailable because this app I use for a lot of reasons and now I can't download it. Please fix ASAP!!!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Was a very good book!!!! Was sad the way people would treat another person !!!!! John Gresham has done it again made me think of how hard life is and the truth will come out in the end!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wish it had a few more ways to get past some of the levels, but really love the game! Can't stop playing!
B00DF0POXA|1.0|his worst album to date, guess kim k. had some input in this CD and it show he has lost his creative force
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|Good app to use.. it is the best app to use for making videos and taking pictures I would recommend this app for people who are good at taking pictures or for good pictures to post on social networks
B007GCY8FS|5.0|The story within the story makes for one you can't put down!  Five stars for the suspense and excellent pacing.
B00FI7XBIS|5.0|Wasn't sure I'd like this. But now I'm hooked! May need to remove it from my Kindle for a while before I go overboard!
0920668372|5.0|This is an amazing book. This book brings me to tears. This book has such a meaningful message, there's no greater love than a mother's love. No matter the age, mother's love does not fade for her child. Wonderful book that everyone should read and own!
B00CE03UOC|3.0|Another typical (fun) flow game, with cool neon colors effects, but:<br /><br />- Nags you (try other games, rate, etc.)<br />- Some level packs must be purchased
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is awesome because you get to go all around the world like pairs or china it awsome
B00AZRBLHO|4.0|Does a great job of putting theories or practice into a practical context.  Didn't get 5 stars because I felt the tale could have been a little shorter with just as much punch.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Such a great app for young and old, a lot of fun and a good past time... really enjoying it, thank you to the makers, a five star game
B003YBNRHU|4.0|product as described unlike the same title I purchased before this one from another vendor that didnt work the first time I played it.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|I am just loving this series.  The visuals and the characters spring to life on the pages.  A great and addictive read.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|This book was so awesome I read it from front to back non-stop. Way to go Stephen King! The follow up was brilliant. A must read if you like the Shining.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|I love real steel it is the best game ever they should get other people to play it around the whole world
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|History of The Eagles is a must own for any Eagles fan. Great behind the scenes footage and amazingly honest interviews. Henley and Frey come across pompous at times, but their recollections were amazing. It was very bold of the band to include Leadon, Meisner, and Felder also.
0443069522|5.0|It's a wonderful text book to start studying for the USMLE. I'm an abroad student and I cannot me more happy with my book.
B008D19WBQ|4.0|I like it but the sound is very low on it. I have to turn my new tv up really loud to hear it.  Other than that, its great!
B008JFURKG|4.0|A Film that just wants to have fun with it self and it does, with really fun characters,action and a simple plot and story
B0063IH60K|4.0|I really enjoy this version. The graphics are simple and easy to view. The game is fast enough, and I like the way it plays on my Kindle. I find the ads a bit annoying. I have to deal with an ad each time I start a new game. Yuck.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Cute game, like the different hidden object scenes... I have been having issues with this company's games. This is the third one I have gotten. I WIIL be cruising along solve one area then BAM! The game shuts off and I have start over from the area I just solved. I hope this company can fix this issue, not had that problem with any others on my Kindle Fire
B00EMAGCJM|5.0|This Cd is edited so i went with the Deluxe copy I LOVE HER MUSIC!!!!!!!! Miley is such a talented singer OMG!
B00DVKOYBM|4.0|Very good game. It has good clarity, and a good clear picture. Just wish it had a chat line. Up grade it.
B007FIY3VW|5.0|this is a very good resource for everyone ..if you have homework no access to a computer this is it.. Even for adults assignment for work go for it
B00CRS88IO|2.0|Could have been a good book but far too many jarring incongruities.  Just as I would be getting interested in what was happening Stevenson would throw out some idiotic piece of information that showed he has no clue what he's talking about.<br /><br />Some glaring examples from the first half, there are many others I left out.  Others have pointed out some of the other glaring errors:<br /><br />Fleming is issued a Colt M1911 (which coincidentally was introduced in 1911, also he would have been issued a M1911A1) The expert armorer says he's been given it by the yanks to try out and he'd like a report on it's performance.  By 1940 it was already a very well established and successful gun used by both American and the British military and had been since before WWI.  Also it's stainless, odd since S&W was the first gunmaker to introduce a stainless steel gun, in 1965 (the model 60).  Colt didn't start making stainless steel 1911A1 pistols until 1985.<br /><br />One of the German officers has a female Russian aide and she is dressed in a \\"clingy black latex uniform.\\"  Nice fetish imagery, but completely out of place in WWII.<br /><br />Also the same German officer rides around in an airship which has engines that \\"caused fire to belch out in huge plumes.\\"  I guess those silly Germans didn't learn anything from the Hindenburg in '37.<br /><br />Fleming, who in the book smokes 44 cigarettes in a night can apparently also run 50 miles over rough terrain, without getting lost using only a map printed on a single playing card, at night, in about an hour without any real effort or even being winded.  The best record today for a 50 mile race, on a smooth road, is just a few minutes under 5 hours for a top athlete who trains for ultramarathons.<br /><br />That was the point after which I couldn't bring myself to continue reading.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|My 5 year old LOVES this movie! It's a wonderful Christmas movie we've added to our collection and will pull out every year at Christmas time.
B005G5PPGS|3.0|good read<br />really explain the inside part of baseball.likes how the a change everything. thought it wasn't like the movie in the beginning but ended the same way as the movie
B00E9A656K|5.0|great game and has potential for a sequel. just challenging enough to. keep u playing but not to frustrate you. 5 stars for sure!
B008MIMWOO|2.0|It was supposed to be a three disc set, I only received the third movie, Goldmember, I hope we can get this resolved..
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Quick download and install to my kindle fire hd. DOES NOT WORK. Gives a failure message about not being able to reach server. If I access from web Facebook.com works ok. Something's wrong with this app. Have removed and downloaded to try to correct. No success. Tried help and that doesn't exist.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|aswomedespicable-meaning,it's awesome and despicible or the best game ever!!!!!!!! ( it is the best game ever)I cant beleave how good it is.
0786958731|4.0|Best of the 3 D&D Board Games overall, though if you know the other games you're not going to be blown away.  It just adds some different tile features, has some mildly improved art additions, more diverse scenarios and play options, and more powerful heroes.  The true value of this game is for fans of the books - playing as the Companions of the Hall beats anonymous heroes in most cases.  Good value for the amount of game you get and the quality and quantity of the components, and the D&D series offers a game system that makes it easy to create your own scenarios.  Also a great challenge for miniature painters with 42 unpainted minis!
B007QA3AH2|5.0|This is just one of those movies that you can watch over and over, and laugh at the same jokes every time, even though you know that they are coming. My husband and I just watched last night for probably the 20th time. Wish they would make a sequel. Love every character. Fun to see Justin Long as a kid. If you love shows like Star Trek, you will appreciate the humor.
B00G4I11YQ|4.0|Informative documentary but not really as in depth as I had hoped.  Seemed to contain redundant footage to extend the film without any real investigative fact presentation.
0142429112|2.0|When this book first started out, I thought it might be a contender for a five star rating. It’s beginning is fabulous – sucked me in and left me hungry for more. But as I pressed on, I encountered some things I didn’t like.<br /><br />Firstly, and most significantly, the whole romance between Matthew and Diana is outrageous. He breaks into her apartment, stalks her, and just generally acts like a total creep. Then, when other people start doing the same thing, he gets incredibly protective. Diana gets scared and decides her number one stalker is the only person who can keep her safe from the lesser stalkers. Makes sense, right?<br /><br />Furthermore, Matthew is this misogynistic control freak who orders Diana around. I actually think it was a really good idea to make his character this way, because if a man had been living for hundreds of year, it’s very realistic that he would think it his place to boss women around. What I don’t like is that Diana barely resists him, and yet the other characters in the story refer to Diana as brave and stubborn and independent and headstrong. She’s not, and if she was, she would not fall for a man who tries so completely to control her, but she does. So in summary, I find their romance aggravating and unrealistic within the context of the story, and since this romance is such a central plot point in the novel, this poses a big problem.<br /><br />The other things I don’t like are much more minor: the author occasionally goes on these historian wet dream tangents, where she muses about how amazing it is that the vampire has seen the rise and fall of empires and met so many famous people throughout history (it’s cool to think about the first time, but she keeps bringing it up beyond the point where it’s cool); she spends too much time describing the way food tastes and the way characters smell (but a typical mistake for a first-time novelist, and not a terribly egregious one either); and she spends almost the entire book in Diana’s head but occasionally decides to jump into Matthew’s head (it seems in vogue nowadays to not write from a single character’s point of view, so I suspect the author was just following the trend, but in this particular case I think the book would have read better if we just stayed in Diana’s point of view).<br /><br />Now, as for the things I do like? First of all, I love the premise of the story. Most of the supernatural books/TV shows/movies that I’m familiar with focus on action and romance, and don’t have much of an intellectual bent to them. I love the idea of having creatures who aren’t just focusing on hiding their powers and falling in love, but are actually curious about where they come from and why they exist, and are doing research to figure it out.<br /><br />I also think it’s cool that the author included demons. For as many books as people write involving witches or vampires, there aren’t many out there that involve demons. And the way a witch’s power varies depending on her genetic markers is also a cool twist.<br /><br />I think I would really enjoy this story if it weren’t for the romance between Matthew and Diana.

0920236162|5.0|Came in great condition and it is a cute story.  I am a teacher and I used it for a lesson on how to compare and contrast characters (Cinderella vs. The Paper Bag Princess)
B00B2JSRAS|3.0|It's just not what I expected this book to be , maybe expecting too much .<br />Anyways will be finishing it soon and then loan out to others .
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it love it love it love it<br />This game is very addictive.<br />I can't wait to complete the daily challenges
0064431789|5.0|supper cute book, a classic and must have on any kids book shelf. Good bed time read too, not to long and has a cute ending. love this book!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The ultimate people connector.  I like catching up with old friends who live far away.  It's also interesting to see who is completely crazy and who's life is totally bananas.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This little device is wonderful.  Just got it for a trip and used it for a GPS and Iphone.  Both stayed charged and worked well.  WIll purchase more for other cars.
B00FWLDHSY|1.0|Boo.  Dumb story with bad FX.  The original Godzilla films of the 60's were better.  If they lip synced english and had more karate and long lens snap zooms I would have liked it more.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love this game because you get to be all the hero's you want to be and beat the villains.
B004T0E2S8|5.0|It has a lot of great songs and the Pro features are very useful.  Plus it has a bucnh of useful guitar tools.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I thought that this game wouldn't be fun but I was wrong really good for little kids also. only downside is that you have to be on the game for the tasks to work.
0316247545|5.0|I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 10 year old. She loves to read and is a huge MLP fan. This book is small but it is full of beautiful illustrations and stories about characters, places and how friendship is magic began. It's a sturdy hardcover book that will last a long time and will most likely become a collector item. This book is a must for MLP fans.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Just a wonderful story.  It had such a well written story with complex, interesting characters. I just didn't want to stop reading this book.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Amazon had the best price out there for this DVD and blu-ray pack. I really don't bother with the ultra violet. This is a great movie for anyone that is a fan of action movies or superman movies.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I really enjoyed the book. I couldn't put it down. Twist and turns until the end! A must read book.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|it wasn't one of his better story lines. I enjoyed &#34; a time to kill&#34; better that is why I bought the book because it had the same characters in it
B0024FAR5M|5.0|I wasn't sure if I would like a story about a motorcycle club but this series goes beyond just the action it tells the story Jax, the son of the man who founded the club right after the Vietnam<br />War.  Jax's father had an ideal about marching to his own drum as did the 8 others members of the original Sons of Anachry Club but unfortunately John Teller (Jax's father) did not live to see<br />his ideal happen.  It does contain very graphic violence but the message of brotherhood remains. I am hooked and already have seen season 2 and 3 which were even more exciting.  There are 5 seasons on DVD and the 6th is appearing on FX now.  Charlie Hunnan (sp?) and the rest of this excellent cast do a great job.  I woudn't recommend the show for anyone under the age of 17 but for adults it's well worth watching.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Brief summary/review spoiler free<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen is a sixteen year old girl living in the Seams, the poor end of district 12. Her father died in a mine accident when she was 11, so every day she goes out with her friend Gale, hunting in the woods. This is illegal, but no one cares because even the peacekeepers (basically cops) are hungry for meat. But when she enters the hunger games, what will happen to the sixteen year old rebel in the brutal tv death fight? Nobody wants to go in, but Katniss is itching to get out and get revenge against the brutal capital.<br /><br />Very well written, and even though I am not eligible to compete in the games, and have been  reading and rereading since last year. Currently trying to find the $5 to pay for the book
B005LLSZNM|5.0|I'm just a die-hard Sons of Anarchy Motorcycle Club Redwood Original kinda fan. What else can I say? (Bring on Season 8 Kurt!)
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Man, I wish I had a copy of that book. Little too much cussing, but I spent the whole day and some of yesterday reading it and blew half my battery on it. If I had a real-book copy, it would be as worn down as that zork house by the end of the month. The section about Zork was particularly enjoyable, as I am familiar with it. The writing wasn't as good as it could be, but I overly enjoyed reading it. Good to finish something I like today, as frosted (new disney princess movie) was the worst movie i've seen since happy feet 2. The 80's references were fun, even though I was born way  after 1980. Pac-man, back to the future, monty python, zork, and such.<br /><br />***Spoiler ahead, read at your own risk***<br /><br />I was actually half expecting them to push the button at the end, but they didn't.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I was at this concert, this DVD (and a good surround sound) brings this to life - almost as good as being there.
0385537131|5.0|J. Grisham knows the true South and its people.A great sequel to A Time To Kill. A real page turner.
B00CKJTVHW|5.0|&#34;Best Season Yet&#34; - all of the previous seasons are so great, yet they were all leading up to this! Great season, epic.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughters love this game. They ask to play it all the time. The games help with spacial reasoning, money management, and hand-eye coordination.
B00FLDG42Y|5.0|A year before my 50th Birthday, my wife of 32 years said to me... &#34;You'd better see these boys before it's too late&#34; and handed me a &#34;pass&#34; to see Rush live in Las Vegas, 2012-11-23.  Since 1980 at the tender age of 16 I dreamed of Rush touring to New Zealand or at least Australia. So to be finally be in a position to afford to fly over 6800 miles to see them live last year, was a long time dream come true.  I was really excited with the Clockwork Angels release and it was an opportunity I will always be grateful for. I flew out on 21-11-12 (what a magic Rush type date to fly out) and this latest Rush Live DVD / Blu Ray / CD was largely recorded a few days after the Las Vegas gig and is pretty much as I remember it and it is beautifully captured on both CD and Blu Ray (These are the two formats I purchased last week).  The set list, playing, Live production of both audio and visual is stunning.  Alex (Gtr), Geddy (Bass, Keys, Vocals) and Neil (Drums) really give a fantastic performance, as do the String section that accompanied them on this tour .  I love Clockwork Angels so was really pleased they played the bulk of that plus they dusted off some stuff that hasn't appeared on an official live release before (Grand Designs, Territories, Middletown Dreams from &#34;Power Windows&#34; (1985), Body Electric from &#34;Grace Under Pressure&#34; (1984) and Where's my thing from &#34;Roll the bones&#34; (1991). (Note the extra tracks at the end of the main concert are those that were not played at the Dallas show, but played at the Phoenix show as they alternated a few tracks each night they played.  So to have these tracks plus the Clockwork Angels suite meant a lot of stuff I hadn't heard live before, together with classics such as Tom Sawyer, Spirit of Radio, YYZ, Subdivisions, 2112 (Parts I, II and VII) and other incredible versions of songs such as Analog Kid, Where's my thing etc.  I can't speak highly enough of this release, it captures my memories very well. I've always felt bands have three great albums in them... The first normally in their youth full of energy and passion, the second touring a classic album and the third a celebration of time (eg 30 years). In this case Rush have had 1.&#34;All the words a Stage&#34; from 1976, 2.&#34;Exit... Stage Left&#34; from 1981 and 3.&#34;R30&#34; from 2004.  In Rush's case I believe they have had two others... 4. &#34;Rush in Rio&#34; from 2002, recorded 5 years after Neil had returned and the band got back together following the loss of his wife and daughter. The 5th entry for Rush is this latest effort, touring on the back of their classic Clockwork Angels album, one of their top 5 albums in their 20 album and coming up to 40 year career.  If you like Rush and / or great rock music and decide to get this I hope you like it as much as I do, highly recommended... 5 Big Stars for 3 great guys.
B00005JKLZ|5.0|Love this movie.  The special effects were just superb and a masterful improvement upon the original.  Great story and great movie.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|Best app for VNC and RDP. Has all the features you would expect in a remote desktop app including SSH tunneling.
B0000VCZK2|5.0|Classic quad of movies and just when you think they make one sequel too many, you make Alien Resurrection and it is AWESOME!!  Sigourney Weaver maintains an amazing character in these movies.  The best part is how she becomes emotilaly void and harder as the sequels continue.  Great job on these movies.
B005P1YCNK|5.0|This book is truly a life changer.  Read it once, read it again.  Buy it as a gift for your friends and family.  It opens your eyes!
B004LWZW4M|5.0|Awesome move!!!  If you haven't seen it, see it.  What a great way to improve the Planet of the Apes franchise.  I loved the way they explained the take of the apes, but also put a little bit of the old story line in the back ground of this production.
0553062182|5.0|Yes, we're out there!  Sometimes we have labels and sometimes we don't.  This book confirms that there are those who are highly sensitive, much more so than normal people.  It does not mean that we are not normal, just human.  Life is harder for us.  People need to know this - about themselves and about others.
B002ZG98UA|3.0|I saw this movie before, when it was Resident Evil 1, 2, or 3.  Please take this story in a different direct or stop making sequels.  Alice can only kick so much booty and still be believable.
B00CU0UE0E|5.0|The production, songs, vocals, and instrumentation on this album are fabulous! The songs are very well written and the performances by Capital Cities are among the best of new pop and rock trendsetters for 2012 and beyond. This album is excellent in every sense of the word! Wonderful!!!
B0034G4ORC|4.0|Good movie, I really enjoyed the apocalyptic nature of this movie as well as the believable characters.  It had the right amount of special effects without taking away from the story.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Imagine Dragons rock! These songs are all classics and are performed with plenty of professionalism combined with terrific compassion and understanding. This group will help define the music of this generation. The are supurb in every sense of the word. Great, guys!!!
B004Z7AHZC|5.0|This is a fun movie, even as an adult, it just tickles me.  I like that i can show it to my youngsters too.  Of the three released on DVD, this one is my least favorite.
B009EANE3M|5.0|Each of the songs on this album could be a chart hit in its own right. The vocals and the overall production cannot be surpassed. The songs musically and lyrically could not be better. This group is an absolute trendsetter for this year and for many years ahead. This album is excellent on every level. It is a must have for any rock and pop enthusiast.
0780622650|4.0|I liked the story line, but after a while the two youngest actors started to get annoying.  I know, they are supposed to be a real family with typical problems, but do the youngest ones have to be such whiney brats?  The adults, young and older, in the film were great.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great book,  I finished it while traveling to/from San Juan.  Highly Recommend, love the characters and the story line. What a great surprise at the end.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game and I was so happy when the app became available for the kindle.  I can play wherever without my laptop.
B008133MDK|5.0|Awesome story line & cast. Awesome story line & cast! Could not be better as a modern adaption.<br /><br />Amazon requires three more words to post. I don't know why?  Sort of a moronic requirement.<br /><br />Still the show is brilliant!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Great app. No problems so far except being able to connect with FB to unlock the next episode. No freezing either.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A great dystopian future story! Big brother is watching and big brother is making you watch too, so stay in line.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This app is very fun except it is really slow on the kindle. I wish it didn't lag so much
B001O6W9QC|5.0|Riotously funny. Completely irreverent. Wonderfully stupid. One to watch over and over with the guys (and the gals who can stomach it) in the man-cave.
B00CE03UOC|1.0|My wife loves some of their other apps &amp; since this was the FAOTD, I thought I'd give it a try. I played through 10 levels.<br /><br />Even though this is the paid version, it contains Admob. That's-1*.<br />It flashes the screen every time you connect the dots. There's another -1*.<br />I got a popup to buy another game. That's another -1*.<br />It was unresponsive a few times. Another -1*.<br />It's the full paid app, but wants to sell me more packs of levels. Another -1*.<br />It wants me to connect to Facebook so it can spam my friends. Another -1*.<br /><br />Since we're now less than the 1* required for reviews. I'll stop reviewing &amp; uninstall.
140006922X|5.0|Really enjoyed this. If you're interested in the reality, the History of the time period in which Jesus lived, and a following real-world protection of what he likely believed and meant, this is a very good read. Easy to digest, I found it a page-turner. Disappointed when I ran out of book.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|When an animal gets shot it looks almost real<br />The guns are great and animation rocks like the deer and music
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|So glad grad school is over and reading for pleasure is an option once more.  The Circle is a thought-provoking, uncannily realistic look at social media run amok...with a scary glimpse at herd mentality to boot.  Must read!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|well done movie<br />great pace, good acting<br />It was a very good adaptation from the first novel, which I also injoye
030745455X|5.0|I love the 2nd book just as much as the 1st one.  The story is simple but the writer added so many twista (especially the political one) to it to make it more captivating.  The book is definitely a page-turner, that is, after the first 200 pages. It started slow.  I appreciates how the writer linked in some of the parts from the 1st book.  The ending of the book was crisp, which I much prefer than a lengthy ending.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Great action in this bond movie. good plot line. Superb acting with a good cast. Not enough Bond girls for my liking!
B004K4IZ3G|5.0|This film doesn't get enough credit. Everything from the score to the set design to the wardrobe, to the acting is magnificent. A true sequel worthy of its predecessor. I can't wait to see another one from the makers of this. The Blu-Ray DVD combo is loaded with extras, the sound--- the sound is incredible. If you have a decent sound system make sure to crank that baby up.
B000HF4TIM|5.0|One of my favorite trash movies.  Fast action, some snappy dialogue (and some totally trashy), with typical Bruce Willis insolence.  The ending with the daughter is too pat, like the ending to &#34;Taming of the Shrew,&#34; with the feisty girl (and Willis' wife) becoming suddenly obedient and submissive; however, that's one of the things that make it trashy: not very clear or believable characterizations.<br />  On the other hand, the villains, in Noble Willingham and Taylor Negron, are delightfully slimy, the dangers are appropriately scary, and it's a real treat to see some of my favorite actors just at the beginnings of their careers (notably Halle Berry and Bruce McGill).
B00D3ITOHG|5.0|These headphones are supreme, they are worth every penny and more. These easily rival high end 300$+ headphones, and they beat most of them in my opinion. I have tried a wide variety of professional headphones from Beats studios, Bose, V-Modas, AKG's, and Sonys. If I had to choose which headphones to choose I wouldn't have regrets picking the Marshalls.<br /><br />The creators of these headphones primarily focus on rock and roll music, but these can handle any type of music. I am a dj, and I play a wide variety from EDM to jazz, and these handle brilliantly with everything. Dubstep, trap, classical, rock and roll, a clean and evenly distributed sound is what you get with emphasis on the lows (so its not completely flat, this is on purpose).<br /><br />I highly recommend these, plus you can daisy chain (ability to have a friend plug their headphones into yours) which is always a plus. Really iif you looking for a pair that will last many years, sounds amazing, and look cool, there is no way you can go wrong with these. I couldn't ask for anything else in these wonderfully crafted headphones.
B00GH4RKYM|4.0|Fresh take on the usual run of mill Superman movies of the past. A bazillion times better than the last boring one with lex luther.
B00C8S9VKM|5.0|If you are a trivia buff like I am, you will enjoy Bill Bryson's romp through the summer of 1927. Some facts are well known: Charles Lindbergh's famous flight to Paris from the US, Jack Dempsey's fight with Gene Tunney, Al Capone's antics in Chicago, all gone over with Brydon's fine-toothed comb. But - there are scores more interesting facts: in-depth analysis of baseball including Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig, Bill Tilldon's dominance in tennis, the Great Mississippi flood, many American Nazi sympathies in the lead up to World War II, to name but a few. This is a book to pick up and put down several times so you can soak in all the facts. Enjoy!!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|While everyone has seems to be quite disappointed in this book, I loved it. It's not as action packed as the previous two books and yes, Tris and Four's voices are perhaps too similar...but I think the primary reason many have disliked it is because came too near to addressing real world, systemic issues and the ways in which people/groups put too much effort into solving the wrong root problems (especially given it's setting in a futuristic Chicago) .<br /><br />I loved this book and I loved how the author expressed her worldview through it. I would highly recommend this people to people who are looking to get a bit more than \\"action\\" out of their fiction book choices.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I got this as free app of the day and would say it is worth the 99 cents they are asking.  It seemed a little short but very nicely done.  There is a map and hint system in case you need it and no time limit so great for casual play.  Wasn't too hard but I did use hints when I want sure what to do next and there is no waiting for hint meter to refill.  The story was pretty good to..worth checking out!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|The story is neither cohesive nor believable. It's far fetched really. Which Grisham basically acknowledges in the author notes. Disappointing.
B000054OTY|5.0|One of my all time favorite films. It is a very unique western. Still holds up today. Brando and Karl Malden made several films together.  All classics - On the Waterfront (own that too) and Street Car named Desire.
B009O2XY12|3.0|This little app would be great and my little girl loves it but it don't give you enough bubbles. Once you run out you have to wait 30 more minutes to play again. Unless you want to purchase more with the constant annoying ads.
B0058VW36U|5.0|this is great a good app for problem solving and FUN<br />and there are so much things to do they update total new levels<br />pretty often so get this app
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is so much fun.  I have not been bored all morning.  Recommended for anyone who likes fun HaHa thank you for your time.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is terrifically addicting and fun. It's a great way to pass a little time. Fun rooms and fast pace. I wasn't ever a fan of bingo before but this little game has changed my mind. Try it!  You'll have fun.<br /><br />Fyi this game is free to play and you can actually have fun without spending real money. But if you are cool with in app purchases, you can do that as well.
B00AVPYT8I|4.0|Was fairly skeptical at first,  but the application shines despite its lack of any real literature to speak of.  The detail search was really nice, real descriptive.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|This is a great time killer game and graphics are great, I like the reaction  time and the slow motion shot
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is really fun and it is entertaining. I play on it all the time. I am happy I got this game. Do get this awesome horse game.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This book was absolutely amazing!!! Every part of it. *SPOILER ALERT!* I hate that authors kill off the main characters so often and make me cry, but Roth did an amazing job! Her career is definitely not over and I can't wait to read more of her future books!
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love this app I can take my favorite pictures and memories into master art works and collages I definatly would recommend this app
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I got this app as a free app of the day, and therefore wasn't expecting much. However, I was too quick to judge. This app is stunning! The scenery is beautiful and looks like it came out of a fairy tale book. Even the things in your journal (part of the game) are amazing!The puzzles are challenging but not impossible. If you do find them impossible, there is a hint button to guide you along. Some of the hints give you the show solution option, which is helpful. Others are just the solution where it tells you what to do instead of hinting it, which is the only problem. Otherwise, This app is perfect and I would play puzzle games from this company again!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love it. I don't have to worry about it crashing and it is fun to play. Just wish some of the things that get produced went faster.
B006FO3ERQ|5.0|I found it to be an outstanding read.  The characters were unusual as was the situation. It was  well done!
1416550518|5.0|Good new author. She keeps the reader guessing that's for sure. I can't wait for more, but guess I will have to!
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This book took me on a rollercoaster of emotions. I just can't at this point. The feels are tearing me apart.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|This one is so good that now I'm pissed because I don't have an equally great book to follow it up with.  You know what I mean.<br /><br />Other reviewers will give you better insight into the plot and the characters, but I will tell you that the greatest complement I can give anything is that I'm still thinking about it long after I put it down.  And especially at the very end when I was asked on my Kindle if I wanted to share by rating with other readers.  You have no idea how weird that felt after completing this highly engaging, totally addictive, and extremely current/relevant book.<br /><br />Please eat something first, go to the bathroom and then begin reading - cause you're gonna hate putting it down for any reason at all.
B00GWYSQTU|5.0|An amazing book that will change the way you see life. This book has changed the way I interact with the people around me and with myself. These lessons may sound so simple that it’s common sense, but they are not common practice. I recommend you take the time to apply these techniques as they will make an impact in your life right away. Amazing life tools for life is the motto for this author and I very much enjoy reading his material he has worked on.<br /><br />This book will help you on taking control of your life, taking action on your goals, changing from the inside out, how to use knowledge and not have it control you, and obtaining happiness.<br /><br />I am going to use this book as a reference for life. It has a lot of stuff that you can keep coming back to.
031623480X|5.0|If you were to read just ONE food book in this DECADE, my humble opinion (currently) is this would be the one. As you read the title (and better yet the subtitle) you may think, \\"Geez, that's a little extreme, don't you think?\\" I might suggest re-framing the issue to consider that what's happened to our food supply, the messages we've been conditioned to believe over decades and what we're surrounded by on a daily basis of \\"normal\\" food choices may actually be somewhat extreme.  No, I have not latched onto this book as the \\"holy grail\\" of eating (no such thing) nor do I think everyone needs to abstain all of the time from grain or sugar. I'm merely suggesting there may be some gold nuggets in here to counterbalance some current belief systems, but BETTER YET, have people incorporating some changes that make them FEEL BETTER! Isn't that what we really all want?  I've become immensely interested in food, more than ever, as my husband hit rock bottom with chronic  disease and I've learned how much inflammation (the root of virtually all disease) has to do with what we eat. You may actually feel liberated by some of the things you CAN eat with this book's general philosophy and realize it may be the least deprivational way of eating that could be good for your health! It gives me great hope for the rest of the population for giving some of these suggestions a try watching my husband, a former \\"carboholic\\", actually advocate this general way of eating. Not only is his body healing from reduced inflammation, a bonus is that he does not cart around \\"Excedrin Migraine\\" any more and pop pills several times a week. Lastly, should you choose to read this book, remember, small changes over time can create big results. The small changes you make may need to be tailored for your individual body. I think our brains tend to be on auto-pilot for an \\"all or nothing\\" mentality. Be kind to yourself, have fun, and as one of my new favorite children's book titles reminds us, do this all,\\"A Little at a Time\\".  Oh and if the recipes at the end of the book leave you yearning for more, check out [...] and find oodles of recipes by Maria Emmerich!  Her new book coming out called \\"Keto-adapted\\" has a quote on the cover by Dr. Perlmutter and the forward was written by cardiologist Dr. Davis, author of New York Times bestselling book, \\"Wheat Belly\\".
B007SYWFRM|4.0|My favorite movie is ice age village and im glade that they made a game it's so awsom and addicting to play
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is a terrific book.  A friend recommend it and I was thrilled when I got the chance to read it.  You will enjoy the character development.
B001R4CKGU|4.0|Intriguing. Well told story. Not sure I have read anything like it. Glad that I have a copy of my own. See what you think.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is by far my favorite of the three books! I can read it over an over! Its a must
B0089LOG02|5.0|Exceptional story told with considerable skill. I've recommended this to many people -- kids who were adopted, in foster placement, had loss when young, or have been through an ordeal.
B007EW9ISM|4.0|This stylus works very well on my Samsung Note 2 but not so great on my Surface RT. Or should I say on the screen protectors I put on them (Steinheil Ultra Crystal on the Samsung and Incipio Clear/Anti-Fingerprint on the Surface)? In any case, the cellphone is my main device, so I won't take any stars off for the performance on the Surface. I am taking one star off for two reasons:<br /><br />[1] The rubber shaft attracts dust and dirt. Better grip but I hate seeing white specks all over it.<br />[2] The gap between the tip and the shaft shows poor design and workmanship. The rest of the stylus is solidly built, though.<br /><br />Overall, I would recommend this stylus, especially if you could care less about the dust.
B0087IT8FK|5.0|Friendship and personal integrity. Well worth reading the subtitles. Surprised that I hadn't heard of this movie more. A sleeper, I guess.
0739315293|4.0|This is a FANTASTIC book. HOWEVER, I ordered it as an audiobook, and when I got the package, the heavy paper case was completely smashed. Looks like trash.
B00D8CSVLW|4.0|Held my attention the entire way through, but had a sense that there would be a &#34;twist&#34; at the end.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just finished all three of this series and I didn't want it ever to end. I was very pleased with this entire story. Suzanne Collins really is that kind of writer that you just can't stop flipping the pages she knows how to throw some great curveballs at you which make you just keep turning those pages to find out what happens to your beloved characters. Can't wait to read more by this lovely author
B00BD99JMW|1.0|What a poor ending to a promising series...and not just because it didn't have a happy ending. I read the first two books only months before this one, and can't believe Allegiant was written by the same author. This book was so slow, so dull, so drab, that I found myself skimming pages just to keep from falling asleep. The whole plot reveal about the damaged DNA and other genetic nonsense was just...well, nonsense. The choice to have alternating chapters between Tris and Four, after structuring the first two books differently, felt like a cheap ploy (was it a copy of author Marie Lu's successful format, or just a way to ensure that Four could narrate the final chapters?). The act of killing off a main character felt pointless and contrived; it wasn't necessary, and the death scene was written in such a rushed and fumbling way that it didn't have nearly the impact that it should have.<br /><br />So all in all, this book was a train wreck. I can't help thinking that Roth wrote the first two books with no idea what would happen in the third, then she scrambled for an ending to her trilogy and came up with this sad offering.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so addicting so be prepared! Yet, it is also very fun for the whole family! I definitely recommend it! =)
0345472322|4.0|I first heard of the work of (and this book by) Dr. Dweck from a reference in The Talent Code by Daniel Coyle.  After reading a little of the &#34;Look Inside&#34; tease, I added Mindset to my Wish List, but I never could seem to bring myself to buy it.  My wife finally purchased the book for me a couple of weeks ago as a gift, or it would still be on the Wish List!<br /><br />One of the reasons I couldn't bring myself to purchase the book were the reviews.  The average review was high, but there were a range of mixed reviews.  Now after having read the book, I understand the varying views...and here are mine!  Concepts were new to me, easy to grasp and apply, and logical.  The writing was challenging at times.  Some of the content was questionable.<br /><br />First, the concepts of fixed and growth mindsets were new to me.  That made the book interesting.  It was easy to see these concepts in myself and those around me.  I can honestly say that I was able apply what I learned immediately, and I hope I will continue to do so.  It all made perfect sense to me.  This is the only reason I have rated the book 4 out of 5 stars and not lower.<br /><br />I say the writing was challenging at times because I struggled to stick with it.  The topic was interesting, but the writing didn't always flow for me.  Perhaps it is simply because I am not as educated or practiced as some, so take this comment for what its worth.<br /><br />As for the questionable content, I found the book longer than it needed to be.  Perhaps some liked the examples related to the different areas of life (business, sports, teaching, etc.), but for me, it was simply the same theme over and over.  I was tempted to skip to the end, but I stuck with it in hopes of some new insight.  I glad I did for two reasons.  I did find something worthwhile in each of those chapters, and the last chapter was a bit of a disappointment (skipping to it would have knocked this review down a star or two).<br /><br />Even with all the negatives, I still recommend this book anyone without prior knowledge of mindset.
B00B7Y0206|2.0|it wont let me watch youtube on browser so I tryed to download this and it wont let me what is life
1609611543|4.0|Very interesting book, a real eye opener to how our food choices affect our bodies and hence our health. Easy read.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|The movie was good, very different than what I had anticipated from the preview.  It was rather intense, but I did enjoy it.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is is an amazing game. The graphics are pretty good but other than that, it's great. It's challenging but not so that it's impossible. Overall this is a five star game.
B00785P2QC|5.0|this game I so much fun and I would reccomend it to anyone who likes to be creative. a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This game is amazing!! I normally don't like these kinds of games but this one proved me wrong. Everything in the game is great. The amount of dragons is great, it's easy to use, and there are other things to do like the Colosseum and the Dragon track. Overall this is a five star game.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|i know this is a book aimed at teenagers, but i had fun reading it and i am now on the second book of the trilogy.
0385537131|1.0|I'm amazed at the good reviews on this book!  It had one thing going for it; every time I picked it up, I fell asleep.  I sure got some great sleep over the last few weeks.  Take the first 50 pages or so and the last 50 pages, and there you have the story.  The rest is just repeat, repeat, repeat.  And Grisham seems to want to keep raking it in by getting you to buy &#34;A Time To Kill.&#34;  If I had a dollar for every time he repeated the money involved and repeated the will, I could go out for an expensive dinner.  Grisham's last novel was so spectacular, I should have realized he couldn't do it again, and he didn't!  Grisham also generally uses the same general plot lines including hero lawyer, crooked lawyers, boozing lawyers....he should have a lot of his characters form an AA group!  I can't go on.  Folks, there are SO many good books out there.  Skip this one, that is, unless you're looking for a good night's sleep.
0689835604|5.0|My daugther love this book, is an excelent book, she learn a lot! Is really easy to read! Buy it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love this game. I'm always asking for lives from friends. I think everyone. should try playing this game. very addictive.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|Great movie. Action packed. I love James Bond would watch it again. Can't wait till the next gets released into the movies.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is the best in the world very real win prizes ride and feed the horses I love it
B0009P5YXO|5.0|I needed this to complete my 10th Doctor Cosplay, and it doesn't disappoint.  I did make some alterations though based on some research- I carefully rubbed shoe polish on the crackly body portion to help bring out the texture, and used some sliver paint to make the silver areas more shiny.  The bottom nib does sometimes pop off.  If you aren't going to use the pen I'd recommend gluing it on.  If you take your photos right(without flash) you can get the light to flare slightly in the camera!
B00FAI2IUM|3.0|GT Racing 2 looks good before you buy it. But when you download it, you'll soon find that it's not that good.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Graphics are ok<br />Real cars and tracks<br /><br />Cons:<br />Very hard to progress<br />Minimal cash rewards<br />Controls are pretty terrible<br /><br />And I took a star off for the invalid claim &quot;the best of this year&quot;. Definitely not.<br /><br />Overall: an ok game, but not a real simulator.
B00CT2P6VA|4.0|This game is really addicting and I stay up really late to finish a level than wake up in the morning to start a new level. It really helpful if you're bored or are waiting in line because it's just so fun! I hope I purchase their other games because I love this one! I hope after you've gone through many comments to find this one, you purchase it because so awesome to play and I love it and you should too. You can also get this app on iPhones. Whoever rates this one or two stars is very strange because this is a great game so they should at least give it three!
B00003CXCS|5.0|It' s everything I expected and we're enjoying it. The colors and music is very  clear, just as in the original movie. Thanks.
B00G32OER4|3.0|Some parts are pretty creepy, but some scenes and effects are unnecessarily overdone and that take away from the effect.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|The Governor has access to a tank...this can't be good. This isn't going to be good for anyone. Did they edit the part where Maggie goes on a run for a box of hair color?
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I tried Swype, Android default (the swype kind) keyboard and Swiftkey and I keep coming back to Swiftkey. Why? Because I speak more than one language and on all other keyboards I have to press a button to switch from one language to another. That gets really annoying when you use words from two different languages in the same message or email and you have to go back and forth from one language to another. There's no need to press any button in Swiftkey. You can type seamlessly in any of the languages you installed, just swype away whatever words you want and it will figure out what you wrote and it's right on the money more often than not. it's like they combined the two or more dictionaries in one! So if you're like me and speak 2 or more languages, you have to try this keyboard. I can pretty much guarantee you won't go back to the other keyboard you've been using before.  Please use the buttons below to let me know if my review helped you make a decision.
B001DM1VXE|2.0|This movie's plot has unexplored potential. However, too much emphasis is placed on brooding black & white photography, neglecting the meat of the story. Though ostensibly a story about math, greed, and spirituality, none of these topics receives adequate attention. Rather the focus is on shots of the main character's physical pain and psychological angst, which leaves too much room for the viewer to draw his/her own conclusions. Lacking enough information to stimulate the viewer's interpretation, the viewer is left unfulfilled. My interest was gone halfway through, but I continued watching in the hope things would improve. It is, after all, a film recognized by the Sundance Film Festival.  (Apparently, such recognition does not carry the guarantee of a good viewing experience.) Unfortunately, it gets worse with the introduction of vitriolic Hasidic Jews who weakly assert their &#34;right&#34; to information the main character has. The stereotypical characterization of the Jews borders on offensive. If the whole story wasn't so weak, one might think the offensive portrayal is intentional. In actuality, I think the movie is trying to address materialism in both secular and spiritual worlds; It just does so very poorly.
B00EGMQIJ0|5.0|I will likely read more of Egger's work too. I found the ideas very interesting and very scary at the same time. Privacy and choice are very important to me. This book made me wonder how close are we to imposing these measures on human beings now?
B0063M22QO|4.0|This version is similar to others I've played. It helps my memory and keeps my mind more alert.<br /><br />I like it and recommend it to others.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|cant like the facebook page on kindle fire through the app<br />fix this please but besides that a good game
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I  really like the game but but don't like the limited time given and at one level had to wait  25 hours and I refuse to purchase this type of item, I'm on a limited income.
B00BEIN9VO|5.0|What's better than Justin Timberlake digitally? Justin Timberlake on Vinyl! Just sounds amazing on Vinyl! Brings a little more retro to the sound!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is fun and highly addictive! It doesn't take very long to advance to the next level. Good job!
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is awesome you just have to get it !I love it this game I would never get rid of it ever!!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|:) Great game fun just like.the real thing but you don't get tired or cold on the way to.your favourite hunting spot.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|This game is so awesome but try btd battles it's just like it but you compete against other people it's awesome.
B00009NHC5|5.0|Loved this movie from years ago.  Great suspense and Audrey Hepburn.  Who could argue with that?  Classic.  Don't watch this one alone.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|James Bond is 007. No matter who plays the part.  This was typical Bond action.<br />I give it five stars
B002MQYOFW|5.0|For those that love dystopian settings this is another great book in that genre. Katniss is a far more respectable character and a lot less annoying than other YA female protagonists that have found box office success. 😉
B00B5HQLMI|1.0|Void of any compelling storyline. Had to skip thro many scenes.<br /><br />Would not have watched it, had it not been on Amazon Prime. Did my nails and lunch and couple of other chores while watching it.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I think I would have to say that this version of flow is my favorite of the series by far. I've played flow since the first bare bones version was available. It really makes me happy to see that they've continued to run on this concept, but still make changes and make each new app different and fun. Neon Flow is no exception to that, the sounds, the look, the feel make this latest version of flow absolutely addicting and incredibly fun!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I enjoyed wonder very much because you got to look in the eyes of some of the different characters especially August. He has a deformed face which isn't fun when you get picked on for it and it isn't even your fault.<br />Thanks Palacio for letting us see the life of August 's.
B00992CF6W|5.0|PEOPLE! GET THIS APP! NOW! Minecraft PE is great. I just wish they would add tameable wolves and endermen! All in all, a great game.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This has exactly what i need and nothing i don't. Convenient and simple which is perfect for balancing the check book or other light mathematical tasks. Happy to have found it.
1118109791|5.0|This book really helped me with studying. Gave step by step help and the review made the test easy. It broke down each section and made it simple.  Very easy study guide.
006202406X|5.0|My 14 year old daughter can't get enough of these series. This book was at the top list of her birthday list.
B009O2XY12|3.0|I REALLY ENJOY THE GAME ITSELF BUT I PURCHASED GEMS AND THEY DID NOT REGISTER AND THE SCREEN FREEZES<br />AND I LOSE MY TURNS AND MONEY FAIRLY OFTEN.
B00138EV8U|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. This cd takes me back. I love all of the songs int his soundtrack.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|So, I put off reading this book for as long as I could. I, like the world and his wife had waited (very impatiently) for the final installment of Tris and Four's story. Then I read the reviews, i heard the shocking spoiler, I couldn't run, I couldn't hide. I couldn't make sense of why an author would callously kill off her own beloved protagonist.<br /><br />`Just like that' I heard. It couldn't be true!! Why, why, why why? So I thought if I didn't read it, it would never happen. Tris and Four would be happy farming their dystopian wasteland with at least 10 dysfunctioning babies.<br /><br />Then I finally put on my big girl panties and decided it was time, time to face my fears without the aid of any serum and just bloody read it. Then I could also go on a Veronica bashing spree and be done with it. I could move on and forget an author had butchered and killed my hopes and dreams.<br /><br />What I wasn't prepared for was what I actually read. Tris, Christina and Cara are spared death for revealing the Edith Prior footage. Tobias (Four) knows he cannot stay with his mother Everlyn, she has gone nuts. Power hungry and ruling worse than it ever was in the factions. Jeanine Matthews is dead.<br /><br />Caleb has been sentenced to death (and rightly so, is what I thought) One chance abduction and Tris is brought into the world of the Allegiant. Led by Tori and Johanna they plan to find a better way, one outside the city and one trying to overcome Everlyn's new regime.<br /><br />So the story is set. Trish will travel outside the city with Tobias, Christina, Cara, Uriah, Tori and Caleb the rest will stay and fight. What they find is more horrific than what is inside. They are plunged in a world of double-dealing, lies, back stabbing and more lies.<br /><br />The compound isn't all it seems and neither is the fringe. The enemy isn't who they believe it to be, and their allies aren't either. The story is slow to start with, building piece by piece but that is part of it brilliance. It is EXPLAINED, maybe a slow poke like me needs the slow blow-by-blow account of how the world got the way it was but I was fascinated by the perceptions of the GP's (Genetically Pure) to GD's (Genetically Damaged) to the people in the Fringe (I was expecting Mad Max to jump out on me)<br /><br />What I loved most was Veronica didn't spare us anything, it was an emotional roller coaster of a story, that while I knew (or I thought I did) what was coming, I knew it was the only story she could tell. Tris didn't die because the author got sick of her, or because she knew she was ending the series. This is bloody war people, good people get hurt. Good people die.<br /><br />If you want the happy ending pick up a Disney, better yet don't pick it up. This is a Dystopian world where it is dog eat dog. Tris died because it was the only thing that in the end would save them. I have to admit though, reading Tobias after her death had me running to the bathroom to sob my heart out. To read the 2 very short chapters of when he first noticed her ripped my soul to shreds.<br /><br />I'm still not over that, but it was beautifully done. In the end Tris saved him, and he began to live for her too. Beautiful, brave and haunting story. I won't forget it in a hurry!!<br />Follow more of my Reviews at Never judge a Book by its Movie [...]
B004JHYRAE|3.0|Being single we call it dating. Starting out single and trying this would be one thing, but I never could have done it while in a relationship. And maybe that's the problem.<br />At the very least this book offers insight.
B00FRQ32N4|2.0|It was a fun game but after the first time it wouldnt open again. Fix that and the apps great but every time i try and open it, it just stays on a black screen before it eventually crashes
B007THA4FI|5.0|The woman is a genius. Hard to believe, when so many others fail to make it in an new genre, she could do this. A great read that makes the politics of a small village intriguing and interesting.
B0065CCM76|5.0|Bob Seger takes us on back to the 1970's and on into our heartland.<br /><br />I love creating playlists that are wonderful for diverse groups of people. &#34;Ultimate Hits&#34; is right on as far as getting what is advertised. This collection is long and a great mix from over the years with Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band.<br /><br />&#34;Little Drummer Boy, Travelin' Man (Live) and an almost 6 minutes of Like a Rock.&#34;
B008Y5T5ZE|2.0|In the beginning, it looked to have promise that progressively slipped away as the story unfolded. Unsatisfying ending that relied too heavily on the viewer's opinion and imagination.
B00138KFYO|5.0|Why? Because it is Janis, heart soul and spirit.<br /><br />A must-have for any serious playlist. Any D.J. playing to a diverse crowd, cannot go wrong by having Janis Joplin's Greatest Hits. As I am typing this review I am hearing, &#34;...Suuuuu-mmmm-eeee-rrrr Time,time, time, time...&#34; in that soulful, only Janis voice.<br /><br />RIP Janis Joplin - We will always honor you.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Fun enough but next to impossible to get past the higher levels...then there is the timing thing...you can of course pay for extra lives and helps...or you can give them free advertsing on facebook...not sure it will get kept on my devive or not. All in all it is food mindless entertainment.
B002RI97IY|5.0|This book has definitely brought about a shift in the level of my consciousness. Without doubt I now become aware of the rising discomfort or a sense of hurt ego or anger in any situation much earlier than before, On a day-today basis, I can see a tremendous difference in the quality of my interaction with  those around me now as compared to the earlier times. I think I am not the same person any more..
B00FEMJF6O|2.0|Great graphics, but I've grown so bored of all this simple, extremely slow going games.  The only game that was truly satisfying is Totem Tribe Gold.  I love building and growing a  town, a city or a nation of people and its not slow going like these other games. So, please, those who create these games, take a good look at Totem Tribe Gold.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I did not think I would get sucked in but it's a lot of fun. It's like playing Tetris but with pieces of candy some levels are harder then u think
B008JFUUIA|5.0|Great movie and good price. Got exactly what I paid for an had it shipped for promptly as a midweek surprise and gift for someone.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I keep waiting for something that ruins the experience. even playing a bit more before leaving a review.  This game is genuinely enjoyable; the amount and quality of the content you get with purchase makes the microtransactions fair... even desireable.  There is advertising...  but if it supports thier development... who cares.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Sycamore Row is a good story, but one that could have, should have, been much better.  For starters, the novel's conclusion is telegraphed fairly early on, thus robbing the reader of some of the anticipation which is an important component of mysteries.  That is, however, a minor failing.  Maddeningly, Grisham invests his characters with no flesh and blood.  They are simply roles, not people a reader could get to know, to admire or hate, to root for or against.  As a consequence I found myself not caring who won the case, who inherited the fortune and who was left out in the cold.  It is said one should criticize a book for what it is, not what it is not.  So be it.  Sycamore Row is a good story.  It is a mediocre book
B00CWY76CC|3.0|its slow going, but if u have the time, its fun. the puzzles will sometimes confound until u realize the obvious.
B009ZZDNT6|4.0|this is just wbat i have been looking for i need seversl alarms for my medication this works alot better than other apps i have.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|This item does what its suppose to. Nothing fancy but it works! streams and will display PC via Google chrome.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addictive.  I wanted to keep on playing to see just how many levels I could successfully complete.  I like that there is a choice not to play a timed game as I do not do good with  those type of games.  This game would appeal to those who like mind puzzles and mazes.
B00EP0SIOG|5.0|After reading all the reviews and evaluating the features, I went ahead and purchased Sphero as a Christmas present for my little brother. He's into video games and shooting anything that moves. What better way to make him happy than to give him a lightening fast ball that has a mind of its own and also contains a bunch of virtual games-on-the-go? I can't wait to see the expression on his face when he opens it! I'm pretty sure he'll be stoked about my decision, because I am. Come Christmas day, we'll both be eager to find out what's in store!
B009HQ9UHC|4.0|This is a great game but one month before Christmas the game went blank every time we touched it to play.  Great Cristmas gift  Santa!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This was so fun. A challenge but solvable. Much better than others I have played. Had a lot of fun can't wait for another one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|If you have kids they will definitely love this game! It's definitely worth its value because it an awesome and addicting game to play! I am sure you will LOVE this game!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Easy to use. Works very well. These are definite positives as there are some apps that aren't. I haven't found anything that I would call a negative about this app.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I have nearly endless hours of fun. I can play it hours on end and have fun doing it. I recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh over and over.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|started fine but became mundane, predictable with too many unresolved threads.  it tries to cover so many things wrong with afganistan with out adequately pursuing the issues behind them or the possible resolutions that are achievable.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|AWESOME book dudes they need a little help finding his stub because they are really stupid than they look so yeah
B00BI5IXL4|1.0|A less-than-miserable butchering of Alexander Dumas' original graphic novel! And the natural purity of Puccini's classic soundtrack is completely undermined by the Neptune's electronica remix.<br /><br />I was also a bit underwhelmed by Kurt Russell's portrayal of Charles Darnay. While his lines were accurate to the letter, he lacked the sublime, nasally vocals characteristic of all the exceptional Broadway, off-Broadway, South Jersey, and home school co-op renditions.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A great game for those times that you just want to pass the time. I love this hammer and my buds play the game all the time at school.

B00DWZHTRW|4.0|Enjoyed the movie and the blu ray was really nice. Would definitely recommend this to anyone who wants to sit by the fire and watch a movie.
B004VMX5TQ|5.0|As usual...Bob Seger and the Silver Bullet Band is Awesome! I have never been disappointed with any of his albums.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|This is a really cool flick. Really like the parallels to the old star trek. Blu ray is awesome and I would recommend this flick to any trekkie.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|You'd never expect a game about destroying humanity to be this fun! I really love the strategy involved in, well, killing everyone.
B0079IEPHA|5.0|Love this show and have had a lot of enjoyment being able to rewatch it on DVD. Would recommend this to everyone.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|This item, at best, is a 'beta' device.  It needs a lot of tweaking before it will be useful.  While the streaming works well with the native support for YouTube, Pandora and Netflix, trying to stream from your laptop or android device results in jerky unwatchable video. Even tried it with a local file as well.<br />I already have a roku which gives me far more versatility than this item has in terms of quality streaming to my TV.  The only thing I was looking for was a device that would allow streaming to the TV from laptop or android device; in this latter regard the device fails miserably.  The only reason I gave it two stars is that the native supported streams work fairly well.
B00G4CXHSK|4.0|I have actuallyhad a lot of fun with this game. Its like megaman without all the different powers. I would love if they made this compatible with bluetooth controllers or even my xperia play... MAKE IT WORK with controllers and this game would be a 5 stars
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Another great game from fire maple games. The artwork is beautiful, the puzzles are challenging but intuitive and ingenious and game works flawlessly. I am never disappointed by their games. I highly recommend this and all their games.
B00F8H0LM2|4.0|Very good game BUT ADS ARE ANNOYING AS HELL. They make tons of money on everything they brand and now bother us with all these ads.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I've been a fan for 20 years and NKOTB never disappoints. I must've listened to it all day and night for the first 3 months after purchase. It has a mature sound and certainly showcases a more sophisticated range. The interior sleeve shows some incredible pictures as well. I thoroughly enjoy it and look forward to future releases.
B007EC27QM|2.0|Same or worst then the oem calculator  that camee with my galaxy note or my xperia play. I would not oay for this and be happy with it. NEXT!
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|For Neil Gaiman's first &#34;novel for adults&#34; in years, I was hoping the book would be more, well, adult. Though enjoyable, I couldn't nag the feeling that I was reading a tween blockbuster the entire time. Still would recommend to friends into Gaiman or the supernatural.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Great but gets kinda boring real fast. great game to get for free however. Dont think this is the nexxt big thing m it`s not.
B0025WX2YW|5.0|Perhaps the best word to summarize the second season of the Showtime original series, &#34;The Tudors&#34;, is, &#34;divorce&#34;, for in it, Henry VII divorces himself from his first wife, Catherine of Aragon, divorces England from the Roman Catholic Church, divorces and condemns former friends and allies and, finally, divorces himself from reason by condemning and executing the very woman he divorced his first wife for.  This season is a, &#34;must see&#34;, for all those who are entranced by power and the abuses thereof by the most famous, and infamous, king in English history.
B00BR4QNJ0|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to come out. It has great graphics.All I can say is best game ever.I am going back to playing it again!
B00ET0PZDO|5.0|Fun game. Wish there were more rooms. Hard but not ridiculously. If u need help go on youtube they do walk throughs for each level.
B00GINENG0|5.0|This is an awesome game I recommend this game a lot because it is great for children and other kind of people !!!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have waited for a long time for this to be on my Kindle Fire.  It's perfect and large enough to see, unlike my phone which has a smaller screen than my Kindle. So happy, happy, happy.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I love the hunger games trilogy this one is my favorite  I could not put it down. This book is full of twists and turns packed with action and adventure. It made my jaw drop and my eyes tear up. This is such an amazing book!!!!!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|It's a different twist to solitair, games go really fast and are challenging. Good way to pass the time when you're traveling.
B00CIH371W|5.0|Not at ALL what I was expecting...but what a powerful read! Suspenseful and full of twists and turns, masterfully written. An unlikely heroine, the Mafia, spiders, crime and corruption. You will enjoy this book all the way through to the very last page.
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I really liked this book because it was funny and had suspense and then it gave you all the answer at the end.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I like the variations on each level keeps you challenged. The only problem is I would like a few more seconds when the clock starts ticking.
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It has been the only one like this that I have managed to keep playing on a daily basis with no complaints.
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Script & writing were a bit predictable and cliche. Performances shine, however. Don Cheadle and John Goodman made the film come together. The scene when Whip raids the mini bar is like nothing I've seen in movies, except for the booze shopping scene in Leaving Las Vegas.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Great movie!  The HD version was fantastic.  The picture was crystal clear.  Looked great!  I would highly recommend this movie.
B005XUC398|3.0|Started out well, and has great starpower, however the movie became a bit tedious as it went on. i cannot recommend it.
B00AS1Q93S|5.0|Excellent action movie with good twists and turns.  Although there is shooting and violence there is no gore and up close blood.
0060919760|5.0|A classic best seller from Wayne Dyer. Excellent book for identifying these little but hurting behaviors that would not allow you to live a happy life independent to others.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great movie sound quality just in time for part two<br />The price was also great  only paid $10.00 excited.<br />Thanks amazon
0375842209|1.0|I like to finish what I start, and I really dislike the thought of not finishing a book.  I have plodded through some books that took forever, but I finished them.  Not so with this book.  I keep seeing it on lists of \\"must-reads\\", and I have tried at least three times to read it, but in the end I just could not.  The time I would have spent trying to get all the way through it would have been part of my life I would never get back.  I tried to use it as a soporific, as I did The Blue Sword (I did not enjoy that book, but I DID finish it), but it wasn't even good for that.  The part I read was just not \\"together\\"; so much of it was vague.  I struggled to finish, because I hate to not finish things, but alas, I just could not submit myself to any more of this book.<br /><br />I read a lot of historical fiction and non-fiction, and I have read extensively on WWII.  But there are so many well written books out there that I just could not spend any more time on this one.  I was flabbergasted to see there is a movie being made from this book.  Since so many movies depart drastically from their books, the movie might be okay.  I won't be spending any money on it though; I'll wait and check the DVD out from the library.
1401322786|5.0|Absolutely wonderful! Iove this book. I read it in just a few hours because I just couldn't put it down.  Such an amazing story. With such a profound message. It hits home with anyone I would imagine. Ive given this book to almost everyone I know as gifts. Its an amazing story.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|Good price bought for granddaughter<br />I will not be giving you any more ratings.  I will be ignoring any future requests for ratings as I do not think it should be required to leave a required amount of words and then an additional Headline that is also required.
006202406X|5.0|An Amazing conclusion to the trilogy! Made my heart sad once it was all said and done but it was well written and kept the pages turning
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is a great book. I just wish Katniss would fall for Petta in this book. I love this book.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I bought this for a good friend who had never seen the movie, I didn't know such a person existed!
B00BMNM4H6|3.0|This one  is a good time waster.  It's the kind you can use in the waiting room at the doctor.  It becomes more difficult as you go along and trying ti figure out how to get the sugar in the right cup becomes a streatch of your thinking.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I watched the first episode of this show one day because it was in the DVD player.  It starts slow, but it picks up, and before I knew it, I was hooked.  This is an excellent series and watching them back to back made the experience more enjoyable.
B00CGNYDIE|4.0|I had fun. It kept my interest even when i made silly mistakes. Sometimes i couldn t make my which to choose so i guessed. Sometimes right some times wrong. Beautiful pictures are revealed.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|This is the first racing game that I have had that I had to turn the whole tablet to steer.
0345536886|3.0|The first 2/3 of the book is great but the ending is weak. The book also lacks focus - is David Zinc is the main character? If so - there are 2 cases, in the first he plays a secondary role in the trial, and in the second there is no trial. I expected many Perry Mason moments but there is just one. The book has potential but falls flat. Grisham does not write pure legal thrillers, at least not any more. He, through his characters, has become very moralistic and preachy, and that kills some of the fun.  .
B00932A4XE|3.0|Cute movie about the trials and tribulations regarding motherhood.  I watched the movie as I was in the mood for light entertainment.
B00BAXFAOW|4.0|Reading a Gladwell book is like chatting with an interesting friend. You may not buy into everything they tell you, but their conversation inspires new areas of thought and may challenge you to reconsider previously held beliefs. Malcolm's books have all achieved this distinction with me and more, his stories are also enjoyable and easy to read. You're not going to find yourself wishing you had a dictionary or degree in his subject matter, he can take complex subjects and weave stories that make them understandable and enjoyable. As I finish the last pages I'm left with a longing for more, but also the fulfillment of having been on a long journey and feeling accomplished for the new experiences acquired along the way.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Fire Maple Games knows how to make a great point and click adventure.  Like lost city, the adventures of Mosaika had me playing from start to finish without break.  I could not put it down.  I cannot wait till the next installment from Fire Maple Games.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I love this game it's really addictive you have to join the colours red circle to red circle ,blue circle to blue circle ext  you cannot cross over the colours it gets you mind thinking and with my brain I need it lol
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|My son loves this game, would be nice if every free game didn't try to exploit money though to complete the game.
B00EVW0SA0|5.0|Great movie and had funny moments in it. It had a lot of action in it but also had a surprise ending since since everything changed.<br />Trying not to spoil anything for people.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|great action packed movie.hope they put more out like this.great choice for actors in this i liked all the main character choices.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game. Keeps  My mind sharp. Can hardly wait for more levels. Very challenging and good for solving difficult problems.
B00992CF6W|3.0|From my son:<br />PLEASE MAKE it so everyone can blow up TNT in creative,and I want potions in survival.<br /><br />PS:can there be mobs in creative.PLEASE!!!!
B00GX598FO|5.0|Almost better than the original. Helps if you see the first one, but only as a background to the characters. Loved it.
B000K4WLXA|5.0|I purchased this coz its a collector's set, and I love FF. Haven't opened it and probably never will (:
B00FCR3JQS|5.0|Very beautiful photos and interesting characters. Represented different people from different cultures, who moved by desire to be outstanding from others. Optimistic point of view - the best part of the show!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Could not put it down.  Loved how the lives of the families intertwined.  The characters all seemed so real.  Loved the ending. Excellent writing.
B00C0ALZ0W|4.0|The guys from 37signals hit the nail on the head again. If you've read their blog, followed Jason or David on Twitter, or just familiar with &#34;Getting Real&#34; or &#34;Rework&#34; then some of what you'll read here isn't totally new.<br /><br />That being said, there's lots of goodies here. As technology has progressed, it's never been easier to work from anywhere, as long as the work you're doing lends itself to doing so. This is an argument I've had with many bosses, managers, and co-workers over the years. Jason and David do a fantastic job of explaining why the old ideas are outdated and why working remotely can, quite simply, work.<br /><br />While much of the book has been covered in smaller bits in their other works (including blog posts or Jason's TED talk), this book is hyperfocused on the idea of being a remote worker and a company/manager of remote workers. If you're looking to to convince your boss to let you start working remotely, this is a must read book. &lt;b>This book isn't for companies already doing this like 37signals, Github, or even Intel (mentioned in the book), but rather those companies that aren't utilizing a remote working strategy or those that refuse to even consider one&lt;/b>.<br /><br />There will be lots of people who dismiss this book saying things like &#34;it won't work for my team/company/employees&#34; and those people may be right, but that doesn't mean it won't work for others. There's more than one way to work, and these guys aren't just talking about it, they're doing it.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|What a movie ! Plenty of action and a dose of heart felt love. If I don't rent this again, I'll buy it. It has the reseeability  factor of at least a 9.5.  Good plot with good twists.  Lots of laughs and a few tender moments, mixed in with awesome fight scenes.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|This is one of the best games I have ever played! Buying all the cheats and new viruses are worth it!
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Great movie.  My sister recommended this to me and I love watching it at Christmas.  Arrived on time and as advertised.
B005XQLBU4|5.0|played one time but kids like it.  not real high tech but good for those who like the old games
0525478817|5.0|I loved this book so much  I bought it as a present for my friend. It's a very touching story with a jaw dropping twist. I would definitely recommend this book for fans of young adult novels and fans of realistic stories that examine the lives of the terminally ill. 5/5 stars for sure.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Good app to have on any device. Fantastic for planning, sharing, and pinning, to friends,  family,  or any followers, overall amazing app!!!
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Very fun game! One of my favs! :) I definitely love playing this game on my kindle. It's a great source of fun and passes the time
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|I am a bit interested in superheroes for my son. I want him to have a good role model somewhere in the movies, since TV is about dead, but I found this to be a good movie, but would give it a 5 because I enjoyed the special effects, but also the story. It is a bit different from the Superman I grew up with but still has good values, but I also enjoyed the GLADIATOR effect, I'll call it. In fact, I think the backstory was the most powerful part, but I am a bit of a sucker for a good story. I would give it to anyone with a son, or a girl needing a good role model because Lois Lane was a bit of a bruiser, but a good mortal match for Superman. I do hope they can figure out how to make Wonder Woman again because girls, and women, still need a good hero, but I am not as into comics as I could be. Perhaps Wonder Woman is too hard for the big screen, but a small screen series seems a better place for a reboot. Loved Henry Cavill, but he will need a bit more acting lessons if there is a sequel because the special effects will need to be a bit less to keep humanizing Clark Kent, but also the relationship with Lois Lane. Hope Hollywood can keep perspective on the other superheroes because the world needs a hero, still, since Jesus Christ has long been dead but a Superman can keep hope alive to mere mortals. Boy, I am going on, aren't I, but I did like and and wonder who in this world wouldn't since it seemed a bit well rounded. I want to see a bit more of Lois Lane in the next one, but a bit less CGI, but I can see this is a good place to reboot the movie series. Best wishes for your viewing pleasure!
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|That I feel is comparable to the actual Dungeon's &amp; Dragons I played when younger,  plus the adventure feel of Zelda
B00AESN8XY|5.0|It's a pretty fun game that requires some strategic thinking is fun for a while but it's really only fun if you want to try to beat all disease types on brutal.
1594489505|4.0|Didn't think as good as the first book which I liked better.<br />Both were interesting to read.  Learned a lot abou the culture.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|I really enjoy these types of games. Each individual puzzle is quick to play. Even the more difficult ones are not a huge time investment - it's the need to play \\"just one more\\" that sucks the time away! There are a wide variety of levels of difficulty so it is easy to find a puzzle suitable for small children, or adults, or anyone in between.
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|Not as good as Monsters Inc, in fact it's bit slow getting started, but it delivers and well worth renting.  There's still a lot of humor and charm and we enjoyed watching it.
B00F6HDCZ2|5.0|Really entertaining and sort of quite known.....love to listen to all Storm books also,so please get them all on Audio
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Lots of fun and really helps pass the time when waiting at the doctors office. Others wanted to help with the hunt.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|Why was this the end of all,it should not be.....<br />And  that  was the End of Firefly. Please try to get the show back.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|It is a very enjoyable movie that Keeps your interest and you feel that you are one of them I have watched it many times and still enjoy it.
B00BAXFECK|2.0|Enticing opening chapter, then it disappoints!  I bought this book on my kindle for 40 hours of airplane time. If I weren't trapped with nothing else to read I would not have finished this book.  The characters are wooden, they never are developed. I found I didn't particularly care what happened to them. The plot lines didn't make sense. Things seem to happen just to fulfill the authors needs they were not intrinsic to the story.  I don't need to go into a long explanation.  Skip this and just read Dickens.
B0010SEMP0|5.0|This is the second book in this entertaining, funny, romantic series. If you like hot vampires and kick-ass heroines this is the perfect series for you!
B000FCKBCU|5.0|Such a cute story! Sophie Kinsella is a great author. This story was so enjoyable that I passed the book on to my mom when I was finished reading it.
B003LL3LHO|5.0|The book is well written, story is divulged off client not also included in the video game. It's got some traces of mid evil fantasy and war and is very well originally told. I would suggest this book to any guild wars series fan or read it all.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Fabulous Find! My fellow science teachers and I use this video series on a regular basis in the classroom. A &#34;must have&#34; for any life science classroom.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is so cool. It is the best fighting that I have ever bought , but it's hard to save money.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Dr. Sleep is King's sequel to one of his classics, The Shining, and it's not at all what you expect. It is a very good story, and it was good to catch up with Dan Torrance, son of Jack, all these years later. It wasn't as scary as I would have liked and the antagonists really never had a chance, but I think that is besides the point as this is a book about the antagonists inside that are much more difficult to defeat.<br /><br />A welcome addition to the Stephen King library.
B009O2XY12|5.0|This game keeps me concentrating on all the different matches and I really enjoy something that challenges me. I Would highly recommend this app to all that enjoy a challenge..
B0089AD8IO|4.0|Really enjoyed this first season. I remember seeing the original series on PBS when I was a kid, but have to admit I didn't actually watch it. I found this first season to be quite good. The acting is where it needs to be and for the most part the storylines are engaging. The special effects are definitely a detractor in my eyes when cgi is involved, far less so in the use of physical objects of course and there are a few episodes I didn't particularly care for, but felt they were saved by the humor, overall I would highly recommend this show to those who love quirky sci-fi.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is Fun and a good way to pass time anywhere I love the visual features and its fun for all ages I love it !!!! IT WORKS GREAT ON MY KINDLE!!!So that's a good thing and it is all free it's not a rip off like other games.!
B00GX50BD2|5.0|of course I did not KNOW Steve Jobs , But Ashton NAILED it!<br />good movie, amazing life ...gone too soon
0316228532|5.0|About the book - it gets a bit windy in parts of it. Not for her usual children's audience. But if you are an adult, STICK WITH IT and read the whole thing. The way it all ties together in the end is genius, obviously.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|Another time consuming and wonderfully enjoyable addictive game. Love this type keeps mind going. Brilliant fun for all. Looking forward to playing game.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I loved the game because it made me think a little and I thought that it was cool. I saw my friends playing it so I said I need to get in on the fun.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Another fun game to spend your time playing. Always looking for more bubble popping games. A good time for all.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|This book is typical of Gresham books from his early writings.  It is a captive court room drama, filled with many plots and out of the blue twists and turns.
B00BAXFJ5M|3.0|The 5th Baldacci novel featuring former Secret Service agents having the last names King and Maxwell, I am guessing this book was written to capitalize on the now-cancelled-after-one-season-in-2013 TV show named &#34;King and Maxwell.&#34; They are now in business together as private investigators who have storied histories individually and with one another, which facts we are reminded of frequently in the book. King is older and actually served in the Presidential detail; Maxwell served in another capacity and is a former Olympian, triathlete, continuing rower, a lead foot behind the wheel, a slob, and more tech savvy. All of these characteristics come to play in this novel, which features computer texting, hacking, satellites, the Presidential limousine, and other technological matters, and are the subject of bantering between the two. The precise nature of their relationship is unresolved, and provides some sexual tension.  At the gripping beginning of the novel, Maxwell,in addition to her usual angst,  is still recovering emotionally and physically from childhood trauma which was brought to the fore in the prior book. That doesn't last long, as she is soon chasing after, and variously tackling, sniper shooting from 12 feet up in a tree, good and bad guys.  King reveals some new information about himself to his partner. It is both a surprise that he hasn't done so earlier, and also provides a key element to make a preposterous plot even more incredible. Maxwell and KingI won't spoil anything for those who have not yet but plan to read the book. Suffice it to say, however, that it involves all-too-common corruption at a high level of government and with government contractors and Special Forces members. Readers of Vince Flynn and Lee Childs will find this plot line familiar, as well as the ubiquitous shootouts in coffee bars and explosions and motels and other sites in and around DC. The penultimate event is absurd. All of this caused me some head shaking, becametiresome and diminished my enjoyment of the book.  It's too hard to suspend reality when there is so much factual reality going on.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love it. Love it! Did I tell you I ABSOLUTELY LOVE THIS APP?  I have it on my phone and on my kindle!
0061714402|5.0|Really good book.  I've read this one twice already because an interesting read and I'm a big Megadeth fan.  It really goes into his early days in Metallica and how he started up Megadeth.  Also deals with his drug problems and how he overcame them.  Recommended to all Megadeth fans.
B004UIOUHC|5.0|Very easy to use, right away.  Easy to bookmark pages and exit the browser.  I wish I had tried this sooner, because the browser that came with my phone was very non-intuitive.
B0087240Z4|4.0|Decent album from the Pumpkins.  Not as good as their early 90's stuff, but definitely listenable.  My favorites on the album are Pinwheels, Pale Horse and The Chimera.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this because I could do more stuff and it is cool. It took me a week to make a hotel!
B005DF2QMC|2.0|The DBTech Audio USB Portable Cassette ran at normal speed sometimes which was good but sometimes ran at high choppy speed which made conversion to MP3 difficult.The uneven performance of this product makes it not worthy to buy.I suggest buying another product or buying a 3.5 mm male to male Stereo Audio Cable to convert Tapes to MP3's instead of this pile of junk.
B00GNK18X4|5.0|Our family are BIG 1D fans. We love this new album! My favorite is the Story of My Life. This album seems to spread the singing around a bit more. It makes for a great album.
B009NF54ZE|5.0|I liked the 2nd one as much as the first one. great storyline and a variety of of puzzles. it was lots of fun I would recommend this one
B008JFUPFI|5.0|Got this as a gift from my husband! I have been trying to see this movie for quite some time (long story). Watched it on our 60&#34; tv outstanding film and action. Not to mention Henry Cavill is the next Superman in my book!!
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|please update... will give 5 stars once I can play the rest of the game. I'm on level 463 on other devices.... what's. the hold up
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Nice time passer, really love this game I play a lot with my wife. And with the family on Facebook.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|kinda similar to Mario bros. fun to play and pass time. like the arrow controllers. easy to play for grownups and older kids.
B00GII9UCW|4.0|They sound great together and it's really easy listening but the easy listening at times becomes a bit monotonous to me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Super fun.  I really, really like it.<br />I can not beat my dad on this game.  He is the newest.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The characters were great!  The story was good.  I like that the family is important to the main character and I like his honesty.  There was enough suspense and mystery to keep me interested.  I remembered some of the characters from &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;.  Small towns help make good stories.
B00G5G7FL0|5.0|Amazing!!! We loved this film. The music is phenomenal, and there is never a dull moment. I definitely recommend! One of my favorite top Disney films.
B004LWZW9C|2.0|This movie is a complete waste of talent. The plot is contrived beyond anything believable. Usually I like a good sappy flick as much as the next chick, but this is one movie to skip.
B007QA3AH2|5.0|If you don't think Galaxy Quest is a cinematic treasure then get out of my face.<br />I will fight you I swear to god
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|This game is so addicting, started out for the kids, now I am hooked. LOVE playing this game when they are down for a nap.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|I would really enjoy this game without the glitches ,at this point I have to in a really patient mood to play.
B00992CF6W|5.0|That is the top #1 creeper! He will blow your mind off!! I play this game every day all day. They call it minecraft because you mine, and then you craft it. GET IT! Minecraft.
076790592X|5.0|Had to get this for class and I am not into books. This book was amazing and great meaning to it. A must read.
B00GP0G0IK|5.0|I love the game and the story line and the alternate ending..... awesome. I normally don't want to re play games but I will this one.
B00DJFIMW6|1.0|I downloaded it, tapped the icon.... and this &amp;#34;let it download 27.70 MB&amp;#34; crap. I let it download then it needed to download!!! Don't get this game. It's so stupid! Ugggghhhh!!!!!!!
B00479SVBU|5.0|This is my second one. Both are in use too. I have 2 Ford pick ups that didn't have a CD or MP3 capability and didn't really want to go to the trouble of replacing them with an aftermarket unit. The F350 we use to haul the horse trailer across many states and with this we don't have to bother with losing the FM stations. My F150 is my personal transportation around town and have used it to haul an RV from Mich. to S.C.. Charleston didn't even have an oldies station and I suffered without my Soundfly. Now I'm thankfull not to have to listen to all that &#34;music&#34; that I just can't enjoy to hear the occasional song that I do.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Started playing and now I can't stop. It's not going to outwit me. My daughter thinks she will do better than me, hahaha,NEVER!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this game is highly addictive. at time it can be frustrating when you ate stuck on a level. but you should totally buy this app I am on it at least 4 or 5 times a day
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Love this show an watch this show as often as I want too and not get bored of it,so great!
B00BXLU1EU|5.0|It is so much fun it lets you get WIFI so you can watch netflix and do draw something free.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion Rush is a runner game and doesn't just rip off Temple Run.  This game is cute and whenever I died, I laughed at the adorable Minion. I also think that this game is fairly difficult. There are 5 environments and over 20 Minion costumes. The locations range from The Mall to Gru`s Neighborhood. This game is funny and I literally forgot other reasons for having my Kindle Fire. The gameplay is smooth and well done, being very responsive. I highly recommend you get this game.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Enjoyed the revisiting of the &#34;Shining&#34; and the Dan character. The &#34;True Knot&#34; take on the vampire theme made it a totally new and interesting plot. Another winner by Mr. King, who I've been reading for about 35 years now!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is fun, hours of fun. Keeps on getting better as you travel through different levels unlocking new area's, and upgrading sweet weaponry.  5 star, and a must for your game collection.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Great game. Has specials that no other games offer. Free power ups. black Friday card special.  Just need to raise points.
B004478AS4|1.0|In my opinion this is a horrible book. It is boring and almost has no plot whatsoever. I had to read this for my English class and I have ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHAT TO WRITE ABOUT! I do NOT recommend this book.
B004GYY714|5.0|Love the ability to tune in the world of my favorite music. I use it most of the day every day
B00CE03UOC|5.0|It's pretty easy at first but becomes challenging as it moves up in levels. Makes you think strategically and develops problem solving skills.
B00124PXW8|5.0|It is incredibly scary but at the same time deeply religious and philosophical. It is not for everyone, so if it starts to bother you, you might want to stop watching it.
B000002J03|5.0|Led Zep II is rock n' roll.  Every song is amazing.  Then again, you could say that about every Zep song and album.  With that said my favorite song if I had to choose 1 would be Thank You.
B00F87ZUYG|3.0|Each episode is going too slow. They are milking it.<br />It needs to evolve faster with more action and drama.<br />Season 1 they traveled sooo much and now they sit at the jail and garden. Slow.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The best insight anyone has had into how the role of past president's support the current office holder. Explains how presidential pension and office support came to be. Well researched and interestingly presented.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun and challenging game.  Different level present new challenges. The game can be played without purchasing anything.  It is not necessary to log onto Facebook.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Well developed story told with an interesting nod to history. The past three Grisham novels have all delivered after a few disappointments. Sycamore Row returns defense attorney Jake Brigance to the courtroom with the colorful characters (Lucien, Harry Rex, Ozzie) that connect the past to the present.
B007FROH4G|2.0|Found it confusing and patchy with lots of holes in character development and relationships that left me unsatisfied. The subject matter was of interest to me but it failed to convince me for these particular characters.
B005721W9O|5.0|A great satire of Star Trek, awesome cast, very funny and just as cheesy, and predictable, and I love it!
B00ABKGG0C|4.0|Great first half but slows towards the end.  Character work was good. World was believable Overall not holding my breath for more.
B005LAII80|5.0|LOVED the bluray quality. Great picture and sound. This movie is VERY action packed and there is rarely a dull moment! LOTS of great extra footage and commentary included which was a nice surprise. If you like sci fi action you will love this movie!
B006M595FI|4.0|Got it for my eldest daughter, and she loves it. Slow and smokey. Reminds me a touch, just a touch, of Fiona Apple's first album.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I thought this was a great film about a man breaking his chains of slavery and becoming free. It has lots of great actions scenes and also a surprising amount of comedy thrown in to lighten the tone of the film. Django becomes a skilled bounty hunter and really finds a calling in life.
B005LAII80|5.0|This movie makes the Stallone Dredd get down on its knees before it executes it.  It's everything that movie should have been.<br /><br />1) Dredd NEVER takes off his helmet.<br />2) Dredd fights a crime lord instead of some convoluted crap story involving Armand Assante.<br />3) Dredd mercilessly kills criminals.<br /><br />It was damn near perfect in my eyes.  It's a real shame that this movie tanked at the box office, relegating most action films to being PG13 soft crap instead of hard R.  Boooooo!!!!!!
B00GII9UCW|5.0|I was surprised to read that Billie Joe had never heard the album before since I've been singing Songs Our Daddy tought Us all my life.  When my granddaughter told me about it last night, I assumed I wouldn't like it because I usually hate covers, but I do.  I've never heard of anyone doing a cover of an entire album before.<br /><br />There are a couple of guitar spots that remind me of Johnny Cash's Luther, and other songs are reminiscent of Raising Sand by Robert Plant and Alison Krauss, which I also love.  I'm glad I bought this MP3, but I wish the comment tracks were on it.  I hate having to buy the CD to get them since I have no place to keep CDs any more.  I think this is an album which will only sound better the more I listen to  it.
B000GY729M|5.0|My favorite album of all times. This is The Killers at their best making the kind of music no one else can
B00G21XNKU|3.0|Quality of special effects is great as is the acting and it answers a lot of questions while leaving the door open to future stories but....it was a lot of hype for just a good story.
0812415825|3.0|I thought that the book would be more powerful. However I suppose given the times it was written then it would have had more of an impact on it's readers.
B00C0ALZ0W|5.0|Remote is not just a book about pie in the sky thinking of remote Nirvana where everyone works wherever they want to. It is truly a book based on the real experiences of an actual company. It is for this reason that the common sense information in this book cannot be dismissed.<br /><br />I currently work for a company that believes that babysitting is paramount to everything, including organization and proper project management. This book reaffirms everything I thought was wrong with the company I work for and shows me that I truly can find a better way to work.<br /><br />In addition, the book itself is well-written and a makes for an entertaining read. Congratulations Jason and David for writing such a fantastic book.
0375714839|5.0|These comics are beautifully drawn and written.  I learned a lot from this collection, which you could probably consider pathetic for me.  There are lots of laugh out loud moments, paired with awful, gutwrenching ones.  Definitely worth a buy.
B00005JN0T|3.0|not the book, only influenced by Asimov's wisdom not a portrayal of his stories.  Maybe they will make a movie of Asimov's Foundation Earth and stay true to form.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|much like downton abbey which i love...great character studies...has action, romance, fun, and quick moving scenarios.  The typecasting of characters is very good...
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is great never freezes and is always something new way to go flow free! fun fun fun fun
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Beautiful scenes and a great fantasy story!  Lots of challenges that open magic doorways into more puzzles and clues. No glitches!  Solved in one relaxing night.  Kindle Fire first gen. I will certainly look for more games from Fire Maple Games.  Awesome job!
B004RJMUJO|1.0|This game unexpectedly quits every time that i try to open it. This happens in 2 devices that I have Samsung galaxy note 2 and motorola xoom
B00AEBBA9U|5.0|One of the really Great films!! Gloria Swanson is just outrageous and steals the show completly!!! Early William Holden who got the part cause Monte Cliff turned it down!!! One of Billy Wilders Greatest!!!
0142180300|5.0|I apologize for my belated rating despite your repeated asking .Nevertheless I received the order in due time.<br />I am quite pleased that I ordered the book as it explains a number of rather complicated things in simplified terms<br />accessible for a number of non-specialists . Although it does not particularly belong to the topic of the book, I would nevertheless have been happy to find also in the simple words which the author is able to use, if possible a brief explanation of the concept entanglement . Nevertheless I want to give a high rating to the book and recommend it to anybody interested in the field. My remark about the entanglement has only to do with the fact that it is a complicated concept and that ,although,as I said above ,it has no direct connection with the topic of the book , it would have been interesting to read an explanation for it in the words of the author<br />Marcel Van Beylen.,professor of Chemistry
B001P829VY|5.0|WHAT A CLASSIC!!!! Now on Blu Ray makes it even more enjoyable!!!!!One of the All Time Great Films!!! Walter Huston steals the show!!!
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Very interesting. Holds your attention. One you can't put down. First time to read book by this author. I will look form more
B00FGFVMGA|1.0|I thought this would be fun but I found it very difficult to play. Not sure how to move around and pick up stuff. Maybe someone can explain it to me. I love the other games I have like this but this one to totally has me stumped.
B000002GVO|5.0|THE EAGLES ARE MAGNIFICENT!  I RECENTLY WNET TO ONE OF THEIR CONCERTS AND THEY ARE JUST AS GOOD TODAY AS THEY HAVE EVER BEEN.  I COULD NOT FIND MY &#34;HOTEL CALIFORNIA&#34; CD SO HAD TO BUY A NEW ONE, AND JUST KEEP PLAYING IT OVER AND OVER.  I HIT THE REPEAT  BUTTON ON THE TITLE SONG JUST TO HEAR JOE WALSH AT THE END.  LOVE IT!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is a good book great drama great dialogue.i recommend getting this book. Great for people who love action. 5 stars
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Great movie, great acting superb plot.  This was one of Denzel Washington best acting job.  His performance is Oscar worthy.
B00DUCXFUC|5.0|I cannot explain the gravity of this movie in this small letter box. It would be a dishonor. Christopher Nolan and his crew have some of the brilliant movie making minds in the game, along with Zack Synder and his wife.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|I would give this game a 5_star rating but once you get to a certain level its almost impossible to get more dinosaurs without paying for them.  The expeditions in aquatic and glacier park never yield any new Dna without real money involved either.
B00ENXBUR2|5.0|I think this movie is in the top three for the superhero genre. What sets DC apart from Marvel, is that DC doesn't flutter their movie with bad jokes and poor dialog and terrible story. Charles Roven, Christopher Nolan and his wife, David S. Goyer, and Zack Synder and his wife are the best in the game right now. Move over Steve Spielberg.
0618871713|4.0|It was assigned to me by my professor, It was very well written and a very interesting memoir, Bechdel invites her audience into her personal life her and answers questions about her father.
B00992CF6W|2.0|Can you please update the game:):)?<br />I LOVE the game in all but can you please update your game<br />From Ian
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|This game is great for car rides kids  would love to play this game. It gets there mind really thinking about where to go
B0053TMP24|1.0|This is a very excitement book. I love this book. This book should be read by everyone in the word
B0093QDROI|3.0|I've never found martyrdom an attractive quality and Mildred Pierce takes it to a new level.  A bit far fetched. Even getting past that it was hard to care or like any of these characters.  I know it is a classic and I found it entertaining enough to watch it, but overall disappointed in the story.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Love this app! If you get the app today it is free! And I don't know why people say you have to sign in with Facebook. (I don't have a Facebook and I'm on the 20th level). Overall it is an amazing time waster!
B00G70WLJA|4.0|Love Hugh Jackman! I am a big fan of the X-Men movies and this one is just as great as all the others.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I love this app it has tons of gameplay plus a multitude of weapons. I'm JIST stuck because I refuse to kill a bear I only wish I could skip a hunt
B00BWLKTOS|5.0|I personally enjoyed the selections in their first CD more but if you enjoyed that CD you will also enjoy this one.
B00FAI2IUM|5.0|So far I've downloaded many of the better quality racing games and also deleted a few. GTR 2 is now my favorite.The graphics are beautiful and there are a vast selection of cars and tracks available.This game has knocked Real Racing 3 right off the pedestal.Simply more racing and less fixing.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|It is a really fun game. It is challenging, exciting, and addicting! It takes quite a while to load every time you want to play. Sometimes it freezes too. Without these technical glitches it would be a five star game.
B00EP0SIOG|5.0|This is a great holiday gift for the kids. This cute sphere comes with a lot of app games and can keep your kids entertained for hours. The nubby cover accessory that you can get as an extra purchase is perfect for giving traction, keeping it from scratching on all surfaces and it comes in different colors. I ended up playing with it for way longer than I should have and I had trouble giving it up to the kids. So I regularly mess around with it at night. If you love cute little gadgets this is for you.
B005LAII4E|1.0|They killed duke not a good look. I loved the first one this one had pROMISE BUT only the first 20 min are good!
B00AZMFK3K|4.0|Not the best Star Trek movie, but interesting and fun run through space, again, with the crew as young people.<br /><br />Not sure all the destruction to the Enterprise was really survivable, and Krik's brush with radiation poisoning seems a bit of a stretch, but then flying through space is.<br /><br />Fun movie.  Good acting, worth watching....you'll get to meet someone that comes back later in one of the best Star Trek movies, so definitely worth the time.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|Got it for free today! Holy crap it was epic ZOMG!!!!!!!! Friday through Sunday it is free. Get it now!
0670824399|5.0|Probably Dahl's best book, and that is saying something huge.  One of children's most gifted authors has come up with one most endearing and fun girls you'll ever meet.<br />She has amazing abilities to put &#34;nasty&#34; people in their place and we get to get guilty pleasure in how she does it.<br />Wonderful book to be read to your kids.<br />Blake's illustrations are some of the best you'll ever see.  Truly a wonderful addition to an outstanding children's book.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Very interesting.  Quite morbid in parts but that was the way it was in the day.  Could have used fewer sex scenes.  They were not vulgar but left very little to the imagination. This is the second time I have watched it and there are many parts that make me cringe and look  away.  Very well told and filmed.
B004J4WNL2|3.0|The fact that Cain's book has proved so popular and has so many reviews must prove that introverts (quietly reading) have been reading and commenting on this work. As a librarian, I am surrounded by introverts. In meetings especially with an aggressive administration we don't fare too well. Well planned and executed arguments get ploughed under. That is just the way it is. Mistakes are being made, but not my me.<br />I have just finished a number of items on military history (unsuccessful campaigns). Once again, those in charge are not capable of analysis or reading the data in any manner than their own. Mistakes are made.<br />I found that Cain should have had a better editor. She interjects every other sentence with an illustration, which not made in itself, leads to a rather disjointed flow. I read this book in the &#34;nook&#34; version and found that I had to go to a smaller type face just to have a paragraph flow. The nook version, doesn't include the footnotes in the text, they exist only at the end and then refer back to the text
B000FC2L1E|5.0|The Outlander series by Diana Gabaldon is my favorite series of all time!  Have recommended it and gotten many friends &#34;hooked&#34; on these books!  The characters are deeply drawn and constantly challenged.  There is at least one great love story and some great historical fiction!  If you can get past the &#34;fantasy&#34; of time travel as described in the first 100 pages of the first book, you will totally enjoy this ride full of adventure, danger, history, romance and moral dilemmas!  I do not re-read books.  However, I'm on my third time through this series over the past 10 years and learn more every time!  Voyager is the third in the series and it does not disappoint!  Scottish history, American Revolutionary period, both England in the 1940's and America in the 1960's--its all in there!  The next book in the 8 book series is due out in March!  A rich, satisfying read!  Start with &#34;Outlander&#34; and read them in order.  What are you waiting for?
B00C5R71U8|4.0|This book adds a lot of color to the world of Apple, and gives a first look at Steve's silent partner for many years. One feels better after reading this, about the future of Apple products and of those of us who benefit from their existence.
B00EJRSFC0|3.0|Antes de comprarlo pense que seria de verdad un pais inventado con toda su imaginacion, pero lo cierto es que Isabel no suele usarla mucho, mas bien se basa en recuerdos y personas que ha conocido, asi que me quede con las ganas de un gran pais inventado y en su lugar describe a Chile, lo cual lo hace muy bien y hay que aplaudir su forma tan simpatica de contarte las cosas.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I can't believe I actually spent money on this. I don't watch lots of television so I guess I missed something. Got through a few chapters okay. So far so good.  Then the thing turned pornographic. I wasn't prepared for that. I was not a happy camper. Didn't finish reading it. Do I recommend it? NO, not in this lifetime.
1616960922|5.0|Extremely interesting and intriguing story. Typical Brandon Sanderson to come up with a unique approach. He is very able to write about different cultures and adapt his story techniques.
1444777556|5.0|True story of Bob and worth reading if you enjoyed James Bowen's first book.  A love story between a man and the bond he forms with this stray, street cat.
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Very cute movie and it was great seeing it again from the comfort of my own home.  Recommend the movie to everyone.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Looking forward to seeing this musical but listening to this soundtrack makes me feel I am already in the theater. The score and singing are great and you can sense from this CD that the players enjoyed their roles in the musical.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|As if you didn't know. The only reason people stop playing this game is because the higher levels get harder, naturally.  They are hardest just before going to a new level, naturally.  Once you've played the same level for 30 days or more, it's time to quit, naturally!  But, you don't, naturally!  You have been warned. Don't lose your job over a game.
0140557741|5.0|Exactly what I was expecting.  I use this book as a leadership/teamwork exercise.  I have used it many times, and have purchased many copies over the years.
1451666179|5.0|Great fun to read and significant insights into living with mental illness, whether it be in your dogs or yourself.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Seriously?  Do I really need to review this movie?  I bought it because it was one of the best Batman movies ever.  I wanted to have my own copy to watch whenever I want.
B008602KQI|5.0|I had read the book and the movie was great! I would recommend it to anyone to see if they already haven't.
B0000AUHOH|2.0|The first four Star Trek movies were solid hits, ranging from good to great.  So maybe the franchise was overdue to strike out, and it took a big swing and a miss with Star Trek V.  After the first film was given a big budget and only got a so-so response, the studio started making Star Trek movies on the cheap.  Despite that, the trilogy of the second, third and fourth movies managed to look like big-budget Hollywood films.  Start Trek V looks more like a double episode of the original TV series - bad special effects, hurried production and all.<br /><br />The previous movie, \\"The Voyage Home\\", became a huge success by injecting a lot of humor into the Star Trek formula.  So they tried to duplicate that in \\"Final Frontier\\" - much of the first half of the film is filled with \\"comedic\\" moments.  Unfortunately, most of the jokes fall flat - they kind of come across like your least funny relative trying to tell a funny story.<br /><br />Then there's the plot, which just has so many \\"what were they thinking?\\" moments to it.  As an example, in a five minute or so strech towards the middle of the movie, we're subjected to a grandmotherly-looking Uhura seducing a bunch of mercenaries by doing an exotic fan dance, Spock knocking out some sort of unicorn-horse thing with a neck pinch, and Kirk throwing a triple-breasted catwoman exotic dancer into a pool table that's full of water ('cause it's a \\"pool\\" table, get it?)<br /><br />But the kicker is when we find out that Spock has a half-brother, who is the only Vulcan to reject logic completely and who became a spiritual leader with the ability to \\"brainwash\\" people by showing them their most painful memories.  What the heck is that?  You'd think after multiple seasons on TV and four previous feature films, Spock might have mentioned him or this mysterious power he has or something about his quest to find god.<br /><br />Worst of all is that this is supposed to be a major Hollywood sci-fi film, and the special effects look worse than things the Next Generation was doing at the time on TV.  It's just mind-boggling how cheap the effects in this movie look.  From the obvious model shuttlecraft bouncing its way into the docking bay to the visible track and arm that lift the hoverboot-wearing Spock up the elevator shaft to the \\"barrier\\" that surrounds the center of the galaxy and looks like the light show from a 60s Pink Floyd concert, everything about this movie just looks cheaply done.  And believe it or not, there were actually even worse effects that ended up on the cutting room floor (the bonus features disc of the Collector's Edition goes into some detail about a \\"rock man\\" that was supposed to chase Kirk at the end of the film - the costume looked so fake, they couldn't use it).<br /><br />And despite it all, there's enough good stuff in the movie (like the scene with McCoy re-living his father's death) that it could have been salvageable if it were in better hands.  But then there's the ending, which leaves the viewer with more questions than answers - what WAS that thing that was posing as god?  How did it get trapped at the center of the galaxy? How did it communicate with Sybok to lure him there?  Who built the barrier that kept it there?  From Shatner's comments on the bonus disc, it seems he pictured it as the devil, which I guess would mean it was banished there by god, but the movie never comes out and says any of that, probably for fear of offending certain viewers.<br /><br />The features on the bonus disc do their best to try to prop up this movie's reputation, but in the end they just make it look even worse.  The low point is probably the filmed press conference to pitch the movie to the media - it's almost like Harve Bennett and William Shatner are already expecting the bad reviews.  A couple of the bonus features hint around that there were people assocated with the production who realize it's a terrible movie, but you don't hear much from them.  It would have been niceif the studio had just admitted it and included some bonus features analyzing what went wrong.<br /><br />Yet despite all its flaws, I kind of have a soft spot for this movie, probably because it's so similar to the original TV series - hammy acting, groan-inducing humor, really low-budget special effects and a plot about finding a god-like creature that turns out not to be what it appears.  It seems like there were at least a half dozen episodes of the original series that fit that exact description, yet when the same thing is presented as a feature film, it bombed.  If anything, I think that's proof of how much the previous four movies had raised the bar.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|this app is the best it is worth the money it is so cool I say you should buy it
B002UBRFDC|5.0|James Clavell's series &#34;The Asian Saga&#34; stands the test of time, and continues to be one of my favorites.<br /><br />His ability to put you in that time and place is unparalleled.<br /><br />Start with Shogun and read them in order…I guarantee you will not be disappointed.
B0096DZKZC|1.0|This game worked fine when I first purchased it. I come to play it again and it kept crashing before it even loaded. I waited 20 minutes for it to update and it still does the same thing! Fix this!
B00BAXFJ5M|3.0|Have read all of Baldacci's books and enjoy the story lines.  Lately though and particularly in King and Maxwell a number of events move us so far from reality i.e. a shoot out in a mall food court that King and Maxwell walk away from after killing 3 bad guys.  Baldacci doesn't need this type of action to make his stories exciting.  To me the more believable the better.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|This game challenges you in different forms and levels. This game keeps me very busy and coming back for more challenges. It makes me think and the time given adds so much pressure to the choices.
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|Wholesome, touching, clean, and inspiring, this light-hearted film is appropriate for the whole family. I found all the acting to be realistic and very &#34;non-Hollywood&#34;, which makes it fun to watch for an adult audience, while the animations might make it interesting for children. Its fun to imagine the author's creativity and thought-process, especially as a child. :)
B002RI9ZPY|5.0|The Millennium series is the top of writing for my experience and taste. I can not say enough praise for the three volumes. Where I reside they have shown the film versions in Swedish -no subtitles. The cast of all thee was consistent. I have watched the and noticed how they went off from the original books. Not a complaint for it was obvious why they film makers did this.. The written books are the archetype of reads you can not put down.
B005779X4U|5.0|Replaced a similar, though smaller recycling bin with this one.  This is large capacity and easy to use.  Best of all, it keeps the putrid odors from empty dog food cans contained.  Got a slighted dented one for $30 less than perfect.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Reading this book is like taking a leisurely journey through a fantastical landscape. The mental images are exquisite and the characters rich and detailed. I didn't want for it to end. Read slowly and savor every page.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Fascinating novel.  I wonder if the movie will do it justice.  Orson Scott Card is a master science fiction story teller.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|I like how you show me to aim to shoot the deer and everything it's just so awesome I just love it.<br />Love Jenean Lopez age 8
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|Real zombies shuffle not run.  Too far fetched, I was hoping for something better. Still kinda fun.  Brad Pit was pretty good.
B00BLRXDTQ|5.0|The trilogy is finally put together with great audio and picture all around. Some people seem to think the old and weird color timing of Road Warrior was better but on a D65 calibrated screen it looks perfect here. That odd DVD color timing was a joke if you ask me. Anyway, all the films are here and they look great. Warner finally remastered Mad Max 2 and Beyond Thunderdome. Extras are not a huge deal to me so no stars will be disappearing for that. You can find a lot of that stuff on the internet and what they have here is decent. The commentaries mostly suffice though one is lacking for the third film. All in all for 25 bucks it is a great buy. The tin looks nice to me. I see nothing here that should detract from these films. They have never looked better.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|This movie is crackers.  It starts weird but finishes great.  I will watch this again and it will still be funny.
0785814531|5.0|it's beautiful hardback complete works of Poe. Great read. well done. great gift or for a home library. good buy.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|This  is a fun game that becomes challenging.  It also becomes addictive.  I refuse to pay for the extras, so I often get stuck on a level for days.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|wonderful 3 D Colors are great on my LG 3D Led TV set I enjoyed the movie a lot at the show so had to own it and it was good at home also
B00003CXPD|5.0|Beautiful family movie! It is a movie about being a good dad, about how a community comes together, about mentoring and love. From Billy Elliot's point of view is a movie about pursuing your talents. It is funny and dramatic sometimes.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Excellent movie!  Denzel never fails to impress with his outstanding performances!!  Denzel could carry any movie and make it great!
B00BAXFECK|4.0|I do not think this is quite the classic that some presented it as being.  It did more or less break up into multiple stages of the main character's life, but I thought all those stages were absolutely necessary to explain who he was and who he became.  It left me thoughtful about life at the end but not to the degree Great Expectations did at the time it was written  It is not suited for anyone who wants mostly action.  It is about people.  Perhaps more like the Kite Runner.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This game is absolutely amazing. I've been a DC fan ever since I was a child and this just brings my inner nerd out. All of the best DC heroes and villians are in here. If you like fighting games and comics, this is the game for you.
B0041D843M|5.0|Great, I really enjoyed reading this I thought it was well written and made lots of sense.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B004UJAOLM|3.0|Wuthering Heights is a very well written book. It is sad and very depressing in parts. It ends on a much lighter note. It is a very heavy story. Worth one read.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Plenty of hidden objects but, on the Kindle fire first gen. some are quite difficult to see even with the zoom feature. The hints are free and recharge pretty quickly and you WILL be needing a hint or two. I found the story meh but, the graphics were o.k. and overall I enjoyed the game. Fewer puzzels than most in this genre but, I am not all about the puzzels so not a big let down for me. A fairly straight forward game without many bells and whistles ....probably a bit over priced at $2.99, closer to half that would be about right still ...I did enjoy playing it and had no glitches or lock ups. one thing ....in many of the H/O pictures there will be an item just behind the list at the bottom of the screen. They can all be reached by using the zoom feature and adjusting the screen right or left. Hope this review helps.
B003VANOFY|5.0|This is one of the best Headsets ever, I had Crystal clear sound with surround sound! When I talked to people on the headset THey said it was perfect sounding. Also Really cool and customizable software
B005MMZ63C|5.0|Techniques and pieces of this movie can be found in most of the movies that came after it; even today. The only downfall of this version is that it is in a 4:3 ratio, rather than the original widescreen.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|fun game to pass time very stratigic but I enjoy playing it. only thing is wish I could battle people closer to my skill. other than that I love it.
B008Y5T5ZE|5.0|This is one of Johnny Depp's best movies. He's actually playing a human being and isn't wearing tons of makeup.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|i'm stuck at 347 and its a little to hard.  Its a nice but some levels are really to much for words.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Wow,  I thought this was just a chick book. One terrifying twist after another. Hitchcock as nothing on this woman!
B0055SWM08|4.0|I thought I'd give it a look; it looked like it might be fun. Yes it is, for sure. Now my problem is doing productive stuff on my Kindle Fire hdx. Or putting the Kindle itself down. Or turning it off?<br /><br />Seriously, this is a fun (free) app that I am happy to recommend.
1409136612|5.0|Anything by the late Maeve Binchy is top rate!  I only wish it had been longer -  I didn't want it to end!
B00005MP58|5.0|What adjective shall I use?  Majestic, Grand, Sophisticated, Romantic, Beautiful...?  6-hours is not long enough for some people to absorb all the wonders of this supreme BBC production.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is the best APP in the whole world!I have been waiting for this app forever. And now that I got it is amazing get this app now or you will regret it.
1878424319|5.0|This book helped me see my life in a new light. Every time I re-read it, I feel like it's a whole new lesson in life and love. The message of loving has been shared in many ways. This book spoke my language and is a book I will always treasure.
B009HUB40Y|1.0|Not too pleased with this game because the only way you ca play it is when you are connected to the internet. Most times I don't want to be on th internet just to play games. I prefer playing games off line so I do not use up my internet time.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|You should get tired of this after a few sets.  I played it until the widget to get to the next level started winking out faster than I could get to it.  That's just not fair, and I hate a rigged game.  If that's what you really want, there's always Las Vegas.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I think I may have attention deficit when it comes to these game apps. I had heard SO much about Candy Crush Saga and about how addictive it is that I had to check it out. It's okay, and kind of fun to match the candies and watch them disintegrate -- for a while. For me the novelty wore off quite quickly, and I had no desire to pay to advance to the pay-as-you-go levels. I played the levels that came with the free app and that was enough.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|Fast paced and FUN.  Some great twists and turns.  I thought I had figured out the end.  I was close.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This is a fun little app that makes you think ahead. If you're a fan of that then I'd recommend this. It has a nice selection of levels though they seem somewhat easy. Pick up the version with bridges to add more of a challenge.
B001NEK2GE|5.0|This is an amazing device, and one that I could no longer do without.  If mine ever died, I would buy a new one immediately.  I have had the Logitech G13 for almost 4 years now, and have never had a problem with it.<br /><br />In fact, I take the time to configure each game (if I don't like the presets) in order to tweak the keys to my play style.  One of the best features is that you can move your character with your thumb in MMOs, FPS's, etc...  For games like DOTA 2 or LoL, all of your characters abilities can be mapped to the keys, and you can move the map with your thumb.<br /><br />Those features alone make the G13 worth the money.<br /><br />In addition to that, I have owned this for 4 years.  I am generally very careful with my electronics, but on one occasion, I spilled hot  tea on the keys.  I took the time to get as much out of the keypad as I could, and to my surprise it still worked perfectly.<br /><br />I don't use the LCD much, but it does come in handy once in awhile.  I have an &#34;app&#34; for it that displays the temperature and fan speed of my GPU.  Kind of handy if you want to monitor things like that.<br /><br />Finally, having three different sets of keybindings available at the touch of a button is very nice in a few games.<br /><br />Overall, this is a gaming accessory that is amazing, and I will be continuing to use for years.<br /><br />[UPDATE]<br />I have now owned this for 8 years, and am finally replacing it.  I cannot believe how well this keypad has held up.  Even now it still works.  But every once in awhile the joystick &#34;sticks&#34; to the right just a bit.  Plus I've worn it down through use to a small nub.<br /><br />I'm buying another one, because for many games I can't imagine playing without it.<br /><br />WELL DONE Logitech.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Well written and was very interesting historically  I had never heard of this before but it really seems very likely to really have happened.  Characters were very real.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I loved this game and feel it deserves five stars. The puzzles are great and if you can't figure them out they have the button to reveal how to do it. I really love it but finished it in under an hour. So great but short basically. &lt;3
B005LAIII0|5.0|No time to comment or review the movie.  A great movie about faith and one reason faith is important in our lives.
B005RUV0NY|5.0|Great action, terrific storyline and just when you think a character is gone forever....<br />Best acted and filmed zombie series ever!  Thanks AMC!
B0002LMLSQ|5.0|Newest favorite cd.  Played during Thanksgiving dinner and received many compliments on it.  Good balance of mood... Bring nice ambiance to the entertaining space.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would have gladly given this app 5 stars if not for the ads that come up EACH and EVERY time you deal a new hand. VERY ANNOYING! I understand that the app is free, but they need to find a better way. Just saying.
B0064MPXFA|4.0|By most excellent writers who rarely fumble.  I'm of the school that it's necessary to like characters to enjoy the story, so the cool and secretive personality of the main character prevents me from wholehearted involvement.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|The newspapers and critics said it was a flop, it was visually more spectacular than the new Star Trek.<br />We watched it twice to make sure we didn't miss anything.<br />I think the special effects were on par with the new Thor.<br />All in all a very good movie to watch that is probably more interesting than it's predessors.
B00BP0O7QW|1.0|Almost new translated into a cut up book cover. I contacted the seller who sent another copy. That copy was falling apart. Not happy with seller although they attempted to make it right. Almost new should not mean cut up or falling apart.
B00EJX2YGM|5.0|This hopefully is not the last Twilight item. It is hours of a Twilight fix, and worth every penny. The extra DVDs with behind the scenes comments are great.
B00BAXFJ5M|1.0|I just finished reading this and it was a chore to make myself keep going.  The dialogue was so sophomoric that I would not have accepted it from my high school freshmen students.  Buy something else, anything else!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I was weary of purchasing the second book, because I was sated with book one, but this was definitely worth my time. I am completely engrossed with the characters and have loved every minute of this twisted love story. Onto  book three. I am so thankful to have found this series. Bravo!!!
B005D7ECMM|1.0|I agree with other reviewers here. The reviews should not be lumped together since they are different versions. The information on this version omits run time. There is no way to guess which version this is without a run time. So NO SALE until Amazon gets its act together and seperates the various versions or publicizes the whole truth about what is contained in each version. Really shameful of them.<br /><br />Having said that, the people who find this movie boring are missing several points, that might make Lawrence of Arabia the greatest hollywood movie of all time. Its still completely timely.<br /><br />1) The roots of the conflict between America and the Muslims are accurately revealed in this movie. Britain converted its navy from coal to oil just before the war started. Of course all the western powers immediately followed the lead of the British. The oil in the middle east became very valuable over night. So the west had a vested interest in conquering and colonizing the area. Oil became strategic.<br /><br />2) Lawrence is NOT A HERO. HE'S A LOSER. He's used and manipulated by the British and then when he's no longer useful he's sent home. Lawrence wants a great adventure and he wants to unify and free the Arabs. In the end the adventure is far more than he bargained for. He ends up responsible for the deaths of his guide, his young charges and he's forced to execute the man he saves in the desert. (His pistol is used to kill 3 of them, metaphorically it represents his naiveté.) His fame goes to his head and he begins to believe his own legend, virtually discarding his friends, when his real accomplishments, other than Aqaba, don't amount to much. He participates in mass murder against surrendering Turks. He fails to unify the Arabs. His diplomatic and managerial skills are inadequate. He only realizes that he's failed and has been used and manipulated at the very end when he's unceremoniously, and shamefully thanked then shipped back to Britain.<br /><br/>Lean said the only morally decent person in the movie was Anthony Quayle's character, Col. Harry Brighton, who also realizes, in disgust at the end, he too has been used to help them use Lawrence.<br /><br />That Lawrence appears to be a winner but is actually a loser is Lean's and more importantly producer Sam Spiegel's greatest triumph. He fools the audience into thinking war is a great adventure but if you watch closely enough, you see that its an ugly horrible thing that devalues and destroys the humanity in almost all it touches.<br /><br />In fact although Lean was a great director it was really Sam Spiegel's movie. He tried for years to have it made, and finally succeeded. This is a movie about manipulation, deceit, politics and culture at its deepest level and the best scenes are when Lawrence deals with the powers of each culture. When they use his considerable ego to manipulate him. Both the British and the Arabs use him to their own ends.
B007R21JJK|5.0|This board is performing just as expected and I am happy with this purchase. The BIOS is very good and easy to navigate. I installed i3570k, 16GB RAM, H80i and running the cpu at 4.4 on auto voltage and not seeing temps over 61° C. I like the reset/power button on the board. It also has an mSATA 'slot' which I haven't employed yet but may make sense to do so down the line. USB 3.0 is obviously awesome with your USB 3.0 devices.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|This movie was pretty creepy.  The wife and I were startled quite a few times.  More than once we wondered 'now, why the hell would he do that?'.  Some scenes are a little too real and disturbing and you almost would prefer some over the top gore.<br /><br />Anyway, if you want to scare the crap out of yourself, this may work for you.
0590129279|5.0|What a wonderful book! I hadn't read it since I was a teenager, and now that I am 56 and have had some deaths close to me, It means even more.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|An absolutely beautiful novel.  It was like listening to a story told by an old wise man of the south.  Best Grisham in years.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|WARNING: this game contains a cereal killing creature. very creepy noises and nowhere to escape.<br />I played this game and I'm still afraid to even look at the app. this game is the #1 scariest game ive ever played. and I'm one of the only few people that tried playing slender on the hardest difficulty with the volume on max and no flashlight. holy crap ill never do that again. if this is just chapter 1. I'm never going to test my luck with chapter 2
B004J4WKTW|4.0|I loved the characterization in this story. The scenes were vibrant and full of emotion. The writing was quite beautiful.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Running for about half a year now no issues. Running it at 4.4 (on demand) using auto voltages using an H80i cooler. Nothing over 61° C while playing Planetside 2 on Ultra. I'm happy with the purchase.
B004SBULWE|1.0|I can't get this app to work - it doesn't show the applications that are open (except the Advanced Task Killer app itself).
1840220554|5.0|I had never read Jane Austen. This book pretty much has it all. And a great price! The paperback is actually nice with these, because it makes them less heavy to tote around
B009EELBIS|5.0|Classic film with fantastic melodies, gorgeous scenery and universal themes-love of country, family and music!  Suitable for all ages and fun to watch together while singing and dancing along with the characters.  We're making it a yearly event.
B000NMY7CM|4.0|Enjoyed the movie.  Really lets you in to see what alcoholics go through.  Very sad.  Sandra Bullock does a great job.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The story is told from the viewpoint of Death and written in a strange way to start but soon settles down to a more normal writing style.  I enjoyed this book as much or more than any I have read in a while.  The book thief is a young adopted German girl and her story covers the late 30s into the 40s in WWII Germany.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|The best book I have read in years! I found myself stealing every minute I could find in my day to pick it up for even just a few pages.
B0055S348W|1.0|Couldnt get it to work and then it froze up my kindle fire hd. Worthless and it cost me all my coins to purchase.  Not happy!!!!
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|Love it! A Thousand Years and the rest of the music, including some remixes are just beautiful. As usual Carter Burwell did some magical music.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|Love this game. Puzzles start out easy but become challenging.  So fun to play if you only have a few minutes at a time.
B00GII9UCW|5.0|They achieved the goal of introducing these old standards to many who would have never heard them otherwise....and it's lovely to listen to.  I'm a big fan of both (bigger GD fan).  They sound great together!  I don't typically buy whole albums but glad I did this time.  I really enjoyed most of the songs (a couple are pretty dark and depressing).
B00EL6AAEU|5.0|A must see movie!!!  This documentary really makes us look at killer whales in such a different perspective. They are  simply amazing, intelligent, and graceful animals and should never be held in captivity.  I use to absolutely love Sea World and I will NEVER go there again!!!  They should be ashamed of themselves with their inhumane tactics!!!
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|If you love children's books, Renee Zellweger with a British accent and gorgeous scenery, then this is a perfect movie for you.
1401300529|5.0|This book lets you know how terrible war is.  The leaders thought the Koreans would be a push over and we would be in and out of Korean.  We were not prepared and this war cost us so many lives and lasted years.  You find out  General MacArthur was sitting in Japan trying to run the war in Korea.  Our troops had summer clothes and minimal equipment.  Terrible losses.
B0029O08WA|5.0|Although darker type songs than the other (in coordination with the darker happenings in the movie), it turned out to be one of my favorites.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love this book, I couldn't put it down, it was one of the best books I have ever read. I can't wait for the next one!
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This game is amazing and the last shot slow motion is amazing, for final kill on something kill is so cool looking. I just like this game if your looking for a game where u can learn how to kill different animals and know what there called
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Writing this was a huge task, one almost impossible. It was wonderfully handled, and a joy to read.  Thanks Robert and Brandon
B00EUUJID6|5.0|Love their music. These Young men are so very talented. Listen to their music daily at work. Great cd for the holiday saeson.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Never boring, gets more and more challenging with every puzzle. This is an awesome app, it gets soo addiciting! Love it!
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Great music! love it! How sad there won't be another one. The artists did a great job on these, as did the ones who picked the songs.
B004UID2LC|5.0|This seems to work really well and  it is smooth and functional. I also am able to find many of the videos that I want.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|This book does not deserve the public slaughter it has received in many of the Amazon reviews.  For all of the people rethinking reading the whole series because Allegiant diverged (pun intended) from your linear thought process - really??  This is not is a fairy tale - if you want that go and reread Cinderella.  This book is not particularly well written, but the overall themes and sentiment are consistent with the first two books in the trilogy.  If you read the first two, it is definitely worthwhile to read the third.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|An ending I did not see coming. A good page turning series. Can't wait to see what the movie is like.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I've been waiting a long time to finally see this game offered on the Kindle!  I've had no problem with the app at all...it's excellent!  My biggest initial concern was that I'd have to start from Level 1...but thankfully both my devices are synced.  Love it, love it, love it!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game! Easy concept but many very challenging levels. Will keep you interested.  I've been waiting forever for it to be available on kindle! So happy now:)
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|The book seemed to start slow but quickly grew. I couldn't put it down. It was a great story that reall held your attention. Loved it! Karen, Pittsburgh
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I play Candy Crush Saga, this is a game only for &#34;MOM&#34;.  I like the idea that it has a time limit on it, I wish that my kid's games were more designed liket this.  It makes me get off the game and i have noticed that because of this, I do not get flustrated when I play the game.  This is very relaxing and enjoyable to play.  Thank you.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|Have followed this series from the beginning and almost dreaded reading the last few chapters, knowing it is the true end of the legacy... This book completed the series with due justice to the previous tomes... wonderful and sad all at once!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Can't stop playing it<br />Sedgwick free r Djokovic r kid<br />Black black black black black a st Apple dog hat toupee
B009DCOU9S|4.0|Mostly hidden object mini games. A few trap in a room type puzzles. Story line is ok, nothing special. You have to complete a chapter (4 or 5 puzzles) before a progress save, but even if you have to leave before a save, it isn't like it is difficult to redo a puzzle. People that complain about the lack of saves never would have survived the NES days. Some of the puzzles have to small of a &quot;drop zone&quot; (chalk board puzzle) making it difficult if you are using fingers instead of a stylist. The hint system isn't bad.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Fun game!  Glad it can be set up for different ages.  Love the frequent updates.  Would recommend for ages 4-90.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Its like temple run but a lot more fun.  The power ups and many levels make this game great!<br />You should absolutely try it.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|Downloaded and it won't open. Uninstalled downloaded again played. Closed it tried to reopen and it wouldn't. Don't bother. I'm out .99 because to play all the levels at once it cost .99 I hate having to come back everyday to get a new level.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|Great game so far. Having fun will see how it goes. But so far it's been fun. Cool graphics and great fighting.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|It takes like 10 min. to open it for the first time. You can play Kungfu Scrat for 1 token ,or 5 acorns
B00AREIAI8|5.0|That was the first time in my life of me and the rest of us who are not allowed to be able to get a good idea to have been in my mind that is the best way to get a chance
0062082353|5.0|I read this before Chris was murdered and it helped me appreciate the man for his service to country and for his choice to serve his family and wounded soldiers with PTSD near the end of his life. Great book, great read, and his head never seemed to swell in all of his fame.
B0055SWM08|1.0|This is one of the best puzzlers on the market today for the Kindle Fire. However, it currently has a serious glitch that is forcing me to give it a one star. After finding the perfect solution to a level, I get a gold check, but when I turn the game off and come back to it, all the checks are silver and the game won't recognize that I've solved any of the levels perfectly. I can't recommend this game until this glitch is fixed.
B00F91H666|5.0|This movie is action-packaged and creepy all at the same time. Please enjoy with the lights on, and with someone nearby!!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|This is a book that I expect to keep by my side for the rest of my life.  It is full of empowering information.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|Flip Pix is the best app for these type of logic puzzles that I have found. The puzzles are well worth the price.
B00GX598FO|3.0|It was entertaining and brought back some lovable characters, but as sequels go, not as good as the first one.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I had fun playing with this app! It was easy to find and there are lots of helpful youtube videos for guidance.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|Great fun!  You have to totally suspend your perception of reality, but if you can do it, then you'll like this movie!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this app is awesome.there are many different  kinds of minions.there are also alot of worlds to play.U SHOULD REALLY GET IT!!!!!!!!!!!! :)
B00GT67UUM|5.0|VERY INTREGILNG GAME. LOTS OF FUN. GETS YOUR BRAIN GOING. HAS GOOD GRAFFICS AND IS THREE D EFFICES. CHANGLES FOR ALL AGES.
B00DSO9RMC|5.0|Terrific. Further develops the Moist character, with a few 'natural' twists and turns regarding goblins. Features lots of old favourites too. I seem to have waited a while for this story, but it was well worth it.<br />My husband, who rarely appreciates Terry Pratchett's humour but does appreciate steam engines, has enjoyed some of the plot-line  as well - that makes it a double winner in my eyes.
098478280X|5.0|This book gave the opportunity to explore for different solutions when I'msolving a problem, so it is really good because it let you know the problems in many different ways. Highly recommended if you want to apply for a tech company
1442369051|4.0|Very Good. History of the PC / Apple. Interesting example of nurture over nature. His intellectual and drive from his birth parents.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|candy crush saga is the first game I play each morning on my computer so I was happy to be able to play on my kindle.
B000FBJHZS|5.0|Very exciting from the first page.  I had trouble setting the book down to do other things. One of the best books I have read.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this game is fun. I am having some progress in the levels and sure. I am doing really good and this should be easy!!
B009IU6BIS|5.0|A GOOD NATURED &#34;GOOF&#34; TRYING TO BRING CHRISTMAS TO HIS FAMILY AND NEIGHBORS....<br />AFTER I SEE IT ANOTHER 20 TIMES, I MIGHT BE TIRED OF IT, BUT THE FIRST 20 HAVE BEEN GREAT..
B000YJ54DU|5.0|The Jack Reacher series is great. They say you don't need to read them as a series and technically I agree each book stands on its own, but it's better to read them from book one on through the series. Each book gives a little more insight into the Jack Reacher character and other recurring characters. I highly recommend this series.
B002ZG9846|5.0|What can you say about this movie except that it Kick's Ass. A great story about a comic book that is brought to big screen and done very well. A movie the whole family can enjoy when you take it in context of the comic book. If you have never seen this movie BUY IT.
B00004VXF2|5.0|Metal Machine Music is not for those who want to be comforted. It brings to mind the Threnody for the Victims of Hiroshima by Krzysztof Penderecki. It also reminds me of one of my favorite bands, Einst&uuml;rzende Neubauten. The best expressions of inner pain are rarely beautiful, but to those of us with open minds they are moving. One of the things that I admired about Lou Reed was his willingness to express his inner feelings without worrying about the opinions of others.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|King always manages to reach into hidden places in my mind and pull that red lever. This was masterful and my respect for the storyteller is unmatched. He also scares me, and that is why I will always keep drinking from that well. Read this book.
B00000DQSS|5.0|I still remember that when I was a kid and saw for the first time Kate Bush in the Wuthering Heights video. It left a big impression. And the older I got, the more I appreciated her music. So this is one of her CD's that I bought to complete my collection with music of her.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Kindle is good and useful idea and app. I don't get a lot a time to read but, I don't have to look for another book I misplaced. It's on my phone or tablet; now if only I could remember where I put my keys.
B007EC27QM|5.0|A perfect app for kids and adults. I use it for my craft shows and my son use it for homework.
0881033995|5.0|This is the book that we read to our children and we bought it so they can read it to our grandchildren. Brings lots of memories back of our children's formative years. A real fun book for the beginning readers which also imparts an underlying message of courtesy..
B007WEQ3K8|4.0|Interesting game, challenging and fun. A little confusing at times. Would reccomend purchasing it. I got it as the Free App of the Day.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Highly disappointed in this movie.  The plot seemed like a bait-and-switch from what the previews seemed like.  Very unlikable character, and a complete waste of our time.
B004VPAXHU|5.0|I still remember that when I was a kid and saw for the first time Kate Bush in the Wuthering Heights video. It left a big impression. And the older I got, the more I appreciated her music. So this is one of her CD's that I bought to complete my collection with music of her.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|Color note is so useful, I use it all the time. Now if only I could find it for all my devices.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|A great illustration of life in N Korea--not just the depravity, cruelty, and injustice of which we have all heard stories but also great insight into what motivates the citizens of the DPROK and how it is possible for them to think they live in the greatest country in the world and consider themselves blessed to live there and serve the Dear Leader. A great read!!
0143034901|5.0|The language in this book is nothing less than artistic. The story itself keeps the reader guessing -- there is no easy way out for the characters, and nothing is predictable. That it is a translation makes me wonder if it is a direct translation or if the translator made this book such a lovely and pleasant read. If you are a lover of language and a fan of complex plotting and fantastic ideas, you will love this book!
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Can't wait for the second installment.  This movie was good from start to finish and it keeps a solid pace with the comic book series.  Great start
B003U4UPHG|4.0|&#34;Lost&#34; is cleverly done and does hold one's attention, interest.  I wouldn't be watching so many episodes if this was not the case. I would have given it 5 stars except for: I am not particularly crazy about violence just for violence sake (this production is not overboard with violence so that is a plus), some of the plots leave one hanging for explanations as to the what and why events are occurring as they are, but if you just suspend your disbelief, and realize this is for entertainment, it works. Some of the events that are troubling are: the persons on this island seem to change too drastically from their previous &#34;lives&#34;, the doc is perhaps too adept at using primitive surroundings to perform medical &#34;miracles&#34;, what happened to the very powerful creatures that inhabit this island in the original episodes that we never really saw (did they evaporate?), just what kind of island is this (we never really know), there are too many bizarre places and things on this island, etc. I guess the bottom line is, so far, &#34;Lost&#34; does hold one's interest.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Still remembering Daniel Craig in his first James Bond movie, just making clear in the end of the movie that he is James Bond. Like that actor. First saw the movie in the cinema, impressed (again) with the location where it was filmed. And specially later in the film where 'Skyfall' came into the picture. Before I had all kind of ideas about where skyfall could come from, but not expected that it was named for a house. Browse the internet, and you can even see how it was constructed in Scottland. Love that area! So nice, foggy, mysterious, etc. So to watch those places of the world again, in combination with an entertaining story with action, I bought the Blu-ray disk.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This is going to make a good finale to the trilogy.<br />The delightful twist at the end is just perfect
B00D8HNR2K|3.0|Just sounds like another Nine Inch Nails record to me. Nothing new. Maybe it's time for a new sound. It's not bad but I just can't get too excited about it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great novel! I've now read every single one of Grisham's books. I hope there are many more in his great legal mind.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|Hunger Games was one I had decided I didn't want to see, but my granddaughter insisted, so I did and am glad.  Hard to describe it as &#34;entertaining&#34; because that implies some sort of fun and jolly experience to me!  However, &#34;spellbinding&#34; is more like it, and would recommend it to those who want to stay up with what the young people are seeing!  I have since seen the sequel, and could have been quite happy withOUT that one!
B00122OTQ6|5.0|So much better than when I owned this album on vinyl and played it so much that it dug grooves into the record. I saw Genesis at the Saratoga Springs Performing Arts Center, during the Duke tour and have been a devoted fan since. I do enjoy purchasing these digital remasters as they add clarity to the modern players when listening to them.

B00FAPF5U0|3.0|I'm finding the challenges fun but ridiculous stoppages and the blatant attempts to get you to spend more money just to contour to almost have me deleting this game. I do not recommend letting young people play this; it'll cost you a fortune!
B007F5S1GS|5.0|The Smiths - Strangeways, Here We Come (1987)<br /><br />Guitarist Johnny Marr has stated that he didn't think he could top STRANGEWAYS HERE WE COME and he left the band before it was released on the 28th of September 1987. But what the band left in the wake of this unhappy breakup is on par with anything else they've ever done - if not better. The guitar heroics of Johnny Marr are fully evident on every track and Morrissey's lyrics are as incisive and humorous as ever. Morrissey and Marr have stated they believe STRANGEWAYS to be the very best album The Smiths ever did. While I give that honor to THE QUEEN IS DEAD, STRANGEWAYS is nevertheless chock full of killer Smiths tunes. I really can't understand how anyone could be a Smiths fan and not love this album.<br /><br />Breakdown!<br /><br />\\"A Rush and a Push and the Land is Ours\\" - begins with a creepy old-fashioned melody on what sounds like a celeste or some strange piano but is actually Johnny Marr on synthesizer. Not only is Marr a guitar hero, he plays all the string and horn arrangements heard on this album on keyboard - very well I might add. Right away we hear Morrissey's vocal which comes in distorted and haunting, claiming to be \\"the ghost of Troubled Joe\\" who \\"traveled to a mystical time zone\\" only to miss his bed and return home.  The song has a fantastic keyboard rhythm and I love the xylophone touches. There's loads of great, biting Morrissey lyrics on this one too. Stands as a unique-sounding addition to the Smiths canon, and one of the best. *****+<br /><br />\\"I Started Something I Couldn't Finish\\" - announces its presence with a few bars of a dirty electric guitar chord before the full band takes off in unison. This is a rockin', rockabilly-ish number full of Morrissey's self-deprecating wit and a great choice for the second of four singles from the album (\\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\" was first, the third was \\"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me\\" and the fourth was \\"Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before\\"). ****1/2<br /><br />\\"The Death of a Disco Dancer\\" - \\"Love, peace and harmony...very nice, very nice, very nice, but maybe in the next world.\\" This song is just epic. By the end, Johnny Marr goes crazy on his guitar and Morrissey contributes some surprisingly effective piano work, the only time he's ever played any instrument on a Smiths album. \\"Disco Dancer\\" is another unique song and without a doubt one of their most impressive. *****+<br /><br />\\"Girlfriend in a Coma\\" - is really a sweet song, very melodic...one could find a hint of Morrissey's humor on this one but overall he plays it pretty straight, expressing the mixed feelings of horror and concern one experiences when someone close develops a serious health issue. *****<br /><br />\\"Stop Me If You Think You've Heard This One Before\\" - \\"Nothing's changed, I still love you, oh I still love you/ Only slightly, only slightly less than I used to, my love.\\" Hilarious! This is one of my favorite Smiths songs. *****+<br /><br />\\"Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me\\" - begins with haunting piano chords and strange background crowd noises which serve to paint a grey and dreary picture. Suddenly the song bursts open with soaring orchestral keyboards and Morrissey intoning the words in the title. This is a great song, both beautiful and sad, full of longing and weariness. *****<br /><br />\\"Unhappy Birthday\\" - \\"I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday/ Cuz you're evil and you lie/ and if you should die/ I may feel slightly sad but I won't cry.\\" The music makes this sound like a pleasant and upbeat little tune, but it's actually a poison letter to a lover who jilted the singer. Absolutely love this one! *****<br /><br />\\"Paint a Vulgar Picture\\" - Very cool song that not only trashes the record industry but also Morrissey's own status as a rock star. Great guitar, and I gotta give props somewhere to The Smiths' rhythm section, Andy Rourke on bass, Mike Joyce on drums. This band was the tops. Iknow this without a doubt having seen them live in Fort Worth on the QUEEN IS DEAD tour. Possibly the most fun I've ever had at a concert. There was a writhing mosh pit of love at the front of the stage and I got a piece of Morrissey's shirt which I used to wear on my jean jacket. Good times! *****<br /><br />\\"Death at One's Elbow\\" - is pretty much a straight-up rockabilly tune. Marr throws in some harmonica for that Boxcar Willie vibe. Cool song. ****<br /><br />\\"I Won't Share You\\" - This soft, intimate number is really something special. Surely one of their best songs ever! *****+know this without a doubt having seen them live in Fort Worth on the QUEEN IS DEAD tour. Possibly the most fun I've ever had at a concert.

B008JFUS28|4.0|Of all the superheroes who have made the leap from page to screen, Thor has been the biggest surprise, if only because he breaks so clearly from the most well established superhero narratives.  The most common blueprint for the superhero film finds an altruistic young man struggling with doing the right thing only to be given extraordinary powers that change his life and the world around him (see Spider Man and Captain America).  This narrative nicely fits within the hero’s journey narrative Hollywood has loved at least since Star Wars.  And then there’s the popular superhero narrative of a billionaire deciding to give himself to his community by mustering his extraordinary talents and wealth (see Batman and Iron Man).  The advantage of this kind of story is that the hero’s astounding wealth can ground the events in a world that looks a lot like our own, minimizing the audience’s suspension of disbelief.  But the world of Thor is a strange amalgamation of superheroes, mythology, fantasy, and science fiction.  In short, it is a bizarre hodgepodge of influences that only seem to fit together within the logic of comic books.<br /><br />And yet somehow the first Thor film worked.  A lot of the credit goes to Kenneth Branagh who embraced the loopier aspect of the hero, but still managed to ground the narrative with a combination of mythological family drama and a 1980s fish out of water comedy.  Despite the first film’s laborious finale, the movie succeeded on the merits of everyone involved.  The sequel, Thor: The Dark World, continues to expand on Thor’s universe, spending more time off earth and in the various Nine Realms.<br /><br />Thor: The Dark World opens once again with that ponderous signifier of the fantasy genre: the voiceover.  (I understand how this might be necessary in some situations, especially with the overwhelmingly large universe of J.R.R. Tolkein, but there has got to be a better way to build a fantasy world in the medium of film).  Odin’s voiceover introduces Malekith, the film’s villain who hopes to destroy the universe using a powerful weapon known as the Aether, a maroon sometimes liquid, sometimes solid object that also appears to have a mind of its own.  Malekith’s plans are stymied by Bor, Thor’s grandfather.  But he wakes thousands of years later, at a time when the Nine Realms are in alignment, which, lucky for Malekith, is apparently the ideal time for their destruction. This Convergence has shred the boundaries between worlds, which leads Thor love interest and scientific expert in technobabble, Jane Foster to become infected by the Aether.<br /><br />Malekith isn’t a particularly compelling villain.  His motivations are murky at best, and it’s clear that his sole job is to move the plot forward.  But luckily the much more compelling villain from the first film and The Avengers, Loki, has also returned.  For the first part of the film, Loki remains locked up on Asgard for his crimes, and he only gets released when Thor decides he needs his help to hunt down Malekith.  At this point it’s hard to imagine a Thor film without Loki.  His charismatic trickster has become the kind of villain you hate yourself for actually rooting for.  Likewise, Chris Hemsworth excels at being unselfconsciously charming as Thor, and Anthony Hopkins manages to be both grizzled and regal as Odin.<br /><br />But if there is one aspect of The Dark War that compares unfavorably with its predecessor, it’s a fumbling of the Thor, Loki, and Odin dynamic.  Kenneth Branagh at first seemed like an odd choice for a superhero film, but watching the first film, it became clear that Branagh’s knowledge of Shakespeare made him ideal to explore the relationship between a family of royals (I’m sure I’m not the only person to recognize parallels between Thor and Prince Hal/Henry V).  This is most evident in the character of Odin.  In the first film, Branagh and Hopkins crafted a complex image of a king who excelled at war and yet hated violence, who loved his sons and yet feared for their future.  When Odin banishes Thor, Hopkins plays the character as stern but melancholy.  In the sequel, Hopkins is given little to do but to stomp around being gruff.<br /><br />But in general perhaps the biggest asset the Thor films have is a cast intent on ignoring how downright goofy, if fun, the material is and giving performances that craft as fully realized characters as possible, even if their screen time is scant.  Ray Stevenson, Jaimie Alexander, Tadanobu Asano, and Zachary Levi (replacing Josh Dallas) all manage to make the most of their archetypal adventurers even while relegated to the periphery.  Each character could potentially anchor an entire film, so long as they also had a comic book named after them.  As for the earthlings, Stellan Skarsgard turns in a more comedic performance this time around, and Kat Denning manages to barely skirt annoying and manages to be funny.  The Thor films have enough characters to fuel five more movies without relying on the larger Marvel universe.<br /><br />The Dark World is directed by Alan Taylor who has worked primarily in television, most relevantly directing a number of episodes of Game of Thrones.  His biggest contribution to the Nine Realms is providing a more lived in feel to Asgard and a heavy infusion of sci-fi elements.  Branagh embraced the comic book origins, making liberal use of Dutch tilts and bright colors.  And while these are taken directly from the art of Thor co-creator Jack Kirby, Taylor’s slightly grimier vision works better on the big screen. Taylor seems heavily influenced by George Lucas circa 1977 to 1983.  Not only does he create a world with a little dirt and grime, but he also melds science fiction with fantasy.  The races of the Nine Realms are just as comfortable battling with sword and shield as they are space fighters.  This goes a long way towards really showcasing what a strange, baroque world Stan Lee and Jack Kirby have created, but grounding it for the film going audience.<br /><br />The Dark World is a case of one step forward and one step back.  Unlike in the first film, the plot moves along lithely, but in order to do so it has abandoned the psychological depth that differentiated the first film from other superhero movies.  But when this superhero craze started a few years ago, no one really expected a Thor film in the first place.  Asgard and the Nine Realms seemed so loopy, so melded to the page that a film seemed impossible.  Comic books have the potential to present an image of unfettered imagination at work.  The Thor films have shown that, despite the odds, this can translate to the screen.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|A nicely developed mystery, peopled with a good cast of characters.  There are no last chapter tricks to keep you from figuring out who done it.

B00BUADSMQ|5.0|More than twenty five years of Die Hard: time flies when you have action! One of those movies, where you are taken totally into the story, and forget everything around you! Great for entertainment! Love the Blu-ray quality: nice and crisp. And I'm sure that like the other Die Hard videos I've, once every several years, you watch then again! Never boring!
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Its most definitely a page turner but incredibly disturbing.  There were times it was hard to read.  An uncomfortable pleasure.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I've really enjoyed Hosseini's books so I was excited to read his latest. It is a gook book, but the second half is too detailed for me and I felt like I was trudging though to maintain the central story line.
B004JN1D2I|3.0|Not sure if this is the correct place to bring up the price of this (Kindle version) Game of Thrones 4-book bundle: A song of ice & fire series ..... but I happen to notice the current price is $21.99.  In October (just two months ago) it was selling on Amazon for $15.99.  Seems to me a bit of price gouging just in time for Christmas!  I have read the series and enjoyed it, and would recommend it to those who like this genre .... but wouldn't pay $21.99 for it.
B00BPDR3F6|5.0|Great family saga read with adventure, romance and mysticism. Colorful characters that continuously grow and change through out the book.
B00FGFVMGA|3.0|good graphics.  Cute storyline.  I had to use their hints almost all the way through bc it was not always obvious as to what they wanted next or what was not needing to be done yet.  Completed in 2 hours.<br /><br />Overall good game.  Wish it was longer.
B009O07NDY|2.0|The best piece of music from the film is still missing from both standard and extended versions of this soundtrack. The beautiful tune played during the rescue of the Eagles and their flight to Erebor is no where to be heard. Without it, this simply does not feel worth paying for.
B00F87ZUYG|1.0|You charged me 3x for the same product.  We ordered it a credit card did not go through and you still charged me.
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Denzel is great in another movie where he is not a like able character.  The movie moves at a good pace and is not predictable.

B000YMJA7I|5.0|Love Guns and Roses!  I got this when it was on sale for a song (pun intended) and love almost all of the songs here.  They did include some of the new stuff which was OK, but it includes a lot of classics too.

B00CV5ZPA2|3.0|When Yeezus came out, I hated it. I thought the lyrics were ridiculously bad and it just made me miss the old &#34;College Dropout&#34; Kanye. But, after I decided to go to Yeezus Tour, it changed my perspective of the album. I bought it on sale after that and re-listened. Lyrics are still not the best (ex. &#34;I be speaking Swaghili&#34;, &#34;eating Asian pus*y all I need is sweet n' sour sauce&#34;), but the album sonically is amazing. The influences of Chicago Drill, Trap and other genres work very well with Kanye's flow. The instrumentals are an experience in itself, and I would totally buy a single album of just Instrumentals if he ever released one. I like this album a lot more now, and I recommend listening to it again if you hated it at first like I did. He says that this album is like Bruce Springsteen's &#34;Nebraska&#34;, and he has to follow it up with a &#34;Born In the U.S.A.&#34;. Damn, I hope he does.
193700788X|5.0|I was hesitant to read the book after reading initial reviews. But, WOW, was it fantastic! I'm so thankful for this series that kept me entertained and \\"laughing out loud\\". Sookie Stackhouse has always been an independent woman who does things her way. To end the series with anything less would've been a tragedy. Thank you Charlaine Harris!
B0097HSS4M|4.0|This little photo app runs smooth with no glitches. Very basic program, but the quality of task it can perform is good.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Yeah, the end was really sad. I cried. But i thought it was a wonderful conclusion to the trilogy. It may be my lack of literary analysis skills, but I don't know how else Veronica Roth could have written it. I saw Tris and Tobias make the best choices they possibly could, being true to each other and leaders to everyone else. The story was pretty different from the first two books, but the characters were strong and the book made sense to me. I don't really understand what everyone is making a stink about. I would highly recommend this book series to anyone interested... just keep in mind it'll leave you feeling rather like you just finished the Hunger Games trilogy.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Such a good bingo game numbers all clear an it's not a fast number calling system . Have lots of different rooms to choose from . Plus you get to take part in the daily challenge .
B00BEIYGK2|5.0|I tend to read reviews on various sites after I see a movie or read a book and before I write my own review. Some reviewers thought the movie was too male-driven and that the women served as accessories. I  do think the primary theme was the unabashed love between a father and son, but isn't that nice for a change, and does that necessarily mean that women were diminished in some way because of it? No! If Tim's mother announces upon the news of her husband's terminal diagnosis that she is uninterested in a life without her husband, well, bravo for her! When men have the same feelings about the pending loss of beloved spouse, they would generally not express their feelings quite so unmistakably and intensely, but thank goodness we women do it without restraint and with absolute conviction. I felt gender-wise the movie was well-balanced, showing faults in female and males characters and showing strengths in both genders as well.<br /><br />At the beginning of the movie Tim describes his sister, Kat, as being &#34;just about the best thing ever&#34;. This is a man who values women! Even with the somewhat stringent description of his mother at the beginning of the movie, it is evident he  loves her deeply. His partnership with his wife that includes sharing child-rearing responsibilities, and the fact that he delights in his daughters is further evidence that this is not some male-character driven movie. In fact, when presented with the choice of having a son as his first child rather than a daughter, there is no question that Tim wants the daughter he had grown to cherish.<br /><br />Also, it was so nice for me to see a family that genuinely cared about each other. I loved that Mary remained just as determined as Tim to support her sister-in-law, Kat. What this movie said to me more than anything is that when children are lavished with love, it allows them to develop the capacity to be loving themselves. Let's give our children a chance to succeed in life by loving them to the core and through and through.<br /><br />I was already a huge fan of Rachel McAdams and Bill Nighy. I will definitely watch for other/more work by Lydia Wilson and Lindsay Duncan. I found Domhnall Gleeson's convincing facial expressions and mannerisms to have such a versatile range that now I have yet another happy excuse to watch the Harry Potter movies again.

B00B5HQL50|5.0|I love the James Bond movies but have really hated Daniel Craig's performance as Bond (even more than Timothy Dalton and George Lazenby's)... until this one.  I absolutely loved this movie although the loss of one of the main characters in this one was still painful.  That said I do think Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) makes a great replacement!  :-)

B009NQZVKG|5.0|I absolutely love all the Sigma Force novels and this one was no exception as I thoroughly enjoyed it.  Rollins is a great writer and while I think what he touts as &#34;facts&#34; in his books can be large stretches of the truth, he doesn't push them so far as to be outright unbelievable (well not in the Sigma series, one does have to wonder what he was smoking for works like Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull).  Never the less, this book was very very good and I find myself anxiously awaiting the next Sigma novel.  This is of course not helped with the way he ended this particular book... which of the two endings will be the path we move forward with in subsequent Sigma Force novels?
B000VZYPB4|4.0|Delightful.  This series speaks to my inner nerd.  If your are too cool - then it's likely a good deal of the material is going to go over your head or just plain unappreciated.  But as an avid watcher of the science channel, scientific documentaries and a player of MMORPGs - I find the content just plain hilarious.  And even though the characters are uber-nerds, the are still lovable in an arm's length, 'glad I'm not THAT nerdy' kinda' way.  And to have them foiled but the perky, sexy, not not too bright female neighbor, Penny, across the hall is just brilliant.  Great show.. Smart and funny.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love the fact that you do note have to be online to use this app. Great version of the Bible in an easy to use format.

0307352153|5.0|A must read for all the reflective introverts out there, especially the ones who understand that this is a society that favors extroversion and may have once or twice or several times in their lives tried to convince people that they were in fact the better-favored extrovert rather than the comfortable-with-who-they-are introvert.

B00E8S2JZ4|5.0|Love the movie. The extended scenes help flesh out the story. Nice to see Peter Jackson using the information from Tolkien's appendices to help flesh out the world of the Hobbt.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Twists & unexpected turns kept you turning pages. Hard to put down to go to work. Grisham never disappoints or fails to surprise.
B0040I09RM|5.0|unexpectedly a great show. sorry i didn't watch it earlier.ron pearlman and katey seagal are great . not a silly ahow
B00F35B8F8|3.0|If you are a Trekky fan.,  you wiil mostly enjoy this one.  The effects were very good.  The actors play the primary characters well (Kirk, Spock, and Bones).  The love connection twist between Spock and Ohura was questionable in my view since previous series/episodes suggested there may have been such a connection between Kirk and Ohura (oh well I guess the 5-year Voyage was boring at times).  Anyway, I recommend that you go back and view the original &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34; just to have the background info.  When you do this you will see the almost &#34;exact same scene&#34; in the nuclear reactor.  In the &#34;Wrath of Khan&#34;, Spock dies of radiation burns.  In the new version, Kirk is the one who dies.  I don't know why the writers did this.  I think it was in poor taste and made me feel like I was watching an old &#34;re-run&#34;.  What's the matter with those writers?  Couldn't they have thought up anything else? I would have given the movie a 4 star rating if it wasn't for that one scene which I felt was insulting to Trekkies who wait a long time between movies.  The writers should have come up with stuff that was entirely new, not a re-purpose of the old.

0316239879|5.0|I shared her interest in this beautiful little finch after reading an article on it in one of my artists magazines.  So intrigued that I set about painting a &#34;study&#34; of Fabritius' finch in oil. I now know each and every sleek and/or fluffy feather, scratch on his perch and can almost see him breathing.  It was amazing to read in her novel the same emotional descriptions I had felt when I first encountered this little finch.  Beauty, trust, pride, and sadness.  In my painting I broke his chain. (I pray he flew free, like a Phoenix from the ashes)
B0074D3CAQ|3.0|I thought this was going to be more light-hearted than it turned out to be.  It is the story of a bored and boring man in a boring marriage of 47 years who gets a letter from an old workmate, saying that she is dying of cancer.  He writes a short and insufficient reply and walks out to mail it but keeps going.  He decided that he owes Queenie something for not having defended her when she got sacked and that she will stay alive until he walks all the way to her side to apologize.  It’s a great idea.<br /><br />I liked the people who came on stage at different points in the journey.  They added a kindly aspect to Harold who accepted every one of them as other humans with a story of their own.  He is compassionate to each, though they create detours and delays in his journey.  Everything he sees and does reminds him of a world he has not been enjoying for 20 years and people he has pushed aside as well.  The author goes on a bit too long about his lack of self-respect and I get the picture that the walk and his rotting shoes are a means of self-punishment for his real and imagined sins of the past.  The description of his unnecessary inconvenience and pain gets to be a bit much, when he could easily have bought new shoes and raingear, but the focus is on his travail.<br /><br />There is a parallel story of his marriage and his tattered relationship with his wife, allusions to their son, and much pain in the family.  These things are resolved in the end, a bit too simply for my taste.  The writing was good enough if a bit too contrived and tedious at times, but the story was a good one that had more potential than was realized.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is a great tool for everyday organization!  The fact that it syncs across all my devices makes it my favorite everyday tool for keeping me together.  Added bonuses are the locality id and camera, voice recording.  I had to get a new phone and Evernote retained everything.  I highly recommend this app!
B0087SLR2W|5.0|A brilliant film. Loved the music (has a kind of an 80's feel to it), loved the cast, loved the action! Just had to own it on blu-ray.
B00004Z4SD|4.0|David Lynch's elderly characters are always a real treat. With The Straight Story he got to make a film almost entirely about quirky old people, only these folks are more grounded than his typical portrayal of geriatrics. That's probably because this story is based on a real life adventure of Alvin Straight, who drives a mower about 300 miles to visit his brother. The acting isn't always the greatest, but Richard Farnsworth plays the role of Alvin wonderfully.
B005XZHQKY|3.0|Ocean Wonderland is a very enjoyable movie.  The other two, not so much.  Overall, I am not disappointed with the purchase.
B00B7FOQCK|4.0|Its ok. Connections are a bit tight. I basically had to force the USB connector in the first few times.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|This book is so much fun to read.  The characters are well and kindly drawn and the story is deliglhtful.  The narrator is a man who seems to be afflicted with Asberger's Syndrome, but doesn't know it.  He is a genetics professor with two friends who decides to find a wife through a carefully assembled questionnaire.  His attempts at romance have been dismal thus far so a pragmatic, scientific approach must work better. Our hero, Don, embarks on what he calls, the Wife Project, wherein he hopes to find the perfect woman by subjecting candidates to his survey.  This way he can eliminate all the things he simply can’t tolerate, like smoking, vegetarianism, poor taste in music, alcohol consumption, overweight, etc.  He can deftly determine BMI just by looking at someone.  He tells it the way he sees it and, unfortunately, doesn’t lie.  He remembers everything you say and do and usually responds inappropriately but with perfect accuracy. Much of the humor derives from the narrator's social ineptitude and expectations of others. When he meets a woman who utterly fails to meet his requirements things become interesting, and, of course, a bit predictable.  But there is a great deal of humor along the way and the reader roots for our man to finally say the right thing.
B000JIN3J8|2.0|I love anything by Jane Austen. I have read Pride and Prejudice over and over. I rented the first episode of the 1980 BBC version on instant video and all I can really say is that I'm glad I did before I bought the DVD. The first hour was so painful, I couldn't wait for it to be over and I won't be renting the rest. The characters were given the wrong dialogue, it was done out of sequence (Mrs. Bennett telling Mary to let the others have time to exhibit at Lucas lodge, Jane saying the Mr. Bingley seemed intelligent after seeing him riding his horse, Charlotte giving her opinion of marriage before they had met any of the principle characters). There were some moments at Netherfield that were very precise, but it seemed that they were rushing through the dialogue to get it said and seemed out of breath at the end of the speeches. The bickering amongst the family at Longbourne was terrible. I own the 1995 A&E DVD and will stick to that for my P&P fix.
B00E9A656K|5.0|Having a lot of fun with this app. I am disabled, and it is easy to use on my Kindle Fire when laying down with my Geekorize stand.
B003U74NQW|3.0|Blue Velvet is a riveting film. I rewatched it recently with the belief that I would be able to stop it 20 minutes into the film and finish it the next day, but that wasn't going to happen. David Lynch does a great job of keeping the suspense up throughout the film, and the characters, in typical Lynchian fashion, are always fascinating. Where BV loses me is the whole &#34;there's a little Frank in all of us&#34; aspect that is never very carefully explored. Instead the film wraps up with a nice little bow with Frank dead, Jeff exonerated, Dorothy reunited with her son, and Sandy making sandwiches. Lynch doesn't really attempt to address the consequences of Jeff's Frank-ness, or Dorothy's recently discovered taste for being brutalized during sex, or Sandy's disgust for Jeff and Dorothy's relationship. I found myself agreeing with Roger Ebert on this one when he wrote &#34;If Blue Velvet had […] followed more deeply into the implications of the first shocking encounter between Rossellini [Dorothy] and MacLachlan [Jeff], it might have made some real emotional discoveries.&#34; Instead we get a trite Good-conquers-Evil finale with the robins of love returning to devour the insects of iniquity! Good has overcome and everything is once again right in Lumberton. I give BV 3.5 stars.
B005IGDW24|4.0|Very enjoyable movie.  I am not disappointed with the purchase at all.  A nice addition to every 3D movie collection.
B00EW9GQR6|2.0|Lady Gaga had a great pop album with The Fame.  That was enough to get me to listen to Artpop, but unlike several reviews here, I am willing to say that my listen to Artpop did not impress me.  I enjoyed the single Applause.  It was a better song than anything on Born This Way, and it even stands up well against songs from The Fame.  However, the rest of the album just doesn't provide me anything that I would want to listen to more than once.  When Amazon is selling Artpop for $6.99 and even less in a Lightening Deal after just a couple weeks of the release, you have Lady Gaga telling you herself that the album isn't very good.

B0019M2ITY|5.0|As usual it was delivered a day late, but I am thrilled with this watch and it was worth the wait.  It is lightweight - sometimes I don't even know I'm wearing one, and it's very pretty.  I was hoping it would be one of the thin watches, but it's not particularly big and it's very comfortable.  I would recommend it to anyone looking for a pretty watch that can be worn for special occasions or every day.
B00BC24NT4|5.0|It's delicate and about truth and lies both big and little. It held me to the end, seems he left it a bit ambiguous.
B004ZI0NLO|4.0|A thoroughly good read if reading is one of your interests if not you have no idea on what you are missing out on.Also I have heard that reading is good brain exercise as it makes you think and conjure up images rather than have the TV do it for you. It is Wilbur Smith at his best when it comes to action and excitement - Also he gives the reader a good insite into what it was like in Ancient Egypt - Taita the main character is also an interesting person - even though he is a slave he is able to live quite an independant life and is well versed in just about everything from medical procedures to building and architecture. By his brilliance he is able to work his way into being indispensible to people in high places and also has the power of second siight
0307730700|5.0|Definitely recommend this book to anyone. This would be in my top 5 books read this year.<br /><br />A husband, friend, son, brother in arms, student, this man was not the most intelligent, not the most gifted, he is very human and has shown many, I mean many many flaws and fallen many times, but with the help of people and many Christians he continues to get up and strive to be fearless and learns the meaning of love and never giving up.<br /><br />Who said fear and courage go together? This man has shown me how big a person's heart can be and I've shed some tears throughout the book.
B00F2HW20M|5.0|Three CDs of the live show's content, plus a DVD of the concert at the Hammersmith Apollo, nee Hammersmith Odeon where I saw Genesis' first UK date after PG split in '75. PLUS a behind the scenes DVD.<br /><br />Man, Hackett can play that guitar. I always wondered how he coaxed some of the sounds out of it, like the swooping sounds in Watcher of the Skies. Now I know. And he does it all so casually, like it isn't just about the hardest thing in the world.<br /><br />And the band is hot too, with a vocalist (Sylvan) who evokes Gabriel at times.<br /><br />I was just sad that there wasn't more of Hackett in the arrangements. After all, he is revisiting Genesis, not recapitulating.<br /><br />That said, you gotta check this out for yourself. This is what prog rock sounded like when the shine was still on it.

B00G4PX1MO|5.0|Kingdom is a fun game all around. My only complaint is that it finishes too quickly! I can't wait to see their future releases. Maybe a sci-fiction theme?
B000HF0ISC|5.0|I watched this movie on Amazon.  The plot was good, story was excellent.  The star power was impressive.  Highly recommend, but warning, the first part of the story is a little hard to watch because it is about child abuse.
B006WPWH4E|5.0|Love this game. PLAY IT AT LEAST 4 times day. Would recommend to all. All that I didn't like is not being able to tap the cards and the card would move.
1476733953|5.0|Wool is the perfect book--a whole world imagined, populated with interesting characters, with great plots interweaving--it's like reading &#34;Gone with the Wind,&#34; except it's science fiction.
B007WEQ3K8|2.0|Brain Trainer Special Pro is anything but a brain trainer and anything but pro. I believe this app may be an honest attempt by the developer to create a useful and interesting app but unfortunately it falls flat on its face. The app includes a menagerie of games designed to stimulate your brain and reflexes as well as a sometimes unclear set of instructions which can make each game initially confusing. The number of games included gives the app a quantity over quality feel. I gave each of the many games a day in court and just found them to be boring and repetitive with a few of them having frustratingly unresponsive controls. Far from the meditating silhouette depicted on the icon, this app left me wanting to break everything in the house! Overall the graphics and gameplay are amateurish and I took great satisfaction in deleting this game from my device. I might recommend the developer reduce the number of games included and just focus on making a few games that are top notch.
B004Q3UL2O|5.0|Great fun.  I enjoyed every minute of this movie.  I was glad to have purchased it. A good way to spend an evening

B00EDCI5IU|5.0|I listened to this album on a dark, cloudy morning, driving through small wooded Connecticut towns. This album made me feel like I was back in England, underground at Canterbury Cathedral, whispering prayers in the glow of tall candles that echoed off stone walls. This album envelopes you and draws you in. I advise listening to it when you can be in a quiet, peaceful place. So happy I found this album!

B00B2YH7BS|5.0|Some of the legends of rock music (and other kinds...there's an interview with Barry Manilow), great tunes, and the inside story behind a recording studio where some of the best albums in history were made. I'd never heard of Sound City before I watched this documentary and feel like I'd missed out on a piece of music history until now. Definitely recommend if you're into the history of rock music or recording.

B00F1BFRA6|3.0|Absolutely crackling with inaction, positively palpitating with procrastination, and racing along with all the speed of treacle flowing uphill, this Fourth Series of \\"Downton Abbey\\" really doesn't go anywhere, or advance the story much at all.<br />Keep your eyes riveted on the flower arrangements during the first two episodes, because that's where all the action is.<br />And those much talked about production values are definitely slipping.<br />In the second table shot, ...(there are quite a few), eager eyes will notice that the fish knife of the third place setting is slightly askew. (Ho-hum!)<br />Oh and later on even those new-fangled electrical appliances manage to steal every scene they appear in. You know you're in trouble when the gadgets become the stars!<br /><br />It's not until late in episode THREE that anything REALLY happens this time round. (And it's the ONLY significant event in the whole Season too!)<br />Before that it's just long lingering shots of Lady Rigor-Mortis (Mary) mooning and moping about in a semi-comatose state, dressed in her widow's weeds, and walking as though she has a broom handle secreted somewhere within her girdle.<br />She's just SO stiff and cold, and only livens up a little towards the last episodes, .....but it takes a tumble into some pig s*** to achieve this. Even that is so prettily handled that it manages to make the s*** look more like the finest Belgian chocolate. Which I'm betting it was for the shoot!<br />The storyline, ...(if you could call it that), tends to centre on Her Ladyship for this series but her mono-tonal delivery, white white skin, wraith-like appearance and inexpressive acting style are more suited to a haunting.....or a Mrs Danvers role perhaps?<br /><br />The other characters are not given much to work with here.<br />Ladies Maid O'Brian is never seen. Just an anonymous pair of legs and a suitcase doing an early morning flit from Downton at the very beginning of Episode One. We are only told that it was indeed O'Brian that was leaving sometime later on.<br />Bates is reduced to constantly creeping about and lurking in the semi-darkness of the lower corridors looking like some resurrection of Dracula. He doesn't seem to have many duties upstairs as he spends all his time looming from the shadows to accost people and looking positively sinister! His scenes with his wife are actually quite creepy really. He is devoid of any warmth now.<br />Wife Anna manages some very difficult scenes well, ....but the situation she's in then gets stuck into some sort of hiatus and doesn't really develop until the very end five episodes later.<br /><br />Long time devotees of this series will no doubt be pleased to hear that Elizabeth McGovern has maintained her acting style of tilting the head forward and peering myopically through her lashes.<br />It's comforting, because D.A. just wouldn't be the same without that.<br />The script seems to have forgotten that second daughter Edith was developing as a writer when we left Series Three, and having her articles published in a spirit of independence. It's not mentioned at all here.<br />Nor is her once fierce rivalry with Mary.<br />Dead Matthew's Mother Isobel Crawley mutates as we watch from her deep and quite touching mourning into something of a blend between Pollyanna, Florence Nightingale and Mother Theresa.<br />Maggie's Smith's jowl-quivering Dowager is now falling perilously close to caricature, but again she plays it very well, and her better acerbic one-liners can still raise a laugh.<br />Downstairs supervisor Mrs Hughes, who gets some of the best scenes to play, turns in a fine performance, but again, everybody is so \\"controlled\\" that all the excessive histrionics are left for the flighty little piece of new fluff upstairs, who is just so gushy and determined to be \\"thoroughly modern\\" that she seems to have walked in off the set of some amateur production of \\"The Boyfriend\\".(I was expecting her to break into \\"Won't you Charleston with Me\\" at any minute!)<br />Her cheesy grinning and over-acting was so supremely irritating and she seemed such an unnecessary and superfluous addition to the cast that I'd have left her back in ye banks and braes of the Scottish Highlands.<br />Dame Tiri Tekanawa has a brief cameo role as Australian opera singer Dame Nellie Melba, although her singing is the butt of some very derogatory remarks made downstairs by the new villain.<br />Oh and if you'd forgotten just how irritating that damned \\"ding-ding-ding-ding....ding-ding\\" theme tune can get, .....you are very quickly reminded again. It's repeated endlessly!<br /><br />I call this the \\"Series of Non-Events\\".<br />Some examples here in no particular order. ( I have deliberately avoided any mention here of \\"THE ONE BIG DEAL\\" in the plot. Anything below is inconsequential.)<br />MINOR SPOILER ALERTS!!!<br />1/ Lady Rigor-Mortis has the opportunity to remarry, and to a very promising man who professes undying love.....but she doesn't.<br />2/Deceased Matthew's recently discovered but unwitnessed will may be disallowed, which would dis-inherit Lady Mary, ....but it isn't.<br />3/The new triumvirate now running Downton are all set to evict the heir of a very long term tenant from his family holding.......but they don't.<br />4/ It looks like a new young gardener is going to be unfairly dismissed for stealing bric-a-brac from Maggie Smith's drawing room, ...but he isn't.<br />5/ Maggie Smith's character is made out to be dying at one stage, ...but of course she doesn't.<br />6/ The ex-chauffeur now part Downton owner Tom Branson feels out of place in the upper class and plans to leave for America with his young daughter , ...but he doesn't.<br />7/ It looks like Tom Branson is to be trapped into marriage by an unscrupulous re-employed maid feigning an opportune pregnancy to marry up into the cushy life, ...but he isn't.<br />8/ It is made to appear that the young footman who has ambitions to be a chef misses his great opportunity at The Ritz, ...but he doesn't.<br />9/ Mr. Molesley, a desperate out-of-work ex-employee who is reduced to working on the roads appears to have missed his opportunity of filling a recent vacancy at Downton, ...but he doesn't.<br />10/ Mr Carson staunchly tries to maintain his decision not to have any contact with his old vaudeville partner, ....but he doesn't.<br />11/ Evil Thomas (yes, he has relapsed since his apparent redemption last season) appears to be planning some great and nefarious scheme to benefit himself, ...but he doesn't.<br />12/ At one stage there are fears that Bates' wife Anna may be pregnant, ...but she's not.<br />13/ That new flouncy young thing at Downton annouces she's going to marry a ....Gasp! Shock!.....BLACK band singer, much to everyone's horror....but she doesn't.<br /><br />There are more than a few other examples, but suffice to say that the plotline consists of so many of these situations that have lots of potential, but then they are just allowed to fizzle out and the story creaks on maintaining the status quo as before.<br />Perhaps some of these ideas may be further visited in ....god help us, ...Series Five?<br /><br />Well what did I enjoy I hear you ask?<br />It must be said that once again there are some most beautiful settings. The apartment of the Aunt in London is truly magnificent. (Furniture and decor to die for!) There are also those aforementioned scene-stealing flower arrangements and of course the exteriors and countryside locations are all breathtaking in their story-book beauty. The briefly glimpsed tenant's farm is immaculate post-card perfection. The vintage cars, motorcycles and London bus are an enthusiast's delight, .....and even of interest to those who just enjoy seeing such well-maintained vintage pieces.<br />The costumes too are truly sumptuous in their detail, ...although some particular dresses get rather too much wear. This may be a continuity problem but I can't see those upper class women turning up in the very same frock again and again in very quick succession.<br />Overall the eight episodes are a quick watch.<br />I managed this in two night sittings, and I guess for me the frustration came from the lack of any real tension, or development of any of the set-up situations. That and the sheer predictability of the thing. You always know exactly where this is going, and that makes it fall into the \\"coffee-table book\\" genre.<br />You pick it up just to glance through the beautiful pictures, ...and on that level it succeeds very well.<br />The potential was there for this to be so much more, but Fellowes seems reluctant to carry on his ideas from his initial concept to some sort of interesting narrative.<br />The cast move about in front of the gorgeous settings like stilted paper dolls, ..beautifully costumed to be sure but shackled by the author's restrictive idea of period.<br />Yes, we know that emotions were restrained back then, but it still has to hold interest for the viewer. A cast full of people all so doggedly maintaining that \\"stiff-upper-lip\\" do not make for engaging viewing.<br />If half-star ratings were allowed I'd make this a 2½ overall, but as they are not I'm giving it the THREE stars, ....and that's primarily for the undeniable visual appeal.<br /><br />There will of course be those who find all I've written above akin to heresy of the very highest order, but mistaking the style that this show has in abundance for substance which is almost totally lacking will no doubt be a common enough error.sses his great opportunity at The Ritz, ...but he doesn't.<br />9/ Mr. Molesley, a desperate out-of-work ex-employee who is reduced to working on the roads appears to have missed his opportunity of filling a recent vacancy at Downton, ...but he doesn't.<br />10/ Mr Carson staunchly tries to maintain his decision not to have any contact with his old vaudeville partner, ....but he doesn't.<br />11/ Evil Thomas (yes, he has relapsed since his apparent redemption last season) appears to be planning some great and nefarious scheme to benefit himself, ...but he doesn't.<br />12/ At one stage there are fears that Bates' wife Anna may be pregnant, ...but she's not.<br />13/ That new flouncy young thing at Downton annouces she's going to marry a ....Gasp!

This may be a continuity problem but I can't see those upper class women turning up in the very same frock again and again in very quick succession.<br />Overall the eight episodes are a quick watch.<br />I managed this in two night sittings, and I guess for me the frustration came from the lack of any real tension, or development of any of the set-up situations. That and the sheer predictability of the thing. You always know exactly where this is going, and that makes it fall into the \\"coffee-table book\\" genre.<br />You pick it up just to glance through the beautiful pictures, ...and on that level it succeeds very well.<br />The potential was there for this to be so much more, but Fellowes seems reluctant to carry on his ideas from his initial concept to some sort of interesting narrative.<br />The cast move about in front of the gorgeous settings like stilted paper dolls, ..beautifully costumed to be sure but shackled by the author's restrictive idea of period.<br />Yes, we know that emotions were restrained back then, but it still has to hold interest for the viewer. A cast full of people all so doggedly maintaining that \\"stiff-upper-lip\\" do not make for engaging viewing.<br />If half-star ratings were allowed I'd make this a 2½ overall, but as they are not I'm giving it the THREE stars, ....and that's primarily for the undeniable visual appeal.<br /><br />There will of course be those who find all I've written above akin to heresy of the very highest order, but mistaking the style that this show has in abundance for substance which is almost totally lacking will no doubt be a common enough error.
B000ID37T0|5.0|An exclusive prep school student (Charlie Simms) far from home on scholarship takes a Thanksgiving weekend job as assistant to a snarly, alcoholic and blind retired Army Lt. Col. (Al Pacino). The campus background (Princeton, Emma Willard School in Troy, N.Y.) is quite impressive, but that's the least of this film's attractions. Pacino does an excellent job portraying this quite irascible character, and subsequent unexpected hero, winning a well-deserved Academy Award for doing so.<br /><br />Prior to accepting the position, however, Simms accidently witnesses some fellow students preparing a prank to be played upon the headmaster, and then finds himself in the position of either revealing their names or both being expelled and losing a sure scholarship to Harvard.<br /><br />Then Simms and Pacino to NYC where Pacino plans a grand finale to his now miserable life. There Simms rescues him through personal bravery and good counseling. At the end of the movie, Pacino returns the favor via a stirring defense of Simms before the entire prep school body, and becomes a changed (happy) man again and embarks on a new life.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|So entertaining, I have no negative things to say about this amazing book. I completely recommend this to everyone, so captivating.
1119963192|5.0|Swim Smooth perhaps is one of my favorite books for training the triathletes I work with. It helps you focus on a plan that will provide swim training using a variety of techniques to improve the time of your swimmer.
B00ESJICMC|5.0|James Blunt reach's us through his songs and touches the hearts of any one who has had an issue in life or a  broken heart or lost in love. He sings about life experiences and the war, things he truly has seen or felt first hand and shares it through his music.With his music, One man brings people together from all around the world who never met and makes them feel as if they have been friends forever!
B001NLL93W|5.0|It was exciting all the way through and there were many unexpected turns, but the ending event at the lake was great!
B0066W1AZK|3.0|It's a free app and so one must put up with the ads, but they're are unobtrusive for the most part. I like having the option to change the difficulty level of the play. The one complaint I do have it that the app loads upside down on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34; screen and does not change with the orientation of the device. I have to turn my device upside down to play this app. (This is not the only app I have that does this.) It does have glitches that cause it to freeze up at times, but again, the app is free...So, if your OCD can handle the orientation problem, this is a nice little app for playing a few games of chess before bed.
B00AKL1XPU|4.0|great game its really fun i<br />love playing this game and taking care of the animals and getting new animals and just creating your own little zoo  its so much fun !!!!
B00FXMGI0G|4.0|More interesting and dimensional than the first one, funny. The whole family enjoyed it. Great female characters, great action, John Malkovich is an absolute stitch!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Food read. Good story. Couldn't put it down. Loved the characters. Good to be back .in the familiar location from a time to kill.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|This was a gift for a friend and he still isplaying it. I guess the game is addictive. He really loved it.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|What Leon Uris did for Irish political complexities, Christine McKenna does for the Irish orphanages. She tells us a heartbreaking, uplifting story centered around, of all things, a personals ad in a newspaper. Well done. Thank you.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|I would love this is the stupid app would open in a proper orientation and the screen would change with orientation. As it is, the app opens upside down ans does not change with device orientation. That little bit of annoyance aside, there are a lot of different sounds offered to mix and match to get just what you are looking for. There is a bit of a hiccup in getting the volume bar for each sound to appear for longer than a split second, making it difficult to adjust the volume of each individual sound to your liking. The app has a fairly user-friendly operation, and you can save your personal sounds combinations/preferences. There is also the ability to time the app to shut down in predetermined intervals. Hard to believe this app is free. Recommend!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I can take my kindle app everywhere, it is a lot easier that having to take my computer with me.  Also I am 56 and my vision is not the greatest and I will never try to read from my cell.  Thanks Amazon!!!
B00CE03UOC|1.0|The game is just like laying out printed circuit PC Boards.  Do not cross the lines.  After playing 20 games (very easy) the game asked me to rate it.  I played another 10 levels and the game was too easy.  I then started pressing the hint button just to see what would happen.  After using 5 hints on one game a message popped up that I could have the VIP level pack if I invite my friends and let the developers spam them on FaceBook.<br /><br />I then used the 5 remaining free hints and I was told that if I invite my friends on Facebook I would get 5 free hints.  On top of that the game contains IAPs for pay money for the game hints.  I could buy 5 hints for $0.99 and I could buy 20 hints for $3.99.  I deleted the game.
B00DWZHTOU|5.0|I almost never watched Now You See Me, because I generally don't like Woody Harrelson (not the actor, but the way he portrays almost all the characters I've seen).<br /><br />That would have been a shame, though, because he's good in this movie. The sarcastic, sneering know-it-all character he often plays is a perfect match for the cynical magician he plays. Each of the other main characters is also well matched with an actor who seems made to play the part: Michael Caine as a moneyed investor, Morgan Freeman as a skeptical revealer of magician's tricks, Mark Ruffalo as two-steps-behind FBI agent trying to catch the magician/thieves.<br /><br />You begin with a group of four magicians brought together in a mysterious cabal, directed by an unknown party, and watch as they perform astounding -- tricks? feats of magic? All the while, your suspicions shift wildly; who is the mysterious unknown behind the act? Is it Freeman? Another agent at the Bureau? The dead magician whose tricks are referred to several times in the movie?<br /><br />The mystery is profound, and the magic act is stupendous. The final twist will have you going back to the beginning to replay the movie with that foreknowledge. And that's why I bought the DVD; so I can watch it again and again. Because unlike many a mystery or thriller, this one satisfies even when repeated. Outstanding.
B00G21XNKU|4.0|I love the Doctor who series. However, I paid way too much and got too high expectations on this episode. I think I was expecting more because the price gauge. I would recommend watching when price goes down or on someone else DVR.
B00FGFVMGA|3.0|quick game. nice graphics. I really loved it and it was a good time killer. I would recommend Fire Maple Games to anyone.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|I love it because my 5 y/o loves it. And whatever I can find to keep her occupied for a few minutes of quiet is a great, great thing. I sprung for the paid app in order to keep the child from constantly clicking on ads and getting redirected away from the game. It's a perfect little time-waster and functions well on my Kindle Fire HD 8.9''.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It was horrifying what they expected of young people and it is very dark to even think that something like this could happen. That is the hardest thing about this story, the total disconnection of real life and the Games. I gave this rating because it was well written and pulled me in right away and made me care about the main characters.
B00DJWV11I|5.0|This book is great. Read it in a couple days. Could not put it down. Wow!<br />Hope there is another follow-up story.
B00F91SCXC|5.0|I am not a zombie movie or tv fan but I really enjoyed this movie. This would be the first movie in years that I really enjoyed. It's not slow at all and keeps going from the first few mins.
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Love this look into history at how the entitled class lived in England at the turn of the century through 1920s, and the interaction between the servants in the house.  Sort of a high class soap opera.  My husband hates it, and can't understand the language with the accents.
B00B2JSRAS|4.0|My wife and I read this together and did all of the tasks. Some worked better for us than others. I truly believe in this stuff, I just have a difficult time getting past my old limiting beliefs. I think everyone should read this book and give it a go, especially if you have or are around children very much.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I just finished reading this book for the second time and loved it again.  The characters are written so you know their thoughts and feelings, ones you can relate to, with nothing left out, no loose ends and lots of twists and turns. The story goes from one time period to the other flawlessly.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Bible You Version  This was a really wonderful app for bible reading or study.  It has a host of tranlations which you may change instently and back to the one use are working with.  Thid would be useful to all bible students newly starting to oldest menters,
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Amazon.com has created the most important innovation in history! Teaching literacy to a new generation is a noble achievement.<br /><br />Professor Metze
B00B0LPYXG|4.0|Great movie! Denzel Washington is excellent in the role of a talented, gifted pilot and a man driven by his addictions at the expense of everything he values. Very realistic adaptation of a person that is a true, &#34;functioning&#34; addict in extreme denial.  On another note, I have flown in planes my whole life either for my profession or as an avid traveler and have no fear of flying...this movie made me nearly think twice about flying! Great footage! Definitely a must see film.
B002VT6C0K|5.0|Alice Munro has a special ability to write about the most usual people and places but make her stories so unusual in the end!  What a gift!
B00G21YLF6|5.0|John Hurt gave a stellar performance as a dark doctor from the Time Wars.  Steve Moffett, reputed to be evil for playing on our emotions, is,nonetheless, a brilliant, superb writer /director and it was fun to watch Matt Smith and David Tenant, side by side, Jenna-Louise Coleman and Billie Piper, in the 50th Anniversary episode.
B00ELD3MUW|1.0|Quits working, leaves junk, more trouble than it is worth.  Do not waste your time - more pest than help to me.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|When I was in the hospital a week ago my nurse put it on my Kindle, and I loved it
0399157573|5.0|Dust, the latest from Patricia Cornwell, is filled with intrigue and a ton of information and details about the characters we haven't heard before, most notably, Benton Wesley. The plot is fast moving ( I think the book takes place over a 24 hour period) and I had a hard time putting it down; I literally walked around reading it. From her unbelievably detailed descriptions of a scene ( you really feel as if you're there) to the story line which kept me guessing, Dust is another exceptional offering from a masterful storyteller.
B0094BB4TW|2.0|Facebook is way too intrusive. Big brother and his whole family prying into peoples business. Don't people value some privacy anymore?
B003KRJNBW|5.0|Great movie!  It is sad but action packed. Denzel Washington pulls it off again.  I can't wait to see him in more movies.
B005HEPIDS|5.0|I choose this rating because: Janeway first Woman Captain and Admiral in the future; she reminds me of a female captain Kirk. A lot of action, comedy and morals in every episode. If I have to rate all Star Trek my rating would be: 1st, Star Trek Original Series; 2nd, Voyager; 3rd, (Star Trek) Enterprise; 4th, Star Trek Next Generation; and last 5th, Star Trek Deep Space Nine.
B00992CF6W|4.0|minecraft is awesome. it is very addicting.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I argued with my niece that Candy Crush Saga was not available on my Kindle but was I surprised when she downloaded it right away. I had stopped trying.<br />It is at real pleasure to play for 2 reasons.....the screen is so much larger than my photo and the graphics are great, also, because I had to start over I am on 2 different levels and don't have to quit when I run out of lives on one.<br />Thanks for making it available.
B008LXZFH6|4.0|A quote from 13-year old son: &#34;It was stupid-hilarious.&#34; Be prepared for much immature humor. PG 13 is appropriate. Enjoy
006202406X|1.0|So disappointed with the ending. I loved the first 2 books but the third seemed to recycle the same plot. And the twist at the end literally upset me to the point that I wish I had never read this series. I was so excited for the movie but now have no desire to watch it. At least there is the hunger games!
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Brilliant game and excellent graphics. Very reminiscent of classic fighting games. There's an energy system so you can't play it endlessly, but I suppose it's for the best xD I love how you can upgrade cards and buy booster packs.I fell in love with it as soon as I started playing with it. And best of all, it's free! Definitely download this if you're a fan of DC Comics.<br /><br />The only reason why this is 4 stars and not 5 is because I really wanted a multiplayer mode to challenge one of my friends. If they could add this, even just for local, this would be perfect.
B00EENZ55O|5.0|When you can blend genres, elevate the various guest artist while the core displays musicianship integrity and harmonious creativity. Then you go directly to the head of the class the questlove and Meshell Ndege Ocello and the Jack Whites of this generation
B000SEI230|5.0|Absolutely breathtaking, from the very beginning to the end. Will most defiantly have you in tears all the way through.
B00G4EXNNM|4.0|It's a lovely production. A casual listener might even mistake Billie and Norah for  Phil and Don on a couple of tracks. If there is a weakness, it's that too many of the songs are sad, slow and reference natural death or killings. But they recreated a real 1958 LP, so they couldn't stick in a couple of more like &#34;Roving Gambler.&#34; As it is, the 45 minutes you'll spend with this exposes you to beautiful harmonies, and for most of the younger buyers, unfamiliar songs that have been around anywhere from 75 to 200 years. This arrived at my house today as a gift from a friend, and I'm glad to have it. I have been a fan of the brothers since they first recorded, and a fan of Norah since her first CD. I was unfamiliar with Armstrong, but have to say I am impressed with him.
0061564893|2.0|Intriguing but not persuasive. There's too much passionate advocacy and not enough evidence. Menzies wants this theory to be true, unfortunately, that doesn't make it so.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|This game is addicting once you get started the more you play you can't stop keeps older minds active like this senior lady
B00FGFVMGA|4.0|I loved the myst/riven/uru games despite the fact that I personally sucked at actual game play. This is a simple few hours of time to play, the only reason it didn't get five stars is that I felt it was a bit too short. Otherwise, I greatly enjoyed playing this and since it was AOTD you really can't go wrong. I will buy the other games made by Fire Maple just because I liked this so much. Now that I have played through, I will play it with my daughter and hopefully she likes it too.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Hated to let go of these characters. Can't wait to see if the movie lives up to the book. Excellent.
B006LSZECO|3.0|it was ok, did not like the ending, sounds like a sequel is coming, looking forward to see what the movie is like
0817439390|5.0|This book makes photography accessible in a way I never thought possible. Peterson cuts through all the complications of automated this and automatic that, and gets to the heart of the process. Understand aperture, shutter speed and ISO - suddenly photography makes sense.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good game!<br />Like the mind challenge and the hunt for clues!! Easy to finish with there were more levels, hope they create more.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Good for a summary of what's going on in the Facebook world, but no option to control what it decides to show you and what it doesn't.  Also no option to priorities most recent posts over what Facebook decides are the &#34;top stories.&#34;
B00FHATBGW|5.0|It is a very fun games. It has the great graphics and can be hard to put down. Lots of fun. A very interactive games even my eight years as r old son likes it
B00D0Z2JQK|5.0|Just watch the movie as I right this Review! I was very impressed. I don't have much to say that hasn't already been said about this movie other then its one of the  best DBZ movies along with wrath of the dragon and The first Broly movies! If you don't know! There is no english dub of this movie! People who are complaining  about wheres the english dub doesn't understand that there is not one, and there wont be one Until funimation has the rights to it  ! I not 100% how that works but if you look at the history of dbz. It took years for every version of every movie and the original sagas to be release on a english dub! Besides its still very enjoyable to watch with english subtitles ! This movie had a very good old DBZ feel to it. The original creator had a huge input for this movie and it show. It wont be the same without him going forward and I hope they keep this epic series going forever! All Hail Son Goku !!
B00GX59QO2|4.0|It's a lot of fun if you take it for what it is. Great acting by Mirren and Malkovich. Fast pace.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|its soooo fun I am a fan of the Pc one but when I saw this ... blew my mind
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I really like this game every kid should this game and it should come with every phone no matter what size and shape
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This is the worst book ever in the world<br />Why did you make this book· What kind of book is this why
B00GCE3TCE|5.0|Probably one of the best books I've ever read.  I felt like I was part of the story and every character was someone I knew.  Thank you Markus Susan for giving us a book to always remember.
B004SH40BQ|3.0|I bought it for iPod classic. I like the fact it can replace wired earbuds or car connection. If you carry it in your pocket it will sometimes cut out. Don't forget to unplug it or it will drain your battery. Another drawback for me is I have Slacker Radio (paid subscription) and Pandora on my phone and have access to an unlimited scope of music (my main reason for buying the iPod). With the iPod I am limited to whatever I have on it. I rarely use the device anymore. Not worth the $25.
B00ABGEFWC|4.0|This is helping my five-year old improve her reading. She loves getting new pets and caring for them. A great way to learn what it takes to have a pet.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love it! This is an addicting app that is very cool! You should really get it. You will not regret it.
B0024Y9EYS|5.0|A worthy successor to the original films. Strong characters, good suspense and action... and effective tension-cutting humor. Shame it didn't run longer, but a wonderfully-extended walk through the Terminator mythos.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I don't usually post reviews of books but this book was so terrible that I was angry when I finished reading it.  I loved Divergent and Insurgent and couldn't wait to read this one.  It was disappointing from the beginning.  This book ruined the trilogy for me and I don't even want to see the movies now because of how this ended.  It's like Veronica Roth hates her readers.<br /><br />SPOILERS!<br /><br />In this book, they find themselves fighting ANOTHER revolution.  Seriously, there is another government they need to overturn.  Where does it end? Four turns into this whiny, annoying person who is not sure of himself anymore because someone told him he was damaged.  Not at all like who he was in the first two books.  Tris is a know-it-all bitch who has to be right about everything.  Most of Tris' friends end up dead.  And then Tris dies!  Are you kidding me?  She survives all the gunshots, serums, and anything else thrown at her just to be shot and killed in the end while her brother, who was supposed to be the one who died, lives.  This series would have been better if she had stopped after the second book.
B00BU1DH1M|5.0|Rankin still on top of the game. Another really good yarn. The John Rebus character never fails to surprise. A book that leaves you wanting more.
B009KYXEY6|5.0|The first time I heard her and I was in love with her. Her voice is freaking amazing in every way! Lana, your voice gives me the chills. All the songs are awesome in this album, but my favorite track is &#34;Million Dollar Man&#34;. I feel like she's singing that song to the Moon and I! So yeah, this is an amazing woman with an amazing talent. Get this and you'll travel to her world!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book. It was absolutely incredible. If you're thinking about reading it, you should. I'm gonna recommend this book to everyone.
B00DY951RQ|5.0|there are some really great songs on here.  I was surprised at all the new material.  I listen to it a lot
B009G78EE2|4.0|Macklemore is one of the most positive and talented rappers making music right now. This is a very good album!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|A welcome return to the deep complexities of the first three novels and away from the repetitive fourth tale. The story of Bran becomes more developed and stranger and that of Jon shows a stronger character. Daenerys is still waiting in the wings and it is not yet clear how she and Jon and Tyrion will intersect.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Star Trek Into Darkness was an awesome movie!!! The whole family enjoyed it. Several times!!! The Blu-ray was a great !!
B00785P2QC|4.0|fun! i love sim style games. easy to progress in levels. wish it showed how many credits you need to upgrade item. only thin i don't like is when i click to play the game too many other game ads makes it confusing.
B00EY8AL1M|4.0|I've been a fan of this show since the 1980's when it first aired.  It got a slow start - Picard was all-too wimpy, Riker was a letch, but  by season 3 the writers and cast were in their groove.  My kids glued into the re-runs and today if nothing compelling is on the tube, we'll get into Amazon Prime and pull up an episode of STTNG - Season 3 has some classic episodes.<br /><br />From the DVD release, this HD version have slightly better resolution,  but the original filmed in a 4:3 aspect ratio so it will always be dated.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|Great beginning but his time in Jodi, Texas Dragged on for hundreds of pages and the aftermath of the assassination only went on for 3 pages and was so illogical.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is fun because you have to solve so many levels, and think how to solve it. Its a great game!
B00FOWX6NM|5.0|This is amazing case for people who want his/her iphone 5s to keep in same size just like you almost forget you do have case on your 5s when you hold it in hand, especially for the this great price that you pay for it. Just go to order it if you are thinking about this case.
B00992CF6W|5.0|LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!! So cool! Hey world it's me get this game! It is so awesome! Love this game so much
B00AB7HESI|5.0|Really fun game and works great on Note 2 also.  I just hope they bring the newer scribblenaugts over soon.
B0086QS7N2|1.0|I have been listening to this album for awhile now and it hasn't grown on me at all.  Sometimes an album is so sublime it takes time to appreciate (like &#34;Presto&#34; or Voivod's &#34;Angel Rat&#34;).  This is not the case with &#34;Clockwork Angels&#34;.<br /><br />I had high hopes for this album since the songs BU2B and Caravan (which were pre-released) are pretty good.  Headlong Flight was released about a month prior to the release and I swore that if the entire album resembled those three tracks, it would be another classic.<br /><br />Turns out those are the only good songs on the album.  And for the love of Christ, don't read the CA book.  Its even worse.<br /><br />Rush is still the greatest rock band to grace the planet (in my opinion) and I eagerly await their next effort.  I just hope it doesn't sound anything like this garbage
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|Better than the last one and its the truth. You can download it and have a greater time playing it plus (it's easy to rank up)
B00D1VKZ3M|2.0|None of Bridget's dilemmas are funny with the tragic undertone of Mark Darcy's death. Book seems to be aimed at narrow market of widowed mothers who don't have to worry about money as their husbands were loaded.
B00AGH6FD8|5.0|my kids love it,very interesting movie for kids. watched more than one,thank you very much. hope will watch this coming new year again.
B00EVW04PE|1.0|has roland emmerich ever made a good film?  what was I thinking?!?  I can't think of anything good to say about this film.  I suppose it wasn't the fault of the actors...
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I know I'm watching a good zombie movie when I'm watching the movie and I notice I'm at the edge of my seat and perspiring. World War Z met this litmus test. I had not read the book, and I know many who did were disappointed in the film. But I felt it was a pretty good story line, convincing special effects, and Brad Pitt turned in a good performance as well. It will be interesting to see if they decide to produce a sequel.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love the game play it all the time with my brothers and the update will come down so I will be so happy!! It is worth your money
B007REV4YI|5.0|Historically, I have liked the idea of James Bond movies more than I liked the movies themselves. Many of the older films have some action-packed moments, but too many lulls in the story to keep my attention for the entire 2 hours. Skyfall was completely different.  I was enthralled for the entire 143 minutes. The story and dialog were masterful and the acting was superb.  Almost all of the actors were perfectly casted.<br /><br />My only criticism is the casting of Javier Bardem. I would have preferred to see a different actor in that role.  Kevin Spacey was apparently offered the role and I think he would have been a better choice.  I have really enjoyed Javier in other roles, but this one seemed off to me for some reason.
B004EPYZXK|2.0|Apollo 18 (Gonzalo L&oacute;pez-Gallego, 2011)<br /><br />I had somehow missed, or forgotten, that Apollo 18 is yet another shakycam-found-footage “mockumentary”, but even after realizing that, I kept watching anyway. I don't hate those movies perhaps as much as I should, especially given that I am prone to motion sickness. And for most of its length, Apollo 18 is a run-of-the-mill found-footage horror film, nothing special, nothing great. Then you get to the end of the movie, and if you have any shred of suspended disbelief left, you will start throwing things at the screen and demanding your money back. Even if it's your TV screen and you pay eight bucks a month for Netflix and you watch enough movies that you actually paid all of about three cents to watch this.<br /><br />Plot: There were officially seventeen Apollo missions. Supposedly, Apollo 18 posits, there was in fact an eighteenth Apollo mission in 1974. (Never mind that shakycams in 1974 would have been a bit larger than shakycams today.) Ben Anderson (This Means War's Warren Christie), Nate Walker (Miss Potter's Lloyd Owen), and John Grey (Passengers' Ryan Robbins) were the personnel; Grey staying in orbit around the moon, while Anderson and Walker touched down ostensibly to deliver some sort of listening equipment. When they get to the surface, however, they discover that it's possible what they were told they were sent to do and what they were actually sent to do are two very different things...<br /><br />All well and good, and it is certainly the case that any number of found-footage movies, including The Blair Witch Project, have devised mind-stretching “how this footage got out to the public” backstories for the footage finally making it to the public, Brian Miller, the guy behind Apollo 18, didn't even try; if you don't get to the end of this movie and ask yourself where that particular piece of the puzzle disappeared to, you're way better at suspending disbelief than I am. For that matter, things get silly about half an hour before that, but this is a horror movie, you have to expect that sort of thing. And until then, if you can shunt aside the fact that this is for the most part the plot of an old X-Files episode (telling you which would give the game away, and to be fair to the movie I didn't realize this until a couple of days after I'd finished the movie), it's decently-acted if not great, it draws on the time period it's set in as part of constructing the mystery at the heart of the film, and the creepies are effective and not overused—a rarity in this sort of film. I wish I could tell you “it's Frost/Nixon meets The Blair Witch Project!” and, had this gone through another rewrite or two with an eye towards believability and continuity, it might have been. Unfortunately, it's not, so you're stuck with the skeleton of what might have been and a not-too-terrible first act. **gs get silly about half an hour before that, but this is a horror movie, you have to expect that sort of thing.

B00FATEJYE|5.0|So awesome I love this game so awesome you should get this game totally worth the space plus it's free
B003K15INU|5.0|This book is one of the best American novels ever. It is listed in Time Magazine's list of top 100 novels, and rightly so. The story is an American tragedy that spans several generations, from a Jewish immigrant, to his successful son, the protagonist, who takes over the family glove-manufacturing business, to his daughter who ultimately brings about the protagonist's downfall and destruction. This is a tragic story that takes place during the Vietnam War a very tumultuous time.
B008MM9630|4.0|In this game there's so much to descover if you love magic you will love this game well I hope
006114665X|5.0|Some reviewers think this is a revisonist work which attempts to lighten the blame traditionally placed squarely on Germany. This is not such a work. It is simply one of the best histories of the causes of the First World War, written with style and packed with information which is spun into one of the best narratives on the subject.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Excellent book to learn about the power of habits and the impact they have on our everyday lives and the choices and decisions we make. Fascinating with many real-life examples. Highly recommended to anyone interested in learning about how and why we do what we do and have difficulty changing our habits, but also how we can make those changes and the difference it can make. Interesting whether u have habits u want to change or are just interested in learning about them. A+!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|You love it is way funnier than temple run with your favorite characters even my grandmother like it . It will give you fast reflection for your finger
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|I enjoyed Season 2 of Game of Thrones just as much, if not more than Season 1. Since there are so many characters and interwoven plot lines, it took 2 or 3 episodes in Season 1 to really get into the story. But once Season 2 starts, you are well-acquainted with the characters and various story lines, and are thrown right into where Season 1 left off. If you enjoyed Season 1, I highly recommend you continue on in your journey with Season 2.
B00DSO9RMC|5.0|Very biased reader because I love all the discworld books. Just wish Mr Pratchett could write two books a year!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|All of my husband's favorites in one set. No more trying to find which one he wants, it's all in one place for when he wants a &#34;Star Wars&#34; marathon.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Very loud and bothersome. Perfect for rock hard sleepers like me. I suggest getting this app. And its free so what you got tooose? Download now!!!!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I was SO happy when this game came out a little while back and so I gave been playing it and suddenly once I got to level 50 it goes REALLY slow and then when I'm close to beating it and run out of moves, IT CRASHES. I am not sure if it's just me or anyone else has this problem but I'm not redownloading the game it took me forever to get there. I would give it 5 stars if I didn't have this problem...
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I liked this the least of all 3 books. It took me awhile to get use to the back and forth narrative.  I thought the \\"reveal\\" was a bit weak. Don't want to reveal anything but I just felt like \\"Really? That's it?\\"  I didn't despise the ending like some of my friends. Not ever ending has to be picture perfect but it left me disappointed and feeling blah which isn't a good feeling. Some people recommend skipping it but I don't. Just don't expect a happy ending.
B008OOYALE|4.0|Love the game but when I went on Amazon.com to give a new credit card # to pay for an in-app item, the purchase went through and my credit card was charged - I returned to the game and never got the Gold that I had purchased as an in-app item.  Plz can someone tell me who I need to contact - Thank You
B0039TD826|5.0|I wish there were more stars I could give this music.  I bought the LP when it came out.  Then I bought the 8 Track, then the cassette and this is my 2nd CD.  I lost the 1st CD I bought, thankfully I had it in my computer so I could rip a copy & listen to it while I waited for this one.  It says something when you've listened to the same CD almost every day for over 40 years,  Rip This Joint my favorite.  I blast it in my car on the way home from work & sing as loud as I can.  Great for venting!  I always make sure my windows are up and I'm on a busy highway.....I've been told I'm a terrible singer.  But alone in my car, it's Mick, Keef, Charlie & me.  Roll on, Stones! :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I'm so glad Candy Crush is finally on Kindle Fire!!!  When I'm away from home I don't always have access to a computer. This is so much easier than on my phone.
B00992CF6W|4.0|It is a good app and i love everything about it except the golden sword and golden pic because you can only mine 3 blocks with the pic and can only attack an enemy 10 or 11 times it really sucks even, a wooden pic lasts longer than both of them but if mojang fixed that it would make my day.
B001EN71DG|5.0|This is the original theatrical 'unspoiled' versions. It will be the only way you'll see Han shoot first.<br /><br />I bought mine new and you should pick up a new copy before they're all gone. Lucas wants the original theatrical versions gone. :-(
B000002LMM|4.0|This soundtrack contains major tracks used for one of the most viewed TV series in history. First three tracks in particular are part of success for the entire TV series. The Main Theme showcases the beautiful nature and goodwill of the town Twin Peaks which turned out to be not what it seems. This theme appears in the TV show in various forms and this soundtrack has vocal-added variation FALLING. LAURA PALMER'S THEME is also an oft-used track and shown in various forms and one of which is LOVE THEME OF TWIN PEAKS, particularly used in scenes for young couples such as James and Donna. AUDREY'S DANCE is used for major scenes for Audrey Horne who has a crush on FBI Agent Dale Cooper. But I doubt this soundtrack fully satisfies core fans who want all of the music used in the drama. How about the songs poor Leland Palmer sung during the drama or piano performance by younger sister of Donna performed by Alicia Witts?<br /><br />Verdict: Great Soundtrack and satisfies the basic need of the casual fans<br />Rating: 89 out of 100<br />Recommended for late 80s to early 90s TV drama fans.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|very compelling story written beautifully from a 15 year old boy's point of view with very believable twists and turns which keep you flipping the pages!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The description is amazing it makes you want to cry laugh and sing all at once it has romance and adventure and you can see through the eyes of a scavenger looking to stay alive! I highly recommend this book I know  it is long but trust me it's no doubt worth it
B000IDEORY|5.0|anyone who grew up in the 80s knows that this is a great movie .. jennifer grey and patrick swayze are the best in this
B00GGEV828|4.0|I have always enjoyed the Hobbit trilogy movies. Fantastic artistry in the making of this movie and great scenes. The actors are a great cast of characters .
B006YTTVHO|3.0|Pretty good; essentially a guidebook for the shy to use to come out of their corners and engage with the  rest of us. If you're looking for good ways to meet and involve yourself with potentially interesting people around you, this book could probably be of help.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Worked right out of the box...as expected.  Price was fair. Why does Amazon  require more words for a simple product?
B003L77G6A|5.0|who doesnt like the big bang theory. its so funny even my 7 yr old adores it . this is her christmas present this yr and she is goin to flip
B00B7Y0206|1.0|it doesn't download. its noteworthy to download I wish it would let me download I might of liked it to bad.
B000HKYNQ0|5.0|My husband really likes to watch the old Star Trek. He said the older T.V. show's are a far cry better than the movies they  made.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|The Game is fun, but they don't give enough moves to finish a level, juts when I'm about to finish it says level failed!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|i love penny . she reminds me of me ... i never get any of the jokes my friends tell .. lol...
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Best Superman film EVER.<br /><br />It doesn't replace Christopher Reeves' work, it is just much more of a dramatic retelling of the story that is much more believable.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|After enjoying season 1 and 2, I was anxious to see season 3. It definitely lived up to my expectation with lots of twists and turns. Now I am ready and excited to see season 4.
B00B5HQL50|5.0|great movie and a great way to end M career and start the new M career.  would have liked to see more gadges though.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Great murder mystery, great story, great ending. I loved this game. Has to be the best game on my kindle fire.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|its a great game! its basically like the other balloon tower defends games. its great. good amazing friendly erkle 20
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is a fun game to waste time on and if you had more than 5 levels. It is kinda hard for littler kids like 5-6
B00G2SIW7M|4.0|Like many others, I didn't care for it much but after a few listens, I have fallen in love with it. Really like the tracks Reflektor, Awful Sound, and Porno. The only flaw of it is that it's so needlessly long. Mainly because they have a track called Supersymmetry that is 11:17 long. It's the worst track on the album and should not have been on there. Cutting that track brings the total run time from 85:22 to 74:05, Which is a much more respectable and bare-able run time.<br /><br />Overall, It's a steal for 4 dollars (bought it on sale) and I would highly recommend it, Especially if you like their previous work.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this game is absolutely genius. it is fun and easy too. everyone who likes horses or animals would love this game. besides i haven't had any problems with it.
B000W178XO|5.0|Before i listened to this album, i had honestly never in my life really listened to a Johnny Cash album. After giving this album..(a lengthy one at that) a shot, i asked myself why i never listened to any other song that he put out besides Ring of Fire and any other song that might of been featured on the biopic movie. I definitely will be purchasing albums in the future.
1451627297|3.0|I like King, and have read many of his books. More than just a writer who goes for the cheap thrills. I welcome witnessing his development; to see him constantly changing; searching; getting better. But in this book I found hundreds of pages just droning on and on and on. A writing exercise for his pleasure? A bit self indulgent? I 've never thought King too good at telling a love story; he is way better at creating deep relationships between kids, or adult and kid.<br />Still ---I always love to get tied into a knot over the paradox of time travel.
B003G4W49C|5.0|It is very interesting to think about the future and it gives you a insightful glimpse into a strategists mind but a very good book
B0034DGP6S|1.0|Maybe it was demanded of the author to write a follow up to Eat Pray Love, but sorry, I found it a trite, self indulgant load of ******it.
B007KLY8FA|1.0|Terrible sound. MP3 quality from digitized vinyl playback. I bought this along with MJQ and both are horrid-sounding.  Stay away.
B00C061I1M|3.0|Good but disappointing.  I saw a video clip of Valerie doing something with her guitar that sounded more African-influenced.  This is more conventional.
B00DW2PDH8|2.0|The book was very difficult to read.  The timeline of the book jumped around and was very hard to follow.  The book has a dark theme.
B00B22ASUM|4.0|I Read this for  a book club.<br />Heartwarming story for any cat lover!<br />Gave me a new perspective on life on the street.
B000RO0ONW|5.0|1 Disc, 3 Great Games<br /><br />1. Portal<br />This was the initial reason I bought this set. I had heard about this amazing game, and I became a fan.<br />The game is incredible, with one of the most impressive engines I've ever seen, it's easily 100%.<br />The only issue this game has is its length, its a short game (I completed it in 7 hours),<br />but it did its job in being entertaining and intelligent.<br /><br />2. Half Life 2<br />I had seen picture of the protagonist Gordon Freeman before, but I never knew who he was. I really didn't care<br />about any of the other games on this disc, but after I played Portal, I gave Half Life 2 a shot. I can see, with no<br />problems whatsoever why The Half Life Games are considered some of the best. In terms of Story Telling, its great,<br />the graphics are well rendered, the script is perfect, and the game is a seamless blend of a first person shooter, a sic-fi which relates fiction to the real world (almost as well as District 9), and a story driven action story that will never lose its creative flare.<br />I could try and call this games first person shooter aspect out, but theres no reason, because even that aspect is innovative and<br />creatively original. I will say this game is 100%, it never lost my attention and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time, and<br />I feel it made good argument for a third installment to the series.<br /><br />3. Team Fortress 2<br />I don't have a whole lot to say about this game.<br />I think just about everyone who plays this game will have fun, and the overall atmosphere is just hilarious.<br />Its a bunch of animated action movie stereotypes duking it out, and believe me, sprinkle in some guns and you've got a great game. At the end of the day, this a strong 79%. Its not as evolved as Half Life, or Portal, but its a good time, with plenty of mindless action, and honestly, thats really all you need.<br /><br />The Orange Box as a whole is a 99%, it is one of the most unique gaming experiences ever developed, and I'm glad I bought it.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I thought this was a really good game. Worth the money. Some of the other games like g5 games are 4.99 per game.
B00CE03UOC|5.0|This game is a lot of fun. It is easy in the beginning and then gets challenging, but still solvable.
B00GH4RKYM|2.0|to much constant fighting, it was ok, then it just dragged on. Could have ended 20 minutes sooner and it would've been fine
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Great story when I read in 20+ years ago and still a great story.  So wonderful to have this.  I read this every holiday season.
B00006JJ2Y|3.0|Shut Up & Play Your Guitar Now Lou! I was at 1 of those shows at the Bottom Line NYC in 1978, Lou booked I believe a week there for the recording of this 2 LP set. I saw Lou outside the club at the stage door as I walked past. We said hi to each other. The show was good, different from seeing him in '76 at the Academy Of Music in NYC for the R&R Heart LP tour. This 2 LP set is a good representation of that show I saw & I'm sure all the rest I didn't. This CD/LP is not for all Lou fans and CERTAINLY not to give a new Lou fan just discovering him. Give them BEST OF LOU WALK ON THE WILDSIDE or DEFINITIVE COLLECTION or NEW YORK. This Live LP show was my 2nd time now seeing Louie. Well, the show was like a stand up comic with a 'jack' band behind him just making incidental no nothing music behind Lou as he talked out ANYTHING that came into his head.it was obvious he was not DRUNK but SPEEDED OUT. This is for DIE HARD Lou fan's like myself even if you rate it with METAL MACHINE MUSIC (like i do but a cut above it & which I abandoned!) as 2 useless Lou releases. Yes, I still pull out the JAPAN REMASTERED CD REPLICA I have of this CD from time to time and get through some of it. BTW: The Japan CD sounds GREAT!
1594481717|4.0|very intersting book ...... I liked several chapters specially the one about how to tell a storry and how to be creative
B00070DK1E|5.0|Jethro Tull puts out excellent music.I really like &#34;Farm on the Freeway&#34;. If you havent heard this song yet,it's a must.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Item has lot's of potential google needs to upgrade with more channels.  It works well. i had  little trouble pair it but i got it to work.
B00GLX1MG6|3.0|It was very funny but not enough for five stars. Some of my favorite comedic actors.This movie is worth renting.
B001QKSWOE|2.0|Rather boring. I used to love reading her books, looking forward to each installment. Now they are nearly the same, have the same conflicts, but the humor is not there anymore. I no longer chuckle out loud when I read this one. This is my last Janet Evanocih book that I will buy or read. Stephanie is no longer interesting for me.
B003ODIZL6|4.0|I think this book is good because it is very helpful for people that needs help finding different words<br />I mainly helpful to me because a dictionary and it makes people more smarter
B006GLM5EQ|5.0|One of my favorite series. Season 1 is what got me hooked! Great story lines, great characters, great sex scenes! :-)
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|Great Christmas Movie should be watched ever year or even through out the year .Children and adults will love this .
B00FXES5WS|4.0|Lovely Christmas listening music. Nothing exciting but very nice. Susan Boyle has a voice that is beautiful and this album doesn't disappoint. What I would like to hear from her are the Christmas songs that are not so popular and not the ones heard over and over. What comes to mind, \\"The Snow Lay on the Ground\\", \\"Once in Royal David City\\".
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Easy enough to get the job done with the books help. It turned out better than I thought it would.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|Really a good movie and it was made good...enjoyed watching this movie.  Another hero movie but done different which makes it right up there with superman! A must see!
B00DEFW8YY|5.0|I meant to rate all of these a five!  Don't count the one star mistake bump!  Helene Grimaud is awesome!
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is soooooooooooo cool you can upgrade your robot then fight it's so awesome and some of the game is based on the movie and some of it is not
B00ABGEFWC|2.0|Cool game sometimes it tells u u have to rate it or pay real money!!! This game glitches on me and freezes I really am not a huge fan but the animals are cute u should update it
B00ARN0XGG|3.0|This was o.k.  but still not too interesting and did nothing for me.....!  Seen a few of these ones and still bored!
0470474874|3.0|This book was helpful at first. Nowadays with Google, Googling the question or concern is much faster than flipping through this book!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love it. It was a great game I recommend it to anyone of any age . It's challenging as well.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|So when the new update came out I said in my head man I have to get that update! Then I did. And it was very cool!
B004PYWRQC|5.0|Action,interesting and not boring!  I enjoyed this movie and seen it more than once , its one of those kind of movies!!!!!!!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I read tons of books about NDEs but this one stands out in the league on its own! Beautifully written, simple yet so powerful. The message is subtle yet so strong. Just reading this book will change your vibration. Thank you Anita!
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I just started reading the book this morning.  I was doing laundry at 6:00 am and I asked for a free gift and I had my gifts (2) in my hands three hours later.  This may be the most important book I have ever purchased.  I think the key is to clear your mind of any negative thoughts before you create your intent.  Basically if you are in a bad mood postpone the experiment until you are in a better mood.  I will read more books on this subject but this book is a keeper.
B007EC27QM|5.0|I love this app.  My kindle is always at the end of my arm.  It keeps my goal setting, my to-do lists and now my calculator and My Day planner,Everything I need in the push of a button.  It's my library and My portable office.  I love how large the numbers are.  I use cheaters to read.  I don't need them with this app.  I can figure tips, commissions and sale percentages all in one device.  Love it
B008GWOVOA|5.0|Good movie and kept me going so its not boring and was interesting to see.  I would recomment it to others!
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Great movie! Of course Denzel is an almost guaranteed home run; I think he's one of the greatest actors out there.  This is a good movie with a realistic ending.
B00GH4R95C|1.0|Despite the ongoing violence, it was boring. Poor character development ... I didn't care about any of the characters, and frankly wish Superman had missed the opportunity to save her.  Really disappointing overall.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't know if I would care for this game. I am so glad that I downloaded it. It is however highly addictive and when you lose all your lives it is excrusiating to wait for them to recharge. You just don't want to stop playing.<br />I am really enjoying it.
B008Z9YGEE|5.0|I loved the beginning and the end and can't wait to see the new movie .  I was told different and waited to see it but it was fantastic!
B007N8RULO|4.0|Easy to play. Great for long trips. Satisfying and uncomplicated. Recommend game to all who are game aficionados. Thanks for opportunity.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is the best horse game that you can ever buy anywhere. It comes with amazing features and is very realistic. I highly reccomend this game to children and even adults
B00ECU34ZM|5.0|This film rates up there with The Matrix, Gattaca, and 12 Monkeys.  If all you're after are explosions, chases, and fight scenes held loosely together by an overdone plot, then skip this movie; you're probably not smart enough to truly appreciate it.  Besides, there are plenty of other formulaic, simple-plot movies with great special effects that you can amuse yourself with for days on end.
B00012QM9K|5.0|Who would not want to see this movie?  It was sad but History and like the real thing.  I even learned a few things at my age!<br />I have it because I just had to have it!:)
B00CE03UOC|3.0|This play fine on my kindle fire HD.  There is no challenge to this game.  This gets boring after a few minutes.  The game does as want to sell you 4 upgrades at 99 cents each. I gave this 3 stars for no Wi-Fi.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad we finally got Candy Crush for Kindle Fire!! Love this game!! I have it on ALL my devices!!
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Beautiful Movie of love and finding your soulmatel! Necar and Traci are Magnificent! Together they are passionate and mesmerizing! A Must See Movie! One of my favorites!
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Halestorm is an amazing group and this CD is awesome!  We absolutely love it; it is one of the best CDs we have ever purchased.
B00FQMZ5M0|5.0|Planes is a high-energy, attention-grabbing movie for toddlers to adults! My son loves the movie...waiting for a Cars/Planes meetup soon!
B008469DGY|5.0|Love it. Showed it to my gold loving friends and they downloaded too! Quite the hit. With the variable wind you cannot just hit the same shot over and over.
B00FWLDHSY|3.0|Was expecting a tad more intelligent storyline from this movie. Was expecting more from del toro. Maybe more scenes in daylight that at night...
B0017I1FO4|5.0|Great CD!  Could not have picked a better CD for our household of for me personally.  It is absolutely wonderful!
B000001F95|5.0|Hauntingly beautiful. The music reflects every aspect of the story. It's got everything, conflict, drama, romance, joy, grief. Love it
B00B5HQL50|5.0|&#34;THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST BOND MOVIES I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME!&#34;  SKYFALL has one of the creepest of creep villains played by Javier Bardem (NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN). Focused on revenge against M, he keeps Bond on the run to protect her. Daniel Craig and Judy Drench give outstanding performances as Bond and M. Absolutely love the references to the early Bond movies made by Sean Connery, the ultimate Bond. On my list of MUST SEE AGAIN!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game to pass time and pretty addictive good job thanks for fun game will keep on playing hope for more interaction with people in village to help do things
B008I43DYU|4.0|I bought this to see the other options and was surprised by the new looks. I am enjoying the different looks an I like the one that looks like paper. Great bargain.
B00B8R1NP0|5.0|I love to read a good thriller, be it crime or political, and Todd M. Thiede has now joined my list of the top crime writers. This is mainly because this book offers quite a change from the same old, sale old of other crime fiction, which has, in my opinion, gotten a little stale and repetitive lately.  This book is also very well written and the language is so gripping it pulls you right into the story. I could really feel Stephen Bjornson's panic in the first chapter!<br /><br />I also liked the basic idea that the killer is out to get &#34;Time Wasters.&#34; In this day and age we're all in such a rush all the time that we forget how to just be and relax.  This book's premise touched on the absurdity of that and when I find extras like that in a genre book it just makes the book that much better in my eyes. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well-written crime thriller with depth.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Reading it again!  After seeing the movie, want to go back to make some references.  Totally worth reading the book again.
B00G5G7FL0|5.0|I came into the theatre with average expectations, when I left I was amazed, I never expected it to be in my top 3 animated films along with the lion king and the castle of Cagliostro, as I want this review to be spoiler free to encourage people to see for themselves, all I can say is that I've never seen such chemistry, drama, and comedy working well in a 3d animated film. In my opinion it is the single greatest princess movie Disney has ever made, which should tell you that you can't afford to miss this film, it's probably the best film I've seen all year.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book. Enjoyable read. Action packed. Easy literary style. One for the whole family to enjoy. Looking forward to the next book.
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I like the theme that is being used in this game. Kids of all ages can play this game. I would recommend this game to those that enjoy quest games.

Many readers of this blog will almost immediately understand the reference to that Jewish Old Testament story of David and Goliath (1 Samuel 17 if you want to investigate). Perhaps most have read that story with the understanding that the message is one of hope and faith that a miracle can happen; that an underdog can overcome all odds and be victorious.<br /><br />Gladwell disabuses us of that notion. In a quirky weaving of new scientific data, highly refined informed guesses, ancient myth and modern hypothesis Gladwell leads us to understand that no miracle really happened. David wasn't an underdog. Goliath was. David should have won this battle. He had superior weaponry. As it turns out, a sling with a smooth round stone from the wadi (valley) is far more lethal, and lethal at a great distance, compared to a sword, spear and javelin wielded by the slow Philistine Goliath. Here's what Gladwell had to say:<br /><br />Twice David mentions Goliath’s sword and spear, as if to emphasize how profoundly different his intentions are. Then he reaches into his shepherd’s bag for a stone, and at that point no one watching from the ridges on either side of the valley would have considered David’s victory improbable. David was a slinger, and slingers beat infantry, hands down. “Goliath had as much chance against David,” the historian Robert Dohrenwend writes, “as any Bronze Age warrior with a sword would have had against an [opponent] armed with a .45 automatic pistol.”<br /><br />So you see what we thought, what we assumed to be true and what we were likely taught, was in fact not accurate. Gladwell goes on to relate many other stories with much the same lesson - The Advantages of Disadvantages. How many times are we cowed by our circumstances. We think we are disadvantaged and we in fact may very well be so. The question is do we look for the advantage in our disadvantage or do we give up. From Vivek Ranadiv&eacute;, to Lawrence of Arabia (T. E. Lawrence) Gladwell shows us how individuals turned an obvious disadvantage to their advantage against all odds.<br /><br />A common theme in these success stories is that the &#34;hero&#34; simply played by different rules. David said in effect, &#34;I'm not going to stand toe-to-toe with some huge Philistine, I'm going to rock his world (apologies, I couldn't resist) without getting within spear distance and certainly not close to that sword. Ranadiv&eacute; said he would coach his daughter's basketball team in an unconventional and entirely &#34;legal&#34; way despite the &#34;norms&#34; of the game he would give them all a chance to play their game. T. E. Lawrence could win because he was &#34;the furthest thing from a proper British Army officer.<br /><br />Gladwell uses these and other lessons to teach us about the &#34;Inverted U curve.&#34; That is a graphical representation that depicts the old adage that just because some is good doesn't mean that more is better. We reach a point where student class size, for example, can be too small for proper learning. I know you will likely object, but yes, there is a point where too much money is a problem - especially as a parent. Our children can be spoiled and their own lives made less meaningful by having too much wealth.<br /><br />Here's another myth busted. Go to the best University you can get into. Nope. Not necessarily true. In fact, perhaps downright Wrong! As it turns out, being the big fish in a little pond is best for the vast majority of people. Sure, if you graduate at the top of the class at Harvard you will likely do well. Guess what. If you wind up graduating in the middle or bottom half, it is very likely you would have done better going to a second choice school and graduating in the upper part of that school. Savvy employers select the cream of the crop at Harvard and then the cream of the crop at the secondary level Universities rather than the middle of the class at Harvard (just using Harvard as an example, not picking on them at all!)<br /><br />I could go on, Gladwell tackles Dyslexia, loss of parents at a young age, and much more. I think though, the best thing is for you to read this excellent book yourself and absorb the many important &#34;life lessons&#34; that Gladwell brings to us.l Universities rather than the middle of the class at Harvard (just using Harvard as an example, not picking on them at all!)<br /><br />I could go on, Gladwell tackles Dyslexia, loss of parents at a young age, and much more.

B00F8H0LM2|4.0|I purchased this for my husband who is a star wars fanatic and he loves it. It is a cute version of angry birds.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I love this app! It is so much fun, especially when you get the extra costumes for the console version.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|The story just continues to surprise, the acting continues to astonish and delight...I adore this series. This is so very well done.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|A very quick and easy way to transfer my photos straight from my camera's SD card to my iPad. I haven't yet used the usb connector, but I expect it will perform just as well
1119962846|2.0|Offers no help to anyone who can already open R - it's so basic as to be useless. It leaves out troubleshooting, higher functions and packages completely. Very disappointed with the size of the book yet the apparent lack of information. Not consistent with my &#34;For Dummies&#34; experiences which usually entail a good breadth/depth balance for beginners. It's especially sad because R can be a very frustrating experience for a new programmer and the other written references are often too advanced.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Each character in this book carefully created with great deal. Can not wait to read the last book. Well done.  :)
B007JNWJMI|5.0|Over the last few weeks I have downloaded MANY editing apps for my Kindle Fire, both purchased and free. This app far surpasses the rest in every way.  I was using at least two different apps to edit because one was missing something. Or the app was extremely difficult to use and there was no help. This app has it all and more. It's simple to use and if you need help there is actually a user's manual. I have not had to use it but nice to know it's there if I need it. I wish I would have bought this one first I would have saved some money.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I just installed the Google Chromecast and it is working great.  I can stream movies and tv programs directly from my Google Nexus 7.  Installation was a breeze and everything went according to the directions.  I can also watch movies that I recorded to my Nexus 7 with no problem.  I am very pleased with this product.
B00FAEPX9Y|5.0|This album is unbelievably good. Each song is distinct and beautiful, yet the album is a cohesive work of art that must be listened to from beginning to end. I can't wait to see what the future has in store for Lorde!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a very user friendly bible. I would recommend it to anyone, especially someone who is just starting out reading the Bible.
B007HUD6OS|4.0|pretty good book, had some holes but overall a good series.  I recommend this book for teens or teenagers.<br /><br />»EL TACO«
B000XUBFE2|5.0|One of the most brilliant and beautiful books I have ever read. You will want to read it over and over.
B00GH4RKYM|1.0|Im sure it's a great movie, but it Buffered about every 30 to 50 secs. It was very frustrating. I won't rent a movie again. This happened on another movie as well. Two times is enough.<br />Sorry Amazon, you need to fix this!
B003UESJDI|5.0|Great hard to find DVD. A must have for your movie collection. Love this movie. Big gemma Atherton fans here.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Exciting and easy read.  Very engaging, I wish there were more books in the series.  This series is better than Divergent in my opinion.
